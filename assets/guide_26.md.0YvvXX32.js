From his title of Butler (pincerna in medieval Latin) to King Henry I of England, he was called William d'Aubigny Pincerna to distinguish him from other men of the same name. Origins South door of Saint-Martin-d'Aubigny church From a family originating in the village of Saint-Martin-d'Aubigny in Normandy and born before 1070, he was the eldest surviving son of Roger d'Aubigny and his wife Amice or Avice. His brother was Nigel d'Aubigny. Career Not mentioned as a landholder in the 1086 Domesday Book, he was associated with King William II of England by 1091 and in that decade is recorded as an important landholder in the county of Norfolk. His involvement in central government increased after 1100, when Henry I became king of England. In 1101 he was a witness to the treaty in which Robert II, Count of Flanders pledged military support to Henry and is named there as pincerna, evidence that he was one of the chief officers of the royal household. As part of the king's court, he travelled with him and spent about a quarter of his time in Normandy rather than England. By 1130 he was also a royal judge, hearing cases in Essex and in Lincolnshire. Nave of Wymondham Abbey His Norfolk estates grew over the years, until in 1135 he had 22 knights holding lands in his barony there, and he also had lands in Kent. At Old Buckenham, the first castle was probably built in his time, as was the nave of Wymondham Priory, now part of the parish church, which he founded in 1107.Wymondham Abbey He was also a benefactor to his father-in-law's foundation of Thetford Priory and, in Normandy, to the Benedictine abbey of Lessay that his father had supported. When Stephen became king in 1135, William initially retained his place at court, but had died by June 1139, and was buried at Wymondham. Founder of Wymondham Priory William d'Aubigny, chief butler to King Henry I, founded the Priory of Wymondham in Norfolk, on or before 1107 A.D. The Priory of Wymondham was a subordinate cell to the Monastery of St. Alban's [St. Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire] at the time of its foundation. The Priory of Wymondham continued as a subordinate cell of St. Albans Abbey until the Priory of Wymondham was converted into an independent abbey in 1448 A.D. by a bull obtained from Pope Nicholas V. When William d'Aubigny founded the Priory of Wyondham, the Abbot of St. Alban's in Hertfordshire was Richard d'Aubigny, probably a close relation of William d'Aubigny. Richard d'Aubigny was Abbot of St. Alban's from 1097 A.D. until his death in 1119 A.D. Dugdale, Sir William, Knight.

He is one of the precursorsJacques Pugin: Light Painting Photography, 1979 of the Light Painting technique, which consists in capturing luminous traces during the photographic process, either via direct exposure of the sensor to the light source, or else to a lit subject. Jacques constructs his images by intervening either in the actual capturing process (incamera) or in post-production, using various techniques, such as drawing, painting or digital tools. If the subject of his early work was the Body, since then he primarily photographs Nature. A feature of Jacques Pugin's work is his particular focus on traces or signs, that indicate the presence of human or natural elements in the landscape. His photographs are a reflection on time, space and the complex relation between man and nature. Biography At 18, against his father's will, Jacques Pugin moves to Zurich to become a photographer. Suzanne Abelin, who runs Gallery 38, one of the first galleries in Switzerland dedicated to photography, curates his first solo exhibition in 1977. In 1978, he moves to his first studio in Geneva, where he meets many artists. He then travels to Greece, where he produces a photographic work for which he obtains in 1979 the Federal Grant of Applied Arts (Switzerland). He goes on to make the series titled Grafted Graffiti, using light painting. This series has been widely exhibited and published on an international level. Three years in a row he obtains the Federal Grant of Fine Arts (Switzerland) in 1980, 1981 and 1982. In 1983, he keeps working with Red Graffiti investigating colour technique. In 1984 he produces a series Toys. This series is in the collection of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and in the private collection of Mr. and Mrs Auer, who will publish the stills in the book \\"A History of Photography\\" in 2003. In 1985, at the triennial of Fribourg in Switzerland, Polaroid makes available a 50 x 60 cm camera with which Jacques creates the series The Polaroids, a series which now forms part of the eponymous collection. The same year, J. Pugin was entered into \\" the International Encyclopaedia of photographers from 1939 to today \\",Encyclop√©die internationale des photographes de 1839 √† nos jours, √©dition Camera Obscura MM. Auer, 1985 published by Camera Obscura. In the 1990s, Jacques Pugin becomes interested in the still images as they are taken from a video source, giving rise to a series of photographs entitled Blue Mountain and a book of the same name, with text by Jean-Michel Olivier, published by Idees et Calendes. His investigations then develop into a few series on the theme of vegetation. In the 2000s, he travels worldwide ‚Äì especially to African deserts, India and Latin America- for a large work entitled Sacred Sites (2002‚Äìpresent), supported by a grant of the Leenaards Foundation. Since 2005 he also devotes his practice to mountain landscapes, with his series The Mountain Shadow. In 2013 he finishes the series The knights of the devil, a photographic work with geopolitical scope started in 2008, about the signs left by the remnants of the civil war in Darfur. Works Grafted graffiti (1978‚Äì1979).Graffiti greff√©s, with the text of Christian Caujolle, 1982 In his photographs dating back to the 1970s, Jacques Pugin uses light as a pencil that allows him to draw within the photographic process (Light Painting). In this way, he uses a candle to draw shapes in the landscape or to highlight its contours. By modifying the appearance of places or landscapes, incorporating in his photographs traces that connect invisible links between present, past and future, Jacques Pugin invests his photographs with symbolism. Red Graffiti (1983). Investigating colour with the technique of light painting, the photographer uses elements floating on water or wind to symbolize the passage of time. Toys (1984). In this series, luminous traces highlight and bind bodies and toys that coexist within a given image. This work is part of the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Blue Mountain (1995‚Äì1998).Dieu que la montagne bleue est belle ! by Serge Bimpage in Tribune de Gen√®ve, 28.06.1998 In the mid- 1990s Jacques Pugin began to use computers as a tool to work on the image. Unlike Land Art artists, who work in a particular place using found materials, that they then typically capture, his approach is to shoot raw landscapes. He then modifies the image, using different tools, bringing straight lines or curves, and/ or adding shadows and light. In his work \\" Blue Mountains \\", he combines both infography and coloured pencil towards a pictorial result, halfway between photography and painting. Sacred sites (2001‚Äì2013).Sacred Sites, by Daniel Girardin, curator of the Museum of Elys√©e in Lausanne, Switzerland, 2006 This photographic work supported by a grant from the Leenaards Foundation began in 2001. The series borrows its title \\" Sacred Sites \\" from Australian aborigines living near Uluru (Ayers Rock), who give this name to what they consider to be their sacred places, surrounding them with fences to protect them. Today the artist widens this project by photographing locations around the world, such as desert, depopulated areas and natural sites. He captures traces that evidence human presence in the landscape and uses several means to highlight these traces in the image. His photographs are a reflection on time, space and the complex relationship between man and nature. Within this series we can find many enclosures, buildings, or traces of nomadic dwellings characterized by their circular shape. Jacques Pugin captures these places as though they were man-made sculptures made with natural materials found on site. Mountain Shadow (2005‚Äì2013).The Mountain Shadow, by Jean-Michel Olivier, November 2009 In this work, the photographer seeks to purify his images to bring out the essence and strength of the mountain. Working primarily on the shadows which then become traces, it redirects the glance and thinking towards a new inquiry. The knights of the devil (2008‚Äì2013).The knights of the devil For the first time in his career, Jacques Pugin has chosen to work on images that are not his own, using clich√©s that are borrowed from the internet, namely satellite images taken from Google Earth. This time, the traces are the vestiges of the civil war in Darfur: abuse performed by the Janjawids, (the knights of the devil) who raped the women, killed the children, slaughtered the population, before burning the villages, leaving nothing but the ashes of homes and fences. Jacques Pugin has chosen to apply to his images a double treatment : firstly, by draining all color, turning them into black and white, and secondly, by inverting them, pointing to the symbolic and fundamentally dark, negative nature of the barbarity that they witness. If this work can be seen to belong to the Pugin's continued researched on traces started in 1979, with the Grafted graffiti series, this time his drive is primarily a political one. Conscious of journalists' lack of access into the Darfur region, the artist questions the role of the internet by indirectly transforming Google Earth into a reporting tool that witnesses from high above.

The River Quaggy runs through the park, and it has an athletics track and outdoor gym. It received a Green Flag award for 2012-13. History The site was formerly known as Harrow Meadow. It was prone to flooding, and in the 1930s, when the surrounding area was being developed for housing, Woolwich Metropolitan Borough Council culverted the River Quaggy and laid out the site as playing fields. It was opened as a park in 1937, named after a former borough engineer. The area around the park still suffered from flooding, and in the 1990s the ground level was lowered in part of the park to hold flood waters, while the river was restored to meander at ground level.

The term \\"gut‚Äìbrain axis\\" is occasionally used to refer to the role of the gut flora in the interplay as well, whereas the term \\"microbiota‚Äìgut‚Äìbrain (MGB or BGM) axis\\" explicitly includes the role of gut flora in the biochemical signaling events that take place between the GI tract and CNS. cited in: Broadly defined, the gut‚Äìbrain axis includes the central nervous system, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, including the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis (HPA axis), sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system, including the enteric nervous system and the vagus nerve, and the gut microbiota. The first of the brain‚Äìgut interactions shown, was the cephalic phase of digestion, in the release of gastric and pancreatic secretions in response to sensory signals, such as the smell and sight of food. This was first demonstrated by Pavlov. Interest in the field was sparked by a 2004 study showing that germ-free (GF) mice showed an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress compared to non-GF laboratory mice. As of October 2016, most of the work done on the role of gut flora in the gut‚Äìbrain axis had been conducted in animals, or on characterizing the various neuroactive compounds that gut flora can produce. Studies with humans ‚Äì measuring variations in gut flora between people with various psychiatric and neurological conditions or when stressed, or measuring effects of various probiotics (dubbed \\"psychobiotics\\" in this context) ‚Äì had generally been small and were just beginning to be generalized. Whether changes to gut flora are a result of disease, a cause of disease, or both in any number of possible feedback loops in the gut‚Äìbrain axis, remained unclear.  Gut flora  Bifidobacterium adolescentis Gram Lactobacillus sp 01 The gut flora is the complex community of microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals. The gut metagenome is the aggregate of all the genomes of gut microbiota. The gut is one niche that human microbiota inhabit. In humans, the gut microbiota has the largest quantity of bacteria and the greatest number of species, compared to other areas of the body. In humans, the gut flora is established at one to two years after birth; by that time, the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier that it secretes have co-developed in a way that is tolerant to, and even supportive of, the gut flora and that also provides a barrier to pathogenic organisms. The relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non- harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship. Human gut microorganisms benefit the host by collecting the energy from the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates and the subsequent absorption of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Intestinal bacteria also play a role in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics. The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ; dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. The composition of human gut flora changes over time, when the diet changes, and as overall health changes.  Enteric nervous system  The enteric nervous system is one of the main divisions of the nervous system and consists of a mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal system; it has been described as a \\"second brain\\" for several reasons. The enteric nervous system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the parasympathetic (e.g., via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic (e.g., via the prevertebral ganglia) nervous systems. However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function. In vertebrates, the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons, afferent neurons, and interneurons, all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes in the absence of CNS input. The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions. Through intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control peristalsis and churning of intestinal contents. Other neurons control the secretion of enzymes. The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 neurotransmitters, most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the body's dopamine; the dual function of these neurotransmitters is an active part of gut‚Äìbrain research. The first of the gut‚Äìbrain interactions was shown to be between the sight and smell of food and the release of gastric secretions, known as the cephalic phase, or cephalic response of digestion.  Gut‚Äìbrain integration  The gut‚Äìbrain axis, a bidirectional neurohumoral communication system, is important for maintaining homeostasis and is regulated through the central and enteric nervous systems and the neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways, and especially including the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis (HPA axis). That term has been expanded to include the role of the gut flora as part of the \\"microbiome-gut-brain axis\\", a linkage of functions including the gut flora. Interest in the field was sparked by a 2004 study (Nobuyuki Sudo and Yoichi Chida) showing that germ-free mice (genetically homogeneous laboratory mice, birthed and raised in an antiseptic environment) showed an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress, compared to non-GF laboratory mice. The gut flora can produce a range of neuroactive molecules, such as acetylcholine, catecholamines, Œ≥-aminobutyric acid, histamine, melatonin, and serotonin, which are essential for regulating peristalsis and sensation in the gut. Changes in the composition of the gut flora due to diet, drugs, or disease correlate with changes in levels of circulating cytokines, some of which can affect brain function. The gut flora also release molecules that can directly activate the vagus nerve, which transmits information about the state of the intestines to the brain. Likewise, chronic or acutely stressful situations activate the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis, causing changes in the gut flora and intestinal epithelium, and possibly having systemic effects. Additionally, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, signaling through the vagus nerve, affects the gut epithelium and flora. Hunger and satiety are integrated in the brain, and the presence or absence of food in the gut and types of food present also affect the composition and activity of gut flora. That said, most of the work that has been done on the role of gut flora in the gut‚Äìbrain axis has been conducted in animals, including the highly artificial germ-free mice. As of 2016, studies with humans measuring changes to gut flora in response to stress, or measuring effects of various probiotics, have generally been small and cannot be generalized; whether changes to gut flora are a result of disease, a cause of disease, or both in any number of possible feedback loops in the gut‚Äìbrain axis, remains unclear. The history of ideas about a relationship between the gut and the mind dates from the nineteenth century. The concepts of dyspepsia and neurasthenia gastrica referred to the influence of the gut on human emotions and thoughts.Manon Mathias and Alison M. Moore (eds), Gut Feeling and Digestive Health in Nineteenth-Century Literature, History and Culture. New York: Palgrave, 2018. Alison M. Moore, Manon Mathias and J√∏rgen Valeur, Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease, Volume 30 (1), Special issue on the Gut‚ÄìBrain Axis in History and Culture, 2019  Research =Probiotics A 2016 systematic review of laboratory animal studies and preliminary human clinical trials using commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria found that certain species of the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera (i.e., B. longum, B. breve, B. infantis, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and L. casei) had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.  Anxiety and mood disorders  As of 2018 work on the relationship between gut flora and anxiety disorders and mood disorders, as well as attempts to influence that relationship using probiotics or prebiotics (called \\"psychobiotics\\"), was at an early stage, with insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about a causal role for gut flora changes in these conditions, or about the efficacy of any probiotic or prebiotic treatment. People with anxiety and mood disorders tend to have gastrointestinal problems; small studies have been conducted to compare the gut flora of people with major depressive disorder and healthy people, but those studies have had contradictory results. Much interest was generated in the potential role of gut flora in anxiety disorders, and more generally in the role of gut flora in the gut‚Äìbrain axis, by studies published in 2004 showing that germ-free mice have an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress caused by being restrained, which was reversed by colonizing their gut with a Bifidobacterium species. Studies looking at maternal separation for rats shows neonatal stress leads to long-term changes in the gut microbiota such as its diversity and composition, which also led to stress and anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, while much work had been done as of 2016 to characterize various neurotransmitters known to be involved in anxiety and mood disorders that gut flora can produce (for example, Escherichia, Bacillus, and Saccharomyces species can produce noradrenalin; Candida, Streptococcus, and Escherichia species can produce serotonin, etc.) the interrelationships and pathways by which the gut flora might affect anxiety in humans were unclear. In one study, germ-free mice underwent fecal transplants with microbes from humans with or without major depressive disorder (MDD). Mice with microbes from humans with MDD displayed more behaviors associated with anxiety and depression than mice transplanted with microbes from humans without MDD. The taxonomic composition of microbiota between depressed patients and healthy patients, as well as between the respective mice, also differed. Germ-free mice in another study also displayed behaviors associated with anxiety and depression as compared to mice with normal microbiota, and had higher levels of corticosterone after exposure to behavioral tests. Using rodents in microbiome and mental health studies allows researchers to compare behavior and microbial composition of rodents to humans, ideally to elucidate therapeutic application for mental disorders. Additionally, there is a link between the gut microbiome, mood disorders and anxiety, and sleep. The microbial composition of the gut microbiome changes depending on the time of day, meaning that throughout the day, the gut is exposed to varying metabolites produced by the microbes active during that time. These time-dependent microbial changes are associated with differences in the transcription of circadian clock genes involved in circadian rhythm. One mouse study showed that altering clock gene transcription by disrupting circadian rhythm, such as through sleep deprivation, potentially has a direct effect on the composition of the gut microbiome. Another study found that mice that could not produce the CLOCK protein, made by a clock gene, were more likely to develop depression. Stress and sleep disturbances can lead to greater gut mucosal permeability via activation of the HPA axis. This in turn causes immune inflammatory responses that contribute to the development of illnesses that cause depression and anxiety.  Autism  Around 70% of people with autism also have gastrointestinal problems, and autism is often diagnosed at the time that the gut flora becomes established, indicating that there may be a connection between autism and gut flora. Some studies have found differences in the gut flora of children with autism compared with children without autism ‚Äì most notably elevations in the amount of Clostridium in the stools of children with autism compared with the stools of the children without ‚Äì but these results have not been consistently replicated. Many of the environmental factors thought to be relevant to the development of autism would also affect the gut flora, leaving open the question of whether specific developments in the gut flora drive the development of autism or whether those developments happen concurrently. As of 2016, studies with probiotics had only been conducted with animals; studies of other dietary changes to treat autism have been inconclusive.  Parkinson's disease  As of 2015, one study had been conducted comparing the gut flora of people with Parkinson's disease to healthy controls; in that study people with Parkinson's had lower levels of Prevotellaceae and people with Parkinson's who had higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae had more clinically severe symptoms; the authors of the study drew no conclusions about whether gut flora changes were driving the disease or vice versa.

He served for more than 50 years at St Paul's Church in the town‚Äîfirst as a curate, then from 1873 as its vicar. As the only son of the Rev. Henry Michell Wagner (Vicar of Brighton for 46 years) and his wife Elizabeth Harriott, who died when he was a child, Arthur Wagner inherited considerable wealth. Following the pattern set by his father‚Äîwho founded several churches in Brighton‚Äîhe was able to pay for the construction and endowment of four churches in the town, three of which survive, and another in rural East Sussex where he owned a country estate. Like his father, he became embroiled in disputes and controversy: he held strongly Tractarian views and was often criticised for the advanced ritualism of the services he held at St Paul's, while his involvement in the Constance Kent affair caused national debate about priest‚Äìpenitent privilege. Wagner's influence in Victorian Brighton was considerable. \\"Not just a very rich clergyman of advanced religious beliefs\\", he was also greatly interested in church architecture and decoration. His wealth and his successful ministry at St Paul's allowed Wagner to found new churches in growing suburbs such as Hanover, Montpelier and the London Road/Lewes Road areas, which were notable both for their richly designed interiors and for their determinedly Tractarian tradition. The vast St Bartholomew's Church continues to serve a densely populated inner-city area; St Martin's Church, built shortly afterwards, is even larger and served a district partly developed by Wagner himself; the Church of the Annunciation combines a modest exterior with striking internal fittings; and he was involved with the design and fitting out of St Paul's Church, although his father paid for it. Arthur Wagner's influence was also seen in the \\"grandeur and artistry\\" of St Michael and All Angels Church, built for the ministry of one of his curates at St Paul's. Although his official status was never more than vicar of a single church, his influence was such that \\"he was acknowledged as virtual Bishop-coadjutant of Brighton\\". Early life and ordination Arthur Douglas Wagner was the only son of Henry Michell Wagner (1792‚Äì1870), Vicar of Brighton from 1824 until his death, and Elizabeth Harriott Douglas (1797‚Äì1829). They had met in 1820 and were married in 1823. Both had an ecclesiastical background: Henry Wagner's grandfather Henry Michell was Vicar of Brighton during the 18th century and was an influential figure when the town's fashionability was at its height, and Elizabeth Harriott's father William Douglas and grandfather John Douglas were respectively the Precentor of Salisbury Cathedral and the Bishop of Salisbury. Wagner's birthplace, Park Hill in Windsor, was owned by his mother's family. Born on 13 June 1824, he was named Arthur after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, whose son had been tutored by Henry Wagner from 1817 and who later appointed Wagner as Vicar of Brighton. His baptism took place at St Mary's Church in nearby Winkfield on 6 August 1824. The family's permanent residence from 1824, when Henry Michell Wagner became Vicar of Brighton, was the medieval vicarage in The Lanes. This was demolished and replaced by a new vicarage (still extant as part of Brighton and Hove High School, and now a Grade II listed building) in 1835. After Wagner's mother died in 1829, his grandmother Anne Elizabeth Wagner and maiden aunt Mary Ann Wagner moved into the vicarage and helped with his upbringing. He attended St Nicholas' parish church from an early age, and is believed to have gone to school for a time at an \\"academy for young gentlemen\\" in Montpelier Road, next to where the new vicarage was later built. He then attended Eton College for seven years from September 1835 and then studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge between 1842 and 1846. He graduated with an honours degree. \\"It [was] evident from the earliest days\\" that Wagner would follow his father into Anglican ministry. Henry Michell Wagner had already funded three new Anglican churches in Brighton when, in 1846, he engaged the Tractarian-influenced architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter to design and build a fourth specifically for Arthur Wagner‚Äîwho had already formed Tractarian views on ecclesiology and worship, particularly through the influence of Joshua Watson, his step- grandfather and a prominent High Churchman. St Paul's Church, centrally located on West Street close to long-established poor districts around the old town, was completed in 1848 and consecrated in October 1849. In January 1850, Wagner was ordained and became perpetual curate of the church, which was not yet parished because it was administered as a chapel of ease by St Nicholas' Church, Brighton's ancient parish church. Wagner's churches St Paul's Church, Brighton Although his father paid for its construction, St Paul's Church on West Street was effectively Arthur Wagner's first church: he ministered there from the start and paid for many of the fittings himself. Soon, he was looking to expand the Church of England's reach in poor areas of Brighton, just as his father had done, by finding sites for new churches and paying for them to be built. His first two churches were built while Henry Michell Wagner was still Vicar of Brighton, a position he held until his death in 1870. First to be established was the St Mary and St Mary Magdalene's Church (1862), a small and plain Gothic Revival building in \\"a poor quarter of the original town\\" (Bread Street, in the present North Laine district). It was a chapel of ease to St Paul's and was never consecrated. George Frederick Bodley, a Gothic Revival architect who lived in Brighton at the time, was responsible for the simple design, and Wagner paid for the ¬£2,500 cost himself. The area became depopulated in the mid-20th century as commercial development took over, and the church closed temporarily in the 1920s and permanently in 1948. After a period of use by the local electricity board, it was demolished in the mid-1960s to be replaced by an office building which severed the old street. Architecturally it was a \\"modest\\" building but \\"of distinction\\" because of its arched timber-framed roof and red-brick exterior. The Church of the Annunciation, built to serve the Hanover neighbourhood whose houses included many built with the help of loans from Wagner, was his next church. It opened in 1864 on the Feast of the Annunciation (15 August) and was a chapel of ease to St Paul's until a parish was allocated in 1881. Local architect William Dancy designed an Early English Gothic Revival building on an awkward, narrow and sloping site on Washington Street. It was similar on the outside to St Mary and St Mary Magdalene's Church. Wagner founded a temporary church dedicated to Saint Bartholomew in 1868 in the densely populated area between London Road and Brighton railway station. It stood on Providence Place next to a 400-capacity church school. After his father's death in 1870, Wagner made plans for a much larger permanent church on the site. Originally conceived as a 13-bay, by building with an integrated school, it was shortened to 11¬Ω bays before building began in February 1872 (and in the end only nine were built). The new plans (submitted in September 1873) provided for a shorter but wider and much taller church: . When it opened in September 1874, the new St Bartholomew's Church offered free seating for 1,500 worshippers‚Äîthe first church in Brighton to be free of pew rents from the date of opening. Despite its vast size (the nave is the largest in any British parish church), the church cost ¬£18,000‚Äîmuch less than St Peter's Church, built 50 years previously‚Äîbecause plain brickwork was used instead of the latter's Portland stone and certain planned features such as transepts were omitted. Much was spent on the ornate interior decoration, though. Although built just after Henry Michell Wagner's death, St Bartholomew's Church was not planned as a memorial to Arthur Wagner's father: that distinction went to St Martin's Church nearby on the Lewes Road in the Round Hill area of Brighton, also planned and built in the early 1870s. At the time of his death, Henry Michell Wagner was planning to found another Anglican church in Brighton and had set aside ¬£3,000 from his personal wealth, but had not decided on a location or any other details. Arthur Wagner and his half-brothers Joshua and Henry chose the site and agreed to fund the whole project themselves. The Round Hill area was being developed with high-density housing at this time, and the Wagner family planned to build the church on the west side of Lewes Road opposite the bottom of Elm Grove. The Church of the Transfiguration, soon afterwards renamed the Church of the Resurrection, was built in 1876‚Äì77 and was situated just from St Paul's Church on West Street. Wagner intended to attract the town's fishermen and other poor residents to the church, realising that they were \\"awed by the size and grandeur\\" of St Paul's and its congregation, which by this stage consisted of fashionable high-class visitors and wealthy residents. Construction was problematical because the owner of an adjacent brewery objected, forcing Wagner to change the plans and have it built underground. Richard Herbert Carpenter was the architect. The church opened in 1878 but was never successful: it was converted into a warehouse in 1912 and demolished in 1966. Community of the Blessed Virgin Mary The Community was housed at Wykeham Terrace, Brighton. Wagner founded a religious order in Brighton in 1855. Named the Community of the Blessed Virgin Mary, it was linked with St Paul's Church: the sisters helped to look after the building, visit parishioners and run the Sunday School. At first they were based in two houses on nearby Queen's Square. Around the same time, Wagner's cousin Rev. George Wagner‚Äîcurate of St Stephen's Church‚Äîhad established a \\"Home for Female Penitents\\" (prostitutes) on the Lewes Road. George Wagner died in 1857, at which point Arthur Wagner moved the home to Wykeham Terrace (adjacent to Queen's Square) and put the sisters in charge of rehabilitating the former prostitutes and taking in others who had been referred to the home by police officers or doctors. (Prostitution was a significant problem in mid-19th-century Brighton: more than 300 women and some children were known to work as prostitutes at that time, and there were nearly 100 brothels). Moving the home to Wykeham Terrace, where it took up nine of the twelve houses, allowed more than 40 women to be looked after, whereas the capacity at Lewes Road had been 12. Wagner and the sisters maintained a strict regime, with regular surveillance, hard work and punishments for misbehaviour, but the women were offered proper healthcare, education, training for domestic service, and charitable help. At a time when such assistance was limited, and provided only by private means, it was \\"probably the most effective single unit in the town\\". By the late 19th century, St Mary's Home for Penitents had outgrown the Wykeham Terrace buildings. Wagner's ill health meant no action could be taken to address this; but ten years after his death, a large new site was secured on the Falmer Road in Rottingdean and a much larger building designed by local architect F.T. Cawthorn was erected. It remained in use until the late 20th century. Short-lived stints as an old people's home, a school and a centre for the Church of Scientology ended in 1977, 1980 and 1984 respectively, at which point it was converted into flats called Rottingdean Place (opened in 1987). Constance Kent affair Constance Kent \\"The most famous incident of Arthur Wagner's life\\" concerned his involvement with the trial of Constance Kent, who committed one of Victorian England's most notorious murders. Kent was a 16-year-old girl who lived in Rode, Somerset with an extended family of siblings and half-siblings, her father and his second wife, and various housemaids and other household employees. Even before her birth mother died, Kent's stepmother Mary Drewe Pratt \\"acquired a dominant position in the household\\" and behaved disrespectfully towards her. Constance Kent's resentment built up until she reached a point where she wanted to take revenge to protect her mother's memory. Dismissing the idea of killing her, Kent instead decided to murder her stepmother's favourite child‚ÄîFrancis Savill Kent, who was 13 years younger than her. On 30 June 1860, she took the boy (then aged nearly four) from his bed, suffocated him and slit his throat, leaving his body in a privy outside the house. The local police had great difficulty establishing a motive or making any progress with the case, and even when Inspector Jonathan Whicher was called in from Scotland Yard no successful prosecution was achieved‚Äîalthough both Constance Kent and a governess were arrested, charged and released at various times.Full details of the Kent family and the murder are given at In 1861, Constance Kent entered a convent in Dinan in France after leaving a finishing school in the same town. Enjoying convent life but unable to stay at Dinan for ever, a mutual friend wrote to Arthur Wagner asking if he could accommodate her at St Mary's Home for Penitents as a paying guest. She moved there in August 1863. While living there she was confirmed and began to make confession regularly. Around Easter 1865, she confessed the murder of her half-brother to Arthur Wagner, described the circumstances and said she would give herself up to the police. News of Kent's confession became public soon afterwards, and Wagner faced public condemnation. It was claimed he encouraged Kent to confess, and that he convinced her to surrender to the police. He repeatedly denied this, although he stated that he did not discourage Kent from going to the police after she told him she would. At her insistence, Wagner spoke to the Home Secretary Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet and chief magistrate Sir Thomas Henry, to whom Kent gave a written confession. When the case was heard in May 1865, Wagner was cross-examined; his refusal to state what Constance Kent had said to him during her confession resulted in an \\"outburst of ultra-Protestant fury\\". Public disquiet at the use of Catholic-style ritual at St Paul's Church turned to national outrage when it was established that confession was heard. Physical and verbal attacks on Wagner occurred regularly, and Wagner's home and the St Mary's Home for Penitents were put under police guard. Anti- Catholic Liberal politician George Hammond Whalley falsely claimed in the House of Commons that Wagner had \\"got rid of\\" a young resident of St Mary's Home who had left money to the Home in her will‚Äîshe was in fact an inmate of a home elsewhere in Sussex, and Wagner had only met her briefly‚Äîand the Central Protestant Association (an anti-High Church organisation) called for the Mayor of Brighton to bring before Parliament a statement condemning the \\"base and degrading confessional practices carried on ... by traitors\\" within the Church of England. A meeting they held in Brighton descended into violence. Later in May 1865, Wagner was assaulted in the street; and on another occasion he was shot at by an unknown assailant but suffered no injury. Only after national newspapers such as The Times and The Morning Post ran articles condemning the ultra-Protestant disturbances in Brighton did the furor die down. Kent was found guilty of the murder in summer 1865. Her death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment; she served 20 years before being released. Wagner wrote to William Ewart Gladstone several times during her imprisonment asking for leniency to be shown and to try to secure her early release, but without success. He maintained regular communication with Kent throughout her term of imprisonment. Other work St Mary the Virgin's Church, Buxted Wagner had a lifelong concern for the lives of poor people in Brighton, and throughout his life he took practical steps to help them. During the 1860s he helped financially with the development of large parts of the Hanover neighbourhood, which was a densely populated area with much terraced housing. \\"One of his hidden charities\\" involved lending small amounts of money regularly to small- scale housebuilders who wanted to build these houses but could not afford large loans from conventional providers. In this way, large numbers of houses were built rapidly in streets such as Islingword Road and Whichelo Place. Similarly, he paid for the construction of much of the housing in the densely populated area between Upper Lewes Road and Lewes Road, developed between the 1860s and the 1880s and served by St Martin's Church. He was responsible for building about 400 houses in this area, none of which were to cost more than ¬£120. After his father Henry Michell Wagner's death, Arthur Wagner bought a small rural estate in East Sussex, and divided his time between Brighton and there. Totease House was situated on the edge of Buxted and was built in the early 19th century. St Margaret's Church at Buxted Park, the parish church of Buxted, was distant from the centre of the village and from the house, so Wagner paid for an additional church to be built. St Mary the Virgin's Church was built in 1885‚Äì87 and opened on 11 June 1887. The Gothic Revival design was the work of Edmund Scott (architect of St Bartholomew's Church) and F.T. Cawthorn. Nine years earlier, Wagner had built a house in the village to provide extra accommodation for the sisters of the Community of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in 1883 he built himself a new house with its own chapel which was shared with the Community's sisters. Both buildings survive, but the sisters' house passed into new ownership when they moved to their larger premises at Rottingdean in 1912. Personal life and views Arthur Wagner remained unmarried throughout his life. Two unmarried cousins looked after him for much of his life. His generally \\"simple\\" and \\"ascetic\\" lifestyle, which included lifelong fasting on Fridays, contrasted with his enthusiasm for collecting manuscripts and books, which totalled 12,000 by his death. Many of these were religious books, tracts and manuscripts, including valuable first editions, but he also collected histories, biographies, geographical and topographical books, and lithographs. No record survives of how much the sale of Wagner's library fetched, but such was the volume of works that the sale process took three days. His last years were characterised by ill health and failing mental faculties, but he resisted calls to resign from his parish. Prominent High Churchmen who were counted among Wagner's friends included John Keble and John Henry Newman, who converted to Roman Catholicism in 1845 and later became Cardinal Newman. Both Keble and Henry Edward Manning preached at St Paul's Church at Wagner's invitation. Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone worshipped at St Paul's Church whenever he was in Brighton and was \\"a slight acquaintance\\" of Wagner's. Wagner and fellow Tractarian Edward Bouverie Pusey had known each other since childhood and were close friends. Wagner had a lifelong opposition to the consecration of Anglican churches, on the basis that this would \\"[give] an opening for the State to intervene in their affairs\\". This view was shared by many Tractarians. On one occasion he complained to Richard Durnford, Bishop of Chichester, that consecration was \\"a farce\\". Pusey supported Wagner in his attempts to leave his newly built churches unconsecrated, but to no avail. Wagner was noted for his generosity as much as for his great wealth. It is estimated that he spent between ¬£60,000 and ¬£70,000 of his own money on new churches in Brighton alone, excluding the ongoing costs of maintaining them which he invariably bore himself. Until the 1880s, when they were granted their own parishes, all of his new churches were chapels of ease to St Paul's Church; Wagner paid for several curates to look after these churches. He also contributed hundreds of pounds annually to church schools and considerably more to the running of St Mary's Home for Penitents: it is known that he spent ¬£2,500 on it in 1865, for example. His housebuilding activities in Hanover and Round Hill cost at least ¬£40,000. Arthur Wagner's tolerant personality and aversion to quarrel contrasted with his father, who enjoyed challenging his opponents and asserting his authority. However, Henry Michell Wagner was much more tolerant of ecclesiastical differences and traditional structures of authority. For example, the elder Wagner maintained excellent relations with all five Bishops of Chichester who worked with him during his years as Vicar of Brighton; but Richard Durnford, the incumbent during most of Arthur Wagner's time at St Paul's Church, found him to be \\"a difficult man who liked his [own] way\\". Both Wagners, though, tended to generate controversy and opposition but stood \\"impervious\\" and \\"unmoved\\" against it. In Arthur Wagner's case, this ability to remain aloof to opposition was helped by his remote, introvert nature and aversion to publicity: he did little beyond his church work, his lifestyle was simple and austere, and was described by one friend as humourless. Death Wagner Hall next to St Paul's Church (left background) commemorates Arthur Wagner. Arthur Wagner died on 14 January 1902 at Belvedere, the home he had occupied since his father's death in 1870. It was next to the old Vicarage on Montpelier Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton. He was buried at Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery alongside his father, and is among many of \\"Victorian ... Brighton's great and good\\" to be buried there. The burial was attended by 3,000 people, and churches across Brighton held Requiems in his honour. He left an estate of nearly ¬£50,000 at 1902 prices; the money was endowed to the churches he founded and to the Community of the Blessed Virgin Mary. After Wagner's death, Belvedere was sold and became a hotel called the Park Royal Court Hotel. It was demolished in 1965, and the Park Royal flats now stand on the site. Wagner is commemorated by the Wagner Hall, built in 1965 as a new church hall for St Paul's Church. It stands next to the church on Regency Road on the site of a Baptist chapel.

Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices. The book is based upon Cochrane's doctoral thesis, which was completed at the London School of Economics, and builds upon subjects he had discussed in previous publications, including his first book. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics from a variety of backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found a middle ground between traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism. Background Animal Rights Without Liberation is based upon Cochrane's doctoral thesis, completed at the London School of Economics (LSE) under the supervision of C√©cile Fabre, with Paul Kelly acting as an advisor. The thesis was examined by Anne Phillips and Albert Weale, the former of whom suggested the title which was used for the book. The arguments in the book differ from the arguments in the thesis, however, and in preparing the manuscript for publication, Cochrane drew upon the advice of a number of academics, especially Robert Garner. In addition to presenting ideas used in the book at meetings of the Political Theory Group at LSE, Cochrane published an article entitled \\"Animal interests and animal experiments: An interest- based approach\\" in the journal Res Publica in 2006. This article won the journal's second annual Postgraduate Essay Prize, and formed the basis of the third chapter of Animal Rights Without Liberation. Cochrane continued to work on questions of animal rights after the completion of his doctorate, publishing articles on the subject in Utilitas and Political Studies in 2009, the latter of which provoked responses from Garner in 2011 and the philosopher John Hadley in 2013. Cochrane published his first book, An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, through Palgrave Macmillan in 2010, after having moved to the Department of Politics at Sheffield University. Animal Rights Without Liberation was published by Columbia University Press, as part of the series Critical Perspectives on Animals: Theory, Culture, Science, and Law. The series, edited by the legal scholar Gary Francione and the philosopher Gary Steiner, aims to give direction to the emerging interdisciplinary research in animal studies. Animal Rights Without Liberation was the second book published as a part of the series, after Francione and Garner's 2010 The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation? It was published in August 2012 in a variety of formats. The interest-based rights approach Cochrane's \\"interest-based rights approach\\" is the method utilised in the book to examine various ways in which animals are used by humans. Rights set limits on what can be done, even in the pursuit of aggregative well-being. The animal rights outlined by philosopher Tom Regan are based on the \\"inherent value\\" of individual animals (see intrinsic value). For Cochrane and other critics, this basis can seem \\"mysterious\\". Instead, Cochrane suggests that rights should be grounded in interests, and follows legal philosopher Joseph Raz's formulation that > 'X has a right' if and only if X can have rights and, other things being > equal, an aspect of X's well-being (his interest) is a sufficient reason for > holding some other person(s) to be under a duty. Cochrane draws out several aspects of this account, which serves as the basis of the analysis in Animal Rights Without Liberation. First, interests must be \\"sufficient to give grounds for holding another to be under a duty\\". Judging this entails considering the strength of an interest as well as \\"all other considerations\\"; so, for example, while individuals may have a very strong interest in free expression, but, \\"all things considered\\", this need not protect slander. The greater interest of the victim of slander can outweigh the interest in free expression, and so context is important. This is the difference between prima facie rights and concrete rights. The former exist on an abstract level outside of particular circumstances. Prima facie rights can translate into concrete rights when considered in particular situations but do not always, as the free expression example illustrates. The account is for moral rights, and Cochrane's normative claims are intended to form part of a \\"democratic underlaboring\\", informing and persuading political communities. The strength of an interest is determined by a consideration of the value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed. Synopsis=Methodology Animal Rights Without Liberation seeks to decouple animal rights from animal liberation. For Cochrane, of central importance is the question of sentience, understood as \\"the capacity for phenomenal consciousness\\". No position is taken on precisely how many animals are sentient, but, Cochrane argues, it is clear that at least some nonhuman animals are. Sentience alone does not afford moral status, but sentience implies the capacity for well-being; sentient beings have lives that can go better or worse for them. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that personhood is required for moral value, but Cochrane observes that there may be nonhuman animals who could be considered persons. In any case, it is argued that there are good reasons not to agree with Kant, and Cochrane concludes that there is no reason to limit the possession of moral status to humans. What needs to be considered is not whether anything is owed to animals, but what is owed to them. Following a paper on animal rights by political philosopher Joel Feinberg, Cochrane suggests that animals possess rights on account of their interests. Cochrane then deals with four possible objections. Interest rights are defended against the claim that moral agency is a prerequisite of rights-possession, against the demand that rights be derived from social relations, against the suggestion, from R. G. Frey, that animals do not possess interests, and against the idea that inanimate entities and plants may possess interests. At this point, Cochrane has completed the first two steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating the details of his interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic. Application Cochrane argues that while animals have no right against being used in painless experiments, they do have a right not to be killed or made to suffer in experiments. Having outlined his methodological approach, Cochrane goes on to apply his theory to a number of ways that animals are used by society. First, Cochrane considers animal experimentation, arguing that \\"animal experiments that result in pain or death are morally illegitimate, while painless experiments in which the animal does not die are permissible, all else being equal.\\" Cochrane discusses how to judge the strength of an interest, and then considers the strength of animals' interests in not being subjected to painful experimentation. He considers three reasons the interest may not be sufficient to ground a right, and rejects them all; that the benefits of animal testing outweigh the suffering, that humans owe more to members of their own species than to members of others (see speciesism) and that human lives are objectively more valuable than the lives of other animals. Cochrane concludes that animals have a concrete right to not be subjected to painful experiments. He next considers animals' interests in not being killed, concluding that they \\"have an interest in continued life so that they may have more pleasant experiences and greater overall well-being in their lives\\", but that this interest is weaker than the corresponding interest possessed by human persons. If deadly experimentation on nonhuman non-persons is permitted, then consistency demands that it also be permitted on human non- persons, such as babies or individuals with certain cognitive disabilities. Like most others, Cochrane is unwilling to allow this possibility, and so claims that animals have a right not to be used in deadly experiments. However, he argues that animals have neither an interest in negative or positive freedom, and, like animals, human non-persons also lack this interest; therefore, neither have a prima facie right not to be used, provided said use respects the rights they do possess. The second considered application is animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights not to be made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist were it not for the human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest. After looking at agriculture, Cochrane considers the relationship between animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right not to have been engineered, arguing that it is not the case that they always do, and that if \\"genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible.\\" Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest \\"in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well- being\\", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities. Cochrane condemns current practices in horse racing. He notes that the UK industry spends only ¬£250,000 a year caring for retired animals, a sum he calls \\"pathetic\\", given the horses' interest in life and avoiding suffering and the profits the industry commands. Chapter six addresses the use of animals in entertainment. Cochrane does not oppose the practice of pet-keeping, and accepts that humans do have an interest in being able to keep pets, but that this interest is not so strong that it can be satisfied at any cost. He argues that pet-keeping should be regulated far more than it is, perhaps through the need for a license, the granting of which would be dependent on individuals proving their ability to care for the animal's well-being. Cochrane is open to euthanizing pets, but only in cases when medical care could not give them a chance at further good experiences. In these cases, providing medical care would be necessary (pet insurance could be a requirement for a license). Neutering pets is argued to be neither a violation of their rights nor a requirement, but anyone who does not have their pets neutered would be required to ensure the wellbeing of any offspring. The same requirements as were established in the chapter on genetic engineering are applied to animal breeding, and Cochrane accepts that this may lead to the extinction of certain breeds. Concerning zoos and circuses, Cochrane argues that animals do not possess a right not to be kept or displayed, but they do possess a right not to be made to suffer. This imposes limitations on the kinds of animals which can be kept (for instance, large animals could not realistically be kept by traveling circuses), the conditions in which they are kept, and the nature of their performances. Hunting, cockfighting, dogfighting, bear baiting and bullfighting are condemned, as is, after some consideration, fishing. Cochrane is potentially open to greyhound and horse racing, or equestrianism generally, but says that \\"the way that these sports are currently organized and practiced does involve the routine suffering and death of animals and ought to be condemned as such.\\" Such practices include suffering caused during training and racing, and the killing of animals past their peak or who do not display the requisite skills. Before concluding the chapter, Cochrane considers, but rejects, three possible objections to any use of animals in entertainment: first, by appeal to a concept of dignity, which use of the animals undermines; second, an appeal to disrespect, whether or not harm is caused; and third, that the use of animals in entertainment implies ownership, and animals have a right not to be considered property. Cochrane argues that a human interest in culture cannot outweigh animal interests in not suffering or being killed, using jallikattu (pictured) as an example practice which cannot be justified. In chapter seven, Cochrane approaches issues relating to animals and the environment. He first argues for the importance of this kind of analysis, before saying that, under the interest-based rights approach, non-conscious entities (including species, ecosystems and plants) cannot be understood to have rights; he then defends the necessity of consciousness for the possession of interests. Cochrane considers, but rejects, the land ethic of Aldo Leopold as a basis for the moral status of the environment, but instead defends the environment on welfare grounds. Though he rejects the notion that wild animals might own the land on which they live, Cochrane concludes that we have strict environmental obligations due to the rights and interests of sentient animals. Concerning endangered species, Cochrane rejects the notion of \\"superkilling\\" (that a special wrong is involved in wiping out a species) and the idea of \\"compensatory justice\\" (that more is owed to members of endangered species as a form of compensation). Instead, Cochrane argues that unconscious species may have contingent value, and members of rare conscious species may have a stronger right to life due to the interests of humans who will want to see them and the interests of other animals in their ecosystems. Cochrane then argues that animals possess a concrete right not to be killed in order to preserve a favoured ecosystem, whether because of overpopulation of the species or because species are nonnative. However, control by contraception is argued to be acceptable. In the final chapter on the application of the interest-based rights approach, Cochrane analyses the use of animals in cultural practices, considering the importance of culture, religion and a concern about hypocrisy. Cochrane first looks at the possibility that humans have an interest in culture which outweighs certain interests of animals. He argues that it cannot be the case that culture can always outweigh other rights. He then argues the human interest culture cannot outweigh animal interests in not suffering, using jallikattu as his example, or outweigh animal interests in not being killed, even if this entails the destruction of cultures \\"defined entirely by the grave harm [they cause] to animals\\". The human interest in freedom of religion, Cochrane claims, will usually not require the violation of animal interests, but cites Santeria as a possible exception to this. Cochrane argues against the possibility that freedom of religion is a special interest and should always merit priority, and the idea that equal opportunity should entail religious freedom to harm animals. Finally, Cochrane considers hypocrisy; given that animals are harmed in many practices, there may be a problem in disallowing certain religious practices. However, this does not make the religious practices more permissible, and seems to presuppose that these other practices will not themselves face censure. Conclusion The aim of Animal Rights Without Liberation was to \\"decouple animal rights and animal liberation\\". Cochrane claims that not only is an alternative to the Regan/Singer dichotomy possible, but it is preferable. He argues that, though his theory would allow the use and ownership of animals in certain circumstances, the theory would nonetheless have \\"incredibly radical\\" consequences if applied. The book has aimed to persuade people of the importance of animal rights, and thus serve as \\"democratic underlabouring\\". This democratic underlabouring, Cochrane claims, is essential for the legitimacy of animal rights. Relatedly, Cochrane firmly rejects violent interventions on behalf of animals as counterproductive, immoral and illegitimate. Reviews Animal Rights Without Liberation was reviewed by the philosophers Corinne Painter, Rainer Ebert and Eva Meijer for the Radical Philosophy Review, the Journal of Animal Ethics and Animals & Society respectively, while the sociologists Mark Suchyta and Lu√≠s Cordeiro Rodrigues reviewed the book for Between the Species and the Marx & Philosophy Review of Books respectively. The political historian Will Boisseau reviewed the work in the Political Studies Review, and other reviews were written by Hadley, published on the Global Policy website, the founder of Animal People Merritt Clifton for the Animal People website, and an unnamed reviewer for Internet Bookwatch. Hadley found the most important contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be the application of a Razian framework of rights to animals, adding that \\"assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously, there is little to take issue with in Cochrane's analysis\\". However, for Hadley, there is a fundamental tension in Cochrane's theory, as there is in most animal rights literature. In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom, Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights. For Hadley, \\"only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all, like Bentham's, are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain. The rest, arguably, are more or less disguised versions of the person-centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross-species equality.\\" Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane's overall argument, writing that it \\"ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights. [Cochrane's] reasoning, assuming you accept animals matter at all, is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible.\\" Hadley closed his review by considering the book's middle ground between traditional rights theory and utilitarianism, writing that, for Cochrane > in line with orthodox animal rights theory, animals are owed some utility- > trumping rights‚Äîa right not to suffer and a right not to be killed; but, in > line with utilitarianism, [Cochrane] wants to promote well-being without > giving animals a right to liberty in the sense of outright protection from > ownership and use by humans. Cochrane thus successfully ‚Äòdecouples‚Äô the > rights-utilitarian dichotomy and locates his theory in the middle ground > between the two. You might say he gives with one hand while taking away with > the other. Clifton and Ebert, too, focussed on Cochrane's attempt to find and conceptualise a middle ground between the work of Regan (who advocates animal rights) and Singer (who advocates animal welfare from a utilitarian perspective), and Meijer praised it for identifying a conceptual space between animal rights and animal liberation. Clifton suggested that Cochrane's thought is actually closer to Regan's. Boisseau, though, suggested that, given that Cochrane allows some use of animals in entertainment and genetic engineering, the arguments of Animal Rights Without Liberation may come across as \\"radically permissive\\" when compared with those of other animal rights positions. The permissibility of some forms of animal experimentation under Cochrane's account \\"may shock\\" supporters of approaches based upon Regan's philosophy. Ebert concluded that \\"the great accomplishment of Cochrane's book is to show that there is a coherent, intuitively plausible, and useful notion of animal rights that is firmly rooted in the tangible and avoids the unattractive absolutism of Regan-style rights views\\". Meijer felt that the book is strong on the application of Cochrane's account, but she expressed concern about Cochrane's rejection of liberty rights for animals, which, she noted, most approaches to animal rights allow. Cochrane's deploys, she noted, a narrow account of animal agency; \\"it is\\", she argued, \\"problematic to view humans as autonomous agents and other animals as nonautonomous others\\". Cochrane's view of animals as non-autonomous, she argued, is emphasised by the absence of an account of relationships and communication between humans and animals. Ebert felt that the \\"rather disconcerting\\" element of Cochrane's thought concerning nonautonomous humans was dealt with too quickly in the book, saying that \\"controversy would be certain if infants or the seriously mentally disabled were regarded as property or put up for display in human zoos, regardless of how well they were taken care of. If we believe that human nonpersons have a right not to be treated in such a degrading manner, then so do nonhuman animal nonpersons.\\" Boisseau, too, found the aspect of Cochrane's thought dealing with \\"people with mental disabilities\\" to be \\"objectionable\\". Clifton approvingly quoted the arguments in Animal Rights Without Liberation concerning animals killed in crop harvest, and observed that, other than a hypothetical openness towards ethically produced eggs and dairy, Cochrane's arguments would seem to favour veganism over vegetarianism. Clifton also showed interest in Cochrane's arguments concerned pet-keeping, writing \\"Cochrane never mentions pit bulls, but his argument is in effect a case for prohibiting pit bull breeding: pit bulls have never been more than 5% of the U.S. dog population, but are 20% of the dogs impounded in cruelty and neglect cases.\\" Boisseau worried that animal activists may find the imprecise positions of \\"animal rights\\" or \\"animal liberation\\" more useful than Cochrane's comparatively nuanced position, and questioned the extent to which political and legal change could be possible given continued use of animals. The book was summarised in Internet Bookwatch as \\"[p]ragmatic, insightful, rational, iconoclastic, informed and informative\\". It was described as \\"thoughtful and thought-provoking, making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists.\\" In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working in the area of animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that \\"It would be an understatement to say that I disagree with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion.\\" Legacy In a quote used by Columbia University Press, Garner praised Animal Rights Without Liberation for being the first sustained attempt to use an interest-based theory of rights for animals, and the first to use such a theory to challenge animals' right to liberty. In his 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals, Garner challenges Cochrane on his use of the argument from marginal cases. If animals are assumed to have an equal interest in life as typical humans because marginal humans are, then one could also assume animals to have an equal interest in liberty, because of the assumption of marginal humans' interest in liberty. Cochrane, however, denies that marginal humans are assumed to have a strong interest in liberty. The first part of the argument, Garner observes, assumes that marginal humans are considered to have an equal interest in (or an equal right to) life; this is a claim which Garner challenges, reaching what he considers a more nuanced position than Cochrane's. Nonetheless, the ideal theory which Garner endorses‚Äîthe enhanced sentience position‚Äîis close to Cochrane's interest-based rights position. Garner himself identifies differences between his thought and Cochrane's in their respective use of the argument from marginal cases and the fact that Garner offers a nonideal theory, while Cochrane does not. Garner also questions the extent to which Cochrane is right that his reliance on interest rights is new, suggesting that Feinberg, James Rachels and Steve Sapontzis all used the language of interest rights. Garner adds that \\"what Cochrane does, unlike Sapontzis, is to draw what I think are the correct conclusions from the adoption of an interest- based theory of animal rights\\". Garner has also criticised Cochrane's rejection of liberty rights for animals; others to challenge this include Hadley and the philosophers Andreas T. Schmidt, Val√©ry Giroux, and Jason Wyckoff. Cochrane has developed his account in subsequent work, tying his work to cosmopolitan theory in a 2013 paper and developing an account of labour rights for animals in a 2016 paper. As of 2016, Cochrane is working on a book on the topic of animal rights and global justice, covering questions of cross- border obligations to nonhuman animals and the idea of international politics taking the rights of all sentient beings seriously. The book is intended for 2017 or 2018 release. A number of subsequent thinkers have deployed interest- based rights for animals, drawing upon Cochrane's work. Tony Milligan characterises the use of interest-based rights as a close-to-defining feature of the literature exploring the intersections of political theory and animal ethics; this literature has been variously referred to as the \\"political turn\\" in animal rights/animal ethics, \\"Animal Politics\\" and \\"animal political theory\\". Cochrane's work, especially Animal Rights Without Liberation, has been repeatedly identified as central to and paradigmatic of this literature. Formats *Paperback: Cochrane, Alasdair (2012).

He died a prisoner in a galley, unable to pay his ransom, and was succeeded by his nephew, Pregent de La Fin. Family Jean de Ferri√®res, Vidame de Chartres, was the grandson of Jean de Ferri√®res (died 1497), who had been twice married, firstly to Marguerite de Bourbon (d. before February 1482), illegitimate daughter of John II, Duke of Bourbon (d. April 1488), by whom he had two sons who died without issue, and secondly to Marie de Damas, Dame de Maligny, by whom he had an elder son, Philippe de Ferri√®res, who inherited the Ferri√®res lands, and a younger son, Fran√ßois de Ferri√®res (died 1544), who inherited the Maligny lands, and in 1516Because of the opposition to the marriage of Louise's brother, the marriage contract was not signed until 12 September 1519; . married Louise de Vend√¥me (d. by 1553), despite the strong opposition of her brother, Louis de Vend√¥me (d. 22 August 1526). Fran√ßois de Ferri√®res (died 1544) who was chamberlain to Charles, Duke of Bourbon, and Louise de Vend√¥me, who was maid of honour to Anne de Beaujeu, Duchess of Bourbon, had two sons and five daughters: *Jean de Ferri√®res (1520‚Äì1586), the subject of this article. *Edme de Maligny (1540‚Äì1586), known as 'le jeune Maligny', who participated in the Amboise conspiracy, and drowned at Geneva in 1560. *Beraude de Maligny (d. 3 September 1618), Maid of Honour to Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre, who married firstly Dieudonne de Barratz or Bascaz (d. 6 June 1553), Seigneur de Bedeuil, and secondly, on 17 April 1559, Jean de La Fin (died 1599), Seigneur de Beauvoir-la-Nocle, by whom she was the mother of Pregent de La Fin (d.

Early career Ch√¢teau de la Fert√© Vidame, before 1750 In February 1538 Jean de Ferri√®res was given two benefices by his father. Less than two years later, however, he was disinherited by both his father and mother when they made their joint last wills on 23 December 1539. Although the reason for his disinheritance is unknown, d'Estang suggests that it may have been due to his abandonment of the Catholic religion. In November 1549 he travelled to Rome in the suite of Henri II's ambassador in ordinary, Claude d'Urf√© (d. 12 November 1558) for the papal conclave of 1549 to 1550 after the death of Pope Paul III.Claude d‚ÄôUrf√© (29 fev. 1501 ‚Äì 12 nov. 1558), La Bastie d‚ÄôUrf√© en Forez Retrieved 14 November 2013. In 1553 he accompanied his first cousin, Fran√ßois de Vend√¥me, Vidame de Chartres (d. 22 December 1560), the then Vidame de Chartres, to Metz, which was under siege by the English. In 1557 he travelled to Piedmont. In 1560 de Ferri√®res' cousin Fran√ßois was imprisoned in the Bastille after having fallen out with the powerful Guise family. He died on 22 December 1560 without legitimate issue, and despite the fact that Ferri√®res was his heir, did not mention him in his will. Petigny suggests that this might have been an act of prudence on Vend√¥me's part, considering the enemies he had made and the circumstances of his imprisonment. Ferri√®res inherited from his cousin both 'immense riches' and the title of Vidame de Chartres (formerly bishops including those of Reims, Amiens, Mans, Laon and Chartres had a vidame as his principal lay officer, but by the 16th century the title had become merely hereditary). According to Arber, because of concerns about what steps his enemies might take if he were to administer his inheritance himself, Ferri√®res made a secret agreement with his sister Beraude, that she would present herself as Vend√¥me's sole heir. Peace of Amboise, 1563 When civil war broke out in France over religious issues, the Protestant leader, Louis, Prince de Cond√©, sent Ferri√®res and the Seigneurs de Saint Aubin and de la Haye to England to persuade Elizabeth I to join the Huguenot resistance to the Catholic party. The French ambassadors arrived in England about 15 August 1562, and after numerous secret conferences with English officials, signed the Treaty of Hampton Court on 20 September 1562. An extant copy of the treaty bears Ferri√®res' signature. It was at this time that Richard Eden joined Ferri√®res' service as a secretary, according to Arber because he was an 'excellent linguist'. Ferri√®res, Eden, and 3000 English soldiers under the command of Sir Adrian Poynings sailed from Portsmouth on 2 October, arriving at Le Havre, then called by the English Newhaven, two days later. On 11 November a warrant authorized that a pension of ¬£300 be paid to Ferri√®res in quarterly instalments. By 29 July 1563 a large part of the English force at Le Havre had been slain in action or had died of the plague, forcing the surrender of the town to the French. The survivors returned to England, bringing the plague with them. The French civil war came to a temporary end on 19 March 1563 with the Edict of Pacification signed at Amboise, which granted the Huguenots certain religious freedoms. However Ferri√®res' goods were confiscated by the French crown on the ground of his responsibility for bringing English forces to Le Havre. From 23 March 1564 Charles IX of France, his mother, Catherine de' Medici, and the rest of French court were at Troyes, where Ferri√®res and the Prince de Cond√© joined them on 8 April, receiving a 'simulated welcome'. Ferri√®res left the royal progress at Vitry on 27 April, and joined the Prince de Cond√© in Paris, where he apparently resided for the next several years. Richard Eden's own account states that he travelled to various places in Germany, including Strasbourg, and according to Arber it is likely that Eden accompanied Ferri√®res on those journeys. In 1567 Ferri√®res recommended to Sir William Cecil a Frenchman, Pierre Briet, and a Fleming, Jean Carre, who wrote to Cecil on 9 August 1567 requesting permission to 'erect glassworks similar to those of Venice'. The religious wars broke out again with a Huguenot rising on 27 September 1567, when the entire French court narrowly escaped capture. The Battle of Saint Denis followed on 10 November. On 23 March 1568 the wars again came to a temporary end with the signing of the Pacification of Longjumeau. De Ferri√®res' associate in the French Wars of Religion, the Prince de Cond√© After the Prince de Cond√© was slain at the Battle of Jarnac on 13 March 1569, Ferri√®res and his wife, Fran√ßoise Joubert, left France, arriving in Cornwall on 28 April 1569. Ferri√®res was received by the Queen at Greenwich Palace on 8 July. On 23 September of that year, by decree of the French Parliament, he was burnt in effigy, for the second time within a year, at the Place de Gr√®ve in Paris. On 4 November 1569 Ferri√®res wrote from Holborn in London to Cecil recommending Giovanni Battista Agnello as 'a man of honest and industry'. With his letter he sent Cecil a copy of Agnello's book, saying that he wished it had been printed on cleaner paper, 'but that of dusky hue best suits the works of Vulcanicorum hominum'.'Elizabeth: November 1569', Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth, Volume 9: 1569‚Äì1571 (1874), pp. 140‚Äì147 Retrieved 9 November 2013. The book which de Ferri√®res enclosed with his letter was Agnello's Espositione di Giouanbatista Agnello Venetiano sopra vn libro intitolato Apocalypsis spiritus secreti,Espositione di Giouanbatista Agnello Venetiano sopra vn libro intitolato Apocalypsis spiritus secreti Retrieved 11 November 2013. published in London in 1566 as only the second book in Italian printed in England. The original work was an eight-page book in Latin, which Agnello had translated into Italian and elaborated with his own commentary. According to Linden, Agnello's purpose in the work was to explain the world soul in alchemical terms. Agnello's connection to Ferri√®res is not known, nor why he chose to recommend him to Cecil. On 24 January 1570, Elizabeth I wrote to her farmers of customs duties, advising that permission had been granted to Ferri√®res to import wine into England free of duty for his personal use. In October 1570, as a result of the Peace of Saint Germain, Ferri√®res was able to return to Paris. After some of his servants were attacked there, he went to Boubige in Poitou. In February 1572 he was at La Fert√©, but shortly thereafter returned to Paris, where he remained in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, mistrusting the King's promises for the safety of the Huguenots. After an attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, Ferri√®res took the King to task for the 'cowardice' of the attack, and the following day urged that the Admiral, and all Protestants, should leave Paris. His advice was ignored, and the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre occurred that night. Ferri√®res, his brother-in-law, Jean de La Fin, and ten others, including according to Arber, Richard Eden, escaped, fleeing first to La Fert√©, and from thence to the coast where they found a ship to take them to England. Ferri√®res arrived in London on 7 September 1573. In July 1573 Elizabeth I had already authorized a further warrant, similar to that which had been issued on 11 November 1562, granting payment of ¬£300 quarterly to Ferri√®res. Richard Eden had remained in Ferri√®res' service until 1572, travelling extensively with him in France and Germany. In September 1573 Ferri√®res wrote to the Queen requesting that Eden be admitted as one of her Poor Knights of Windsor. Ferri√®res returned to France, and in 1581, by then heavily in debt, joined the King of Navarre, the future Henri IV of France, in Gascony, and was named by him commander of Casteljaloux, an office which he fulfilled until January 1584. He then went to Saintonge, and despite his age engaged in conflict there between Protestant and Catholic forces. The galleys of a certain Captain Carles were making frequent sorties against the Ile d'Ol√©ron, in the course of which battles Ferri√®res was captured in 1586 by Catholic forces and handed over to Carles, who demanded a heavy ransom which Ferri√®res was unable to pay. In consequence Carles allowed Ferri√®res, at the age of about sixty-six, 'to die like a dog while bound to the magazine at the bottom of the hold of the captain's galley'.

Due to the activities of these clans, Galicia is often cited as being the main European entry point for Colombian cocaine. Activities Traditionally the region of Galicia made its money from the fishing industry, to which the coastal geography of the region lent itself. Following the crippling of the fishing industry, local fishermen began smuggling tobacco to keep their business alive. The successfulness of these tobacco smuggling activities led to the creation of clan-based groups who made their entire living off smuggling. Galician smuggling networks nowadays not solely concentrate on tobacco. It was when local criminal clans began making contacts in Colombia and Morocco that the illegal smuggling business began to thrive. Using their Colombian and Moroccan contacts, Galician organized crime groups traffic cocaine and hashish, aside from illegal tobacco, into the Spanish mainland. From Galicia it is distributed to major cities in Spain via other Galician contacts or via criminal groups consisting of Colombian expatriates. Drugs are frequently trafficked to the neighbouring regions of Portugal as well. Aside from Portugal, British Firms have set up contacts in Galicia, often working together with Galician criminal clans to bring in narcotics which the British gangs in turn smuggle into and distribute in the United Kingdom. Currently some clans are importing and distributing heroin, and have done business with the Albanian and Turkish mafias.Galicia revive la pesadilla del narco. El Pa√≠s, 4 JUN 2016. Criminal clans in the region have frequently been hostile to each other in recent years. While the Galician smuggling business in the beginning was very local, the internationalization of the organized criminal activities have led to crime-related clan feuds where murder, kidnapping and torture is occasionally committed by criminal Galician clan-members or Colombian contacts and contract killers. Some clans have or had a very violent conduct. One of the most famous acts of violence related to the illegal drug trade was the massacre of \\"O Hostal da R√≠a\\", in Vilanova de Arousa on 26 January 1997, where a drug dealer killed five people to avoid having witnesses of his involvement in heroin trafficking.Muerte y dogras en la R√≠a.

The character was originally conceived as a female counterpart to Captain Marvel. Like Captain Marvel, most of the bearers of the Ms. Marvel title gain their powers through Kree technology or genetics. Marvel has published four ongoing comic series titled Ms. Marvel, with the first two starring Carol Danvers and the third and fourth starring Kamala Khan.  Carol Danvers  Carol Danvers, the first character to use the moniker Ms. Marvel, first appeared in Marvel Super-Heroes #13 (March 1968) by writer Roy Thomas and artist Gene Colan as a non-superpowered officer in the United States Air Force. After being caught in an explosion with the Kree superhero Captain Marvel in Captain Marvel #18 (November 1969), Danvers resurfaces in Ms. Marvel #1 (January 1977) with super powers as result of the explosion which caused her DNA to merge with Captain Marvel's. As Ms. Marvel, Danvers becomes a mainstay of the superhero team The Avengers, beginning in The Avengers #171 (May 1978). Danvers goes on to use the codenames BinaryUncanny X-Men #164 (December 1982) and Warbird.Avengers vol. 3 #4 (May 1998) In July 2012, Danvers assumes the mantle Captain Marvel in honor of its dead, original holder, Mar-Vell, after Captain America tells her that Mar-Vell would want her to have it.  Sharon Ventura  Sharon Ventura, the second character to use the pseudonym Ms. Marvel, first appeared in The Thing #27 (September 1985), by Mike Carlin and Ron Wilson, as a stunt performer with the Thunderiders, where she met The Thing. In The Thing #35 (May 1986), Ventura volunteered for Power Broker's experiment to receive superpowers in order to join the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation with The Thing, taking the name Ms. Marvel. Ventura later joins the Fantastic Four herself in Fantastic Four #307 (October 1987) and, after being hit by cosmic rays in Fantastic Four #310 (January 1988), Ventura's body mutates into a similar appearance to that of The Thing and receives the nickname She-Thing.  Karla Sofen  Dr. Karla Sofen, the supervillain known as Moonstone, first appeared as the gun moll of Doctor Faustus, in Captain America #192 (December 1975) by Marv Wolfman and Frank Robbins. In The Incredible Hulk #228 (October 1978), Sofen becomes the psychiatrist of the villain Moonstone, also known as Lloyd Bloch. Sofen tricks Bloch into giving her the meteorite that empowers him, and she adopts both the name and abilities of Moonstone. During the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline, Sofen joins Norman Osborn's group of Avengers, known as the Dark Avengers, as the doppelganger of the previous Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers, receiving a costume similar to Danvers' original (Danvers wore the Warbird costume at the time).Dark Avengers #1 (January 2009) Sofen becomes the title character of the Ms. Marvel series beginning in issue #38 (June 2009) until Danvers takes the title back in issue #47 (January 2010).  Kamala Khan  Kamala Khan, created by Sana Amanat, G. Willow Wilson, and Adrian Alphona, is the fourth character to take the name Ms. Marvel. Khan first appeared in Captain Marvel #17 (November 2013) and is a 16-year-old Pakistani-American from Jersey City, New Jersey, who idolizes Carol Danvers. Khan was given her own Ms. Marvel series, which premiered in February 2014, becoming Marvel Comics' first Muslim character to headline her own comic book. The first collected volume of this series, Ms. Marvel Volume 1: No Normal, won the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.

She competed in numerous events throughout her career, including racing the Mille Miglia five times. In 1921, she famously drove a twelve-cylinder Packard 299 on the beach of the island of Fan√∏, in Denmark. She married her husband Baron Eustachio Avanzo in 1908 with whom she had two children, Luisa in 1909 and Renzo in 1911. In her career she fought for the right to compete as a woman, and became an activist for equality for women and a symbol of early feminism. Early life Maria Antonietta Avanzo (n√©e Bellan) was born in 1889 at Contarina, now Porto Viro, near Rovigo and learned to drive on her father's De Dion-Bouton tricycle. Before the Great War she married Baron Eustachio Avanzo, with whom she later had two children, and they moved to Rome. Both her father and her husband encouraged her driving talents, and Eustachio bought her a 35 hp SPA sportscar to race. In 1920 she began her racing career at the wheel of the SPA 35/50 in the Giro del Lazio. Career The first big race of Avanzo's career was the 1920 Giro del Lazio. She won her class, despite having to replace an errant wheel during the event. In 1920, she entered the Targa Florio in a Buick, but she did not finish and had to retire during her third lap. 1921 was an eventful year for Avanzo. She won the women's cup at the Brescia \\"Motor Sport Week\\", and in July she was driving a twelve-cylinder Packard which she took to a sand race meeting on the beaches of the island of Fan√∏, in Denmark, when the car caught fire while travelling at full speed, and she had to drive it into the sea to quench the flames. A young Enzo Ferrari was very impressed with her. According to Ferrari, as she emerged, Antonio Ascari overheard her remark that she'd be happy to swap it for a Fiat. On her return home she found a bright red Fiat awaiting her, and Ascari got the Packard which was repaired and put back into use. 1921, driving an Ansaldo 4CS she was Tazio Nuvolari's teammate and came in 7th (3rd in class) at the Circuito di Garda. Avanzo then emigrated to Australia, setting up a farming business there. She returned to Europe in 1926. In the 1930s she drove Alfa Romeos, Maseratis, and Bugattis on racetracks, in the Rocca di Papa hill climb, in the Mille Miglia, at Le Mans, at Indianapolis in a Miller in 1932, and even in the Tobruk-Tripoli in 1940. She had numerous rivals: Jole Venturi (OM), Corinna Braccialini (Alfa 1500), Anna Maria Peduzzi, and Dorina Colonna. She took part in the Mille Miglia race at least five times. Her first attempt at the Mille Miglia was in 1928, driving a Chrysler Tipo 72 with Manuel de Teff√©. They did not finish after a mechanical failure. The following year, she and Carlo Bruno retired early on, driving an Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 SS. After a break in 1930, she made another attempt at the Mille Miglia, in a Bugatti T43, driving with Count Carlo Castelbarco, and her final attempt was in 1932. She came in 6th at the Tobruk- Tripoli competition 1939. and her last recorded race was the 1939 Tobruk- Tripoli race, driving a Fiat. She was sixth in the 1100cc class, ahead of the other Italian female competitor, Lia Comirato Dumas. In 1940 she signed up entrant for the Mille Miglia, driving a Fiat 1100 with Angelo Della Cella, but did not start the race. Avanzo then retired.

She previously taught at Lady Shri Ram College and the Department of Political Science at Delhi University. She is known for strong positions on several political issues, including nuclear power and the Kashmir conflict. Scholarly career Menon is a feminist scholar who has taught at the International Studies School of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi since 2009. Before moving to JNU she was a teacher at Lady Shri Ram College for 15 years, and the political science department at Delhi University for seven years. Menon says that the Indian feminist movement she was exposed to in college, as well as the writings of global feminists, helped her evolve a better consciousness with respect to issues of sexuality and politics. She was greatly influenced by the work of global feminists like Betty Friednan, Germaine Greer and Gloria Steinem. Menon has written or edited several books about feminism and politics, including the 2004 volume Recovering Subversion: Feminist Politics Beyond the Law. She also writes on current issues in the journal Economic and Political Weekly, the online news blog kafila.org, and several newspapers. Reception Seeing Like a Feminist, released in 2012, received favourable reviews. It also had high sales, partly due to uproar following the 2012 Delhi gang rape. The title of the book is a play upon the title of Seeing Like a State by James C. Scott. A review in The Hindu said that the book \\"[dissected] social institutions, policy, and common ideas to explain the many ways the process of ‚Äúgendering‚Äù occurs ‚Äî here making a distinction between ‚Äòsex‚Äô as the biological characteristics and ‚Äògender‚Äô as the set of cultural meanings that are arrived at over time.\\" Writing in the journal Economic and Political Weekly, feminist scholar Mary John said; \\"Written in a highly engrossing style, [the book] takes on very serious issues while also frequently making the reader smile. Nivedita Menon has managed to condense some of the most complex challenges facing the women‚Äôs movement in contemporary India and elsewhere in the form of a series of short reflections that are organised within six chapters.\\" A review in The Guardian noted that \\"Menon succeeds in shattering some deeply-engrained myths, and her efficient gathering of the intersectional strands makes it a breezy but sharp read.\\" Political activism Menon is known for her staunch opposition to nuclear power. Menon has commented on the different portrayals of the Kashmir conflict within India and outside it, and has criticized the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.  Describing Uniform civil code as anti-Muslim  In an article published in The Hindu newspaper on 18 October 2016, Nivedita Menon wrote an article criticizing Uniform civil code (UCC). She wrote that \\"The talk of a Uniform Civil Code has nothing to do with gender justice. It has entirely to do with a Hindu nationalist agenda to ‚Äòdiscipline‚Äô Muslims\\". She went on to describe UCC as \\"A stick to beat Muslims with\\" and claimed that \\"Muslim Personal Law is already modern\\". JNU protests During the protests in JNU in March 2016, Nivedita Menon made a speech titled \\"Nation, a daily plebiscite\\" in which she discussed nation formation, nationalist aspirations, and Kashmir's accession to the Indian Union. The lecture was part of a series about nationalism. The ABVP activist and students union joint secretary Saurabh Kumar Sharma filed a police complaint accusing her of having made anti-national statements to the effect that \\"Everyone knows that India is illegally occupying Kashmir. It is said the world over. Everybody accepts (this)\\". She was also accused of saying, \\"Manipur and Kashmir have been illegally occupied by the Indian state\\". A video clip from her lecture was highlighted by the news channel Zee News, which labelled Menon \\"anti-national\\". In the clip Nivedita said that \\" Hindu Society is the most violent, to the root violent society in the world\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ri3Jvh3lHEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZFCMTSbsRo The incident led to her being targeted for her views by people and student organisations. Menon's actual statement was,\\"We [Indians] must accept that Kashmiri's call for freedom is absolutely justified\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDjyf6Meoa8 She also said \\"We know that people the world over think that India is illegally occupying Kashmir\\". She also said, \\"If people are raising slogans for azadi (freedom), shouldn‚Äôt this be looked at in the context of India being seen as an imperialist country internationally?\\". She also highlighted the fact that Kashmiris equate \\"India\\" and Indian nationalism with militarism and abuse of power. Menon later stated that she had not said anything anti-national. The video of her speech and the reactions to it also led to Menon receiving widespread support online. A number of activists published a statement saying that Menon was being vilified by the media and the police, and that the complaints against her constituted harassment. Friends and students of Menon created a Facebook page in her support. The controversy led to her being described as a figure of dissent against the Hindu right.  Personal life  Menon is known as 'Nivi' to most of her students and peers. She belongs to an upper-caste middle-class family, and was brought up in different parts of India, including Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi. Menon's sister is the queer activist, stand-up comedian, and gender and sexuality consultant Pramada Menon, who co-founded the organization Creating Resources for Empowerment in Action (CREA). Their brother is Dilip Menon, who is a historian at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa.

The accident killed or injured 17 Indian elephants and has been described as the worst of its kind in recent history. Background The Wildlife Protection Society of India reported that 20 elephants were killed in 2007. In 2013, the tally on the Chapramari track, specifically, reached 17 including those killed by the 13 November accident. The number of wild elephants in all of India is thought to be about 26,000. Accident At approximately 17:40 on 13 November, an Assam-bound passenger train travelling through the Chapramari Forest, Jaipur-Kamakhya Kavi Guru Express (19709), approached the Jaldhaka River Bridge at ~80 km/h and collided with a herd of 40‚Äì50 Indian elephants, killing five adults and two calves and injuring ten others. Surviving elephants fled but soon returned to the scene of the accident and remained there until being dispersed by officials. Aftermath Additional Divisional Railway Manager B. Lakra stated, \\"We have heard of the accident. All necessary actions are being taken. Special relief train has been sent and all Assam bound trains are being deviated through alternate route.\\" The track was reopened for service after 12 hours. A meeting to discuss future prevention was held between forest and railway officials on 14 November. According to a telephone interview of Jalpaiguri divisional forest officer Bidyut Sarkar conducted by The New York Times, \\"one female elephant, whose leg was fractured by the train and was unable to stand, fell into a ravine below the track, unreachable by cranes or trucks, so veterinarians descended and set up a camp near her to provide treatment\\". The remains of one elephant were caught up in the structure of the bridge and necessitated disintegration for removal. Some injured elephants remain in critical condition. Jalpaiguri protest A protest seeking better regulation for trains passing through the wildlife sanctuary occurred on 14 November in Jalpaiguri. In an unrelated statement by West Bengal's forest minister, Hiten Burman, it was noted that official requests to a similar effect have been disregarded by railway authorities in the past. Repercussions The accident reignited discussion over the history and administration of the 168 km track, which spans New Jalpaiguri to Alipurduar and also passes through Buxa Tiger Reserve. Animesh Basu, a coordinator for the Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation, criticised the government's response to the issue of its national heritage animal being frequently hit by trains, highlighting the irony of Indian Railways' use of an elephant calf as its mascot. Electric fencing, stationary lighting, and motion sensors have each been proposed as technical measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Investigation Officials plan to launch an investigation into the causes of the accident. Speeding is suspected as a possible contributing factor. The train was traveling at 80 km/h and guidelines specify a limit of 40 km/h. Reaction Minister of State for Railways Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury stated that the accident \\"happened outside the area which has been earmarked as elephant corridor\\" and that it \\"is the responsibility of the state government to protect the wildlife [because] railway officials cannot\\".

Early life Abrahams was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, and brought up in Whitley Bay as the only child in a strongly political family. His father Bennie Abrahams (1906‚Äì1990) was a Labour councillor for the Monkchester ward of Newcastle City Councilfor 35 years, and served as the city's Lord Mayor for one year in 1981-2. His mother Marion Marcelline Abrahams was a concert hall violinist for the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and a Labour councillor in Newcastle . Abrahams was educated at Ascham House preparatory school, now Newcastle School for Boys in Gosforth, and passed his 11+ to Rutherford Grammar School. In 1977, Mohammed Ali paid a visit to the Abrahams family home in Gosforth, where his 105-year- old Grandmother Annie Abrahams chatted to him about the underprivileged . In July 1979, he accompanied his Grandmother aged 107 to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Political career Abrahams was a councillor for the Labour Party on Tyne and Wear County Council for six years from 1979 to 1985 , where his special interest was economic development and voted to bring the Nissan plant to Sunderland a decision that was made on a singular majority vote. He was selected in 1990 as the Labour candidate for Richmond, Yorkshire in the 1992 general election. In 1997 he was unsuccessful in his attempt at selection for the safe Labour seat of Wansbeck near Newcastle. A close associate of Tony Blair and Lord Levy during the New Labour-era, Abrahams was associated with a number of Jewish and pro-Israel groups such as the Trade Union Friends of Israel, the Community Security Trust, the Labour Friends of Israel and Academic Friends of Israel. He served on the Labour Party‚Äôs north east regional executive between 1980 and 2003. Abrahams faced high-profile media accusations in 2007 that he had secretly made ¬£630,000 in donations to the Labour Party, by channelling the donations through four different individuals in what was thought to have been a breach of the electoral law on transparent disclosure. The Donorgate scandal put pressure on then Prime Minister Gordon Brown who set up an internal enquiry, although no report has ever been published. Abrahams was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by the police, in April 2008. The BBC spotlighted Abrahams in their 'Political Lives' series in February 2014, detailing his life's work. In the BBC interview footage he stated that \\"I've been active politically all my life, still am and still taking an active interest in Labour ‚Äì these things don't go away. But it's not the be all and end all, being in the Commons ‚Äì people have still got the qualities, got the skills, still got the talent and use them in different directions.\\" In April 2016, following high-profile remarks made by a Labour MP Naz Shah and the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, Abrahams said that he would no longer financially support the Labour party, claiming it was becoming increasingly anti-semitic. In an article for the Guardian he accused the hard left of perverting the principles of social justice and liberal, progressive politics. Other Interests Abrahams is a Freeman of the City of Londonand a member of the Reform Club in Pall Mall. Abrahams' Twitter page is @davidabrahams 8, where he describes himself as \\"working for peace in the Middle East and prosperity in the North East (UK)\\". Abrahams has been an active supporter of peace initiatives in the Middle East. His diplomatic efforts in many Middle East countries brought him into contact with Yasser Arafat as well as Hamas and other leaders establishing grounds for ongoing dialogue. In 2010 it was reported that Abrahams had met senior Hamas officials including Palestinian Legislative Council speaker Aziz Dwaik and had appeared to wrest a significant change in tone from the Palestinian leadership. He indicated that Hamas officials were prepared to accept ‚Äì but not necessarily recognise ‚Äì the existence of Israel, and they would be prepared to nullify the part of the Hamas charter that calls for the obliteration of Israel. He became Vice President of Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), in Whitehall in 2008 , and subsequently its first global ambassador. His first mission was to organise a conference of Arab foreign ministers to discuss normalisation of relations with Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. During his term of office, he focused on promoting peace within the MENA region paying personal visits to most of the countries to discuss security and defence issues as well as geopolitical alliances whilst attending many conferences at the UN and throughout the area. Whilst at RUSI he initiated the All Party Parliamentary Group on Defence and Diplomacy and is one of their global ambassadors. In 2013 it was reported that he had donated two tranches of ¬£250,000 to found a chair in International Politics of the Middle East at Warwick University from 2005. He has also served as Vice-Chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement, Acting Director of Labour Friends of Israel and on the Executive of the Trade Union Friends of Israel. In 2010, it was reported that used to support \\"more than 70 charitable and voluntary organisations, including male cancer research charity 'Every Man Alive'\\". Since 1968, he has been involved North East Prisons After Care Society (NEPACS). He is currently a trustee and Board Member. He is a former founder and Vice Chair of North East Alzheimer‚Äôs Society and was for many years National Director of The Campaign For Pensioner Poverty. He served for twelve years as a trustee and on the executive of The Council for Christians and Jews, becoming their Director of Parliamentary Affairs. Business Abrahams founded the nationwide ‚ÄúLondon Girl‚Äù group of fashion shops and a chain of hotels in the north east. He has developed more than a hundred new homes in the former pit village of Haswell. In an interview with the Guardian he spoke of the need to create jobs for people in ‚Äúpit villages where there's a lot of deprivation, drugs and crime. People with nothing to do‚Äù. In 2009, Abrahams obtained planning permission to build a 540-acre business park to create jobs on a site which he owned, near Bowburn, outside Durham, with onsite connectivity to the main Edinburgh-London railway line and off Junction 61 on the A1(M). He said he would donate the profits from building the business park to ‚Äúcauses he has supported in the past‚Äù. In 2010, Abrahams was reported to be in talks with 15 potential tenants for a 540-acre site on the edge of Durham. He was subsequently reported to be selling the site. In 2018, it was reported that the Integra 61 project on the site would include industrial units, offices, a hotel, shops, gym, care home, pub and GP surgery. Persimmon Homes obtained permission to build up to 270 houses on the site. In 2019, it was reported that Amazon had bought part of the site and were building a warehouse of almost 2 million square which would create 4,000 new jobs. It is set to open in September 2020.

His parents were Fernando Key Rodr√≠guez and Ana Ayala Anzola. He studied philosophy, math, and natural sciences at the Central University of Venezuela. At this time he began his literary career by writing for the journal El Cojo Ilustrado. He then studied engineering and political science, and wrote articles for the magazine Cosm√≥polis, a publication that helped spread modernismo in Venezuela. Although Key Ayala was at first influenced by the ideas of modernismo, he gradually moved away from the movement, finding his own voice in a prose more in line with his academic and classic spirit. In the 1940s, Key Ayala collected all of the work he had written in a few volumes, which included monographs, articles, as well as research and discourse that had been previously published in the form of brochures and booklets. Alongside his intellectual work, he held various positions as an officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both in Venezuela and abroad. One of these positions was Venezuela's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States in Italy in 1936. Another diplomatic function was to represent the country at the Plenipotentiary Conference for boundary issues with Colombia (1920-1921). He was also a delegate to the Assembly of the League of Nations, the Permanent Court of International Justice, and the Pan-American Conference in Havana. In 1914 he became a member of the Venezuelan Academy of Language and in 1916 he joined the National Academy of History. As a historian, he stands out for his research on Simon Bolivar and other Latin American figures. His books include: Vida ejemplar de Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (for which he obtained the Municipal Prize for Literature in 1942), Luz de Bol√≠var and Cuba y Marti. In addition to writing about historical figures, he was greatly interested in literary research and criticism, which prompted him to write the book Bajo el signo del √Åvila (1949), about some contemporary writers of his time, including Manuel D√≠az Rodr√≠guez, Pedro Emilio Coll, Andr√©s Bello, Aristides Rojas and Juan Antonio P√©rez Bonalde. Since 1933 he wrote a series of books about Venezuelan history, including Series hemero-bibliogr√°ficas, Aluvi√≥n hemerogr√°fico, Cateos de bibliograf√≠a. In 1950 he was awarded the National Prize for Literature. His selected works were published in 1955 in a book titled \\"Obras Selectas\\" (Ediciones EDIME, 1245 pages). Santiago Key Ayala published his work under the name \\"S. Key-Ayala\\" or \\"Santiago Key-Ayala\\", which were strictly not a pseudonyms but simply variants of his actual name.

This infection has a worldwide geographic distribution. Humans with taeniasis can infect other humans or animal intermediate hosts by eggs and gravid proglottids passed in the feces.  Transmission  T. solium eggs can cause cysticercosis in humans. Intermediate hosts, which harbor the disease for a short period of time, include: sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, and deer. Definitive hosts, which harbor the parasite until it reaches maturity and during sexual reproduction, include dogs, foxes, and other canids.Taylor, M.A, Coop, R.L., Wall, R.L. (2007) Veterinary Parasitology Blackwell Publishing. The cysticercus, the larval form, travels and persists in the liver for 18 ‚Äì 30 days, then burrows out into the peritoneal cavity and attaches to the viscera. When the sheep viscera is scavenged and the scavenger ingests the cysticercus, the protoscolex attaches to the small intestinal wall and the worm begins to form proglottids. Gravid proglottids, containing the eggs, move from the end of the worm and leave the body in the feces. The prepatent period is about 51 days.Nolan, Dr. \\"Adult Parasite:.\\" CAL Home. University of Pennsylvania, 2004. Web. 13 Oct. 2013.  Symptoms  Like any other disease, the symptoms vary from its bodily location and when pertaining to the density of larvae. Many of the major symptoms are the result of inflammation during larval degeneration or a mass effect from the parasite. Neurocysticercosis is a serious form of cysticercosis. Common symptoms include chronic headaches and seizures. Other symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, vertigo, ataxia, confusion or other changes in mental health, behavioral abnormalities, progressive dementia, and focal neurologic signs.  Testing and Treatment  Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to identify cysticerci in the brain. An x-ray scan can detect calcified cysts all over the body. A biopsy can be used to look for subcutaneous nodules in the body. An ocular scan can be used to detect larvae in the eyes. (1) Cysticercosis can be treated using anthelmintic drugs (i.e. albendazole and praziquantel). Surgery might be required for cysticerci in the eye, cerebral ventricles, and spinal cord. Asymptomatic infections and calcified cysticerci probably will not require treatment. Fecal flotation may reveal eggs if a gravid proglottid has been broken in the feces. After the animal dies, a necropsy is performed to see if cysticerci are found in the abdominal cavity of sheep and goats.  Prevention  Cysticercosis is rare in the U.S. and most parts of Europe. It is primarily found in immigrant species, or species that have arrived from another country. The main objectives are as follows: to reduce the chances of becoming infected, and, if infected, to reduce the chances of the infection being transmitted. Educating the general public will help change how the disease is perceived. This could help people better understand risks and allow people to not live in fear of the disease. The high prevalence of some zoonotic helminths could indicate that humans in specific regions such as; the mediterranean area, south of the Sahara in the semi-arid areas of East Africa, South Africa, South America, East Europe and parts of China. These areas are at serious risk of transmission and, if all the preventive measures are not taken, the human infection may spread quickly. Preventive programs, such as elimination of the stray dogs from cities and rural regions, could be necessary in this instance. However, control of wild canids can be difficult, but there are other regulatory measures that can be applied to communities, such as health education and implementing strict regulations of livestock slaughtering in slaughter houses and farms, could reduce the risk of parasite transmission. In addition, it is important for public health authorities, pet owners, physicians and veterinarians in these regions to pay close attention to patients and to remain informed of any possible outbreaks and transmission. In a study conducted at Washington State University, the effects of heat treatment were analyzed on the young forms of Taenia hydatigena. They observed that when the eggs were treated at temperatures of 60 degrees C they did not establish in the hosts. This could be influential in future prevention methods.

These plants can sometimes be lost in the canopy. Blackleg is a plant disease of potato caused by pectolytic bacteria that can result in stunting, wilting, chlorosis of leaves, necrosis of several tissues, a decline in yield, and at times the death of the potato plant. The term \\"blackleg\\" originates from the typical blackening and decay of the lower stem portion, or \\"leg\\", of the plant.De Boer S. H. 2004. \\"Blackleg of potato\\". The Plant Health Instructor. DOI:10.1094/PHI-I-2004-0712-01 Blackleg in potatoes is most commonly caused by Pectobacterium atrosepticum (older synonym: Erwinia carotovora subsp. astroseptica), a gram-negative, nonsporulating, facultative anaerobe that is also associated with soft rot of potatoes. While other bacterial species such as Pectobacterium carotovorum and Dickeya dadantii can exhibit symptoms similar to blackleg of potato, these pathogens exhibit broader host ranges, are present in different climates, and typically are more associated with soft rot diseases.Ali HF, Ahmad M, Junaid M, Bibi A, Ali A, Sharif M, Ali B, Nawab K, Sadozai A. 2012. Inoculum Sources, Disease Incidence and Severity of Bacterial Blackleg and Soft Rot of Potato. Pakistan Journal of Botany 44:825-830. Symptoms and signs Stem discoloration and darkening Wilting caused by blackleg Early blackleg symptoms develop in the growing season soon after the plants emerge. They are characterized by stunted, yellowish foliage that has a stiff, upright habit. The lower part of the below ground stem of such plants is dark brown to black in color and extensively decayed. When infected, the pith region of the stem is particularly susceptible to decay and may extend upward in the stem far beyond the tissue with externally visible symptoms. Young plants affected by blackleg are particularly susceptible, typically dying after a halt in development. Blackleg symptoms may develop in more mature plants during the later part of the growing season, and are distinguished from those that develop earlier in the season. Blackleg appears as a black discoloration of previously healthy stems, accompanied by a rapid wilting, and sometimes yellowing, of the leaves. Starting below ground, black discoloration moves up the stem, often until the entire stem is black and wilted. However, in some cases of early disease development, mature stems may turn yellow and wilt even before black decay is evident. However, after the entire stem exhibits disease symptoms, the wilted plant can be lost from view in the healthy potato plant canopy. Disease cycle # A contaminated tuber can infect growing stems, or move into the vascular bundles of mature stems. # Infected stems can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, depending on environmental conditions, although the disease will remain and spread to other tubers on the same plant through the stolons.De Boer S.H. 1994. Prospects for Control of Potato Diseases Caused By Pectolytic Erwinias. Advances in Potato Pest Biology and Management. 136-148. # In the field or during storage, they can contaminate and infect healthy tubers through wounds introduced during harvesting or through lenticels, and may also be spread through insects, wind, and rain. An important insect vector is the seed corn maggot (Hylemya platura and H. florilega), which spread the bacteria from diseased to healthy tissues. The bacteria are carried in the intestinal tracts of these insects, which spread the pathogen to healthy tissue by feeding on cut surfaces of healthy seed tissue. Another insect vector is the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). # The pathogen will often survive in the infected tubers until the following planting season.P√©rombelon MCM. Potato diseases caused by soft rot erwinias: an overview of pathogenesis, p. 1-12, vol. 51, Oxford, UK. Environment and biology The pathogen P. atrosepticum thrives in moist, cool conditions, typically causing symptoms at temperatures below 25 ¬∞C. It is vulnerable to temperatures above 36 ¬∞C and dry conditions, and thus survives best in potato tuber tissues, although it is known to survive in other plant tissues. Unlike other pectolytic bacteria, evidence shows that P. atrosepticum does not survive well in soil outside its host tissue. Disease symptoms are not necessarily uniformly exhibited from both shoots originating from a single tuber or in a field infested with P. atrosepticum. Additionally, presence of P. atrosepticum in the soil is not necessarily associated with disease symptoms. This is partly explained by the narrow environmental conditions needed for pathogenicity, although new findings in research are showing strong evidence of density dependent quorum sensing signals used by P. atrosepticum in exhibiting virulence.Bais HP, Rechsteiner C. 2012. Shoot the Messages Not the Messengers. Plant and Soil 358:6-9. Management=Cultural Blackleg of potato has been successfully managed primarily using cultural techniques. These techniques generally rely on sterile propagation techniques, using knowledge P. atrosepticum's narrow environmental range to control planting timing, removing infected tissues and plants during the growing season, reducing tuber harvest damage, and proper storage. See the sections below for more details. =Sterile propagation= Given that tubers are the primary mechanism by which P. atrosepticum survives and spreads, clean seed potato stocks established using tissue cultures have been very successful in breaking the cycle of carrying disease forward from year to year. Buildup of tuber contamination is limited by reducing the number of field generations of these seed potatoes to 5 to 7 years. Some methods of sterile propagation include planting only healthy, whole seed potatoes. If healthy seed potatoes are to be cut, they should be first warmed to 12¬∞-15 ¬∞C, cut, stored for 2 days at 12¬∞-15 ¬∞C in a humid environment with good air flow. This warming and storing period ensures proper suberization of the tissue, which forms a barrier from P. atrosepticum infestation. =Planting conditions= Given that P. atrosepticum thrives in cool, moist conditions, planting seed potatoes in well-drained soil after soil temperatures have increased well above 10 ¬∞C is very important to halting the onset of the disease early in the plant life cycle, when the plant is more susceptible to the worst effects of the disease. =Nutrition= Increasing application of nitrogen or complete fertilizers have shown reduced incidence of blackleg stem infection. =During the growing season= Although there is a risk of spreading the disease pathogen through injury of healthy plants, if proper techniques are followed, rogueing out all parts of the blackleg-diseased plants can be a useful way to reduce soil inoculum. =At harvest and during storage= Given that P. atrosepticum survives best in the tubers and additionally contributes to soft rot, it is critically important to reduce spread of the pathogen by removing tubers exhibiting soft rot decay before they are spread over grading lines and bin pilers for storage. Reducing post-harvest wounding is also important, especially for seed potatoes. Additionally, it is critically important to keep the potatoes at a low temperature with adequate aeration and humidity control in order to minimize development of the pathogen in infested stocks. Biocontrol and plant resistance New research on P. atrosepticum virulence pathways has elucidated the use of quorum sensing molecules to exhibit pathogenicity. These pathways include the control of the production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in addition to other virulence factors. Research indicating the role of other soil microbes in degrading P. atrosepticum quorum sensing communication molecules provides the possibility for safe and effective control of the disease. Plant defense mechanism studies on P. atrosepticum, used to better understand disease resistance, have focused more on the soft-rot symptoms that can sometimes be associated with P. atrosepticum. However, research is successfully identifying the quantity and type of plant resistance molecules that are produced in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and their effects on the activity and virulence of pathogens such as P. atrosepticum.Kroener A, Hamelin G, Andrivon D, Val F, Umr Igepp I. 2011. Quantitative Resistance of Potato to Pectobacterium Atrosepticum and Phytophthora Infestans: Integrating PAMP- Triggered Response and Pathogen Growth. PLoS One 6:23331. Importance=History The symptoms of Blackleg of Potato were first described in Germany between 1878 and 1900, but the descriptions were incomplete and cannot definitively be linked to the particular disease. The first complete descriptions of Blackleg in potatoes were formed between 1901 and 1917 by several different scientists. These descriptions consisted of many different names, such as Bacillus phytophthorus, Bacillus omnivorus, Bacillus oleraceae, Bacillus atrosepticus, Bacillus aroideae, Bacillus solanisaprus, and Bacillus melanogenes. Investigations between 1918 and 1958 confirmed that these bacteria were of a single species, and were officially appointed the name Pectobacterium carotovorum. A variety of Pectobacterium (P. carotovorum var. atrosepticum, which includes B. melanogenes and B. phytophthorus) can be differentiated from the rest, although it is considered the same species of bacteria.Hellmers E. 1959. Pectobacterium carotovorum var.Atrosepticum (van Hall) Dowson the correct name of the potato black leg pathogen; A historical and critical review. European Potato Journal 2:251-271. Although it was an important disease historically, Blackleg of potato is less of an issue today due to very successful results from changes in cultural practices regarding seed potato certification programs. As a major problem in wet, cool seasons and irrigated fields, historically it has more heavily impacted northern U.S. states with climates amenable to disease development, with disease incidence levels as high as 10%. In places like Scotland, it historically has had disease incidence levels of up to 30%.Rich A. 1983. Potato Diseases. Academic Press. Victoria, Australia also had issues with this disease in the past.\\"Potatoes - black leg and soft rot\\" In terms of the impact of the disease on yields, one past study indicated that for every 1% increase in disease incidence, yields generally trended down at 0.8%.Bain RA, Perombelon MCM. 1990. BLACKLEG DEVELOPMENT AND TUBER YIELD IN RELATION TO NUMBERS OF ERWINIA- CAROTOVORA SUBSP ATROSEPTICA ON SEED POTATOES. Plant Pathol. 39:125-133. Resistance Given the success with cultural control practices in managing the disease, cultivars resistance is better characterized in the U.S. by susceptible varieties. Washington State University, which has posted a large comprehensive list of potato cultivars available in North America, only calls out two blackleg susceptible varieties: Monona and Superior.\\"Washington State University: Research and Extension: Potato Varieties: A Comprehensive List\\" In the U.K., and more specifically in Scotland, where the disease has been an issue, they better characterize blackleg-resistant varieties. Varieties with resistance values of 6-9 on a scale of 1-9 include Avondale, Axona, Bonnie, Cara, Emma, Isle Of Jura, Orla, Osprey, Sarpo Mira, Saxon, Sebastian, Vales Sovereign.

George Viner was the second son of Viner Ellis of Duni House, Minsterworth, near Gloucester, his family having been landowners in the area for many years. His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin. Ellis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention. In 1840 he published \\"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890. University College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty- eight plates, \\"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton. During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons. On his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish. A few years before his death he became blind and was tended by his sister. \\"Ellis' muscle\\", the Corrugator cutis ani muscle, is named after him.

Career Recipient of the prestigious PSU Class of 1933 Award for Distinction in the Humanities (March 2011), he pursues research in 17th-Century French Literature and Philosophy; Post-structuralism and Reception theories; Baroque Episteme; Semiotics of Drama; Theater and Performance Theories; Continental Philosophy and Contemporary French Literature. Inspired by the Foucaldian notion of √©pist√©m√®, and by the \\"linguistic turn\\" combined to the \\"actor paradigm,\\" JC Vuillemin has continually challenged the ideological perception of a \\"classical\\" France and advocated the pertinence of the Baroque as a pertinent concept to be applied not only to architecture and visual arts, but also to literature and philosophy. Although it may be argued that a major methodological interest of the Baroque hypothesis lies in its very imprecision, his latest book, √âpist√©m√® baroque: le mot et la chose (Hermann, 2013) provides a new theory for a concept which JC Vuillemin associates with the epistemological breakdown Europe experienced in the wake of the emergence of Modern science. As a conceptual framework in which poetics, politics, and epistemology interact, his conception of the Baroque is much less aesthetic than purposefully philosophical.Venner 2013. According to JC Vuillemin, Sapere aude ('dare to know') should be the motto of the Baroque. JC Vuillemin collaborated to the first critical edition of Jean Rotrou‚Äôs complete theater (Belles-Lettres / Sorbonne-Paris-4, 1998-2017) and he published in 2017 an annotated digital bibliography: Jean de Rotrou: bibliographie critique . Vuillemin collaborated as well to the first Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century French Philosophers (Thoemmes Press / CNRS; trans. for Classiques Garnier). In addition to his book on Baroque episteme, he wrote one book on Rotrou‚Äôs dramaturgy (Baroquisme et th√©√¢tralit√©), three critical editions of Rotrou's plays (L‚ÄôHypocondriaque; L‚ÄôInnocente Infid√©lit√©; La Belle Alphr√®de), and he has authored many articles, book chapters, and reviews. He frequently lectures on both sides of the Atlantic. In his latest book, Foucault l'intempestif (Hermann, 2019), he revisits and clarifies some key concepts of the so-called \\"pens√©e Foucault,\\" and pleads for the emergence of a \\"post-Cartesian\\" subject whose discourse (logos) will be congruent with his or her actions (ergon).

The low-cost device consists of a plastic sleeve that is inflated around the baby's head and is used to gently pull and ease the head of the infant through the birth canal.McNeil, Donald G, Jr. \\"Car Mechanic Dreams Up a Tool to Ease Births\\", The New York Times, November 13, 2013. Accessed November 14, 2013. Need Worldwide, more than 13 million births each year face serious complications, and every day about 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth (about 300,000 annually). The use of forceps and other mechanical devices in the extraction of a baby in a difficult delivery can cause internal bleeding in the mother or may result in injuries to the baby's head or spine. The Od√≥n device has the potential to allow for vaginal delivery in complicated pregnancies in which common medical practice would have led to a cesarean section, the use of forceps to extract the newborn or the use of a ventouse vacuum device that attaches suction cups directly to the baby's scalp. By reducing contact between the baby's skull and the birth canal, the risk of infection is also reduced. Conception The device was developed by Jorge Od√≥n, a car mechanic from Lan√∫s, Argentina who had seen a video describing a method to extract a loose cork from inside an empty wine bottle by inserting a plastic bag into the bottle, inflating the bag once it has enveloped the cork and then pulling out the inflated bag together with the cork. Od√≥n conceived of the use of this same technique that evening in bed and spoke with an obstetrician who encouraged him to move ahead with the idea. The first model of the device was created by sewing a sleeve onto a cloth bag and was tested using a doll inserted into a glass jar to simulate the use of the device in the delivery process. In complicated deliveries, the device is positioned against the baby's scalp and the lubricated sleeve is gently inserted around the baby's head. Once a marker on the device indicates that it has been positioned properly, the inner compartment of the sleeve is inflated, providing a strong grip on the baby's head. The inserter is taken away and the sleeve can be pulled with up to of force to pull out the head and allow for delivery of the baby.Device, Od√≥n Device. Accessed November 14, 2013. Testing and development After further testing, Od√≥n was introduced to the chief of obstetrics at a hospital in Buenos Aires who saw the benefit of the method and arranged to have the device tested more thoroughly at an Iowa laboratory that has simulators designed to model delivery methods more realistically. Safety testing had been performed on 20 women in Argentina, all of whom had previously given birth and were experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies, including a woman who was able to deliver a baby weighing with only two pushes. Further testing will be conducted on more than 250 women in China, India and South Africa, with a mix of pregnant women experiencing normal and complicated labor. Becton Dickinson has agreed to manufacture and distribute the unit, and estimates that the Od√≥n device could be constructed for $50 per unit, and it is expected that it could be used by midwives as well as obstetricians who would need minimal training to use the device effectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) offered favorable notices regarding the device, which was recognized for its \\"potential to save the lives of mothers and newborns at the time of birth\\".New, low-cost instrument for assisted vaginal delivery, World Health Organization. Accessed November 14, 2013. The WHO's Dr. Mario Merialdi called the device \\"exciting\\", saying that childbirth is an area that has had little recent progress. Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO, described the device as \\"a low-cost simplified way to deliver babies, and protect mothers [that] promises to transfer life-saving capacity to rural health posts, which almost never have the facilities and staff to perform a C-section [as] the first simple new tool for assisted delivery since forceps and vacuum extractors were introduced centuries ago.\\"\\"The WHO Director-General highlights World Health Organization work in her speech to the 65 World Health Assembly\\" , Od√≥n Device.

The source location is usually determined by the direction of the incoming sound waves (horizontal and vertical angles) and the distance between the source and sensors. It involves the structure arrangement design of the sensors and signal processing techniques. Most mammals (including humans) use binaural hearing to localize sound, by comparing the information received from each ear in a complex process that involves a significant amount of synthesis. It is difficult to localize using monaural hearing, especially in 3D space. Technology Sound localization technology is used in some audio and acoustics fields, such as hearing aids, surveillance and navigation. Existing real-time passive sound localization systems are mainly based on the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) approach, limiting sound localization to two-dimensional space, and are not practical in noisy conditions. Applications Collecting Multibeam Sonar Data Applications of sound source localization include sound source separation, sound source tracking, and speech enhancement. Sonar uses sound source localization techniques to identify the location of a target. 3D sound localization is also used for effective human-robot interaction. With the increasing demand for robotic hearing, some applications of 3D sound localization such as human-machine interface, handicapped aid, and military applications, are being explored. Cues for sound localization Localization cues are features that help localize sound. Cues for sound localization include binaural and monoaural cues. *Monoaural cues can be obtained via spectral analysis and are generally used in vertical localization. *Binaural cues are generated by the difference in hearing between the left and right ears. These differences include the interaural time difference (ITD) and the interaural intensity difference (IID). Binaural cues are used mostly for horizontal localization. Methods There are many different methods of 3D sound localization. For instance: *Different types of sensor structure, such as microphone array and binaural hearing robot head. *Different techniques for optimal results, such as neural network, maximum likelihood and Multiple signal classification (MUSIC). *Real-time methods using an Acoustic Vector Sensor (AVS) array *Offline methods (according to timeliness) *Microphone Array Approach Steered Beamformer Approach This approach utilizes eight microphones combined with a steered beamformer enhanced by the Reliability Weighted Phase Transform (RWPHAT). The final results are filtered through a particle filter that tracks sources and prevents false directions. The motivation of using this method is that based on previous research. This method is used for multiple sound source tracking and localizing despite soundtracking and localization only apply for a single sound source. =Beamformer-based Sound Localization= To maximize the output energy of a delay-and-sum beamformer in order to find the maximum value of the output of a beamformer steered in all possible directions. Using the Reliability Weighted Phase Transform (RWPHAT) method, The output energy of M-microphone delay-and- sum beamformer is :E = K + 2\\\\sum_{{m}_{1}=1}^{M-1} \\\\sum_{{m}_{2}=0}^{{m}_{1}-1}{{R}^\\\\text{RWPHAT}}_{i,j}\\\\left({\\\\tau}_{{m}_{1}}-{\\\\tau}_{{m}_{2}} \\\\right) Where E indicates the energy, and K is a constant, {{R}^\\\\text{RWPHAT}}_{i,j}\\\\left({\\\\tau}_{{m}_{1}}-{\\\\tau}_{{m}_{2}} \\\\right) is the microphone pairs cross-correlation defined by Reliability Weighted Phase Transform: :{{R}^\\\\text{RWPHAT}}_{i,j}\\\\left(\\\\tau \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}\\\\frac{{\\\\zeta }_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right){X}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right){\\\\zeta }_{j}\\\\left(k \\\\right){{X}_{j}}^{*}\\\\left(k \\\\right)}{\\\\left{X}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\left{X}_{j}\\\\left(k \\\\right) \\\\right}{e}^{j2\\\\pi k\\\\tau /L} the weighted factor {{\\\\zeta}^{n}}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right)reflect the reliability of each frequency component, and defined as the Wiener Filter gain {{\\\\zeta}^{n}}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right) = \\\\frac{{{\\\\xi }^{n}}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right)}{{{\\\\xi }^{n}}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right)+1}, where {{\\\\xi }^{n}}_{i}\\\\left(k \\\\right) is an estimate of a prior SNR at i^{th} microphone, at time frame n, for frequency k, computed using the decision-directed approach. The x_{m_n} is the signal from {m}^{th} microphone and {\\\\tau}_{{m}_{n}} is the delay of arrival for that microphone. The more specific procedure of this method is proposed by Valin and Michaud The advantage of this method is that it detects the direction of the sound and derives the distance of sound sources. The main drawback of the beamforming approach is the imperfect nature of sound localization accuracy and capability, versus the neural network approach, which uses moving speakers. Collocated Microphone Array Approach This approach pertains to Real-time sound localization that uses an Acoustic Vector Sensor (AVS) array. =Acoustic Vector Array= AVS array: XYZO array ‚Ä¢ Contains three orthogonally installed acoustic particle velocity gradient microphones (shown as X, Y and Z array) and one omnidirectional acoustic microphone (O). ‚Ä¢ Commonly used underwater. ‚Ä¢ Uses the Offline Calibration Process to measure and interpolate the impulse response of X, Y, Z and O arrays, to obtain their steering vector. A sound signal is first windowed using a rectangular window, then each resulting segment signal is created as a frame. 4 parallel frames are detected from XYZO array and used for DOA estimation. The 4 frames are split into small blocks with equal size, then the Hamming window and FFT are used to convert each block from a time domain to a frequency domain. Then the output of this system is represented by a horizontal angle and a vertical angle of the sound sources which is found by the peak in the combined 3D spatial spectrum. The advantages of this array, compared with past microphone array, are that this device has a high performance even if the aperture is small, and it can localize multiple low frequency and high frequency wide band sound sources simultaneously. Applying an O array can make more available acoustic information, such as amplitude and time difference. Most importantly, XYZO array has a better performance with a tiny size. The AVS is one kind of collocated multiple microphone array, it makes use of a multiple microphone array approach for estimating the sound directions by multiple arrays and then finds the locations by using reflection information such as where the direction is detected where different arrays cross. =Motivation of the Advanced Microphone array= Sound reflections always occur in an actual environment and microphone arrays cannot avoid observing those reflections. This multiple array approach was tested using fixed arrays in the ceiling; the performance of the moving scenario still need to be tested. =Learning how to apply Multiple Microphone Array= Angle uncertainty (AU) will occur when estimating direction, and position uncertainty (PU) will also aggravate with increasing distance between the array and the source. We know that: :PU \\\\left(r \\\\right)= \\\\frac{\\\\pm AU}{360 } \\\\times 2 \\\\pi \\\\times r Where r is the distance between array center to source, and AU is angle uncertainly. Measurement is used for judging whether two directions cross at some location or not. Minimum distance between two lines: :dist \\\\left(dir_1,dir_2 \\\\right)=\\\\frac{ \\\\left( \\\\overrightarrow{v_1} \\\\times \\\\overrightarrow{v_2} \\\\right) \\\\times \\\\overrightarrow{p_1 p_2}}{ \\\\left \\\\overrightarrow{v_1} \\\\times \\\\overrightarrow{v_2} \\\\right} wheredir_1and dir_2 are two directions, v_i are vectors parallel to detected direction, and p_i are the position of arrays. If :dist(dir_1,dir_2) Two lines are judged as crossing. When two lines are crossing, we can compute the sound source location using the following: :\\\\mathrm{POS}_{source} = \\\\frac {\\\\left( \\\\mathrm{POS}_1 \\\\times w_1 + \\\\mathrm{POS}_2 \\\\times w_2 \\\\right)}{w_1 + w_2 } \\\\mathrm{POS}_{source} is the estimation of sound source position, \\\\mathrm{POS}_n is the position where each direction intersect the line with minimum distance, and w_n is the weighted factors. As the weighting factor w_n, we determined use PU or r from the array to the line with minimum distance. Learning method for binaural hearing  Structure of the binaural robot dummy head Binaural hearing learning is a bionic method. The sensor is a robot dummy head with 2 sensor microphones along with the artificial pinna (reflector). The robot head has 2 rotation axes and can rotate horizontally and vertically. The reflector causes the spectrum change into a certain pattern for incoming white noise sound wave and this pattern is used for the cue of the vertical localization. The cue for horizontal localization is ITD. The system makes use of a learning process using neural networks by rotating the head with a settled white noise sound source and analyzing the spectrum. Experiments show that the system can identify the direction of the source well in a certain range of angle of arrival. It cannot identify the sound coming outside the range due to the collapsed spectrum pattern of the reflector. Binaural hearing use only 2 microphones and is capable of concentrating on one source among multiple sources of noises. Head-related Transfer Function (HRTF) In the real sound localization, the robot head and the torso play a functional role, in addition to the two pinnae. This functions as spatial linear filtering and the filtering is always quantified in terms of Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF). HRTF also uses the robot head sensor, which is the binaural hearing model. The HRTF can be derived based on various cues for localization. Sound localization with HRTF is filtering the input signal with a filter which is designed based on the HRTF. Instead of using the neural networks, a head-related transfer function is used and the localization is based on a simple correlation approach. See more: Head-related transfer function. Cross-power spectrum phase (CSP) analysis CSP method is also used for the binaural model. The idea is that the angle of arrival can be derived through the time delay of arrival (TDOA) between two microphones, and TDOA can be estimated by finding the maximum coefficients of CSP. CSP coefficients are derived by: :csp_{ij}(k)=\\\\text{IFFT}\\\\left { \\\\frac{\\\\text{FFT}[s_{i}(n)]\\\\cdot \\\\text{FFT}[s_{j}(n)]^*} {\\\\left \\\\text{FFT}[s_{i}(n)]\\\\right \\\\vert \\\\cdot \\\\left \\\\text{FFT}[s_{j}(n)]\\\\right \\\\vert \\\\quad} \\\\right } \\\\quad Where s_{i}(n) and s_{j}(n) are signals entering the microphone i and j respectively Time delay of arrival(\\\\tau) then can be estimated by: :{\\\\tau}= \\\\operatorname{arg} \\\\max{csp_{ij}(k)} Sound source direction is :{\\\\theta}=\\\\cos^{-1}\\\\frac{v\\\\cdot \\\\tau}{d_{\\\\max}\\\\cdot F_{s}} Where v is the sound propagation speed, F_{s} is the sampling frequency and d_{max} is the distance with maximum time delay between 2 microphones. CPS method does not require the system impulse response data that HRTF needs. An expectation- maximization algorithm is also used for localizing several sound sources and reduce the localization errors. The system is capable of identifying several moving sound source using only two microphones. 2D sensor line array Demonstration of 2d line sensor array In order to estimate the location of a source in 3D space, two line sensor arrays can be placed horizontally and vertically. An example is a 2D line array used for underwater source localization. By processing the data from two arrays using the maximum likelihood method, the direction, range and depth of the source can be identified simultaneously. Unlike the binaural hearing model, this method is similar to the spectral analysis method. The method can be used to localize a distant source. Hierarchical Fuzzy Artificial Neural Networks Approach Structure of How to derive the Azimuth Estimation The Hierarchical Fuzzy Artificial Neural Networks Approach sound localization system was modelled on biologically binaural sound localization. Some primitive animals with two ears and small brains can perceive 3D space and process sounds, although the process is not fully understood. Some animals experience difficulty in 3D sound location due to small head size. Additionally, the wavelength of communication sound may be much larger than their head diameter, as is the case with frogs. Based on previous binaural sound localization methods, a hierarchical fuzzy artificial neural network system combines interaural time difference(ITD-based) and interaural intensity difference(IID-based) sound localization methods for higher accuracy that is similar to that of humans. Hierarchical Fuzzy Artificial Neural Networks were used with the goal of the same sound localization accuracy as human ears. IID-based or ITD-based sound localization methods have a main problem called Front-back confusion. In this sound localization based on a hierarchical neural network system, to solve this issue, an IID estimation is with ITD estimation. This system was used for broadband sounds and be deployed for non-stationary scenarios. 3D sound localization for monaural sound source  Typically, sound localization is performed by using two (or more) microphones. By using the difference of arrival times of a sound at the two microphones, one can mathematically estimate the direction of the sound source. However, the accuracy with which an array of microphones can localize a sound (using Interaural time difference) is fundamentally limited by the physical size of the array. If the array is too small, then the microphones are spaced too closely together so that they all record essentially the same sound (with ITF near zero), making it extremely difficult to estimate the orientation. Thus, it is not uncommon for microphone arrays to range from tens of centimeters in length (for desktop applications) to many tens of meters in length (for underwater localization). However, microphone arrays of this size then become impractical to use on small robots. even for large robots, such microphone arrays can be cumbersome to mount and to manoeuvre. In contrast, the ability to localize sound using a single microphone (which can be made extremely small) holds the potential of significantly more compact, as well as lower cost and power, devices for localization. ‚Ä¢ Conventional HRTF approach A general way to implement 3d sound localization is to use the HRTF(Head-related transfer function). First, compute HRTFs for the 3D sound localization, by formulating two equations; one represents the signal of a given sound source and the other indicates the signal output from the robot head microphones for the sound transferred from the source. Monaural input data are processed by these HRTFs, and the results are output from stereo headphones. The disadvantage of this method is that many parametric operations are necessary for the whole set of filters to realize the 3D sound localization, resulting in high computational complexity. ‚Ä¢ DSP implementation of 3D sound localization dsp implementation of 3d sound localization A DSP-based implementation of a realtime 3D sound localization approach with the use of an embedded DSP can reduce the computational complexity As shown in the figure, the implementation procedure of this realtime algorithm is divided into three phases, (i) Frequency Division, (ii) Sound Localization, and (iii) Mixing. In the case of 3D sound localization for a monaural sound source, the audio input data are divided into two: left and right channels and the audio input data in time series are processed one after another. A distinctive feature of this approach is that the audible frequency band is divided into three so that a distinct procedure of 3D sound localization can be exploited for each of the three subbands. ‚Ä¢ Single microphone approach Monaural localization is made possible by the structure of the pinna (outer ear), which modifies the sound in a way that is dependent on its incident angle. A machine learning approach is adapted for monaural localization using only a single microphone and an ‚Äúartificial pinna‚Äù (that distorts sound in a direction-dependent way). The approach models the typical distribution of natural and artificial sounds, as well as the direction- dependent changes to sounds induced by the pinna. The experimental results also show that the algorithm is able to fairly accurately localize a wide range of sounds, such as human speech, dog barking, waterfall, thunder, and so on. In contrast to microphone arrays, this approach also offers the potential of significantly more compact, as well as lower cost and power, devices for sound localization.

He was born in London, England and in 1861 married Maria Frederica Davies, a niece of the great statesman, George Canning. Having emigrated to Victoria (Australia) in 1852, Black left the goldfields of that colony to try his luck in pastoral pursuits in South Australia, subsequently going to the Riverina, and in 1864 to Queensland. Black was the inventor of a steam sheep- washing process, and went into sugar planting in the Mackay district of Queensland in 1871. Brawls during the elections at Mackay in 1883. The political contestants were Maurice Hume Black and Thomas Campbell. In 1881 Black was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the seat of Mackay. Having taken a prominent part in the agitation for the separation of Northern Queensland from the rest of the colony, and its formation into a distinct colony, he was in 1887 commissioned to go to England with Mr. Lissner to press the matter upon the attention of the Home Government, Harold Finch-Hatton and Dr. Ahearne having done much to bring the matter into the region of practical politics by their exertions during the previous year. Though not successful in inducing Lord Knutsford to take steps for the separation of Northern Queensland, the advanced phase which the question has since assumed is a good deal due to the efforts of the delegation of 1887. In June 1888, on the formation of the second Thomas McIlwraith Administration, Black became Secretary of Public Works, and continued to hold the post when five months later the Ministry was reconstructed under Boyd Dunlop Morehead. Black resigned with his colleagues in August 1890. Black left Parliament in April 1893 and worked as an immigration agent in the agent-general's office in London; this post was abolished in 1894. Then Black decided to try his luck on the Coolgardie, Western Australia goldfields with some of his family; he arrived in 1896 and set up as an attorney for mining companies. Black died in Coolgardie on 16 August 1899 of cirrhosis of the liver and cardiac failure and was buried in the Coolgardie Cemetery.Coolgardie Cemetery A-E ‚Äì Outback family history.

The Semail Ophiolite of the Hajar Mountains of Oman and the United Arab Emirates is a large slab of oceanic crust, made of volcanic rocks and ultramafic rocks from the Earth's upper mantle, that was overthrust onto continental crust as an ophiolite. It is located on the eastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula and covers an area of approximately 100,000 km2. Based on uranium-lead dating techniques, the Semail Ophiolite formed in the Late Cretaceous. It is primarily made of silicate rocks with (SiO2) content ranging from 45‚Äì77 wt%. The Semail Ophiolite is important because it is rich in copper and chromite ore bodies, and because it also provides valuable information about the ocean floor and the upper mantle on land. Geologists have studied the area, attempting to find the best model explaining the formation of the Semail Ophiolite. Geologic formations The Arabian continental margin formed in the early Paleozoic and possibly the late Proterozoic. After that the thrust sheets are from low to high structurally: the autochthonous units, and the allochthonous units. The allochthonous units, from low to high structurally, are the Sumeini group, the Hawasina complex, the Haybi complex, the Ophiolite, and the Batinah complex. From the Sumeini group to the Haybi Complex make up the continental slope with an age range from Middle Triassic to Late Cretaceous. The ophiolite formed in the Late Cretaceous and consists of a basal metamorphic sole (150‚Äì200 m), peridotite tectonic (8‚Äì12 km), igneous peridotite and gabbro (0.5‚Äì6.5 km), sheeted dikes (1‚Äì1.5 km), and lavas (0.5‚Äì2.0 km). The Batinah complex containing continental margin sediments came from beneath the ophiolite during late-stage extensional faulting and then slid into the ophiolite late in the emplacement history. Tectonic models There are three different models that may explain how the Semail Ophiolite could form and overthrust a continental margin: *The gravity sliding model: A 7 to 20 km thick ophiolitic terrane could slide onto a continental margin. This requires an elevated source region, which presents difficulties. *The suprasubduction model: The obduction of an arc-trench gap ophiolite due to the collision of a volcanic arc and a passive continental margin (Fig. 2). Figure 2-A, older than 101 to 95 Ma the mid-ocean ridge is spreading and the ocean lithosphere subducted under the continental lithosphere on the right while the other side is overriding the oceanic lithosphere on the left. Also, that is where the proto Semail Ophiolite and volcanism starts to form a volcanic arc. Figure 2-B, from 95 to 87 Ma the mid- ocean ridge is spreading and a volcanic arc has formed. Figure 2-C, from 87 to 76 Ma the mid-ocean ridge is spreading and the ocean lithosphere being pushed and over thrusted the continental lithosphere by the help of the volcanic arc. *The obducting model: The oceanic lithosphere over thrust continental lithosphere (Fig. 3). Figure 3-A, older than 101 to 95 Ma the mid-ocean ridge is spreading and the oceanic lithosphere subducted under both continental lithosphere. The Semail Ophiolite initial place is marked on the right oceanic lithosphere. Figure 3-B, from 95 to 87 Ma the mid-ocean ridge stopped spreading and the intra-oceanic thrusting started. Where the left oceanic lithosphere subducted under the right oceanic lithosphere with the Semail Ophiolite, which are accreted at amphibolite facies conditions at the base of the Semail Ophiolite. Figure 3-C, from 87 to 76 Ma the Semail Ophiolite overthrusts the continental lithosphere and is emplaced onto the craton, which are accreted at greenschist-facies conditions at the base of the Semail Ophiolite.

She worked as the Head of the Youth Committee and spokesperson with the \\"Solidarnost\\" movement. After moving abroad, she worked at the German Bundestag and since 2018 at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Education  Rybachenko studied Political science at the State Academic University for the Humanities in Moscow and graduated with a major in International Relations from Tallinn University of Technology. She earned her Master's degree from Freie Universit√§t Berlin in 2016.  Political career  Since December 2008, Rybachenko was a member of the democratic movement \\"Solidarnost\\", which was founded around the same time. She worked at the political campaign staff of Sergei Davidis, a candidate in the 2009 Moscow City Duma election. In 2010, Rybachenko was elected to the Political Council of Solidarnost in Moscow and was the youngest member of the management board. In 2011, she was re-elected. Since 2010, Rybachenko represented Solidarnost at the Coordination Committee of the Strategy-31 campaign. The participating organizations, among them the Moscow Helsinki Group, the Memorial human rights centre and the Other Russia party, organized a series of civic protests in support of the right to peaceful assembly guaranteed by Article 31 of the Russian Constitution. In March 2010, Rybachenko became the Head of the Youth Committee of Solidarnost in Moscow. She organized lectures of politicians and other public figures at Moscow universities (Yulia Latynina, Vladimir Ryzhkov, Valery Panyushkin, Mikhail Delyagin, Alexei Navalny and lawyers of Mikhail Khodorkovsky). In December 2010, Rybachenko was among the observers of the Presidential election in Belarus. Following the demonstration of protest on December 19, in Minsk, Rybachenko initiated a campaign in Moscow to support the Russian citizens arrested in Belarus. Activists of Solidarnost collected signatures, maintained media campaign and negotiated with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The campaigners persuaded the Russian authorities to engage more actively in the cases of two Russian citizens Ivan Gaponov and Artyom Breus, and later on in the case of Belarussian citizen Fedor Mirzayanov, in order to, as activists maintained, represent interests of his father, a citizen of Russia. While Gaponov and Breus were released, in the case of Mirzayanov activists only achieved representatives of the Russian embassy in Minsk to observe the trial, but Mirzayanov was nevertheless sentenced to three years in prison. In March 2012, Rybachenko became the Head of the Press Office of Solidarnost in Moscow. She recruited and trained volunteers for the Press Office, managed communications with media, in particular for the campaign of Solidarnost to support Yevgeny Urlashov in the mayoral election in the large Russian city of Yaroslavl. On May 6, 2012, Rybachenko was one of many thousands who demonstrated in Bolotnaya Square, Moscow, to support fair elections of the President of Russia. As the Russian government began suppressing independent civic activities following the demonstration, Rybachenko has been among those who left Russia. She studied in Estonia and then in Germany and participated in several political initiatives and publications. While in Germany, she worked as an assistant to a member of the German Parliament. In 2018, Rybachenko joined the OSCE office in the Netherlands.

She was born in a small farming village but left early for Acapulco and Mexico City to find a better life. In the capital, she was hired as a model for artists at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" and as such became part of the circle of notable artists of that time. Their influenced encouraged her to draw and paint, with Carlos Orozco Romero discouraging her from formal instruction as to not destroy her style. She began exhibiting in 1958 and since then has exhibited individually and collectively in Mexico, the United States and Europe. Her work has been recognized with awards and membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Life Display of the work of Julia Lopez as part of the Seis Artistas, Un Sue√±o exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, Toluca L√≥pez was born in 1936 in a small village near the town of Ometepec on the Costa Chica of Guerrero. She was one of eight daughters born to African and Amuzgo heritage parents. The parents were farmers, raising cotton, chili peppers, tobacco, sesame seed, bananas and other crops. She has stated that she was blessed to have the childhood that she did, which would not have been possible in a big city. However, she wanted more in life and began her journey by going to Ometepec to work in a hotel called Casa Verde when she was only thirteen years old. In 1951, she moved, this time to Acapulco, where she worked in a hotel kitchen. During this time she did not attend school but rather taught herself to read and do basic math. Her final move was to Mexico City, finding initial employment modeling bridal and other formal dresses. This job allowed her to meet a number of people, especially from Coyoac√°n including a muralist that introduced her to Frida Kahlo in 1952. She gave her a card to present herself to Antonio M. Ru√≠z, then director of La Esmeralda. Her professionalism in her work allowed her to model for most of the well-known artists of the mid-20th century such as Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Vlady and even Diego Rivera at La Esmeralda and at the Academy of San Carlos. While doing this, she listened carefully to teachers‚Äô comments to students and integrated herself with this artistic community. She initially remained very poor, along with her artist friends, which included Alberto Gironella, H√©ctor Javier, Lauro L√≥pez, Vlady and Jos√© Luis Cuevas, sharing accommodations, food and work. She began sketching on old bread wrappers, images of saints, horses, seahorses and other familiar elements. She showed her work to Carlos Orozco Romero, who encouraged her novel style and critiquing her work. She suggested and exchange where she would pose and he would teach her to paint. However, Orozco Romero convinced her that the classes would take away her spontaneity. As she developed her artistic career, she had three daughters of her own. She also had a nine-year relationship with painter Rafael Coronel, which whom she raised his son Juan along with her own children. The couple separated but remained on good terms. She currently lives and works in Mexico City. Art career L√≥pez developed her art career while continuing to pose in order to earn money for materials. She began exhibiting in 1958 and since then her work has been shown in various parts of Mexico, the United States and in Europe. Major exhibitions include the Galer√≠a de Artes Visuales (1958, sponsored by Orozco Romero, with favorable reviews), the Galer√≠a Los Petules in Xalapa (1959), the Galer√≠a Prisse (supported by various artists such as Enrique Echeverr√≠a, Alberto Gironella and H√©ctor Xavier), the Galer√≠a Mexicana de Arte in Mexico City (1961, 1962), the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana (1963, 1967, 1969, 1972), Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, the Mexican Museum in San Francisco, the Fine Art Gallery of California, the Centro Cultural M√©xico-Italia Andriano Olivetti (1980), the Palace of Iturbide (1981), the Galer√≠a Misrachi (1985), the Museo de Arte e Historia in Ciudad Ju√°rez (1985), Museo de Arte Moderno (1988), the Palacio de Miner√≠a (1988), Officina d‚ÄôArte Accademia in Verona, Italy (1996) and the Instituto Cam√µes in Lisbon (2013). She regularly exhibits with the Galer√≠a Telento in Mexico City and at the Galer√≠a La siempre Habana in Cuernavaca. Her work can be found in the collections of over forty museums and galleries, but most of her work is in private collections in Mexico and abroad. Her work was first recognized with a first place prize at a competition held at the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Later she received the New Vales Prize from the Fine Art Gallery of California. She is a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Three books have been written about her life and work Los colores m√°gicos de Julia L√≥pez (1995), Fiori e Canti, Nella Pittura di Julia L√≥pez (1996, in Italian) and Due√±a de la luz (1998). Artistry L√≥pez‚Äôs experience at La Esmeralda influenced her themes but the development of her artistic style was self-taught. She is of the age of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura but her work is considered part of the Mexican muralism movement. Most of her work relates to her experiences growing up, with dark-skinned figures, almost always female, in flowery clothes in tropical settings. Her work has been described as having an indigenous quality as well as exalting the simple pleasures of life. Rafael Coronel stated that ‚Äúher works are not premeditated, they are born. They deny symbols, but translate legends.‚Äù He also stated that while Kahlo painted tragedy, L√≥pez paints paradise.

He was elected Imam in 1742 in place of Saif bin Sultan II. His predecessor called on the Persians for assistance. In mid-1743 Sultan bin Murshid died while defending the town of Sohar against the Persian force. Accession Sultan bin Murshid bin Jadi belonged to a distant branch of the ruling Yaruba dynasty, but is also said to have been the grandson of the great Imam of Oman, Saif bin Sultan. His cousin, the Imam Saif bin Sultan II, led a self-indulgent life that turned the tribes against him. In February 1742 Sultan bin Murshid was proclaimed Imam in his place. Sultan bin Murshid was installed at Nakhal. He gathered troops and marched on Rustaq. Saif bin Sultan II also raised troops and counter-marched, but was too late to prevent the fall of Rustaq. He retreated to the town of Muscat and took a defensive stance. Sultan bin Murshid followed him to Muscat but was unable to take the town. Instead he occupied the nearby port of Muttrah, attracting merchants to this port and thus depriving Saif bin Sultan II of revenue. Struggle with the Persians Saif bin Sultan II appealed to the Persians for help and promised to cede Sohar to them in exchange. Fresh from a victorious campaign in India, the Persian ruler Nader Shah dispatched an expedition of 6,000 men under Mirza Mohammed Taki Khan, which arrived at Julfar around October 1742. Saif bin Sultan II went by sea to Khor Fakkan and then traveled overland to meet the Persians. The officers of the ships at Khor Fakkan went over to Sultan bin Murshid, taking their ships to him at Muttrah. The Persians besieged Sohar and sent forces to Muscat, but were unable to take either place. In January 1743 they received reinforcements. They sent another force to attempt to take Muscat. Sultan bin Murshid, who was still based at Muttrah, deliberately abandoned Muscat, and the Persians entered the town. While they were engaged in plunder, Sultan bin Murshid attacked with the combined garrisons of Muttrah and Muscat, destroyed the Persian force and captured several ships. Death The Persians sent a fresh force by land, and succeeded in taking Muttrah. Sultan bin Murshid escaped to Sohar, where he was mortally wounded under the walls of the town in mid-1743. Some say that he killed himself. Bal'arab bin Himyar was elected Imam in his place. The Persians took Muscat and again attacked Sohar to the north. After enduring nine months of siege, the governor Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi negotiated an honorable surrender. Later he would drive the Persians from the country and establish a new dynasty of rulers of Oman.

The fibromas occur most frequently in animals under 2 years of age, with cases in older deer reported occasionally/rarely. Deer fibromas appear on the skin as hard and round tumors that can be as big as 1 cm in diameter. The tumors are blackish or brown and have a rough textured surface. They do not cause the animal harm unless clumps of fibromas interfere with breathing, eating, or walking. \\"Fibromas have been reported in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), fallow deer (Cervus dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer caribou).\\" They occur across the entirety of the white-tail deer's range. Clinical signs and symptoms The only visible sign of cutaneous fibroma in white-tailed deer are fleshy wart-like growths on the skin, which are likely caused by biting insects. These growths can vary from individual growths to clusters of warts. These warts can also vary in size from small to very large. Because these growths are only attached to the skin, not to the underlying muscle and bone, they actually have no physical effects on the deer itself. These tumors or warts may however impair the ability to see, eat, or run if they are large enough to inhibit normal behavior. Deer with these growths can still be in perfect health and will show no symptoms of ill health. Transmission The fibromas are most often caused by host- specific papillomaviruses. They may also be due to host-specific poxviruses. The transmission of cutaneous fibromas in the white-tailed deer is caused by a virus that is thought to be transmitted through a variety of insect bites or by a deer coming in contact with any contaminated object that scratches or penetrates the skin of the deer or contaminates wounded/damaged skin. Deer tend to frequent particular trails during their movements, and may thus potentially become infected by contact with objects on the path previously contaminated by other deer. As fibromas occur more commonly in bucks, the virus is probably often transmitted during sparring. This disease appears temporary, manifesting after about 7 weeks after inoculation and lasting only about two months. Cutaneous fibromas are not transmittable to other livestock or humans if the deer is consumed. Occurrence Fibromas occur most frequently in animals under two years of age. The tumor has been diagnosed in 2.1% of males and 0.4% of females. More bucks are shot (either by law or hunter preference), which influences the sampling. Treatment and control Treatment is not a feasible option for most wild populations. The disease has not been a problem in captive herds. The growths could be removed surgically if it became important, but that would rarely be an issue. Because exposure to the virus leads to immunity, it should be possible to develop a vaccine if prevention becomes necessary. To date, this disease has been too rare to justify such actions.  Prognosis  Large, ulcerated fibromas are infrequent. In most deer, the fibromas develop to only a few mm in diameter. Tumors then regress; this has been observed both in naturally occurring and experimentally induced cases. Only in an occasional deer do they develop into conspicuous skin tumors. Results of a New York survey indicated that wild deer are exposed and develop an immunity to the fibroma virus early in life. Significance Fibromatosis is not an important cause of deer mortality. The disease is not known to infect humans. Although they do not harm the meat, fibromas are repulsive to most people and therefore discourage them from consuming the deer. Some domesticated animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) are subject to \\"warts\\" common to their species. There is no reason to believe that fibromatosis of deer is infectious to non-deer domestic animals.

The first regular symposium was held in Annapolis on 27‚Äì28 April 1973, following a successful 1971 conference that had been conceived as an annual event and on a smaller scale with limited, invited participation. In 1977 for the Third Symposium, the Naval Academy History Department decided to expand the concept and model it along the lines of the academic conferences sponsored by the American Historical Association and the Organization of American HistoriansWilliam B.

It took four years for the Naval Academy's leadership to approve the resumption of the conference on a biennial schedule, but with strong support the series resumed with the Fifteenth Conference in 2007. Facilitating this, in 2006 the U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Foundation granted funds from the estate of Bill Daniels and the McMullen Seapower Lecture gift funds to support the symposium and to name it the McMullen Naval History Symposium in memory of Dr. John J. McMullen, Naval Academy Class of 1940, a naval architect, engineer, and sports club owner. Dr McMullen is also commemorated through a keynote McMullen Seapower lecture given at the symposium by the holder of the Class of 1957 Distinguished Chair of Naval Heritage.

Rule of Ya'arab bin Bel'arab Mohammed bin Nasir was the \\"Temeemeh\\" of the Beni Ghafir, a Nizar tribe. In 1720 Ya'Arab bin Bel'arab seized power in Oman, declaring himself regent during the minority of his cousin Saif bin Sultan II. In May 1722 Ya'Arab took the next step and proclaimed himself Imam. This caused an uprising led by Bel'arab bin Nasir, a relative by marriage of the deposed Imam. After some skirmishes, Ya'Arab bin Bel'arab was defeated at Nizwa and the young Saif bin Sultan II was again declared Imam, this time with Bela'rab bin Nasir as regent. Mohammed bin Nasir was among the notables who came to Rustaq to congratulate him. For some reason, Bel'arab bin Nasir picked a quarrel with Mohammed bin Nasir, who took steps to organize a rebellion in alliance with the former Imam Ya'Arab bin Bel'arab. Civil war In the fighting that followed Sheikh Mohammed bin Nasir proved to be a skilled commander. After a series of defeats, Bel'arab bin Nasir was forced to accept peace terms under which he would surrender all forts in Oman. Around this time Ya'Arab bin Bel'arab died on 16 March 1723 at Nizwa. Mohammed bin Nasir learned that the forts at Muscat and Barka were holding out under the leadership of Kalf bin Mubarak al-Hinawi. He imprisoned Bel'arab bin Nasir, and with a growing force of tribesmen advanced on Barka. Confused fighting followed, with Mohammed bin Nasir much stronger on land but Kalf having the advantage of sea power. Imam Mohammed bin Nasir gained the upper hand. In September 1724 he called a meeting of Sheikhs of Oman at which he declared his intent to withdraw from the struggle. As planned, he was asked to instead accept the position of Imam. Muhammad bin Nasir was elected Imam on 2 October 1724. His rival, Khalf bin Mubarak, stirred up trouble among the northern tribes. In an engagement at Sohar in 1728 both Khalf bin Mubarak and Muhammad bin Nasir were killed. The garrison of Sohar recognized Saif bin Sultan II as Imam, and he was re-installed at Nizwa. However, some of the inhabitants of Az Zahirah elected Saif's cousin Bal'arab bin Himyar as Imam.

This species has been the subject of numerous scientific studies on subjects ranging from ecology and evolution to neurobiology.  Ecology and environment  Found from central Baja California, Mexico to Alaska, USA along the Pacific coast of North America, T. californicus inhabits splash pools in rocky intertidal habitat. T. californicus is limited to pools in the upper end of the intertidal apparently by predation,Dethier, M. F. 1980 Tidepools as refuges: Predation and the limits of the harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, Volume 42, Issue 2, 22 January 1980, Pages 99-111. but it can reach quite high population densities in this habitat. One study found that population densities on Vancouver Island averaged about 800 copepods per liter with some dense pools having as many as 20,000 copepods per liter.Powlik. J. F. 1998 Seasonal Abundance and Population Flux of Tigriopus californicus (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) in Barkley Sound, British Columbia. J. Mar. Biol. Ass. UK. 78, 467-481. These splash pools are often isolated from the moderating influence of the ocean and therefore the pools can vary dramatically in environmental factors such as salinity and temperature over the course of hours or days. T. californicus has the ability to thrive under these variable environmental conditions (factors that limit predators such as fish to lower pools in the intertidal zone). Temperature in the pools that this copepod inhabits tend to track air temperatures more closely than ocean temperatures and salinities in pools can change as pools evaporate, receive freshwater inputs from rain, or saltwater from wave actions. The ability of T. californicus to handle extreme high temperatures varies among populations with southern California populations able to handle higher temperatures than those further north.Willett 2010 Potential fitness tradeoffs for thermal tolerance in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. Evolution 64: 2521-2534. This pattern of higher thermal tolerance in southern populations mirrors the temperature variation seen in copepod pools with southern populations experiencing more extreme high temperatures (over on occasion).Kelly, M. W., E. Sanford, and R. K. Grosberg Limited potential for adaptation to climate change in a broadly distributed marine crustacean. Proc. R. Soc. B. 2012 279 1727 349-356doi:10.1098/rspb.2011.0542 The genetic basis of this potential thermal adaptation has been studied by looking at genome-wide studies of gene expression and this study showed that differential expression of Hsp70 genes and a number of other genes could contribute to differences in thermal tolerance between these populations.Schoville, S. D., Barreto, F. S., Moy, G. W., Wolff, A. & Burton, R. S. (2012). Investigating the molecular basis of local adaptation to thermal stress: population differences in gene expression across the transcriptome of the copepod Tigriopus californicus, BMC Evolutionary Biology, 12:170. They have been known to have survived up to six months in laboratory conditions, however their longevity in natural conditions has yet to be determined.  Genetics and evolution  Populations of T. californicus along the Pacific coast of North America show a striking pattern of genetic differentiation among populations. Mitochondrial DNA shows particularly large divergences among populations often exceeding twenty percent total sequence divergence.Burton, R. S., R. J. Byrne & P. D. Rawson. 2007 Three divergent mitochondrial genomes from California populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Gene 403:53-59.Willett, C. S. and J. T. Ladner. 2009. Investigations of fine-scale phylogeography in Tigriopus californicus reveal historical patterns of population divergence. BMC Evolution. 9:139. Genetic divergence of a smaller magnitude extends down to a more local scale and this divergence can be stable for longer than two decades for outcrops that are as little as apart, suggesting that dispersal between outcrops must be relatively rare for this copepod.Burton, R. S. 1997. Genetic evidence for long term persistence of marine invertebrate populations in an ephemeral environment. Evolution 51:993-998. Surprisingly, genetic divergence is much lower among copepod populations from Washington north to Alaska suggesting that copepods may have recolonized these areas since the end of the last ice age.Edmands, S. 2001. Phylogeography of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus reveals substantially reduced population differentiation at northern latitudes. Molecular Ecology 10:1743-1750. Crosses of copepods from different populations of T. californicus have been used to study how reproductive isolation accumulates between diverging population to gain insights into the process of speciation. For crosses between many populations a pattern that has been called hybrid breakdown is observed; this means that first generation hybrids have high survival and reproduction (fitness), while the second generation hybrids have lower and more variable fitness.Edmands, S. 1999. Heterosis and outbreeding depression in interpopulation crosses spanning a wide range of divergence. Evolution 53:1757-1768. Deleterious interactions between the mitochondrial genome and nuclear genome may play a large role in the reduction in hybrid fitness observed in many of these crosses.Ellison, C. K. & R. S. Burton. 2008. Interpopulation hybrid breakdown maps to the mitochondrial genome. Evolution 62: 631-638. Sex determination in T. californicus does not appear to be caused by sex chromosomes and is likely to be polygenic, potentially influenced by environmental conditions. The ratios of males to females produced by females differs among families and in some families seems to be genetically determined largely by the father in a pair.Voordouw, M. J., Robinson H. E. & Anholt, B. R. (2005) , Paternal inheritance of the primary sex ratio in a copepod. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18: 1304‚Äì1314. Another interesting feature of the mating system of this species is that the males use their large clasping antennules to clutch females until they are ready to mate.Burton, R. S. (1985). Mating system of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, Marine Biology, 86:247-252. Females will mate only once during their lives but produce multiple clutches of offspring.  Physiology  This copepod species has also been used as a model system in which to look at some questions in animal physiology including both neurobiology and osmoregulation. In response to increasing or decreasing environmental salinities T. californicus changes the amount of amino acids within its cells to maintain water balance.Burton, R. S. & Feldman, M. W. (1982) Changes in free amino acid concentrations during osmotic response in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 73A, 441-445. The amino acid proline is subject to strict regulation in response to changes in salinity and this may be a common mechanism of osmoregulation across crustaceans.Burton, R. S. (1992) Proline synthesis during osmotic stress in megalopa stage larval of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Biol. Bull. 182, 409-415. For neurobiology, one study looked at the central nervous system of this copepod to get an idea of the organization of the central nervous system of the ancestors to the crustaceans and insects to complement the neurobiological work that has been done in a group of distantly related copepods (the calanoid copepods).Andrew, D. R., Brown, S. M. and Strausfeld, N. J. (2012), The minute brain of the copepod Tigriopus californicus supports a complex ancestral ground pattern of the tetraconate cerebral nervous systems. J. Comp.

Founded in 2007 by Jacob Blackstock, David Kennedy, Shahan Panth, Dorian Baldwin, and Jesse Brown. The company's web application, Bitstrips.com, allowed users to create comic strips using personalized avatars, and preset templates and poses. Brown and Blackstock explained that the service was meant to enable self-expression without the need to have artistic skills. Bitstrips was first presented in 2008 at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and the service later piloted and launched a version designed for use as educational software. The service achieved increasing prominence following the launch of versions for Facebook and mobile platforms. In 2014, Bitstrips launched a spin-off app known as Bitmoji, which allows users to create personalized stickers for use in messaging apps. In July 2016, Snap, Inc. announced that it had acquired the company; the Bitstrips comic service was shut down, but Bitmoji remains operational, and has subsequently been given greater prominence within Snapchat's overall platform.  History  Bitstrips was co-developed by Toronto-based comic artist Jacob Blackstock and his high school friend, journalist Jesse Brown. The service was originally envisioned as a means to allow anyone to create their own comic strip without needing artistic skills. Brown explained that \\"it's so difficult and time-consuming to tell a story in comic book form, drawing the same characters again and again in these tiny little panels, and just the amount of craftsmanship required. And even if you can do it well, which I never could, it takes years to make a story.\\" Brown stated that the service would be \\"groundwork for a whole new way to communicate\\", and went as far as describing the service as being a \\"YouTube for comics\\". Blackstock explained that the concept of Bitstrips was influenced by his own use of comics as a form of socialization; a student, Blackstock and his friends drew comics featuring each other and shared them during classes. He felt that Bitstrips was a \\"medium for self-expression\\", stating that \\"It's not just about you making the comics, but since you and your friends star in these comics, it's like you're the medium. The visual nature of comics just speaks so much louder than text.\\" The service was publicly unveiled at South by Southwest 2008. In 2009, the service introduced a version oriented towards the educational market, Bitstrips for Schools, which was initially piloted at a number of schools in Ontario. The service was praised by educators for being engaging to students, especially within language classes. Brown noted that students were using the service to create comics outside of class as well, stating that it was \\"so gratifying and shocking what people do with your tool to make their own stories in ways that you never would have anticipated. Some of them are just brilliant.\\" In December 2012, Bitstrips launched a version for Facebook; by July 2013, Bitstrips had 10 million unique users on Facebook, having created over 50 million comics. In October 2013, Bitstrips launched a mobile app; in two months, Bitstrips became a top-downloaded app in 40 countries, and over 30 million avatars had been created with it. In November 2013, Bitstrips secured a round of funding from Horizons Ventures and Li Ka- shing. In October 2014, Bitstrips launched Bitmoji, a spin-off app that allows users to create stickers featuring Bitstrips characters in various templates. In July 2016, following unconfirmed reports earlier in the year, Snap, Inc. announced that it had acquired Bitstrips. The company's staff continue to operate out of Toronto, but the original Bitstrips comic service was shut down in favour of focusing exclusively on Bitmoji. Following the acquisition, Snapchat's app was updated to integrate with Bitmoji, allowing users to link their accounts between the two apps and add Bitmoji to their posts. In September 2017, animated, 3D rendered Bitmoji were introduced to Snapchat's augmented reality \\"World Lenses\\" feature. Tuesday, August 18, 2020 Since the Snap acquisition, Bitmoji has seen significant growth; in April 2017, it was reported that Bitmoji was the most-downloaded app on the iOS App Store in Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In December 2017, Apple stated that Bitmoji was the most-downloaded iOS app worldwide in 2017, followed in second place by Snapchat itself. The following month, Bitmoji released an update branded as \\"Bitmoji Deluxe\\", which includes a wider array of customization options. In June 2018, Snap launched its development platform Snap Kit, which includes the ability to offer access to Bitmoji stickers within third-party services with a Snapchat connection. In April 2019, Snap announced a new multiplayer mobile game within the Snapchat app known as Bitmoji Party, where players use their Bitmoji characters in- game. Later that month, Snap announced a new software development kit for selected partners.

A. poinari is the first species of the ant genus Acanthognathus to have been described from fossils found in Dominican amber and is one of several species of Acanthognathus found in the Greater Antillies. History and classification Acanthognathus poinari is known from a solitary fossil insect which, along with six dipteran and a leaf section, is an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The specimens were collected from an undetermined amber mine in fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene the age range is only the youngest that it might be. The holotype amber specimen, number H-10-135, is currently preserved in the amber collections of noted amber researcher George Poinar, Jr., which at the time of description were housed in the University of California, Berkeley. The fossil was first studied by entomologists Cesare Baroni Urbani and Maria L. De Andrade of the University of Basle with their 1994 type description of the new species being published in the journal Transactions of the American Entomological Society. The specific epithet poinari is a patronym honoring George Poinar for his enthusiasm for amber which interested the authors into study of the specimens. Prior to the species formal description in 1994 the known distribution of the genus was confined to tropical Central and South America, ranging from Honduras south to Northern Argentina and Southeastern Brazil. Member species are active predators which use highly enlarged and modified trap-jaw mandibles.Acanthognathus teledectus mandibles  Description  The Acanthognathus poinari specimen is well preserved with an estimated body length of , including the enlarged mandibles. The overall coloration of A. poinari is a glossy reddish brown in general, which slightly lightens on the legs and antennae. The antennae are a distinct club shape with 2 joints. The mandibles and scape are slightly shorter than the head in combined length an host a number of sparse hairs. The gaster and petiole are smooth to very faintly punctate or striate, with the stria getting more distinct on the trunk. The head capsule shows distinct strong reticulation and patterning. A. poinari is separated from the living genera by the distinct transverse ornamentation found on the posterior cephalic angles.

The show featured two sitting Toronto politicians, mayor Rob Ford and his brother, city councillor Doug Ford Jr., and was pulled from the network after only one airing on November 18, 2013. An online version of the show aired on YouTube for five episodes between February and April, 2014. The title is a reference to the ardent, mainly suburban supporters of the Fords and their positive conservative goal.\\"Ford brothers planning web series after turning down reality show offers from ‚ÄòOprah and Dr. Phil,‚Äô Doug says,\\" from The National Post, 11/28/2013 Background From February 2012 to November 3, 2013, the Fords hosted The City, a weekly two- hour Sunday afternoon show on CFRB radio which Rob Ford described as \\"an unfiltered take on the work we do every day at Toronto City Hall.\\"\\"NEWSTALK 1010, Ford brothers agree to end weekly radio show,\\" from CTV Toronto, 11/8/2013 After months of controversy involving the mayor, criticism of the station for letting the Fords use the show as a \\"bully pulpit\\" where their political allies were promoted and opponents cut down, and complaints to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council alleging the show breached its code of ethics, CFRB announced in November 2013 that it and the Fords had \\"mutually determined\\" to end The City. On November 14, the brothers were tapped by Sun News Network to host a weekly pre-taped one-hour program on the TV network, to be titled Ford Nation. Content The lone airing of Ford Nation was broadcast on Monday, November 18, 2013, taking the 8PM (ET) slot normally occupied by Sun News Network's The Source with Ezra Levant. The format included a back-and-forth dialogue between Rob Ford and Doug Ford, with the former readmitting the personal mistakes he has made as mayor (\\"It is what it is. I've admitted to my mistakes.\\"). Segments included discussions with Levant and Toronto Sun columnist Joe Warmington. Levant's appearance included a commentary critical of the Toronto Star's investigations into Rob Ford, with Levant likening the media's treatment of the mayor over his recent controversies to the paparazzi's hounding of Princess Diana.\\"Ford Nation show sounds like a rerun throughout its Sun News Network debut,\\" from Canada.com, 11/18/2013 Cancellation and revival as web series On November 19, 2013, less than 24 hours after Ford Nation's debut, Sun News Network announced it was cancelling the program after just one episode. Sun News cited high production costs involved with the premiere episode; the show, taped one day before its airing, reportedly took five hours to record and an additional eight hours to edit. Additionally, the show met with advertiser resistance about being associated with the controversial politicians. Doug Ford, in a later conversation with The National Post, insisted that the brothers entered into the project with Sun with the understanding that Ford Nation was a \\"one- off\\" project, one that was not intended to evolve into prolonged status. Despite the show's expense and its immediate cancellation, Ford Nation's sole episode attracted an audience of 155,000 viewers for the original broadcast, plus an additional 45,000 for its replay on prime time in Western Canada and 65,000 downloads of the program online. The audience was, according to Sun News vice-president Kory Teneycke, \\"by far the most successful thing, from an audience perspective, the network has ever done,\\" topping a 2012 charity boxing match between Liberal MP Justin Trudeau and Conservative Senator Patrick Brazeau. Rob Ford's celebrity status had, according to Doug Ford, caught the eye of several reality television producers in both Canada and the United States. Councillor Ford stated that the brothers passed on those offers, but took an interest in suggestions by videographers for an online program that would retain the Ford Nation title and be posted weekly on YouTube. The program employed a format similar to what the Fords enjoyed on CFRB's The City, with the Fords \\"[getting] the message out\\" on various topics in a \\"professional, yet simple\\" presentation, with occasional interactions with guests and audiences. Councillor Ford announced the new show would be released on YouTube \\"before Christmas\\" 2013. A series of short videos of under 5 minutes in length was launched on YouTube on February 10, 2014. In one segment, Mayor Ford admitted lying about his drug use. Others were lighter in tone and included predictions for the Stanley Cup playoffs and other remarks. In the second video, Ford named 18 councillors he wanted defeated, offering his support to any campaign opposing them. Each weekly \\"episode\\" consisted of 3 to 5 short videos of 1 to 5 minutes in length. Comments were disabled; however, the brothers occasionally answered viewer emails in the segments. The National Post described the program as \\"a bizarro world version of Wayne's World\\". Five episodes of the web series aired, with some episodes broken up into several parts. No new episodes were filmed after April 2014 when Rob Ford entered rehab following the emergence of a second video of him smoking crack cocaine.

It was a modification of the clipper ship using a similar bow but with better cargo handling. It achieved a balance between speed and tonnage such that it made the wheat trade between California and Great Britain competitive with east coast grain trade via steam ship. It could make the trip between San Francisco and Liverpool in 100 days, despite rounding Cape Horn and crossing the equator twice. A more unusual name for the rig was shipentine.  History  The Sewalls had begun building very large Down Easters in 1869. Beginning with the launch of the Rappahannock, they built a series of 300 foot, 3,000 tonners. The Rappahannock was a full rigged 3-masted ship, and the Sewalls realized that at this size a fourth mast was needed to make the rig manageable. Subsequent vessels were rigged as 4-masted barks, with a fore-and-aft rigged fourth mast. These were at the limit of wooden ship size, and for this reason they switched to the British practice of building with steel. The after mast was called the jigger, and since it was fore-and-aft rigged like a bark's mizzen, these vessels were commonly called four masted barks.

Description Pityophthorus juglandis can easily be distinguished from other members of its genus. Curtis Utley, a researcher at Colorado State University, elaborates on these differences stating, \\"Among these differences there are the 4 to 6 concentric rows of asperities on the prothorax, usually broken and overlapping at the median line. The declivity at the end of the wing covers is steep, very shallowly bisulcate, and at the apex it is generally flattened with small granules.\\" The walnut twig beetles' small size is common for its genus. Adult beetles average between 1.5 to 1.9 millimeters in length. Although little is known about the life-cycle of the walnut twig beetle, during experimentation with the beetle in a controlled environment, the lifespan of one generation of walnut twig beetles was seven weeks after logs of black walnut, Juglans nigra, were harvested from the wild in May, marking what scientists think is the beginning of the feeding season of the walnut twig beetle. Gatherings of the beetle in sections of the walnut tree are known as galleries. The outward appearance of the walnut above these galleries seemed normal except for small beetle entrance holes. In later stages of decline, beetle entrance holes and galleries were found scattered every 2 to 5 centimeters, essentially crippling the tree. The walnut twig beetle is commonly associated with the fungus Geosmithia morbida that causes damage ranging from discoloration in some species of walnuts to mortality in others. \\"Thousand cankers disease\\" was given its name because of the magnitude of galleries and subsequent cankers created by the disturbance regime of walnut twig beetles and Geosmithia morbida. The black walnuts only survived for several years after the start of feeding by the walnut twig beetle. However other species of walnut that are more regenerative towards Geosmithia morbida allowed the walnut twig beetle to feed for longer.  Origin and subsequent spread of species  The walnut twig beetle was first recorded in 1928 in Arizona inhabiting the Arizona walnut tree, Juglans major. The movement of this insect from Arizona to the surrounding areas was recorded in 1959 in Los Angeles when the walnut twig beetle was collected from both the black walnut and the native southern California black walnut, Juglans californica. Recently the beetle and fungus have spread to areas of the United States with much colder climates. In Denver, Colorado during 2001 the first cases of black walnut mortality due to cankerous sores caused by the walnut twig beetle and the fungus, Geosmithia morbida, which the walnut twig beetle carries, were recorded, and by 2008 nearly all of the black walnuts in Denver, Colorado had been eliminated. A similar instance occurred during this same time period in Delta, a city nearly four hundred kilometers west of Denver. Bark beetles are a major natural disturbance in North American forests, in recent history affecting more area annually than fire does.  Association with Geosmithia morbida  The walnut twig beetle is not the first bark beetle to be associated with a species of Geosmithia. The deaths of black walnut trees associated with the walnut twig beetle are not caused by the beetle but instead Geosmithia morbida. The origin of Geosmithia morbida is not known, but experts strongly believe that its emergence is connected to the walnut tree beetle and the Arizona walnut tree, and was not caused by the transfer of the disease from another area but instead by an evolutionary change in a similar species of fungi that inhabited closely to where the beetle was first identified. The fungus and beetle have developed a symbiotic relationship in which the fungus allows itself to be eaten by the beetle in return for a ride to the fungus's next host. The walnut twig beetle's hard shell covers two wings, and because the beetle can fly, Geosmithia morbida is reliant on the walnut twig beetle to be spread across distances, making the fungus entomochoric, or completely dependent upon the walnut twig beetle for dispersal, and only found in habitats containing the beetle.  Human prevention of spread  Human intervention in disturbances related to tree extinction because of infectious disease or invasive wildlife has historically been costly and therefore limited at best. Pruning a tree is one way humans combat fungi spread by bark beetles, and has been the reported course of action to take when dealing with similar fungi such as the Dutch elm disease. Bark beetles usually feast on limbs no greater than in diameter, spreading Dutch elm disease to a place that is still manageable to prune. However, the walnut twig beetle is not limited to attacking the limbs. Because the beetle can attack the trunk, pruning is rendered useless. In 2010 an outbreak of both Geosmithia morbida and the walnut twig beetle was identified in the community of Knoxville, Tennessee, threatening over 27 million black walnuts in Tennessee alone. The establishment of quarantine in the area was enacted, denoting a most drastic need to stop the spread of the disease. Since then several other states have enacted an exterior state quarantine in order to stop the spread of these pests into their states. Currently the most successful cure for Geosmithia morbida is the insertion of sterile agar into the site of the infection. However, since the magnitude of the number of holes in one tree bored by the walnut tree beetle is so great, this method does not seem to be an effective solution either. Community officials claim that the best thing people can do is not transport firewood, limiting the human spread of the disease.

Hayu's mother Ratu Hemas requested Noto to help her daughter when she started attending college in the US. Notonegoro who was pursuing a graduate study in the US at that time, met the princess in New York and the romance began there. Since Hayu was the last one to get married, the wedding was arranged as a cultural event for the people in Yogyakarta. While the previous royal weddings only involved a parade of five royal horse carriages, Hayu's wedding had twelve horse carriages to transport all the member of the Royal Family of Yogyakarta. The wedding also manage to boost tourism in Yogyakarta which is a touristic destination in the first place. On 22 October 2013, Princess Hayu was officially married to Prince Notonegoro.

Born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Le Jeune grew up in Dinard in Brittany and later in England. After serving in the British Army in Africa and Italy during World War II, he moved to Ireland in 1950, where he was a regular art exhibiter at the Royal Hibernian Academy until a year before his death. Early life James George Le Jeune was born in Saskatoon, Canada on 24 May 1910. He was the son of Anthony Le Jeune, a musician, of English and French descent, and an Irish mother. His great uncle is the English Victorian artist/painter Henry Le Jeune. When he was two, his family moved to Dinard in Brittany where he attended a Christian Brothers School. He continued his education in a boarding school in Northampton, England. Career During his career, Le Jeune used oil, water-colour, pencil to paint portraits, landscapes, and seascapes. In the early 1930s, Le Jeune began training in art in Paris and later in London at Heatherley School of Fine Art and the Byam Shaw School of Art. He moved to the United States and attended the Art Students League in New York. Le Jeune also studied architecture at the London Polytechnic. When World War II broke out, Le Jeune served in the British Army in Africa and Italy. Following the end of the war, he worked as an architect,Jame Le Jeumne, Duke St Galleries, retrieved 26 December 2013 but he had not lost his interest in painting. In 1948, Le Jeune exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the same year he exhibited Fishermans Regatta at the Society of Marine Artists. In 1950, Le Jeune and his wife Pamela (n√©e Mocatta) moved to Ireland to Delgany in County Wicklow, where he practised as an Architect for a short time but gave this up to paint full-time. In 1951, aged 41, Le Jeune began exhibiting at The Royal Hibernian Academy and was a regular exhibitor there for the next 31 years until 1982. During the 1950s, the Le Jeunes had three daughters, one of whom went on to be a self-taught artist. His first one-man show was at the Victor Waddington Galleries in 1954. In 1956 he had an exhibition in the Little Theatre, Brown Thomas. Commenting on his Brown Thomas exhibit, The Dublin Magazine noted: \\"This artist's palette in landscape is inclined to be over- sombre; in his portraits on the other hand, his low tones give depth and background, and his subjects are almost startling in their truth and reality ‚Äì seen with a touch of humour which stops short of caricature.\\" In 1960, Le Jeune moved to his studio at 38 Baggot Lane in Dublin, Ireland, where he lived and worked until his death in 1983. Jimmy, as he was known locally, was a regular visitor at Searsons pub and The Waterloo on Baggot Street. A year after he opened his Dublin studio, Le Jeune was appointed an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA), an artist-based and artist-oriented institution in Ireland, founded in Dublin in 1823. From 1961 to 1972, he served as a member and became a full RHA member in 1973. During the late 1960s, Le Jeune opened an art studio in New York and divided his time for some years painting between the two cities. Le Jeune died in Blackrock, County Dublin in January 1983. Writing for the Irish Independent twenty-five years later in 2008, journalist Con Houlihan, commented on his friend, \\"James was what you might call a painters' painter: he was greatly respected by his fellows but not as well known to the public.

The father at first was a teacher in a Catholic school, later he became school principal in Budapest. Here Zolt√°n went in Esztergom to gimnazy and to seminary.  Study in Rome  He arrived in Rome in 1909. Here became a student of the Pontifical German-Hungarian Institute. The seminarians completed their theological studies in the Gregorian Pontifical University (Gregoriana). He spoke Latin, Italian, German, English and French well, and while he was in Rome he further perfected his Ancient Greek and Latin and knew a little Spanish and Slovak. Finally, he achieved a doctorate in philosophy 1912. At the same time, in 1913, he also gained a diploma in theology at the Gregorian University. He finished his Canon Law studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University and obtained a degree.  Priest and bishop  After his ordination in Innsbruck 28 October 1915 Cardinal J√°nos Csernoch (1912‚Äì1927), The Primate of Hungary, named Zolt√°n Meszl√©nyi pastoral assistant in Kom√°rom. Not long after he transferred him to Esztergom to fundamental services. Zolt√°n Meszl√©nyi had chronic heart and thyroid problems. However, he was cured during the period between 21 May and 28 June 1937. In that time the Apostolic Nuntiature in Hungary communicated to Cardinal Ser√©di that the nomination of Zolt√°n Meszl√©nyi as titular bishop of Sinope and coadjutor of Esztergom had been officially confirmed by Cardinal Domenico Tardini in Rome. The Episcopal ordination took place in the Basilica of Esztergom on 28 October 1937 ‚Äì his priestly ordination's 22nd anniversary. The ordination was presided by Cardinal Jusztini√°n Ser√©di. The new bishop's motto was \\"fidenter ac fideliter\\" (With confidence and fidelity). Zolt√°n Meszl√©nyi, chapter vicar, took over his office in very difficult circumstances. In the end, barely 12 days after the election, on 29 June 1950, bishop Zolt√°n Meszl√©nyi was detained. For a short time was held in the Budapest detention center and then they transferred him to the intern camp at Kistarcsa. Here he was separated from the other prisoners in a room with no windows where freezing temperatures in the winter and scorching temperatures in the summer made the prisoner's life unbearable. The official accusation against his person with all probability was \\"antidemocratic behavior\\". From this moment on nobody saw him again. Death Public and official hearing never took place. It is miraculous that some information managed to get out from the detention camp. From these bits of information we can construe what type of treatment this Servant of God was subject to, and what could have possibly caused his death. On 4 March 1951 he died. Beatification 10 March 2004 began the process of beatification. 31 October 2009 was his beatification in Esztergom. His holiday is 4 March.

The hammer and chisel may be substituted for any other tool that can take off layers of a rock to create a different feature on the rock. Within the climbing community this is an extremely controversial topic because it permanently modifies the natural features of a rock face. While in the past the practice was accepted or ignored, as more people have become climbers and environmental concerns have grown, there has been a trend against chipping. This process can also be referred to as \\"manufacturing\\" holds.  History  The process of chipping has been around since the first ascents of famous routes such as \\"Outer Limits\\" in 1971 and \\"The Nose\\" of El Capitan in Yosemite in 1958 when chipping was acceptable. Route manufacturing continued on through the clean climbing revolution of the 1970s where climbers moved away from outdated climbing technology, such as pitons, that damage rock to removable protection, such as nuts that do not damage the rock. Pitons are pins that are hammered into the rock, whereas nuts are small pieces of metal that fit into cracks and are removable. Manufacturing persisted on into the 1990s, especially in crags (an area that contains rock walls for climbing) in France. There are many instances of routes that are partially or even completely manufactured that were first put up in the mid 1990s in Europe. An example of this is L‚Äôautre C√¥t√© du Ciel in France which was almost completely chipped and drilled to the liking of climber Fred Roughling. As indoor rock climbing gyms spread across the world in the mid 1990s, chipping seemed to subside as climbers could now create interesting routes with no need to modify rock. Ethical controversy Once the mid 1990s had passed, the manufacturing of routes also began to subside as many climbers decided that it was a mistake to change the natural features of routes. In many crags, especially around the United States, chipping is not only frowned upon by the community but also illegal. This fact though does not stop practice in many areas. Proponents Even though it is generally accepted that chipping is a bad practice, some climbing areas allow it. Some climbers in areas such as Riggins, Idaho have accepted the use of chipping for the creation of new routes. Those who support chipping in these select few climbing areas accept this practice because the area's rock face is blank and climbs would be physically impossible without manufactured holds. The general consensus in these areas seems to be that the common belief against chipping is less important than having areas to climb. Opposition According to climbing community polls, the large majority of climbers have a negative view on chipping. In fact, some are so vehemently opposed that they state they would take violent action against an individual who was chipping. One of the main arguments against chipping is that as climbers try to push their limits and find harder routes to climb, chipped routes lower the difficulty and possibly ruin a route that could have been an interesting climb to a better climber. To some, like climbing guide book author Stewart Green, chipped routes reflect \\"egotism, selfishness, and mediocrity.\\" According to Dave Graham there is a limited amount of climbable rock in the world and that by manufacturing a route it is impossible to ever put the rock back to its natural state. Environmental issues As more climbers join the sport every year, the environmental impact of climbing increases. Without clean climbing practices, techniques such as chipping have been shown to possibly compromise areas where rock climbing takes place. In an effort to partake in this endeavor, the National Park Service educates those looking to climb on its properties about the negative impact that practices like chipping have on natural resources. Climbers are usually informed about these issues during the process of picking up national park permits. In the media In February 2013, an anonymous video of world class climber Ivan Greene was released. This video showed him chipping a climb on a boulder in the famous Gunks climbing crag in New York. Due to the release of this video, Ivan Greene was dropped by his sponsor Edelrid who publicly announced that they would be cutting all ties to him.

Mycologia 66:490-498 Phaeohyphomycosis is an uncommon infection, however the number of case reported has been increasing in recent years. Fungal melanin is thought to be a virulence factor. The outcome of antifungal treatment is poor, and mortality is almost 80%.Sanjay G.R., J.E. Patterson, D.DA. Sutton, R.Pullen, and M.G. Rinaldi. 2002. Disseminated phaeohyphomycosis:review of an emerging Mycosis. Clinical Infectious Disease 34:467-476. Phaeohyphomycosis has been attributed to more than 100 species and 60 genera of fungi over the past several decades. The pathogens are considered opportunistic. Almost all cases of widely disseminated infection have occurred in immunosuppressed patients. Clinical signs of phaeohyphomycosis=Wildlife Phaeohyphomycosis is found throughout the animal kingdom. From mollusks to humans, different strains of this fungus affect animals differently, based on how severely the fungus has infected the animal. The clinical signs depend on the species of animal that is infected as well as the strain of fungus it is infected with. This disease is usually found more often in stressed animals after removal from their habitat. Invertebrates Invertebrates, such as crabs and mollusks, show a variety of clinical signs. Crabs had increasingly weak motor control, especially in legs and claws, and were lethargic. They had poor balance and tetany, or muscle spasms, in the claws. Finally, they had tissue necrosis, which caused deterioration of the epidermis, connective tissue, heart, hepatopancreas, nervous system, and gills. In severe cases, there was congestion of hemal sinuses, two principal empty areas along the digestive tube and vessels. Mass amounts of yeast-like cells compressed nerve fibers and the gill lamellae were destroyed. Mollusks clinical signs vary from scattered spots of brownish discoloration on the mantle tissues to general deterioration of mussel condition. In severe cases, there were black-bodied mussels with a distinct odor and black yeast-cells infected the connective tissues around the gonads and the digestive tract.Seyedmousavi, S., J. Guillot and G. S. de Hoog. 2013. Phaeohyphomycoses, emerging opportunistic diseases in animals. Clinical Microbiology Reviews 26:19-35. Cold-blooded vertebrates Cold-blooded vertebrates exhibited an assortment of clinical signs. Amphibians showed signs of anorexia. Ulcers or nodules in the skin were found, as well as swelling and lesions of internal organs, including the spleen, liver, and kidney. In extreme cases, neurological disorders and multifocal dermatitis (swelling caused by irritation of the fungus) occurred. Fish demonstrated signs of lethargy and disoriented swimming. There were ulcerative lesions, multiple dark foci in the gills, and non-ulcerative dermal masses found. In critical cases, some fish showed a variety of inflammatory responses including the formation of microabscesses. Lesions in the brain and kidneys were also found. These fish had abnormal swimming behavior, bulging eyes, and abdominal swelling. Warm- blooded vertebrates From birds to equines, Phaeohyphomycosis persists and has a massive range of clinical signs throughout differing species. Poultry and wild birds had neurological disorders and a loss of movement control. They experienced severe torticollis, which are severe muscle spasms that compromise the bird‚Äôs ability to hold up its head. The birds exhibited a loss of balance due to the rigidity of their legs. Cats showed signs of difficulty breathing due to excessive swelling of the nose. There were also lesions found throughout the body, including the brain. Common lesions include ulcerated cutaneous nodules of the digits, pinnae, nasal planum, and nasal/paranasal tissues. In extreme cases dogs exhibited vision impairment and had deep infections in the nasal cavity, kidneys, and the cerebellum. In dogs, brain infections were found similar to infections that were found in humans. Other clinical signs were lesions, abscesses, and severe inflammation throughout the dog‚Äôs body. Ruminants and equines were affected the same way from Phaeohyphomycosis. They showed respiratory distress through constant coughing and a fever. They demonstrated signs of anorexia, lethargy, and hypothermia. There was inflammation, hair loss, scaling, and damage to their cerebellum. Humans Human‚Äôs clinical signs consisted of swelling and eye infections. There were nodules underneath the skin, abscesses or cysts,. Hasei, M., K. Takeda, K. Anazawa, A. Nishibu, H. Tanabe, and T.

There were papules, plaques and granulomatous damages on the body. In extreme cases there were deep infections within the eyes, bones, heart and central nervous system.Bossler, A. D., S. S. Richter, A. J. Chavez, S. A. Vogelgesang, D. A. Sutton, A. M. Grooters, M. G. Rinaldi, G. S. de Hoog, and M. A. Pfaller. 2003. Exophiala oligosperma causing olecranon bursitis. Journal of Clinical Microbiology 41:4779-4782. Treatment Extensive treatments have been used on domestic animals more than on wild animals, probably because infected domestic animals are easier to identify and treat than infected wildlife. Treatment plans and management vary across taxa because this disease tends to affect each species differently. Antifungal drugs are the first line of defense to kill the agents causing phaeohyphomycosis, but despite the significant progress made in the last two decades and a 30% increase in available antifungal drugs since 2000, many drugs are not effective against black fungi. Diseases caused by black fungi are hard to treat because the fungi are very difficult to kill. This high resilience may be contributed to the presence of melanin in their cell walls, as well as the greater similarity to host cells which are both eukaryotes than other pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. Current antifungal agents the fungi are not resistant to are posaconazole, voriconazole, and azole isavuconazole. In 2006, a free-living Eastern box turtle, Terrapene carolina carolina, was found with a form of phaeohyphomycosis and was brought in the Wildlife Center of Virginia.Janovsky, M., A. Gr√∂ne, D. Ciardo, J. V√∂llm, A. Burnens, R. Fatzer, and L.N. Bacciarini. 2006. Phaeohyphomycisis in a snow leopard Uncia uncia due to Cladophialophora bantiana. Journal of Comparative Pathology 134: 245-248. Its symptom was swelling of the right hindfoot; it was diagnosed as having chromomycosis by histopathology. The center provided a series of antimicrobial treatments and a one-month course of 1 mg itraconazole, administered orally once a day. The eastern box turtle was euthanized due to further complications and the caretakers‚Äô belief that the turtle would not be able to survive if placed back in the wild. A recent case of a form of phaeohyphomycosis infection was found in a dog in 2011.Bently, R.T., D. Faissler, and J. Sutherland-Smith. 2011. Successful management of an intracranial phaeohypomycotic fungal granuloma in a dog. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 239:480-485. The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association published a case study in which researchers successfully managed an intracranial phaeohyphomycotic fungal granuloma in a one-year-old male Boxer dog. Veterinarians of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at Tufts University surgically removed the granuloma in the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient was treated with fluconazole for 4 months, and was followed with voriconazole for 10 months. Both are medications used to treat fungal infections. Based on magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis 8 months after the surgery, the male Boxer‚Äôs outcome was considered excellent. Emphasis has been placed on how to manage this disease through careful management practices including: proper handling, preventing crowding situation with animals, and transportation. Both the animals and the environment should be treated thoroughly to hinder the spread and control the fungal infection. This is especially important since humans can also contract this disease. Research projects and implications Phaeohyphomycosis is a disease caused by this fungus. If given the opportunity, this disease can spread to the brain and cause a painful death. There have been multiple reports of this host of fungi, but by the time the disease is recognized, it is usually too late for the animal to be successfully treated. Recent searches of databases show that there are no current projects studying the spread of this fungus in wild animals, though there are documented cases of its occurrence. In 2005, a five- month-old snow leopard (Uncia uncia) in Europe was diagnosed with phaeohyphomycosis due to Cladophalophora bantiana. This fungus caused spastic paralysis as well as the inability to defecate or urinate. Because of this finding, more researchers are aware of this disease and the fact that it does not just infect the brain, as previously thought, but also other organs and other parts of the nervous system.Janovsky, M., A. Gr√∂ne, D. Ciardo, J. V√∂llm, A. Burnens, R. Fatzer, and L.N. Bacciarini. 2006. Phaeohyphomycisis in a snow leopard (Uncia uncia) due to Cladophialophora bantiana. Journal of Comparative Pathology 134: 245-248. A Purdue University study in 2011 showed a Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos) with the same fungus affected by cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. The eight-year-old animal was the first report of this disease in a camelid ruminant.Frank, C., R. Vemulapalli, and T. Lin. 2011. Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis due to Cladophialophora bantiana in a Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos). Journal of Comparative Pathology 145:410-413. Conclusively, phaeohyphomycosis is a highly prolific disease that is caused by multiple genera of fungi. The disease is transmissible through several mediums, including air, wind, and water. Both individual animals and whole populations can be affected by it. Although it does not seem to be an epidemic, it is nonetheless an area of concern and requires much more active research rather than simply reports of terminal or already-dead animals.

It was Rockford's largest brewery for almost seventy years.  Origin  British immigrant Jonathan Peacock moved to Rockford, Illinois in 1849. Peacock had learned the brewing trade in England before working in Chicago's Lill & Diversey brewery. He purchased a house on Madison Street and began to brew beer in the back. Peacock ground malt in a coffee mill, brewed it in a wash boilers, and delivered his product to customers via wheelbarrow. With the connection of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad to Rockford in 1852, Peacock was ready to serve the droves of immigrants that followed. By 1857, Peacock's operation had grown to a point where he could no longer simply brew out of the back of his home. He built a new brewhouse next door to meet demand. In the summer of 1894, a fire ravaged the brewhouse. Peacock immediately rebuilt, but died two years later. His sons, Frank and Edward, inherited the business. Under their leadership, the brewery produced over 20,000 barrels of beer per year. The most popular beer was Nikolob. Both sons died of tuberculosis in 1899, and the brewery was sold to Croatian immigrant John V. Petritz.  1900s  John Petritz had moved out west to Montana in the 1880s and made a fortune in liquor production and distribution. After he decided to move back east, he decided to purchase a large brewery. With the Peacock Brewery under his ownership, he hired St. Louis architects Widmann, Walsh & Boisscher to design a large, modern brewhouse. Replacing the older brewhouse, the $100,000 brewhouse had state-of-the-art technology and advanced production to 75,000 barrels a year. Petritz renamed the company the Rockford Brewing Company. He purchased a bottling company in 1900, replacing it with a newer building in 1902.  Prohibition  Petritz struggled to keep up with new liquor license and tax laws in the early 20th century. By 1916, he had accrued 270 violations and faced fines exceeding $2,000. In 1917, Winnebago County passed a law enforcing prohibition. Petritz ignored the law and continued to produce beer at his brewhouse. John V. Petritz, his son Frank, and manager Earl Blewfeld were arrested that year for the violations. Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Kenesaw Mountain Landis oversaw the trial, which became a local media sensation. Petritz was forced to pay a combined $15,000 to the city and county in a settlement for 1,250 violations of liquor laws. The license for the Rockford Brewing Company expired in 1918 and was not renewed.  Rock River Brewing Company  Petritz used the old brewing buildings to start a new warehousing business. Another one of his sons, John G., tried to restart the brewery after prohibition ended. Sold under the name Petritz, the beer was produced in Chicago and bottled in the Rockford buildings. One of his partners, Samuel Hirsch, bought out the other partners in 1937 and changed the name to the Rock River Brewing Company. Producing Coronet Old Vat and Grand Prize beers, the brewery finally came to a closure in 1945.  2000s  On November 22, 2011, the brewery buildings were recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. It was highlighted as the featured property of the week. Today, the building is undergoing renovation towards being reopened as Rockford Brewery in spring 2014. The Ice Cellar Bar, one of three event rooms has been updated with a 10-line draft system and changeable colored LED lights set into he base of the copper lined bar. The lighting overhead is now renovated to LED lights shine through a surface that resemble the blocks of ice once stored in this room. The overhead lights are made from ancient beer and liquor bottles, many produced here originally. The bar's copper lining is the same aged color as the copper vats once used in the brewing process. The beams and bar supports are raw steel as was commonly used in the industrial age. References .

In its strongest, unqualified form, the principle of wholistic reference is the proposition that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its non-logical or content terms, refers to the whole of its universe of discourse. According to this principle every proposition of number theory, even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers. The relation verb ‚Äòrefers‚Äô is being used in its broad sense (loosely ‚Äúis about‚Äù) and not as a synonym for ‚Äònames‚Äô in the sense of ‚Äúis a name of‚Äù. George Boole (1815‚Äì1864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854,Corcoran, John, and Sag√ºillo, Jos√© Miguel, 2011. ‚ÄúThe Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper‚Äù, History and Philosophy of Logic 32: 359‚Äì80. he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference. Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity ‚Äì or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically ‚Äì was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43.George Boole. 1854/2003. The Laws of Thought. Facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in Philosophy in Review 24 (2004): 167‚Äì169. One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section. Similar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including Gottlob Frege (1848‚Äì1925). Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.Corcoran, John.

In 1989 he won the chess festival in Bad W√∂rishofen ahead of Tony Miles and Lucas Brunner. A major success was his first place at the Vidmar Memorial Zonal tournament in Ptuj 1995.The World Chess Championship Zonals 1995-1997 Mark Weeks, www.mark-weeks.com He thus qualified for the FIDE World Chess Championship 1998 knock-out tournament, where he was eliminated in the second round by GM Gilberto Milos from Brazil. Kindermann represented Germany in six Chess Olympiads from 1982 to 1994 and scored 33 points in 56 games. In 2005 he transferred to the Austrian Chess Federation and represented Austria at the Chess Olympiads in Dresden 2008, and Istanbul 2012. His best results were at the 26th Chess Olympiad 1984 and the 28th Chess Olympiad 1988 both held in Thessaloniki, Greece where he scored 7.5/11 both times, and finished 4th and 6th respectively on board 3 for Germany.Stefan Kindermann Chess Olympiad results, www.olimpbase.org He also represented Germany in the European Team Chess Championship twice in 1983 and 1989, and represented Austria two times in 2009 and 2011. He won a team bronze medal and finished fourth on board 4 at the event in Haifa 1989.Stefan Kindermann European Team Chess Championship Results, www.olimpbase.org Stefan Kindermann appeared on Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) television, playing in series eight of the BBC's The Master Game Tournament in 1983.Pfleger, Helmut; Kurz, Eugen. \\"Turnier der Schachgro√ümeister '83\\" (Falken-Verlag, 1983). Kindermann has played in the German Chess Bundesliga for many years and his team FC Bayern Munich has won the German Team championship nine times. Since 2009 he has been playing for the Munich club MSA Zugzwang. In the Austrian Bundesliga he plays for Merkur Graz and Sparkasse Jenbach. He is the author of several chess books, including a book on the French Winawer Variation (together with Ulrich Dirr, 2001, ), the Leningrad Dutch (2002, ) and the Spanish Exchange Variation (2005, ). Between 2000 and 2003 he worked for the chess publisher Chessgate. He also writes a weekly chess column for the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. In 2010, together with Robert K. von Weizs√§cker, he published the book The King plan. Strategies for your Success (). This explains strategic models, developed from chess strategies, in the form of keynote speeches and seminars for executives. An endgame study, composed by him in the Timman 50 Tourney in 2002, for the 50th birthday of Jan Timman, won first prize. The competition included 95 study composers from 23 countries.Open Chess Diary 180: 7 July 2002: Unstoppable stalemates, Tim Krabb√©  Personal life  Kindermann, graduated in 1996 with a Master of Neuro-linguistic programming, and also works as a personal coach and trainer.

The film follows a baseball fan, named Mr. Brown, who drinks large quantities of alcohol before a baseball game and becomes so intoxicated that the game appears to him in reverse motion. During production, trick photography was used to achieve this effect. The film was released in November 1907. It received positive reviews in a 1908 issue of The Moving Picture World, a film journal, that reported the film was successful and \\"truly funny.\\" it is unclear whether a print of the film has survived. The identities of the film's cast and production crew are not known. Film historians have noted similarities between the plot of How Brown Saw the Baseball Game and the Edwin S. Porter-directed comedy film How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game released the previous year. Plot Before heading out to a baseball game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home by one of his friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.; Production Siegmund Lubin in 1913. His company produced and distributed How Brown Saw the Baseball Game. How Brown Saw the Baseball Game was produced by Lubin Manufacturing Company, a company founded by German-American film pioneer Siegmund Lubin. At the time How Brown Saw the Baseball Game was made, the company was creating and distributing up to three films a week. The identities of How Brown Saw the Baseball Games director and cast are not known. It is a silent film shot in black and white, and the finished product comprised of film. For the scenes which took place at the ballpark, the filmmakers used a form of trick photography in order to show the baseball players running backwards. Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film, under the alternate title How Jones Saw the Baseball Game, on October 26, 1907. Release and reception How Brown Saw the Baseball Game was released into theaters by Lubin Manufacturing Company on November 16, 1907, and was still being shown as late as August 1908. During this time, the film sometimes was presented as part of a double feature with the 1907 film Neighbors Who Borrow, a short comedy film about a man who lends nearly everything he owns to his neighbors until his wife returns home and berates him for doing so. Advertisements for the film touted it as \\"such fun\\", and Lubin himself promoted the film as a \\"screamingly funny farce\\". It received a positive review in the June 1908 issue of The Moving Picture World which described the film as \\"truly funny\\" and that it proved to be \\"a veritable success\\". Modern writings have often suggested that How Brown Saw the Baseball Game was produced as Lubin Manufacturing Company's alternative to the Edwin S. Porter- directed comedy How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game, a film released by Edison Studios in 1906 about an office employee sneaking out of his workplace to watch a baseball game only to discover his employer in a nearby seat. Lubin Manufacturing Company was known for creating films similar to competing motion pictures made by other studios. Lubin had previously created films resembling Edison Studios' releases Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Great Train Robbery. Author Jack Spears wrote in his book Hollywood: The Golden Era that How Brown Saw the Baseball Game and How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game \\"used practically the same plot\\"; Rob Elderman's article \\"The Baseball Film: to 1920\\" in the journal Base Ball likewise notes the similarities of their plotlines. , it was unclear whether there is a surviving print of How Brown Saw the Baseball Game; it has likely become a lost film.

Each dish holds experimental trees grown from lab-cultured cells to which researchers have given new genes. Source: USDA. A genetically modified tree (GMt, GM tree, genetically engineered tree, GE tree or transgenic tree) is a tree whose DNA has been modified using genetic engineering techniques. In most cases the aim is to introduce a novel trait to the plant which does not occur naturally within the species. Examples include resistance to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, and herbicide tolerance, or the alteration of lignin levels in order to reduce pulping costs. Genetically modified forest trees are not yet approved (\\"deregulated\\") for commercial use, with the exception of insect-resistant poplar trees in China. and one case of GM Eucalyptus in Brazil. Several genetically modified forest tree species are undergoing field trials for deregulation, and much of the research is being carried out by the pulp and paper industry, primarily with the intention of increasing the productivity of existing tree stock. Certain genetically modified orchard tree species have been deregulated for commercial use in the United States including the papaya and plum. The development, testing and use of GM trees remains at an early stage in comparison to GM crops.  Research  Research into genetically modified trees has been ongoing since 1988. Concerns surrounding the biosafety implications of releasing genetically modified trees into the wild have held back regulatory approval of GM forest trees. This concern is exemplified in the Convention on Biological Diversity's stance: A precondition for further commercialization of GM forest trees is likely to be their complete sterility. Plantation trees remain phenotypically similar to their wild cousins in that most are the product of no more than three generations of artificial selection, therefore, the risk of transgene escape by pollination with compatible wild species is high. One of the most credible science-based concerns with GM trees is their potential for wide dispersal of seed and pollen. The fact that pine pollen travels long distances is well established, moving up to 3,000 kilometers from its source. Additionally, many tree species reproduce for a long time before being harvested. In combination these factors have led some to believe that GM trees are worthy of special environmental considerations over GM crops. Ensuring sterility for GM trees has proven elusive, but efforts are being made. While tree geneticist Steve Strauss predicted that complete containment might be possible by 2020, many questions remain.  Proposed uses  GM trees under experimental development have been modified with traits intended to provide benefit to industry, foresters or consumers. Due to high regulatory and research costs, the majority of genetically modified trees in silviculture consist of plantation trees, such as eucalyptus, poplar, and pine.  Lignin alteration  Several companies and organisations (including ArborGenGenetically modified low-lignin eucalyptus yields twice the sugar, GLBRC,Poplars ‚Äúdesigned for deconstruction‚Äù a major boon to biofuels , ...) in the pulp and paper industry are interested in utilizing GM technology to alter the lignin content of plantation trees (particularly eucalyptus and poplar treesResearchers design trees that make it easier to produce pulp). It is estimated that reducing lignin in plantation trees by genetic modification could reduce pulping costs by up to $15 per cubic metre. Lignin removal from wood fibres conventionally relies on costly and environmentally hazardous chemicals. By developing low-lignin GM trees it is hoped that pulping and bleaching processes will require fewer inputs, therefore, mills supplied by low-lignin GM trees may have a reduced impact on their surrounding ecosystems and communities. However, it is argued that reductions in lignin may compromise the structural integrity of the plant, thereby making it more susceptible to wind, snow, pathogens and disease, which could necessitate pesticide use exceeding that on traditional plantations. This has proven correct, and an alternative approach followed by the University of Columbia was developed. This approach was to introduce chemically labile linkages instead (by inserting a gene from the plant Angelica sinensis ), which allows the lignin to break down much more easy.Monolignol Ferulate Transferase Introduces Chemically Labile Linkages into the Lignin Backbone Due to this new approach, the lignin from the trees not only easily breaks apart when treated with a mild base at temperatures of 100 degrees C, but the trees also maintained their growth potential and strength.Genetically Modified Trees Could Clean Up Paper Industry  Frost tolerance  Genetic modification can allow trees to cope with abiotic stresses such that their geographic range is broadened. Freeze-tolerant GM eucalyptus trees for use in southern US plantations are currently being tested in open air sites with such an objective in mind. ArborGen, a tree biotechnology company and joint venture of pulp and paper firms Rubicon (New Zealand), MeadWestvaco (US) and International Paper (US) is leading this research. Until now the cultivation of eucalyptus has only been possible on the southern tip of Florida, freeze- tolerance would substantially extend the cultivation range northwards.  Reduced vigour  Orchard trees require a rootstock with reduced vigour to allow them to remain small. Genetic modification could allow the elimination of the rootstock, by making the tree less vigorous, hence reducing its height when fully mature. Research is being done into which genes are responsible for the vigour in orchard trees (such as apples, pears, ...).  Accelerated growth  In Brazil, field trials of fast growing GM eucalyptus are currently underway, they are set to conclude in 2015‚Äì2016 with commercialization to result. FuturaGene, a biotechnology company owned by Suzano, a Brazilian pulp and paper company, has been leading this research. Stanley Hirsch, chief executive of FuturaGene has stated: \\"Our trees grow faster and thicker. We are ahead of everyone. We have shown we can increase the yields and growth rates of trees more than anything grown by traditional breeding.\\" The company is looking to reduce harvest cycles from 7 to 5.5 years with 20-30% more mass than conventional eucalyptus. There is concern that such objectives may further exacerbate the negative impacts of plantation forestry. Increased water and soil nutrient demand from faster growing species may lead to irrecoverable losses in site productivity and further impinge upon neighbouring communities and ecosystems. Researchers at the University of Manchester's Faculty of Life Sciences modified two genes in poplar trees, called PXY and CLE, which are responsible for the rate of cell division in tree trunks. As a result, the trees are growing twice as fast as normal, and also end up being taller, wider and with more leaves.Gene manipulation boosts tree growth rate and size  Disease resistance  Ecologically motivated research into genetic modification is underway. There are ongoing schemes that aim to foster disease resistance in trees such as the American chestnut (see Chestnut blight) and the English elm (see Dutch elm disease) for the purpose of their reintroduction to the wild. Specific diseases have reduced the populations of these emblematic species to the extent that they are mostly lost in the wild. Genetic modification is being pursued concurrently with traditional breeding techniques in an attempt to endow these species with disease resistance.Powell, William (March 2014) \\"the American Chestnut's Genetic Rebirth\\", Scientific American, Volume 310, Number 3, Page 52  Current uses = Poplars in China  In 2002 China's State Forestry Administration approved GM poplar trees for commercial use. Subsequently, 1.4 million Bt (insecticide) producing GM poplars were planted in China. They were planted both for their wood and as part of China's 'Green Wall' project, which aims to impede desertification. Reports indicate that the GM poplars have spread beyond the area of original planting and that contamination of native poplars with the Bt gene is occurring. There is concern with these developments, particularly because the pesticide producing trait may impart a positive selective advantage on the poplar, allowing it a high level of invasiveness.

It was dedicated to Saint Alban, the first English Christian martyr. The building, which is Grade II* listed, is still owned by the Church of England but is now leased to the Landmark Arts Centre for use as a venue for concerts and exhibitions. History In 1683 Charles Duncombe acquired a property opposite the parish church of St Mary's Teddington from The Marquis of Winchester, and named it Teddington Place. The church was built directly opposite St Mary's Church, on part of the grounds of Teddington Place. The house, renamed Udney Hall, was torn down in 1946. The site is now the location of Udney Hall Gardens. The foundation stone of the new church was laid in 1887. The design of the new church, which was built in 1889 and consecrated in 1896, was commissioned by its first vicar, Rev. Francis Leith Boyd, who had been appointed as Vicar of Teddington in 1884 when he was 28, officiating at the parish church of St Mary. It was designed in the French Gothic style by local architect William S Niven. Niven's name is engraved on the external wall at the west end of the south aisle wall. Most of the stonework is in Doulting limestone from near Shepton Mallet, Somerset. The finer grain material used internally in partitions is Corsham limestone from Wiltshire. The internal fittings were by A H Skipworth. The location of the pulpit, halfway down the nave, follows the French style. Its simple canopy was replaced in 1902 by a design in carved oak, embellished by gilded representations of three orders of angels. The window on the eastern side of the north transept, featuring Jonah and the Whale, was designed by Charles Eamer Kempe and was modelled on a window in Christ Church, Oxford. Four more windows were installed in 1953. The window on the west wall was made in about 1850 by Ward and Hughes and had been originally installed in St Peter‚Äôs Church, Islington. Rescued in 1987 by the London Stained-Glass Repository of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass, it was dismantled and re-leaded for installation here in 1992. The congregation had attempted to build a massive church, based on the Notre Dame de Paris and, though never designated as a cathedral, St Alban‚Äôs was known informally as \\"the Cathedral of the Thames Valley\\". Funds ran short, and a planned tower was never built. a wall, intended to be temporary, was placed at the west end. Also, the nave is shorter than in the original design. Stained glass windows inside the church In 1967 the church congregation reverted across the road to the historic but much smaller church of St Mary's. The building ceased to be used in 1977 and sat empty and vandalised for several years. In 1985 the video for the song \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\", by the Norwegian pop band A-ha, was filmed in the church building. It also featured in a 1997 episode of Crime Traveller. Local residents, including Jean Brown (who started the campaign and later became President of the Landmark Arts Centre, holding that post until her death in 2011) and Irene Sutton, secretary of the Friends of St Alban's, campaigned to save the deconsecrated church and to establish it as a local community and arts centre. In 1993 the temporary wall was replaced with a permanent one as part of the adaptation of the building for its new use. The building today The building is now operated by the Landmark Arts Centre, an independent charity, which delivers a wide-ranging arts and education programme for the local and wider community. Its activities include arts classes, concerts and exhibitions. In addition to its classes and events, the Centre is open to general visitors on weekdays from 9.30am to 12.30pm and a number of surviving architectural features can be seen.

It is on the Schneckenberg hill just outside Friedrichsruh in northern Germany. Bismarck was the first Chancellor of Germany (1871‚Äì1890). The chapel is now a protected monument. Description In the upper part of the chapel is the grave of Otto von Bismarck. The epitaph is in his own words: \\"A faithful German servant of Emperor Wilhelm I.\\" In the lower part, which is not accessible to the public, is the place of the family grave of the Bismarcks. His son, Herbert von Bismarck, and grandson, Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck, along with their wives, are laid to rest there. In the area around the chapel lies the grave of another grandson, Gottfried Graf von Bismarck-Sch√∂nhausen. The chapel and the site are still owned by the Bismarck family, but can be visited and rented for private tours. History Under the Gastein Convention negotiated by Bismarck in 1865, Prussia obtained the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg from the Austrian Empire. When Prussia established the German Empire in 1871, Bismarck was awarded the Saxony Forest as an endowment by Emperor Wilhelm I. Bismarck built his retirement home there, next to the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg Railway. He chose the site so that when he died he could be carried in state from his manor house down the railway to the mausoleum.Prussian newspaper of 20 March, 2004 (in German) Initially, Wilhelm II considered entombing Bismarck in the royal crypt of Berlin Cathedral. The poet Theodor Fontane argued against this, with his poem \\"Wo Bismarck liegen soll\\" (\\"Where Bismarck should lie\\"), which appeared in the newspaper on 3 August 1898, four days after Bismarck's death. Half a year after his death, on 16 March 1899, the coffins of Otto von Bismarck and his wife, who had been buried at the Bismarck estate in Varzin, Pomerania (now Warcino, Poland), were ceremonially interred in two marble sarcophagi in the Friedrichsruh chapel. This date was chosen because it was the 11th anniversary of the funeral of Kaiser Wilhelm I. The funeral was attended by Wilhelm II, with his wife and a large entourage.

Over a period of several centuries, female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake, sometimes alive, for a range of activities including coining and mariticide. While men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake, those who committed high treason were instead hanged, drawn and quartered. The English jurist William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing, although \\"full as terrible to the sensation as the other\\", could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman's body. Public executions were well-attended affairs, and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the pyre as they were burned alive. It later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict, and for the body to be burned post-mortem. In the latter half of the eighteenth century, changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament. His bill, by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women, led to the Treason Act 1790, which abolished the sentence. Crimes punishable by burning=Treason Portrait of William Blackstone (1774) by Thomas Gainsborough. Blackstone thought that rather than being hanged, drawn and quartered, women were burned to preserve their decency. By the end of the 13th century, several offences against either one's lord, or one's king, were treasonable. High treason, defined as transgressions against the sovereign, was first codified during King Edward III's reign by the Treason Act 1351. It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason, following earlier, somewhat \\"over zealous\\" interpretations of England's legal codes. For instance, high treason could be committed by anyone found to be compassing the king's death or counterfeiting his coin. High treason remained distinct though, from what became known as petty treason: the killing of a lawful superior, such as a husband by his wife. Though 12th century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason, enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary felony. As the most egregious offence an individual could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, \\"to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive\\", was \\"full as terrible to the sensation as the other\\". Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as \\"the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies\\". However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that \\"the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness\\", may, in the opinion of historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is \\"misconceived\\". In The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could \\"elicit obscene fantasies\\" from watching males. Heresy Another law enforceable by public burning was De heretico comburendo, introduced in 1401 during the reign of Henry IV. It allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy, thought to be \\"sacrilegious and dangerous to souls, but also seditious and treasonable.\\" Bishops were empowered to arrest and imprison anyone suspected of offences related to heresy and, once convicted, send them to be burned \\"in the presence of the people in a lofty place\\". Although the act was repealed in 1533/34, it was revived over 20 years later at the request of Queen Mary I who, during the Marian persecutions, made frequent use of the punishment it allowed. De heretico comburendo was repealed by the Act of Supremacy 1558, although that act allowed ecclesiastical commissions to deal with occasional instances of heresy. Persons declared guilty, such as Bartholomew Legate and Edward Wightman, could still be burned under a writ of de heretico comburendo issued by the Court of Chancery. The burning of heretics was finally ended by the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677 which, although it allowed ecclesiastical courts to charge people with \\"atheism, blasphemy, heresy, schism, or other damnable doctrine or opinion\\", limited their power to excommunication. Execution of the sentence Woodcut of the burning of Anne Askew, for heresy, at Smithfield in 1546 Public executions were normally attended by large crowds. For the killing in 1546 of Anne Askew, charged with heresy and tortured at the Tower of London, a \\"Substantial Stage\\" was built to seat the various officials who presided over her burning. A witness to proceedings reported that Askew was so badly injured by her torture that she was unable to stand. Instead, \\"the dounge carte was holden up between ij sarjantes, perhaps sitting there in a cheare\\". A report detailing the burning of Prudence Lee in 1652 A pamphlet detailing the burning in April 1652 of Joan Peterson, the so-called Witch of Wapping, also describes the execution of Prudence Lee, found guilty of mariticide. Lee was apparently brought on foot, between two sheriff's officers and dressed in a red waistcoat, to the place of execution in Smithfield. There she confessed to having \\"been a very lewd liver, and much given to cursing and swearing, for which the Lord being offended with her, had suffered her to be brought to that untimely end\\". She admitted to being jealous of and arguing with her husband, and stabbing him with a knife. The executioner put her in a pitch barrel, tied her to the stake, placed the fuel and faggots around her and set them alight. Lee was reported to have \\"desired all that were present to pray for her\\" and, feeling the flames, \\"shrike[d] out terribly some five or six several times.\\" Burning alive for murder was abolished in 1656, although burning for adultery remained. Thereafter, out of mercy, the condemned were often strangled before the flames took hold. Notable exceptions to this practice were the burnings in 1685 and 1726 of Elizabeth Gaunt, found guilty of high treason for her part in the Rye House Plot, and Catherine Hayes, for petty treason. Hayes apparently \\"rent the air with her cries and lamentations\\" when the fire was lit too early, preventing the executioner from strangling her in time. She became the last woman in England to be burned alive. The law also allowed for the hanging of children aged seven years or more. Mary Troke, \\"but sixteen years of age\\", was burned at Winchester in 1738 for poisoning her mistress. An unidentified 14-year-old girl imprisoned at Newgate was more fortunate. Found guilty in 1777 of being an accomplice to treason, for concealing whitewashed farthings on her person (at her master's request), she had been sentenced to burn. She was saved by the intervention of Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath, who happened to be passing. Changing attitudes In 1786, Phoebe Harris and her accomplices were \\"indicted, for that they, on the 11th of February last, one piece of false, feigned, and counterfeit money and coin, to the likeness and similitude of the good, legal, and silver coin of this realm, called a shilling, falsely, deceitfully, feloniously, and traiterously did counterfeit and coin\\". Watched by a reported 20,000 people, she was led to the stake and stood on a stool, where a noose, attached to an iron bolt driven into the top of the stake, was placed around her neck. As prayers were read, the stool was taken away and over the course of several minutes, her feet kicking as her body convulsed, Harris choked to death. About 30 minutes later, faggots were placed around the stake, her body was chained into position, and subsequently burned for over two hours. Executions like this had once passed with little to no comment in the press. Historically, while fewer women than men were subjected to capital punishment, proportionately more were acquitted, found guilty of lesser charges, or pardoned if condemned. In centuries past, these women were judged by publications such as The Newgate Calendar to have succumbed to their own perversions, or to have been led astray. But while 18th and 19th-century women guilty of treasonable crimes were still seen as villains, increasingly, the cause of their descent was ascribed to villainous men. Those people concerned about the brutality inflicted on condemned women were, in Gatrell's opinion, \\"activated by the sense that even at their worst women were creatures to be pitied and protected from themselves, and perhaps revered, like all women from whom men were born.\\" Commenting on Harris's execution, The Daily Universal Register claimed that the act reflected \\"a scandal upon the law\\", \\"a disgrace to the police\\" and \\"was not only inhuman, but shamefully indelicate and shocking\\". The newspaper asked \\"why should the law in this species of offence inflict a severer punishment upon a woman, than upon a man\\"? Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which, if passed, would have abolished the practice. But as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. Though sympathetic to reform of England's Bloody Code, Lord Chief Justice Loughborough saw no need to change the law: \\"Although the punishment, as a spectacle, was rather attended with circumstances of horror, likely to make a more strong impression on the beholders than mere hanging, the effect was much the same, as in fact, no greater degree of personal pain was sustained, the criminal being always strangled before the flames were suffered to approach the body\\". When on 25 June 1788 Margaret Sullivan was hanged and burned for coining, the same newspaper (by then called The Times) wrote: The Gentleman's Magazine addressed the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger: Although in his objections to Wilberforce's 1786 bill Loughborough had noted that these women were dead long before they suffered the flames, many newspapers of the day made no such distinction. The Times incorrectly stated that Sullivan was burned alive, rhetoric which, in Dr Simon Devereaux's opinion, could be \\"rooted in the growing reverence for domesticated womanhood\\" that might have been expected at the time. As many objections may also have been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining, whereas until 1783, when the halting of executions at Tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view, men were simply drawn and hanged. A widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in London (during the 1790s, 393 men versus 47 women), which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the pillory, may also indicate an imposition of commonly-held gender ideals on English penal practices. Abolition Portrait of Sir Benjamin Hammett The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, for coining, received practically no attention from the newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but it may have been enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London. Hammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women. He denounced the punishment as \\"the savage remains of Norman policy\\" which \\"disgraced our statutes\\", as \\"the practice did the common law\\". He also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution. William Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women. Almost 140 years earlier, during the Interregnum, a group of lawyers and laymen known as the Hale Commission (after its chairman Matthew Hale), was tasked by the House of Commons to take \\"into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law\\". Among the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging, but, mainly through the objections of various interested parties, none of the commission's proposals made it into law during the Rump Parliament. Hammett was confident though. He believed that public opinion was on his side and that \\"the House would go with him in the cause of humanity\\". The change in execution venues, from Tyburn to Newgate, also attracted criticism. Following Phoebe Harris's burning in 1786, as well as questioning the inequality of English law The Times complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals: Another factor was the fate of Sophia Girton, found guilty of coining. Hammett's bill was introduced only four days before Girton's fate was to be decided, but a petition for her respite from burning, supported by another sheriff of London (either Thomas Baker or William Newman) and brought to King George III's notice by William Grenville, proved successful. Devereaux suggests that her impending fate lent weight to the eventual outcome of Hammett's bill, which was to abolish the burning of women for treason through the Treason Act 1790. Catherine Murphy, who at her execution in 1789 was \\"drest in a clean striped gown, a white ribbon, and a black ribbon round her cap\\", was the last woman in England to be burned.
