She is a climate advocate for the Union of Concerned Scientists and former deputy director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies. Early life and education Nicole Hernandez Hammer was born to Oscar Hernandez and Maria Eugenia Estrada, in Guatemala of Cuban heritage. Her brother is the actor Oscar Isaac. At the age of four, her family migrated to the US. When Hernandez-Hammer was an infant, her family experienced a substantial earthquake and when she was a teenager, a hurricane hit her home in Miami. She and her family lost everything. She earned an M.S. in biology from Florida Atlantic University, and an MBA from Palm Beach Atlantic University. Research and career =Research= Nicole Hernandez Hammer, 2017 Hammer's research is focused on how climate change is affecting communities of color and low-income communities. Hammer made the connection that Latino populations were the most vulnerable to sea level rise compared to other populations. With this information, she was determined to spread the message through outreach and further research. In 2013, Hammer was a part of the 2013 Climate Assessment of Southeast US to further assess the damage of infrastructure due to sea level rise and has done many interviews and publications on the effects of sea level rise on communities of color. =Public outreach= Hammer is involved in outreach to the general public. She and her work have been discussed in outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, NBC, National Geographic, and NPR. In 2016, Hammer attended the Climate March and spoke to several news networks on how important research funding from the government is for tracking the changes of the earth from climate change. She was also on panel for Amy Poehler's Smart Girls where she talked about the disproportionate impacts of climate change on communities of color. In general, she communicates on how important it is for the government to become involved in combating climate change for future generations. Additionally, Hammer has done outreach in the political sphere as well. She has spoken at the Democratic National Convention in June 2016 on how climate change is an immediate concern for the country through the effects of rising sea levels on vulnerable Latino communities. She communicated direct immediate actions the government can take to relieve the stresses of rising sea levels and pollution on Latino communities. Her public outreach also extends to Latino communities to make climate change information more accessible to those who need it most. While working at Moms Clean Air Force, she worked to develop Spanish outreach materials on climate change so that individuals can arm themselves with information they need to protect themselves. Additionally, while working at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit that informs people about climate change, she led climate change adaptation projects for not only Latino communities but all communities of color. Her goal is to help to inform Latino voters on issues of climate change and empower them to talk to their local officials. =Honors and awards= In 2015, Hammer was invited to the State of the Union Address by First Lady Michelle Obama to spread awareness about climate change and its effects on communities of color.

It was later released on March 12, 2020 for Xbox One. The player controls the titular red creature, Piku, through a colorful world, to put an end to a plot to harvest the entirety of the land's resources. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with its main criticism being the short length of the game. Gameplay Pikuniku is a puzzle and adventure game where the player must control the protagonist, Piku, through levels and solve puzzles to progress. The majority of puzzles involve kicking and pushing objects onto switches to open doors and access rooms, allowing the player to proceed through the level. Piku can also lasso his legs to swing from hooks or curl into a ball and roll, allowing the player to move around faster and reach higher or previously inaccessible areas. Throughout the game, the player will encounter villages, where they can interact with villagers, and spend currency earned in the game's levels on items such as hats. The game also features a local cooperative mode with 9 levels, and the second player controlling Niku, an orange creature similar to Piku. Both of the players must cooperate to negotiate themselves to a boat at the end of the level. Synopsis The game begins with the protagonist, Piku, waking up from his slumber in a cave. After venturing to a nearby village, locals become terrified of Piku. They locked him up in a cage calling to him a 'ghastly beast of legend', settling on imprisoning him until he agrees to fix the town bridge, which he'd accidentally destroyed. After repairing the bridge and being set free from imprisonment, the town enlists him to help deal with the entrepreneurial Mr. Sunshine, a pink creature similar to Piku, who attempts to harvest the entirety of the world's natural resources for his own wealth.  Plot  Mr. Sunshine, a pink creature who owns a company operating flying industrial robots and acts as the game's antagonist, seeks to automate towns over the land by offering a universal basic income to all citizens of the towns who sign his contract ‚Äì allowing him to take their \\"trash\\" (actually primary goods like corn, which the game world inhabitants grow full time) in exchange of what he calls \\"free money\\". After an unnamed village's automation, Piku is awakened by a ghost in a nearby cave. As he comes out, he discovers he's actually been erroneously painted by the village's artist as a dark beast, and he is put in a cage by the frightened inhabitants. However, he is let free after it is discovered that he is virtually harmless. Once Piku has earned the townsfolk's trust, he proceeds to explore the world, soon to be greeted by Mr. Sunshine himself on a flying robot. Along with three other people, he passively participates in a random extraction for a free tour of Mr. Sunshine's workplace. The raffle is won by one of the commoners in the crowd, a boy named Eli, who is taken to visit the magnate's secret volcano base. Piku then travels through a swamp and reaches a forest, where he is tasked with defeating a dancing robot at a club. After witnessing an explosive attack against one of Mr. Sunshine's robots, Piku joins the Resistance, an environmental guerrilla trio of forest villagers based in an abandoned underground metro station who intend to stop Mr. Sunshine's evil doings by destroying his robots with exploding pine cones. Piku and the Resistance march onto a lake separating the forest from the volcano base, but they discover that it has been dried out by Mr. Sunshine. They decide to reach the base by passing through a series of mines located below the surface. A family of black worms welcomes Piku and the Resistance in the abandoned mining site. The mother, a giant worm, recounts how they have been suffering due to the lack of the lake's water, which once spilled from the pipes. Before helping Piku in any way, she asks him to rescue her child Ernie, who has become significantly overweight after drinking radioactive water from a pipe further underground. After finding Ernie and transporting him through the cave, Piku discovers the fate of an unknown civilization, who perished in a Pompeii-like eruption disaster; the creatures' shape resembles Mr. Sunshine's, but it is unknown whether he is a survivor of a natural catastrophe or if he killed his own kind with the volcano. Once Ernie is brought back to his mother, the worms assist him in destroying Mr. Sunshine's last robot in exchange for his support. The final portion of the game takes place inside Mr. Sunshine's underground base, where he is plotting to destroy the surrounding land by covering it with lava in order to establish a new city with perfect inhabitants ‚Äì although such beings are actually genetically degenerate creations with low intelligence, made by splicing the genes of the townsfolk with the forest villagers; a half of a creature of said species met by Piku in the base's laboratory may or may not have once been Eli. After leaving the laboratory, Piku reaches a pit over live magma where Mr. Sunshine tries to have him killed. Piku avoids Mr. Sunshine's robot's lasers until his robotic henchmen piloting it go on a strike after discovering they aren't equally paid. Suddenly, Ernie comes to the rescue by rolling into the pit and letting Piku use his body as a platform to jump out of it. Piku proceeds to chase Mr. Sunshine over the magma, avoiding pop corn launched from the latter's motorboat. Upon arriving at a dead end, Mr. Sunshine decides to press the button which will make the volcano erupt, but the lava is so unexpectedly powerful ‚Äì Mr. Sunshine in fact states that he meant for the lava to cover the land, not erupt like a geyser ‚Äì that they are both ejected into the atmosphere on a platform. As Piku kicks him, Mr. Sunshine is sent into space. A supposedly all-knowing being (actually the ghost from the start of the game, now manifesting itself as a room with eyes) then rescues Piku through a magic hole, informing him of his mission's outcome before sending him safely back to the base. Piku leaves along with the other Resistance members, going back to sleep in his cave off-screen. After the story's events, the player can still explore the slightly altered post-game world to achieve all trophies, completing whatever had been left behind during the main playthrough. Reception Pikuniku received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on the Nintendo Switch and \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on the PC version of the game according to review aggregator Metacritic. =Accolades= The game was nominated for \\"Best International Indie Game\\" at the P√©gases Awards 2020.

George Hodel was a prime suspect in the Black Dahlia murder mystery, giving Fauna's memoir a connection to what is frequently cited as one of the most famous unsolved murders in American history.

Elsewhere in South Australia the Local Board of Main Roads was the precursor to local government, but in the South East it was district drainage boards.\\" The original South-East Drainage District was formed in April 1876. Over the next five years parts were split off to form new drainage districts. The Mayurra Drainage District was established on 27 April 1882 in the vicinity of the Hundred of Mayurra and the township of Millicent, which lies across the hundred northern border in the Hundred of Mount Muirhead. The District Council of Mayurra was established in 1888 by the enactment of the District Councils Act 1887, a statewide legislative push to ensure all settled areas of the state be under local governance. It stated that all existing drainage districts (and the accompanying drainage boards) were to effectively become district councils. In 1903 the council name was changed from Mayurra to Millicent. On 4 June 1914, Millicent annexed the District Council of Mount Muirhead. The enlarged council area was divided into five wards: Central, Mayurra, Mount Muirhead, Nangula, and Rendlesham.

The line was first proposed by the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, and a variety of studies have been conducted into its feasibility and possible routes, but no construction work has been undertaken. Major obstacles to the line's construction include the proposed connection to the existing Dandenong corridor, one of the busiest in Melbourne, and the lack of a protected reservation in which to build the line. As a consequence, various alternative proposals for providing mass public transport to the Rowville area have also been proposed, although none have yet been constructed.  Background  Rowville is a primarily residential suburb of Melbourne approximately from the Central Business District. It forms part of the City of Knox local government area. The main Clayton campus of Monash University is nearby, designated as a major suburban employment cluster in the Melbourne 2030 development plan. Stations on the Lilydale, Glen Waverley and Dandenong lines are within of Rowville and the university, but the area is described by local residents as a \\"black hole\\" for public transport due to a lack of coordinated or high-frequency bus services.  History  The 1969 Transportation Plan recommended three significant extensions to the suburban rail network: a Doncaster railway line; a connection from Frankston to Dandenong and a semi-orbital line from the Dandenong line near Huntingdale to the Belgrave line near Ferntree Gully via the Rowville area. A study conducted by consultants for the government of Premier Jeff Kennett in the late 1990s to examine alternatives to the Scoresby Freeway investigated an extension of the Glen Waverley line to the Rowville area. It estimated the cost at $326 million but found patronage would be too low to justify the outlay.

Cocke was placed into the national spotlight due to his role in the controversy following the 1876 presidential election.  Early life and education  Cocke was born in 1822 in Powhatan County, Virginia. He was a member of the Cocke family, a powerful Virginian political family. Cocke attended the College of William and Mary, graduating in 1843. He was admitted into the Virginia Bar in the same year, and began a private practice in Richmond, Virginia. Cocke married Catherine Parkhill in 1852 and moved to her home in Leon County, Florida.  Political career  In 1852, following the collapse of the national Whig Party due to the disastrous 1852 presidential election, Cocke, like many other Southern Whigs, fled to the Democratic Party. Cocke continued his private practice in Florida until the beginning of the American Civil War, when he accepted a high-profile position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury in Richmond. Due to ailing health, Cocke returned to Florida in 1865, settling in Monticello. While in Monticello, Cocke continued his law practice and started the town's first newspaper. In 1868, Republican Governor Harrison Reed appointed Cocke as a judge to the First Judicial Circuit. He served in this position until January 16, 1873, when newly elected Republican Governor Ossian B. Hart appointed him to be the Florida Attorney General, mostly as a result of Cocke's support of Hart and Republican President Ulysses S. Grant during the 1872 election. Despite his noble character, his aspirations often led to conflict with his Republican counterparts, though he continued to serve under Hart and his Republican successor Governor Marcellus Stearns. = 1876 United States presidential election = Due to Grant choosing not to seek a third term as President, the 1876 presidential election would decide his successor. The Republicans chose Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats chose New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden as their candidates at their respective conventions. Though Tilden clearly beat Hayes in the popular vote, the electoral vote was extremely close. After a first count of votes, Tilden won 184 electoral votes to Hayes' 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved, with a candidate needing 185 in order to win. The remaining four states ‚Äì Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon ‚Äì made up the remaining 20 electoral votes. Due to the impending constitutional crisis, Congress set up the bipartisan Electoral Commission and the three Southern states set up their own returning boards. The Florida board, named the Florida Board of State Canvassers, was set up by Stearns in late 1876. Stearns appointed three members to the board: Republican Secretary of State Samuel Mclin, Republican Comptroller Dr. Clayton A. Cowgill, and Cocke as the sole Democrat. Despite the protest of Cocke, the Republican board members threw out 2,000 votes, and declared Hayes the winner by a margin of 924 votes. More importantly, however, they declared Stearns the winner of the tight gubernatorial election, versus Democratic challenger businessman George Franklin Drew, a Northern Democrat. However, on December 14, 1876, the Florida Supreme Court, though consisting of several Republicans, filed a writ of mandamus with the returning board as a result of the obvious corruption in the counting of votes, particularly in Manatee County, where votes were so fraudulent the proper result could not be determined. It was determined that the writ applied to only McLin and Cowgill, as Cocke used proper discretion and was exceedingly nonpartisan. Initially, McLin and Cowgill intended to violate the court order, believing that the federal Republican courts would save them. In South Carolina, the same situation occurred; however, when the returning board members in South Carolina were arrested, the federal courts did not come to their aid. Though initially McLin and Cowgill were going to obey the court order, Stearns appealed to national Republicans for aid, figuring that a loss for statewide Republicans would reflect on the presidential election. Republican National Committee Chairman Zachariah Chandler of Michigan, Indiana Senator Oliver P. Morton, and Ohio Senator John Sherman decided to intervene on Stearns' behalf. With the backing of the national Republicans, Stearns ordered McLin, Cowgill, and Cocke to disobey the court orders at all costs. Eventually the Republicans and Democrats came to a compromise, with Drew being declared winner of the gubernatorial election and Hayes declared the recipient of Florida's 4 electoral votes, despite Cocke's protests against the latter. This smaller compromise, along with the compromises for the other three states, form the Compromise of 1877, which resulted in Hayes receiving the remaining 20 electoral votes, thereby winning the presidency, in exchange for the end of Reconstruction. Due to Cocke's support for him and Tilden while on the returning board, Drew appointed Cocke to the Seventh Judicial Circuit in 1877, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1885.  Death and burial  Cocke died at his home in Sanford, Florida on October 17, 1887. He is buried in Sanford's Lakeview Cemetery.

The hospital was two primary locations in Yonkers, which is the result of its merger with Yonkers General Hospital in 2001.  History  St. John's Invalid Home was founded in 1869 by a group of women from St. John's Episcopal Church in Yonkers to tend to the poor of their parish. As the first hospital in Westchester County, it was incorporated as a non-profit institution in the early 1870s. First located at Warburton and Ashburton Avenues, the hospital moved to Woodworth Avenue and Locust Street in 1870, before relocating again to buildings on Ashburton Avenue donated by William and Eva Cochran in 1894. That year, the Cochran School of Nursing was established at the hospital as the first nursing school in Westchester County and one of the first in the United States. The school is affiliated with Mercy College and SUNY Delhi. The hospital constructed its current Andrus Pavilion on North Broadway in 1959, which rises 14 stories and accommodates 273 beds. In 1999, the hospital constructed a nursing home. It acquired a second location, the ParkCare Pavilion, after merging with Yonkers General Hospital in 2001, which today is an outpatient center. The additional Michael N. Malotz Skilled Nursing Pavilion was opened that year, which houses 120 beds. Today, the hospital contains a total of 407 beds, maintains a staff of 300 physicians, and is accredited by the New York State Department of Health and the Joint Commission.

She is particularly noted for her imagery and scholarship on queer desire and politics, as well as on the ideologies of American landscape photography. Her work is in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Fogg Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Bright's photographic projects have been exhibited internationally.  Life and career  Bright grew up in Washington, D.C. She received her M.F.A. from the University of Chicago in 1975. Bright joined the faculty at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1989 with a joint appointment in History of Art and Visual Culture (HAVC) and Photography. She also served RISD in many other capacities, from department head to stepping in as Acting Dean of Fine Arts, until 2012 when Bright left RISD to become chair of Fine Arts at the Pratt Institute. Since her retirement from Pratt, Bright lives in Brooklyn, NY and has resumed painting queer abstractions.  Artistic Works  Deborah Bright is notable for her writing and photographic bodies of work on LGBT, queer, and women's right subject matter, as well as for her writing about and work of landscape photography. = Gender and Sexuality =  Dream Girls (1989-90)  Bright first gained renown for her series called Dream Girls (1989‚Äì90), which challenged mainstream, heteronormative gender-sex identities propagated in Hollywood movies.1996, Marsha Meskimmon, \\"The Art of Reflection: Women's Artists' Self-portraiture in the Twentieth Century, \\"Columbia University Press.\\" Inspired by her adolescent fantasies, Bright recreated iconic Hollywood movie scenes of the 20th century, inserting herself into film stills from the 1940s and 50s. She appears in place of such iconic romantic male leads as Spencer Tracy and Rock Hudson opposite their female counterparts, including Katherine Hepburn, in a fulfillment of lesbian desire that thematizes gender and LGBTQ+ subject matter.  Being and Riding (1996-99)  While working on Dream Girls, Bright also worked on a similarly themed photographic series called Being and Riding (1996‚Äì1999), which focuses on a common female childhood obsession with horses. The series featured provocatively framed plastic toy horses and female figures. In 2008, Deborah Bright collaborated with other artists in an exhibition called Pink and Bent: Art of Queer Women. The exhibition took place at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art on May 21-June 28, 2008 and was curated by Pilar Gallego and Cora Lambert. In the wake of the 2016 Presidential election of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, Bright participated in the Nasty Women project (2017) along with other female artists. The exhibition took place at the Knockdown Center in Maspeth, Queens, New York  Non-photographic works  Between 2015‚Äì2017 after her retirement from Pratt, Bright began creating a series of works using colored pencil and graphite on Bristol board. The five works, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, Bad Moon Rising, My Egypt, Funkflash, and Night Radio, all work together to defy traditional gender norms. = Landscape Photography =  Battlefield Panoramas (1981-84)  Deborah Bright's 1983 work, Bloody Lane, The Battle of Antietam, was displayed at the Smithsonian in 1992. Bloody Lane consists of six 13x19 inch selenium toned silver prints, which are part of her Battlefield Panoramas series. The work was also displayed at the Siskind Center from September 10, 1993 ‚Äì January 9, 1994. Crow Agency: Battle of the Little Big Horn is part of her Battlefield Panoramas series (1981‚Äì84), which references the nineteenth-century panorama photography tradition of Edweard Muybridge and William Henry Jackson. This color photography series represents a bodily immersion view of the battlefield from the perspective of those on the ground fighting rather than from the traditional landscape perspective from on high. The views are dominated by the tall grasses and draws of the Montana landscape. All That Is Solid Her installation piece All that is Solid was displayed from 1992‚Äì2001 in five cities throughout the United States. She installed each piece based on their location; Bright wanted the work to reflect the area's de-industrialization in addition to former industrial areas through the local details. Manifest Series In Bright‚Äôs Manifest series the artist explores agricultural enclosures and family heritage in New England symbolized by the omnipresent stone walls, and focuses on self definition and political enfranchisement centered on individual male property ownership. Her work was made around the same time as her All that is Solid piece in 2000-01. Glacial Erratic (2000-03)  From 2000-03, Bright created Glacial Erratic, which consists of nine photographs of Plymouth Rock at different tides and times of day, akin to Claude Monet's series of Cathedral and Haystacks 19th-century Impressionist paintings. For this body of work, Bright photographed the rock in tight framing that reveals the iconic rock's containment within a metal fence and secured as a tourist site.

If the floor plan is a logarithmic spiral, it is called conchospiral (from conch). Conchospirals are used in biology for modelling snail shells, and flight paths of insects New ScientistConchospirals in the Flight of Insects and in electrical engineering for the construction of antennas.John D.

Mat. Mekh. Inform., 11:2 (2011), pp. 65‚Äì76.  Parametric representation  In the x-y- plane a spiral with parametric representation : x=r(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\ ,\\\\qquad y=r(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi a third coordinate z(\\\\varphi) can be added such that the space curve lies on the cone with equation \\\\;m^2(x^2+y^2)=(z-z_0)^2\\\\ ,\\\\ m>0\\\\; : * x=r(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\ ,\\\\qquad y=r(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\ , \\\\qquad \\\\color{red}{z=z_0 + mr(\\\\varphi)} \\\\ . Such curves are called conical spirals.Siegmund G√ºnther, Anton Edler von Braunm√ºhl, Heinrich Wieleitner: Geschichte der mathematik. G. J. G√∂schen, 1921, p. 92. They were known to Pappos. Parameter m is the slope of the cone's lines with respect to the x-y-plane. A conical spiral can instead be seen as the orthogonal projection of the floor plan spiral onto the cone. =Examples= : 1) Starting with an archimedean spiral \\\\;r(\\\\varphi)=a\\\\varphi\\\\; gives the conical spiral (see diagram) : x=a\\\\varphi\\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\ ,\\\\qquad y=a\\\\varphi\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\ , \\\\qquad z=z_0 + ma\\\\varphi \\\\ ,\\\\quad \\\\varphi \\\\ge 0 \\\\ . : In this case the conical spiral can be seen as the intersection curve of the cone with a helicoid. : 2) The second diagram shows a conical spiral with a Fermat's spiral \\\\;r(\\\\varphi)=\\\\pm a\\\\sqrt{\\\\varphi}\\\\; as floor plan. : 3) The third example has a logarithmic spiral \\\\; r(\\\\varphi)=a e^{k\\\\varphi} \\\\; as floor plan. Its special feature is its constant slope (see below). : Introducing the abbreviation K=e^kgives the description: r(\\\\varphi)=aK^\\\\varphi. : 4) Example 4 is based on a hyperbolic spiral \\\\; r(\\\\varphi)=a/\\\\varphi\\\\; . Such a spiral has an asymptote (black line), which is the floor plan of a hyperbola (purple). The conical spiral approaches the hyperbola for \\\\varphi \\\\to 0.  Properties  The following investigation deals with conical spirals of the form r=a\\\\varphi^n and r=ae^{k\\\\varphi}, respectively. = Slope = Slope angle at a point of a conical spiral The slope at a point of a conical spiral is the slope of this point's tangent with respect to the x-y-plane. The corresponding angle is its slope angle (see diagram): : \\\\tan \\\\beta = \\\\frac{z'}{\\\\sqrt{(x')^2+(y')^2}}=\\\\frac{mr'}{\\\\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}\\\\ . A spiral with r=a\\\\varphi^n gives: * \\\\tan\\\\beta=\\\\frac{mn}{\\\\sqrt{n^2+\\\\varphi^2}}\\\\ . For an archimedean spiral is n=1 and hence its slope is\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\beta=\\\\tfrac{m}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\varphi^2}}\\\\ . * For a logarithmic spiral with r=ae^{k\\\\varphi} the slope is \\\\ \\\\tan\\\\beta= \\\\tfrac{mk}{\\\\sqrt{1+k^2}}\\\\ (\\\\color{red}{\\\\text{ constant!}} ). Because of this property a conchospiral is called an equiangular conical spiral. = Arclength = The length of an arc of a conical spiral can be determined by : L=\\\\int_{\\\\varphi_1}^{\\\\varphi_2}\\\\sqrt{(x')^2+(y')^2+(z')^2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\varphi = \\\\int_{\\\\varphi_1}^{\\\\varphi_2}\\\\sqrt{(1+m^2)(r')^2+r^2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\varphi \\\\ . For an archimedean spiral the integral can be solved with help of a table of integrals, analogously to the planar case: : L= \\\\frac{a}{2}\\\\big [\\\\varphi\\\\sqrt{(1+m^2)+\\\\varphi^2}+(1+m^2)\\\\ln \\\\big (\\\\varphi+\\\\sqrt{(1+m^2)+\\\\varphi^2}\\\\big )\\\\big ]_{\\\\varphi_1}^{\\\\varphi_2}\\\\ . For a logarithmic spiral the integral can be solved easily: : L=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{(1+m^2)k^2+1}}{k}(r\\\\big(\\\\varphi_2)-r(\\\\varphi_1)\\\\big)\\\\ . In other cases elliptical integrals occur. = Development = Development(green) of a conical spiral (red), right: a side view. The plane containing the development is designed by \\\\pi. Initially the cone and the plane touch at the purple line. For the development of a conical spiralTheodor Schmid: Darstellende Geometrie. Band 2, Vereinigung wissenschaftlichen Verleger, 1921, p. 229. the distance \\\\rho(\\\\varphi) of a curve point (x,y,z) to the cone's apex (0,0,z_0)and the relation between the angle \\\\varphi and the corresponding angle \\\\psi of the development have to be determined: : \\\\rho=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-z_0)^2}=\\\\sqrt{1+m^2}\\\\;r \\\\ , : \\\\varphi= \\\\sqrt{1+m^2}\\\\psi \\\\ . Hence the polar representation of the developed conical spiral is: * \\\\rho(\\\\psi)=\\\\sqrt{1+m^2}\\\\; r(\\\\sqrt{1+m^2}\\\\psi) In case of r=a\\\\varphi^n the polar representation of the developed curve is : \\\\rho=a\\\\sqrt{1+m^2}^{\\\\,n+1}\\\\psi^n, which describes a spiral of the same type. * If the floor plan of a conical spiral is an archimedean spiral than its development is an archimedean spiral. : In case of a hyperbolic spiral (n=-1) the development is congruent to the floor plan spiral. In case of a logarithmic spiral r=ae^{k\\\\varphi} the development is a logarithmic spiral: : \\\\rho=a\\\\sqrt{1+m^2}\\\\;e^{k\\\\sqrt{1+m^2}\\\\psi}\\\\ . = Tangent trace = The trace (purple) of the tangents of a conical spiral with a hyperbolic spiral as floor plan. The black line is the asymptote of the hyperbolic spiral. The collection of intersection points of the tangents of a conical spiral with the x-y-plane (plane through the cone's apex) is called its tangent trace. For the conical spiral : (r\\\\cos\\\\varphi, r\\\\sin\\\\varphi,mr) the tangent vector is : (r'\\\\cos\\\\varphi-r\\\\sin\\\\varphi,r'\\\\sin\\\\varphi+r\\\\cos\\\\varphi,mr')^T and the tangent: : x(t)=r\\\\cos\\\\varphi+t(r'\\\\cos\\\\varphi-r\\\\sin\\\\varphi)\\\\ , : y(t)=r\\\\sin\\\\varphi +t(r'\\\\sin\\\\varphi+r\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\ , : z(t)=mr+tmr'\\\\ . The intersection point with the x-y-plane has parameter t=-r/r' and the intersection point is * \\\\left( \\\\frac{r^2}{r'}\\\\sin\\\\varphi, -\\\\frac{r^2}{r'}\\\\cos\\\\varphi,0 \\\\right)\\\\ . r=a\\\\varphi^n gives \\\\ \\\\tfrac{r^2}{r'}=\\\\tfrac{a}{n}\\\\varphi^{n+1}\\\\ and the tangent trace is a spiral. In the case n=-1 (hyperbolic spiral) the tangent trace degenerates to a circle with radius a (see diagram). For r=a e^{k\\\\varphi} one has \\\\ \\\\tfrac{r^2}{r'}=\\\\tfrac{r}{k}\\\\ and the tangent trace is a logarithmic spiral, which is congruent to the floor plan, because of the self-similarity of a logarithmic spiral.

Self- described as \\"Psychedelic Reggae Ska Doom Metal Punk Rock From Hell,\\" the band are known for their high-energy live shows and their mix of genres including dub, punk rock and heavy metal. To date, the band have released four studio albums and two EPs. History The band originally formed in 2009 under the name Madonna. Under this name, the band released a self-titled collection of demo recordings on CD in 2010 before changing their name to The Bennies the following year due to legal issues concerning the use of the name. Under their new name, The Bennies would release their debut album Party Party Party! on 3 September 2011 via Jackknife Music. In 2012, the band underwent their first line-up change after guitarist Steve Lavery departed from the band and was replaced by Christos \\"Souv\\" Salaoras. Following a tour of Japan later that year, Salaoras also left The Bennies. His replacement was Jules Rozenbergs, who had previously played in Melbourne punk bands Kimbo and The Gun Runners. This line-up would remain intact for the next six years, with their first release being 2013's Better Off Dread EP on April 20, 2013. This was followed by Rainbows in Space, the band's second studio album, which was released in November. It marked the band's first release with Poison City Records, who would put out every Bennies release until 2017. In 2014, the band released their second EP, Heavy Disco. To promote the release, the band appeared on triple j's Like a Version segment in February 2015. The band performed a stripped-back version of \\"Heavy Disco\\", as well as a cover of TISM's \\"(He'll Never Be An) Ol' Man River.\\" Damian Cowell, who was a member of TISM, gave his approval of the cover to the band and performed the song with them live in 2016. The Bennies themselves would later contribute to Cowell's second studio album as Damian Cowell's Disco Machine, 2017's Get Yer Dag On!, featuring on the song \\"365 Lemmys.\\" In 2015, a new single titled \\"Party Machine\\" was released. The song ended up being their most successful single to date, and was voted into the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2015 at number 88. The song was the lead single from their third studio album, Wisdom Machine, which was released on 25 March 2016. The album spawned a further three singles ‚Äì \\"Legalise (But Don't Tax),\\" \\"Detroit Rock Ciggies\\" and \\"Corruption\\" ‚Äì with music videos being made for the latter two. The band released a single, \\"Get High Like an Angel\\", in late 2017, and toured Australia in support of it. It would serve as the opening track on The Bennies' fourth studio album, Natural Born Chillers. The album was released on 2 February 2018 and was the band's first release through Pool House Records. In March 2018, it was announced that bassist, vocalist and founding member Craig Selak would be departing from the band following two remaining festival shows. His replacement was Nick Williams, who the band had met years prior from touring with Williams' band Foxtrot. Selak would go on to form LOSER, alongside former Apart From This frontman Tim Maxwell and former Smith Street Band drummer Chris Cowburn. The band continued to tour in support of Natural Born Chillers throughout 2018, releasing music videos for \\"Dreamkillers\\" and \\"Trip Report.\\" In January 2019, the band announced that longtime friend Graham Leach ‚Äì AKA DJ Snes Mega ‚Äì would be joining the band on a permanent basis.

Early life and education  Swearingen was born on February 2, 1873 in Nassau County, Florida. After being educated in local schools, Swearingen attended Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, graduating with his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1899. After graduating, he moved to Jacksonville, Florida and began a private practice.  Political career  = Mayor of Jacksonville = In 1911, Governor Albert W. Gilchrist appointed Swearingen, a Democrat, to Jacksonville's municipal court. He served on the court until 1913, when he successfully ran for mayor of Jacksonville, defeating Socialist Thomas W. Cox with over 92% of the vote. As mayor, Swearingen began cracking down on vice, closing the bordellos and keeping minors out of pool halls. This struck a nerve with many in Jacksonville who saw value in the city's red light district. Swearingen even used spies in the form of undercover police officers to help find hidden bordellos. Swearingen sought reelection in 1915, though he faced three challengers in the Democratic primary: businessman Rudolph Grunthal, physician Charles Johnson, and former mayor J. E. T. Bowden. Though Swearingen came in first during the first round of the primary, he was defeated in the runoff by Bowden, receiving just 41.5% of the vote. Bowden would go on to win in the general election, defeating Socialist I. C. Baldwin. = Florida Attorney General = In 1917, newly elected Governor Sidney Johnston Catts, a member of the Prohibition Party, appointed the incumbent Florida Attorney General, Thomas F. West, to the Florida Supreme Court. Seeing Swearingen's efforts in cracking down on Jacksonville's red light district, Catts appointed him to finish the remaining 3 years of West's term. Swearingen's tenure as Florida Attorney General remains controversial, Swearingen oversaw the implementation of prohibition in Florida. Despite making use of his spy network from Jacksonville, Swearingen was unable to combat rum runners coming from Cuba and the Bahamas. Additionally, the Ocoee massacre occurred near the end of Swearingen's tenure. In response to African-Americans attempting to vote in November of 1920 in the town of Ocoee, Florida, the entire black community of North Ocoee was razed to the ground, with as many as 56 blacks lynched or burned in their own homes. Swearingen, a noted racist, did nothing in the aftermath of the massacre to bring the perpetrators to justice. In 1920, Swearingen did not run for reelection, instead deciding to run for Florida governor. Swearingen faced the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Cary A. Hardee and State Senator Lincoln Hulley in the Democratic primary. Swearingen was defeated by Hardee by over 22,000 votes. Hardee would go on to win in the general election. After this loss, Swearingen retired, moving to Miami, Florida in 1925.  Personal life and death  Swearingen married Alice Padgett on January 1, 1899. They had 6 children together. Additionally, Swearingen was a member of multiple fraternal orders, including the Freemasons, the Shriners from Jacksonville's Morocco Temple, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Knights of Pythias. Swearingen died at his home in Miami on March 3, 1943.

It is based on the disputed memoir Unplanned by Abby Johnson. The film stars Ashley Bratcher, Brooks Ryan and Robia Scott, following Johnson's life as a clinic director for Planned Parenthood and her subsequent transition to anti-abortion activism. The film was theatrically released in the United States by evangelical Christian production and distribution house Pure Flix on March 29, 2019. The working title was Redeemed, and details of its subject were kept from the public in order to minimize protests by abortion rights advocates. Some TV channels refused to air ads for the film due to its subject matter. The film grossed $21 million worldwide on a $6 million budget. The accuracy of the film's portrayal of abortion and of Planned Parenthood have been severely criticized by doctors and advocates for Planned Parenthood, with several commentators describing it as political propaganda. Plot The plot closely follows the account found in Abby Johnson's memoir, Unplanned.Lauren Cavalea and Chris Francescani, 'Unplanned' tells the story of the one of the youngest Planned Parenthood employees to become a clinic director ... and the event that she says changed everything, abcnews.go.com, USA, March 28, 2019 The film opens with a depiction of Johnson's home life with her husband, Doug, and daughter, Grace. In voice-over, Abby Johnson says she was tricked into participating with Planned Parenthood and the scene shifts to a time in 2009 when she claims she was asked to assist in an ultrasound-guided suction aspiration abortion at thirteen weeks gestation. The scene ends with Abby leaving in tears. Johnson then describes, in voice over, that her story started her junior year at Texas A&M.; The scene is depicted in flashback of a Planned Parenthood booth at a career fair. Johnson agrees to volunteer after the representative in the booth says to her that their ultimate goal was to reduce the number of abortions. As a clinic escort, she meets director Cheryl and witnesses anti-abortion protesters being verbally confrontational towards the women going in. One protester, Marilisa, is depicted as being kinder to women than the other protestors and says that those from her organization, \\"Coalition for Life\\", are \\"not here to hurt them or condemn them\\". A flashback within a flashback then happens to when Abby had her two abortions, the first as a college student and the second after she marries then divorces. During the second abortion, she is given mifepristone at the clinic and is told there will be \\"a little bleeding\\", but the experience is depicted as being excruciatingly painful, over twelve hours and then followed up with \\"eight weeks of blood clots and excruciating cramps\\" causing her to fear for her life. The film then cuts back to Abby's continuing work at the clinic, and she recounts in voice- over that it became \\"my career, despite the disapproval of virtually everyone in my life\\". The film flashes forward to her second marriage to Doug, a man who proclaims love while, like her parents, disapproving of her career on religious and moral grounds. Abby describes starting her life with Doug and attending a church with him that is decidedly opposed to abortion even while she continues to work at Planned Parenthood. Abby becomes pregnant by Doug and decides to keep it. In the meantime, a scene is depicted of a botched abortion taking place at the clinic where Abby is told not to call an ambulance because of the way it would \\"look\\". Abby gives birth to Grace and is promoted to director when Cheryl is transferred to Houston. Before Hurricane Ike strikes, Abby coordinates all of the abortions to happen beforehand, anticipating that it won't be possible to perform the procedures for a while after the hurricane. Abby wins Employee of the Year while also being told by Cheryl that she should double the number of abortions. Cheryl explains that \\"Non-profit is a tax status, not a business model!\\", and says the organization makes its money off of abortions the way that fast food restaurants make money off fries and soda. Abby is scolded for objecting to this, and then eventually reprimanded by Cheryl for insubordination after which the first few moments of the film are repeated just prior to Abby's participation in the procedure. Abby is then depicted going to the office of 40 Days for Life, run by Marilisa and her husband, Shawn, and tearfully telling them that she cannot stay in her job after what she has seen. They offer to help her find employment. Abby formally resigns from Planned Parenthood and begins to help with the 40 Days for Life campaign, to the point of being on the other side of the clinic fence encouraging women not to go through with their abortions. Planned Parenthood sues Abby for leaking confidential information about their operations, and Shawn convinces his laid-back lawyer friend Jeff to defend her. In 2013, when the clinic Abby worked at has closed, she organizes a celebration at the abandoned building in which she expresses regret for performing abortions as well as having two. The closing captions say that Abby continues to work with the ministry \\"And Then There Were None\\", helping other abortion clinic workers leave and find employment elsewhere. = Accuracy of portrayal = Several outlets‚Äîincluding Variety, The Globe and Mail, The Guardian, and the Toronto Sun‚Äîdescribed the film as \\"propaganda.\\" The New York Times reported on an evaluation of the film's first scene: > In that first scene, teased in the trailer and on posters as \\"the moment > that changed everything\\", Abby, played by Bratcher, witnesses an ultrasound- > guided termination of a pregnancy at 13 weeks. The ultrasound, as depicted > onscreen, shows a fetus with a discernible head, torso and limbs frantically > squirming away from a doctor's probe ‚Äî an action that Abby later describes > as \\"twisting and fighting for its life\\" ‚Äî before being liquefied by suction. > Given a description of this scene, Jennifer Villavicencio, a fellow with the > nonpartisan American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who performs > ultrasound-guided abortions but has not seen the film, said that while an > ultrasound of a 13-week-old fetus may show a visible head and body, the > notion that it would be \\"fighting for its life\\" is misleading. \\"If you watch > an ultrasound, certainly there is movement, but it's not kicking its legs or > recoiling\\", said Villavicencio. She noted broad scientific consensus that > fetuses cannot experience pain, and therefore would not recoil from it, > until well after 13 weeks. \\"There is no neurological capability for > awareness of danger ‚Äî that part of the brain is simply not there yet\\", she > said. Villavicencio explained to the HuffPost that most abortions last three to ten minutes and are \\"well tolerated\\". The film has been criticized for uncritically portraying events as Johnson claims they occurred in spite of a variety of journalists casting doubt on the veracity of her account. Sorting Fact From Fiction in the Story of Pro-life Celebrity Abby Johnson. Texas Monthly, April 16, 2019 Johnson stated that the patient whose abortion led to her decision to leave Planned Parenthood was a black woman. However, based on reporting by Texas Monthly (which relied on Planned Parenthood clinic records), only one patient served by Johnson's then-employer on September 26, 2009 was black, and she was in the sixth week‚Äînot the 13th week‚Äîof her pregnancy. The film purports to depict Planned Parenthood as promoting abortion for the sake of profit. A character, Cheryl (Robia Scott), claims that Planned Parenthood makes its money off of abortions the way that fast food restaurants make money by selling French fries and soda. Anna North of Vox criticized the film for depicting abortion as very dangerous, noting that it's significantly safer than childbirth. Cast Production In September 2018, it was announced that principal photography on a new Pure Flix film with a working title of Redeemed had been completed. Out of fear for potential protests due to the subject matter, everyone involved with the project signed a confidentiality agreement, whereby they agreed not to engage in social media posts about the film nor any press interaction. Additionally, the film was secretly shot in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Based on Johnson's memoir of the same name, Unplanned was produced on a $6 million budget. Mike Lindell, founder and owner of My Pillow, was a major backer of the film, contributing $1 million to production and having a cameo. Directors Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon sent a draft of their script to Johnson for review. Upon reading, Johnson reacted, \\"I read the script. And in the first 15 pages, I hated me. Then I got to the end of the script, and I loved it. It was me!\\" During casting, producers warned potential cast members that their participation in the film might result in their not getting future roles in the film industry due to the film's subject matter. Unlike the upcoming Roe v. Wade ‚Äì which had some crew who quit once they learned of the film's subject matter ‚Äì Unplanned did not suffer from the same fate since those involved knew about the film's focus when hired. Bratcher has related that following her acceptance of the role ‚Äì and just prior to commencement of filming ‚Äì she found out that her mother had had an abortion during her teens and almost had an abortion while she was pregnant with her. Bratcher's mother has a role as an extra. Music labels denied the rights to use such songs as The Fray's \\"How to Save a Life\\", \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" by Cyndi Lauper, One Direction's \\"Story of My Life\\", Oingo Boingo's \\"Dead Man's Party\\" and \\"The Guardian Suite\\" by Trevor Rabin. Christian singer Matthew West wrote a song for the film called \\"Unplanned\\", posting its music video a week before the film's release. MPAA rating Unplanned was given an R rating (the first for any Pure Flix film) by the MPAA, who cited the graphic abortion-related scenes as the reason for the rating and notified the producers of the film that the film would remain R-rated unless those scenes were removed, denying that it had assigned the rating due to political bias. Pure Flix, which had been expecting a PG-13 rating, decided not to contest the MPAA's action due to concerns that such conflict may delay the film's release. In response to the film's rating, the MPAA was sent a complaint signed by twenty-nine people uninvolved in the production of the film. The signers include former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, political commentator Glenn Beck, actor Kevin Sorbo, and Academy Award-winning film producers Gerald R. Molen and Gray Frederickson. Despite this, the MPAA did not revoke the rating, saying that \\"[t]he filmmakers did not make use of the rating appeal process.\\" Johnson subsequently wrote an open letter addressed to parents, stating that the film contained no nudity, sex or profanity. A second open letter, signed by the same twenty-nine people from the MPAA complaint, encouraged faith communities to ignore the R rating and turn out for the film as they did for The Passion of the Christ. Release =United States= Unplanned was released in the United States on March 29, 2019. The film received a pre-screening on February 21, 2019, in lower Manhattan, and again on March 28, 2019, in Indiana, one day before its release date. Many media outlets declined to air advertising for the film on account of the controversial subject matter and/or the film's R rating, including Google, A&E; Networks, Discovery, Inc., Hallmark Channel, NBCUniversal, and Christian radio network K-Love. Google also listed the film as \\"drama/propaganda\\" in search results for a period of time. Only Fox News, who also did editorial coverage of the production, and the Christian Broadcasting Network agreed to air ads. During the opening weekend, its official Twitter account was suspended (reportedly because it was linked to another account that violated Twitter's code of conduct). It was soon reinstated, gaining thousands of additional followers within several hours, with the follower count briefly appearing to shoot up as high as 200,000. Twitter was then accused of dropping followers of the film's account from over 200,000 to approximately 16,000. Senator Josh Hawley accused Twitter of censoring conservative views, and in a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, requested that an outside independent audit be made into Twitter's speech policies. Twitter responded and \\"said follower counts can often take up to 24 hours to stabilize following a suspension and that any issues with page follows should also be resolved shortly\\"; the next day, according to Newsweek, \\"the official account for the film appeared to confirm Twitter's statement\\" in a tweet. Mark Cavaliere, an executive director of a local Coalition for Life, dressed in a 40 Days for Life shirt like those seen in the film and recruited volunteers at some showings. =Canada= No distributors in Canada were initially interested in the film, which prevented movie theaters from picking it up. In June 2019, the small distribution company Cinedicom agreed to make it available to the Canadian market, its president stating the decision to distribute the film was based on divine inspiration. The producers accused Canada's dominant movie theater chain Cineplex Entertainment of effectively banning the film in the country by not showing it in its theaters. However, the company's usual practice is to only consider filmsif their distributor presents a marketing plan and obtains a rating from a provincial ratings board. Cineplex later reversed its decision, opting to screen the film in 14 locations. The competing chain Landmark Cinemas also screened the film at 10 locations.Cineplex defends decision to show anti-abortion film Unplanned (CBC, July 8, 2019) On July 12, 2019, the film took in $352,000 on its opening weekend on 56 screens across Canada for a per-screen average of around $7,100. Unplanned made $643,000 CAD at the Canadian box office. =Philippines= Unplanned premiered exclusively in SM Supermalls cinemas in the Philippines on August 21, 2019. Felcidad Tan-Sy, the widow of SM founder Henry Sy, cried during its local premiere and stated that \\"Every Filipino, every person needs to see this movie.\\" Reception =Box office= In the United States, Unplanned was released alongside The Beach Bum and Dumbo, and based upon tracking was projected to gross $3‚Äì5 million from 1,060 theaters its opening weekend. The film made $3 million on its first day, including $700,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $6.4 million, exceeding box office projections and finishing 4th at the box office, marking the second- best opening for a Pure Flix film behind God's Not Dead 2 ($7.6 million in 2016); the film played best in conservative-leaning states in the Midwest and South. Deadline Hollywood said the opening was \\"remarkable considering that the film was rated R [and was] boxed out from running TV spots on most major cable networks and Christian radio.\\" It was reported that churches across the country had bought out entire screenings for the picture. In its second weekend the film was added to 456 additional theaters (for a total of 1,516) and made $3.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed $21 million. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 4.79/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"A dramatic approach to a hot-button topic whose agenda is immediately clear, Unplanned will only reinforce the feelings of viewers on either side of the issue.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 10 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore after seeing the film gave it a rare \\"A+\\" grade, and those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 80% and a 65% \\"definite recommend\\". Writing for the National Catholic Reporter, Rose Pacatte said that \\"Unplanned is an important film, a designation that directors hate to hear. It is not entertaining (until the cheesy lawyer shows up) but tells an emotional story with wide-ranging implications.\\" The Deseret News's Josh Terry wrote that the film \\"...may not bridge the divide between the different sides of the abortion issue, but it will provide some food for thought for the undecideds\\", ultimately concluding that \\"Unplanned has room for praise and criticism.\\" In contrast, The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck criticized Unplanned as \\"proselytizing agitprop\\" comparable to a \\"basic cable television movie in its mediocre production values and subpar performances\\". Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of Variety said the film \\"isn't good drama but it's effective propaganda\\" and The A.V. Club's Vadim Rizov stated that \\"[while Unplanned] has greater technical finesse than its foundational forebears...[,] there's not a single scene that speaks to characters with lives outside their streamlined narrative function; they're performers in a parable traced over a Chick tract, filmed with a bland competence at odds with the true perversity of the material\\". The Canadian news industry was generally critical of Unplanned. The Globe and Mail, the Ottawa Citizen and the Toronto Sun all described the film as dishonest religious, social, and political propaganda. However, Christian news programs such as 100 Huntley Street, The Faytene Show and Salt + Light Hour were supportive of it. Luke Thompson, in Forbes, notes the heavily political nature of the film, which \\"naturally, drops the name of George Soros and claims the nonprofit is one of the most powerful organizations on the planet...as opposed to, say, a political punching bag constantly in danger of being defunded\\". =Planned Parenthood reaction= Shortly before release, the American division of Planned Parenthood stated that the arguments in it were false. Additionally, the Ottawa chapter opposed the film's first Canadian screening, held at Parliament Hill on April 11, 2019, with four Conservative Party members of Parliament. Soundtrack A soundtrack album was released on March 22, 2019 with the title track being performed by Matthew West. Blake Kanicka, the music supervisor for Unplanned, failed in attempts to license songs from more established mainstream artists and from a half dozen of the largest music companies. ; Tracklist # \\"Masterpiece\\" by Danny Gokey # \\"Unplanned\\" by Matthew West (Written by Matthew West & AJ Pruis) # \\"This Could Change Everything\\" by Francesca Battistelli (Written by Francesca Battistelli, Jason Walker, Tommee Profitt) # \\"Weddingmarch\\" by London Festival Orchestra (Written by Mendelssohn) # \\"Mercy and Majesty\\" by Brian Johnson and Jenn Johnson (Written by Brian Johnson, Jeremy Riddle, Matt Redman, Jason Ingram, Jonas Myrin, Benjamin Glover) (Instrumental) # \\"Merrydeath\\" by Neon Ridge (Written by Mikael Kallin) # \\"Cecie's Lullaby\\" by Steffany Gretzinger (Written by Steffany Gretzinger) # \\"To Our God\\" by Brian Johnson (Written by Brian Johnson, Jeremy Riddle, Joel Taylor) (Without words) # \\"We Dance\\" by Steffany Gretzinger (Written by Steffany Gretzinger & Amanda Cook) # \\"Exigency\\" by Charlie Ryan (Written by Charlie Ryan) # \\"Overcomer\\" by Mandisa (Written by Ben Glover, Christopher Stevens, David Garcia) # \\"Como Un Flor\\" by MML (Written by Antonio Garcia Isaac) # \\"It Is Well (Live) by Kristene DiMarco (Written by Kristene DiMarco) (Without words) # \\"Foreboding\\" by Kyle Preston (Written by Kyle Preston) # \\"You're Gonna Be OK\\" by Jenn Johnson (Written by Jenn Johnson, Seth Mosley, Jeremy Riddle) # \\"Cleanse\\" by Be Still the Earth (Written by Marshall Usinger) # \\"Monster On My Mind\\" by David Stebels and Brent Keast (Written by David Siebels & Brent Keast) # \\"And So They Watched as the Years Passed Us By\\" by This Patch of Sky (Written by Kit Day, Joshua Carlton, Alex Abrams, Joel Erickson) See also *Abortion in the United States *Gosnell: The Trial of America's Biggest Serial Killer, a 2018 film about abortion provider Kermit Gosnell *180, a 2011 anti-abortion documentary *The Silent Scream, a 1984 anti-abortion documentary by Bernard Nathanson describing the abortion process via ultrasound *Roe v.

Development and design In 1933 the Ministry of Aeronautics issued a specification for the supply of a new reconnaissance and bombing seaplane to be allocated to the Departments of the Regia Aeronautica with the intent of replacing the Savoia- Marchetti S.78 in service since 1932. The CRDA CANT, aeronautical division of the Cantieri Riuniti of the Adriatic and later also the Aeronautica Macchi participated in the competition announcement. The Macchi M.C.77 was characterized by the central hull configuration with a single step and side floats, high-cantilever monoplane with cantilever, equipped with a motor in a pushing configuration positioned above the hull on a tubular castle. The structure was of mixed type with metal fuselage having the war load stowed inside on one side and the other. The project was presented to the Regia Aeronautica in 1934, to build the prototype already started, when the rival CANT Z.501 had already flown. The Air Force Genie, however, deemed the project interesting, but significant delays accumulated so that the prototype was only completed in 1935 and was not yet ready for the acceptance tests that were to take place in Nisida in August 1936. At this point, the Regia Aeronautica chose the Z.501 as the replacement for the S.78. The Macchi also built a scale model that presented to the public at the 1st Milan International Air Show in October 1935, but not getting feedback in the military aviation market decided to stop its development.

Cannon Mountain is part of The Enchantments, within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Cannon Mountain belongs to the Stuart Range which is subset of the Cascade Range. Cannon Mountain is situated one mile north of Enchantment Peak. The nearest higher peak is Dragontail Peak, to the southwest. Precipitation runoff drains into Icicle Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Cannon Mountain, north aspect The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

It is an erect, spreading shrub with narrow, prickly leaves and off-white, bell-like flowers with dark purple streaks. Description Pityrodia pungens is a straggling shrub which grows to a height of and has branches sometimes covered with star- like hairs. The leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, usually long, wide with a sharp point on the end. The flowers are arranged singly in upper leaf axils and are shorter than the leaves. There are leaf-like bracts and lance- shaped bracteoles long at the base of the flowers. The sepals are joined for less than half their length to form a bell-shaped tube with five lance-shaped, hairy lobes long. The five petals are off-white, long and joined to form a bell-like tube with five lobes on the end. The two upper lobes have dark purple streaks and are long and smaller than the lower lobes. The upper lobes are shorter than or about equal to the length of the sepals. The lower middle lobe is larger than the others. The petals are glabrous except for soft hairs on the outside of the petal lobes and a dense hairy ring below the stamens. The four stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the tube, the lower pair slightly longer than the other one. Flowering occurs mainly from January to June and is followed by an oval-shaped, hairy fruit about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Pityrodia pungens was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir from a specimen collected in the Nitmiluk National Park. The description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The specific epithet (pungens) is a Latin word meaning \\"sharp\\", \\"acrid\\", \\"biting\\" or \\"piercing\\". Distribution This pityrodia occurs in the northern part of the Northern Territory.

It was built by the Toggenburgerbahn (Toggenburg Railway; TB). Its 25 kilometre-long, standard gauge line from via Wattwil to Ebnat-Kappel was opened on 24 June 1870. The TB was nationalised as of 1 July 1902 and became part of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB).  History = Project development and construction = The old station building in Lichtensteig dates back to the construction period of the Toggenburg railway. With the construction of the Bodensee‚ÄìToggenburg railway, a new station with a new station building was built in 1910 where the lines diverge at the junction (Keilbahnhof). The old station is now used as a bistro. Train of the Toggenburg Railway in Lichtensteig, lithograph. Guggenloch Bridge near L√ºtisburg. The bridge, which was completed in 1875, was rebuilt in 1945 as a stone arch bridge. Steam locomotive E 3/3 number 1 \\"H√ºlftegg\\" of the Toggenburgerbahn After the opening of the St. Gallen‚ÄìWinterthur railway there were strong demands for a railway in the Toggenburg. As early as 1856, a planning commission founded on the initiative of industrialists led by Johann Rudolf Raschle commissioned a design for a Wil‚ÄìEbnat railway. An option that would have run from L√ºtisburg to Uzwil or Flawil was rejected for topographical and financial reasons. A detailed financial estimate amounting to Swiss francs (CHF) 6 million was compiled at the end of 1858. For a long time nothing was heard about the project. In 1864, the Bern construction company Wieland, Gubser & Cie. expressed interest in it. The railway committee provided the company with all of its documents. The canton of St. Gallen acquired shares worth CHF 2.5 million and CHF 1.5 million was subscribed by municipalities and private individuals. In 1868, the construction company agreed to build the railway together with all of the buildings on the line within two years for CHF 3 million. Three E 3/3 locomotives were built by Krauss & Co.. The official opening of the TB took place on 23 June 1870. The company was particularly proud of the 54.5 metre- high Guggenloch Bridge near L√ºtisburg. = Operations= The operation of the TB was carried out by the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB) until its nationalisation. Initially, four trains, later five, ran daily between Wil and Ebnat. The income from passenger and freight traffic was roughly in balance. The TB was a financially sound company and was able to pay dividends practically every year. = Nationalisation= In the run-up to nationalisation, projects were underway that provided for a connection between St. Gallen and the St. Gallen peninsula. The St. Gallen‚ÄìZug railway committee chose a route through the Toggenburg, which would also later allow direct access to the Gotthard Railway. The committee had already received a concession for this in 1890, but it could not finance the planned Ricken Tunnel. The canton of St. Gallen acquired the TB for CHF 2.75 million in 1901 and transferred it at no cost to the VSB. With the nationalisation of the VSB in 1902, the TB was integrated into the SBB. This virtually free transfer of the TB to the Federal Government was the financial contribution of the canton of St. Gallen to the construction of the CHF 12 million Ricken Tunnel. = Ricken Railway= The Uznach‚ÄìWattwil railway (Ricken Railway) from Wattwil to and connecting to the existing railway to Rapperswil was opened on 1 October 1910. The direct connection from Wattwil to St. Gallen was opened two days later by the Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn (BT). Even then, the former TB and the BT had several points of contact, so Lichtensteig and Wattwil stations were shared with the BT. In addition, there was a false double track between the two stations, as the lines of the SBB and the BT were laid next to each other. Functionally, the Toggenburg Railway was extended on 1 October 1912 by the BT line from Ebnat-Kappel to Nesslau-Neu St. Johann, which also meant that Ebnat- Kappel became a joint station. = Electrification = On 4 October 1926, there was an accident in the Ricken Tunnel (carbon monoxide poisoning of the train crew of a stopped freight train), which forced the SBB to electrify the tunnel immediately at 15 kV/16‚Öî (now 16.7) Hz AC and steam operation in the tunnel was prohibited as of 15 May 1927. The BT was thus also forced to electrify its line to restore through operations. Although the SBB did not prioritise the electrification of the Toggenburg Railway, BT wanted to switch completely to electric operation, but it was forced to lease the Wattwil‚ÄìEbnat section from the SBB to provide a continuous overhead line on its Ebnat- Kappel‚ÄìNesslau-Neu St. Johann section. Electrical operations on the St. Gallen‚ÄìWattwil‚ÄìNesslau-Neu St. Johann line commenced on 4 October 1931, which also meant that through trains could through the Ricken Tunnel. With the permanent lease of the Wattwil‚ÄìEbnat-Kappel section to the BT, the SBB retired from the operation of Ebnat-Kappel station at the same time. Steam traction lasted for twelve years on the remaining 20 km of the Toggenburg railway between Wil and Wattwil before electrical operations also started there on 12 December 1943. This removed the curiosity that only the BT track was electrified between Wattwil and Lichtensteig, while the SBB track was not. As part of the electrification, the Bazenheid and Dietfurt bridges were rebuilt in 1943. The new Guggenloch Bridge was opened in 1945. = Adjustment of property boundaries = In 1910, the BT was opened and the SBB opened the Ricken line to Uznach, so a larger entrance building had to be built in Wattwil. This became the property of SOB in 2005. The \\"wedge\\" station of Lichtensteig, on the left is the track of the SOB with a Stadler FLIRT (RABe 526), in the middle of the post bus to Krinau. The track of the Toggenburg Railway runs behind the station building. Limited double-track operations became possible on the Wattwil‚ÄìLichtensteig section after limited infrastructure adjustments in 1977/1978. With the merger of BT and the Schweizerischen S√ºdostbahn (SOB) on 1 January 2001‚Äîwhile maintaining the latter name‚Äîthe SOB became a contractual partner of the SBB. The contractually regulated use of the rail systems since the opening of BT was replaced in the Rail Reform 1 program by the so-called open-access network. In the course of 2005, SBB and SOB finally agreed on an adjustment of the ownership structure: the SBB ceded its share of Lichtensteig and Wattwil stations, terminated its lease of the Wattwil‚ÄìEbnat section and ceded the second track between Lichtensteig and Wattwil. In return, it received the SOB share of . With the transfers completed in 2006, the SBB now only retains the Wil‚ÄìLichtensteig section of the former Toggenburg Railway.  Operations GTW trains of Thurbo are used on the Wil‚ÄìWattwil route. From the electrification of the line until the commencement of the 2013 timetable, operations on the Wil‚ÄìNesslau- Neu St. Johann route were operated end to end. Rolling stock from the SBB and the BT was used. The SBB considered abandoning operations on the line in the 1970s. The line has been operated as line S9 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn since 2009. In preparation, the platforms at the stations of Bazenheid, B√ºtschwil and Dietfurt were raised and extended. An outer platform was built with a pedestrian underpass in B√ºtschwil, where the half-hourly trains cross. Bazenheid received a covered passenger shelter. A new computer-based interlocking was initially remotely controlled from St. Gallen. (replacement bus services are operating during upgrading between Wattwil and Nesslau-Neu St. Johann) Since the commencement of the 2013 timetable, Thurbo trains have run on the Wil‚ÄìWattwil section as line S9 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn at half- hour intervals. Some trains continue as line S10 to Weinfelden, but this is shown neither in the timetable nor on the platform displays. Thurbo trains run as line S8 from Nesslau-Neu St. Johann via St. Gallen and Kreuzlingen to . Services on the line from Wil to Nesslau-Neu St. Johann are set out in the Swiss timetable as table 853.

Written in 1963, this is one of his more well-known poems. It first appeared in the October 1963 edition of The New Yorker but was also included in several collections of his poetry, including Poems, 1957‚Äì1967, James Dickey: The Selected Poems, and Helmets: Poems.  Themes and critical analysis  This poem follows a male speaker who is meeting a forbidden lover in a junkyard. According to the critical analysis of his poetry as a whole, Dickey's writing is comparable to that of Robert Lowell, especially when examining \\"Cherrylog Road.\\" Dickey's poems usually relate to themes of self-hatred and self-pity, and almost always contain language relating to the American South, which is clear to see in this poem. Dickey pushes the poetic narrative and chooses to explore different poetic personas in poems like this and the others included in Poems, 1957‚Äì1967. The persona associated with his work in \\"Cherrylog Road\\" is that of a rebellious and sexual young man, which can be seen throughout multiple poems in that collection. One repeating motif throughout his poems is his use of comparing human and animal relations. Dickey continually attempts to use that comparison to balance the feelings of exultation and pure terror. Another piece of imagery that carries lots of weight in this poem is the car in which the two lovers meet in the junkyard. The car that appears as part of the narrative in \\"Cherrylog Road\\" has certainly been a subject of interest for critical review. In this poem, Dickey is able to manipulate the reader into believing that they are in this intimate space with him and the secondary character in the piece, Doris Holbrook. The car lets us into this tight space with the speaker, allowing us to better understand him and how he is \\"wild to be wreckage forever.\\" The car is used to showcase psychological and sexual closeness.

This food, drink and travel group also took part in charity activities. The group received widespread attention as a result of the Kerala government crackdown against it for promoting alcohol use and breaking other laws. Background The GNPC Facebook group administrator faced allegations and inquiries by the state excise department for promoting alcohol use. Excise commissioner Rishiraj Singh took action on this. Several posts in the group have been accused of promoting alcoholism. The founder admin of the group is T. L. Ajith Kumar,(Moothresh) who was arrested for promoting alcohol consumption including displaying the consumption of alcohol in front of children as well as organizing unlicensed parties which served liquor. His wife Vinitha is one of the admins as well. At the time of police action, the group had nearly 1.7 million members and it resulted in the creation of many copycat groups. The excise department and the police cyber cell requested Facebook to remove the group, but this was denied. Though some media outlets had reported that the group had indeed been taken down, it continues to operate under strict moderator oversight. GNPC is one of the Facebook secret groups with the maximum number of members. It claims to hold the world record for the same as well as for the highest number of comments on a Facebook post. However, there is no official confirmation of this record.

Early life Metropolitan Evloghios (from the left) alongside with another hierarchs of the Holy Synod of Milan Metropolitan Evloghios was born as Klaus-Augustin Hessler in 1935 in Dortmund, Province of Westphalia, Germany, in a German Roman Catholic family. In his youth, he studied philosophy and theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, in Rome, Italy. Because of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Klaus Hessler (his secular name) was received into the Russian Orthodox Church. Priesthood and Episcopacy Soon after his reception into the Orthodox Church, Klaus was tonsured a rassophore monk, receiving the name Evloghios, in 1970. In the same year, he was tonsured a reader, and then ordained a subdeacon, by Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh. In 1971, Evloghios was ordained deacon, and subsequently, a hieromonk, also by Metropolitan Anthony (Bloom). As a cleric of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Sourozh, Evloghios was sent to Italy to organize the religious and pastoral life of the parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Milan, Bologna, Lugano, Bergamo, Genova, Pavia Brescia and Modena. In 1975 he became an hegumen, and in 1982 he was elevated to the dignity of archimandrite. After some time, he entered a Greek Old Calendar jurisdiction (Genuine Orthodox Church of Greece - Auxentios Synod), where on 9 September 1984, he was consecrated to the episcopacy with the title of bishop of Milan, by Gabriel (Rocha), bishop of Lisbon and James, bishop of Coimbra and Aveiro. In 1985, the autonomous Metropolia of Western Europe, to which Evloghios belonged, emerges from the Auxentios Synod and begins an autonomous existence. In the same year, Evloghios was elevated to the rank of archbishop. During the final stages of negotiations between the hierarchy of Metropolia of Western Europe regarding its reception into the jurisdiction of the Polish Orthodox Church, Archbishop Evloghios expressed strong objections and on September 27, 1990, proclaimed the formation of a new jurisdiction, called the Orthodox Autonomous Metropolis of Western Europe (Holy Synod of Milan); from the date of formation he headed this organization in the rank of Metropolitan. In 1994, Metropolitan Evloghios visited the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kiev Patriarchate, and met with its head, Volodymyr (Romaniuk). The outcome of the talks was an agreement on the union of the Holy Synod of Milan with the UOC-KP, with an autonomous status. On March 20, 1994, the Kiev Patriarch Volodymyr (Romaniuk) issued a Tomos that proclaimed the act of establishing the Autonomous Western European Metropolis as part of the Kievan Patriarchate. The first-hierarch of the newly-formed autonomous church received the title of His Beatitude the Archbishop of Milan, Metropolitan of All Western Europe and Canada. After the election of Filaret (Denysenko) 1995 as Patriarch of Kiev and All Russia-Ukraine, mutual alienation between the leaders of these groups arose. Patriarch Filaret sent a telegram in 1996 to Metropolitan Evloghios demanding the latter to remove from his jurisdiction the Metropolia's parishes in the Americas, and also demanded that Metropolitan Evloghios stop wearing the patriarchal Koukoulion. In response to this telegram, the Synod of Milan ceased communication with Filaret (Denisenko) and the UOC-KP. On April 4, 2011, Metropolitan Evloghios, on behalf of the religious organization led by him, officially declared that the liturgical communion was broken with all non-canonical religious communities and expressed his desire to transfer to the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. There had been cases where clerics and communities of the Milan Synod had been received by the Russian Orthodox Church. On April 8, 2012, he renounced to the hierarchal rank which he had obtained while in schism and celebrated the Divine Liturgy in the rank of an archimandrite (his last rank while under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate). Metropolitan Evloghios‚Äô decision was allegedly motivated by his desire to leave his schismatic status and reunite with the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, of which he was once a clergyman. However, in July 2013, without waiting for a response from the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Evloghios, and his vicar bishop Avondios (Bica), returned to the episcopal rank, and renamed the Holy Synod of Milan the Orthodox Exarchate of Longobardia. During this process, they admitted into their ranks Vladimir (Fritsch), bishop of San Giulio D'Orta. At the synodal meeting on September 9, 2013, an independent synodal body was restored. Death On January 19, 2019, Metropolitan Evloghios was hospitalized in serious condition. He died on January 20, 2019. The website of the Metropolitan announced that from January 21 to January 26, the body of Metropolitan Evloghios would be in state. A requiem liturgy and funeral service was set for January 26, with burial at the Lambrate Cemetery, in Milan.

It was released on 12 October 2018. It is the lead single from her second studio album Hope, which was released on 7 June 2019. Upon release Mac told Billboard: \\"'Give Me My Name Back' is a song for those who have suffered emotional and physical abuse, it's for the women who are standing up and speaking out, those discriminated against in the LGBTQI community, the Indigenous people of Australia and the children abused by the church. It's for everyone who has lost an important part of themselves and need to reclaim their identity, dignity and self-worth in order to move forward with their lives.\\" Critical reception Al Newstead from ABC called the song her \\"most empowering anthem yet\\" saying \\"It's a bit of a change from the raw, vintage- sounding soul of her debut album, Low Blows. There's more space and synthetic sounds, all grounded by Meg's foundation-shifting set of pipes. The result is a rallying cry, an empowering anthem encouraging others to join in solidarity and take a stand.\\" Matthew Forbes from Outlet Mag said: \\"'Give Me My Name Back' achieves its desire for a wide-reaching message through its direct and all-encompassing lyricism, which are given even more weight by Meg's characteristically enthralling vocal performance. The track ventures forward in time from the vintage soul that defined her debut album to the more synthetic and futuristic territory she's explored on tracks like \\"Grandma‚Äôs Hands\\", resulting in an instrumental that's rich in texture. Despite this, the song, much like its lyrics, is at its most powerful in the simple moments ‚Äì specifically, the bridge, in which the instrumental is reduced to a drum beat, letting the stirring lyrics and gorgeous harmonies take the forefront.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Give Me My Name Back\\" was produced, directed and edited by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and released on 11 October 2018. The music video had an all-female cast and crew. Charts { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! Chart (2018) !

Biography  Theodora Lois Sherman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Harry Sherman and Lillian Mazur. She spent her childhood traveling the country, and eventually went to a finishing school on the East Coast. Afterward, she studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse for four years. In the early 1940s, she arrived in Hollywood. Her father had become a successful producer, known for Hopalong Cassidy films. Not wanting to capitalize off his name, she used the stage name of Gayle Lord. While her father was out of town, she auditioned for a role on a Hopalong Cassidy. When she got the part, her father insisted she use her real name. She appeared in a few films her father produced and was popular as an actress, but found she enjoyed writing. In 1946, she was named assistant story editor at her father's independent production studio, Enterprise Pictures, where she wrote half a dozen Westerns (including the Gary Cooper film) as well as dozens of television episodes. She collaborated on several scripts with writer Graham Baker. She was reportedly engaged to actor Rod Cameron at one point in the early '40s, but that never led to marriage. She was also engaged to her father's assistant, Vernon Clark, in the late '40s, but that was called off. In 1957, she married Allan Baylin. The pair had a daughter together. Sherman died on January 16, 2019, at the age of 97 due to natural causes.

Bar scene but is now more commonly served as a Tiki drink. The original recipe calls for shaking the ingredients with ice in 2:1:1 proportions, although many later variations have modified the ratio to greater emphasize the calvados as the base ingredient (4:1:1). Historical origin Belgian bartender Robert Vermiere is credited with creating the Diki-Diki, who listed it in his book Cocktails: How to Mix Them, along with a notation that he introduced the cocktail at London's Embassy Club in February 1922. Fellow cocktail book author Harry McElhone commented that \\"this is a very popular cocktail in London\\" in his 1923 drink manual Harry of Ciro's ABC of Mixing Cocktails. McElhone's listing employed the more calvados-oriented version with a 4:1:1 ratio. This was also the proportion used in Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide and Harry Cradock's Savoy Cocktail Book . Modern-day usage The Diki- Diki is currently served primarily in Tiki bars, and as an example has been on the drink menu at the Tiki Ti. There is some disagreement over whether the Diki-Diki should be considered as a true tiki drink. Because of the era it was created in, the Diki-Diki could not have been considered as an express tiki drink as first envisioned because the Polynesian inspired tiki craze had not yet started. However, Vermiere did employ an interesting backstory when he created the cocktail by stating that it was named after the \\"chief monarch of the Island Ubian (Southern Philippines), who is now 37 years old, weighs 23 pounds, and his height is 32 inches\\". While likely a fictionalisation, there nevertheless was a real life Philippine leader named Lapu-Lapu, who was responsible for the death of Ferdinand Magellan and for whom a later tiki drink has been named after. The Lapu-Lapu cocktail has been served alongside the Diki-Diki cocktail at the Tiki Ti. The Puka-Puka cocktail, named after the Polynesian atoll \\"discovered\\" by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 is also a tiki drink. As such one may wish to consider the shared folklore of the Diki-Diki cocktail as an inspiration of sorts for the names of the Lapu-Lapu and Puka- Puka tiki cocktails. Tiki pioneer Victor Bergeron, who named his first restaurant Hinky Dinks, included the recipe for the Diki-Diki cocktail in his bartender's guide.

It is owned and operated by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is signed E5A as an extension of the Hokkaido Expressway under the \\"2016 Proposal for Realization of Expressway Numbering.\\" Route description Officially, the current (as of January 2019) section of expressway open is known as the Hakodate-Moheji Road. It is long. The speed limit is set at 100 km/h along its entirety. With the exception of a short section at Hakodate Junction, the expressway only has one lane in each direction. The roads northern terminus is at an interchange with Hakodate Shind≈ç, a southern extension of the Hokkaido Expressway. From here the road travels west out of Hakodate and in to Hokuto. Upon entering Hokuto it has a junction with Japan National Route 227. It then crosses the Kunebetsu and ≈åno rivers before another junction, this time with Hokkaido Route 96. From here, the route curves to the southwest, roughly paralleling the Hokkaido Shinkansen rail line, while the older Esashi Line winds back and forth alongside the expressway. The expressway abruptly meets in temporary southern terminus at Hokkaido Route 1167 in the southern part of Hokuto near Moheji Station. History The expressway was first opened between Hakodate Junction and Hokuto-ch≈´≈ç Interchange in 2003. At the time of construction, the open interchanges in Hokuto had different names. Those interchanges were renamed Hokuto-Oiwake and Hokuto-ch≈´≈ç in October 2009. Shortly after, in November of the same year, the expressway was extended to Hokuto-Tomigawa. Most recently, in March of 2012 the expressway was extended to Hokuto-Moheji. Future Construction is underway to extend the expressway to Kikonai; however, progress was delayed due to the finding of J≈çmon period relics in the construction area. The expected completion date for this extension is 2021.

He introduced the character Hopalong Cassidy to the silver screen, and is the father of screenwriter Teddi Sherman.  Biography  Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Sherman had an early love for film (Westerns in particular), working as a theater owner on the East Coast while starting his family. In 1913, while seeking movies to show at his theater, he traveled to Hollywood and met D.W. Griffith; Sherman ended up giving Griffith a loan for the money needed to complete Birth of a Nation. Sherman arrived in Hollywood full-time in 1926, and worked at both Pathe and MGM before striking out on his own as an independent producer. He brought the popular Hopalong Cassidy character to the big screen in 1935, and would go on to produce 50+ more films in the series before turning duties over to Hopalong actor William Boyd. Sherman took pride in his clean-cut stories and righteous characters. He died in 1952 after entering the hospital for abdominal surgery.

Its plot follows a mentally- unstable plastic surgeon who transforms a young accident victim to appear as his missing daughter. It had the working title False Face. Plot Phillip Reynolds is a widowed plastic surgeon who, despite having had a brilliant career, suffers in his interpersonal relationships. After the death of his millionaire father-in-law, Phillip discovers that both he and his brother-in- law, Bradley, have been written out of the will. The deceased patriarch blames Phillip for his daughter's death, and bequeaths the entirety of his $5 million estate to his granddaughter (Phillip's daughter), Heather. However, since the death of her boyfriend Donald the year prior, Heather has gone missing and no one in the family has been in contact with her. While out driving with Bradley, Phillip comes across a stripper who has been severely beaten by a nightclub bouncer. Phillip brings her to the hospital, and devises a plan to alter her face to the likeness of Heather; he promises to split Heather's $5 million inheritance with the Jane Doe if she consents to pose as Heather. The woman, whom Phillip refers to as \\"Jane,\\" agrees to the plan, and awakens from the surgery in a face cast some months later. Phillip brings her to his home where he attempts to coach her to act like his daughter, playing recordings of Heather's voice and teaching her Heather's mannerisms. After Jane fully recovers, Phillip holds a family party to celebrate Heather's \\"return,\\" and to see if Jane can successfully convince the family members that she is Heather. At the party, Bradley is suspicious when Jane refuses to play piano, as Heather was a musical prodigy. During the party, Bradley suffers a heart attack and dies. At his funeral in New Orleans, the real Heather appears, and watches the proceedings from afar. She arrives at her father's home, and is met by him and Jane, whose striking resemblance to her she takes immediate note of. In the ensuing weeks, Heather grows disturbed by her father's apparent sexual interest in Jane, while Jane becomes jealous of the bond Phillip has with Heather. Phillip and Jane go swimming together at a nearby lake, and are stopped after by a police officer who requests identification. Jane flees into the woods, but is eventually caught by the officer. Phil returns to the house and first tells Heather that Jane drowned at the lake, then changes his story and claims to have killed her himself. He then attempts to rape Heather, but is stopped by Jane, who appears in the doorway donning the police officer's uniform, and beats him with a cast iron skillet. Heather and Jane embrace, and Heather injects her father with a truth serum before explaining that for the past year, she had been staying in a sanitarium owned by Dr. Dean, a family friend. She explains that she entered the sanitarium after witnessing Phillip murder Donald, which caused her to suffer a nervous breakdown. Her grandfather was the only member of the family who knew where she was. Dr. Dean, who had met Jane on a previous occasion and knew she was not Heather, arrives at the house, and sedates Phillip. Several other doctors arrive and place Phillip in a straitjacket before taking him to the sanitarium. Jane departs the house with the medical staff, leaving Heather and Dean together in an embrace. As Phillip is incarcerated in the sanitarium, Jane is met by the family's lawyers at the airport, and receives her $2.5 million before departing on a private jet.

Release Scalpel was released theatrically in January 1977, and re-released on June 6, 1979. =Home media= Arrow Films released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on February 27, 2018. Reception Scalpel received mixed reviews from critics upon its release, with some critics noting the film's unevenness, and the climactic twist as being \\"unconvincing\\". Dennis Schwartz of Ozus‚Äô World Movie Reviews gave the film a C+, calling the film \\"uneven\\" and criticized the finale, while also noting that the film was still entertaining in a goofy way. Terror Trap rated the film two and a half out of four stars, noting that, although it was easier to follow than other similar films and commended Chapman's performance, the reviewer felt that the film's premise was fully utilized as it should have been. Alternately, Budd Wilkins of Slant Magazine awarded the film a more positive four out of five stars, writing, \\"As a slice of sordid Southern gothic nastiness, shot through with a vein of mordant black humor, Scalpel is a cut above.\\" References External links  Category:1977 films Category:1970s horror thriller films Category:1977 independent films Category:1970s psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Louisiana Category:Films set in Atlanta Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Southern Gothic films ","title":"Scalpel (film)"},{"id":"59736365","text":"Helen Lee is a medical researcher and the winner of the European Inventor Award 2016 in the Popular Prize category for inventing diagnostic kits for resource-poor regions of the globe.

As a member of the NISHAD Party, he won the seat in the 2017 state assembly elections. In March 2018, he was expelled from that party, despite being its only Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), when he supported a candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in elections to the Rajya Sabha. The party allied with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and had ordered him to support the BSP candidate, Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Mishra is being detained by UP Police under a charges of extortion and land-grapping and trespassing. Mishra had been a member of the Samajwadi Party (SP), for whom he successfully contested in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 assembly elections. Described in 2007 by the Hindustan Times as a \\"mafia\\", he had at that time over 30 pending criminal cases lodged against him. He contested the 2012 election while in jail in relation to an alleged involvement in the 2010 bomb attack on Nand Gopal Gupta (also known as Nand Gopal Nandi),who was minister of state at that time (2010) and was chosen as cabinet minister in yogi adityanath's government.. Denying the charges as being politically motivated, he was released on bail later in the year, by which time 62 criminal cases were recorded against him. His family had anticipated his release would occur if the SP were returned to government. The SP said it expelled Mishra in 2017 for \\"anti-party activities\\", when he had decided to contest the 2017 elections as an independent candidate due to the SP not adopting him. Other members of his family were expelled at the same time, including his wife, Ramlali Mishra, who was a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council. Mishra says that he resigned, together with many of his supporters. Mishra and his daughter, Seema, who was then contesting a Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 Indian general election, were both provided with armed protection officers for a period up to April 2014, when the courts ordered that this measure, financed by the Uttar Pradesh government, was illegal. It ruled that such protection could not be given to people with a criminal history. Mishra was born on 7 September 1957 in Khaptiha (Allahabad). His official parliamentary biography describes him as a Brahmin, with one son and five daughters.

Government shutdowns in the United States have occurred periodically since 1980, and are the result of failure to pass appropriations bills before the previous ones expire. Shutdowns of the type experienced by the United States are nearly impossible in other forms of government. The most recent shutdown happened in December 2018. * Under the parliamentary systems used in most European nations, stalemates within the government are less likely, but the executive must maintain the approval of the legislature to remain in power (confidence and supply), and typically an election is triggered if a budget fails to pass (loss of supply). * In other presidential systems, the executive branch typically has the authority to keep the government functioning even without an approved budget. United Kingdom Until the passage of the Fixed- Term Parliaments Act in 2011, government shutdowns in the United Kingdom were impossible due to parliamentary convention. A government which could not command a majority in Parliament would be dismissed, either prior to the seating of Parliament when the Queen's Speech was voted down or later, when a vote of no confidence was tabled and passed, when a Finance Act was voted down, or when a major bill was voted down. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act, however, abolished these conventions, ensuring that the only way to call new elections was either for the explicit passage of a vote of no confidence or a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons calling for a new election. This has led to speculation that a government shutdown is now possible, with the government holding the House standing through tabled Votes of No Confidence but failing to pass legislation due to internal fighting or the breakdown of a coalition. An American-style shutdown was also considered to be on the table in the context of Brexit, as some MP's proposed an amendment to \\"starve the government of cash\\" and create a \\"Donald Trump-style shutdown\\" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. =Northern Ireland= In January 2017 the Assembly of Northern Ireland a power-sharing agreement collapsed, resulting in the national parliament being unable to pass bills, including critical spending bills. In December, this ongoing event almost resulted in an American-style shutdown, with regional civil services set to run out of money within days, but such a shutdown was averted when the British Government stepped in to keep local services funded. United States Government shutdowns, in United States politics, refer to a funding gap period that causes a full or partial shutdown of federal government operations and agencies. They are caused when there is a failure to pass a funding legislation to finance the government for its next fiscal year or a temporary funding measure. Ever since a 1980 interpretation of the 1884 Antideficiency Act, a ‚Äúlapse of appropriation‚Äù due to a political impasse on proposed appropriation bills requires that the US federal government curtail agency activities and services, close down non- essential operations, furlough non-essential workers, and only retain essential employees in departments covering the safety of human life and/or protection of property.The Odd Story of the Law That Dictates How Government Shutdowns Work Voluntary services in these respective essential areas may only be accepted during emergencies. Shutdowns are also possible at occurring within and disrupting state, territorial, and local levels of government. As of , since the enactment of the US government's current budget and appropriations process in 1976, there have been a total of 22 funding gaps in the federal budget, of which 10 of these have led to federal employees being furloughed. Prior to 1980, funding gaps did not lead to government shutdowns, until Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued a legal opinion requiring the government be shut down when a funding gap occurs.Make government shutdowns impossible again - The Week This opinion was not consistently adhered to through the 1980s, but since 1990 all funding gaps lasting longer than a few hours have led to a shutdown. Some of the most significant shutdowns in U.S. history have included the 21-day shutdown of 1995‚Äì1996 during the Bill Clinton administration over opposition to major spending cuts; the 16-day shutdown in 2013 during the Barack Obama administration caused by a dispute over implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019 during the Donald Trump administration, the longest shutdown in US history, caused by a dispute over the funding amount for an expansion of the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border barrier. Shutdowns cause the disruption of government services and programs, including the closure of national parks and institutions (in particular, due to shortages of federal employees). A major loss of government revenue comes from lost labor from furloughed employees who are still paid, as well as loss of fees that would have been paid during the shutdown. Shutdowns also cause a significant reduction in economic growth (depending on the length of the shutdown). During the 2013 shutdown, Standard & Poor's, the financial ratings agency, stated on 16 October that the shutdown had \\"to date taken $24 billion out of the economy\\", and \\"shaved at least 0.6 percent off annualized fourth-quarter 2013 GDP growth\\".

The committee was supposed to submit its final report to the federal government on 1 February 2019. Submission of the recommended measures on social and structural development and financing of States, in which brown coal is extracted, was expected by the end of October 2018. These measures should include climate change mitigation policy measures, especially a fossil fuel phase-out plan with a target phase- out date and measures to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction goal by 2020 Germany has committed to. The commission's report was published in January 2019 recommending Germany to entirely phase out and shut down the 84 remaining coal-fired plants on its territory by 2038. While this was applauded as a success by some, others, including scientists and climate experts, argued that this still would not be fast enough, and that to prevent the climate from reaching an irreversible tipping point, the phase out must have happenend by 2030 already.

Land grants given to Brahmins were organized into sanketams, which formed semi- autonomous, self governing bodies. According to M.T. Narayanan, the sanketam was the primary institution through which the Nambudiri Brahmins exerted their influence on the politics of Kerala. They were the predominant landowning agency of the feudal age, exercising revenue and judicial power. In the region of the sanketam, all temporal authorities were exercised by the temple officials and the local chieftains wielded no control. M.T. Narayanan classifies sanketams as grama sanketams, which formed the original 32 Brahmin settlements of Kerala and kshetra sanketams, which referred to fresh settlements. Shneider and Gough distinguish four types of temples among the upper castes of Kerala. The first of these were the temples belonging to sanketams, whose estates were managed by Nambudiris. These temples were dedicated to pan-India Hindu deities like Siva or Vishnu. Animal sacrifices were forbidden within the temples of the sanketams and they were restricted to the Brahmin population of the village. The priests of these temples were often lower ranking Nambudiri priests.A few temple-servant castes also used to live in these sanketams. Second were the private temples owned by Nambudiris which were smaller versions of the first. The third and fourth kinds of temples belonged to royal matrilineal lineages and the \\"common\\" Nair families and these were often dedicated to Bhagavathi or Bhadrakali.  Governance  The governance of the temple-state was carried out by the body of the yogam, which consisted of the heads (eldest male) of all Brahmin households belonging to the designated region. These members (yogakkar) elected a committee of ooralans (heads of certain Nambudiri households) and a chief, who exercised supreme authority within the confines of the sanketam. The chief (sankethaadhikari) who was usually a kshatriya was appointed by the Brahmin head of the yogam (known as the yogathiri). In this way, the sanketam functioned independent of the existing political structure of the area (which may be ruled by a naduvazhi or a desavazhi). A sanketam could also have several smaller satellite temples (keezhedams) operating under its nominal control, in which case, consent for certain events had to sought from the parent temple.

Description Boronia obovata is an erect, many-branched shrub which grows to a height of with its branches covered, sometimes densely covered with white to yellow hairs. The leaves usually have three leaflets, except for those on seedlings and short branches which are simple leaves. The leaves have a petiole long. The middle leaflet is long and wide, the side leaflets smaller, long and wide. The leaflets are elliptic to lance-shaped, with the narrower end towards the base and have a few to many star-like hairs. The edges of the leaflets are turned down or rolled under. Up to three pink flowers are arranged in leaf axils on a hairy stalk long. The four sepals are long, about wide and hairy on their lower side. The four petals are long, wide. Flowering occurs from January to September and the fruit which are long, wide are mature several months later. Taxonomy and naming Boronia obovata was first formally described in 1942 by Cyril Tenison White and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland from a specimen collected by Henry George Simmons. The specific epithet (obovata) is derived from the Latin word ovatus meaning \\"egg-shaped\\" with the prefix ob- meaning \\"reverse\\".

He was executed for treason for attempting to display royal portraits for sale on the town's gallows. Background Archibald Cornwall is prominent in records of the Edinburgh Baillie's court which detail his weekly role as a court officer. He confiscated and marketed clothes and household goods belonging to defaulting debtors. Confiscated goods were displayed at the Mercat Cross on the Royal Mile and sold to the highest bidder, to reimburse creditors who had obtained an order called a \\"decreet\\" from the baillies. The Scots words for confiscation were \\"poynding\\" or \\"apprysing\\", the sale or auction, \\"comprysing\\", or a \\"roup\\".The record of the court is known as the \\"Register of Decreets\\" and is preserved in Edinburgh City Archives, SL234, and records many instances of Archibald Cornwall's work as a court officer. Cornwall also worked with the goldsmith George Heriot.Inventory of Original Documents in the Archives of George Heriot's Hospital (Edinburgh, 1857), p. 20 'Derectione for Cornelle mershell.' Hanging the King and Queen's portraits On 15 April 1601 Archibald was displaying confiscated household goods including the portraits of James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark at the cross and was seen to be standing on a table about to hang the pictures on two nails on the gallows or gibbet. He was stopped by a crowd of passers-by who threatened to stone him. The English diplomat George Nicholson wrote that displaying the paintings there was accounted \\"an ill presage\\" and a \\"dishonour to the king\\". Cornwall was arrested and later accused of the \\"Ignominious Dishonouring and Defaming of his Majesties\\". On 17 April Edinburgh Town Council passed an act against the sale of the portraits of the king or queen in private or public, and informed the king who was at Dalkeith Palace. Archibald was found guilty by an assize composed of Edinburgh tailors and condemned to be hung on Monday 27 April and remain on the same gibbet for 24 hours. Afterwards the gallows were burnt.Robert Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials in Scotland vol. 2 part 2 (Edinburgh 1833), pp.349-351: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 809, 814. On 19 June 1601 James VI restored his possessions to his widow Janet Cheyne by privy seal letter.Register of the Privy Seal, NRS PS1/72 170v. The Edinburgh diarist Robert Birrell recorded the execution, and also suggested that Cornwall was unpopular in Edinburgh, perhaps for auctioning townspeople's household goods; > He being an unmerciful greiddie creatur, he poyndit ane hones manis hous, > and, amongst the rest, he poyndit the King and Queinis picturis, and quhen > he came to the crosse to compryse the same he hung thame up on two naillis > on the same gallowis > > He being an unmerciful greedy creature, he confiscated an honest man's > house, and among the rest, he took the King and Queen's pictures, and when > he came to the Cross to auction them, he hung them on two nails on the > gallows.'The Diarey (sic) of Robert Birrell', in John Graham Dalyell, > Fragments of Scottish History (Edinburgh, 1798), p. 54. This harsh judgement and execution is usually regarded as motivated by the King's strong desire in these years to protect his reputation in the light of the English succession, beyond the usual limits of justice and equity, and has been linked with other cases where those who slandered him were executed. The case also shows that copies of Scottish royal portraits, now very rare, were not uncommon in Edinburgh houses. Portraits may have been made following the works of Adrian Vanson, the official court painter. Edinburgh town council ordered that in future royal portraits should not be auctioned, publicly or privately, as the result of a law suit.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 284.

The objectives of the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland are toFOEN: Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring BDM. Description of Methods and Indicators. Environmental Studies No. 1410, Federal Office for the Environment FOEN, Bern, 2014. * draw representative conclusions about biodiversity in Switzerland as a whole (sometimes broken down by biogeographic region or main type of land use, e.g. grassland, forests, settlements etc.); * monitor the evolution of species diversity as a whole, i.e. including in intensively used areas and therefore draw conclusions about the common landscape; * record the taxonomic groups in full, i.e. including all species, and thus supplement existing knowledge on rare and endangered species; * document changes in species diversity and highlight long-term trends.  Methodology  1-km2 sampling area for the ‚Äúspecies diversity in landscapes‚Äù indicator with a transect marked 10-m2 sampling area for the ‚Äúspecies diversity in habitats‚Äù indicator The Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland comprises three sampling grids on different scales, which cover the whole of Switzerland and yield a representative sample. The sampling grid to observe species diversity in landscapes consists of some 450 sampling areas, each covering one square kilometre. On a precisely defined transect of this quadrant, vascular plants, butterflies and breeding birds are surveyed. Data on breeding birds are collected by the Swiss Ornithological Institute Sempach. These surveys are coordinated with the Monitoring of Common Breeding Birds.Monitoring of Common Breeding Birds. Website of the Swiss Ornithological Institute Sempach. Retrieved 2019-01-22. The density of the sampling grid in the Jura and in Southern Switzerland was increased in order to obtain reliable data for these regions. The sampling grid to observe species diversity in habitats consists of some 1,450 sampling sites, each covering ten square metres. In terms of habitats a distinction is drawn between forests, dry meadows and pastures, settlements, farmland, alpine pastures and mountain areas. All the vascular plants found in a circular sampling area are surveyed. In addition, bryophyte samples are collected, which are subsequently identified by a team of experts, and soil samples are taken to study mollusc diversity in the laboratory. The sampling grid to survey aquatic insects comprises approximately 500 small sections of minor watercourses measuring around 5‚Äì100 metres long. It surveys the larvae of mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies (so-called EPT species group).

A fifth of all areas are surveyed every year, which means that a survey is repeated at the same location every five years. Routine surveys of vascular plants, bryophytes, molluscs and breeding birds were started in 2001, with surveys of butterflies added in 2003 and aquatic invertebrates added in 2010.

Indicators  The data obtained are routinely used to calculate four indicators:BDM Coordination Unit: Sample Design of Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland (BDM). Report, 2011.Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland. Website of Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP). Retrieved 2019-03-04. * The species diversity in landscapes indicator shows the diversity of flora and fauna in the landscape. It describes the influence of habitat mosaics on species diversity. * The species diversity in habitats indicator documents the small-scale species diversity of a habitat type, e.g. dry meadows, forests or settlements. * The population size of common species indicator documents changes in widespread species. They are of ecological importance as they make up the majority of living biomass, provide a significant share of ecosystem services and constitute an abundant food source for other organisms. They shape the appearance of their habitats and characterise entire landscapes. * The diversity in species communities indicator looks at whether Switzerland's habitats and landscapes are becoming more similar. It therefore provides information on the heterogeneity or homogeneity of species diversity. In addition, the data can be used for various special analyses. They form the basis of numerous scientific research projects.BDM Coordination Unit: Scientific Publications. List of all scientific publications. Thanks to the systematic sampling design, the standardised methodology and the long-term nature of the programme, the data can also be used to answer new, as yet undefined questions. The data are also incorporated in European biodiversity indicators, e.g. the European Grassland Butterfly Index compiled by Butterfly Conservation Europe Van Swaay, C.A.M. et al. (2016).

Distinctive features of the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland The specific contribution of the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland to the analysis of species diversity in Switzerland is the fact that species lists can be drawn up that are as comprehensive as possible for all sampling areas, which increases the probability of detecting species absences. In addition, the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland is not restricted to well-known, highly species-rich areas or sites where rarities are found, but rather monitors randomly selected locations that would hardly ever be surveyed otherwise. Common and widespread species are thus also surveyed. Repeat surveys at exactly the same location using exactly the same method allow precise conclusions to be drawn regarding changes in species diversity. Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland provides a cross section of the overall landscape covering a wide variety of uses. It serves as a reference for programmes that study the development of selected habitats or of specific rare species, e.g. the project ‚ÄúMonitoring the effectiveness of habitat conservation in Switzerland‚Äù (WBS), launched by the FOEN and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), and Switzerland's Red Lists.Rote Listen der Schweiz.

Story  Eva's father is in West India and Eva's mother is hospitalized because she has tuberculosis. Therefore, Eva lives with her Aunt Ester. She has a doll named Via-Lisa, who she loves more than anything else. Via-Lisa is the only one who gives comfort to Eva. Eva's cousin Berit is mean to Eva and bullies Eva whenever she can. Berit calls Via-Lisa Dirt Doll and steals her from Eva over and over again. She also keeps saying that Eva's mother is about to die and that Eva's father will drown in the sea. For Eva's aunts Greta and Ester, Eva is a \\"nasty little thing\\", that is as bad as they think Eva's mother was and is. They do not want to see that Berit is the one that bullies Eva. Eva's aunts just take care of Eva because they have to and want to get rid of her as soon as possible. Berit is treated by her aunts like a little angel and Eva is treated like piece of crap. When Berit behaves badly, Eva is usually blamed for it. During thunderstorms with pouring rain, Eva is sent to the city to get potato flour. It's a long way to go. When Eva, arrives at the shop, she is drenched and trembling with cold. The merchant Eriksson is horrified that her aunt have sent Eva such a long way just to get potato flour during this weather. He takes care of Eva, warms her up and gives her a candy. Eva asks Eriksson what kind of illness tuberculosis is and whether one can die of it. Eriksson says you can die of it, but he says that Eva's mother will not die of it. He adds that her mother will soon be very well and can take Eva home. That makes Eva happy and gives her new courage. Happily, she runs home. She sees that Berit has thrown her beloved doll Via-Lisa into the dirt. Angrily, she slams the flour on the table, into her aunts and cousin's faces and tells them that she doesn't care about anyone of them. Then Eva jumps around happily with her doll.

The aircraft was travelling from Nantes, France, to Cardiff, Wales. The wreckage of the aircraft was found thirteen days later on the seabed at a depth of . On 7 February, Sala's body was recovered from the wreckage. No trace of the pilot has been found. Disappearance The aircraft departed from Nantes Atlantique Airport at 19:15 GMT (20:15 CET) bound for Cardiff Airport. Sala had been signed two days previously by Cardiff City Football Club from FC Nantes. The pilot was identified by Guernsey Police as David Ibbotson. Shortly before contact with Jersey air traffic control was lost, a request was made by the pilot to descend from to , in order to maintain visual meteorological conditions. Contact was lost when the aircraft was at an altitude of . At 20:23 GMT, Guernsey Coastguard received an alert from Jersey air traffic control saying that a plane had gone off the radar around north of Guernsey. The plane was then around northwest of Alderney, Channel Islands, near Casquets lighthouse. Sala reportedly sent an audio message via WhatsApp expressing concerns during the flight, saying \\"I am now on board a plane that seems like it is falling to pieces... If you do not have any more news in an hour and a half, I don't know if they need to send someone to find me. I am getting scared!\\" Cardiff City had offered Sala a commercial flight from Paris, but he said that he had made alternative arrangements and would be training with his teammates on the morning after the flight. The flight was arranged by football agent Willie McKay, who said that he was not involved in selecting the plane or the pilot. It was reported in French media that the flight was arranged through pilot David Henderson, who had originally intended to fly the plane, but the flight had been given to David Ibbotson. The flight plan showed that the plane was scheduled to take off at 09:00 GMT (10:00 CET) on 21 January, but was delayed until the evening. Aircraft N264DB, the Piper Malibu involved, photographed in 2017 The aircraft involved was a Piper PA-46 Malibu, a six-seat type equipped with a single piston engine, registered in the United States as N264DB, serial number 46-8408037. The aircraft was manufactured in 1984. The Certificate of Registration had been issued on 11 September 2015. The aircraft was registered to a trustee, the Southern Aircraft Consultancy in Bungay, Suffolk, United Kingdom. Search  A search and rescue operation was launched, but was suspended at 02:00 GMT on 22 January due to worsening weather conditions. Although the area was outside the United Kingdom's area of responsibility, Her Majesty's Coastguard sent two helicopters to assist in the search for the aircraft. A French helicopter was also sent to participate in the search, as were the Alderney and Guernsey lifeboats. The search resumed at 08:00 GMT on 22 January. By 11:45 GMT, a total of had been covered by five aircraft and two lifeboats, but no trace of the aircraft had been found. A French Navy vessel also participated in the search. As of 15:30 GMT on 22 January, one aircraft and one lifeboat were still searching, bringing the total area covered to . The search was again suspended in the evening of 22 January. Floating objects had been found, but it was not confirmed that they came from the missing aircraft. The search resumed at 08:00 GMT on 23 January with two aircraft searching coastal areas around Alderney. As of 11:30 GMT, a helicopter and three aircraft were continuing the search and trying to review satellite imagery and mobile phone data; there was still no trace of the missing aircraft. On 23 January, the Channel Islands Air Search said they had abandoned hope of finding any survivors in the water. The search now focused on the possibility that survivors were on a life raft in the English Channel. The official search was called off on 24 January because the chances of survival were said to be \\"extremely remote\\". The search had covered of land and sea, covering Burhou, Les Casquets, Alderney, the north coast of the Cherbourg Peninsula, and the north coast of Jersey and Sark.  Salvage activity Sala's family launched a fundraising appeal to find his body and a private search was launched on 26 January, funded by ¬£259,000 raised in donations, via a specialised organisation. On 28 January, marine scientist David Mearns, who led the search, announced that a search vessel with an unmanned remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) was expected to be in place \\"by the end of the week\\". They planned to focus on some of the seabed; the last known position of the aircraft was north of Hurd's Deep. In the meantime, two fishing boats were being used to carry out a surface search of the area. Mearns engaged the FPV Morven for the search. On 30 January 2019, at approximately 13:58 GMT, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) reported that two seat cushions, found near Surtainville in France, were likely to be from the missing aircraft. AAIB identified a priority search area of approximately and commissioned a survey vessel from the British Ministry of Defence with sonar equipment to search the seabed for the aircraft. The AAIB search carried out by the vessel Geo Ocean III started on 3 February, together with the private search, and was expected to last up to three days; the private search was set to continue \\"until the plane is located\\". The planned search was to cover an area of about north of Guernsey. The search area was divided between the two teams. On 3 February, wreckage of the aircraft was found on the seabed at about from the last known location. The wreckage was at a depth of and there was a possibility that the bodies of Sala and Ibbotson were still on board. On 4 February, it was confirmed that the image from the AAIB search remote submersible had shown the registration mark and at least one body inside the wreckage. On 7 February, a body was recovered from the wreckage and was taken to the Isle of Portland to be passed to the Dorset coroner, where it was identified as that of Sala, by means of fingerprint evidence. Attempts to recover the aircraft wreckage were unsuccessful and poor weather conditions forced the salvage team to return the ROV to the ship. On 11 February, the results of a post-mortem reported that Sala had died of \\"head and trunk injuries\\". The daughter of the pilot David Ibbotson launched a crowdfunding appeal to locate his body and on 10 February the fund received a donation of ¬£27,000 from French footballer Kylian Mbapp√©. Former England captain Gary Lineker also donated ¬£1,000. , ¬£249,000 of the ¬£300,000 target had been raised. The search was to include a dive to the wreck to rule out the body being there, and a helicopter search of coastal areas in the Channel Islands. On 27 February, it was reported that a 20-minute dive to the wreck had discovered no body. Investigation The crash site lays in international waters. Under Annex 13 to the Convention on Civil Aviation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had responsibility for investigating the accident because the aircraft was registered in the United States. The NTSB, in agreement with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) delegated responsibility for the investigation to the AAIB as they represented the country the aircraft was being operated in. On 23 January 2019, the AAIB opened an investigation into the accident. Assistance was given by France's Bureau d‚ÄôEnqu√™tes et d‚ÄôAnalyses, the British Civil Aviation Authority, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, Argentina's Junta de Investigaci√≥n de Accidentes de Aviaci√≥n Civil and the NTSB. Part of the investigation covered the operational aspects related to the accident including licensing and flight plans. It was reported that David Ibbotson held a private pilot licence, which would not have permitted him to carry passengers for profit, or to arrange a flight with the sole purpose of carrying a passenger. It was additionally reported that while at Nantes Atlantique Airport, Ibbotson had posted on Facebook that he was \\"a bit rusty\\" with the instrument landing system on the Piper Malibu. Ibbotson had undergone training to become a commercial pilot between 2012 and 2014, but had dropped out before it was completed. On 30 March, it was reported that Ibbotson suffered from colour blindness, which meant that he was disqualified from holding a night flying rating on his pilot's licence. After confirming on 4 February that the wreckage of the aircraft had been located, the AAIB stated that it would publish an interim report on their findings within two weeks. A Special Bulletin was issued on 25 February 2019. On 14 August, it was reported that post mortem tests on Sala's body showed exposure to carbon monoxide with a carboxyhemoglobin level of 58%, which could have led to symptoms including seizure, unconsciousness or a heart attack. The AAIB considers it likely that the pilot would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide. The AAIB said that it had no plans to raise the wreckage of the plane from the seabed, saying \\"In this case, we consider that it will not add significantly to the investigation and we will identify the correct safety issues through other means.\\" =AAIB final report= The AAIB published its final report into the accident on 13 March 2020. It concluded that the pilot David Ibbotson was not licensed to fly the plane as his rating had expired in November 2018, and that he was not qualified to fly at night. The investigation stated that \\"neither the plane nor the pilot had the required licences or permissions to operate commercially.\\" The report concluded that Sala would have been \\"deeply unconscious\\" due to carbon monoxide poisoning at the time of the crash, but that Ibbotson was still conscious and in control of the plane up to the time of the crash. Legal proceedings On 29 April 2019, two people were arrested after a photograph showing the dead body of Emiliano Sala during a post-mortem was posted on Twitter. On 23 September 2019, a woman and a man working for a security company were jailed for 14 and 5 months for accessing CCTV footage of Sala's post-mortem at the mortuary in Bournemouth, which had led to the leak of the material. On 19 June 2019, Dorset Police announced that they had arrested a man on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act in respect of the death of Sala. His identity was not made public, but several newspapers identified the man as pilot David Henderson, who arranged the flight and had originally intended to fly the plane. On 11 March 2020, it was reported that no further action would be taken against the man.

By extension, the women wearing the coif and the costume associated with it are also called bigoud√®nes. The coif is about 30 cm high, and up to 40 cm in Penmarc'h. The bigoud√®ne coif is worn by the women of the Bigouden Country (Breton: Bro-Vigoudenn; French: Le Pays Bigouden) historically known as \\"Cap Caval\\" and located along the Bay of Audierne (Bro Kernev), south-west of Quimper, Brittany. They have been officially based in the French departement of Finist√®re since 1790. The term bigoud√®ne should not be confused with \\"bigoud√©nnie\\", the geographical concentration of these women, and with the Bigouden region. Ren√© QUILLIVIC in Pors-Poulhan - Plouhinec.alt=left  Etymology  The first attestation of the term bigoud√®ne being used in the French language (from Breton: bigoudenn) was in 1881 in the Revue des deux Mondes (French: [ Å…ôvy de d√∏ m…îÃÉd], Review of the Two Worlds). It had been used in the Breton language around 1830 through the meaning: \\"headdress of linen or cotton worn in the region of Pont-l'Abb√©\\". It is related to the terms bigoudi (stalk around which women wrap their hair), bigot (part of the racage from a yard on top of a traditional square rigged ship) and bigue (kind of pulley, type of spar used as a crane). > \\"Here and there, a man from Pont-l'Abb√© proudly displays his superimposed > jackets, on which brightly colored woolen ribbons stand out as well as > sometimes a holy ciborium embroidered on the back. The women of this same > village whose strange figure is reminiscent of the Lapland type, wear the > hair brought back to the top of their head and kept by a narrow braiding > headdress, are called bigoud√®nes. Their dress has a liveliness of oriental > color: wide yellow or scarlet breastplates, corsages and cuffs supported by > silver, green skirts embellished with dazzling embroidery\\". - (Andr√© > Theuriet, \\"Douarnenez, landscapes and impressions\\", in Revue des Deux > Mondes, volume 43, 1881). = Literary quotes = mass in Plon√©our-Lanvern (1900) by Paul Michels (1866-1944). Bigoud√®nes at the F√™te des Brodeuses (2014). * \\"Very strong, vaulted, thick waist, they [the women from Plomeur] wear three skirts of cloth superimposed (...) and they are wearing the strange bigoud√®ne coif, kind of variegated headband that hides their ears and lets see from behind, their hair up\\". (Fran√ßois Copp√©e, Prose, Mon franc-parler I, 1894, p. 115) *\\"But nothing could stop the stubborn bigoud√®ne\\". - (Herv√© Bazin, , 1956, page 37).  History  Contrary to a widespread legend encapsulating the headdresses‚Äô size as a response to the cut steeples cut during the Revolt of the papier timbr√© (anti-fiscal revolt in the west of Ancien R√©gime France, reign of Louis XIV from April to September 1675); the bigoud√®ne headdress only became really high in the twentieth century, especially in the Interwar period (November 1918 - September 1939) where it gained a centimeter per year. The maximum height of the cap is reached at the end of the Second World War, when the Breton costume started to become old-fashioned. The high headdress is for ceremonies or states of mourning: the everyday headdress worn during the daily work is a simple black velvet ribbon around the comb and behind which one concealed the chignon. In 1977, 31% of women over 47 years old wore the headdress. This figure drastically decreased to only 500 women of all ages) in 1993. In 2011, Maria Lambour is one of the last women to wear this headdress on a daily basis. Today it is worn only during cultural events and by rare women on an almost daily basis. On June 11, 2018, the then doyenne (eldest) of the Bigoud√®nes Marie Pochat died at the age of 102 in her native Brittany. She was one of the few last irreducible Bretons still wearing the headdress. Born on February 29, 1916 in L√©chiagat (now Treffiagat) in the Bigouden country, Marie Pochat regularly wore the headdress since the age of 12 years old. \\"Without this headdress, I feel that I miss something,\\" she told France 3 Brittany on the occasion of the celebration of her centenary in 2016. Only a handful of Bretons still wear this lace headdress, a true symbol of Brittany first appeared in 1747. In 2015, the had hosted an exhibition by photographer showing the considerable richness and diversity of Breton headdresses.  Sartorial aspects  The confection of the bigoud√®nes' traditional costume is recognized as a landmark of French sartorial heritage and high craftsmanship. The oldest known Bigoud√®ne headdress dates back to 1830; still ample, the headdress largely covers the hair; limited to a small rectangle, the embroidery is nascent. It is exhibited at the Bigouden Museum in Pont-l'Abb√©. One of the most important sartorial events for bigoud√®nes is the \\"Feast of Embroiderers\\" (French: F√™te des Brodeuses) taking place every year in July in Pont-l'Abb√©, Finist√®re, Brittany.  In the arts  Numerous artists immortalized the bigoud√®nes such as Henri Guinier (1867- 1927), Fran√ßois Hippolyte Lalaisse (1810-1884), Henri Delavall√©e (1860-1943), Georges A. L. Boisselier (1876-1943), (1825-1893), Georges Lacombe (1868-1916), __(1825-1893), Lucien Simon (1861- 1945), Joseph-F√©lix Bouchor (1853-1937), √âmile Malo-Renault (1870-1938), Paul Gauguin (1848‚Äì1903) and Pascal Dagnan- Bouveret (1852‚Äì1929).  In popular culture  In the French-speaking world, since the 1970s, television commercials from Breizh Cola and most importantly the French food industry company \\"\\" have been portraying elderly women dressed as Bigoud√®nes while shouting \\"Tipiak, Pirates!\\". This famous slogan propelled the term \\"\\" to become synonymous with \\"hacker\\" in web communities and now refers to hackers or counterfeiters. The sticker made by the textile enterprise symbolizing a small figure wearing a bigoud√®ne headdress is stuck on more than 1.5 million cars across the world as of July 2011 and has become a popular symbol of recognition for Bretons.  P√¢tisserie  The Bigoud√®ne brioch√©e (Brioched Bigoud√®ne) is a p√¢tisserie popularized during the ' centenary in Loctudy. It is composed of a raised dough wrapped around a cylinder and cooked on a spit and slowly browned. It is sold on city markets around the bigoud√©nnie and most preponderantly in Locronan regularly elected \\"one of the most beautiful villages in France\\". There are two kinds of those pastry headdresses: a salted one with emmenthal and black olives and the other ones, sweet, covered with sugar or chocolate. The idea was partly inspired by the Eastern countries (Romania, Hungary) where they are very fond of this type of dough put aside to rise for a moment before being put on a grill.

She became the pilot the Blue Lion of Voltron after Sven became no longer able to do so. She has highly intelligent mice that can understand human speech. She is also stalked by Prince Lotor for her affection. Voltron Legendary Defender In Voltron Legendary Defender, Allura is the princess of Altea, the daughter of king Alfor and last surviving female member of the Altean race. She was asleep in the Castle of Lions with her servant Coran for 10,000 years, and commands and pilots the Blue Lion of Voltron. Conception In the Voltron: Legendary Defender, Princess Allura is not initially a member of the Voltron force. But after the \\"disappearance\\" of Shiro, with Keith becoming the Black Paladin and Lance taking Keith's place as Red Paladin, Allura, to complete the Voltron team, is chosen as the Blue Paladin. Design In the classic version of Voltron, Allura was depicted as either Altean or Arusian depending on the region the anime was aired. Also, she was depicted as having fair skin and blonde hair. In Legendary Defender, she was depicted as Altean, and was re-imagined as being dark skinned with white hair (likely so she was distinguishable from her human allies) and, unlike the rest of the main cast, spoke with a British accent. Comics In the 2011 Devil's Due comics, the character Allura is portrayed as a teenager. The comic book version of Allura places her at age 19, and depicts her with a much stronger backbone than her cartoon counterpart. When her home planet Arus was ravaged by the forces of Zarkon and her parents murdered by Zarkon's own hand, she was taken in and raised by Coran, a retired combat instructor in the royal army, and was forced to grow up much too fast. Years later, she would renounce her title of \\"princess,\\" answering only to \\"Allura,\\" until her people are liberated from Zarkon's tyranny. Visions while she slept showed the spirit of her father King Alfor promising that five young men would come to Arus in search of the legendary robot Voltron. When Keith, Lance, Hunk, Pidge, and Sven arrive on Arus and speak of the mighty robot, Allura instantly knows that they are the ones spoken of in her visions, and helps them to find the five hidden lions that will unite to form Voltron. When Voltron fails to combine properly due to a brain defect within Sven, Allura mans his Blue Lion, and with her royal Arusian blood, the unification of Voltron is finally a success, and she becomes a member of the Voltron Force. During the course of the comic, she begins to develop feelings towards Keith and vice versa. Reception The Legendary Defender incarnation of the character was praised to for being diverse.

Various Howardula species and strains infest mushroom-feeding Drosophila, including Howardula aoronymphium and Howardula neocosmis. Howardula husseyi can infest the mushroom phorid Megaselia halterata. Life cycle The life cycle of Howardula nematodes begins inside the host fly, where infective juvenile nematodes are released by either the fly anus or ovipositor onto mushrooms. There, the juvenile nematodes mature and mate. Mated females will then pierce the cuticle of a fly larva using a specialized stylet, and enter the fly hemolymph (insect blood) where the nematode resides. Over the course of the fly host's metamorphosis, the female nematode matures into an adult stage called the motherworm. After the adult fly emerges from its pupa, the motherworm begins releasing juvenile nematodes directly into the hemocoel, renewing the cycle. Other insect- infecting nematodes such as Steinernema and Heterorhabiditis are used as biological control agents, as they efficiently kill their insect prey. However Howardula species require their hosts to survive into adulthood. As such, while Howardula infects insects like other nematode parasites, the \\"goals\\" of these nematodes differs drastically, leading to distinct host-parasite interactions.

Course  The opening of the Hague conference on reparations: one of the two conferences aimed at implementing the Young Plan. Belgium, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy, Second Polish Republic, Portugal, Romania, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Japan were represented at the 2nd session of the Hague Conference on Reparations (August 6-31, 1929). The US officially did not participate in the conference; however, initiating the Young Plan, put pressure on the participants of the conference, seeking to make this plan. At the Hague Conference on Reparations, the struggle between the United Kingdom and France began around three issues: the distribution of so-called unconditional, that is, not proper deferment, part of the reparations; supply in kind (Britain demanded a reduction in their favor in increasing their exports, especially coal); the percentage distribution of the total amount of reparations between the creditors.  Results  As a result of behind-the- scenes negotiations between the main participants of the conference on August 31, 1929, a protocol was signed on the principle approval of the Young plan. The final approval of the Young plan, as well as the adoption of a decision to impose sanctions in the event of Germany's refusal to pay reparations, took place at the 2nd session of the conference (3-20 January 1930), where, in addition to the States parties to the first session, Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary. One of the main decisions of the conference was also the agreement on early retirement (5 years before the date fixed by the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919) of all occupying forces from the Rhineland (no later than 30 June 1930).

The long term objective of this strategy is to establish a system of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in the country. Key points include: # Substantial expansion and strengthening of public sector health care system, freeing the vulnerable population from dependence on high cost and often unreachable private sector health care system. # Health sector expenditure by central government and state government, both plan and non-plan, will have to be substantially increased by the twelfth five-year plan. It was increased from 0.94 per cent of GDP in tenth plan to 1.04 per cent in eleventh plan. The provision of clean drinking water and sanitation as one of the principal factors in control of diseases is well established from the history of industrialized countries and it should have high priority in health related resource allocation. The expenditure on health should increased to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of Twelfth Five Year Plan. # Financial and managerial system will be redesigned to ensure efficient utilization of available resources and achieve better health outcome. Coordinated delivery of services within and across sectors, delegation matched with accountability, fostering a spirit of innovation are some of the measures proposed. # Increasing the cooperation between private and public sector health care providers to achieve health goals. This will include contracting in of services for gap filling, and various forms of effectively regulated and managed Public-Private Partnership, while also ensuring that there is no compromise in terms of standards of delivery and that the incentive structure does not undermine health care objectives. # The present Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) which provides cash less in-patient treatment through an insurance based system should be reformed to enable access to a continuum of comprehensive primary, secondary and tertiary care. In twelfth plan period entire Below Poverty Line (BPL) population will be covered through RSBY scheme. In planning health care structure for the future, it is desirable to move from a 'fee-for- service' mechanism, to address the issue of fragmentation of services that works to the detriment of preventive and primary care and also to reduce the scope of fraud and induced demand. # In order to increase the availability of skilled human resources, a large expansion of medical schools, nursing colleges, and so on, is therefore is necessary and public sector medical schools must play a major role in the process. Special effort will be made to expand medical education in states which are under-served. In addition, a massive effort will be made to recruit and train paramedical and community level health workers. # The multiplicity of Central sector or Centrally Sponsored Schemes has constrained the flexibility of states to make need based plans or deploy their resources in the most efficient manner. The way forward is to focus on strengthening the pillars of the health system, so that it can prevent, detect and manage each of the unique challenges that different parts of the country face. # A series of prescription drugs reforms, promotion of essential, generic medicine and making these universally available free of cost to all patients in public facilities as a part of the Essential Health Package will be a priority. # Effective regulation in medical practice, public health, food and drugs is essential to safeguard people against risks and unethical practices. This is especially so given the information gaps in the health sector which make it difficult for individual to make reasoned choices. # The health system in the Twelfth Plan will continue to have a mix of public and private service providers. The public sector health services need to be strengthened to deliver both public health related and clinical services. The public and private sectors also need to coordinate for the delivery of a continuum of care. A strong regulatory system would supervise the quality of services delivered. Standard treatment guidelines should form the basis of clinical care across public and private sectors, with the adequate monitoring by the regulatory bodies to improve the quality and control the cost of care,  Criticism  Students educating people about mosquito-borne diseases. The High Level Expert Group report recommends an increase in public expenditure on health from 1.58 per cent of GDP currently to 2.1 per cent of GDP by the end of the 12th five-year plan. However, even this is far lower than the global median of 5 per cent.http://www.thehindu.com/business/where-the-outlook-is- healthy/article3589038.ece Retrieved from The Hindu on 27 July 2013 The lack of extensive and adequately funded public health services pushes large numbers of people to incur heavy out of pocket expenditures on services purchased from the private sector. Out of pocket expenditures arise even in public sector hospitals, since lack of medicines means that patients have to buy them. This results in a very high financial burden on families in case of severe illness. Retrieved from Planning commission site on 27 July 2013 Though, the 12th plan document express concern over high out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure, it does not give any target or time frame for reducing this expense . OOP can be reduced only by increasing public expenditure on health and by setting up widespread public health service providers. But the planning commission is planning to do this by regulating private health care providers. It takes solace from the HLEG report which admits that, \\"the transformation of India‚Äôs health system to become an effective platform for UHC is an evolutionary process that will span several years\\".http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/UHC_ExecSummary.pdf Retrieved from Planning Commission website on 27 July 2013. Instead of developing a better public health system with enhanced health budget, 12th five-year plan document plans to hand over health care system to private institutions. The 12th plan document causes concern over Rashtriya Swasthya Bhima Yojana being used as a medium to hand over public funds to the private sector through an insurance route. This has also incentivised unnecessary treatment which in due course will increase costs and premiums. There have been complaints about high transaction cost for this scheme due to insurance intermediaries. RSBY does not take into consideration state specific variation in disease profiles and health needs. Even though these things are acknowledged in the report, no alternative remedy is given. There is no reference to nutrition as key component of health and for universal Public Distribution System (PDS) in the plan document or HLEG recommendation. In the section of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in the document, the commitment to provide 30- to 50-bed Community Health Centres (CHC) per 100 000 population is missing from the main text. It was easy for the government to recruit poor women as ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers but it has failed to bring doctors, nurses and specialist in this area. The ASHA workers who are coming from a poor background are given incentive based on performance. These people lose many days job undertaking their task as ASHA worker which is not incentivised properly. Even the 12th plan doesn't give any solace. To summarize, successive administrative and political reforms have conveniently bypassed training citizens and local bodies to actively participate in healthcare. In a situation where people are not enabled to identify poor quality, speak up and debate. There is dire need for the health system to fill that role on behalf of the people and can be easily done by decentralization of healthcare governance. A recent study pointed out that access to advanced medical facilities under a single roof was the main reason for the choice of private hospitals in both rural and urban areas. The second major reason for private healthcare preference was proximity of the facility in the rural area and approachability and friendly conduct of doctors and staff in the urban centers.

The character's first appearance was in Voltron.  Voltron: Defender of the Universe  Pidge is the young genius of the Voltron Lion Force force and pilot of the Green Lion. He is the brother of the Vehicle Force team member Chip, though the circumstances of this relationship differ by continuity. Pidge and Chip are twin brothers and were orphaned at a young age. When his foster parents wanted to adopt Pidge, he refused to go unless they took Chip as well. He and Chip had grown up on Balto, and yet he described himself as an Earth man, implying he was at least of Earth descent (if not born on Earth). He was part of a scout team, led by Shiro, sent to Planet Arus by the Galaxy Alliance. He and the rest of the team were captured by the forces of Planet Doom, and they later escaped. Crash landing on Arus after their escape, they made their way to the Castle of Lions. There, they met Princess Allura and Coran, and were commissioned as the Voltron Force. Pidge would fly Green Lion. He would develop a friendship with the Space Mice, even helping them to train to be a fighting force. A mission would later take an emotional toll on him. Responding to a distress call from planet Balto, He and the Voltron Force arrived and found out that the planet on which he and Chip grew up would explode. Balto exploded after narrowly escaping a trap set up by Prince Lotor.  Voltron Force  Pidge is a technological whiz and the Voltron Force member who pilots the Green Lion. Pidge is a member of Galaxy Garrison. He is ranked as a Tech Sergeant.  Voltron: Legendary Defender  In Voltron: Legendary Defender, Pidge is a teenage girl of Italian descent named Katie Holt. Katie \\"Pidge\\" Holt is a former communications cadet at the Galaxy Garrison, and current pilot of the Green Lion of Voltron. She is a strategic fighter, and a highly intelligent, versatile hacker and inventor who disguised herself as a boy named \\"Pidge Gunderson\\" to search for the truth about her missing family. She's fiercely loyal to her friends and an independent thinker. Pidge is a shorter-than-average human girl masquerading as a boy, and her appearance reflects her androgynous personal style. She is the slimmest and shortest of the Paladins. She has brown eyes, fair skin, and disheveled light brown hair. She makes no obvious effort to cut or style her hair, so it tends to form two spikes on either side of her head and unruly bangs. She dons wire-framed, round, circular glasses with fake lenses to address her lack of actual visual impairment. Comics In the 2011 Devil's Due comics, the Pidge character is referred to as Darrell \\"Pidge\\" Stoker. The comic book version of Pidge depicts him as a growth-stunted 15-year-old, and as an Earthling (as opposed to his cartoon counterpart hailing from the planet Balto). He's also depicted as an orphan abandoned outside a convent when she was six weeks old (however, he may yet have a family because later he talks with Vehicle team member Chip about the similarities that exist between the two of them, he remarks that '[they]'re one DNA test short of discovering [they]'re brothers' which is a nod to the cartoon establishment of Pidge and Chip as twins). During his years at the orphanage, his scores on a state- mandated IQ test caught the eye of the New West Point military academy, who promptly enrolled him to put his awe-inspiring understanding of computer systems to good use. However, his life at NWP turned out to be worse than at the orphanage, and was the subject of regular beatings by his intellectually- threatened peers, until he was approached by Colonel Hawkins to join a team of outcasts to search for the legendary robot Voltron on the distant planet Arus. Pidge didn't have to be asked twice, and promptly agreed. Reception The Voltron Legendary Defender version of the character has been praised as inclusive and displaying a non-conforming gender.

Conception One the differences to Prince Lotor in Voltron: Legendary Defender compared to his 1984 counterpart is that he didn't have an obsessive love towards Princess Allura. His affection for her is treated as genuine, which is confirmed by series staff writers. According to the Voltron writer Lauren Montgomery, the reason why Lotor became evil was his tragic upbringing where he was abandoned by his parents (his mother not knowing he was her son), Lotor had to survive on his own, even if it means tricking others to get what he wanted. Montgomery further stated that had Lotor raised by in a better background, Lotor would likely have grown into a much better person. Prince Lotor's life is multiplied by Quintessence, allowing him to live for 10,000 years, due to being already conceived by the time his mother, Honerva, entered the rift on Daibazaal.

Plot  The movie starts with a man (Luke Evans) watching a woman with red hair, Cathy (Kelly Reilly) take a seat in a restaurant to eat lunch. He gets up and casually walks by her to wait outside at the car park for her. She exits soon after and goes to her yoga lessons. He parks his car next to her car. When she comes out he grabs her from behind to gag her, in broad daylight. She screams for help just before he puts tape over her mouth and ties her hands on her back. There is a man close by but he doesn't hear her since he has headphones on with blaring music. He changes cars and puts her in the trunk to drive to his house outside of the city. You see him drop off Cathy in a small (10 by 10) room, which appears to be a cellar. He leaves her in there to talk to her the following day. She seems rather helpless but as the plot develops you see that she is quite feisty. The house is outside the city, no houses close by. And the cellar is soundproof and behind a shielded wall. No way to escape unless he lets her go. Once she gets her hands in front of her body by doing some gymnastics moves she attacks him when he wants to get her for lunch. She tries to call the police on the land line but he shoots the phone and so she desperately tries to get free. When they sit down to eat he asks her again for her name and she answers him. He freaks out and launches at her. She tries to strangle him from behind but he knocks her out and takes her back to the cellar. As he exits the cellar his maid, Alondra, enters the house to be astonished at a disheveled and bleeding Lewis. He forgot to tell her to take a day off. She leaves again. He cleans up the mess and as he puts the stems of pussy willow in a new vase you get the feeling he is lost somehow. Earlier on he had also told her that if he wanted to kill her he would already have done that, but he obviously is after something else. Cathy lies in the cellar, bleeding and in pain. He goes back in there and questions her for her name again. She tells him she already answered him. He doesn't seem to believe her. He keeps on asking her for her past life. He admits to her that he has been watching her and that she is a liar. Lewis asks again where she was born and this time she changes her story. He seems to know more about her. She said she studied English and owns a flower shop. But then she admits having studied medicine. As seen before he follows a public trial where several people have died. He somehow seems to be connected to those cases. Cathy is not Cathy, but rather Nathalie - Cathy, her twin sister, killed herself after their father, who had been the doctor for a football team, cheated on their mother with a cheerleader. Lewis watches a movie where he cradles a baby. In the meantime Cathy calls the police, when she gets a little reception, with her well hidden mobile phone. He rushes in to ask her about the Charleston deaths and we find out that the third victim was his wife Alana Matthews Lewis. He accuses her of murder since his wife's blood was full of the rape drug GHB. She first apologizes for Alana's death. And he simply states that he knows that she killed his wife. He continues to watch films of his little happy family, his wife Alana and his daughter Summer. He continues watching films of his little happy family and seems to loose his grip more. He returns to the cellar to threaten her with his gun. She starts to ramble on about her past life, as a child. How, after their father had left, they were treated like outcasts and that her sister couldn't take it anymore. Nathalie tells him that she killed these people out of vengeance for what her father had done. And so he finds out that his wife had cheated on him, but he doesn't want to believe her. She admits to killing these people officially. Because they were sinners and in church they preach one shouldn't commit sins. He looks for evidence for his wife's cheating on videos and sees one part in particular where her phone rings, she looks at it impassively and ends the call. He flips out and drives away with his car. In the meantime Nathalie tries to remove a broken shard of floor tile to cut open her restraints. He, in the meantime, stops at a lake. Suddenly the police show up and want to take a look at his car since an incident has been reported with a car involved which seems similar to his. Police officer one remarks how clean his car is and asks about the shoes in the trunk (his wife's) and the second officer says he is clean. After that they apologize for the inconvenience and leave. He returns to his house telling her she had no right to kill his wife before he could talk to her. That she needs to go to the police and confess. She tries to stab him with the shard of floor tile and flees from the cellar. She tells him beforehand that she is now Cathy and won't let him ruin her now happy life. He bleeds strongly and tries to lock her into the cellar again but she gets out and then it gets more complicated when Alondra, his house maid, comes home with his daughter. She shoots Alandra and takes Summer as hostage. She tells him this can only end with his and his daughter's death, who doesn't seem to be his biological daughter after all since his wife cheated on him. Summer bites Cathy/Nathalie and runs away and hides in the cellar where Lewis finds his daughter. He wants to run away with his daughter who remarks that Cathy is gone. He takes the recordings from the computer of the confessions of Cathy and runs to the garage where he gets cornered by her. He fights with her and she tries to stab him with a pitchfork but he drives it upwards to take her off balance and knocks her unconscious. Beforehand she knocks off the stop for the garage door and gets caught under it. Soon after the police arrive and the nightmare is over. He hugs Summer and tells her that she is HIS baby girl, his daughter.

His case is considered notable because it led to numerous arrests of other criminals and discovery of domestic violence offences. He was executed by firing squad on August 28, 1980. Biography =Early life= Hristo Georgiev was born in Sofia as one of three children in 1956. His father Bogdan was a tailor, while his mother Tsvetanka, who had heart problems, was a knitter. He had two brothers‚ÄîBogomil, a former boxer who was known to the MBP as an aggressive fellow, and Evgeni, who had mental anomalies. At the beginning of the 70s, he was hired to work for the National militia (police), but his alcoholism and careless behavior prevented him from doing the job adequately. On November 9, 1978, he began work for the 2nd Road Patrol Sector, but since the beginning of 1979 he began to miss work frequently and was eventually fired on July 10 of that same year. =Murder of Zahari Hristov= The murders start with the discovery of a body in 1974, between the \\"G. Kostov\\" and \\"P. Mihailov\\" Streets in Sofia. Early riser citizens had discovered the appalling crime scene, which depicted the murder victim having his ribs broken, his guts disemboweled and his face mutilated, resulting from harsh violence inflicted on him. The victim was later identified as 35-year-old Zahari Hristov, nicknamed \\"The Oven Man\\", an alcoholic with a dysfunctional family life who lived in the same district. Authorities speculated that the murder was committed between August 23 and 24, between 10pm and 1am. The discovery of the body prompted lead investigator Sen. Lt. G. Dilkov to work on four hypotheses: the first being an act of hooliganism on the grounds of alcohol intoxication (with the aim of either robbery or sexual assault); the second the work of a psychopath; the third an unpaid debt between friends; and the fourth a family feud, as Hristov had a bad relationship with them, as well as there being a dispute over property. Investigator H. Mishev examined the crime scene at around 9:10 in the morning, noting that the man was found lying on his back with his pants lowered and his shirt ripped. There was a packet of \\"Stewardess\\" brand cigarettes, eight tickets worth four stotinki each, two 1-leva notes, a lottery ticket and a ticket from Toto 2. His alcohol level was measured at 2.83. Without delay, the investigators started questioning acquaintances, beginning with a man named Pavel, who had last given Zahari a ride. An agent, codenamed \\"Ana\\", was sent to investigate his wife, while acquaintances of the man named Saro, Gorcho, Sineto and others were being questioned. The authorities examined the local pubs, questioned couples who were seen in the area, made lists of all the homosexuals in the area and checked all the aggressive mentally ill people who frequented the district. Zahari Hristov Voinov had come to Sofia in 1948, initially working as a baker. He then began frequently changing jobs, amassing debts in the range of 1800 leva (a huge sum at the time) which his wife had to pay off. In a span of two years, he had visited the local alcoholism treatment facility a total of 22 times. His family were no strangers to violence, as in 1972, his elder daughter had hit him on the head with a hammer. An interesting witness testimony was that of an N. Stankov, who had seen his neighbour drunk in the company of several young men, one of whom was clearly faking his drunkenness. He described the man as around 1.80 m. tall, skinny, with blond hair and looking like a \\"butt boy\\" who walked like a brute. However, due to unclear reasons, this lead was abandoned. =Questioning suspects= Eventually, investigators reach a dead end, but not without questioning a few suspects first. The prime target was a man named Tsvetomir Enev, who had come to Sofia on August 22, 1974 to submit an application to join the \\"Kremikovtsi\\" MK, but he failed to meet the police chief, and then began strolling around the capital. During the night, he had come across a drunk lying on the ground and tried to help him, but the drunkard thought he was being robbed, so he began screaming loudly, attracting a nearby militia patrol. They brought in Enev for questioning, suspecting that he was responsible for several attacks on drunkards around the city. After his release, he had decided to take a nap at \\"Freedom Park\\", where he would later wake up to realise his shoes had been stolen. The next day, after sightseeing around Sofia, he decided to rest in the park again, only to become a witness to talk between two teenagers, who bragged about beating up a man. It later turned out that one of the teens had ripped his shoes during the scuffle, so he had stolen Enev's. The man then proceeded to ask them to return his shoes, after which he was quickly threatened with a knife and robbed. The bad luck hadn't ended with Enev, as he had then come across the gang of \\"The Crazy from Pernik\\", who were surprisingly benevolent enough to leave six of his nine leva, so he could buy a bus ticket and ride home. After no sufficient evidence was found against him, Enev was discredited as a suspect. The next suspects were two brothers from Orlandovtsi, known as the \\"Gravemen\\". They were local bullies, who had even beaten up a witness testifying against them. An agent, codenamed \\"Plamen\\", was sent to investigate them, but they had a credible alibi. In the end, \\"Operation Rodopi\\" was initiated concerning Hristov's family, in which an agent codenamed \\"Albert\\" became close with his wife, Veska. In 1976, the agent gave information to the intelligence, which then planted spying devices. Zahari's son-in-law was pressured, with probes from his hair and skin and fingerprints taken, and his house had to be examined. The authorities even used a trick concerning a fake \\"anonymous witness\\" who sent a letter to the family, claiming that he knew everything and would tell the militia. This scared the daughter Emilia and her mother, but only because they were afraid the police would blame them for the murder. In the end, they were cleared of any suspicion, and the killer remained free. The operation wasn't completely fruitless however, as it led to the investigation of 17 persons with criminal backgrounds, 25 mentally ill, eight relatives of Hristov and nine suspects. Eventually, 13 instances of domestic violence and two acts of hooliganism were discovered. =Murder of Tsvetanka Stancheva= On October 10, 1979, on \\"General Liprandi\\" Street in Sofia's \\"Hadzhi Dimitar\\" District, the body of 19-year-old Tsvetanka Stancheva was found. She had been stabbed with a sharp object. A man, who was collecting bricks from a nearby abandoned building, had discovered the grisly scene. The victim was infected with syphilis, which led the investigators to interrogate all the registered people suffering from the same disease, who had not revealed the source of how they got it. Taking into account Tsvetanka's life, the theory of one of her suitors having killed her was considered, as well as that of a psychopath. The case was then nicknamed \\"The Provincialist\\". Following this murder, mass examinations centred on and around the treatment centres, with employees of hotels known for housing prostitutes also being questioned. The next step in the investigation was to interrogate all the adults and foreigners Stancheva had offered her services to. She was described as being 1.60 m. tall, with a slight figure, chestnut brown hair which reached to her shoulders and bright brown eyes. She had worn a red wool blouse and Levi brand jeans. Her body had been hidden under a bunch of rags, but a fingerprint and a male ring were found on the scene. Most of the wounds had been inflicted on the victim's back, indicating that she had put up a struggle and had managed to run for some distance before being caught. Stancheva was born ca 1960 in Mirkovo to farmer parents. She had an older brother. She hadn't finished high school, as she had fled with an older man to the village of Glavinitsa, Pazardzhik Municipality, where she was systematically beaten. Stancheva continued her education in Koprivshtitsa, but was expelled for bad behaviour, before beginning work at a tavern in Mirkovo. There she met Vasil Deyanov, who brought her to Sofia, but they soon separated and she was left without a legal job. She then began to develop intimate relationships with friends she stayed with, also frequently visiting modern for the time clubs such as \\"Yalta\\", \\"Spring\\", \\"White Lamb\\", \\"Preslav\\", \\"Prague\\" and \\"Park Hotel Moscow\\". Subsequently, investigators took the fingerprints from the witnesses who discovered the body, while also trying to connect the murder to the killing of an artist named Lyubo from bar \\"Orient\\". Agent \\"Anton\\" was sent to investigate a group of prostitutes, while agent \\"Orlin\\" investigated homosexual circles with the aim of learning who her regular clients were and her contacts with her fellow \\"colleagues\\". Thanks to these actions, four infamous suitors were arrested‚Äî\\"Boretsa\\", \\"Kuriletsa\\", \\"Bati\\" and A. Uzunov. However, the witnesses weren't questioned thoroughly and no other hypotheses were considered. To activate the work, lists were created detailing every suspect, which eventually led to a prostitute named \\"Ceca the Arabian\\", who was known for serving clients from the Middle East and Northern Africa. She claimed that she had last seen Stancheva with a member of the orchestra from bar \\"Orient\\". Eventually, her case was connected to another murder that occurred 17 days later‚Äîthat of Mariolka Gospodinova. This led to the creation of the \\"Sadist\\" case, combining the previous murders and leading to the interrogation of around 600 mentally ill people. As it was later revealed, Tsvetanka often engaged in group sex with shady characters from the underground world. The militiamen also learned that she had been caught in an unpleasant situation with three men sentenced for rape in Dianabad, as well as being involved with other criminals, such as \\"Uncle Slavi the Barber\\" (an infamous suitor), \\"Bubi\\", \\"Katia the Limpy\\", \\"Naso the Weasel\\" and others. Additional trouble also caused fake leads. One such person, a man nicknamed \\"Pesho\\", told a former female classmate and her colleague working in a library, that his friend, called Pencho, often took girls who hitchhiked and forced them to have sex with him. A short time before the murder, the two men had taken a shared acquaintance and had sex with her, after which they had to take antibiotics. Affected from this situation and hearing about the murder, Pesho told the two women how Pencho had beaten up \\"some slut with syphilis\\", who infected him. The women then informed the police, who later realised that the hooligans had stable alibis. In the end, 154 people were established as having connections to her, 23 of whom were her intimate partners (four of them with syphilis), as well as 800 mentally ill being questioned and 45 witness testimonies being investigated by agents. Yet, it was to no avail. =Murder of Mariolka Gospodinova= Gospodinova (n√©e Naidenova) was murdered 17 days after Stancheva. She was found next to a metal shack on October 23, 1979 on \\"Kozloduy\\" Street No. 4, with a total of 36 stab wounds to her body. Next to the body, traces of a knife, coins, medicine, a woman's coat, a small mirror, purse, two packs of cigarettes, condoms, a PFC Levski Sofia badge and a passport were found. A small knife was found in one of her pockets. The body was found seated on top of some old cables. She was undressed down to her waist, with her bra and blouse behind her. Mariolka had divorced twice, having two children from her first husband. She had made an \\"agreement\\" with her second husband to go out twice a month with other men, as her husband was terminally ill. She had basic education, and first married in 1962, but her constant cheating led to her divorce several years later. Due to this, she had managed to give her husband gonorrhea and make him question if he was the father of their second daughter. In 1972, Gospodinova married again, only to divorce two years later. She married for the final time in 1979, lasting only a few months, due to constantly breaking of her \\"agreement\\" with the husband. Despite this, she continued to live with him. Authorities investigated the three husbands, but all had credible alibis: the first was visiting relatives with many witnesses, the second had visited friends and remained there for the night and the third was too ill, dying a little while before the murder. Another person of interest was a young man with psychological defects, who yearned for rivers of blood and was susceptible to self-harm. It later turned out that Mariolka and Tsvetanka actually knew each other, which made the authorities consider the cases to be connected. In the meantime, a woman tried to implicate her husband Tsonyo in the murder after he brought a bloodied suit to the dry cleaner's, but it was later revealed to have resulted from intervening in a fight between hooligans. Approximately 10 lovers of Gospodinova were established for the last three years, but all eventually were cleared of suspicion. Temporarily, an already proven killer named Stefan Hristov (no relation to Zahari Hristov) was considered. On December 30, 1979, suspecting that his girlfriend was cheating with his best friend Georgi Georgiev, Hristov tortured the woman into falsely confessing to the affair, after which the enraged man stalked and then butchered his friend. However, no link could be established. =Murder of Angela Pantova= Between March 3 and 4, 1980, Pantova was killed on Kurilo Station, close to a nearby pavilion, after which her body was put into an empty train car. Before that, she had been to \\"Park Hotel Moscow\\", after which at 23:10 she boarded Tram 14 to Sofia Central Station and got on the train \\"Sofia-Lakatnik\\", leaving the stop accompanied by two young men. Unlike the other victims, she had only received one stab to the back with a knife, after which she ran about 30 meters, before being strangled and most likely raped. After this murder, authorities realised that the victims were killed in places either near or connected to Tram 14. Due to the struggle from the victim, examined DNA traces revealed the perpetrator's blood type - AB. =Murder of Lilia Hristova= The young woman disappeared on March 24, 1980, after which she was reported missing by her parents. Authorities began checking hospital wards, questioning friends, relatives and her current boyfriend K. Zahariev. It was determined that until 10pm she had been at her home in \\"Emil Markov\\" District, after which she had left to see her boyfriend. To her relatives' horror, on April 15, 1980, 21-year-old Lilia's body was found at the \\"Hristo Smirnenski\\" Park. Her clothes were removed, but not ripped through, with no signs of alcohol, and her purse was missing. Logically, the first to be interrogated was Zahariev, who claimed that they'd known each other for several years, and that after a sleepover at mutual friends they began dating. One night, after visiting Hristova's home, he criticised her brother on how dirty the residence was, and the two men began fighting. After this, the pair separated temporarily before reuniting shortly before the murder. The night before the disappearance, the pair spent in Zahariev's house, watching the theatrical show \\"Geshefti\\", before he sent her off to the Bus No. 74 bus stop. During the investigation, it was discovered that Lilia had relationships with several men, was a victim of domestic abuse and was diagnosed with neurosis. The suspect circle all had credible alibis, including Zahariev, whose parents testified that they were at his house with him shortly after he sent off the girl. Despite several attempts at renewal, the case was eventually closed. Arrest, sentence and death On March 20, 1980, four days before the disappearance, a young girl was threatened with a knife at an elevator in the nearby Nadhezhda district, with the knife being similar to that used in the previous murders. Thirty minutes later, on \\"Yakov Latinov\\" Street, another girl was successfully robbed of two leva. The two witnesses gave the same description of the attacker‚Äîa young man, around 1.70 (5,5 feet) tall, well-kempt and unable to pronounce the letter \\"R\\". On April 18, 1980, Georgiev was finally captured after attempting to steal a golden chain from a woman, but a nearby policeman managed to catch him. He was taken to the nearby precinct, where he was forced to give his fingerprints, which matched the one found on the scene of Tsvetanka Stancheva's murder. The man then confessed to his crimes, although since the case was transferred directly to the court, it is unknown what the exact confession is. Hristo Bogdanov Georgiev was eventually sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad on August 28, 1980.

Biography  Sadako was born as the second daughter of Shozo Tsutakawa in Seattle in 1907. Her younger brother was George Tsutakawa. Although she spent her childhood in Seattle, she went to Japan for formal education. On October 20, 1932, Sadako married Fujimatsu Moriguchi in Tacoma, Washington. According to family tradition, Sadako's father arranged a marriage with Fujimatsu. Sadako helped open the first Uwajimaya store in Tacoma. During World War II, the Moriguchis were interned at Pinedale, California, where Sadako gave birth to a daughter, and then at Tule Lake, where she gave birth to two children. After the war, the family moved to Seattle's Japantown, where they set up Uwajimaya again at a small building on South Main Street. In 1962, Uwajimaya made exhibitions at the Century 21 Exposition by opening a gift shop. After Fujimatsu died that same year in August, he left his business to his sons. The brothers eventually shared their ownership with their sisters and their mother, who continued working at Uwajimaya with her children until the age of 85. However, for the next 40 years after her husband's death, Moriguchi still attended to the customers of Uwajimaya, mostly in the company's gift operations, even though she did not serve in an official position. She was selected as one of eleven Northwest women of Japanese ancestry to feature in the exhibition \\"Strength and Diversity: Japanese American Women 1885-1990\\" at the Burke Museum. Moriguchi spent her last days at Seattle's Keiro Nursing Home. She died from complications of Alzheimer's disease on July 25, 2002.'Founder of Seattle Landmark Grocery Dies at 94', Lewiston Morning Tribune.'Sadako Tsutakawa Moriguchi', Baltimore Sun (30 July 2002).

Reports of the crimes terrified area residents for several days until a police manhunt identified and apprehended a suspect, Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, an illegal immigrant. The sheriff's report states that Martinez-Guzman later confessed. He is an illegal immigrant, however his immigration status was not taken into consideration for the accusations levied and penalty sought. Killings A region-wide manhunt began after Connie Koontz was found dead in her Gardnerville home on January 10, 2019. Sophia Renken was found shot to death in her home in Gardnerville on January 13. Gerald and Sharon David were found dead in their home in Reno on January 16. Connie Koontz had jewelry stolen during the incident. She was 56. Sophia Renken (74) was found dead inside her home, about one mile from Koontz's house, on January 13. 81-year-old Gerald David and 80-year-old Sharon David were found dead in their south Reno home on January 16, 2019. The manhunt continued for nine days. Information obtained through tracking an Apple watch which had been stolen from Koontz led to a woman who had attempted to connect a digital account to the watch; her son Wilber Ernesto Martinez- Guzman is now under arrest and accused of committing the series of murders. She was living in Carson City with Martinez-Guzman. Douglas County, Washoe County and Carson City sheriffs' offices and the Federal Bureau of Investigations started surveillance of Martinez-Guzman and his mother. The following day, jewelry belonging to Koontz and a ring belonging to Jerry David were found at a Carson City pawn shop. Suspect Authorities had Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman under surveillance as they investigated the string of murder-robberies, and took him into custody as he approached a suburban gun store, fearing that he intended to purchase weapons. He was arrested in Carson City, Nevada on January 19, 2019 on suspicion of having committed the murders. The initial charges were for possession of stolen property, two counts of burglary, and obtaining money under false pretenses. Martinez-Guzman, then 19 years old, is thought to have been living in Carson City for about a year. He is a citizen of El Salvador.  Legal proceedings  Following the killings, Martinez-Guzman was detained on an immigration hold. According to immigration officials, Martinez-Guzman \\"was likely in the United States illegally and was detainable.\\" according to a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs released from jail, law enforcement will contact us, and we will pick him up and we will start the proceedings for his deportation.‚Äù Martinez-Guzman is expected to be tried in each of the two counties where the killings took place, Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks and Douglas County District Attorney Mark Jackson each plan to lead the prosecution team in their respective counties. Martinez-Guzman appeared in court on January 23, 2019, where he was charged with possession of stolen property, burglary, and obtaining money under false pretenses. In February 2019, Martinez-Guzman waived his right to a preliminary hearing and a judge approved his transfer to Washoe County where he is held without bail to face prosecution for four murders. Prosecution in Carson City for 26 burglary and possession charges was placed on hold. The suspect's trial was scheduled for April 2020, and was later delayed to August 31, 2020.

Overview The XF9 is a product of an ATLA project Research on fighter engine system (2015‚Äì2019) which followed two preliminary projects, Research on main components of next generation engines (2010‚Äì2015) and Research on fighter engine elements (2013‚Äì2017). Started after development of the XF5 turbofan engine (1995‚Äì2008), these research projects are preliminary works for Japan's future fighter program or the successor to the Mitsubishi F-2 fighter. The basic concept is to produce a \\"slim and high- power\\" engine, thereby creating more capacity for accommodating fuel and weaponry inside the fuselage of stealth fighter to reduce radar cross section. The concept, dubbed High-power Slim Engine, also appears in an MoD report titled A vision for research and development of future fighter aircraft (2010) as the powerplant for a conceptual Japanese future fighter, the i3 FIGHTER. While its predecessor, the XF5, was a small engine, the XF9-1 prototype is close to the General Electric F110 in size, and is comparable to the Pratt & Whitney F119 in terms of thrust class. With the core that withstands 2,073 K (1,800‚ÑÉ) class Turbine Inlet Temperature, the XF9-1 produces a high thrust, improving fuel economy at the same time. As of 2018, the officially publicized thrust level of the prototype is \\"11 tons (107 kN / 24,000 lbf) or more\\" in military thrust and \\"15 tons (147 kN / 33,000 lbf) or more\\" with afterburner. The XF9 is designed to be adaptable to a wide range of thrust level, higher or lower, depending on requirement; and the future fighter engine program is conducted with a target maximum thrust of 20 tons (196 kN / 44,000 lbf) in mind, which was unveiled at the ATLA Technology Symposium 2018. Technical features XF9-1 on a test run The XF9-1 is a twin-spool axial-flow afterburning turbofan with a dual redundant FADEC, consisting of a 3-stage fan, a 6-stage high-pressure compressor, an annular type combustor, a single- stage high-pressure turbine, a single-stage low-pressure turbine, an afterburner, and a convergent-divergent nozzle. The concept, slim and high- power, resulted in an approximately 30% higher thrust per unit cross-sectional area compared to the GE F110 the Mitsubishi F-2 is equipped with. To achieve this thrust level, a higher combustion temperature (1,800‚ÑÉ class) and an optimized aerodynamic design were needed, which in turn required advanced material, manufacturing, cooling and fluid analysis technologies. Each of the rotors is a blisk to contribute to weight reduction and downsizing. The combustor is equipped with patented new-type burners, Wide-angle Swirler, to facilitate stable combustion and more uniform heat distribution at the outlet. To reduce cost, the high-pressure turbine disk is manufactured by forging technique instead of powder metallurgy (PM) employed in the XF5; the material is a nickel-cobalt base superalloy, TMW-24, developed by NIMS, of which heat resistance is comparable to that of PM superalloys. Turbine blades made of a Japanese fifth generation nickel base single-crystal superalloy are friction welded to the disk to form the blisk, which is enclosed in the shroud made of ceramic matrix composites. The afterburner is a new type to eliminate the conventional annular flame holders to improve efficiency. As another characteristic, the XF9-1 incorporates a starter generator that outputs 180 kW, meaning that a twin-engine fighter with this engine can be supplied with as much as 360 kW of electricity by engines alone. The capacity is quite large compared to that of conventional fourth or fifth generation fighters such as the Boeing F-15E (76 kW), the Lockheed Martin F-22 (130 kW), and the Lockheed Martin F-35 (160 kW), allowing for next generation avionics and other high power consuming onboard devices and equipment. In addition, a research to demonstrate thrust vectoring control and its failure handling technology is conducted from 2016 to 2020 in parallel with development of the engine. This research is aimed at achieving higher maneuverability and smaller control surfaces favorable to stealth aircraft. For the XF9-1, the XVN3-1 three- dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle is available, which can deflect thrust up to 20 degrees in all circumference directions.

The station at Main and Mercer Streets opened in 1872; it was replaced with one at River Street in 1950. Public Service trolley lines served both stations. History 1905 map showing rail and trolley lines and stations in Hackensack The Hoboken, Ridgefield and Paterson Railroad was chartered in 1866 to connect Paterson with the ports along the North River (Hudson River). The New Jersey Midland Railway (NJM) was formed in 1870 as a consolidation of several smaller railroads. By March 1872, the line had been extended west through Maywood Paterson, Wortendyke, and Butler to Newfoundland. It was later extended to Sparta, Newton, Blairstown and across the Delaware River to Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Soon thereafter, trains running east and south to the Hudson Waterfront via Marion Junction and the Bergen Hill Cut to Pennsylvania Railroad's depot in Jersey City, where transfer was possible to the Jersey City Ferry. The NJ Midland was absorbed into the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad. In 1898, the NYSW became a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad, and made use of Erie's Pavonia Terminal and the Pavonia Ferry or to Susquehanna Transfer, which provided transfer to buses through the Lincoln Tunnel to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The station at Main Street was replaced with one at River Street on June 29, 1950. Both were also stops on the Public Service trolley line. There was also a NYSW station in the city at Prospect Avenue. Passenger service on the line was eliminated June 30, 1966; it is now used for exclusively for freight. Rail service running north‚Äìsouth in Hackensack began in 1865 and was operated by the Hackensack and New York Railroad, which was later reorganized as the New Jersey and New York Railroad and in 1896 leased by the Erie Railroad, though there was no interchange with the NYS&W.; The right of way is now New Jersey Transit Rail Operations's Pascack Valley Line, with stations at Essex Street and Anderson Street. Future Building at Main and Mercer streets in Hackensack along the NYS&W; right-of-way, 2015 The Passaic-Bergen Rail Line is a project by New Jersey Transit (NJT) to reintroduce passenger service on a portion of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway right-of-way in Passaic and Bergen counties.

His regiment did not see any combat, remaining in Tampa, Florida, and later Huntsville, Alabama, for the majority of the war. Gibbs was mustered out of the military on October 8, 1898. In 1901, Gibbs began attending Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He graduated with his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1903. Gibbs was admitted to the Florida Bar the same year, and he joined the law firm A. W. Cockrell & Son as a law assistant.  Political career  In 1912, Gibbs was elected to the municipal court of Duval County. He served until 1913, when Governor Park Trammell appointed him to the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. Gibbs served on the court for an extended period of time, resigning to return to private practice in 1935. = Death of Arthur Maillefert = The 19 year old inmate, Arthur Maillefert, died in the Sunbeam Prison Camp in Florida. He was strangled by the chain that held him in place; he was unable to stand because his feet were in stocks. The Maillefert case of abuse received much attention and was reported in the New York Times. During his time on the court, Gibbs was launched into national fame, due to him presiding over the case involving the death of Arthur Maillefert. Maillefert was a 22-year-old drifter from New Jersey who moved to Florida to try to make it big as a criminal during the Great Depression. After being run out of Dade County in 1930, Maillefert was arrested following an armed robbery at a Daytona Beach gas station. After being caught following his escape, Maillefert was sentenced to 9 years in the Sunbeam Prison Camp, also known as Road Camp 36, near Jacksonville. The prison utilized prisoner labor in order to clear out swampland for the creation of U.S. Route 1. One day while in solitary confinement for refusing to work, Maillefert was able to escape. On June 3, 1932, a guard, Solomon Higginbotham, chased Maillefert with two bloodhounds and recaptured him. The camp's warden, George Washington Courson, personally tied a chain around Maillefert's neck and left him in solitary confinement. When guards checked on him an hour later, Maillefert had asphyxiated. After a sensational article by the New York Times garnered national attention, Courson and Higginbotham were both charged with first-degree murder. Gibbs, presiding over the trial, acquitted Higginbotham and sentenced Courson to 20-years of hard labor. Gibbs retired from the court 3 years later, having served a total of 22 years on the bench. He returned to private practice in Jacksonville. = Florida Attorney General = On May 16, 1938, Governor Fred P. Cone appointed Gibbs as the 26th Florida Attorney General, succeeding Cary D. Landis, who had died in office. While he was in office, World War II began in Europe. In the 1940 commencement address at the University of Florida, Gibbs stressed the importance of patriotism in America, citing the lack of freedoms in Nazi Germany and the quick conquest of the neighboring countries. Gibbs did not seek a full term in the 1940 election, preferring to return to private practice.  Death and personal life  Gibbs died in Jacksonville on September 17, 1946. He is buried in Jacksonville's Evergreen Cemetery alongside his wife, Lenora Bausch. He is succeeded by 4 children. Gibbs was a member of Civitan International, Phi Delta Phi, and Phi Kappa Psi. The George Couper Gibbs residence at 2717 Riverside Avenue in Jacksonville was designed by Mellen Clark Greeley. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Riverside Historic District.

Franquemont (born 1972) is an American textile crafts writer, lecturer and educator, based in Cusco, Peru. She spent her early childhood among the Quechua people of Chinchero, Peru, where \\"women spun to eat and pay for the home they lived in.\\" As a revivalist of the ancient art of hand spinning with the spindle, she published her book, Respect the Spindle, in 2009. Early life and family Chinchero weaver Abigail M. Franquemont was born in Massachusetts. Her parents were anthropologists Ed Franquemont (1945‚Äì2003) and Christine Robinson Franquemont (1948‚Äì2013). According to Ann Peters in Andean Past, Ed and Chris met at Harvard, traveled as hippies with their children to Chinchero, Peru, and settled there to join the community and study traditional knowledge of weaving, construction and agriculture in 1976 \\"in the context of social change\\". They returned to the U.S. around 1982, and by 1985 the family had moved to Ithaca, New York, where the couple continued to research, and to contribute to the community there. Franquemont has a child, Ed, named after her father. Franquemont's younger sister, Molly Anne Franquemont (b. 1975), was reported missing in May 2013. Glen Griggs of Sunnyvale, California was suspected of her murder, but was shot and killed by police in 2014. =Textile arts background= Chinchero spinner Franquemont was born into a textile environment. She remembers \\"falling asleep under her father's loom.\\" Among friends in Chinchero, Franquemont and her sister spent their early childhoods within the hand spinning and hand weaving culture of the local Quechua people, before those ancient skills began to be lost to the influence of Western society, as described in Respect the Spindle (2009). In a world where \\"women...spun to eat and pay for the home they lived in,\\" the Franquemont girls learned to spin alpaca fiber at or before the age of five years,The book, Respect the Spindle, p.65, specifies camelid and sheep fibers hoping to reach a professional standard before adulthood.

The company supplies products for the spinning and fiber arts. It also allows her to pursue her vocation as a fiber arts educator and consultant. She has been described by Interweave as \\"a fiber artist, teacher, technical editor, and writer whose work has appeared in Spin-Off, Spindicity, and Twist Collective\\". =Writing= Peruvian spindle with alpaca fiber In 2009 she published the hand spinning instruction book, Respect the Spindle. The book outlines her personal experience of the place of hand spinning within the indigenous community of Chinchero in the 1970s, discusses the physics of hand spinning with spindles, and describes the techniques required for this. One of the reasons why she has supported the revival of the use of hand spindles is that, as her father said, in comparison with the spinning wheel \\"spindles (are) slower by the hour, but faster by the week.\\" According to Franquemont, he meant that one can use a spindle while travelling or walking around, thus increasing potential spinning time. In the spring 2010 issue of Spin-Off magazine she clarifies the difference between bobbin-driven and flyer-driven spinning wheels. In the summer 2015 edition she discusses the origins of Andean plying. =Videos, teaching and lecturing= She took part in Knitting Daily TV, Series 300 in 2009.

Her pioneering work has shaped feminist theory, ethics and bioethics, and she is considered one of the world's foremost feminist ethicists. Education Sherwin received a B.A. (Hons.) in mathematics and philosophy from York University (1969) and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford University (1974). Her dissertation, ‚ÄúMoral Foundations of Feminism‚Äù, was written under the supervision of Thomas Schwartz, and was the first dissertation in the United States on feminist ethics. Sherwin also completed a post-doctoral fellowship in the Moral Problems of Medicine Project at Case Western Reserve University (1973‚Äì1974). Career Sherwin arrived at Dalhousie University in 1974 as the Department of Philosophy's first female faculty member, later becoming the department's first female chair; she was also an architect of Dalhousie's Gender and Women's Studies program, twice serving as its coordinator. She also was a founding member of the Dalhousie Women Faculty Organization. She served on the Board of Directors of Halifax Transition House, was part of the first equity committee of the Canadian Philosophical Association, and was a founding member of the Canadian Society for Women in Philosophy. Throughout her career at Dalhousie, Sherwin advocated for reform of the university's hiring practices in order to diversify the higher ranks with more women and minorities in positions of power. Sherwin joined the executive of the Dalhousie Faculty Association in 1974, and in this capacity helped start a certification drive for form a trade union for faculty (with the exception of clinical medicine). She was appointed to the negotiating team that drafted and bargained for the union's first collective agreement. She was elected the first female President of the DFA, and the agreement was concluded during her term. Work Sherwin's graduate training began in the logic and philosophy of mathematics, but quickly evolved into health care ethics and feminist philosophy. In the mid-1980s, she combined these two areas of research to consider the implications of a distinctively feminist approach to bioethics. Sherwin's groundbreaking 1992 book, No Longer Patient: Feminist Ethics and Health Care, was the first book-length treatment of feminist bioethical theory, and ‚Äúthe first book that combined feminist philosophy with health care ethics to examine contemporary health issues through a feminist lens‚Äù. Considered a ‚Äúlandmark event in bioethics‚Äù, No Longer Patient is credited with helping define the field of feminist bioethics. The Politics of Women's Health: Exploring Agency and Autonomy (1998), a co-authored volume that Sherwin coordinated, has been described as \\"an examination of both the real world of women's health status and health-care delivery in different countries, and the assumptions behind the dominant medical model of solving problems without regard to social conditions\\". It has received praise as \\"an excellent, insightful book\\" with themes including \\"those of autonomy and agency and the prevalent trend in modern healthcare of concentrating on the patient while ignoring his or her economic and social milieu.\\" Some of this work culminated in recommendations that informed Canada's Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Research Involving Humans. Sherwin was also involved in establishing the International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics, and wrote the lead essay for its inaugural issue. Awards and honors On 6 May 2015, Sherwin was appointed to the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston ‚Äúfor her contributions as a scholar, mentor and leader in the field of feminist bioethics, notably through her writings on discrimination in health care.‚Äù Other honours include: * Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, Dalhousie University, 2017 * Fellow, Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, 2007 * Lifetime Achievement Award, Canadian Bioethics Society, 2007 * Killam Prize in Humanities, 2006 * Distinguished Woman Philosopher, Society for Women in Philosophy, 2004 * Sarah Shorten Award, Canadian Association of University Teachers, 2000 * Fellow, Royal Society of Canada, 1999 * George Munro Professor of Philosophy (Metaphysics), 1999-2002 * President, Dalhousie Faculty Association, 1979-1980  References  Category:Canadian women philosophers Category:Canadian ethicists Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Canadian women writers Category:20th-century Canadian philosophers Category:20th-century Canadian women writers Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:Fellows of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Dalhousie University faculty Category:York University alumni ","title":"Susan Sherwin"},{"id":"59738717","title":"List of PlayStation Vita games (S)"},{"id":"59738739","text":"Gloria Baylis (1929‚Äì2017) was a Barbadian-Canadian civil rights activist, registered nurse and entrepreneur. She won the first-ever case of employment- related racial discrimination in Canada, and later founded the Baylis Medical Company, which was ranked in 2018 as one of Canada's best-managed companies. Early Life and Career Gloria Leon Baylis (n√©e Clarke) was born to Antoinette Margaret Clarke and Reynold Leon Clarke in Bridgetown, Barbados on June 29, 1929. In 1948 she immigrated to England, where she trained in nursing and midwifery. She worked at the Kingston General Hospital from 1948 to 1951, and from 1951 to 1952 at the Chiswick Maternity Hospital and the Myddleton Square Nursing Association. In 1952 Baylis relocated to Montreal, where she met Richard Baylis; they were married on September 22nd, 1956, and together had five children. Their first-born child, Pia Maria, died shortly after birth (February 4th, 1960‚ÄìMarch 16th, 1960). Their four living children are bioethicist Francoise Baylis, Member of Parliament Frank Baylis, social worker and professor Peter John Baylis, and physician Penny Jane Baylis. Baylis continued her nursing career in Montreal, first in private duty from 1953 to 1954, then at the Montreal General Hospital from 1954 to 1957, in which year she became the operating room instructor at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Montr√©al. In 1958 she worked at the Jewish General Hospital, and in 1959 she was assistant supervisor at Reddy Memorial Hospital. In 1960 she returned to the H√¥tel-Dieu Hospital, where she served until 1962 as instructor and head nurse in the operating room. Her Majesty the Queen v. Hilton of Canada., Ltd. Baylis first garnered public attention in 1964 as the defendant in Canada's first employment-related racial discrimination case. The charge was based on new legislation concerning employment practices, introduced in Quebec in the form of ‚ÄúAn Act Respecting Discrimination in Employment‚Äù on September 1st, 1964. According to the Act, ‚Äúany distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, national extraction or social origin, which have the effect of nullifying or impairing the equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation‚Äù constituted discrimination with respect to employment. On September 2nd 1964, one day after the Act came into effect, Baylis visited the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal (then operated by the Hilton chain) to inquire about a part-time nursing position. She was immediately informed that the position had been filled; however, when she called the personnel office the following day, she was told that the position in fact remained vacant and that the hotel was still accepting applications, which was confirmed by subsequent investigation. Realizing that this was a test case for the discrimination legislation, Baylis filed a complaint under the new Act, initiating the first case in Canada to allege employment-related discrimination based on race. As reported by her lawyer Gerald Charness, the presiding judge found that Baylis had been treated differently from all other applicants and that this justified her complaint of discrimination. When Baylis won the case on October 4th 1965, it was the first time in Canadian history that an institution was found guilty of discrimination in employment based on race. For the next eleven years Hilton of Canada appealed, arguing that the legislation was unconstitutional. The original decision was upheld by the Quebec Superior Court on January 19th, 1977. The details of this case are chronicled by Karen Flynn in her article ‚Äú‚ÄòHotel Refuses Negro Nurse‚Äô: Gloria Clarke Baylis and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel‚ÄùKaren Flynn (2018) ‚Äò‚ÄúHotel Refuses Negro Nurse‚Äù: Gloria Clarke Baylis and The Queen Elizabeth Hotel‚Äô Canadian Bulletin of Medical History 35:2, 278-308. doi.org/10.3138/cbmh.256-042018 which was awarded the Canadian Historical Association Hilda Neatby Prize in 2019. Later Career While her case was ongoing in 1964, Baylis obtained employment as Supervisor in the operating room suite of the Catherine Booth Hospital, where she remained until 1969. She also worked at the clinic of physician Henry Morgentaler while his work was still illegal. On June 1st 1970 Morgentaler was arrested and charged with two counts of conspiracy to perform abortions; Baylis was arrested with him, along with two others nurses and a secretary. In 1970 Baylis moved her family to Toronto, where she did private duty work in intensive care and in the operating rooms of most of the city's major hospitals. Near the end of her nursing career, Baylis served as Vice- President of the Board of Directors of the Central Registry of Graduate Nurses from 1983 to 1984. She also served as nurse on-set for two films, Mrs. Soffel (1984) and Youngblood (1986). In addition to her nursing work, Baylis was involved in founding the Ontario Amateur Netball Association (now Netball Ontario) through which she worked to introduce the sport to young Ontarians. In 1985, in recognition of her work in promoting and developing the sport at both provincial and national levels, the government of Ontario honoured Baylis with the Special Achievement Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Field of Fitness and Amateur Sport. Baylis Medical Company After her retirement from nursing, Baylis founded the Baylis Medical Company from her home office in 1983, incorporating in 1986. Beginning as an importer and distributor of medical devices for use in neurosurgery and cardiac electrophysiology (including the first neuro-interventional catheters imported to North America), Baylis turned to research, development and production in 2001. Since then, Baylis Medical Company has collaborated with hospitals to develop state-of-the-art specialized medical devices, and now employs more than 550 people. In recognition of her entrepreneurial accomplishments, Baylis was awarded the 1999 Jackie Robinson award for Business Person of the Year by the Montreal Association of Black Business Persons. She retired from Baylis Medical Company in 2004. She later suffered from Alzheimer's disease and passed away on April 12th, 2017. She was honoured with a poem by George Elliott Clarke, Canada's 7th Parliamentary Poet Laureate.

Congress had passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to authorize federal oversight and enforcement in jurisdictions with historic under-representation of minorities in voting, but many areas of the South were resisting this change. Death Triggs was found, shot in the head, near a wrecked car registered to the wife of Homer R. \\"Kingfish\\" Seale; the body and car were near the highway. Seale was one of the suspects arrested for the murder. According to police chief Claxton Knight, there were \\"no racial implications in the death.\\" \\"Police insist the Triggs killing was not racially inspired.\\" But Rayon Burris, president of the local chapter of the Deacons for Defense, said he had gone to the murder scene at 3 a.m. to tell police about witnesses having seen two white men in a car following Triggs. Burris was arrested at the scene on a charge of interfering with police, taken to the police station for booking, and released after he paid a $100 cash bail. People in the black community and some outside believed that the police were covering up the murder. Homer R. \\"Kingfish\\" Seale and John W. Copling, Jr., both 36, were arrested August 1 on the charge of murdering Triggs; they were freed on bail. They were represented by Baton Rouge attorney Osier Brown. He also represented Ernest Ray McElveen, charged with the murder of Oneal Moore in June 1965 near Bogalusa. Seale was never tried although both he and Copling were indicted. Copling was tried first; the jury deliberated for less than an hour and acquitted him. The details of the killing, and the link, if any, between Triggs and Seale, have never been made public. Triggs' name is listed on the Civil Rights Memorial. His case was reopened by the FBI under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, but has since been closed without resolution.

He was an opponent of Ruhollah Khomeini. He was considered a Qur æan-oriented Scholar or Qur æanist among Iranian Shias. He was the theologian who, unlike the majority of Shia Scholars, called for Ijtihad, and rejected Taqleed. Sangalli was a preacher in the Sepahsalar Mosque. He publicly declared that Shiaism required reformation. Besides, he preached that Islam is not against modernity.Pillars, proofs and requirements of the Quran-Sufficiency Theory, along with its criticism, Profdoc.um.ac.ir, Accessed June 22, 2020A Criticism of the ‚ÄúQura‚Äôn-through- Qura‚Äôn Interpretation Method‚Äù of the Shiite Quraniyan, Pdmag.info, Accessed June 22, 2020 Life and Education Ayatollah Muhammad Hassan Mirza Rida Quli Shari'at-Sanglaji was born in 1891 in Sangelaj, Tehran. His father's name was Shaykh Hasan Sangalaji (d. 1931). He received his early education from his father. He obtained his Islamic Education from the following scholars: # Islamic Jurisprudence (Fiqh) from Shaykh Abdul nabi Nuri # Philosophy (Hikmat) from Mirza Hasan Karmanshahi # Scholastic Theology (Kalam) from Shaykh Ali Mutakallim # Mysticism (Irfan) from Mirza Hashim Ishkivari In 1917, Muhammed traveled to Najaf with his brother Muhammad Sanglaji, where he spent four years. In Najaf, he wrote his first book, which was positively received by Ayatollah Kazim Yazdi. Yazdi gave Mirza Rida Quli the surname of Shariat, or \\"sacred law.\\" In 1921, he returned to Tehran. He died in January 1944 at the age of 53 due to typhus. Teachings and Beliefs The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology states: \\"Modernist tendencies were not limited to Sunni scholars: in Iran, Ayatollah Muhammad Hasan (Riza Quill) Shariat Sangalaji (1890 or 1892-1944) called for Ijtihad instead of Taqlid. And advocated a strictly rational approach to Islam, and prompted his fellow believers to return to the pure origins of their religion by combating superstitions that had distorted its strict monotheism over time. What brought him into fierce conflict with his conservative colleagues was his assessment that also some beliefs traditionally regarded as belonging to the core of Imami Shi'ism are superstitious and must do. For instance, he rated the idea that the Twelfth Imam will return before resurrection to establish justice on earth as an illegitimate addition to Islam (Richard 1988: 166). He condemned the belief that the prophet and the imams are closer to God than ordinary people and can hence you may ask for intercession (shafa't). He also rejected the popular idea that al-Husayn's suffering and death were expiatory self-sacrifices, denouncing it as un-Islamic (Shariat Sangalaji, Tawhid, 63f., 140; Richard 1988:167; for Shi' I modernism in Iran and elsewhere, cf. Nasr 1993).\\" Shariat Sanglaji had the following teachings and beliefs: # He emphatically rejected the Return of the Twelfth Imam and wrote the book \\"Islam wa Rajat\\" to refute this particular Shiite belief. # He was not in favor of sacred intermediaries and considered it polytheism. # He was against tomb worship, and in his book Tawhid-i ibaadat - Yaktaparasti, he quoted narrations that prohibited building on graves and taking them as places of worship. # While some Muslim scholars held the view that prophets like Jesus, Isa, and Khidr are alive, Sanglaji wrote a book Mahwo al Mawhoom to refute this belief. He stated that no prophet, including Jesus, is alive. The Wahhabi-influenced Shia scholar Many Twelver Iranian scholars and writers considered Sanglaji to be an admirer of Wahhabis among Iranian Shias. Even Ruhollah Khomeini refuted Sanglaji in his book Kashf al-Asrar and explicitly attacked his beliefs at least four times. Like scholars Seyed Asadullah Kharaqani and Sheikh Hadi Najm Abadi, Sanglaji adopted a Quranist approach to interpreting the Quran.

Origins In the aftermath of the June‚ÄìSeptember 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Amin Gemayel, convinced that a strong and unified national defense force was a prerequisite to rebuilding the nation, announced plans to raise a 60,000-man army organized into twelve brigades (created from existing infantry regiments), trained and equipped by France and the United States.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 123. In late 1982, the 3rd Infantry Regiment was therefore re- organized and expanded to a brigade group numbering 2,000 men, mostly Sunni Muslims from Southern Lebanon, which became on January 18, 1983, at the southern port city of Sidon, the 3rd Infantry Brigade. Emblem The Brigade's emblem consists of a silvered sword that symbolizes law and strength, emerging from the brown soil of the country, held firmly by the hands of the 3rd Brigade soldiers in the defense of their homeland. The sword is embraced by a blazing flame symbolizing sacrifice, which enlightens Lebanon's blue sky and burns the enemy with his flames, so that the green cedar tree remains eternal, uniting all Lebanese in its heart, the same as the Arabic numeral (3) inserted at the center of the cedar. The emblem also bears the motto \\"Our land is ours\\" written in Arabic script. Structure and organization The new unit grew from an understrength battalion comprising three rifle companies to a fully equipped mechanized infantry brigade, capable of aligning a Headquarters' (HQ) battalion, an armoured battalion (34th) equipped with Panhard AML-90 armoured cars, AMX-13 light tanks (replaced in the 1990s by T-55A tanks donated by Syria) and M48A5 main battle tanks (MBTs),Kassis, 30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon (2003), p. 18. three mechanized infantry battalions (31st, 32nd and 33rd) issued with M113 armored personnel carriers (APC), plus an artillery battalion (35th) fielding US M114 155 mm howitzers. The Brigade also fielded a logistics battalion, equipped with US M151A2 jeeps, Land-Rover long wheelbase series III, Chevrolet C20 and Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups, and US M35A2 2¬Ω-ton (6x6) military trucks. Headquartered at the Mohamed Zogheib Barracks near Sidon, in 1983 it was initially placed under the command of Colonel Nizar Abdelkader, later replaced by Col. Said al-Qaqur, in turn succeeded in 1984 by Col. Adnan el- Khatib.Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), p. 99. Combat history =The Lebanese Civil War= Commanded by Colonel Nizar Abdelkader, the Third Brigade during the Mountain War was split into two separated commands deployed at different locations: some of its battalions were positioned in east Beirut, at the Hadath and the Faculty of Sciences sectors leading to the southern suburbs of the Lebanese Capital,Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), pp. 85-86. while the other units remained stationed at Sidon. During the Battle for west Beirut on February 6, 1984, the Third Brigade's battalions stationed at Beirut's eastern sector provided support to the other Lebanese Army units deployed in the western sector of the city fighting the anti-Government Muslim militias. In late February-early March 1984, the Third Brigade was placed under the command of Col. Said al-Qaqur and its units previously stationed at east Beirut were transferred back to Sidon, taken by ship under the auspices of the Lebanese Navy. At that time, it was presumed that the Brigade would eventually patrol the Southern regions along the Israeli border. Until early 1983, the Sidon-based units of the Brigade could not leave Israeli-controlled areas for training, but that was no longer the case by mid-year. Confined to barracks for most of the time and forced into inactivity, the Third Brigade was finally disbanded on December 1, 1984, by order of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) Command in east Beirut and by 1987 its units had been dispersed.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 222. =The post-civil war years 1990-present= Upon the end of the war in October 1990, the LAF Command proceeded to reorganize and expand the Lebanese Army's battered mechanized infantry brigades structure, with the Third Brigade being officially re-established in Sidon on June 1, 1991.

It is the first large museum that brings together the heritage of a Belgian university and presents it to the general public.,  History  = History of the museum =  Museum of Louvain-la-Neuve  In the United States, all major universities have their own museums, but they are rare in Europe. In this context, Louvain-la-Neuve innovated in 1979 thanks to Professor Ignace Vandevivere who convinced the academic authorities of the UCLouvain to build a museum. The Museum of the Higher Institute of Archaeology and Art History, known as the Museum of Louvain-la-Neuve, was inaugurated on 22 November 1979 within the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts, at the Erasmus College building (n¬∞1, Blaise Pascal square). It is based on the collections of the Institut sup√©rieur d'arch√©ologie et d'histoire de l'art, but also presents works by artist Jo Delahaut as well as sculptures by F√©lix Roulin presented in the open air, with metal tears revealing fragments of human bodies. The museum was one of the only university museums in Belgium open to the public and had a 1,000 m2 space within the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts. It aims to be a place for interdisciplinary encounters, a creative centre for contemporary artists and a space for animation and education. In 1994, by decision of the UCLouvain board of directors, the museum (managed by the non-profit organisation Mus√©e Art Pr√©sent Pass√©) was detached from the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts and the Department of Archaeology and Art History to become a general scientific entity within the university.  Aborted projects for a new museum  In 1990, the director of the Ignace Vandevivere Museum planned to build a new museum on the shores of the Louvain-la-Neuve lake and asked the Japanese architect Risho Kurokawa to draft a project. The project foundered in 1996 and gave way to a more modest sketch next to the Aula Magna, designed by Philippe Samyn, around 2000. This 4,000 m2 museum should have been constructed in 2003 but unlike its neighboring Aula Magna, was never built. In 2006, the founder of the stockbroking firm Petercam and UCLouvain alumnus Jean Peterbroeck, a generous patron, offered 10 million euros for the construction of the new museum. In 2008, on the basis of an international competition in which 38 projects were submitted, the project of the American architects Perkins+Will associated with the Belgian bureau √âmile Verhaegen was chosen. This new 5,000 m2 museum would have been located below the Aula Magna, with a superb view on the lake. It was planned to be a low-energy building, completely curved to follow the contours of the lake, and equipped with a sloping green roof. The UCLouvain sought additional donations to reach a total budget of 18 million euros and obtained the town planning permit in October 2011, when the Peterbroeck family then announced the withdrawal of its donation (withdrawal in which the death of Jean Peterbroeck in May 2011 certainly played a role).

Mus√©e L  Having quadrupled its heritage in thirty years, which had become too narrow and lacking in visibility, the University of Louvain had to find a solution after the aborted projects of 1996, 2003 and 2011. In 2012, Rector Bruno Delvaux explained that the UCLouvain immediately set about seeking another solution, inspired on the actions of its sister university KU Leuven and the University of Ghent. The idea that emerged was to use the iconic Science and Technology Library, located on the Place des Sciences, and transform it in a museum while moving the library to the nearby Lavoisier building. In the end, the library was transferred to the Van Helmont building. The former Science and Technology Library is a building in a brutalist style built by the architect Andr√© Jacqmain between 1970 and 1975, during the construction of the city of Louvain-la-Neuve. It has been one of the most emblematic buildings in the university city since its construction, and was completely renovated from 2015 to 2017 to house the new museum, with Jacqmain's permission. The renovation work begun in May 2015 and lasted two and a half years. The project cost ‚Ç¨10.4 million: ‚Ç¨7.4 million for the renovation of the building, ‚Ç¨2.3 million for the scenography (designed by the Dutch agency Kinkorn) and ‚Ç¨0.7 million for the redevelopment of the museum area. The project is financed by UCLouvain, by the public authorities (including the province of Walloon Brabant, which contributed more than one million euros) and by private patrons (companies and individuals). The new museum is called Mus√©e L: \\"L\\" explained as \\"Louvain\\" but also \\"L\\" as the shape of the square or as the opening wings (ailes in French), according to director Anne Querinjean, in reference to the Columns and Pilasters in the shape of an \\"L\\" or wings that decorate the Place des Sciences as well as the facade and interior of the Science and Technology Library. As the museum of Louvain-la- Neuve, the name is also a reference to its sister city Leuven's (Louvain in French) Museum M. The Mus√©e L is inaugurated on 14 November 2017 in the presence of Princess Astrid, Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve Mayor Jean-Luc Roland, UCLouvain Rector Vincent Blondel and his three predecessors (Marcel Crochet, Bernard Coulie and Bruno Delvaux) as well as numerous local, provincial, regional and federal authorities. It opened to the public on 18 November 2017. File:Belgique - Louvain-la-Neuve - Place des Sciences - 34.jpgLogo of the Mus√©e L on the Place des Sciences.

First, from 1835 to the 1960s, there was no unified museum but the faculties of the Catholic University of Louvain has vast collections, including works from classical and Christian antiquity, casts of works from Antiquity and the Middle Ages, zoological collections, mineral and fossil collections and collections relating to the ethnology of the Belgian Congo:Universit√© catholique de Louvain ‚Äì Muse ‚Äì Mus√©e * 1864: creation of the Archaeological Museum of Louvain by Canon Edmond Reusens. * 1905: collection of the first objects of Greek and Roman archaeology. * 1909: constitution of an archaeology collection at the Faculty of Theology (creating the Bible Museum). * 1914: founding of an African ethnography collection about Belgian Congo for the Institute of Commerce and a collection of classical antiquities. * 1922: acquisition of a large proportion of Susan Minns' Danse Macabre collection * 1920‚Äì1935: installation of the Museum of Christian art, the Museum of Classical Art and the Museum of Egyptian and Oriental Art in Louvain's University Hall. In 1966, two years before the split of the Catholic University of Louvain into a French-speaking and a Dutch-speaking entity, an important legacy of the Brussels industrialist Frans Van Hamme composed of sculptures and paintings from the 14@th to the 18@th century called for the creation of a museum. After the 1968 university split, the Museum of Louvain- la-Neuve was founded, whose collections were enriched over time: * 1975: donation by Abbot Adolphe Mignot of Greek, Etruscan and Southern Italian ceramics. * 1986, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2014: donation by Foundation for Contemporary Belgian Art founder Serge Goyens de Heusch of nearly 2,000 works of Belgian modern and contemporary art; Paintings and an archive collection on art in Belgium in the 20@th century. * 1990: various bequest of Dr. Charles Delsemme. * 1994: donation by the Eug√®ne Rouir and Suzanne Lenoir foundation: more than 1,500 prints from the 15@th to the 20@th century. * 1996 ‚Äì 2010: donation by the Boyadjian family: naive art and popular piety. * 2002: various donations of drawings by contemporary Belgian artists; of the Van Ooteghem legacy; donations from various artists. Thirdly, during the transition period between the Museum of Louvain-la-Neuve and the Mus√©e L, the collections were further enriched: * 2013: clinical anthropology collection of Robert Steichen. * 2015: calculating machine, donated by Luc de Brabandere.  Description  = Collections = On an area of 3,830 m2 accessible to the public, the Mus√©e L presents a permanent exhibition of more than 800 pieces, chosen from among the 32,000 pieces in its reserve, which come from the collections of UCLouvain professors and significant private donations. The collections cover fields as varied as printmaking (D√ºrer, Van Dyck, Goya, Rodin, Picasso...), Belgian 20@th century art (Magritte, Alechinski) and sculpture. The museum does not only present works of art: it also presents the scientific collections of UCLouvain, consisting of specimens of natural history, archaeological and ethnographic objects or machines and inventions with a scientific vocation. The collections are presented through five themes: \\"to be surprised, to question, to transmit, to be moved and to contemplate\\". The museum also has temporary exhibitions and 1,200 m2 of inventory. = Laboratory for the study of works of art = The Laboratory for the Study of Works of Art, founded in the early 1960s by Professor Roger Van Schoute, has as its main objective the study of the museum's collection of Easel paintings in order to improve their knowledge associated, in some cases, with preventive conservation projects. It also offers an expertise service to private individuals. = Public infrastructure = The museum's facilities also include a library, a seminar room, two educational areas, a bookshop, a restaurant, a tea room and a picnic area. An auditorium called Yves & Rainy du Monceau was inaugurated in May 2018. The museum houses workshop spaces that allow school and other audiences to exercise their creativity.

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. His interest in weight conditioning stemmed from a childhood illness. Yet, he matured into an icon in the physical culture world. Early life Pullum was born on 8 April 1887 Camberwell. In 1904, at age 12, he suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and was treated and operated on unsuccessfully at two London hospitals. He then turned to exercise for help. Years later, he claimed, \\"I cured myself of the disease through physical culture methods.\\" At age 17, Pullum saw a stage production by the unparalleled Saxon Trio at the Camberwell Palace of Varieties, and this initiated his desire to become more fit and powerful through a lifetime commitment to weight-training. At the conclusion of the Saxon Trio display, a strength competition was held for local strongmen. The winner of this event, William (Bill) Slade, was destined to play a far-reaching role in young W. A. Pullum's health and future. Pullum in need of local lodging after his parents moved to London, and he wanted to complete his apprenticeship with a local picture frame manufacturer. He found lodgings with the neighboring Slade family, of six brothers, three of whom made a livelihood by competing in strongman competitions. Exercises When the oldest, Bill Slade, noticed the poor physical development of Pullum, he opted to design a course of exercises consisting of deep breathing, strand-pulling, and vigorous exercise with light dumbbells. Following one year of Slade's supervision, with the exercise regimen made progressively more demanding, Pullum was declared cured of tuberculosis by his family doctor. The Slade brothers' association with the Saxon Trio and other traditional strongmen who frequented the stages of London's music halls, enabled Pullum to observe their strength feats from theatre wings and talk to them in their dressing rooms. In 1905, at a height of five-feet, five-inches and weighing 125 pounds, Pullum appeared with the \\"Anglo Saxons,\\" a trio specializing in acrobatic feats and classical weightlifting stunts. In 1906, he set his first unofficial world record of 204 pounds in the two-hand-anyhow lift. Weightlifting club By 1907, Pullum's center of activities became his four-story dwelling in Southeast London, which served as his home, his office, and the Camberwell Weightlifting Club. Here, Pullum entertained and instructed millionaires, champion boxers, weightlifters, and wrestlers while working as a practitioner in remedial physical culture. He believed in instructing his \\"more promising\\" students on an individual basis to produce world-class weightlifters and bodybuilders. Years later, one of his famous gym members included J. Paul Getty who was the world's richest man at one time. Accomplishments Between 1911 and 1915, Pullum won 192 British and world weightlifting records, won 15 British Championships, and was awarded 53 gold medals. Acting as an Olympic coach and technical adviser to the British Amateur Weight Lifters Association, he and his pupils held 222 out of a possible 252 records. At the onset of World War I, Pullum was appointed by the British military authorities to take charge of the conditioning of physically rejected recruits. His conditioning program produced a 95 percent success rate, This led to other fitness training assignments doled out by the British government. Following World War I, Pullum played London's music halls, duplicating a number of feats made famous by the Saxon Trio. His \\"Challenge Dumbbell\\" with its large diameter grip and weighed 185 pounds, was bent-pressed by his right arm, before cleaning-and pressing a 62-pound kettlebell with his left arm. This equated close to a double- bodyweight lift. At age 42, retiring undefeated in strength competition, Pullum's two books; \\"Weight-Lifting Made Easy and Interesting,\\" and \\"How to Use a Barbell,\\" became standard textbooks. Return to training Following a ten year layoff from weight-training, at age 52, Pullum went into strict training and astonished his peers with feats of strength, highlighted by duplicating his original world record of 204 pounds in the two-hand-anyhow lift, which he set in 1906. In 1942, at the height of the bombing of London, Pullum saved a heavy-set woman from death by dislodging her from a ventilating shaft in a bomb shelter where 17 individuals had lost their lives. In the process he sustained serious internal injuries, causing him to undergo two major surgeries. His final stage appearance took place in 1947. Pullum purchased Health & Strength magazine in 1956. Associates later suggested the pressure of working day and night was a factor in his decline in health. Death William Albert Pullum died in 1960, at age 73 and is buried in Camberwell New Cemetery.

The concept is frequently attributed to the traditions of German idealism, particularly the work of Immanuel Kant, and to British empiricism, including the writing of David Hume. Other histories of the concept trace its origin to the humility theory of wisdom attributed to Socrates in Plato's Apology. James Van Cleve describes the Kantian version of epistemic humility‚Äìi.e. that we have no knowledge of things in their \\"nonrelational respects or ‚Äòin themselves'\\"‚Äìas a form of causal structuralism. More recently, the term has appeared in scholarship in postcolonial theory and critical theory to describe a subject- position of openness to other ways of 'knowing' beyond epistemologies that derive from the Western tradition.  Epistemic humility as a virtue  = Epistemic humility and epistemic confidence = According to philosopher of science Ian James Kidd, epistemic humility is a virtue that emerges from the recognition of the fragility of epistemic confidence‚Äìthat is, of \\"the confidence invested in activities aimed at the acquisition, assessment, and application of knowledge and other epistemic goods.\\" For Kidd, any given truth claim rests on three types of confidence conditions: cognitive conditions, or specialized knowledge in a particular knowledge domain; practical conditions, or the ability to perform certain actions required to ascertain the claim; and material conditions, or access to particular objects about which truth claims are made. Moreover, these confidence conditions operate on three levels: agential confidence (conditions for particular epistemic agents); collective confidence (conditions for groups of epistemic agents structured by disciplines, institutions, and other forms of community); and deep confidence (conditions for confidence rooted in 'deep' commitments, such as theories, theologies, or shared cultural inheritances). Kidd argues that the virtue of epistemic humility registers an appreciation for the complexity and contingency of this web of conditions required to make assertions, particularly scientific ones. In Kidd's words, > \\"Colleagues can let us down, shared epistemic practices can be abused, and > institutions can be corrupted. The virtue of epistemic humility therefore > builds in, at the ground level, an acute sense of the fact that epistemic > confidence is conditional, complex, contingent, and therefore fragile.\\" For Kidd, while recognition of the fragility of epistemic confidence is a necessary component of epistemic humility, it is not sufficient. Epistemic humility emerges as a virtue only when such recognition is combined with changes to one's epistemic comportment. That is to say, epistemic humility requires a \\"disposition to regulate one‚Äôs epistemic conduct in the light of one‚Äôs changing fulfilment of relevant confidence conditions. A humble enquirer is disposed, that is, to actively regulate their epistemic conduct, their personal ways of engaging in epistemic activities.\\" Epistemic humility thus entails both recognition of the fragility of epistemic confidence and regulation of one's epistemic conduct accordingly. Kidd offers several examples of how 'humble enquirers' achieve this self-regulation. He writes that > \\"Perhaps they take care to carefully qualify claims to reflect the degree of > confidence they can justify, sharing Montaigne‚Äôs fondness for words and > phrases that ‚Äòsoften and moderate‚Äô the typical ‚Äòrashness‚Äô of our speech ‚Äì > ‚Äòperhaps‚Äô, ‚ÄòI think‚Äô, ‚Äòas far as I know‚Äô (1991, 1165). Perhaps they regulate > their ambitions by ensuring the epistemic projects they commit to are ones > whose constituent conditions they could fulfil ‚Äì aspiring to contribute to, > rather than define, an area of study. Taken together, a humble enquirer is > disposed to actively regulate their epistemic conduct by recognising and > appropriately responding to the complex economy of confidence upon which > their activities and projects rely.\\" Kidd's account of epistemic humility is domain-neutral and applies equally to scientific and humanistic forms of epistemic inquiry that are both simple and complex. = Socratic humility theory of wisdom = Philosopher Sharon Ryan ascribes the notion of epistemic humility to Socrates' conception of wisdom in Plato's Apology. In the Apology, Chaerephon asks the Oracle at Delphi whether anyone is wiser than Socrates, to which the Oracle replies in the negative. Socrates expresses surprise at the Oracle's response because he claims to know nothing. He thus conducts a series of inquiries with those whom he presumes to be wiser than himself‚Äìpoliticians, poets, and craftsmen‚Äìto determine the nature of wisdom. After interviewing the politicians on various topics, Socrates finds that although they claim to know a lot, in fact they know very little. Similarly, although the poets produce verse seemingly rooted in wisdom, they are unable to explain their work. Socrates therefore determines that their poetry derives from divine inspiration rather than from wisdom that they directly possess. Finally, Socrates finds that craftsmen possess some knowledge, which is more than Socrates believes that he possesses. But since he believes the Oracle must be telling the truth, Socrates concludes that the common flaw shared by all three groups is that they all assert that they know things that they do not, in fact, know. Because Socrates does not have this flaw, he concludes that wisdom consists of claiming not to know what one does not know. According to Ryan's reading of this anecdote, \\"[w]isdom is had by those who lack the flaw of thinking they know things that they don't know. Socrates is the only one who lacks this crucial flaw.\\" Ryan claims that this dictum has generally been understood to generate four 'humility principles' about the necessary and sufficient conditions for epistemic humility, depending on one's interpretation of the text. She formulates the first two humility principles as follows: > (HP1) S is wise iff S believes s/he is not wise > (HP2) S is wise iff S believes that S does not know anything. Ryan rejects (HP1) and (HP2) as plausible interpretations of the parable because she believes that they do not offer sufficient conditions of wisdom. She writes: \\"I take myself, and most people I've known, to be clear counterexamples to (HP1). I believe I am not wise and I am right about that. I am not wise. Neither are most people I have known.\\" Ryan elaborates that Socrates himself should be understood as a counterexample to (HP1) in Apology insofar as he recognizes himself to be wise after having solved the puzzle of why the politicians, poets, and craftsmen are not wise‚Äìand nonetheless remains wise. Accordingly, she presents a third humility principle for consideration: > (HP3) S is wise iff S believes that S knows p at t iff S knows p at t. Ryan finds (HP3) more plausible than (HP1) or (HP2) because it shifts the constitutive element of wisdom from the mere presence/absence of first-order knowledge to the reasons that one has to support one's first-order knowledge. She finds this inclusion of a \\"doxastic attitude\\" as a key feature of wisdom to be consistent with Socrates' discoveries. Nonetheless, Ryan ultimately rejects (HP3) as well on the basis that it does not provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for wisdom. She writes that it is \\"possible for a person to have an incredibly well justified belief that is false. If a wise person bad an incredibly well justified belief in p, she would be totally justified in believing that she knows p even if p was false. Thus, she would be totally justified in believing p even though she did not know p.\\" Ryan believes that such a person wise could not plausibly be understood as wise within the context of the text. She thus offers a revision of (HP3) as follows: > (HP4) S is wise iff S believes that S knows p at t iff S is justified in > believing p at t. According to Ryan, (HP4) suggests that wisdom does not require a correspondence between what one believes one knows and what one actually knows. Instead, it requires only that one believes that one knows something only when that belief is justified. Still, for Ryan, (HP4) fails because it does not capture sufficient conditions for wisdom. She argues that (a) one could fail to have enough justified beliefs to be wise, and that (b) that would could have an abundance of justified beliefs but fail to act of them. Ryan thus does not find any of these four humility principles defensible as interpretations of the text. Rather, her reconstruction of the text results in the following alternative conception of epistemic humility: > (Ryan's version) S is wise iff (i) S is a free agent, (ii) S knows how to > live well, (iii) S lives well, and (iv) S's living well is caused by S's > knowledge about how to live well. Ryan explains her interpretation of Socratic epistemic humility as follows: > \\"Only a free agent could have wisdom. A wise person knows how to live well > under a wide variety of circumstances. In addition, a wise person succeeds > at living as best as she can given the circumstances she is in. A wise > person's success at living is caused, in part, by her knowledge about how to > live well.\\"  Kantian humility  In her book Kantian Humility (1998), philosopher Rae Langton posits that Immanuel Kant's argument in Critique of Pure Reason that we can never have knowledge of things-in-themselves‚Äìthat is, knowledge of mind-independent objects‚Äìshould be understood as a doctrine of epistemic humility. As Langton notes, this doctrine \\"is not idealism, but a kind of epistemic humility. There are inevitable constraints on what we can know, inevitable limits on what we can become acquainted with.\\" Following P.F. Strawson's The Bounds of Sense (1966), Langton argues that epistemic humility in Kant's thought emerges as the consequence of the fact of human receptivity and sensibility, i.e. that we are \\"affected by things of which we come to have knowledge\\" via the senses. Langton suggests, however, that to get from receptivity to humility, Kant requires an intermediary argument‚Äìnamely, that an object's appearance is irreducible to its intrinsic properties. James van Cleve explains Langton's basic argument as follows: > \\"Receptivity: Human knowledge depends on sensibility, and sensibility is > receptive: we can have knowledge of an object only in so far as it affects > us. > Irreducibility: The relations and relational properties of substances are > not reducible to the intrinsic properties of substances. Therefore, > Humility: We have no knowledge of the intrinsic properties of substances.\\" According to van Cleve, Langton's irreducibility premise contains three components: first, that the relational properties of objects have causal power, and that by 'sensing' them, we enter into 'causal relations' with them; second, that establishing causal relations with one set of an object's properties does not necessitate establishing such relations with another set of that object's properties; and third, that necessitation in this context should be understood as logical or metaphysical necessity (as opposed to nomological or physical necessity). With these clarifications, van Cleve offers a more robust version of Langton's claim as follows: > \\"Receptivity: We have knowledge only of those properties of things in virtue > of which they enter into causal relations with us. > Irreducibility: The causal relations between things are not necessitated by > their intrinsic properties. Therefore, > Humility: We have no knowledge of the intrinsic properties of things.\\" For van Cleve, clarifying Langton's reconstruction of Kant's argument as a syllogism in this way reveals that the argument is not valid without an additional premise. In other words, van Cleve posits that one could accept (a) that we achieve knowledge of objects only because of certain properties of objects are received by our sense organs (receptivity premise), (b) that we cannot ascertain that such relational properties are direct functions of intrinsic properties of objects (irreducibility premise), and yet conclude, (c) that we can have knowledge of some intrinsic properties of things (violation of humility conclusion). As an example, van Cleve points to philosopher Thomas Reid's discussion the primary qualities of certain objects. He argues that \\"[w]hen we know, as we sometimes do, that one object is round and another square, we thereby know something about how they are in themselves and not just about their relations.\\" As such, van Cleve proposes an additional premise to complete Langton's interpretation of Kant's argument: > \\"Necessitation: A causal relation holds between two things in virtue of > certain of their properties only if necessarily, any two things with those > properties are causally related.\\" Adding this additional premise onto Langton's argument as a whole, van Cleve believes to have reconstructed a sound and valid version of Kant's argument for epistemic humility in Critique of Pure Reason: \\"In brief, there is no knowledge without causation, no causation without necessitation, no necessitation by intrinsic properties, and therefore no knowledge of intrinsic properties.\\"  Critical theory  = Queer history = In Heterosyncracies: Female Sexuality When Normal Wasn't (2005), English scholar Karma Lochrie argues for a measure of epistemological humility to \\"correct the tendencies of medieval scholars to assume heteronormativity of the past based on the presumption of widespread agreement about what heterosexuality means in the present.\\" In this instance, Lochrie uses the concept of epistemological humility as a corrective for anachronism in historico-theoretical scholarship on gender and sexuality. Lochrie uses the term interchangeably with \\"hermeneutic humility,\\" which they define as \\"a hermeneutic of epistemological uncertainty.\\" In the context of queer history, Lochrie elaborates that this entails a twofold commitment to (a) avoid taking for granted the meaning of heterosexuality in the present, and, by extension, (b) avoid assuming a priori heteronormativity as a fundamental organizing principle of the past. Lochrie attributes her use of the concept of epistemological humility as a methodological orientation in queer history to English scholar and LGBTQ activist Judith Halberstram's notion of \\"perverse presentism.\\" Citing Halberstram, Lochrie summarizes the method as the \\"'application of what we do not know in the present to what we cannot know about the past.'\\" As an example, Lochrie discusses the 1998 Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, during which former United States president Bill Clinton argued that 'sex' only refers to heterosexual penal-vaginal intercourse, prompting a debate about what 'having sex' entails‚Äìi.e. whether it includes other acts. Lochrie writes that \\"[h]eterosexuality was‚Äìbriefly during the impeachment hearings‚Äìa matter of debate. Under public scrutiny heterosexuality turned out to be less 'as we know it' then it was 'up for grabs.'\\" For Lochrie, histories that focus on such moments enable us to interrogate the underlying instability of certain analytic categories that we otherwise deem stable in the present, such as heterosexuality, desire, sex, and eroticism; and this, in turn, better positions the scholar to avoid uncritically deploying presentist theoretical categories, such as heteronormativity, as stable analytics of the experiences and practices of the past. In the case of the scandal, Bill Clinton's \\"appeal to heteronormative classification of sexual acts exposed the massive disconnection between the idea of heterosexuality and its practice in understanding the world.\\" = Frankfurt School critical theory and postcolonial theory = In The End of Progress: Decolonizing the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory (2016), critical theorist Amy Allen develops a concept of epistemic humility rooted in postcolonial theory, Frankfurt School critical theory, and French poststructuralism. In particular, she cites the concept in relation to the works of Theodor W. Adorno and Michel Foucault, and positions the concept as a critique of the work of J√ºrgen Habermas, Rainer Forst, and Axel Honneth. While she cites the concept of epistemic humility directly throughout the book, her own theoretization of the concept integrates it into what she calls \\"metanormative contextualism,\\" defined as humility toward one's own second-order normative commitments (i.e. frameworks and procedures through which we justify our beliefs about what 'should be' the case, rather than the beliefs themselves). She argues that this second-order humility toward one's normative commitments can be combined with first-order universalism (i.e. a commitment to the universal applicability of our normative beliefs). In other words, metanormative contextualism presumes epistemic humility insofar as it prescribes that although we can have strong normative convictions, we must forego certainty that the those convictions have justifications that are universal in scope.  Critics  Historian Martin Jay criticizes Allen's concept of 'metanormative contextualism' on two grounds. First, he argues that although Allen's framework is in part a postcolonial critique of European epistemologies, she fails to adequately draw \\"directly on voices from outside Europe,\\" instead relying on the theories of Theodor W. Adorno and Michel Foucault. Second, he claims that Allen upholds an overly idealized version of the 'others' to whom we owe humility. He writes: > \\"Rather than an historically concrete community that can be granted the > status of a distinct form of life with its own immanent norms, it is little > more than an empty placeholder for whatever candidate postcolonial theory > posits as the victim of European imperialism. Nowhere are the dilemmas of > responding to actually existing postcolonial cultures confronted, cultures > that, for all their virtues, may have behaved at times in ways that make > abstention from condemning them morally impossible. Does it really help to > 'hear that which one doesn‚Äôt already understand‚Äô in the case, say, of Rwanda > or ISIS or Boko Haram or the Duarte regime in the Philippines?\\" >  References  Category:Philosophy of science ","title":"Epistemic humility"},{"id":"59739172","text":"Roger Basti√© (21 September 1932 ‚Äì 3 January 2019) was a French rugby coach and player.

Israel's military is one of the most accommodating in the world for LGBT individuals. The country allows homosexual, bisexual and any other non- heterosexual men and women to participate openly without policy-based discrimination. Transgender men and women can serve under their identified gender and receive gender affirming surgery. No official military policy prevents intersex individuals from serving, though they may be rejected based on medical concerns. Israel is the only Middle Eastern country to accept LGBT service members. By demographics =Non-heterosexual personnel= Aluf (General officer) Sharon Afek is the current Chief Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces and is openly gay. He came out in 2017, becoming the first member of the supreme command of the IDF to do so. Gay, lesbian and bisexual soldiers serve throughout all branches of the military. Discrimination against LGBT soldiers in recruitment, placement and promotion is prohibited. Harassment or degradation on the grounds of sexual orientation is also prohibited in the Israeli military. In 2016, the IDF banned a rabbi ‚Äì also co-head of a premilitary academy ‚Äì from visiting bases and called for him to retract statements calling gay people ‚Äúperverts.‚Äù A study conducted by Kaplan and Rosenmann in 2000 found that in terms of unit social cohesion, participants who acknowledged the presence of gay peers did not differ from those who had no such knowledge. The military recognizes same-sex couples, including widows and widowers of the same sex. Life partners of non- heterosexual career soldiers are entitled to 14 weeks‚Äô paid maternity leave and an additional 12 weeks of unpaid leave (regardless of the biological father) unless the other partner has also taken leave. Like heterosexual partners, same-sex partners raising children together who are called up for reserve duty at the same time can ask for one partner‚Äôs service to be postponed ‚Äì whether their child or children are listed as in custody of one or both parents. Children of same-sex couples are eligible for scholarships and nursery school subsidies, even if the career soldier is not the biological parent. In terms of these rights for children of career soldiers, the IDF is more accommodating for same-sex couples than the state. A Gender Affairs unit works to empower the LGBT community in the IDF. As of 2003, soldiers are also allowed to participate in gay pride parades. However, in 2018, the IDF banned soldiers from participating in strikes protesting the exclusion of gay men from a recently passed surrogacy law, as they were considered political demonstrations. Acceptance in everyday life sometimes differs from regulations; a poll conducted in 2011 by the Israel Gay Youth found that 40% of gay soldiers said they were verbally harassed for their sexual orientation, 20% said they had been sexually harassed, and 4% said they had been physically assaulted. Some, such as Noa Halevi, a reserves officer, say that female gay soldiers have an easier time in the army‚Äôs masculine environment. In 2019, an IDF spokesman supported the removal of drawings depicting various family structures ‚Äì including same-sex couples and single parents ‚Äì that had been posted to a base‚Äôs bulletin board for Family Day, as the photos were not in ‚Äúthe spirit of the IDF.‚Äù However, in one instance, a soldier who overheard homophobic comments did report the behavior to his commanders, leading to the punishment of one of the instigating soldiers. Some units are considered more accommodating, such as Unit 8200, a branch that often drafts from the socioeconomic elite and deals with signals intelligence. However, its reputation as a gay-friendly unit is complicated by unit dissenters that objected to Unit 8200‚Äôs collection of information on innocent people ‚Äì including their sexuality ‚Äì for later use as blackmail. Among the public, the Peace Index poll found that a large majority of Israelis say the IDF should espouse a ‚Äúpluralistic and open value system,‚Äù including openness to LGBT soldiers. 81% of those who said they were ‚Äúsecular‚Äù, 76% of ‚Äúnonreligious- traditional,‚Äù 57% of ‚Äúreligious‚Äù, and 52% of ‚Äúreligious-traditional‚Äù support such openness. History of non-heterosexual personnel in the Israeli military In 1956, the Military Court of Appeals heard the case of two male privates sentenced to a year in prison for consensual sex. The General Staff's orders did not mention homosexuality, but civilian law deemed ‚Äúrelations not in the usual way‚Äù a criminal offense. Psychologist Dr. Skali Avraham testified that homosexual behavior was deviant, not criminal. The court accepted the argument and sentenced one soldier to a day in prison and the other, who was ruled to have instigated the encounter, to 70 days. In the 1960s, legal opinions by the Israeli Attorney General and the Supreme Court limited the application of the criminal laws against homosexuality, but the prevailing notion that homosexuality was a disease remained. In 1977, the Military Advocate General, Brig. Gen. Zvi Inbar issued a set of directives ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Trying of Homosexual Soldiers‚Äù ‚Äì to all military prosecutors, instructing them to only file charges against soldiers who broke the civilian law against homosexual acts if: one of the parties involved was a minor, the sex was nonconsensual, one of the parties was unconscious, the sex was conducted in public, or one of the soldiers was under the command of the other. In 1983, the IDF adopted a policy that gay personnel would not be limited or discharged solely based on their sexual orientation, but it did prohibit gay service members from taking intelligence positions, other jobs requiring a top-secret clearance, or serving in elite combat units. Officers were also required to refer known gay soldiers for a psychological evaluation to determine whether they posed any security risks or were mentally unfit for service, though commanders did sometimes disregard this policy. Civilian law decriminalized homosexual acts in 1988. In 1993, the IDF formally opened the draft to all, regardless of sexual orientation. In 1998, the army ceased to link sexual orientation to security clearances and rescinded the order that required commanding officers to report gay soldiers. These policy changes were not well-publicized; a 2003 survey found that only 29% of gay soldier respondents were aware of the 1993 policy. Non-heterosexual personnel are currently allowed to serve openly in the military, including in special units. =Transgender personnel= The Israeli Defense Forces does not consider gender dysphoria to be a disqualifying condition for service. Furthermore, the IDF considers certain transition-specific medical treatments (hormone replacement therapy and gender affirming surgery) and counseling to be medically essential for transgender personnel and thus pays for said treatments. The IDF determines gender specific army regulations (length of service, housing, uniforms, etc.) on a case-by-case basis. However, this is complicated by the fact that Israeli law only allows gender affirming surgery to be performed once an individual is 18 ‚Äì the draft age ‚Äì therefore most individuals joining the IDF would not have the opportunity to transition before joining. Shachar Erez, the first openly transgender person to become an officer in the IDF, underwent gender affirming surgery during his service. During his officers course, he decided to come out to his colleagues and commanders. He graduated as a male officer and continues his service in the department of Behavioral Sciences of the ground forces. History of transgender personnel in the Israeli military While transgender individuals have been allowed to serve in the IDF, more recent policy changes have allowed these individuals to be treated in accordance with their preferred gender. In 2013, the IDF announced that they would, for the first time, allow a transgender woman to serve in the army as a female soldier. The IDF Medical Corps‚Äô Mental Health Division then worked with the Israeli Center for Human Sexuality & Gender Identity to better understand the needs of transgender individuals and raise awareness of those needs within the IDF. In 2014, a new policy was put in place that automatically referred transgender personnel to a support system ‚Äì allowing them to avoid seeking a commander‚Äôs help obtaining uniforms, healthcare, or proper facilities and making it easier to serve as their preferred gender. Showers and housing may be handled on a case-by-case basis while fitness standards for a given position must be met as applicable to their preferred gender. That year, Shachar Erez became the first openly transgender officer in the IDF. =Intersex personnel= Officially, IDF policy does not bar intersex persons from service, though intersex individuals may be found unfit or reassigned due to related medical conditions. Without conclusive data on intersex prevalence in Israel or reports regarding the military service of intersex individuals, a case study by Marom et al. (2008) estimates that there are a ‚Äúfew dozen‚Äù intersex individuals in active service in the IDF. They assume that the condition is likely underreported in data of soldiers in service between 2004 and 2007, or some intersex individuals were ineligible for the draft due to gender dysphoria. In 2010, an intersex Haredi man was initially found to be fit for service in a combat supporting role. Upon his attempt to improve his profile to serve in combat roles, the army determined that he could not enlist at all due to his age ‚Äì 30 ‚Äì though the man himself believes this determination was due to his status as an intersex individual.  By branch  = Israel Defense Forces = In May 2019, the IDF made changes to recruitment forms aimed at adjusting them to be inclusive of soldiers with same-sex parents. Where the form asked for the information of the ‚ÄúFather‚Äù and ‚ÄúMother,‚Äù it now asks for \\"Parent 1\\" and \\"Parent 2.\\" The move was opposed by some orthodox rabbis. = Israel Border Police = The Israel Border Police is a unit within the Israel Police but is a combat ready organ of the Israeli government. Israelis who are drafted for mandatory military service are allowed to choose to serve in the border police. As a part of the police force of Israel, discrimination against LGBT people is prohibited. A violation of these rules does not necessarily result in ejection from the service; in 2018, a police rabbi who made homophobic statements was allowed to keep his job with a warning.

After her actions had earned her a term of imprisonment during the Austrofascist period she fled the country, ending up as in Paris as a member of the French Resistance. Her parents were murdered by the Nazis but five siblings managed to emigrate to England or to the United States. In 1945 the merger combining Germany and Austria was reversed at the insistence of the occupying powers whose military victory had put an end to the Hitler regime. Tilly Spiegel returned to Vienna (where she had spent her student years) and was one of the first researchers to study the histories of victims of National Socialism. Books that she published were frequently consulted and quoted by subsequent researchers.Dolly Steindling: Hitting Back. An Austrian Jew in the French R√©sistance. University Press of Maryland 2000 Wiebke Krohn, Domagoj Akrap: Beste aller Frauen. Weibliche Dimensionen im Judentum. J√ºdisches Museum der Stadt Wien, 2007 Biography =Family provenance= Ottilie Spiegel was born in Novoselica near Chernivtsi in Bukovina, which at that time was a multi-cultural frontier region of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Across the border to the east of Chernivtsi lay the Russian Empire. Ottilie was the eldest of her parents' six recorded children. Karl Spiegel (1880-1941), the children's father, was a businessman. In 1941 both Tilly Spiegel's parents were killed by the authorities in the Izbica \\"transit-ghetto\\", created that year in part of a village in the countryside east of Warsaw and Lublin. =Early years= While she was young the family evidently moved to Vienna, which is where Spiegel attended school. Between 1925 and 1933 she worked at a succession of mostly clerical jobs in the city. At one stage during her time in Vienna she was employed as a gymnastics teacher. Between 1927 and 1930 she also held, in parallel, functions within the Young Communists and was a trades union member. She joined The Party in 1930 after which she combined party duties with her non-political work. By 1933, which is when the party was banned by emergency degree as the country transitioned to post-democratic government, she was working for the party leadership team for the Vienna city and the surrounding region. Subsequently, she continued to work \\"underground\\" (illegally) for the party, serving between 1933 and February 1935, and taking on the party leadership role for \\"District 4\\" (Kreis IV). =Arrest and emigration= Her political activity led to her arrest in February 1935, and in November 1935 she was sentenced to a 18-month prison term. In March 1936 the sentence was reduced to 14 months. In Autumn 1937, still at liberty, Tilly Spiegel emigrated to Switzerland. Here she organised frontier crossing documentation for Austrian Communists transferring via Switzerland to Spain to fight with the International Brigades in the civil war which had been triggered in July 1936 when a group of Spanish generals had staged an attempt to overthrow the increasingly unstable government. Her activity was evidently illegal, and the Swiss authorities arrested Spiegel near the Austrian frontier at Rorschach in May 1937. She was detained and sentenced in nearby St. Gallen and then, in May 1938, expelled from the country. Instead of returning home to Vienna she now crossed the frontier (illegally) into France, settling in Paris where, until the outbreak of war, she supported herself as a gymnastics teacher. =Paris= In November 1938 she teamed up with Marie Pappenheim to establish the \\"Cercle Culturel Autrichien\\" (loosely, \\"Austrian cultural circle\\").Kristina Pfoser-Schewig: Frankreich als Transit- und Niederlassungsland. In: Vertriebene Vernunft. Emigration und Exil √∂sterreichischer Wissenschaft. 2. Internationales Symposium, 19. bis 23. Oktober 1987 in Wien. Jugend und Volk, Wien 1988, p. 940 The \\"circle\\" involved itself in support for refugees and women identified, after war was declared, as enemy aliens and interned in Paris. It was financed from Spiegel's earnings as a gymnastics teacher. On 3 September 1939 France and Britain declared war on Nazi Germany: on the streets of Paris and London eerily little changed, as the governments in those cities waited to see what Chancellor Hitler would do next. The answer arrived on 10 May 1940 when the Geman army invaded and quickly overran the northern half of France, taking over in Paris during the second week of June. From the end of 1940 or early 1941, Tilly Spiegel was actively engaged in resistance work for Travail Allemand (TA), an anti-fascist organisation of German expatriates that increasingly operated as a section of the French Resistance. Most were communists, many had fled Nazi Germany to escape life-threatening political and/or race based persecution. A lot of TA members had fought in the Spanish Civil War, and ended up in France after the Falangist victory. One returnee from the Spanish Civil War who ended up as a TA resistance leader was Franz Marek, a leading Austrian communist intellectual originally from Galicia. It was probably through the TA that Tilly Spiegel met Franz Marek. At some stage they married: much later, in 1974, that marriage ended in divorce. =Resistance= Between 1941 and 1943 Tilly was based in Nancy as a \\"regional TA instructor\\" for Meurthe-et-Moselle. Later she transferred to Lille to undertake similar duties in respect of the Nord department and Pas-de-Calais. Both these areas were in what then Germans had defined as Zone interdite, subjected to additional movement restrictions on local populations and higher levels of Gestapo and military supervision than most of occupied northern France. Sources are understandably vague about the details of Spiegel's resistance work, but there can be little doubt that as a communist resistance member easily identifiable as a non-local, her activities would placed her in extreme danger.Rita Thalmann: Jewish Women Exiled in France After 1933. In: Sibylle Quack: Between Sorrow and Strength. Women Refugees of the Nazi Period. p. 61Helmut Kopetzky: Die andere Front. Europ√§ische Frauen in Krieg und Widerstand 1939 bis 1945. Pahl-Rugenstein 1983, pp. 110, 115‚Äì116 In 1943 the focus of her activities evidently returned to Paris: it was probably in August 1944 that she was arrested by the Gestapo and detained, like her husband, in Fresnes Prison, a short distance to the south of the city. They were scheduled for execution. By the end of the month Paris had been liberated and both were released in the turmoil that accompanied the German military withdrawal. =After the war= In or before August 1945 Tilly Spiegel returned to Vienna where the Communist Party was no longer banned. Indeed, the Soviets had used their influence with the other occupying powers to ensure that there were seven communists in the new government. She rejoined the party's city leadership team (Bezirksleitung), remaining a member of it between 1945 and 1968. In addition, she quickly engaged in the work of building up what subsequently became the Documents Archive of the Austrian Resistance (\\"Dokumentationsarchiv des √∂sterreichischen Widerstandes\\" / D√ñW).Lucyna Darowska: Widerstand und Biografie. Die widerst√§ndige Praxis der Prager Journalistin Milena Jesensk√° gegen den Nationalsozialismus. transcript Verlag, 2014, p. 524 She worked closely with the D√ñW's head of research, Herbert Steiner (1923-2001).

Hermann Langbein Symposium 2007, p. 81 During the 1960s these, Spiegel and the others were among the first researchers into Austria's National Socialist period to focus on the regime's victims. Moser investigated the persecution of Jews while Steinmetz concentrated on government treatment of the Sinti and Romani people. Spiegel worked on what had happened to women and girls engaged in antifascist resistance and Rosenkranz studied Austria's experience of the November 1938 pogrom (\\"Kristallnacht\\").Ren√©e Winter: Geschichtspolitiken und Fernsehen: Repr√§sentationen des Nationalsozialismus im fr√ºhen √∂sterreichischen TV (1955-1970). transcript Verlag 2014, p. 152 During the later 1960s, even before the crushing of the Prague Spring, Spiegel seems to have engaged in major \\"inner-party criticism\\" over the path taken by postwar communism.

The functional group has two major resonance forms, a diazen-2-ium-1-ide form, and an aminonitrene form: frameless Although isodiazenes are formally isoelectronic with ketones and aldehydes, the reactivity of this exotic functional group is very different. They are generally prepared by oxidation of the hydrazine (R2N‚ÄìNH2), reduction of the 1,1-diazene oxide (R2N‚ÄìN=O), 1,1-elimination of MX from R2N‚ÄìNMX (M = Na, K; X = SO2Ar), or treatment of secondary amines with Angeli's salt, Na2N2O3, in the presence of acid. Isodiazenes participate in cycloaddition reactions with alkenes to generate N-aminoaziridines. In the absence of other reactants, they undergo reactions in which N2 is eliminated to give an organic residue or residues through both concerted and nonconcerted pathways. Cyclic isodizenes in particular readily undergo cycloreversion and chelotropic elimination reactions. Some of these reactions are believed to be concerted pericyclic processes, as evidenced by stereospecificity that is consistent with the conservation of orbital symmetry. alt=The absence of cyclobutane from the decomposition of the isodiazene derived from the saturated 5-membered azacycle is evidence against radical intermediates, and the process is also believed to be concerted and pericyclic. 300x300px Due to the facile elimination of N2, most isodiazenes can only be isolated in a matrix at cryogenic temperatures.

She is remembered for her involvement in the Finnish women's movement, especially as chair of the Finnish women's rights organisation Suomen Naisyhdistys and as the founder and editor of the women's journal Naisten √Ñ√§ni (Women's Voice). She travelled widely, promoting understanding of Finland abroad while participating in international conferences and contributing to the foreign press. Biography Born on 5 January 1861 in Kankaanp√§√§, Maria Elisabeth Friberg was the daughter of Karl Arvid Friberg and Fanny Adelaide Boijer. After her father's early death, her mother moved with the children to Tammerfors where she opened a guest house. Friberg attended the Swedish School for Women in Helsinki where she matriculated from the teacher training class. In 1883, Friberg obtained a teaching post in Helsinki's folk high school which she held until 1912. She studied in Berlin and Zurich, graduating from the University of Bern in 1897 with a thesis on Nordic folk law. Thereafter she attended lectures on economics at the University of Brussels, becoming fluent in German, French and English. Until 1906, she made frequent study trips around Europe, perfecting her experience of teaching methods. She also became acquainted with other Scandinavians, especially Danes. While travelling in 1906, Friberg became interested in the women's movement, attending various conventions and congresses, where she frequently represented Kvinnosaksf√∂rbundet Unionen (the Union Women's Association). In 1906, at the International Alliance of Women meeting in Copenhagen, her views on voting rights were particularly welcome as that year Finnish women had gained the right to vote. At this stage, she was especially interested in pacifism and temperance. She nevertheless continued to spread knowledge about Finland, giving lectures about Finnish and Sami schools in Germany, Austria and Denmark, including the Russian government's policy of limiting Finnish autonomy. With 30 years of increasingly wide teaching experience, in 1912 Friberg applied for the position of Deputy Inspector of the Helsinki Folk Schools but the appointment was given to Guss Mattsson of the Helsinki City Council, the authority organizing the selection. She was so upset that she decided to give up teaching, preferring to devote her time to women's issues. A member of the Finnish Women's Association from 1889, serving on the board from 1907 to 1924, and of the Union Association, which she co-founded in 1892 and chaired from 1920 to 1927, Friberg was also active in the Finnish peace association Finlands Fredsf√∂rbund. She also contributed articles to Finnish and foreign newspapers and founded her own magazine Naisten √§√§ni (Women's Voice) in 1905 which she edited until her death. In 1909 in Naisten √§√§ni, she published an account of the International Alliance of Women congress in London. Maikki Friberg died in Helsinki on 6 November 1927.

This genus includes species that were formerly included in the genus Lasiurus. Taxonomy The genus was initially described by Austrian zoologist Leopold Fitzinger in 1870. Based on genetic divergence within Lasiurus, Baird et al. recommended that the hoary bats be recognized as a separate genus. They additionally recommended that Dasypterus should be elevated from a subgenus to a genus as well. However, as Lasiurus was previously monophyletic, some authors see the creation of two new genera--Aeorestes and Dasypterus--as a solution to something that was not a problem. Teta advocated using Aeorestes as a subgenus and retaining the usage of Dasypterus as such. In a 2017 follow- up to their 2015 study, Baird et al. again expressed that Aeorestes, Dasypterus, and Lasiurus should be separate genera comprising the tribe Lasiurini. They stated that the genetic distance of the three genera was much greater than observed between other bat genera, on average. In contrast to the average of 12.0% inter-generic divergence reported from another study on bats, Aeorestes and Dasypterus varied 18.79%; Aeorestes and Lasiurus varied 19.05%; and Dasypterus and Lasiurus varied 19.79%.

History  Tarraville was established as a village in 1841, when the land was selected as part of the Reeve's Special Survey. Its name comes from the Tarra River, which is named after Charlie Tarra, an Aboriginal who travelled with Pawe≈Ç Strzelecki when he explored Gippsland. The wreckage of the PS Clonmel was an influence on the founding of Tarraville. Because Tarraville was founded on a path to Port Albert, it grew quickly, containing about 50 buildings at the end of 1844. In 1851, it became a government township, after having been a private township since 1843. In the 1850s, when people travelled from Port Albert to fields in Omeo when gold had been discovered there, Tarraville was used as a stopping point. At this time, it was the largest town in Gippsland, containing many buildings, including multiple businesses and seven hotels. In 1850, a private school opened in the town, but closed in 1852. In 1856, a public school opened, and in 1859, a mechanics' institute hall was built. A tollgate was built at the entrance to Tarraville in 1860. Tarraville's population and activity decreased in the late 1870s, after a railway was built going from Melbourne to Sale. Few buildings were left in Tarraville by the early 1900s. In 1903, most of the edges of the town were sea and the only public buildings left were a hotel, a school, three churches, a library, and a mechanics' institute. The school closed in 1988. Currently, Tarraville's Anglican Church is the only remaining public building aside from the closed school. The town in the present era has been described by The Sydney Morning Herald as a \\"sleepy town\\" and \\"little of importance\\". According to a book by the United States Government Publishing Office in 1920, one could travel from the town to Port Albert using a coach and to Melbourne using a railway.  Population  The census of 1851 revealed the population of the town to be 219. It increased to 227 in 1871, but decreased to 150 in 1911. The population dropped further to 105 in 1947 and grew slightly to 125 in 1961. In the 2016 census, the total population was 80, and 53.2% of people were male and 46.8% female. There were about 20 families, an average of 0.4 children per family, and a median age of 51. Households were 66, with an average of 1.8 people per household.  Church  Tarraville contains an Anglican church, built by J. H. W. Pettit and George Hastings in 1856. Constructed of wood, the church has been painted blue and cream. It has attracted attention from visitors, due to being the second oldest timber building in Victoria and the oldest church in Gippsland. As of 2011, the church no longer provides services.

He was of Serbian origin. Naval career The Dabiƒá family had several officers in the Russian military, the most prominent among them is Vice-Admiral Nikolai Dimitrievich Dabiƒá. Nikolai's great grandfather was sergeant major Zaharije Dabiƒá, who in February 1754 is mentioned as living in the newly-established Russian province Slavo-Serbia under commanders Rajko Depreradoviƒá and Jovan ≈†eviƒá. Vice-Admiral Nikolai Dimitrievic Dabiƒá was born in Kherson on 23 April 1857. His brother was Aleksandar Dimitrievich Dabiƒá (1855 - 1880), a lieutenant in the navy. Dabiƒá entered the Imperial Russian Navy at the age of 12. He was educated at the prestigious N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy in Saint Petersburg, and in 1877 was promoted to michman.

The poem describes a witch in the night, then describes her as an unconventional housewife, and concludes with reference to Carl Dryer's The Passion of Joan of Arc. The refrain parodies popular advertising techniques of the 1960s, specifically capitalist \\"This Is Your Wife,\\" campaigns that reduced women to mere performers of a multitude of perfected social roles. \\"Her Kind\\" was published in Anne Sexton's first book, To Bedlam and Part Way Back, against the advice of her mentor, John Holmes. He warned her that she would regret her transparent and confessional style. Sexton understood this advice as Holmes' desire to censor her, and dedicated the first poem of the book's second section to him (\\"To John, Who Begs Me Not to Enquire Further\\"), after composing a letter she never sent to him. \\"Her Kind\\" was always the first poem read by Sexton at public readings, and Sexton admitted that she derived an \\"orgasmic\\" pleasure from her performance. Sexton once referred to her performance personality as a \\"little bit of a ham,\\" and gave her readings only in fashionable outfits that bordered on the theatrical. She always had her nails polished and painted, a standard she had maintained since her modelling career. It has been noted that Anne's own performance of femininity was inspired by her distant mother, Mary Gray Harvey. In her life, Harvey was celebrated for her unusually composed feminine demeanor and grand intellectual presence, only the latter she passed on to Anne.  Context  Writing throughout the Cold War, Sexton was keenly aware of the economic importance of American housewives in the 1960s. \\"Her Kind\\" concludes with an \\"[un]ashamed\\" (20) confession of suicide-desire that individualizes death against a twentieth-century backdrop of genocide and survival anxiety.  Themes  = Motherhood during the Cold War = Sexton's own disillusionment with motherhood is portrayed in her speaker's self-depiction as a witch who tends to the \\"worms and the elves\\" (11). Instead of human children, worms and elves insinuate a certain perversity within the family unit, beginning with the witch mother. As homemakers, many 1960s American housewives were expected to perform the duty of motherhood, and their failure to perform maternal care would result in disapproval and shaming from their suburban peers. Sexton, however, stated that instead of children, it was writing that \\"gave [her] a feeling of purpose, a little cause.\\" Sexton's extreme incompatibility and dissatisfaction with motherhood as depicted in \\"Her Kind\\" was socially considered to be a poor reflection upon both her family and the United States. = Witches and communism = In an interview with Gregory Fitz Gerald, Sexton joked, \\"The Puritans would have burned me at the stake, of course.\\" In \\"Her Kind,\\" Sexton willfully identifies herself as a witch when she describes the various forms of social rebellion she has performed. In the first stanza, the witches' movement from the private sphere to the public sphere uses threatening diction, such as \\"haunting\\" (2), \\"dreaming evil,\\" and \\"done my hitch\\" (3) to portray sexist and capitalist fears of women in the public arena. While the Cult of Domesticity located American women inside the home, under communism women were encouraged to work in the public sphere. The sinister language used in the first stanza aligns the witches' physical agency with the then American paranoia of communism, and her voyage outward to the \\"warm caves\\" subverts conventions of motherhood in an animalistic fashion. However, the witch does still perform the domestic duties of a housewife as Sexton illuminates the mental consequences of automatically socializing girls and women into only maids, cooks, mothers, and homemakers. The third stanza references Joan of Arc, the French icon who was burned at the stake in 1431 for the witch-like charge of summoning demons, but was later declared a saint in 1920. Sexton's reference diffuses the significance of patriarchal labels as it is a reminder that the socially established distinction between a \\"witch\\" and a \\"saint\\" is both subjective and ambiguous. In the second stanza, the witch attempts to perform domestic life inside the cave by filling it with common household objects and cooking dinner, but her consumerist approach at maternity is ultimately void of personal significance or meaning beyond her obligation to perform motherhood. This section of the poem reflects the context of America's rising GDP from 1945‚Äì1960, because women then began to substitute their fragmented female identities with concrete commercial products in the consumerist craze. Anne Sexton even spent her Guggenheim grant money on a swimming pool as an outward, performative assertion of her successful middle-class American life. In a letter to her mother, Sexton wrote \\"my heart's desire is an electric mix-master with the orange juice squeezer on top.\\" Sexton's covert sarcasm is both an extension and a critique of the advertisement-crazed America as she experienced it. In an interview with Patricia Marx, Sexton referred to the \\"brainwashing pablum of advertisements every minute\\" that she subtly mocks with the refrain in \\"Her Kind.\\"  Criticism  Sexton sought to distance herself from what she described as \\"over-literary, over-intellectualized\\" early post-war poetry. The most common complaint against Sexton's work, however, and especially so in To Bedlam and Part Way Back, is a perceived over-indulgence of the self, a hallmark of \\"confessional poetry.\\" John Holmes refuted her work on a fundamental level, stating that \\"her motives are wrong artistically.\\" Likewise, James Dickey found himself unable to appreciate Sexton's confessional style because it was too transparently autobiographical. By contrast, other critics such as Robert Phillips and Laurence Lerner contend that the often exposed biographical content of confessional poetry displays bravery on the author's behalf. Even though Sexton's confessional poetry is not solely rooted in fact, critics like Patricia Meyer Spacks asked, \\"How can the reader properly respond to lines as grotesquely uncontrolled as these?\\" References Category:1960 poems Category:American poems Category:American satirical poems Category:Feminist literature Category:Poetry by Anne Sexton ","title":"Her Kind (poem)"},{"id":"59739888","text":"Bagdah or Bagdaha may refer to: * Bagdah (community development block), a community development block in the state of West Bengal * Bagdah, North 24 Parganas, a village under the Bagdah CD Block * Bagdah (Vidhan Sabha constituency), a Vidhan Sabha constituency of West Bengal Others * Bagdah High School, a higher secondary school situated at Bagdah * Bagda, a village in Kutch district in Gujarat * Bagdaha, Nepal, a village development committee in Sarlahi District in Nepal ","title":"Bagdah"},{"id":"59739916","text":"Big John Hamilton may refer to: * Big John Hamilton (actor) (1916-1984), American actor * Big John Hamilton (vocalist), American vocalist ","title":"Big John Hamilton"},{"id":"59739938","text":"Frankie J.

Salm was appointed by Caliph Yazid I (r. 680‚Äì683) as governor of Khurasan and Sijistan in 681. During the course of his governorship, he launched several expeditionary raids into the Central Asian regions of Transoxiana, including Samarkand, and Khwarazm. His successes and generous distribution of war booty among his Khurasani Arab troops gained him wide popularity with them, but after Yazid died, Salm was not able to maintain their loyalty to the Umayyads for long. After his troops and chosen successor, Abd Allah ibn Khazim al-Sulami, gave their allegiance to the rival caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Salm made for Basra. There, he ultimately joined Ibn al-Zubayr's camp, but was imprisoned in Mecca by the latter nonetheless. After paying a large bribe, he was released and following Ibn al-Zubayr's death at the hands of the Umayyads in late 692, he was reappointed governor of Khurasan. However, he died before he could resume his duties. Life Salm was the third eldest son of Ziyad ibn Abihi, the Umayyad governor of Iraq and virtual viceroy of the eastern part of the caliphate.Bosworth 1995, p. 997. By the time of Ziyad's death in 673, his family maintained a strong footing in the eastern caliphate; Ziyad was replaced with Salm's brothers Ubayd Allah in Iraq, Abd al-Rahman in Khurasan, and Abbad in Sijistan. A year after Yazid I succeeded his father Mu'awiya I as caliph in 680, he appointed Salm governor of Khurasan and Sijistan in place of his brothers. In turn, Salm appointed another of the brothers, Yazid, as his deputy governor in Sijistan. Prior to his arrival at the provincial capital at Merv, Salm assembled a select force of 2,000 tribesmen at Basra, among which were several leading Arab nobles, including the veterans al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra of Azd, Abd Allah ibn Khazim of Banu Sulaym, Talha ibn Abdillah of Khuza'a and Umar ibn Ubaydillah ibn Ma'mar of Banu Tamim.Shaban 1979, pp. 39‚Äì40. One of Salm's first actions upon arriving at Merv was the arrest and public condemnation of the powerful Arab chieftain Qays ibn al-Haytham al-Sulami, who had been empowered by Salm's brother Abd al-Rahman.Shaban 1979, p. 40. According to historian Muhammad Abdulhayy Shaban, his arrest was an effort by Salm to gain the support of the influential chieftain Aslam ibn Zura'a, who had been imprisoned and extorted by Qays, and to signal a departure of Abd al-Rahman's policy of redirecting the revenues of Khurasan to Damascus instead of among the province's troops for expeditions. Depending on the source, Salm either sent Caliph Yazid one- fifth of the war booty his forces acquired with the rest distributed among the troops or he distributed all of the booty between himself and the troops. As a result of this policy and successes on the battlefield, Salm gained wide popularity among the troops. Indeed, the 9th-century historian al-Tabari recorded: > \\"The people of Khurasan never loved a governor as they loved Salm [ibn] > Ziyad. In those two years when Salm was there, more than 20,000 children > were named Salm because of their love for Salm.\\" ‚Äî Ali ibn Muhammad, a > certain Arab shaykh (tribal chieftain) from Khurasan cited by al- > Tabari.Hawting 1989, p. 71. Salm scored victories and gains during his raids across the Oxus River against the Soghdian princes of Transoxiana and Samarkand in Central Asia. He is credited as the first Arab commander to encamp in territory east of the Oxus during the winter.Levy 2000 [1957], pp. 19‚Äì20. Previously, the Arab armies, which had been crossing east of the Oxus from 671, refrained from camping there in the winter because they were unaccustomed to the severe Central Asian cold and the consequent need for heavier, warm clothing. His wife, Umm Muhammad bint Abd Allah, a granddaughter of Uthman ibn Abi'l-As al-Thaqafi, crossed with him and became the first Arab woman to cross the Oxus.Howard 1991, p. 187.Bosworth 1968, p. 169. She gave birth to one of his sons, whom they named Sughdi in honor of his birthplace, Sogdhia.Kennedy 2007, p. 237. Salm also led raids into the Khwarazm. However, his deputies in Sijistan and Zabulistan, the latter was under the command of is brother Abu Ubayda, were not able to emulate Salm's successes in the region that corresponds with modern-day Afghanistan. There, the Zunbils of Zabulistan and the shahs of Kabul put up stiff resistance against the Arabs, and Yazid and Abu Ubayda were ultimately slain and captured, respectively, during military expeditions against them. Following Caliph Yazid's death and the chaos that ensued due to the uncertainty of leadership in the Umayyad capital in Syria, Salm initially maintained the allegiance of Khurasan's Arab troops to the Umayyads. However, they soon after defected and Salm was forced to abandon the province for his brother Ubayd Allah's headquarters in Basra. His chosen successor, Abd Allah ibn Khazim al-Sulami, meanwhile emerged to dominate the eastern caliphate and paid allegiance to the anti-Umayyad, Mecca-based claimant to the caliphate, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Unlike Ubayd Allah, Salm decided to join Ibn al- Zubayr's cause, but Zubayrid loyalists nonetheless arrested him in Basra and brought him to Mecca where he was held captive. Ibn al-Zubayr had extorted Salm, who ultimately paid the former four million dirhams, which he acquired in the course of his governorship over Khurasan, to secure his freedom. He remained in Mecca until the Umayyad general al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf besieged Ibn al-Zubayr. Salm was pardoned by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik, who restored him as governor of Khurasan. However, before he could reach the province, Salm died in Basra in 692. A grandson of Salm, Maslama ibn Muharib ibn Salm (died between 765‚Äì785), was a Basra-based historian whose reports were used in the histories of 9th-century historians al-Mada'ini and al-Tabari.McAuliffe 1989, p. 18, n. 93.

Biography His father Caspar Jungermann (1531‚Äì1606) was a professor of law in Leipzig, his mother Ursula Camerarius (1539‚Äì1604) the daughter of the humanist Joachim Camerarius the Elder (1500-1574), a colleague and friend of Philipp Melanchthon. After studying medicine, Jungermann first lived in Nuremberg and then became professor of anatomy and botany in Giessen from 1614 to 1625. In 1616 he refused an appointment to the renowned Chair of Botany in London as successor to Matthias Lobelius, just as he had not followed previous appointments to the Universities of Rostock and Rinteln. In Gie√üen he laid out the botanical garden (Hortus medicus). Today it is the oldest botanical garden in Germany, still standing in its original location. In 1625 he accepted a professorship for anatomy and botany at the University of Altdorf in Altdorf. There he also headed the Hortus medicus. Jungermann was the first botanist to publish local floren. A flora from Altdorf was published in 1615. His flora from Giessen, Cornucopiae Florae Giessensis and the Catalogus herbarum circa Giessam (both from 1623) are lost today. In addition to the two floras, he published the Hortus Eystettensis together with Basilius Besler in Nuremberg as early as 1613. Jungermann was already regarded by his contemporaries as \\"vir botanicorum nemini secundus\\". He is said to have noticed that he would only marry when he was brought a plant that he could not identify. He died unmarried.

The union was founded in 1890 as the Amalgamated Society of Plate and Machine Moulders. It was based in Oldham, and was led by Samuel Howard. In its early years, it worked with the Friendly Society of Iron Founders, both agreeing to respect the others' strikes. However, the moulders remained a small union, and by 1906 it had only 950 members. The union was one of six founders of the Federation of Moulders and Collateral Trades, in 1906, but the federation achieved little, instead becoming a venue for the competing unions to argue over lines of demarcation and not respecting each other's industrial action. The federation dissolved in 1910, but this led the unions to work together more productively, and from 1912 they negotiated together on pay and conditions. The union grew more rapidly during World War I, as moulding was increasingly done using machines. By 1918, the union was significant member of the new National Federation of Foundry Trades. The National Union of Foundry Workers (NUFW) repeatedly encouraged the moulders union to merge into it, but this did not occur. In 1966, it finally joined the successor to the NUFW, the Amalgamated Union of Foundry Workers, at which time it had about 2,000 members.

They were developments of the s, with reductions in size and speed to offset increases in the armour protection whilst retaining the same main battery of eight guns. Completed in late 1917, Ramillies saw no combat during the war as both the British and the German fleets had adopted a more cautious strategy by this time owing to the increasing threat of naval mines and submarines. Ramillies spent the 1920s and 1930s alternating between the Atlantic Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet. Whilst serving in the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the early 1920s, the ship went to Turkey twice in response to crises arising from the Greco-Turkish War, including the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. She also saw limited involvement during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The ship's interwar career was otherwise uneventful. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Ramillies was initially assigned to escort duties in the North Atlantic. In May 1940, she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as war with Italy loomed. After the Italians entered the war in June, Ramillies bombarded Italian ports in North Africa, escorted convoys to Malta, and supported the Taranto raid in November. The ship returned to Atlantic escort duties in 1941, during which time she prevented the two s from attacking a convoy; she also joined the search for the battleship . In late 1941, Ramillies was transferred to the Eastern Fleet as tensions with Japan rose; the following year, she was the flagship for the invasion of Madagascar. While moored there, she was torpedoed and badly damaged by Japanese midget submarines. The ship was updated for coastal bombardment duties in 1944, which she performed later that year during the Normandy landings in June and the invasion of southern France in August. In January 1945, the worn-out battleship was withdrawn from service and used as a barracks ship attached to the training establishment . She was ultimately broken up in 1948. Design and description Illustration of sister ship as she appeared in 1916 The Revenge-class super-dreadnought battleships were designed as slightly smaller, slower, and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal, but First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher rescinded the decision to use coal in October 1914. Still under construction, the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired boilers that increased the power of the engines by over the original specification. Ramillies had a length overall of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She had a designed displacement of and displaced at deep load. She was powered by two pairs of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam provided by eighteen Babcock & Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 1 October 1917, the ship reached a top speed of only from . She had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 909 officers and ratings in 1916. Her metacentric height was at deep load. The Revenge class was equipped with eight breech- loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen BL Mk XII guns were mounted singly in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. The ship also mounted four 3-pounder () saluting guns. Her anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20cwt Mk I guns. She was fitted with four submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. Ramillies was completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the spotting top above the tripod foremast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by 'X' turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in April 1917. A torpedo-control director with a 15-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure. The ship's waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 4to 6inches (102 to 152mm) towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6inches thick that extended between 'A' and 'X' barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4to 6inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to 'A' and 'Y' barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4to 6inches thick below it. The Revenge-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower had 11 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines. The ship was fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on the roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. She was also equipped to handle a kite balloon around this same time. That same year, a Sopwith Pup fighter was flown off from the platform on B turret at least twice. During the early 1920s a Fairey Flycatcher fighter was deployed from that same platform. In 1927 a rotating aircraft catapult was installed on Ramilliess quarterdeck. It was removed during her 1929‚Äì1931 refit. The flying-off platforms were removed in 1932‚Äì1933. A catapult was added on the roof of 'X' turret by September 1936 as well as a crane to handle the aircraft. =Major alterations= The existing rangefinders in 'B' and 'X' turrets were replaced by models in 1919‚Äì1921 and her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded by the replacement of the original three-inch AA guns with a pair of QF AA guns during a short refit in 1924. Ramillies was refitted in 1926‚Äì1927, when her bulge was extended above her waterline and the \\"crushing tubes\\" were removed from most of the lower bulge. An additional pair of four-inch AA guns were added, the six-inch guns from the shelter deck were removed and a simple high- angle rangefinder was added above the bridge. During a more extensive refit in 1933‚Äì1934, a High-Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director replaced the high- angle rangefinder on the spotting top and another replaced the torpedo director aft. A pair of octuple mounts for 2-pounder () Mk VIII \\"pom-pom\\"s were added on platforms abreast the funnel and directors for them were fitted on the foremast. A pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machineguns were added abreast the conning tower and the mainmast was reconstructed as a tripod to support the weight of the second HACS. In addition the aft torpedo tubes were removed. By June 1938 the single mounts of the AA guns were replaced by twin mounts, the forward torpedo tubes were removed, a radio-direction finding office was added and the catapult was removed. Wartime modifications for the Revenge-class ships were fairly minimal. A pair of four-barrel \\"pom-poms\\" were added in late 1941 atop 'B' and 'X' turrets as well as ten 20mm Oerlikon cannon that replaced the quadruple .50-caliber mounts. By 1943 Ramillies was fitted with a Type 279 early-warning radar, a Type 273 surface-search radar, a Type 284B gunnery radar for the main guns, a pair of Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery sets and two Type 282 radars for the \\"pom-poms\\". A Type 650 radio- guided missile jammer was added before June 1944. To save weight and make more room available for the additional crew required to man the new equipment like the radars and Oerlikons, four 6-inch guns were removed in 1943. In April of that year, 10 more Oerlikons were added and an additional three in 1944‚Äì1945. Service history =Construction and the First World War= Painting of Ramillies depicting the vibrant colours and irregular shapes that characterised dazzle camouflage during the First World War Ramillies, the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was laid down at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard in Dalmuir, Scotland, on 12 November 1913. During construction, the decision was made to fit the vessel with anti- torpedo bulges, since her hull was the least complete of the members of her class. She was christened Ramillies after the 1706 Battle of Ramillies and was launched on 12 September 1916, but she struck the slipway, badly damaging the bottom of her hull and her rudders. Since the dry docks in Dalmuir were not long enough to accommodate Ramillies, she would have to be towed to the Cammell Laird shipyard in Liverpool. The ship was not seaworthy, however, so temporary repairs were effected in Dalmuir before she could be towed to Liverpool. Captain Henry Doughty was appointed in command on 11 April. The initial repairs were completed by May 1917, and she departed on 7 May; she ran aground on the way and had to be pulled free by eight tugboats on 23 May. These accidents significantly delayed completion of the ship compared to her sister ships, and she was the last member of the Revenge class to enter service with the Grand Fleet. Captain Percy Grant relieved Doughty in July and the ship was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron in September 1917. Ramillies conducted extensive sea trials to determine what effect the bulges had on her speed and stability, and when it became clear that the bulges did not significantly reduce her speed and in fact improved stability, the Admiralty decided to install them on all four of her sisters. After the Action of 19 August 1916, in which the Grand Fleet had lost two light cruisers to German U-boat attacks, Admiral John Jellicoe, the fleet commander, decided the fleet should not be risked in such sorties unless the German High Seas Fleet ventured north or the strategic situation warranted the risk. For its part, the German fleet remained in port or trained in the Baltic Sea through 1917, as both sides had largely abandoned the idea of a decisive surface battle in the North Sea. Both sides turned to positional warfare, laying fields of naval mines, and Germany resumed the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign early in the year. As a result, Ramillies and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no action during the last two years of the war. In 1917, Britain began running regular convoys to Norway, escorted by light forces; the Germans raided these convoys twice late in the year, prompting Admiral David Beatty, who had replaced Jellicoe the previous year, to send battle squadrons of the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. The High Seas Fleet went to sea on 23 April to attack one of the escorted convoys, but after the battlecruiser suffered a serious mechanical accident the next day, the Germans were forced to break off the operation. Ramillies and the rest of the Grand Fleet sortied on 24 April once they intercepted wireless signals from the damaged Moltke, but the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. On 21 November 1918, following the Armistice, the entire Grand Fleet left port to escort the surrendered German fleet into internment at Scapa Flow. =Interwar years= Ramillies, probably in the late 1910s or 1920s Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Ramillies typically operated with her sister ships, apart from periods where they were detached for refit or modernisation. Grant was relieved by Captain John Luce on 1 February 1919. In April the ships were transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, still as part of the 1st Battle Squadron. They were then attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1920 for operations in Turkey and the Black Sea as part of Britain's responses to the Greco-Turkish War and the Russian Civil War, respectively. On 16 March Ramillies and her sisters , , and landed parties of Royal Marines and sailors to assist the British Army in occupying Constantinople. Early the following month, Ramillies and Revenge were sent to Georgia to monitor the situation as Bolshevik troops approached that country. Luce was relieved in his turn by Captain Aubrey Smith on 9 April. In mid-June Ramillies and Revenge bombarded Turkish Nationalist forces advancing on Ismid, with the former expending 46 fifteen-inch shells and 657 shells from her six-inch guns. The sisters also off-loaded Royal Marine landing parties to reinforce the 242nd Infantry Brigade defending the city. They were supported by seaplanes from and . Sailors from Ramillies boarded the battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim and prepared her to be towed away from Ismid. Ramillies, Revenge and Royal Sovereign covered the landings in Eastern Thrace at the beginning of the Greek Summer Offensive. The ships returned to the Atlantic Fleet in August. The 1st and 2nd Battle Squadrons merged in May 1921, with the Ramillies and her four sisters forming the 1st Division and the five Queen Elizabeth-class battleships forming the 2nd Division. Captain Francis Mitchell assumed command of the ship on 19 August. Ramillies and three of her sisters were again sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1922 during the crisis in Smyrna that culminated in the Great Fire of Smyrna as the Greco-Turkish War came to its conclusion. The ships primarily operated in the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora. With the war over by November, the ships were free to return once again to the Atlantic Fleet. Captain Wilfrid Nunn relieved Mitchell on 20 April 1924 before Ramillies underwent a refit at Rosyth in June. On 1 November, the Atlantic Fleet underwent a reorganisation that saw the Queen Elizabeth-class ships sent to the Mediterranean Fleet and the ships of the 1st Division reconstituted as the 1st Battle Squadron. She decommissioned for an extensive refit at Devonport in September 1926 which concluded on 1 March 1927, when she recommissioned for service. Ramillies and her sisters were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in August. Captain Hubert Monroe was appointed in command of the ship on 3 February 1928. In August and September, Ramillies participated in torpedo and anti-submarine exercises. She took part in manoeuvres simulating a surprise attack in January 1929 and then in combined exercises with the Atlantic Fleet two months later. Captain Bernard Fairbairn replaced Monroe in late April. She went to Jaffa in Mandatory Palestine in October during a period of unrest in the city. Ramillies briefly ran aground in Malta's Grand Harbour in January 1930. She steamed to Alexandria in September 1930 in response to rioting there. The ship paid off in June 1932 for another extensive refit at Devonport that lasted until August 1934. In early 1935, the Revenge and Queen Elizabeth classes again swapped places, though by this time, the Atlantic Fleet had been renamed the Home Fleet. On 16 July, the ships were present during the fleet review at Spithead for King George V's silver jubilee. Ramillies accidentally collided with the German steamship in a gale in the Strait of Dover on 31 August; her bow was slightly damaged in the incident. Beginning in 1936, she served as a training ship for Royal Naval Reserve and ship's boys, a role she filled until December 1937. During this period, she and her sisters were present for the Coronation Review for George VI on 20 May 1937. Captain Edward Syfret was appointed in command on 10 January 1938. Starting in July, the ship had another refit at Devonport that lasted until February 1939. Captain Harold Baillie-Grohman assumed command on 28 September 1938. Admiral Sir Martin Dunbar-Nasmith inspected the ship's company on 16 February. After recommissioning on 22 February, she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, though this stint was short-lived. The ship was transferred back to the Home Fleet in July for use as a training ship. On 9 August, she was present during a fleet review for the King at Portland. Following its conclusion, she was sent to Alexandria, Egypt by way of Gibraltar, remaining there until October, by which time the Second World War had broken out in Europe. =Second World War= Ramillies in Greenock at some point during the Second World War In the Atlantic and Mediterranean On 5 October 1939 Ramillies was ordered to leave Alexandria to join the North Atlantic Escort Force based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The following day, the order was rescinded, and she was instead recalled to Alexandria to replace the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet. In November, she was transferred to Aden as part of the search effort for the German commerce-raiding heavy cruiser . Ramillies made port visits in Australia en route to New Zealand, arriving in Wellington on 31 December, to rendezvous with the convoy transporting elements of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force to Egypt. She was the first battleship to visit the country and Baillie- Grohman was presented with a MƒÅori piupiu (a warrior's skirt made from rolled flax) by the head of the NgƒÅti Poneke. The gift followed a tradition established in 1913 by the battlecruiser , as the piupiu was intended to ward harm from the ship's company provided that it was worn while the ship was in danger. Ramillies escorted the convoy to Australia where it was reinforced by ships carrying units of the Second Australian Imperial Force and then to Aden where the battleship left them to return to Australia to pick up another troop convoy for the Middle East. Admiral Graf Spee never entered the Indian Ocean, so Ramillies was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet in May 1940 as the probability of Italy joining the war on the German side began to rise. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June, the British fleet began operations against Italian positions throughout the Mediterranean. By late June, Ramillies was occupied with escorting convoys in the Mediterranean in company with Royal Sovereign and the aircraft carrier . In early July, after France had surrendered to Germany and while Britain sought to neutralise the French battleships in the Mediterranean lest they be seized by Germany and Italy, Baillie-Grohman negotiated with the commander of the battleship in Alexandria to demilitarise his ship by unloading fuel and removing the breechblocks from his guns. On 15 August, Ramillies shelled the Italian port of Bardia and Fort Capuzzo outside Sollum alongside the battleships Malaya and and the heavy cruiser . Italian bombers attempted to strike the British fleet, but they failed to score any hits; heavy anti-aircraft fire and fighters from Eagle shot down twelve Italian aircraft. The ships escorted a convoy to Malta from 8 to 14 October; poor weather hampered Italian reconnaissance efforts and the convoy reached Malta without incident. Captain Arthur Read relieved Baillie-Grohman on 27 October. The ship was part of the force that covered a series of convoys to and from Malta and Greece in early November during which Ramillies was unsuccessfully attacked by the as she approached Grand Harbour. The battleship then escorted the aircraft carrier when she struck the main Italian naval base at Taranto on the night of 11 November, inflicting serious damage on the Italian battle fleet. As a result of the raid on Taranto and the crippling of much of the Italian battleship fleet, Ramillies was no longer necessary to counter the strength of the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy), and so she was reallocated to the North Atlantic Escort Force. Later, on 27 November, she was attached to Force H to escort a Malta convoy during the Battle of Cape Spartivento, though she did not see action herself. In December, she returned to Devonport for a refit, escorting a convoy from Gibraltar to Greenock, Scotland, that lasted from 17 December to 6 January 1941. On 12 January, Ramillies got underway to join the escort for a convoy out of Halifax bound for the Middle East. She continued convoy operations in the North Atlantic through August, and during this period, she escorted Convoy HX 106 which encountered the German fast battleships and on 8 February. The lightly-armed German battleships, equipped with guns, and under orders to avoid conflict with enemy capital ships, did not attack the convoy when they realised Ramillies was among the escort vessels. On 23 May, Ramillies was detached from escort duties for Convoy HX 127 to join the search for the German battleship , though she did not encounter the vessel. Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited the ship on 16 August in Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, whilst returning from a conference in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, Canada, with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt where they had signed the Atlantic Charter. Upon her return to the UK, Ramillies began a lengthy refit in Liverpool that lasted until 20 November. With the Eastern Fleet In October 1941 the Admiralty decided the ship was to be transferred to the 3rd Battle Squadron which was to be based in Colombo, Ceylon; she was joined there by her three surviving sisters. The squadron was established in December and was attached to Force F. With the start of the Pacific War on 7 December, naval forces were necessary in the Indian Ocean to protect British India. By the end of March 1942, the Eastern Fleet had been formed, under the command of Admiral James Somerville. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern Fleet, many of its units, including the four Revenge-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice-Admiral Ch≈´ichi Nagumo's powerful Kido Butai, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville's Eastern Fleet. As a result, only the modernised Warspite could operate with the two fleet carriers; Ramillies, her three sisters, and Hermes were kept away from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean. Ramillies approaching the entrance to Diego-Suarez harbour, May 1942 In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, a branch of Bletchley Park, informed Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Ramillies and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet in a night action, the only method by which he thought he could achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll, in the Maldives, to refuel. While there, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April. Following the first raid on 5 April, Somerville withdrew Ramillies and her three sisters to Mombasa, Kenya, where they could secure the shipping routes in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The four Revenges departed from Addu Atoll early on the morning on 9 April, bound for Mombasa; they remained based there into 1943. Syfret returned to Ramillies in late April as a rear admiral, commander of the covering force for the invasion of Madagascar (Operation Ironclad). The ship provided a landing party of 50 Royal Marines that were ferried by the destroyer at high speed past the coast defences of Diego Suarez on the northern end of Madagascar in the dark on 6 May. Disembarking in the harbour, they captured the French artillery command post along with its barracks and the naval depot. The following day the battleship engaged the coastal batteries on Oronjia Peninsula, but after enduring a few salvos of 15-inch shells, the French gunners decided to cease firing. Ramillies remained there during the Battle of Madagascar until the French garrison surrendered in November. On 30 May, Japanese midget submarines that had been launched by the submarines and attacked the ships in Diego Suarez. One of the midget submarines scored a hit on Ramillies just forward of her \\"A\\" turret on the port side. The explosion tore a large hole in the hull and caused extensive flooding, though damage control teams quickly contained it and prompt counter-flooding prevented her from listing badly. Still down by the bow after offloading most of her ammunition, she was nevertheless able to steam to Durban, South Africa, at a speed of . There, she was inspected by the Constructor H. S. Pengelly, who noted that \\"although the vessel is now 26 years old and felt by most to be of little value owing to reduced size and slow speeds, the Ramillies is in exceptionally good shape, and I should wonder whether or not the capital ships of today with their lighter scantlings would survive a blow as well as this old girl, some 26 years after they were built.\\" The ship underwent temporary repairs in Durban from June to August before getting underway for Devonport, where permanent repairs were effected. She returned to service in June 1943, and in July, arrived in Kilindini in East Africa, where she rejoined the Eastern Fleet; by that time, she was the only battleship remaining on the station. Captain Gervase Middleton assumed command on 23 August. She left on 28 December, bound for Britain, where she was refitted for her new role as a coastal bombardment vessel. After arriving in January 1944, she was assigned to the Home Fleet. Operations Overlord and Dragoon Ramillies bombarding German positions in Normandy, 6 June 1944 After her refit in early 1944 to augment her anti-aircraft defences was completed, Ramillies was assigned to Bombardment Force D, supporting the invasion fleet during the Normandy landings in June. In company with Warspite, the monitor , five cruisers and fifteen destroyers, the bombardment force operated to the east of Sword Beach, supporting Assault Force S. After assembling in the Clyde area, the force joined the main invasion fleet on the morning of 6 June off the French coast. The two battleships opened fire at around 05:30, Ramillies targeting the German battery at Benerville-sur-Mer. Shortly afterwards, three German torpedo boats sortied from Le Havre to attack the bombardment group. Although engaged by both Ramillies and Warspite as well as the cruisers, the German vessels were able to escape after launching fifteen torpedoes at long range. Two torpedoes passed between Warspite and Ramillies, and only one vessel, the Norwegian-manned destroyer , was struck and sunk. The battleships resumed shelling the coastal batteries for the rest of the day, suppressing the heavy German guns, which allowed cruisers and destroyers to move closer in to provide direct fire support to the advancing troops. Ramillies carried out eleven shoots against Bennerville battery with considerable observed success, to the extent that the battery showed no sign of life in the afternoon. As a result, the planned commando landing to neutralise it (Operations Frog and Deer) were cancelled. The pair of battleships returned to their station the next day, this time in company with the battleship . Over the course of the next week, the battleships‚Äîwith Rodney alternating with her sister ‚Äîcontinually bombarded German defences facing the British and Canadian invasion beaches at Sword, Gold, and Juno beaches. Over the course of her bombardment duties off the Normandy coast, Ramillies fired 1,002shells from her main battery. Her worn-out guns had to be replaced afterwards at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth. In July, Ramillies was transferred to the Mediterranean as forces were assembled for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France that was to take place the following month. Ramillies was one of five battleships to support the landings, namely the American battleships , and , and the Free French Lorraine. Owing to her late arrival in the Mediterranean she did not join Gunfire Support Group Alpha in Malta, instead she sailed direct from Algiers to rendezvous with the group off the French coast early on 15 August. Ramillies carried out bombardments between 15 and 28 August. On D-Day itself, Gunfire Support Group Alpha primarily engaged coastal batteries guarding landing sector Alpha, around the Gulf of St. Tropez. Ramillies fired ten rounds at the heavy battery south of St. Tropez at 06:15 and twenty-four rounds at the battery near Cape Camarat at 06:54. Thereafter there was little need for further support as the invading infantry moved quickly inland. On 17 August, Ramillies moved to the Sitka sector and bombarded German positions on the island of Port-Cros. Guided by a spotter aircraft flying from , she scored six direct hits on the town's fort. The ground forces fought their way west towards Toulon. Supporting fire from the bombardment force assisted French forces who captured half of the city, but batteries on the St. Mandrier Peninsula continued to hold out. It was decided that a determined effort would be made to destroy or capture the forts on 25 August and the day before, Ramillies, who had been ordered to Algiers, received orders to return to the assault area. Arriving off Porquerolles at 14:00 on 25 August, she joined Lorraine and a number of cruisers. Confusion initially reigned and Ramillies did not open fire until 16:40, firing sixteen rounds before her targets were obscured by smoke. Recommencing fire at 18:38, she fired a further forty-six rounds, scoring several hits and silencing two batteries. Several batteries continued to hold out however, and on 26 August, the bombardment continued. Ramillies fired thirty-five rounds, scoring direct hits and observing no retaliatory fire. On 27 August she fired forty-eight more rounds, of which at least thirty-four fell within 50 yards of her target batteries. The German gun crews surrendered the following day. Ramillies was finally released from the assault area on 29 August. Fate A gun of HMS Ramillies (the near one) on display in front of the Imperial War Museum On 31 January 1945, her bombardment ability no longer required, Ramillies was reduced to reserve at Portsmouth. She was partially disarmed and converted into a barracks ship on 15 May, after the German surrender. The ship was attached to the training establishment , where she was known as Vernon III. In December 1947, the worn- out battleship was placed on the disposal list and she was transferred to the British Iron & Steel Corporation on 2 February 1948 to be sold for scrap. She was taken to Cairnryan on 23 April and subsequently broken up. One of Ramillies 15-inch guns has been preserved and can be seen outside the Imperial War Museum in London. The gun was mounted aboard the ship in 1916 and remained in place until 1941, when it was removed and placed in storage. The gun was used in the actions around Bardia and at Cape Spartivento. It was installed in its current location in 1968, along with a gun from Roberts. The Beardmore Sculpture was created by Tom McKendrick to commemorate the employees of the long-closed Beardmore Shipyard in Dalmuir. Unveiled on 9 September 2010, the artist chose to crown the sculpture with a model of Ramillies.

In January 2019, it was nominated for the Best Live Action Short Film at the 91st Academy Awards. Denise Fergus, the mother of James Bulger, stated that she was \\"disgusted and upset\\" by the film and its subsequent nomination because the film was made without contacting her family. She had previously circulated a petition to have it removed from Oscar consideration, which drew more than 227,000 signatures by 29 January 2019, and wrote to the film's director Vincent Lambe to withdraw it from the Oscars. Lambe said that he would not be doing so, saying \\"It's like saying we should burn every copy of it. I think it would defeat the purpose of making the film.\\" The film currently has an 83% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews, and an average rating of 7.83/10.

It, along with \\"Bog Queen\\", \\"The Grauballe Man\\", \\"Strange Fruit\\" and \\"The Tollund Man\\", is inspired by P.V. Glob's book, The Bog People.\\"Punishment\\" highlights similarities between Europe's ancient past and The Troubles in Northern Ireland.  Inspiration  The inspiration for the bog-body poems came after Heaney read the book The Bog People by P.V. Glob, a 1965 archeological study of bodies that were preserved in the bogs of Northern Europe. He published the first such poem, \\"The Tollund Man\\", in his 1972 collection Wintering Out. Heaney elaborated on this inspiration in his essay \\"Feeling Into Words\\", stating that \\"the unforgettable photographs of these victims blended in my mind with photographs of atrocities, past and present, in the long rites of Irish political and religious struggles\\".  Analysis  The poem is made up of eleven stanzas with four lines each. The first two stanzas consist of Heaney describing how he imagines the woman might have looked just prior to her execution for adultery. He then describes what the body looks like now, after preservation in the bog. The final six stanzas explore the speaker's voyeuristic relationship with the condemned and laments that, although they \\"would connive/ in civilized outrage\\", they would \\"understand the exact/ and tribal, intimate revenge.\\" Mary P. Brown, a lecturer at the New University of Ulster, found Heaney's conflicted emotions to represent an indictment of art itself, writing that, \\"Heaney's self accusation in the last four stanzas of the poem is directed at both the man and the poet. The poem has been bought at the expense of action: art stands accused.\\" Stephanie Alexander recognizes a theme of violence and complicity that remains constant across time, writing that, \\"the bog has become an uncanny reflection of contemporary life, an archive that houses both the past and present, and the narrator seems helpless but to do anything but reenact the violence again\\". Some critics responded negatively to this association between past and present violence. Ciaran Carson accused Heaney of becoming \\"the laureate of violence--a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing, an apologist for 'the situation,' in the last resort, a mystifier\\".Ciaran Carson. \\"Escaped from the Massacre?\\" The Honest Ulsterman 50 (Winter 1975)  The Troubles  The lines, \\"I who have stood dumb/ when your betraying sisters,/ cauled in tar,/ wept by the railings,\\" draw a connection between the past and the conflict in Northern Ireland contemporary to when the poem was written. During the Troubles, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was known to have used tarring and feathering as a way to punish Irish women who were involved with British soldiers.

During the night of 20‚Äì21 June, police searching a property in Orelia found his body. Two women‚Äî25-year-old Jemma Victoria Lilley and 42-year-old Trudi Clare Lenon‚Äîwere arrested and charged with murder. On 1 November 2017, Lilley and Lenon were convicted of the murder of Pajich by the Supreme Court of Western Australia, and on 28 February 2018, they were sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.  Background  Jemma Lilley, originally from Stamford, Lincolnshire, England, was reported to have developed a fascination with violence and serial killers at a young age. Following domestic abuse by her mother, Lilley's parents separated, with Lilley's father gaining custody of Lilley and her sibling. Diagnosed with dyslexia and autism at age 6, Lilley watched films about serial killers, dressed up as them and collected butcher knives as hobbies. At the age of 15, she began writing a novel titled Playzone whose protagonist was a serial killer nicknamed \\"SOS\\" (named after the real-life serial killer David Berkowitz, who is also known as the \\"Son of Sam\\"). She later published the book online under the pen name \\"Syn Demon\\". In 2010, aged 18, Lilley moved to Perth, where she worked at a tattoo parlour and at a Woolworths supermarket. In 2012, she married Gordon Galbraith, a gay man, in order to obtain permanent residency. Galbraith died in August 2014. In 2016, she met and befriended Trudi Lenon, who had been a friend of Galbraith's best friend. Lenon frequently practiced BDSM as a submissive, and she and Lilley forged a dominant‚Äîsubmissive friendship. In May 2016, Lenon moved into Lilley's house‚Äîwhich they called \\"Elm Street\\"‚Äîin Orelia. In virtual conversations with each other, Lenon called Lilley \\"SOS\\" while Lilley called Lenon \\"Corvina\\", the alias Lenon used on the BDSM scene. In an online conversation on 31 May, Lilley and Lenon told each other they were \\"ready\\" to commit a killing. Between 16 May and 12 June, Lilley and Lenon made three shopping trips together, buying items such as a circular saw, acetone, bleach, a barrel and of hydrochloric acid.  Disappearance and body discovery  On the morning of Monday, 13 June 2016, Aaron Pajich, an 18-year-old man with autism spectrum disorder, was driven from the house he was lodging at in Waikiki to Rockingham Centre by his landlady; he was reported missing two days later after failing to return to the house. Investigators discovered that the last answered phone call made to his mobile phone was made on 13 June from Lenon's phone, and footage recorded by a closed-circuit television camera at Rockingham Centre that day showed Lenon driving her car out of the carpark with Lilley and Pajich inside. Also, a camera outside the women's house in Orelia had captured Pajich entering the house along with the women later that morning. On the night of 20 June, police went to the house to search for Pajich, and after digging up concrete tiles in the back yard, they found his body buried in a grave. A post-mortem examination established that he had suffered stab wounds to his neck and chest which severed a jugular vein and punctured his liver and lungs. There were also marks on his neck consistent with an attempt to strangle him with a garrote, and there were defense wounds on his hands.  Trial and sentence  After being arrested, Lilley and Lenon were charged with murder on 22 June 2016. Both pleaded not guilty at Stirling Gardens Magistrates Court on 26 October. Their trial began on 2 October 2017 at the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The court heard that Lenon telephoned Pajich on the morning of 13 June 2016 and invited him to visit her at the house that she and Lilley shared. Lenon offered to pick Pajich up at Rockingham Centre, and Pajich's landlady, who overheard the call, dropped him off there. Later that morning, the CCTV camera that had been installed outside Lilley and Lenon's house captured Lenon entering the house holding a knife. The prosecution testified that Pajich was choked with a garrote by Lilley, who then stabbed him while Lenon helped her pin him down. Lilley was said to have wanted to kill a person to \\"tick murder off her bucket list\\" by the age of 25. One of Lilley's Woolworths co-workers told the court that, five days after Pajich went missing, Lilley told him that she and Lenon had killed Pajich. In an interview with police, Lenon admitted that she invited Pajich to the house, but said she did not think he would be killed. Lenon said that she witnessed Lilley choking Pajich with a garrote, which then broke, and pinning him down while holding a knife. Lenon admitted to helping Lilley hide the evidence. Lilley denied any involvement in Pajich's death, saying that she last saw him sitting in her living room and then went into a bedroom, where she fell asleep. When questioned about the content of their virtual conversations and lists of methods of torture and items used for torture that were found in their house, Lilley and Lenon said that they were drafting scenes to be included in books they were writing. On 1 November 2017, Lilley and Lenon were convicted of the murder of Pajich, following a two-hour deliberation by the jury. On 28 February 2018, they were both sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 28 years. Justice Stephen Hall described the murder as \\"morally repugnant\\", saying the women killed Pajich for \\"[their] own pleasure\\" and the \\"pitiless pursuit of [their] own desires\\". Lilley appealed her conviction on 10 April 2019. The appeal court rejected her appeal on 22 October.  Aftermath  Two months after the conviction, on 1 January 2018, Lenon suffered burns to 21% of her body when a fellow inmate, Nyiltjiri Naalina Forrest, doused her with of boiling water while Lenon was waiting to receive medication. Forrest pleaded guilty to causing bodily harm, claiming to have been \\"disgusted\\" by Lenon's crime, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Boxer Danny Green praised the attack on Lenon on Facebook, writing: \\"My hat is off to whoever carried out this act. I'm tired of our putrid constitution forcing the law into the hands of the community. This poor young man. The way his life ended was just incomprehensible. I hope you get an infection and die a horrid and slow and obscenely painful death you foul mutt.\\" In December 2018, it was reported that Lilley was in a romantic relationship with inmate Melony Attwood, a fellow female convicted murderer. Both Lilley and Attwood were later moved to different prisons.

She was a highly regarded massage therapist and massage therapy instructor. She worked to develop massage into a respected trade and raise the massage profession to align with health care in the United States. She continued working until she died at the age of 90.  Biography Irene (Simonen) Gauthier was born to Finnish immigrants in Pelkie, Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. After High School, she moved to attended beauty school Detroit in 1938. She became licensed as a cosmetologist by the state of Michigan in 1939. By 1947 she owned her own beauty parlor on Six Mile in Detroit. After an asthma attack two years later she started learning about natural healing techniques. In 1957, she began to formally study Swedish massage at the Steam Baths on Grand River Avenue in Detroit. Gauthier began practicing foot reflexology massage on her cosmetology clients as they sat under the hairdryer. After obtaining a portable massage table she made house visits to practice massage. She closed her beauty parlor and combined her cosmetology career with massage therapy in her own basement. Ten years into her career, in 1968, Irene won the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) Member of the Year Award. Two years later she helped found both the International Myomassethics Federation and the Michigan Myomassologist Association . Irene continued as a student throughout life. In 1975 she studied under the Touch for Health Foundation in Pasadena, California and became a Touch for Health instructor in 1976. In 1981 she received a certificate in Polarity Therapy from Dr. Said. She also studied basic, intermediate, and advanced Craniosacral therapy from Dr. John Upledger of the Upledger Institute in Palm Springs, Florida. Her first four students learned massage in Irene's basement. Classes successfully continued there until 1987 when she opened her first state-licensed school, The Myomassethics Center. Two years later, in 1989, Irene wrote the book, \\"The Science and Practice of Myomassology\\". The book was added to the curriculum and is still in use at her institute. Her massage therapy techniques were filmed in 1999 making a companion video to her textbook. Irene's Myomassology Institute, named after Irene herself, opened in 1993 with her daughter Kathleen. The original location was expanded four times but ultimately became too small as the school's success continued. In May 2000, construction of a new building for Irene's campus began. In 2002 the 17,000 square foot facility had its grand opening. At the age of 82, Irene continued to teach students at the institute. Through her work there, and at various workshops around the world she was able to help create a better understanding of health through massage therapy and holistic health practices. She received multiple awards including a Certificate of Tribute from then Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and a Certificate of Tribute from then Mayor of Southfield Brenda Lawrence in 2009, and a joint resolution for her many contributions both locally and globally on June 18, 2010, from the Mayor of Southfield and the City Council. Celebrating her 90th birthday, Irene's staff held an event to break the world record for longest massage chain ever. Although this goal was accomplished with 1108 participants, the record was soon thereafter claimed by an energy drink company in Thailand. Through most of that year, Irene continued to work at her school as both a massage instructor and a massage therapist. She was often found assisting with clients as a supervisor in the shool's student massage clinic. Later that year, on October 25th, she died of congestive heart failure. In 2012, Irene Gauthier was inducted into the Massage Therapy Hall of Fame in recognition of her contributions to the art and science of massage therapy at the World Massage Festival. The school Irene had founded also won the Best of Detroit award from Hour Detroit. The following year it went on to win Massage School of the Year.

She attended the University of Oklahoma, where she obtained her Master's degree in 1930. After graduating, Maria became a district geologist during the second World War. She worked in several locations throughout her career, such as Dallas, Oklahoma, California, Calgary, Amarillo, and Los Angeles, but most of her work was based out of Midland, Texas. In Midland, Spencer was a part of the Midland One project, which was a well sitting job and doing tests on wildcat wells. From there, she moved to work on Andros in the Bahamas, where she developed the Bahamas Deep Test, which focused mostly on strati-graphic testing. Bahamas Deep Test On April 13, 1946, Maria Spencer traveled to the Bahamas to begin her work in Andros, conducting strati-graphic testing on the land. This testing was done at a location off of the eastern shore, approximately 7 miles inland. This location was picked specifically due to the lack of influence from the talus deposits that were built out from the reef, as well as minimal movement from the reef front‚Äôs tectonic waves. This included possible slumping of the land and movement in the layers of the earth. In other words, it was the most stable place to do the testing. It was noted that this location was also chosen because it allowed a complete penetration, which allowed for uncomplicated data extraction. This location yielded inconclusive geological and geophysical data at the time of its selection. The testing continued until April 1, 1947, almost a year after the start date, reaching a depth of 14,585 ft. From this analysis, gas and oil were not found in a sufficient form. This experimental discovery paved the way for new understandings of late Cretaceous period strata. Because the depth reached was insufficient to analyze early Cretaceous strata, Maria compared it to that of strata samples taken southern Florida. It was concluded that the Cretaceous strata in Andros No. 1 consisted of small traces of anhydrite, as well as crystalline dolomite and dolomite limestone. In southern Florida, the composition of strata was anhydrite, with interbred dolomite and fossiliferous chalky limestone. One of the major differences in the strata samples from each location was the difference in the porousness of each layer. It was observed that there were minor signs of poorly developed porosity in the Florida sample, while the sample collected in Andros No. 1 showed large, thick areas of well-developed porosity. This information allowed geologists to conclude that at approximately 14,500 ft., the well in Andros no. 1 would have reached the Early Cretaceous strata.

She is the inaugural ship for the cruise line and was delivered on 14 February 2020 by Fincantieri of Italy. She is set to debut on 16 October 2020. She will operate exclusively as an \\"adults-only\\" ship for guests aged 18 and over, sailing mainly four-to-five-night Caribbean itineraries from Miami, Florida.  Construction and career  = Planning = On 4 December 2014, founder of Virgin Group, Richard Branson, announced that Virgin Group was forming Virgin Cruises, together with the backing of Bain Capital, and revealed plans to build two new cruise ships. On 23 June 2015, Virgin Cruises announced that it signed a letter of intent with Italian shipbuilder, Fincantieri, for three cruise ships that could each accommodate approximately 2,800 guests and 1,150 crew for seven-day Caribbean voyages. The three-ship order reportedly cost US$2.55 billion, with the first ship scheduled to begin operating in 2020. The order's contract for the ships was formally signed on 18 October 2016, the same day Virgin Cruises rebranded as Virgin Voyages. On 20 July 2018, Virgin Voyages revealed the name of the first ship as Scarlet Lady, in honor of sister brand, Virgin Atlantic's, second plane. = Construction and delivery = Temporarily billed as Virgin I and known in the shipyard as \\"hull number 6287,\\" the first ship for Virgin Voyages began construction with the steel- cutting ceremony at Fincantieri's shipyard in Sestri Ponente near Genoa on 22 March 2017. On 31 October 2017, the ship's keel-laying and coin ceremonies were held. On 20 July 2018, the dock was flooded for the first time to allow two hull sections to be connected. The ship was assembled from 399 sections. On 8 February 2019, Scarlet Lady was floated out from the shipyard, accompanied by an ceremony in which a bottle of champagne was triggered to strike the hull. Interior outfitting work began upon her float out. Scarlet Lady performed two rounds of sea trials in November 2019. She set off from Genoa to Marseille between 15 November and 18 November and sailed in the reverse direction for her second round between 27 November and 30 November. Scarlet Lady was completed and presented by Fincantieri on 13 February 2020 and formally delivered to Virgin Voyages on 14 February 2020 in Sestri Ponente. She was scheduled to be christened in Miami on 19 March 2020, but the christening has been postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. = Debut = The ship's debut and inaugural festivities were all impacted by the pandemic and the cruise line's subsequent suspension of operations. Scarlet Lady began by hosting media and travel industry representatives on stops in Dover and Liverpool before continuing her re-positioning voyage to North America. Virgin Voyages had prepared preview events in New York City, but cancelled them due to the pandemic, so the ship continued her re-positioning to Miami instead. Upon her arrival in Miami, Scarlet Lady was scheduled to perform two pre- inaugural voyages in late-March 2020. Her first was scheduled from 26 to 29 March and her second from 29 March to 1 April. Both three-night sailings would embark from Miami and visit Virgin Voyages' new private island resort, The Beach Club at Bimini, located on the Bimini islands in the Bahamas. On 12 March 2020, Virgin Voyages had announced an initial postponement of the ship's inaugural season, with the pre-inaugural sailings slated to begin on 15 July 2020. However, these were cancelled in May 2020. Scarlet Lady was originally scheduled to sail her maiden voyage on 1 April 2020, visiting Key West and \\"The Beach Club\\" at Bimini, which was initially postponed in March 2020 to 7 August 2020. In May 2020, the cruise line announced that the ship will not begin sailing until 16 October 2020. = Deployments = On 23 June 2015, Branson initially announced the first three ships in the fleet would be based at PortMiami for week-long, round-trip Caribbean itineraries, with the first ship beginning operations in 2020. In January 2019, Virgin Voyages released details of Scarlet Lady's itineraries, with revisions from earlier plans. She was now scheduled to sail shorter itineraries, performing four-to-five-night round-trip Caribbean cruises to either: Havana, Cuba, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, or Costa Maya, Mexico. All voyages would include a stop at The Beach Club at Bimini. In June 2019, in response to the United States' government ban on passengers from entering Cuba via passenger and recreational vessels, Virgin Voyages swapped out all visits to Havana with calls to Key West, Florida. It also added a fourth itinerary option to visit Cozumel, Mexico on five-night sailings, and added two seven-night holiday sailings to Puerto Plata and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All voyages will retain their visits to The Beach Club at Bimini. Scarlet Lady's deployment schedule is expected to continue through 2021.  Design and concept  = Adults-only = On 31 October 2017, Branson and president and CEO of Virgin Voyages, Tom McAlpin, revealed that the company's first ship would be exclusive to adults, requiring that all guests be ages 18 and over. McAlpin explained that this move was made to appeal largely to travel professionals within the more premium market looking for an \\"elevated\\" experience. Chief Commercial Officer of Virgin Voyages, Nirmal Saverimuttu, also attributed the decision to the company's aim to target \\"people who would not typically consider a cruise holiday\\" and might be interested in a \\"cooler\\" and more \\"intimate\\" setting. = Offerings = On Scarlet Lady, Virgin Voyages bundles all passengers' fares as one price per cabin, as opposed to pricing each voyage per guest. Consequently, prices appear higher than those of Virgin's competitors. Virgin explained that all fares would cover dining charges, fitness classes, internet access, and gratuities, among other offerings, but expenses incurred from alcoholic beverages, retail, and shore excursions would be charged separately. The ship does not include any buffet or dining rooms, and instead, houses approximately 20 different dining and drinking establishments. Other venues include a multi- function theater and an onboard tattoo and body piercing parlor. = Technology and specifications = lifeboat tender on Scarlet Lady Scarlet Lady has a total of 1,408 passenger cabins and 813 crew cabins for a maximum capacity of 4,400 passengers and crew, which can accommodate over 2,770 passengers and 1,160 crew. Of the 1,408 passenger cabins, there are 78 suites, 1,030 balcony cabins, 95 window cabins, and 105 inside cabins. She is equipped with balconies on 86% of her cabins, with 93% of the cabins featuring an outside view. The ship's livery consists of a silver hull, red funnel, and tinted windows, and also includes the Virgin \\"mermaid guide\\" figure featured on sister brands, Virgin Atlantic and Virgin America. Scarlet Lady has 17 decks, a length of , a draft of , and a beam of . She is powered by a diesel- electric genset system, with four W√§rtsil√§ engines, producing . Main propulsion is via two propellers, each driven by a electric motor. The system gives the vessel a service speed of and a maximum speed of . W√§rtsil√§ also provided the ship's navigation systems, a hybrid scrubber system to remove sulfur dioxide from the exhaust, and a selective catalytic reduction system to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The ship partially produces her own energy through a production system that uses the waste heat from her diesel engines.  Incidents and accidents  = 2020 crew member death = On 22 May 2020, it was reported that a 32-year-old male Filipino crew member of Scarlet Lady had been found dead in his cabin. Virgin Voyages confirmed the man's death was not related to the coronavirus, and the United States Coast Guard confirmed that he had died from \\"apparent self-harm.\\" Scarlet Lady sailed into PortMiami later that day, where the body was disembarked.

Jones (August 25, 1786 ‚Äì September 3, 1858) was an American general who was prominent in New York life in the 1800s. Early life Jones was born on August 25, 1786 in New York. He was the third son of John Jones (1755‚Äì1806) and Eleanor (n√©e Colford) Jones (1755‚Äì1824), who were both of English descent. His elder brother, John Jones Jr., died without issue, and his younger sister, Sarah Jones, was married to Peter Schermerhorn (the uncle to James' eventual wife). James' cousin, Edward Renshaw Jones (the son of merchant Joshua Jones), was married to Elizabeth Schermerhorn (the aunt to James' eventual wife of the same name), and was the grandfather of Edith (n√©e Jones) Wharton and Frederic Rhinelander Jones. Career Jones \\"took an active and efficient interest in the military establishment of New York, in which he held the rank of major general of the third division of infantry.\\" He was previously a Brigadier general with the 59th Brigade of Infantry. He also served as a trustee of the savings bank, the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company, the New York Hospital and was a vestryman of Trinity Church. He was an ally of Philip Hone (the mayor of New York City from 1826 to 1827 today best known for his extensive diary) in the creation of Washington Square Park. =Jones's Wood= After his father's death in 1806, the family farm, known as Jones's Wood, was divided into lots among his Jones and his siblings, with James retaining the main house and its lot. James' sister Sarah, who had married the shipowner and merchant Peter Schermerhorn, received the parcel nearest to the city where the Schermerhorns first inhabited a modest villa overlooking the river at the foot of today's 67th Street. James and Peter controlled land beyond their shares as trustees for other family members. Later in life, Jones led the opposition to using his family's lands for the city's main park, thereby \\"paving the way for the creation of today's Central Park\\". Personal life In 1838, Jones was married to Elizabeth Schermerhorn (1817‚Äì1874), the daughter of Abraham Schermerhorn and Helen Van Courtlandt (n√©e White) Schermerhorn. Elizabeth's younger sister was Caroline Schermerhorn (also known as the \\"Mrs. Astor\\"), who married William Backhouse Astor Jr. of the Astor family. Together, they resided at 5 Washington Place, located at the northeast corner of Washington Place and Mercer Street in New York City, which Jones built in 1842 and which became a \\"center of society comparable to Mary Mason Jones's home nearby on Broadway\\". James and Elizabeth were the parents of: * Eleanor Colford Jones (1841‚Äì1906), who was married to Augustus Newbold Morris (1838‚Äì1906), a descendant of Declaration of Independence signor Lewis Morris, and who was a manager of the Home for Incurables at Fordham, a director of the Zoological Society, and a vice-president of the Plaza Bank. * James Henry Jones (1846‚Äì1919), who graduated from West Point in 1868 and who did not marry. * Cordelia Schermerhorn Jones (1849‚Äì1920), who married John Steward Jr. (1847‚Äì1943). In 1839, Jones was sculpted by Thomas Crawford, who is today best known for his numerous contributions to the United States Capitol. His wife's portrait was painted by Irish portrait painter Charles C. Ingham. Jones died on September 3, 1858 in Basel, Switzerland. His widow Elizabeth died in Lenox, Massachusetts in August 1874 and was buried alongside her husband in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. =Descendants= Through his daughter Eleanor, he was the grandfather of Eleanor Colford Morris (1863‚Äì1863), who died young; Augustus Newbold Morris (1868‚Äì1928) who married Helen Schermerhorn Kingsland (granddaughter of New York City Mayor Ambrose Kingsland); Eva Van Cortlandt Morris (1869‚Äì1947), who married Emile McDougall Hawkes William Henry Morris (1871‚Äì1871), who also died young; and Lewis Morris (1873‚Äì1875), who also died young.

The blast killed 16 people and injured another 30.  History  The disaster took place at the Lariat Cafe in the town of Monticello, Utah. At the time, the town was undergoing a massive construction boom caused by the discovery of lucrative uranium deposits in the nearby mountains; fueled by the mining boom, many new structures were built in the years preceding the explosion, including the Lariat Cafe itself, which was built out of brick and cinder-block in 1955. The cafe was supplied with propane. Located in Monticello's business district, the Lariat cafe was conducting business usual on Monday, 13 August. The cafe's owner had recently agreed to switch the cafe from propane/butane gas to natural gas provided by the Utah Gas Service Co. - workmen from the company had successfully connected the town's natural gas main to the cafe the day before, thus making the older propane line obsolete. However, either a miscommunication or negligence caused the workmen to leave the cafe's old propane line open. As a result, propane gas gradually filled the cafe's basement and walls over the course of the day. At around 7 p.m on Monday evening, while the cafe was filled with between 50-70 patrons, some source ignited the built-up gas, causing the building to explode and collapse. Patrons were thrown up into the area, with some being violently dashed against flying pieces of the building. Others were severely injured or killed by the concussive force of the explosion. One victim noted that the cafe had been crumpled \\"like an egg shell\\". The blast also destroyed windows within a one-block radius of the cafe. Rescue services arrived at the scene of the disaster within minutes, where they were aided by hundreds of townspeople. More seriously injured victims were driven to Salt Lake City, though several died in transit. In all, 16 people were killed and over 30 were wounded. The disaster led to a protracted legal battle in which the cafe owner and Utah Gas Service accused each other of negligence. The legal dispute eventually reached the Utah Supreme Court in 1960, with the court deciding against Utah Gas Service Co. The court opinion stated that, while the owner of the cafe had been negligent by letting patrons inside an unsafe building, it had been Utah Gas Service Co.'s desire to sell gas to the cafe that had precipitated the disaster.

Background Mark Little, who had worked as a journalist with Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â) News(Radio-Television of Ireland). founded startup Storyful in Dublin, Ireland in 2010 as a service that \\"verified news sources and online content\\". According to Nieman Lab, Storyful had a reputation for content aggregation as a social news agency‚Äîfinding, verifying, distributing, licensing, and commercializing user-generated content, social media and online content from social networking services, including videos about stories in the news, such as the Syrian Civil War, Arab Spring protests, as well as \\"smaller viral moments\\". Storyful aimed to provide authority through its verification and monitoring tools while providing authenticity through user-generated content. In December 20, 2013 News Corp, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, purchased Storyful for US$25 million and opened a New York office in the same building as Fox News' main studios. Little left Storyful in 2015 and Gavin Sheridan, Storyful's director of innovation left in 2014. News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said that through Storyful, News Corp would \\"define the opportunities that the digital landscape presents, rather than simply adapt to them.\\" After the acquisition, the company expanded its service to include \\"commercial and creative work\\". After Murdoch acquired the company, from 2014 through to February 2018, losses \\"swelled\\", requiring a series of cash injections from News Corp. During that time the company expanded aggressively globally with a staff of about 200 worldwide up from about 30 in 2014. According to The Guardian, in 2016, journalists were encouraged by Storyful to use the social media monitoring software called Verify developed by Storyful. By installing Verify's web browser extension on their computers, Verify would inform the journalists when social media content had been \\"verified and cleared\\". The Guardian revealed that through the Verify plugin, dozens of staff in four offices had access to the journalists browsing activity without them knowing. This data allowed Storyful to actively monitor its own clients' activities on social media and to \\"turn it into an internal feed\\" at Storyful that \\"updates in real time\\". In November 2018, when a video circulated by Infowars' Paul Joseph Watson appeared to prove that CNN's Jim Acosta's contact with a White House intern was a physical blow, Storyful was able to prove that the 15-second-long clip had been doctored.A two-second long snippet was repeated, pausing three frames for a fraction of a second, which resulted in a slight time compression elsewhere. According to a January 21, 2019 article in CNN Business, Rob McDonagh, the editor of Storyful's U.S. news team, had proven that one of the viral videos that served as catalysts in the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation at January 18, 2019 Indigenous Peoples March, was posted by a suspicious account, under the handle @2020fight. McDonagh's team validates videos and posts before adding them to their \\"digest\\", distinguishing true stories from those that are not.According to The New Yorker article, McDonagh's team includes news analysts with different specialties including Anne Winberry who is a trends editor. Michael Edison Hayden \\"covers the dark underbellies of the Internet\\" such as the 4chan, 8chan, Daily Caller, etc. Storyful attempts to validate each post or video before including it in its digest. McDonagh reviewed previous content from @2020fight's account, and found it suspicious because it had a \\"high follower count, a \\"highly polarized and yet inconsistent political messaging\\", an \\"unusually high rate of tweets\\", and \\"the use of someone else's image in the profile photo.\\" reporter Donie O'Sullivan said that the @2020fight video that had been posted on January 18, which had 2.5 million views by January 22, was the one that \\"helped frame the news cycle\\". Currently the website offers a service by which video can be commercially brokered. Services Services include a newswire service‚Äîone of their \\"core pillars\\"‚Äîand social news monitoring. By February 2018, Storyful was developing \\"risk and reputation monitoring\\" services through which they would source and verify social news, fact-checking it and contextualising it for corporate clients. They were \\"developing tech tools\\" to \\"explore obscure or closed networks\\" for their intelligence team. can use to explore obscure or closed networks. They \\"track deviations in social conversations around brands and organisations and catch potential risks before they blow up. Like an alerts system.\\" The company \\"released a re-booted version of its Newswire platform in 2018. According to FORA, Storyful was developing new tools to combat fake news online. Clients When Storyful was acquired by News Corp in 2013, the company already had the Wall Street Journal, the BBC, New York Times, YouTube, ITN and Channel 4 News as clients. By 2018 their clients included CNN, ABC News and Fox News, The New York Times, the Washington Post, in the United States, ABC in Australia, and all of News Corp‚Äôs own publications. Most of their \\"reputation-conscious corporate customers\\" clients prefer to not be named.

Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity is a religiopolitical concept in the Indian subcontinent which stresses members of the two largest faith groups there, Hindus and Muslims working together for the common good. The concept was championed by various rulers of India, such as Mughal Emperor Akbar, leaders in the Indian independence movement, such as Mahatma Gandhi and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, as well as by political parties and movements, such as the Indian National Congress, Khudai Khidmatgar and All India Azad Muslim Conference. Those who opposed the partition of colonial India often adhered to the doctrine of composite nationalism.  History  In Mughal India, the emperor Akbar advocated for Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity, appointing both Hindus and Muslims as officials in his court. Akbar participated and promoted festivals of both Hinduism and Islam, he also created feasts such as Phool Walon Ki Sair (although this festival is said to have been started much later in the nineteenth century under Akbar II) to be celebrated by citizens of all faiths. Chhatrapati Shivaji also promoted Hindu-Muslim unity. Maratha Hindavi Swarajya had many Muslims in high posts. Shivaji's personal security, his most trusted courtiers were Muslims. A Muslim general had led the Maratha troops in the third battle of Panipat and sacrificed for the cause. Sayyid Jamal al-Din al- Afghani Asadabadi advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity, holding that it would effectively combat British imperialism, leading to an independent India. In the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, the Hindus and Muslims of India mobilized to fight the British. Reflecting on this in 2007, Manmohan Singh stated that these events \\"stood as a great testimony to the traditions of Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity that held out as an example for subsequent generations\\". The Lucknow Pact of 1916 was seen as an \\"important step forward in achieving Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity\\" during the era of the Indian independence movement. Muhammad Ali Jinnah advocated Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity in early years of his political career. Gopal Krishna Gokhale stated that Jinnah \\"has true stuff in him, and that freedom from all sectarian prejudice which will make him the best ambassador of Hindu‚ÄìMuslim Unity\\". Muslim scholars of the Deoband school of thought, such as Qari Muhammad Tayyib and Kifayatullah Dihlawi, championed Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity, composite nationalism, and called for a united India. Maulana Sayyid Hussain Ahmad Madani, the leader of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, stated: Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, the Premier of Punjab in colonial India, advocated for amity between the religious communities of undivided India, proclaiming March 1st as Communal Harmony Day and aiding in the establishment of a Communal Harmony Committee in Lahore, in which Raja Narendra Nath served as president and Maulvi Mahomed Ilyas as secretary.  Threats to Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity  In the First War of Indian Independence (also known as the Indian Rebellion) in 1857, Hindus and Muslims in India joined together as Indians to fight the British. The British became concerned about this rise in Indian nationalism and therefore tried to stir up communalistic feelings among Hindus and Muslims so that they might not again unite to try and overthrow crown rule. For example, Theodore Beck, the principal of Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, had told Syed Ahmad Khan that Muslims should have no sympathy with the objectives of the Indian National Congress and \\"that Anglo-Muslims unity was possible, but Hindu‚ÄìMuslims unity was impossible\\". The author of Composite Nationalism and Islam, Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, a Deobandi Muslim scholar and proponent of a united India, argued that the British were attempting to \\"scare Muslims into imagining that in a free India Muslims would lose their separate identity, and be absorbed into the Hindu fold\\", a threat that \\"aim[ed] at depoliticizing the Muslims, weaning them away from struggle for independence.\\" In the eyes of Madani, support for a two-nation theory resulted in the entrenchment of British imperialism. In the same vein, Kashmiri Indian politician and Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju wrote in The Nation: On the other hand, Ajay Verghese claims that that the conflicts between the Hindu- Muslim population existed long before Britishers set foot in India; he claims that in places where Britishers had less influence (like princely states), the number of communal riots was more frequent as compared to places which were directly under British rule (like British Indian provinces).

The law allows for cooperation between local, state and federal law enforcement in cases of violent illegal immigrants, and is often referred to as a \\"sanctuary law\\" due to its resemblance of sanctuary jurisdiction policies. According to a 2020 study, the law had no significant impact on violent and property crime rates in California. A legal challenge by the Federal government was unsuccessful in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Background The bill was passed as a response to Executive Order 13768, President Trump's initiative to oppose sanctuary cities and other jurisdictions that refuse to collaborate with federal immigration authorities, and to his stepped up deportations of illegal immigrants. The bill was introduced by State Senate President Kevin de Leon. The bill passed the Senate on September 16, 2017 27-11 on a party-line vote, with all Democrats voting in favor and all Republicans voting against. The bill passed the Assembly 51-26 on September 15, 2017, with all Republicans and three Democrats voting against. Then-Governor Jerry Brown helped pass the bill. Provisions The Sanctuary Law, a sequel to the 2013 state law called the California Trust Act, is designed to prevent local law enforcement agencies from detaining undocumented immigrants who are eligible for deportation by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for violating immigration laws except in cases where the undocumented immigrants have been convicted of serious or violent felonies, or of misdemeanors that can be classified as such felonies. Such policies have been in place in many California cities and counties for decades.Mancina, P. 2013 ‚ÄúThe birth of a sanctuary-city: a history of governmental sanctuary in San Francisco‚Äù. In R.K. Lippert and S. Rehaag (Eds) Sanctuary Practices in International Perspectives: Migration, Citizenship and Social Movements. Abingdon, UK, Routledge: 205‚Äì218. Political impact The law has received both significant support and opposition. An online poll conducted by UC Berkeley in April 2018 found that 56% of voters support the law and 41% oppose it. In March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state of California, alleging that SB 54 and other laws aimed at reducing cooperation in the state with federal immigration authorities were unconstitutional. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2018 by judge John Mendez of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, stating in his opinion that \\"The Court does not find any indication in the cited federal statutes that Congress intended for States to have no oversight over detention facilities operating within their borders.\\" The bill was a significant issue during the 2018 elections. The December 2018 killing of Ronil Singh re-inflamed debate over the new law, with some claiming that the law prevented the perpetrator from being deported before the murder took place. Governor Brown has denied that Singh's murder by an illegal immigrant had anything to do with California's new sanctuary law. Also in December 2018, an undocumented immigrant who had twice been deported, but who had returned to the United States illegally, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge but released under the new sanctuary law, and then embarked on a 24-hour shooting spree in Tulare County, killing two and injuring seven, before crashing his car and dying. Sheriff Mike Boudreaux told the press that a \\"tool has been removed from our hands,\\" and that, because the county could not turn the shooter over to ICE for deportation, \\"our county was shot up by a violent criminal.\\" Many cities and local governments in California are opposed to the state's sanctuary policies and have passed ordinances opposed to it. Most of these ordinances are symbolic however, some have joined the Trump administrations law suit against California. These cities and counties include: Orange County Board of Supervisors, San Diego County Board of Supervisors, Beaumont, Dana Point, Ripon, Los Alamitos, Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano, Aliso Viejo, Mission Viejo, Yorba Linda, Newport Beach, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Orange, Fountain Valley, and Escondido.

The original- language version of the film, in which the dialogue is principally in French, stars the voices of B√©r√©nice Bejo and Louis Garrel.  Production  Director and writer Denis Do was born in France and is of mixed French, Chinese and Cambodian heritage. The film is based on his own research and the memories of his mother, on whom the main protagonist, Chou, is based.  Plot summary  Chou lives in Phnom Penh with her husband, Khuon, their youngest son Sovanh, and their family, including Khuon's brother Meng, Chou's mother and grandmother, and their other children, Hout, Tuch, and Lili. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge topple the government and the family is forcefully evacuated from the city by the revolutionaries. Along the grueling trip, Sovanh and his grandmother become separated from the family, and the Khmer Rouge guards forbid Chou from trying to find them. When they reach the neighboring town, they realize that their Cousin Sok has become one of the revolutionaries and the entire town converted into a commune. The family is stripped of what possessions they cannot hide and worked to the bone with barely any food. Chou asks after her son and is assured he's in a different labor camp but is forbidden to see him. Meng wants to leave, but Khuon insists they have no choice but to be subservient. At Chou's insistence, Khuon tries to cross the river to find Sovanh, but is captured and beaten. Tuch falls ill, and the family gives their last valuables to a woman from the camp, known for sleeping with the Khmer Rouge, to try and find medicine. But Tuch dies before she can return. The woman returns having been unable to find medicine, and is beaten by the other women of the camp. Before dying, she leaves her own son in Chou's care. Sok takes pity on Khuon and allows him to try to find Sovanh, but by the time he arrives, the children have been moved again. Throughout, Sovanh lives on with his grandma, and a girl he befriends at his work camp. Horrific deaths unfold around him, and the girl eventually sacrifices herself to allow Sovanh to avoid capture while they steal food. Unable to stand it any longer, Meng makes a break for the border - Khuon runs after to wish him luck, but is caught by the a Khmer Rouge guard. Sok kills him, saving Khuon's life. Khuon and Chou make it back, but another vengeful Khmer Rouge kills Sok in retribution. The group is moved again on trains, and Chou is separated from the child she was trusted to look after. The train stops when one of the Khmer Rouge's daughters is drowning in a well, and Khuon helps save her, angering Chou. Soon after, the men and woman are driven to separate camps leaving only Chou, her mother, and Lili. Months pass. The Khmer Rouge woman who would have drowned, Peuv, attempts to give thanks by sneaking food to Chou and her family, but Chou rejects it despite their starvation, as a means of keeping her dignity. Chou's mother notices that one of the guards fancies Lili, and encourages her to use this to attain food. But when the guard rapes her, Lili hangs herself. At long last, Hout makes it back from the men's camp, saying he got separated from Khuon. But when he hears about what happened to Lili, he finds the guard who did it and burns him alive in a thatched hut. He is killed, alongside an innocent old woman accused of being a sympathizer. Chou's mother dies of starvation. Years pass and an emaciated Khuon finds Chou in an infirmary. He says he's found Sovanh, and she musters the last of her strength to move on. The Cambodian-Vietnamese War begins, and as Vietnamese forces advance on their camp, the two make one final break to find Sovanh. They're seen by Peuv, who covers for them, allowing their escape. After journeying far and wide, they finally find the group of children, seemingly abandoned, and among them is Sovanh. Reunited, the family makes one final break for the Thailand border. Along the way, they encounter another group of Khmer Rouge, and another senseless execution, soon to devolve into more. Chou confronts the group, tearing open her shirt to show that she has suffered just as they have and successfully saves the life of the woman who was about to die. They encourage the woman to follow them to Thailand, but the woman refuses, as she still has family in Cambodia. The family reaches the border. Khuon scouts up ahead. As Chou and Sovanh watch, Khuon is spotted by Khmer Rouge guards. He purposefully runs away, allowing his family to sneak past the border, and is shot. But Sovanh and Chou, last of their family, finally make it to Thailand, hand in hand.

Early life and education  Born in Hamburg, Eberhard Kloke studied as a conductor at the Berlin University of the Arts and also for his degree in musicology and German Studies at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Early career He began his career as a r√©p√©titeur and conductor in Mainz, Darmstadt, D√ºsseldorf and L√ºbeck before being appointed General Music Director in Ulm in 1980.

Background EFE had been planning a suburban service between Santiago and Melipilla since the mid-1990s. The project got to the tendering stage, but there were no bidders due to an underestimated budget requirement and disagreements between EFE and Santiago Metro over the location of the city centre terminal. However the first stage as far as Malloco formed part of the company's 2014-16 development plan. Yet, works were not initiated, one problem being an inability to obtain environmental approval.

He was circumcised by his father and as a Sandek was honored Rabbi Chaim Meir Yechiel Shapira of Narol. He was named after his Grandfather Rav Yaakov Yechezkiya Greenwald (the \\"Vayaged Yaakov\\"). As a child, the family emigrated to the United States where his father founded the Pupa Hasidus. Married to Bracha Frieda, the daughter of Rabbi Meir Greenwald, Av Beit Din of Tetch, his father-in-law was the cousin of his father, son of Rabbi Avraham Yosef Greenwald and grandson of Rabbi Moshe Greenwald. For many years he served as Dayan and Posek of the Pupa Hasidism, and since his father's death on August 11, 1984, he serves as the third Admor of Pupa's Hasidim. Most of his followers live in the United States (mainly New York) and Canada, and a few in Israel and London.

History  The lawyer Elio Fr√∂hlich founded the Carl Seelig Foundation in 1966, which in turn established the Robert Walser Archive in 1973, in order to maintain and expand Walser‚Äôs literary estate as well as make it available to an ever-increasing number of scholars and researchers. In 2004, the foundation was renamed the Robert Walser Foundation Zurich. The following individuals served as directors of the Robert Walser Archive from 1973 until the present (in chronological order): Katharina Kerr, Guido Stefani, Werner Morlang, Bernhard Echte, Margit Gigerl, Lucas Marco Gisi, and Lukas Gloor. In 2009, the Foundation underwent a major structural reorganization, relocated to Bern, and was renamed the Robert Walser Foundation Bern. The Robert Walser Center was opened the same year, overseen by the founding director Reto Sorg Roman Bucheli. Die Heimholung des Dichters.

Robert Walser Archive  The main focus of the Archive is the Robert Walser Collection, which includes manuscripts, letters, personal papers, and an ever- expanding collection of secondary literature, which is continuously being catalogued, documented, and analyzed. Although still owned by the Robert Walser Foundation, these valuable and sensitive manuscripts (including the so- called ‚ÄúMicrograms‚Äù or ‚ÄúMicroscripts‚Äù) were transferred in 2009 to the Swiss Literary Archives (SLA) of the Swiss National Library in Bern. The Archive also features the partial estates of Robert Walser‚Äôs siblings and those of Carl Seelig, as well as the Walser scholars Anne Gabrisch, Jochen Greven, and Werner Morlang. Since the 1980s, the Robert Walser Center and the Robert Walser Archive regularly work on special editions and other publications regarding Robert Walser.  Library  The Robert Walser Center maintains the world‚Äôs leading Walser library, which collects everything written by and about Robert Walser. In addition to all editions of Walser‚Äôs work in the original German and any existing translations, it also includes periodicals and unpublished academic theses and dissertations.Robert Walser-Zentrum: \\"Robert Walser-Zentrum.\\" Accessed 20 January 2019 (DE/EN).

It lies wholly within Italy on a ridge descending south- east from the Tour Ronde. It has been described as \\"a spectacular fin with a fine E face\\". It stands on a ridge separating the Entr√®ves glacier from the Brenva glacier, yet is somewhat overshadowed by its larger neighbours, such as the Aiguille Blanche and the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey. Nevertheless, it is a distinctive peak, offering a number of very challenging climbs, especially on its east face which consists of vertical granite flakes and cracks. On its northern side stands a distinctive, slender rock pinnacle about 60 metres high, known as the P√®re Eternel. Brenva ridge from Pointe Helbronner. Right to left: Aiguille de la Brenva, Tour de la Brenva, Rocher de la Brenva. Mont Blanc massif showing location of Aiguille de la Brenva  Climbing  The Aiguille de la Brenva was first ascended on 25 August 1898 by A. Hess, L. Croux and C. Ollier via its south-east ridge. This remains the least difficult means of ascent to this day. (Graded PD on the French adjectival climbing scale). Nowadays, its east face offers a number of challenging climbing routes: the Donvito Diedre, the Bocallette route (UIAA Grade V/V+) (first established in 1935); the very hard Bertone-Zappelli route, plus the 390m Rebuffat route (Grade V/V+), dating from 1948. The latter route is placed in 66th position by its first ascensionist, Gaston Rebuffat, in his classic mountaineering book \\"The Mont Blanc Massif - the 100 finest routes\\". The peak's north ridge provides an exposed and strenuous 150m climb, which is rarely undertaken (Grade V/V+). The P√®re Eternel pinnacle was first climbed in August 1927 by L. Grivel, O. Ortiz and A Pennard. (UIAA Grade V/V+).  Access  The peak can be accessed from the Torino Hut via the Toule glacier to reach the Br√®che de la Brenva. It can also be climbed as a \\"training exercise\\" in one day, reached direct from Courmayeur by means of a \\"stiff walk\\".

Plot  One night Sven, Anna and Stina have to stay home alone as their parents go to a funeral. Before the parents leave, they warn their children not to open the door to anybody and certainly not to a tramp. The children promise that. When Sven goes outside to check on the cat, he forgets to close the front door when entering. When it knocks outside the door, Sven automatically says \\"Come in\\". A few seconds later he regrets that, remembering the promise he made to his parents. But then it is already too late and a tramp enters the house. Stina starts to cry, because she is afraid of the man. But the tramp, whose name is Manfred, manages to calm Stina down. He tries to entertain the children, sings, plays theatre, etc. The children are thrilled and laugh about the show Manfred offers them. Thus, the tramp manages to convince the children to give him something to eat. The children want to see more and more. But when he has finished eating, Manfred decides to leave. He goes outside into the cold and the snow. The children hope he will come back soon. Cast * Bj√∂rn Gustafson: Manfred * Peter Hall: Sven * Stina Lindmark: Anna * Astrid Br√§ne: Lill-Stina * Lena T.

Life  Charlotte Milligan was born in Omagh, Co Tyrone on 17 March 1864 to Methodist parents, Seaton Milligan (1837‚Äì1916) and Charlotte Burns (1842‚Äì1916). Fox was the eldest of eleven children, with nine surviving including Alice Milligan and Edith Wheeler. All nine children enrolled at Methodist College, Belfast which provided a privileged and exceptional education. She studied classical piano and composition at the Royal College of Music in London and the Conservatoires of Frankfurt and Milan. In 1892 after her marriage to Charles Eliot Fox she settled in London. She founded the Irish Folk Song Society in London in 1904 acting as the society's honorary secretary. She was a musician in her own right and toured Ireland collecting folk songs and airs. Fox undertook a series of tours of Antrim between 1909 and 1910 with her sisters Edith Wheeler and Alice Milligan. The sisters recorded and transcribed songs by Irish singers, then publishing articles and musical scores in The Journal of Irish Folk Song. In 1910 Fox visited the east coast of America where the New York branch of the Irish Folk Song Society was formed. \\"The Bardic Recital\\" was produced on 16 March at the National Theatre, Washington. Fox collected and arranged the music for the play. Fox re- discovered Edward Bunting's papers, and under the provision of her will they came to Queen's University Belfast in 1916. From these papers she wrote The Annals of the Irish Harpers. The publication of The Annals of the Irish Harpers stimulated a revival of interest in both the Irish harp and Edward Bunting. Alice Milligan nursed her sister prior to Fox's death in London on 25 March 1916. An obituary of Charlotte Milligan Fox is in The Irish Booklover (1916). The Journal of the Irish Folk Song Society (1917) has a poem in remembrance of Charlotte Milligan Fox. The same issue has a memoir of Fox by Alice Milligan and an appreciation of Fox by Alfred Perceval Graves. Composer Fox composed music for Aine N√≠ Threasaigh. Fox also composed an original orchestral score for The Last Feast of the Fianna by Alice Milligan. Irish Folk Song Society In 1905 Fox co-founded with Alfred Perceval Graves the Irish Folk Song Society, an offshoot of Folk Song Society formed in 1898. Its aim was to collect and publish Irish airs and ballads, in addition to holding lectures and concerts on the subject. In 1904 the President of the Society was the Earl of Shaftesbury and the Vice-Presidents included PW Joyce, Francis Joseph Bigger, WH Grattan Flood, Alfred Perceval Graves, Rev. Richard Henebry and Lady Waterford. Committee members included: Herbert Hughes and Mrs Edith Wheeler. The Officers for 1905 have a publication committee comprising Claude Aveling, Charlotte Milligan Fox, Herbert Hughes, Rev Michael Moloney and Dr John Todhunter as chairman. The rules of the Society are collected in volume 4 of the Journal of the Irish Folk Song Society. The subscription is 5 shillings payable every January and committee meetings are held at the Rooms of the Irish Literary Society in London.

Agfacontour was introduced in 1970 by Agfa-Gevaert to enable producing equidensities by a direct, one developing step process. Until then equidensities had to be obtained using one of the following techniques. The most popular method to acquire equidensities was the One-Film technique, better known as Sabattier effect (a.k.a. Pseudosolarization). Another techniques making tonal extractions on high- contrast film was called Two-Film technique (negative-positive process). From the negative 3-5 different exposures were made on 3-5 ultra high-contrast films. These 3-5 positives were then copied on again ultra high-contrast films to obtain negatives. Then one positive and a different negative were sandwiched together in register to obtain one equidensity. Using the same shuffling, the other positives were combined with the negatives to make in total 2-4 sandwiches of 2-4 equidensities series. Although there are other techniques such as Scattered-light technique or Electronic (video) technique, these are less important for obtaining equidensities series. Each of these techniques had its drawbacks of which reproducibility and extensive work involvement were undoubtedly the most important ones. Therefore the researchers at Agfa-Gevaert set up a workgroup to develop a film that enables the use of equidensitometry with the following, principal evaluation methods of an information-carrier Agfacontour Professional in Wissenschaft und Technik, C. Sauer, Agfa-Gevaert AG Druckschrift nr. 152, 1. Auflage 1974 (in German) # A Black and white extract of a precisely controllable range of densities # Breakdown in separate density ranges which could be created in a manageable manner by colorizing or using Halftone screens # Distance measurement of similar densities (especially in cases of density gradients) # Information clarification in the presence of chaotic density distribution and density gradients The Agfacontour film contained two special emulsions with each different spectral sensitivity. * By using color filters (yellow or magenta) during the exposure one could respectively narrow or widen the width of the equidensity. * By varying the exposure one could change the density in the image that showed on Agfacontour as equidensity. Although the material exhibited very low sensitivity (long exposures were necessary) the results were very reproducible and second order equidensities were sharp and clear, something that with pseudo-solarization was almost impossible to achieve without special procedures. The Gamma of the material was very high (approx. above 7.0), power of resolution was 40 lines/mm Since the introduction of Photo editing software, altering curves into U-curves also produces equidensities. Equidensities serie, chromogenic development For the image at the right a darkroom process was used that encompassed the production a serie of equidensities of the negative, enlarged on Agfacontour Professional sheetfilm. Each sheet was then copied onto lith film and developed in lith developer. Each copy was then developed in a chromogenic developer. All colored lith films were then put together in register and a positive print on color paper was made.  See also  * Agfa Publication Department, Agfacontour Professional in Photographics.

She is best known for her books You, Hidden Bodies and Providence: A Novel.  Career  Kepnes was born November 1976 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Her father is Jewish and Kepnes identifies as \\"half-Jewish.\\" During her formative years, she attended Barnstable High School. After graduation, she commenced her studies at Brown University. Later, she obtained an undergraduate degree in American Civilization and worked as an entertainment reporter for Entertainment Weekly. In an interview with the Boston Globe Kepnes said her first paid writing gig was an article on boy bands, for Tiger Beat magazine. In addition to her work as a writer, she performed as a background character in the television series The $treet. In 2014 Kepnes released her first novel of the thriller series, You. Kepnes explained the darkness of You, which deconstructs the romantic-comedy tropes highlighted in many films and shows by making the protagonist a violent stalker and serial killer, saying it was written in a dark period of her life, the year her father died of cancer, and in which she experienced several other personal challenges. Later, Kepnes was initially hesitant on labeling Joe, as a few readers argued that his actions classified him as a serial killer. The author then clarified her position on the matter, citing that \\"I remember when I wrote You and someone first referred to Joe as a serial killer. I argued 'he‚Äôs not a serial killer, he meets these terrible people and has these awful thoughts, but he‚Äôs very sensitive'. It‚Äôs very strange to realise you have written a serial killer.\\" In February 2015, it was announced that Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble would develop a television series based on the novel at Showtime. Two years later, it was announced that the series was purchased by Lifetime and put on fast-track development. You premiered on September 9, 2018. On July 26, 2018, ahead of the series premiere, Lifetime announced that the series had been renewed for a second season. On December 3, 2018, it was confirmed that Lifetime had passed on a second season and that Netflix had picked up the series. The second season was released exclusively on Netflix on December 26, 2019. On January 14, 2020, You was renewed for a third season by Netflix. The third season is scheduled for release sometime in 2021. In 2016, Kepnes published a sequel to You, Hidden Bodies. It was loosely adapted in the second season of the Netflix thriller series, You. For Hidden Bodies, Kepnes had thoughts for a potential direction before its conception, stating that before \\"I was even finished with the first book I knew what my second one was going to be. I wanted to trap Joe somewhere.\\" Her third novel, Providence, published in 2018, has been described as romance-suspense-thriller, with supernatural aspects. Alison Flood, in a review published by The Guardian, wrote \\"Providence is compelling, and Kepnes provides a sometimes piercing insight into the small, strange, sad details that make up a life, though without quite achieving the deep, dark pleasures of You.\\" According to Cheryl Wassenaar, in a review in Cultures magazine, the novel is \\"a bit like Dexter meets, well, H.P. Lovecraft.\\" Kepnes is currently working on the third and fourth novels for the You series. The third novel and the sequel to Hidden Bodies, titled You Love Me is set to be released on April 6, 2021.

Three people, including the shooter, died, and seven others were injured. The case attracted national attention in the U.S. because the shooter was a convicted felon who had served time in American prisons and had reentered the country illegally for a third time, following deportations in 2004 and 2014. The shooting reignited debate over California Sanctuary Law SB54 because the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested the Tulare County sheriff's office to hold him in detention, but the Sheriff was unable to do so under the California Sanctuary Law. The shooting spree began shortly after the shooter was released. Shootings Gustavo Garcia, (36) an illegal immigrant, began with a shooting of random victims in an orchard, and continued with a robbery at a convenience store, and more shootings, and a carjacking, ending with a wrong-way police chase on a highway. During the spree he shot a woman seated in her car in the parking lot of a Motel 6 in Tulare, shot up a Shell gasoline station in Pixley, shot and killed a person standing outside a gas station in Visalia, and, at around 3 a.m. on the morning of Monday the 17th, was reported to police for standing in his ex-girlfriend's backyard, yelling threats as he shot at her house. He had disappeared before police arrived. He was next spotted by a Tulare County Sheriff's Office deputy in a gray Honda SUV on a flat county road outside the city, the deputy attempted to stop the SUV, but Garcia shot the patrol car and fled into an orchard, where he brandished his gun at three farmworkers, and stole their GMC truck. He drove south in the northbound lanes of Highway 65 at high speed, smashing into multiple cars at speeds of more than 100 mph. Finally crashing the vehicle, the perpetrator was pronounced dead at the scene at around 7 a.m. on Monday morning. Before the spree ended, three people, including the shooter, were dead, and seven others were hospitalized with injuries. Garcia had been arrested for being under the influence two days before he went on his crime spree, but was released because California police are not allowed to hold illegal aliens arrested for misdemeanors in order to turn them over to federal ICE agents for deportation. According to Tulare police, Garcia stole the bullets he used in the shooting from a Walmart store. Following Garcia's arrest, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE,) notified local police that he had already been deported twice, in 2004 and 2014. Garcia Garcia served 2 years in prison for a 2013 armed robbery, and another 27 months in prison for illegally reentering the country, before he was deported for the second time in 2014. ICE issued an immigration hold against Garcia following his arrest, but the hold was not honored. Tulare County's Board of Supervisors had adopted a resolution opposing California's \\"Sanctuary State\\" law in May 2018, but the resolution did not alter the state law's prohibition of local police holding illegal aliens charged with misdemeanors for deportation by ICE. Perpetrator Garcia Ruiz, a.k.a. \\"Junior\\", was an undocumented migrant who first arrived in the United States illegally in 1992 as a minor. In 2002, he was accused of assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy in Reedley, California; that same year, he was accused of armed robbery and possession of a firearm in Fresno, California. He was sentenced to one year in jail and three years' probation or to two years in prison; sources differ. He was deported to Mexico. Having returned to the United States illegally, he went on to spend 27 months in prison and was deported for a second time in 2014. Garc√≠a was arrested on a misdemeanor charge days before the shooting spree, but released under the provisions of the new California Sanctuary Law SB54. Aftermath This shooting has led to a reconsideration of the California Sanctuary Law by some local law enforcement authorities, Tulare County Sheriff Boudreaux is one of several California law enforcement officials questioning the wisdom of the California Sancturary law. Sheriff Mike Boudreaux told the press that a \\"tool has been removed from our hands,\\" and that, because California Sanctuary Law SB54 meant that the county could not turn the shooter over to ICE for deportation, \\"our county was shot up by a violent criminal.\\" ICE called the incident, \\"an unfortunate and extremely tragic example of how public safety is impacted with laws or policies limiting local law enforcement agencies‚Äô ability to cooperate with ICE.\\" In the wake of this shooting, California state Representative Jim Patterson called on the legislature to repeal Sanctuary Law SB54 and allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with detainer requests from ICE. Deroy Murdock asserts that the California Sanctuary Law \\"tied the hands of the Tulare County sheriff who wanted to alert U.S. authorities to the impending release of illegal immigrant Gustavo Garcia, a deeply rotten hombre.\\" President Trump invited Jody Jones, brother of spree shooting victim Rocky Jones to attend the 2020 State of the Union Address.

This mutliprotein junctional complex has a regulatory function in passage of ions, water and solutes through the paracellular pathway. It can also coordinate the motion of lipids and proteins between the apical and basolateral surfaces of the plasma membrane. Thereby tight junction conducts signaling molecules, that influence the differentiation, proliferation and polarity of cells. So tight junction plays a key role in maintenance of osmotic balance and trans-cellular transport of tissue specific molecules. Nowadays is known more than 40 different proteins, that are involved in these selective TJ channels.  Structure of tight junction  The morphology of tight junction is formed by transmembrane strands in the inner side of plasma membrane with complementary grooves on the outer side. This TJ strand network is composed by transmembrane proteins, that interact with the actin in cytoskeleton and with submembrane proteins, which send a signal into the cell. The complexity of the network structure depends on the cell type and it can be visualized and analyzed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, which shows the individual strands of the tight junction.  Function of tight junction proteins  TJ proteins could be divided in different groups according to their function or localization in tight junction. TJ proteins are mostly described in the epithelia and endothelia but also in myelinated cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system are TJ localized between a glia and an axon and within myelin sheaths, where they facilitate the signaling. Some of TJ proteins act as a scaffolds, that connect integral proteins with the actin in a cytoskeleton. Others have an ability to crosslink junctional molecules or transport vesicles through the tight junction. Some submembrane proteins are involved in the cell signaling and gene expression due to their specific binding to the transcription factor. The most important tight junction proteins are occludin, claudin and JAM family, that establish the backbone of tight junction and allow to passing of immune cells through the tissue.  TJ proteins in epithelia and endothelia  Proteins in epithelial and endothelial cells are occludin, claudin and tetraspanin, that each has a one or two different types of the conformation. All of them are created by four transmembrane regions with two (amino-, carboxyl-) extracellular domains, that are orientated towards the cytoplasm. But occludin has a structure with two similar extracellular loops compared to claudin and tetraspanin, which have one extracellular loop significantly longer than the other one. = Occludin = Occludin (60kDa) was the first identified component of tight junction. The tetraspan membrane protein is established by two extracellular loops, two extracellular domains and one short intracellular domain. The C-terminal domain of occludin is directly bound to ZO-1, which interacts with actin filaments in cytoskeleton. It works as a transmitter from and to the tight junction, because of its association with signaling molecules (PI3-kinase,PKC,YES,protein phosphases 2A, 1). This TJ protein also participate in a selective diffusion of solutes along concentration gradient and transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium and epithelium. Therefore the result of the overexpression of mutant occludin in epithelial cells leads to break down the barrier function of tight junction and changes in a migration of neutrophils. Occludin cooperates with members of the claudin family directly or indirectly and together they form the long strands of tight junction. = Claudin = The claudin family is composed by 24 members. Some of them haven¬¥t been well characterized yet but all members are encoded by 20-27kDa tetraspan proteins with two extracellular domains, one short intracellular domain and two extracellular loops, where is the first one notably larger than the second one. The C-terminal domain of claudins is required for their stability and targeting. This domain contains PDZ-binding motif, that facilitate to bind them to the PDZ membrane proteins, like a ZO-1,ZO-2,ZO-3,MUPP1. Each claudin has a specific variation and amount of charged aminoacids in the first extracellular loop. So through the repolarization of aminoacids could claudins selectively regulate the molecule transfer. In contrast to occludin, which makes paracellular holes for ion- trafficking between neighbour cells. Claudins seem to be on a tissue specific manner, because some of them are expressed only in a specific cell type. Claudin 11 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and Sertoli cells or Claudin 5 is expressed in the vascular endothelial cells. Claudin 2,3,4,7,8,12,15 are present in epithelial cells throughout the segments of intestinal tract. Claudin 7 is occurred also in epithelial cells of the lung and kidney. Claudin-18 is expressed in the alveolar epithelial cells of the lung. Most types of claudins have more than two isoforms, that have a distinguish size or function. The specific combination of these isoforms creates tight junction strands, while the occulin is not required for. Occludin play a role in selective regulation by an incorporating itself into the claudin-based strands. The different proportion of claudin species in the cell gives them specific barrier properties. Claudins also have a function in a signaling of the cell adhesion, for example Cldn 7 binds directly to adhesion molecule EpCAM on the cell membrane. And Cldn 16 is associated with reabsorption of divalent cations, because it locates in epithelial cells of thick ascending loop of Henle.  TJ proteins in myelin sheaths  = OSP/Claudin 11 = OSP/Claudin 11 is occurred in a myelin of nerve cells and between Sertoli cells, so it forms tight junctions in the CNS. This protein in a cooperation with the second loop of occludin maintains the blood-testis barrier and spermatogenesis. = PMP22/gas-3 = PMP22/gas-3, called peripheral myelin protein, is located in the myelin sheath. The expression of this protein is associated with a differentiation of Schwann cells, an establishment of tight junction in the Schwamm cell membrane or a compact formation of myelin. It is also present in epithelial cells of lungs and intestine, where interacts with occludin and ZO-1, that together create the TJ in the epithelia. PMP22/gas-3 belongs to the epithelial membrane protein family (EMP1-3), which conducts a growth and differentiation of cells. = OAP-1/TSPAN-3 = OAP-1/TSPAN-3 cooperates with Œ≤1-integrin and OSP/Claudin11 within myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes, thereby affects the proliferation and migration.  Junctional adhesion molecules  = JAM = Junctional adhesion molecules are divided in subgroups according to their composition and binding motif. Glycosylated transmembrane proteins JAMs are classified in the immunoglobulin superfamily, that are formed by two extracellular Ig-like domains: the transmembrane region and the C-terminal cytoplasmatic domain. Members of this JAM family could express two distinguish binding motifs. First subgroup composed by JAM-A, JAM-B, JAM-C has a PDZ-domain binding motif type II at their C-termini, which interacts with the PDZ domain of ZO-1, AF-6, PAR-3 and MUPP1. JAM proteins are not a part of tight junction strands but they participate in a signalization that leads to an adhesion of monocytes and neutrophils and their transmigration through the epithelium. JAMs in epithelial cells can aggregate with TJ strands, that are made of polymers of claudin and occludin. JAM-A maintains barrier properties in the endothelium and the epithelium as well as JAM-B and -C in Sertoli cells and spermatids. The second subgroup of CAR, ESAM, CLMP and JAM4 proteins contains a PDZ-domain binding motif type I at their C-termini. CAR (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor) also belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, same like JAM proteins. CAR is expressed in the epithelia of trachea, bronchi, kidney, liver and intestine, where positively contributes to the barrier function of the tight junction. This protein mediates a neutrophil migration, cells contacts and an aggregation. It¬¥s necessary for the embryonal heart development, especially for the organization of myofibrils in cardiomyocytes. CAR is associated with PDZ-scaffolding proteins MAGI-1b, PICK, PSD-95, MUPP1 and LNX. ESAM (endothelial cell selective adhesion molecule) is an immunoglobulin- transmembrane protein, which influences properties of the endothelial TJ. ESAM is present in endothelial cells and platelets but not in the epithelium and leukocytes. There, it directly binds to the MAGI-1 molecules through the ligation of C-terminal domain and PDZ-domain. This cooperation provides the formation of large molecular complex at tight junctions in the endothelium. JAM4 is a component of immunoglobulin superfamily JAM but it expresses a PDZ- domain binding motif class I (doesn¬¥t express a class II like members JAM-A,-B,-C). The JAM4 is situated in a kidney glomeruli and an intestine epithelium, where cooperates with MAGI-1, ZO-1, occludin and effectively regulates the permeability of these cells. JAM4 has a cell adhesion activity, which is conducted by MAGI-1. = Myelin Protein 0 = Protein 0 is a major myelin protein of the peripheral nervous system, which integrates with PMP22. Together they form and compact myelin sheaths of nerve cells.  Plaque proteins in the tight junction  Plaque proteins are molecules, that are required for the coordination of signals coming from the plasma membrane. In recent years exist about 30 different proteins associated with cytoplasmatic properties of the tight junction. One group of these proteins are attended in the organization of transmembrane proteins and the interaction with actin filaments. This PDZ-containing group is composed by ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, AF-6, MAGI, MUPP1, PAR, PATJ, and the PDZ domain gives them a scaffolding function. PDZ domains are important for a clustering and an anchoring of transmembrane proteins. With the first group interacts one plaque protein without PDZ domain, called cingulin, which plays a key role in the cell adhesion. The second group of plague proteins are used for a vesicular trafficking, barrier regulation and gene transcription, because certain of them are transcription factors or proteins with nuclear functions. Members of this second group are ZONAB, Ral-A,Raf-1, PKC, symplekin, cingulin and some more. They are characterized by lacking of the PDZ domain.

Biography Stewart played high school football at Vero Beach High School in Vero Beach, Florida, where he rushed for 1,932 yards in his senior season. Heavily recruited by college football programs, Stewart decided to attend the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. He redshirted in 1991, and did not play in 1992 due to a shoulder injury. He then played a total of 20 games for the Miami Hurricanes in 1993 and 1994, rushing for 1,328 yards and 17 touchdowns. While at Miami, he was teammates with Warren Sapp. The 1994 Hurricanes reached the Bowl Coalition's championship game for that season, the 1995 Orange Bowl, where Stewart rushed for 72 net yards as Miami lost to Nebraska, 24‚Äì17. Stewart was selected in the fifth round of the 1995 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. With the 1995 Vikings, he appeared in four games, rushing for 144 yards on 31 carries. He sustained a broken fibula in a November game against the New Orleans Saints, and did not play again that season. During the 1996 preseason, Stewart again broke the same bone, against the same team, the Saints. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve, missing the season. Stewart was released by the Vikings in August 1997. He would return to play for the Miami Tropics of the short lived Spring Football League in 2000. In April 2002, Stewart was indicted on counterfeit currency charges after being found in possession of counterfeit bills during a traffic stop. June 2003, Stewart pleaded guilty to federal charges related to cocaine distribution. He was subsequently sentenced to four years and four months in federal prison.

Similarly to the greedy colouring algorithm, DSatur colours the vertices of a graph one after another, expending a previously unused colour when needed. Once a new vertex has been coloured, the algorithm determines which of the remaining uncoloured vertices has the highest number of colours in its neighbourhood and colours this vertex next. Br√©laz defines this number as the degree of saturation of a given vertex. The contraction of the degree of saturation forms the name of the algorithm. DSatur is a heuristic graph colouring algorithm, yet produces exact results for bipartite, cycle, and wheel graphs. DSatur has also been referred to as saturation LF in the literature.  Pseudocode  Define the degree of saturation of a vertex as the number of different colours in its neighbourhood. Given a simple, undirected graph G compromising vertex set V and edge set E: # Generate a degree ordering of V. # Select a vertex of maximal degree and colour it with the first colour. # Consider a vertex with the highest degree of saturation. Break ties by considering that vertex with the highest degree. Further ties are broken randomly. # Loop through the colour classes created so far, and colour the selected vertex with the first suitable colour. # Unless V is all coloured, return to step 3  Performance  The worst-case complexity of DSatur is Œü(n2), however in practical some additional expenses result from the need for holding the degree of saturation of the uncoloured vertices. DSatur has been proven to be exact for bipartite graphs, as well as for cycle and wheel graphs. In an empirical comparison by Lewis 2015, DSatur produced significantly better vertex colourings than the greedy algorithm on random graphs with edge probability p = 0.5 at varying number of vertices, while in turn producing significantly worse colourings than the Recursive Largest First algorithm.
