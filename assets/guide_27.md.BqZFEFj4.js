She was married to the politician count Carl De Geer, over whom she is believed to have exerted influence, and was a central figure in the Stockholm high society in the mid-19th century. Life Ulla De Geer was born to Baron Johan Vilhelm Sprengtporten and Sophia Lovisa Mörner af Morlanda and the sister of the politician baron Jakob Wilhelm Sprengtporten. She married the politician count Carl De Geer in 1810. The marriage was arranged and she had been forced to abandon Karl Fredrik Reinhold von Essen, with whom she was truly in love. This caused a depression which attracted attention: after the death of von Essen in 1820, she publicly dressed in mourning as if she were a widow.Carl De Geer, urn:sbl:17344, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B.

She used the ritualized system of visits and regular receptions to create valuable contacts which could be used to gather information and wild influence. She adhered strictly to ceremony, and it is described how her guests were to pass through three salons before reaching her, where she greeted them ceremoniously. She rivaled Claire Lucie Mouradgea d'Ohsson (1776-1861), in whose salon foreign diplomat where to be introduced to the Swedish aristocracy, but Ulla De Geer has been described as the leading Swedish society hostess of her generation: through her connections, she belonged to those who set the tone for what was acceptable, and was described as a \\"powerful person in high society\\".Rundquist, Angela, Blått blod och liljevita händer: en etnologisk studie av aristokratiska kvinnor 1850-1900, Carlsson, Diss.

The second half of the 19th century became a break with old customs within the Swedish aristocracy and the old system with ritualized visits and receptions dissipated. F. U.

Rather, it revolved around the Lebanese Rocket Society which emerged from the Haigazian College Rocket Society, and was founded by Manoug Manougian in 1960. The original society gained fame in Lebanon after a series of successful launches of Cedar rockets and in 1962 President Fouad Chehab announced limited governmental funding for the renamed Lebanese Rocket Society which was also contacted by the Lebanese military to develop weapons. Lebanese Rocket Society The Lebanese Rocket Society which was led by Manoug Manougian consisted of a small group of students from the Haigazian University. The society developed into the wider Lebanese space program and it produced the first rockets of the Arab World, which were capable of suborbital flight. In November 1960, a group of Haigazian College students got together under the guidance of Manoug Manougian (a Mathematics and Physics instructor) to form the Haigazian College Rocket Society (HCRS). With an initial budget of 750 Lebanese pounds donated by the late deputy Emile Bustani, the members of the HCRS: Simon Aprahamian, Garabed Basmadjian, Hampartsum Karageuzian, Hrair Kelechian, Michael Ladah and John Tilkian, set out to prepare single and multistage solid fuel rockets. Aspects of the first single-stage rocket were assigned to each student. As a result of the lack of required equipment, the group was obliged to resort to flight testing without any fuel tests in the laboratories. After a number of failures, the project was finally successful. In April 1961, a single-stage solid propellant rocket was launched and reached an altitude of about one kilometer. With further improvements of the solid fuel system, a similar rocket called HCRS-3 was launched all the way up to 2 km. The Lebanese President, Fouad Chehab, as a result of these experiments, met with the members of HCRS and granted financial assistance for the project (10 thousand LL for 1961 and 15 thousand LL for 1962). During the academic year 1961-1962, the society worked on two-stage rockets with further improvements of the separation system, solid fuel system, and vehicle design. On May 25, 1962, HCRS-7 Cedar was Launched up to 11.5 km, and the Lebanese Army was responsible for the security of the launch. In the summer of 1962, two more rockets, Cedar llB and Cedar llC, were launched to a distance of 20 km. Due to the successes of the HCRS, new members joined and a new group was formed in 1962, it was called the Lebanese Rocket Society (LRS). The LRS was directed by a main committee of six members: Mr. M. Manougian of Haigazian College (director), Dr. P. Mourad of AUB (advisor), Mr. Karamanougian of Haigazian college, Mr. J. Sfeir (electronic engineer), Mr. E. Kai (engineer geodesist), and an officer expert in ballistics (granted by the Army). Further tests were planned on design and construction of multistage rockets. Mr. Hart supervised the works of the HCRS while Mr. Manougian was in the U.S. Members of the HCRS at the college were: Hampartzum Karaguezian, Hrair Aintablian, Hrair Sahagian, Jirair Zenian, and Jean Jack Guvlekjian. On November 21, 1962, Cedar-3, a three stages solid propellant rocket prepared by the Haigazian group was launched. It had a length of 6.80 m and weight of 1250 kg. After several other launchings, an accident occurred during the summer of 1964, which hospitalized 2 students who fortunately recovered. However, the launch was ended, and no accidents have taken place since. In 1963, a Cedar IV rocket was launched and reached altitude, putting it close to the altitude of satellites in Low Earth Orbit. The rocket was later commemorated on a stamp. The final launch by the Lebanon Rocket Society was in 1966. In popular culture A reproduction of a 1964 postage stamp was produced by the Lebanese postal service to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the Lebanese Independence. Depicted is one of Haigazian College's Cedar rockets. The society and wider Lebanese space programme is the focus of a 2012 film called The Lebanese Rocket Society.

It is located in the village of Stavang. It is the church for the Bru parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The whitewashed brick church was built in a long church style in 1957 by the architect Ole Halvorsen from Bergen. The church seats about 312 people. The church was consecrated on 16 June 1957, by Bishop Ragnvald Indrebø. History View of the old church on Svanøy (in the distance), circa 1850. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the church was not new at that time. Historically, the church was known as Bru Church and it was located on the island of Svanøya (the island was historically known as Bru or Brulandet) which is why the parish was named after the island. Over time, the island was renamed Svanøya, but the parish name remained. The old medieval stave church stood for centuries on the island. During the first half of the 1600s, the church was torn down and replaced with a timber-framed building with a cruciform floor plan. By the 1800s, the old Bru Church was in bad condition and needed repair. In the 1860s, the parish council decided to build a new church and a vicarage for Bru parish, but rather than replace the church on the island of Svanøya, they would build it on the mainland and tear down the old church on Svanøya. A new wooden church, known as Stavang Church was built in 1873 in the village of Stavang on the mainland. It was designed by the architect Christian Christie. This new church, however, did not last very long. On the day before Christmas Eve 1951, it burned to the ground. Due to the tremendous amount of rebuilding after World War II, it took about six years before a new church was completed. The Stavang Church was the first church to be built in the county after World War II. In the meantime, the local school building was used for church functions. Building Stavang Church is one of the three brick churches in the county, the two others being Svelgen Chapel and Farnes Church. The exterior and interior walls are whitewashed. Towards the north, an addition has been built containing a large meeting room for the congregation. The church has four big, high windows on either side of the nave, and the altarpiece is a colourful stained-glass window on the back wall of the chancel. The old church on the island of Svanøya also had some fine stained-glass windows, so this type of decoration has been a tradition in the parish for a long time. There is a richly coloured mosaic on the pulpit also. The total building costs in 1957 amounted to plus another for the organ. For the consecration ceremony, 90 boats anchored up in the harbour, and 1500 people wanted to get inside the church, but most of them had to listen to the sermon through loudspeakers outside.

Life and work Paul Boston was born in Melbourne in 1952. While with at art school he developed an interest in Zen. After graduating, Boston traveled to Japan and South East Asia, where he spent time developing his Zen practice which informs much of his later work. Taking inspiration from Cubist and Abstract art, Boston has explored the nature of paradox in his paintings and drawings and has shown an interest in the interchangeability of form and space. Taking from his involvement with Zen practice, Boston is interested in creating a sense of the meditation experience for the viewer through his work, something he calls a contemplative presence, showing a careful consideration for tone and a refinement towards the fabrication of forms, whereby his shapes come to mean different things to different people. Boston has produced an impressive body of work that has been shown in solo exhibitions throughout Australia and in group shows in Australia and overseas. He is the recipient of a number of prizes and his work is included in the collections of all major Australian public galleries and a number of important private and corporate collections throughout the world. Boston currently lives and works in Melbourne. Exhibitions Throughout his 30-year career Boston has held 20 solo shows in Australia and has participated in over 45 group exhibitions in Australia and overseas. Since 1993 he has shown regularly at Niagara Galleries, Melbourne and has represented them at the Korea International Art Fair in 2010, 2011 and 2012 and at the Auckland Art Fair in 2007 and 2011.

A- Intact human sarcocyst (length 190 µm) with thin cyst wall (arrow) from homogenized temporalis tissue inoculated into a U937 monocytic cell culture (original magnification ×200, scale bar = 20 µm). B- Intramuscular sarcocyst enclosed by a thin smooth cyst wall (arrow) without any protrusions. Maximum cyst wall thickness is about 0.5 µm (hematoxylin and eosin stained, original magnification ×40, scale bar = 10 µm). An outbreak investigation was conducted on 93 symptomatic persons from Malaysia following a college retreat on January 17–19, 2012, on Pangkor Island. Predominant manifestations were fever (relapsing in about 50% of patients), myalgia, headache, and cough. Although only two patients were confirmed to be acutely infected with S. nesbitti, the remaining students and teachers in the group likely had the same infection, because nearly all had similar signs and symptoms with onset of illness within days of each other. In addition, 9 patients had a distinctive facial myositis, but sarcocysts could not be verified in all of them because only three patients agreed to provide a muscle biopsy specimen. History of discovery In 1843, Swiss scientist Friedrich Miescher found “milky white threads” in the muscles of a mouse, which for years were known as “Miescher’s tubules”. In 1882, Lankester named the parasite Sarcocystis, from the Greek sarx (flesh) and kystis (bladder). Scientists were unsure whether to classify the organisms as protozoa or as fungi because only the sarcocyst stage had been identified. In 1967, crescent- shaped structures typical of some parasitic protozoa were seen in sarcocyst cultures, and the organism was determined to be a protozoan, a close relative of Toxoplasma. In the early 1970s, the two-host lifecycle of Sarcocystis was actually elucidated. In 1969, A. M. Mandour described a new species of Sarcocystis in rhesus macaques, which he named Sarcocystis nesbitti, after Mr. P. Nesbitt, who saw the trophozoites in stained smears. Snakes are now known to be the definitive hosts of S. nesbitti, and several primates, including humans, can be intermediate hosts.

Chartered by the U.S. Army in 1917 for use as a troop transport ship, Antilles was sunk by a German U-boat on 17 October 1917, resulting in the loss of 67 lives. At the time of its destruction the Antilles sinking represented the largest single greatest loss of American lives to that point in World War I. History=Construction SS Antilles, official number 204018, was a 6,879 gross ton vessel constructed in the shipyards of William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania delivered April 1907. Antilles was a twin screw steam vessel with nominal speed of and dimensions of on load line, extreme beam and mean draft of with a displacement at normal coal supply of 10,500 tons. The vessel was operated as a combined passenger and cargo ship by the Southern Pacific Steamship Company from the time of its launch until 1917. Antilles and sister ship Momus, along with several other ships, operated between New York and New Orleans with Southern Pacific Steamship's Morgan Line. Destruction With America's first convoy. The troop ships are the Henderson, Antilles, Momus and Lenape. Following American entry into World War I, selected by the Shipping Control Committee, Antilles was turned over 26 May 1917 and chartered by the United States Army for use as a civilian crewed U.S. Army Chartered Transport (USACT).Army owned vessels of the period were U.S. Army Transports (U.S.A.T.) while the WW I abbreviation for Army chartered civilian vessels was U.S.A.C.T. (U.S. Army Chartered Transport). The ship was among those in the first troop convoy to depart on 14 June, after considerable confusion and delays in troop loading, from the Hoboken Port of Embarkation. Antilles sailed from New York on 24 September in a four ship convoy, designated Group Number 8, composed of Antilles, a new Navy transport , another Army chartered transport and another Army chartered ship that turned back, . The convoy made the crossing successfully but both Antilles and Finland were torpedoed on the return voyage. Landing U.S. Army personnel at Saint Nazaire On 17 October 1917, three days out of Saint Nazaire, France and two days out of Quiberon Bay where another ship had joined the convoy for the return voyage, Antilles was torpedoed by German U-boat reportedly sinking in four and a half minutes after being hit. The ship was in a small convoy composed of Antilles, Henderson and Willehad escorted by the patrol yachts , , and . Both Aphrodite and Corsair had been among the escort on that first convoy to France in June. In rough weather Kanawha had been forced to turn back due to the weather with the convoy slowed by the same weather. At about 6:45 a.m., during a course change, Antilles was astern of Corsair and seen to suddenly sheer out of formation and began settling by the stern. Alcedo turned back to where Antilles had sunk and began picking up survivors while Corsair circled in a search for the submarine until about 8:30 with no sign of a submarine found and the search for survivors and the submarine discontinued at 10:30. The survivors of the U.S. Army Chartered Transport (USACT) Antilles were rescued by USS Alcedo. The majority, 118 survivors, were rescued by Alcedo with 50 rescued by Corsair. Among the fifty persons rescued by Corsair was then Brigadier General William Sharp McNair who had been ordered to return to take command of 151st Field Artillery Brigade. A total of 67 lives were lost in the sinking. The loss of life was the first case in the war involving a large number of American casualties. Survivors were landed in France on 21 October where they were immediately cared for by the Red Cross. Those that died were some of the first to come under the new war-insurance law allowing payment of $6,000 ($ in ) payable to families in installments of $25 ($ in ) per month over twenty years.

This wind wave model generates forecasts of wave conditions through the use of wave-action conservation and the wind-field forecasts (from weather forecasting models). In continuum mechanics, wave action refers to a conservable measure of the wave part of a motion. For small-amplitude and slowly varying waves, the wave action density is: :\\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\frac{E}{\\\\omega_i}, where E is the intrinsic wave energy and \\\\omega_i is the intrinsic frequency of the slowly modulated waves – intrinsic here implying: as observed in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity of the motion. The action of a wave was introduced by in the study of the (pseudo) energy and momentum of waves in plasmas. derived the conservation of wave action – identified as an adiabatic invariant – from an averaged Lagrangian description of slowly varying nonlinear wave trains in inhomogeneous media: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\mathcal{A} + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{B}} = 0, where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{B}} is the wave-action density flux and \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{B}} is the divergence of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{B}}. The description of waves in inhomogeneous and moving media was further elaborated by for the case of small-amplitude waves; they also called the quantity wave action (by which name it has been referred to subsequently). For small-amplitude waves the conservation of wave action becomes: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\left( \\\\frac{E}{\\\\omega_i} \\\\right) + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{U} + \\\\boldsymbol{c}_g \\\\right)\\\\, \\\\frac{E}{\\\\omega_i} \\\\right] = 0, using \\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\frac{E}{\\\\omega_i} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{B}} = \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{U} + \\\\boldsymbol{c}_g \\\\right) \\\\mathcal{A}, where \\\\boldsymbol{c}_g is the group velocity and \\\\boldsymbol{U} the mean velocity of the inhomogeneous moving medium. While the total energy (the sum of the energies of the mean motion and of the wave motion) is conserved for a non-dissipative system, the energy of the wave motion is not conserved, since in general there can be an exchange of energy with the mean motion. However, wave action is a quantity which is conserved for the wave-part of the motion. The equation for the conservation of wave action is for instance used extensively in wind wave models to forecast sea states as needed by mariners, the offshore industry and for coastal defense. Also in plasma physics and acoustics the concept of wave action is used. The derivation of an exact wave-action equation for more general wave motion – not limited to slowly modulated waves, small-amplitude waves or (non-dissipative) conservative systems – was provided and analysed by using the framework of the generalised Lagrangian mean for the separation of wave and mean motion.

She recommended, therefore, that the proposal be amended to allow human trafficking victims to become permanent residents of Canada and therefore be better guarded against being trafficked again. Rico became the president of the Canadian Council for Refugees in 2012. In 2013, Rico remarked that, \\"unfortunately, the government has been closing the door on refugees.\\" Specifically, she criticized Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, for having promised that Canada would resettle more refugees from 2011-2012 than in previous years, but not following through on this promise; instead, there was a 26% drop in refugee resettlement in Canada during that period, hitting a 30-year low.

It is most common in the bald eagle and American coot, and it is known in the killdeer, bufflehead, northern shoveler, American wigeon, Canada goose, great horned owl, mallard, and ring-necked duck. Avian vacuolar myelinopathy is a newly discovered disease that was first identified in the field in 1994 when dead bald eagles were found near DeGray Lake in Arkansas in the United States. Since then, it has spread to four more states and infested multiple aquatic systems including 10 reservoirs. The cause of death is lesions on the brain and spinal cord, but the exact causative agent is still being investigated by researchers. An infectious cyanobacterium is suspected. Clinical signs Clinical signs have been recorded from research studies where individual birds were intentionally infected with the disease and from wild specimens and dead birds recovered from the field. Clinical signs listed are also those observed in American coots. *Raptors have been seen flying into objects, such as trees and rock faces *Waterfowl swim awkwardly, sometimes on their backs *Lack of coordination in flying and walking, sometimes dragging wings or one leg *Waterfowl crash land into water *Tremors of the head *Weight loss *Unresponsiveness to noise *Limb weakness *Beak and tongue weakness *Decreased pain response Most of the bald eagles have been found deceased from October to March, while the death count peaks during mid-November through December. The waterfowl migrate to the area in October and November, where they consume the bacteria off plants and become infected. Causative agent proposal Researchers currently believe that the probable cause of the disease is a strain of epiphytic cyanobacteria of the order Stigonematales. This particular bacterium grows very well on aquatic plants, particularly on the invasive species hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), covering 20-90% of the leaf surface. These invasive hydrilla plants often take over any aquatic system to which they are introduced. Waterfowl then consume the hydrilla, ingesting the cyanobacteria. Some raptors, like bald eagles, prey upon the waterfowl and contract identical clinical symptoms from consuming infected tissues. The bacterium causes widespread bilaterally symmetrical vacuolation of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord of infected birds, which cause lesions. Research highlights Birrenkott et al. (2004) attempted a study in 2004 to determine linkage between the invasive aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata and the outbreak of AVM among waterfowl after it was observed that only lakes containing excess amounts of hydrilla harbored infected birds. In this study, adult mallards and northern bobwhites were divided by species into multiple sections to observe the effects of hydrilla when it was ingested by the birds, and also by physical contact or drinking of water containing hydrilla. The results of this study found that drinking water or physical contact with hydrilla or areas in which it was present had no noticeable effect on test birds. However, when fed a diet of over 50% hydrilla, the birds developed AVM. Wilde et al. (2005) performed a study to determine the cause of AVM by conducting food trials in areas affected by AVM. Disease-free mallards were fed cyanobacteria from hydrilla and observed daily. Birds that developed symptoms were captured and euthanized. By the conclusion of the study, 15 of the 20 study mallards had been recovered, and all had AVM.

The museum accepts donated artifacts that meet these criteria for inclusion in the collection. The MOAH collection is housed in a remote warehouse and is seldom open to the public. Categories typical to the collection include: sewing machines, mechanical typewriters, cameras, radios and televisions, clocks, toys, adding machines and mechanical calculators, and kitchen appliances.

It is reported to be one of the largest collections of its kind in the United States. Items from the collection are used for MOAH permanent and rotating exhibits. Other museums and institutions are able to borrow items from the MOAH collection for their exhibits or other displays. Organizations that have borrowed exhibit materials from MOAH include the San Francisco International Airport museum, the Los Altos History Museum, San Jose State University theater department, and the Stanford Federal Credit union. The museum collection database is currently only accessible during public hours at the main museum location in Palo Alto.  House  The Museum of American Heritage is currently open to the public in the Williams House on Homer Ave. in Palo Alto. This house was custom built in 1907 by Dr. Thomas Williams for his residence and private medical practice. Dr Williams is noted for having opened the first doctors office in the Palo Alto area. The house is a Tudor Revival design, and the architect was Ernest Coxhead. The house was owned by the Williams family until the death of the last living daughter of Thomas and Dora Williams. The house was bequeathed to the city of Palo Alto to be used for the community benefit. In 1997, Palo Alto asked for request for proposals of how to use the property. The city selected the Museum of American Heritage proposal, and after a significant restoration the museum opened its doors to public in 1998. Significant features of the Williams house include: *Two story portion for the family living quarters with extensive built in cabinetry (the upstairs is currently not open to the general public) *Single story section designed specifically for Dr. Williams medical practice including an operating room with a large skylight for illumination *A large detached garage which housed one of the first automobiles in Palo Alto (this building was substantially altered during the 1997 restoration). The Williams house is currently on the Palo Alto Historic Inventories list as a Class 2 Palo Alto Historic building. The building behind the main house (labeled \\"Livermore Learning Center\\") is a new structure and is located where a small family orchard was originally located.  The Williams House Gardens  Path in the backyard garden Early photographs of the Williams' property show an open vista with an unobstructed view of the house, the beginnings of landscape, and only a few native trees. But Dora Williams' interest and proficiency in gardening developed along with her garden until it reached a height of complexity in the 1920s and 1930s. Her extensive notes on the garden document the garden development over the years, and have allowed the garden to be restored to its original state. Unlike many public specimen gardens, this garden was (and remains) representative of an early 20th Century residential landscape. Featuring \\"outdoor rooms\\" delineated by rock walls and border plantings and punctuated by ornamental fountains and ponds. At the same time the garden area served the more utilitarian functions required by the Williams family, such as a vegetable garden, a medicinal plants garden, clothes drying, and composting. It is attributed to be the only historically preserved landscape in Palo Alto, and one of the few in California. The Museum of American Heritage is currently preserving the Williams House Garden.

The Independence hypothesis is a proposed solution to the synoptic problem. It holds that Matthew, Mark, and Luke are each original compositions formed independently of each other, with no documentary relationship. Scholars have long noted that the three synoptic gospels have a great deal in common, not just in content but also in order and precise Greek wording. Most scholars have assumed that this must be due to some sort of literary interrelationship among the gospels, with fragments of text copied from one source to another, but have struggled to find a satisfactory theory of who copied from whom. The independence theory rejects this consensus of documentary dependence; rather, each evangelist has independently drawn from eyewitness accounts and perhaps liturgy and other oral tradition. The similarities among the synoptic gospels, the whole basis for the synoptic problem, are held to be, first of all, vastly overstated, and secondly, explainable as artifacts of relying on the same witnesses or of different witnesses to the same events. The witnesses to the gospel content, especially apostles such as Peter, would have preached their testimony countless times before contributing to the gospels, and such numerous rehearsals tend to make a story settle into a relatively consistent wording. Any of this material that entered public liturgy (e.g., the Lord's prayer) would become even more stabilized. On the other hand, different witnesses nearly always preserve different details and present numerous minor inconsistencies. So, too, does a single witness consulted on different occasions. Moreover, sayings and anonymous healings may have recurred many times in a similar fashion, so that seemingly similar accounts actually preserve distinct events. What we would expect to see in the gospels according to this method of composition, goes the theory, is exactly what we find: many similar accounts, often with virtually identical wording, but many additions and omissions, a somewhat different selection of content in each, and apparent inconsistencies of order and details. Some see the independence theory as especially consistent with divine inspiration of the gospels, with the similarities among the gospels explained by the Holy Spirit ensuring a faithful record of Christ's words and deeds. Protestant theologian Eta Linnemann argues that the reason for four independent Gospels stems from the legal principle of : \\"On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed.\\" See also * Oral gospel tradition * Hebrew gospel hypothesis * Criterion of multiple attestation References * Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony (2006). * Werner Kelber, The Oral-Scribal-Memorial Arts of Communication in Early Christianity (2008). * Eta Linnemann, Is There a Synoptic Problem?: Rethinking the Literary Dependence of the First Three Gospels (1992). * Bo Reicke, The Roots of the Synoptic Gospels (1986). * John M.

An intellectual, she was involved in many social issues of her day, advocating for the abolition of slavery, the rights of women and of Native Americans and the welfare of animals, and campaigned for her famous husband to take a public stand on the causes in which she believed.Brown, Amy Belding, Mr. Emerson's Wife, St. Martin's Griffin, 2006. Biography=Early life The fifth child of Charles and Lucy Cotton Jackson, Lydia Jackson was raised in austerity; by the time she was orphaned at sixteen, two of her siblings had also died, and Lydia was sent to live with relatives.Richardson, Robert D. Jr., Emerson: The Mind on Fire, University of California Press, 1995, p. 167. At the age of nineteen she developed scarlet fever, which was judged the source of her lifelong poor health. Her head was said to be \\"hot ever after.\\" Chronic digestive problems, coupled with gastric and epigastric pain, discouraged her from eating, to the point that she became quite thin. She dosed herself with calomel, a commonly used mercury-containing preparation now known to damage health.Baker, Carlos, Emerson Among the Eccentrics, Penguin Books, New York, 1997, p. 40. The terror of her childhood would haunt Lydia Jackson all her life.Richardson, Robert D. Jr., Emerson: The Mind on Fire, University of California Press, 1995, p. 194. Marriage In 1834, Lydia Jackson heard Ralph Waldo Emerson give a lecture in her town of Plymouth, Massachusetts and was \\"so lifted to higher thoughts\\" that she had to hurry home before those thoughts could be tainted with everyday things. She attended another lecture and a social gathering afterward, where she was able to speak with Mr. Emerson. Although by nature a practical woman, she was inclined toward belief in omens and experienced two pre-cognitive episodes, in which she saw herself married to Emerson although they had met only once. A letter from Emerson containing a marriage proposal arrived soon after Lydia's vision of his face, looking into her eyes. Although content, at age thirty-two, with the life of a spinster-aunt who tended a garden and kept chickens, Lydia Jackson accepted Ralph Waldo Emerson's proposal.Baker, Carlos, Emerson Among the Eccentrics, Penguin Books, New York, 1997, pp. 36-38. Mayflower House Museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts: the girlhood home of Lidian Emerson The couple were married on September 14, 1835, in the parlor of the Jackson family home overlooking Plymouth Harbor. The house, known as the Edward Winslow House, is now the headquarters of The Mayflower Society. Newlyweds Lydia and Ralph Waldo Emerson settled immediately in Concord, in a large white house they named \\"Bush\\". It was here Lydia Emerson would play hostess to a continual stream of dinner and overnight guests throughout the years of her marriage.Dear Mr. Emerson, The New York Times review of the book, The Selected Letters of Lidian Jackson Emerson, Delores Bird Carpenter, ed., Columbia: University of Missouri Press, which may be read on line at . Emerson Family Home in Concord Emerson immediately began calling his wife \\"Lidian\\" rather than Lydia, possibly to avoid her name being pronounced \\"Lidiar\\" as would be common in New England.Emerson, Ellen Tucker, The Life of Lidian Jackson Emerson, Delores Bird Carpenter, ed., Boston: Twayne, 1981,. In his book, Emerson Among the Eccentrics, Carlos Baker suggests the possibility Emerson made the change because \\"something in his quiet association with her recalled to his memory Milton's lines from L'Allegro: And ever, against eating cares, Lap me in soft Lydian airs, Married to immortal verse Such as the meeting soul may pierce...\\"Baker, Carlos, Emerson Among the Eccentrics, Penguin Books, New York, 1997, p,38. On the other hand, Lidian always referred to her husband as \\"Mr. Emerson\\", reflecting \\"New England reserve\\" rather than lack of affection.Richardson, Robert D.,Jr., Emerson: The Mind on Fire, University of California Press, 1995, p. 192. Lydia Jackson's name is \\"Lidian\\" on her tombstone in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Front Face of Gravestone of Lidian Jackson Emerson, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery Motherhood Lidian's frequent bouts of illness and chronic fatigue were exacerbated during pregnancy, when it was difficult for her to take proper nourishment due to gastric upset. Nevertheless, the Emersons had four children. Waldo, born October 30, 1836, succumbed to scarlet fever at age five, a loss from which Lidian never recovered.Brooks, Paul, The People of Concord: One Year in the Flowering of New England, Chester, Connecticut: Globe Pequot Press, 1990, p. 25 Eldest daughter Ellen Tucker Emerson, born February 24, 1839, was named for the first wife of Ralph Waldo Emerson at Lidian's suggestion. She remained unmarried and proved to be a great help to her father in his work. She wrote a biography of her mother and lived to the age of sixty-nine. Edith Emerson, born November 22, 1841, married William Hathaway Forbes, son of John Murray Forbes, bore him eight children, and lived to be eighty-seven. Edward Waldo Emerson, born July 10, 1844, became a medical doctor and, upon his death at eighty-five, had outlived all but one of his seven children. The Emerson family is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, on Author's Ridge. Friendships A friendship developed between Lidian Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who roomed with the Emersons, assisting with household maintenance and guiding the Emerson children. When Emerson went abroad in 1847, Thoreau wrote him that \\"Lidian and I make very good housekeepers. She is a very dear sister to me.\\" Beliefs In his own autobiography, Franklin Benjamin Sanborn describes Emerson's aunt, Mary Moody Emerson, greeting the new Mrs. Emerson with, \\"You know, dear, that we think you are among us, but not of us.\\"Sanborn, F.B. Recollections of Seventy Years, Vol. 2, Boston, Richard G. Badger, the Gorham Press, 1909, pp. 481-482. Years later, Ellen Emerson would explain that her mother always felt her home to be Plymouth; Lidian Jackson Emerson never fully engaged in the life of Concord, and never fully shared her husband's philosophy, which came into conflict with the strict orthodoxy of an upbringing into which the circumstances of her life would cause her to retreat.Brooks, Paul, The People of Concord: One Year in the Flowering of New England, Chester, Connecticut: Globe Pequot Press, 1990, pp. 22-24. Sanborn would opine that \\"Mrs. Emerson held a position in religion midway between the gloomy, fading Calvinism of Mary Emerson, and the intuitive, ideal Theism of her nephew.\\" Lidian Jackson Emerson in old age Death In mid-November, 1892, Ellen Emerson reported that her mother was breathing heavily, as though she had a cold. :: \\"Before we went to bed Miss LeavittLucy Leavitt was hired as Lidian Emerson's caregiver. was seriously alarmed. I asked Mother if I should read to her. She asked what. I said father's letters to Mr. Carlyle, and she said, By all means. I read and she slept. At about seven I tried to give her some hot milk from the sprout-cup. She said, I can't. The rattling in her throat stopped, she opened her eyes, I saw she was dying for they were dead. At 7:35 I think she breathed her last. I sent for Miss Leavitt, who smoothed her hair. Edward was a wise and skillful hand, and a great comfort.\\" Clark, Tom Foran, The Significance of Being Frank: The Life and Times of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, (Kindle Locations 4680-4684), Smashwords.com. Lidian Emerson had outlived her husband by more than ten years, and was laid to rest beside him in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Reverse of Gravestone of Lidian Jackson Emerson, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery Significance Near the end of his own life, Frank Sanborn described Mrs. Emerson as \\"a stately, devoted, independent person\\", with \\"the air... of a lady abbess, relieved of the care of her cloister, and given up to her garden, her reforms, and her unceasing hospitalities.\\"Sanborn, F.B. Recollections of Seventy Years, Vol. 2, Boston, Richard G. Badger, the Gorham Press, 1909, p. 482. In Ellen Emerson's biography of her mother, she states that as time went on, \\"More and more tributes to her charms kept coming to my ears\\" including statements that Mr. Emerson might have been a different man, had Lidian not been his wife, and that \\"she is quite as wonderful as he.\\"Emerson, Ellen Tucker, The Life of Lidian Jackson Emerson, edited by Delores Bird Carpenter, Michigan State University, 1992, p. 155.

Ya'arab bin Bel'arab declared himself regent during the minority of his cousin. In May 1722 Ya'arab took the next step and proclaimed himself Imam. This caused an uprising led by Bel'arab bin Nasir, a relative by marriage of the deposed Imam. After some skirmishes, Ya'arab bin Bel'arab was defeated at Nizwa and the young Saif bin Sultan II was again declared Imam, this time with Bela'rab bin Nasir as regent. Mohammed bin Nasir was among the notables who came to Rustaq to congratulate him. For some reason, Bel'arab bin Nasir picked a quarrel with Mohammed bin Nasir, who took steps to organize a rebellion in alliance with the former Imam Ya'arab bin Bel'arab.

It is located in the town of Florø. It is the main church for the Kinn parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1882 by the architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. The church seats about 500 people. The church was consecrated on 8 November 1882 by the bishop Fredrik W. Hvoslef. History For the first 22 years after Florø was designated as a ladested (town) in 1860, it had no church. It was probably the only town in the country without a church of its own. The townspeople had to undertake the long long sea voyage to the old Kinn Church on the island of Kinn to be able to attend church services. The church issue was a recurrent topic in the Florø town council every year after 1860. In 1882, the church was finally completed in the town, and it became the main church for the parish, with the old Kinn Church being taken out of regular service. Building Florø Church is a big church built with a high nave. On either side wall there are five big windows with pointed gables. The chancel is pentagonal with three big windows. All the stained-glass windows are framed in lead. There are two vestries, one for the vicar and one reserved for babies to be christened. The church had an organ for the consecration ceremony in 1882, and this was one of the first organs in the region of Sunnfjord. The colours in the church are in various shades of grey, repainted in 1999. At the same time the pews were repaired and fitted with cushions. Two rows of pews at the back of the nave have been removed to make space for various exhibits, and also to provide a meeting place for \\"church coffee\\" functions. There were no stoves when the church was new, but they were installed five years later in 1887. Only in 1965 did the church get electric heating.

After the Kennedy inauguration, Frost had \\"high hopes\\" of finishing the collection of poems he had been promising Holt for the past several years.

He held power briefly in 1719–1720 before being deposed and murdered. Background Rustaq fort Muhanna bin Sultan was a younger brother of the great Imam Saif bin Sultan (r. 1692–1711). He was the great-uncle of Saif bin Sultan II, the eldest son of Sultan bin Saif II (r. 1611–1718). Saif bin Sultan II was aged twelve when his father died in 1718. In theory the office of Imam was elected, but in practice for many years it had been inherited by members of the Ya'Aruba family. Saif bin Sultan II was therefore seen as the natural successor to his father. However, there was support for appointing Muhenna as regent during Saif's minority. An assembly of Sheikhs and other notable people was convened at Rustaq, where the Kadhi Adey bin Suliman was persuaded to proclaim Saif bin Sultan II the Imam, albeit reluctantly. Although Saif was popular among the people, the ulama considered he was too young to hold office and favored Muhanna as Imam. Muhanna was well-qualified since he was learned, wise and careful in his decisions. Reign Muhanna bin Sultan was apparently elected Imam by the ulama in May 1719 in the citadel at Nizwa. The ulama had not first obtained tribal consensus, as was customary. Around the end of 1719 Muhanna's supporters smuggled him into the castle at Rustaq and recognized him as Imam. Muhanna proved to be a sensible ruler, careful to consult the religious leaders over any decisions. He abolished the tariffs in the port of Muscat, which caused trade to double and the economy to flourish. In 1720 a squadron of ships from Muscat defeated a squadron of Portuguese transports that was on its way to pick up Persian troops for an attempt to regain the Persian Gulf islands held by the Arabs of Muscat. Deposition and death However, the public still favored Saif bin Sultan II, and were stirred up by Ya'Arab bin Bel'Arab, his cousin. Ya'Arab raised forces and marched on Muscat, which he took. He then turned towards Rustaq. As he advanced, Muhanna's supported deserted him. Muhanna tried to find safety in the fort at Rustaq. He was offered protection if he left. When he accepted, he was captured, thrown in prison and then murdered. He died around the end of 1720. This began a period of violent tribal hostilities. Ya'Arab bin Bel'Arab re-installed Saif bin Sultan II and declared himself regent during the minority of his cousin. In May 1722 Ya'Arab took the next step and proclaimed himself Imam.

(very high-resolution expandable photo) Amarna letter EA 252, titled: Sparing One's Enemies,Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters. EA 252, Sparing One's Enemies, pp. 305-306. is a square, mostly flat clay tablet letter written on both sides, and the bottom edge. Each text line was written with a horizontal line scribed below the text line, as well as a vertical left margin-line, (beginning of text at left) scribe line on the obverse of the tablet. The letter contains 14 (15) lines on the obverse, continuing on the bottom tablet edge to conclude at line 31 on the reverse, leaving a small space before the final tablet edge. At least 4 lines from the obverse intrude into the text of the reverse (appearing as upside-down cuneiform into the text of the reverse), actually dividing the reverse into a top half and bottom half, and even creating a natural spacing segue to the reverse's text, and the story. Letter EA 252 is authored by Labaya, by the 'Man, city-state' (of) Šakmu (Shechem today), and written to the Pharaoh. The letter is one of three letters authored by him, to the Pharaoh. The Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 20–25 years later, correspondence. The initial corpus of letters were found at Akhenaten's city Akhetaten, in the floor of the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh; others were later found, adding to the body of letters. Brief letter summary The topic of the letter is Labaya's defense against other governors of city-states that he is engaged with. A town and statue were taken, and he defends his then follow-up actions of pursuit, to the pharaoh's commissioner. He states: \\"my parts are eaten/ I'm being slandered\\". The exact quote is \\"...he has slandered me, (and/ u), I am slandered-(ši-ir-ti).\\" Directly next, an allegory, lines 16-19, follows concerning \\"a pinched ant- defending itself\\". Basically, if an ant is attacked, should it just sit quiet, or defend against the \\"hand of the man\\" that attacks? Labaya then explains his justification for pursuing the men in warfare (Akkadian nukurtu, nu-KÚR-te, (last syllable most variable in spellings)),Parpola, 197l.

Soon after settling in Buenos Aires, Santana began to hold Council positions in the city, serving as regidor in 1589, and lieutenant governor for 1595. Then he held the position of faithful executor, and served as alcalde of first vote of Buenos Aires in 1592 and 1618. Like all the founding neighbors, Anton Higueras de Santana had received land grants. He owned a ranch located in the town of Las Conchas (Buenos Aires Province). He had two natural daughters, one of them was Beatriz Morena de Santana (wife of Francisco Rodriguez).

It is often presented as the intersection between three contributing, component circles: that of Scrum (with its standard roles and responsibilities, its principles of iterative design and sprints, and of making work visible), of object-oriented architecture (emphasizing modularity of components, the interface/contract- first rather than contract-last approach to design, as borrowed from web programming, etc.), and of concepts from extreme programming (XP), a software development methodology, extended to engineering (including use of user stories, \\"pairing and swarming\\" work patterns, and ideas from test driven development). The framework also generally applies principles of behavior- driven development. The name was coined in 2012 by Joe Justice, founder of Wikispeed, and Marcin Jakubowski, founder of Open Source Ecology, as a take- off of the name extreme programming (XP), a software development methodology. The XM framework, popularized by Justice and J.J. Sutherland, has a rich history, with origins that relate to the Japanese concept of a Kaizen or \\"improvement\\" business culture, and which predate the early implementations of agile software development.  Origins  Getting Started at Agile DC 2013. XM has its origins in the intersection between several fields of study, namely Agile Project Management, Engineering (e.g. Mechanical, Materials, etc.), and Knowledge Management. The name was coined in 2012 after Extreme Programming (XP) software development by Joe Justice, founder of Wikispeed, and Marcin Jakubowski, founder of Open Source Ecology. Alt URL In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka wrote an HBR article on Scrum, entitled \\"New New Product Development Game,\\"[subscription][subscription] a treatment considered seminal. This work challenged the business community to adopt a more holistic approach toward achieving goals; now Scrum is considered a best practice in project management. As Nonaka and Takeuchi progressed in their careers, they continued to collaborate and wrote The Knowledge Creating Company. XM leverages a Takeuchi and Nonaka tenet, that the \\"most powerful learning comes from direct experience\\" and that \\"managers in Japan emphasize the importance of learning from direct experience.\\"  Concept  XM uses a prioritized product backlog as the primary work input queue, where work is visualized in an open area generally on a single team Kanban Board. Every XM team has a Scrum Master and also a Product Owner, who together with the team help to ensure that Agile/Lean principles are followed. In XM the Scrum Master has some critical responsibilities, including to: * communicate with the product owner, * identify and remove impediments, * ensure test driven development (TDD) principles are followed, and * manage team WIP limits, which may vary with team size. The product owner represents the customer, and provides the overall vision and must serve as the product expert. The Agile Software Development Actors found in Agile and Scrum are present in XM. XM does not require, but does encourage TDD. Ideally, XM should adhere to the 10 Principles of XM outlined by Peter Stevens: #Optimize for change, #Object-oriented, Modular Architecture, #Test Driven Development. #Contract-First Design, #Iterate the Design, #Agile Hardware Design Patterns, #Continuous integration Development, #Continuous Deployment Development, #Scaling Patterns, and #Partner Patterns. According to Stevens, these \\"principles and patterns do not represent the final wisdom on Agile manufacturing, but rather a work-in-progress… [toward] the discovery of better ways to manufacture things.\\"  Contemporary interests  Team Wikispeed and Agile DC conference attendees celebrating success. A number of prototype cars have been developed by separate companies using the XM process. In 2008, in response to the Automotive X Prize sponsored by Progressive Insurance—a $10 million prize aimed rewarding the design and construction of a car capable of fuel efficiency at the 100 miles per gallon (m.p.g.) mark, while achieving \\"road-legal safety specifications\\"[subscription][subscription]—Joe Justice and team Wikispeed, composed of 44 members from 4 countries, used XM to achieve what Fortune magazine called the \\"seemingly impossible:\\" application of tools formerly largely devoted to software manufacturing, to the development of a functional automotive prototype in three months time. Even more remarkable than the 100 m.p.g. car was an impressive rate of acceleration: from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in less than 5 seconds. The success—finishing 10th in the mainstream class, and \\"outrunning more than one hundred other cars from well-funded companies and universities around the world\\"— led to an invitation to team Wikispeed to showcase their prototype at the Detroit auto show. Companies use XM as a way to challenge their employees to develop new skills and learn the power of teamwork to solve complex problems. For example, in 2013, Lockheed Martin (Sunnyvale, CA) challenged 200 of its engineers to build a 100 m.p.g. car in a single day; the challenge was met and the team's car was sold for $25,000. Another such example is opensourceecology.org, whose Global Village Construction Set is developing and building affordable industrial machines, and publishing the designs on-line for free.

Mu kratha resembles a combination of a Korean barbecue and a Chinese hot pot. It is believed to have originated from the Korean barbecue grill. The Thai version uses charcoal. The dining concept spread throughout Thailand and into Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Preparation and serving Sliced meat (most often pork) is grilled on the dome in the centre while the vegetables and other ingredients, such as fish balls, cook in the soup (also called Thai suki). The hot pot sits on a pail of burning charcoal which grills or boils the food. The best foods for this cooking method are pork, chicken, mutton, lamb, seafood, vegetables, and mushrooms. The local traditional Thai mu kratha is usually served with nam chim suki, a popular dipping sauce. It is well known for using chili sauce as the main ingredient. Some restaurants serve nam chim seafood to accompany seafood. When cooking mu kratha, a chunk of fat is commonly grilled at the apex of the pan so its grease prevents food from sticking. In popular culture Thailand has many mu kratha restaurants as it is easy to prepare and suits a variety of foods. In the past it lost its popularity due to concerns about hygiene, but experienced a comeback in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.

David Ross, Modern Pioneer: A Biography. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1946. Print. was a Purdue University graduate who helped advance the university through his generous donations and years of service on the Board of Trustees. Early life David E. Ross was the second child of George Ross and Susanna Booth. He was born in Lafayette, Indiana, but moved to Brookston at the age of two. In 1876, Ross began attending primary school. During this time in his life, Ross began to show an interest in engineering. While on a steamboat ride with his parents, Ross made his way to the engine room and became fascinated with the machinery. Another incident occurred at his uncle's house when Ross attempted to manipulate the furnace. During his senior year of high school, Ross decided to attend college and learn about engineering. Despite his father’s disapproval, Ross enrolled in Purdue University in 1889.Cooperider, Jay. \\"David Ross Ingenious and generous, he enriched the University in countless ways.\\" Tippecanoe County, Indiana; accessed October 31, 2013. This decision was made possible thanks to another uncle, Will, who offered to house Ross during his time in college and pay for books and tuition. College In 1893, Ross graduated from Purdue as a mechanical engineer.Cullen, Kevin. \\"Discoveries: The many facets of Purdue legend David Ross.\\" Journal and Courier, February 7, 2012. His life at college was “quiet”. Despite his inventive mind, he received only a passing grade in most of his classes, including machine design, mathematics, and physics. Life after college Around 1905, Ross invented his first automotive steering gear. He eventually patented 88 inventions and was involved in founding four companies related to building materials and automotive mechanisms. Purdue University Ross became a member of the Purdue Alumni Committee in 1921. His first project involved raising money to build the Purdue Memorial Union that would honor Purdue graduates that died during World War I. After donating a large contribution of his own, Ross began persuading alumni in the area to donate as well. He would promise them the building would be “the finest thing of the kind in the United States”. Partially because of his persistence, alumni donated almost half of the one million dollars that paid for the Union. Purdue Memorial Union Ross’s next project was the design of a new football stadium to help promote the athletics of the school. He met with George Ade, another well-known Purdue graduate, on a 65-acre farm and proposed the financing of the new stadium. The two men became business partners and friends, and funded what came to be called the Ross–Ade Stadium. Ross also helped build the Lambert Fieldhouse by donating $100,000 and land. Ross became president of the Purdue Board of Trustees in 1927. With his new role, he was able to push for the creation of the Purdue Research Foundation, which was successfully founded in 1930. He personally donated $25,000 towards its formation. He believed research was an essential part of the learning process and led to innovation and discovery. This belief in the power of research led to $453,00 of fellowship funds from 1930-40. Ross was also a believer in the need for aeronautical engineering at Purdue. He bought 157 acres of land that would eventually grant Purdue the distinction of having one of the country’s first operational airports. Later life=Death Ross died on June 28, 1943. He is buried northwest of the Slayter Center of Performing Arts, on a piece of land overlooking the main campus of Purdue University that he had donated as part of the Purdue Research Foundation. He is one of four people buried on campus, the others being John Purdue, and Steven and Jane Beering. Ross was quoted as saying “I’m hoping the time may never come when I’m not identified with Purdue”. Most of Ross’s estate was left to the Purdue Research Foundation. The sum total of money, stocks, and land that Ross donated to the university. amounted to nearly $3,000,000 dollars.

(commonly known as SoFi) is an American online personal finance company. Based in San Francisco, SoFi provides student loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans, investing and banking. History=2011–13 SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested an average of $20,000 to 100 students. In September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million, led by Baseline Ventures, with participation from DCM and Renren. Additional investors included Ron Suber.https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/05/18/to-get-ahead- in-fintech-you-need-to-be-in-touch.html On October 2, 2013, SoFi announced that it had raised $500 million in debt and equity to fund and refinance student loans. This total funding amount came from $90 million in equity, $151 million in debt, and $200 million in bank participations, with the remaining capital from alumni and community investors. The $151 million in debt includes a $60 million line of credit from Morgan Stanley, and a $41 million line of credit from Bancorp. As of September 2013, SoFi had funded $200 million in loans to 2500 borrowers at the company's 100 eligible schools. In November 2013, SoFi announced a deal with Barclays and Morgan Stanley to create a bond backed by peer-to-peer student loans, and this would create the first securitization of these loans to receive a credit rating. 2014–18 In April 2014, SoFi raised $80 million in a Series C round led by Discovery Capital Management with participation from Peter Thiel, Wicklow Capital, and existing investors. Money was raised to expand the footprint of the company's student loan refinancing business and to extend into new products like mortgages and personal loans. In February 2015, the company announced a $200 million funding round led by Third Point Management. That same month, the company officially began offering personal loans. By March 2015, the company was offering mortgages in more than 20 states, up from its initial launch that included under ten states in October, 2014. By April 2015, the company had funded more than $2 billion in loans, including student loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans and MBA loans. To celebrate its $2 billion milestone, SoFi announced a contest, #2BillionTogether, to pay off one of its members student loans. In September 2015, Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt was added as an advisor. The firm also raised a $1 billion round of investment from SoftBank and said it had funded $4 billion in loans. In May 2016, SoFi became the first startup online lender to receive a triple-A rating from Moody's. In September 2016, SoFi launched SoFi at Work, an employee benefit program to reduce student debt and build financial wellness, and announced it has more than 600 corporate partners. As of October 2016, SoFi has funded more than $12 billion in total loan volume and has 175,000 members. In February 2017, it was announced that Social Finance Inc. raised an additional $500 million from an investor group led by Silver Lake, and also including SoftBank, to help support global expansion. On September 11, 2017, Chief Executive Mike Cagney announced he would resign by the end of year due to allegations of sexual harassment and skirting risk and compliance controls. Announced January 23, 2018, Anthony Noto resigned from his position as COO of Twitter, to become the CEO of Social Finance. In April 2018, SoFi announced that Michelle Gil, who previously worked at TPG and Goldman Sachs, was joining the company as Chief Financial Officer. In October 2018, SoFi settled FTC charges, agreeing to stop making false claims about savings from student loan refinancing. The FTC alleged that SoFi had been making such false claims since April 2016. In February 2019, the FTC announced its approval of the final consent order under which SoFI is prohibited from misrepresenting to consumers how much money consumers will save or have saved using its products and from making any claims about any such savings unless the claims are backed up with reliable evidence. The order expires on February 22, 2039, or 20 years from the Commission's most recent date of filing a complaint in federal court reporting any misconduct that occurs later.  2019  In May 2019, SoFi closed $500 million in a single funding round led by Qatar Investment Authority. In September 2019, SoFi inked a 20-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) for the naming rights to SoFi Stadium, in Inglewood, California. The deal, which is worth $30 million annually, is a record for any naming rights for a sports venue. 2020 In April 2020, SoFi acquired Salt Lake City payments firm Galileo for $1.2 billion in stock and cash, and Hong Kong-based investment app 8 Securities. Model SoFi originally utilized an alumni-funded lending model that connected students and recent graduates with alumni and institutional investors via school specific student loan funds. Investors received a financial return and borrowers received rates lower than the federal government offered. The company sought to minimize defaults by focusing on low-risk students and graduates. As SoFi's product offerings expanded to include mortgages, mortgage refinancing and personal loans, the company moved away from an alumni-funded model to a non-traditional underwriting approach focused on lending to financially responsible individuals. SoFi uses an underwriting model that examines free cash flow, professional history and education in addition to a history of responsible bill payment to evaluate its borrowers. They also offer cash management (checking) accounts and an investment platform that includes brokerage and robo-advisor services.

These drugs cross the BBB and deliver pharmaceuticals to the brain for therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders. These disorders include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and brain tumors. Part of the difficulty in finding cures for these central nervous system (CNS) disorders is that there is yet no truly efficient delivery method for drugs to cross the BBB. Antibiotics, antineoplastic agents, and a variety of CNS-active drugs, especially neuropeptides, are a few examples of molecules that cannot pass the BBB alone. With the aid of nanoparticle delivery systems, however, studies have shown that some drugs can now cross the BBB, and even exhibit lower toxicity and decrease adverse effects throughout the body. Toxicity is an important concept for pharmacology because high toxicity levels in the body could be detrimental to the patient by affecting other organs and disrupting their function. Further, the BBB is not the only physiological barrier for drug delivery to the brain. Other biological factors influence how drugs are transported throughout the body and how they target specific locations for action. Some of these pathophysiological factors include blood flow alterations, edema and increased intracranial pressure, metabolic perturbations, and altered gene expression and protein synthesis. Though there exist many obstacles that make developing a robust delivery system difficult, nanoparticles provide a promising mechanism for drug transport to the CNS.  Background  The first successful delivery of a drug across the BBB occurred in 1995. The drug used was hexapeptide dalargin, an anti-nociceptive peptide that cannot cross the BBB alone. It was encapsulated in polysorbate 80 coated nanoparticles and intravenously injected. This was a huge breakthrough in the nanoparticle drug delivery field, and it helped advance research and development toward clinical trials of nanoparticle delivery systems. Nanoparticles range in size from 10 - 1000 nm (or 1 µm) and they can be made from natural or artificial polymers, lipids, dendrimers, and micelles. Most polymers used for nanoparticle drug delivery systems are natural, biocompatible, and biodegradable, which helps prevent contamination in the CNS. Several current methods for drug delivery to the brain include the use of liposomes, prodrugs, and carrier-mediated transporters. Many different delivery methods exist to transport these drugs into the body, such as peroral, intranasal, intravenous, and intracranial. For nanoparticles, most studies have shown increasing progression with intravenous delivery. Along with delivery and transport methods, there are several means of functionalizing, or activating, the nanoparticle carriers. These means include dissolving or absorbing a drug throughout the nanoparticle, encapsulating a drug inside the particle, or attaching a drug on the surface of the particle.  Types of nanoparticles for CNS drug delivery = Lipid-based  Diagram of liposome showing a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous interior. One type of nanoparticle involves use of liposomes as drug molecule carriers. The diagram on the right shows a standard liposome. It has a phospholipid bilayer separating the interior from the exterior of the cell. Liposomes are composed of vesicular bilayers, lamellae, made of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids such as sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and glycerophospholipids. Cholesterol, a type of lipid, is also often incorporated in the lipid-nanoparticle formulation. Cholesterol can increase stability of a liposome and prevent leakage of a bilayer because its hydroxyl group can interact with the polar heads of the bilayer phospholipids. Liposomes have the potential to protect the drug from degradation, target sites for action, and reduce toxicity and adverse effects. Lipid nanoparticles can be manufactured by high pressure homogenization, a current method used to produce parenteral emulsions. This process can ultimately form a uniform dispersion of small droplets in a fluid substance by subdividing particles until the desired consistency is acquired. This manufacturing process is already scaled and in use in the food industry, which therefore makes it more appealing for researchers and for the drug delivery industry. Liposomes can also be functionalized by attaching various ligands on the surface to enhance brain- targeted delivery.  Cationic liposomes  Another type of lipid- nanoparticle that can be used for drug delivery to the brain is a cationic liposome. These are lipid molecules that are positively charged. One example of cationic liposomes uses bolaamphiphiles, which contain hydrophilic groups surrounding a hydrophobic chain to strengthen the boundary of the nano-vesicle containing the drug. Bolaamphiphile nano-vesicles can cross the BBB, and they allow controlled release of the drug to target sites. Lipoplexes can also be formed from cationic liposomes and DNA solutions, to yield transfection agents. Cationic liposomes cross the BBB through adsorption mediated endocytosis followed by internalization in the endosomes of the endothelial cells. By transfection of endothelial cells through the use of lipoplexes, physical alterations in the cells could be made. These physical changes could potentially improve how some nanoparticle drug-carriers cross the BBB.  Metallic  Metal nanoparticles are promising as carriers for drug delivery to the brain. Common metals used for nanoparticle drug delivery are gold, silver, and platinum, owing to their biocompatibility. These metallic nanoparticles are used due to their large surface area to volume ratio, geometric and chemical tunability, and endogenous antimicrobial properties. Silver cations released from silver nanoparticles can bind to the negatively charged cellular membrane of bacteria and increase membrane permeability, allowing foreign chemicals to enter the intracellular fluid. Metal nanoparticles are chemically synthesized using reduction reactions. For example, drug-conjugated silver nanoparticles are created by reducing silver nitrate with sodium borohydride in the presence of an ionic drug compound. The drug binds to the surface of the silver, stabilizing the nanoparticles and preventing the nanoparticles from aggregation. Metallic nanoparticles typically cross the BBB via transcytosis. Nanoparticle delivery through the BBB can be increased by introducing peptide conjugates to improve permeability to the central nervous system. For instance, recent studies have shown an improvement in gold nanoparticle delivery efficiency by conjugating a peptide that binds to the transferrin receptors expressed in brain endothelial cells.  Solid lipid  Diagram displays a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN). There is only one phospholipid layer because the interior of the particle is solid. Molecules such as antibodies, targeting peptides, and drug molecules can be bound to the surface of the SLN. Also, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are lipid nanoparticles with a solid interior as shown in the diagram on the right. SLNs can be made by replacing the liquid lipid oil used in the emulsion process with a solid lipid. In solid lipid nanoparticles, the drug molecules are dissolved in the particle's solid hydrophobic lipid core, this is called the drug payload, and it is surrounded by an aqueous solution. Many SLNs are developed from triglycerides, fatty acids, and waxes. High-pressure homogenization or micro-emulsification can be used for manufacturing. Further, functionalizing the surface of solid lipid nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) can result in increased BBB permeability. Different colloidal carriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and emulsions have reduced stability, shelf life and encapsulation efficacy. Solid lipid nanoparticles are designed to overcome these shortcomings and have an excellent drug release and physical stability apart from targeted delivery of drugs.  Nanoemulsions  Another form for nanoparticle delivery systems is oil-in-water emulsions done on a nano-scale. This process uses common biocompatible oils such as triglycerides and fatty acids, and combines them with water and surface-coating surfactants. Oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids especially contain important factors that aid in penetrating the tight junctions of the BBB.  Polymer-based  Other nanoparticles are polymer- based, meaning they are made from a natural polymer such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly D,L-glycolide (PLG), polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), and polycyanoacrylate (PCA). Some studies have found that polymeric nanoparticles may provide better results for drug delivery relative to lipid-based nanoparticles because they may increase the stability of the drugs or proteins being transported. Polymeric nanoparticles may also contain beneficial controlled release mechanisms. Polymer Branch Nanoparticles made from natural polymers that are biodegradable have the abilities to target specific organs and tissues in the body, to carry DNA for gene therapy, and to deliver larger molecules such as proteins, peptides, and even genes. To manufacture these polymeric nanoparticles, the drug molecules are first dissolved and then encapsulated or attached to a polymer nanoparticle matrix. Three different structures can then be obtained from this process; nanoparticles, nanocapsules (in which the drug is encapsulated and surrounded by the polymer matrix), and nanospheres (in which the drug is dispersed throughout the polymeric matrix in a spherical form). One of the most important traits for nanoparticle delivery systems is that they must be biodegradable on the scale of a few days. A few common polymer materials used for drug delivery studies are polybutyl cyanoacrylate (PBCA), poly(isohexyl cyanoacrylate) (PIHCA), polylactic acid (PLA), or polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA). PBCA undergoes degradation through enzymatic cleavage of its ester bond on the alkyl side chain to produce water- soluble byproducts. PBCA also proves to be the fastest biodegradable material, with studies showing 80% reduction after 24 hours post intravenous therapy injection. PIHCA, however, was recently found to display an even lower degradation rate, which in turn further decreases toxicity. PIHCA, due to this slight advantage, is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials for transporting the drug doxorubicin as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinomas. Human serum albumin (HSA) and chitosan are also materials of interest for the generation of nanoparticle delivery systems. Using albumin nanoparticles for stroke therapy can overcome numerous limitations. For instance, albumin nanoparticles can enhance BBB permeability, increase solubility, and increase half-life in circulation. Patients who suffer from brain cancer overexpress albumin-binding proteins, such as SPARC and gp60, in their BBB and tumor cells, naturally increasing the uptake of albumin into the brain. Using this relationship, researches have formed albumin nanoparticles that co-encapsulate two anticancer drugs, paclitaxel and fenretinide, modified with low weight molecular protamine (LMWP), a type of cell-penetrating protein, for anti-glioma therapy. Once injected into the patient’s body, the albumin nanoparticles can cross the BBB more easily, bind to the proteins and penetrate glioma cells, and then release the contained drugs. This nanoparticle formulation enhances tumor-targeting delivery efficiency and improves the solubility issue of hydrophobic drugs. Specifically, cationic bovine serum albumin-conjugated tanshinone IIA PEGylated nanoparticles injected into a MCAO rat model decreased the volume of infarction and neuronal apoptosis. Chitosan, a naturally abundant polysaccharide, is particularly useful due to its biocompability and lack of toxicity. With its adsorptive and mucoadhesive properties, chitosan can overcome limitations of internasal administration to the brain. It has been shown that cationic chitosan nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged brain endothelium. Coating these polymeric nanoparticle devices with different surfactants can also aid BBB crossing and uptake in the brain. Surfactants such as polysorbate 80, 20, 40, 60, and poloxamer 188, demonstrated positive drug delivery through the blood–brain barrier, whereas other surfactants did not yield the same results. It has also been shown that functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG), can induce the \\"stealth effect\\", allowing the drug- loaded nanoparticle to circulate throughout the body for prolonged periods of time. Further, the stealth effect, caused in part by the hydrophilic and flexible properties of the PEG chains, facilitates an increase in localizing the drug at target sites in tissues and organs.  Mechanisms for delivery = Liposomes  A mechanism for liposome transport across the BBB is lipid- mediated free diffusion, a type of facilitated diffusion, or lipid-mediated endocytosis. There exist many lipoprotein receptors which bind lipoproteins to form complexes that in turn transport the liposome nano-delivery system across the BBB. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a protein that facilitates transport of lipids and cholesterol. ApoE constituents bind to nanoparticles, and then this complex binds to a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the BBB and allows transport to occur. This diagram shows several ways in which transport across the BBB works. For nanoparticle delivery across the BBB, the most common mechanisms are receptor-mediated transcytosis and adsorptive transcytosis  Polymeric nanoparticles  The mechanism for the transport of polymer-based nanoparticles across the BBB has been characterized as receptor-mediated endocytosis by the brain capillary endothelial cells. Transcytosis then occurs to transport the nanoparticles across the tight junction of endothelial cells and into the brain. Surface coating nanoparticles with surfactants such as polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 was shown to increase uptake of the drug into the brain also. This mechanism also relies on certain receptors located on the luminal surface of endothelial cells of the BBB. Ligands coated on the nanoparticle's surface bind to specific receptors to cause a conformational change. Once bound to these receptors, transcytosis can commence, and this involves the formation of vesicles from the plasma membrane pinching off the nanoparticle system after internalization. Additional receptors identified for receptor-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticle delivery systems are the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), LDL receptor (LRP1), transferrin receptor, and insulin receptor. As long as a receptor exists on the endothelial surface of the BBB, any ligand can be attached to the nanoparticle's surface to functionalize it so that it can bind and undergo endocytosis. Another mechanism is adsorption mediated transcytosis, where electrostatic interactions are involved in mediating nanoparticle crossing of the BBB. Cationic nanoparticles (including cationic liposomes) are of interest for this mechanism, because their positive charges assist binding on the brain's endothelial cells. Using TAT-peptides, a cell-penetrating peptide, to functionalize the surface of cationic nanoparticles can further improve drug transport into the brain.  Magnetic and Magnetoelectric nanoparticles  In contrast to the above mechanisms, a delivery with magnetic fields doesn't strongly depend on the biochemistry of the brain. In this case, nanoparticles are literally pulled across the BBB via application of a magnetic field gradient. The nanoparticles can be pulled in as well as removed from the brain merely by controlling the direction of the gradient. For the approach to work, the nanoparticles must have a non-zero magnetic moment and have a diameter of less than 50 nm. Both magnetic and magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) satisfy the requirements. However, it is only the MENs which display a non-zero magnetoelectric (ME) effect. Due to the ME effect, MENs can provide a direct access to local intrinsic electric fields at the nanoscale to enable a two-way communication with the neural network at the single-neuron level. MENs, proposed by the research group of Professor Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU), have been used for targeted drug delivery and externally controlled release across the BBB to treat HIV and brain tumors, as well as to wirelessly stimulate neurons deep in the brain for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and others.  Focused ultrasound  Studies have shown that focused ultrasound bursts can noninvasively be used to disrupt tight junctions in desired locations of BBB, allowing for the increased passage of particles at that location. This disruption can last up to four hours after burst administration. Focused ultrasound works by generating oscillating microbubbles, which physically interact with the cells of the BBB by oscillating at a frequency which can be tuned by the ultrasound burst. This physical interaction is believed to cause cavitation and ultimately the disintegration of the tight junction complexes which may explain why this effect lasts for several hours. However, the energy applied from ultrasound can result in tissue damage. Fortunately, studies have demonstrated that this risk can be reduced if preformed microbubbles are first injected before focused ultrasound is applied, reducing the energy required from the ultrasound. This technique has applications in the treatment of various diseases. For example, one study has shown that using focused ultrasound with oscillating bubbles loaded with a chemotherapeutic drug, carmustine, facilitates the safe treatment of glioblastoma in an animal model. This drug, like many others, normally requires large dosages to reach the target brain tissue diffusion from the blood, leading to systemic toxicity and the possibilities of multiple harmful side effects manifesting throughout the body. However, focused ultrasound has the potential to increase the safety and efficacy of drug delivery to the brain.  Toxicity  A study was performed to assess the toxicity effects of doxorubicin-loaded polymeric nanoparticle systems. It was found that doses up to 400 mg/kg of PBCA nanoparticles alone did not cause any toxic effects on the organism. These low toxicity effects can most likely be attributed to the controlled release and modified biodistribution of the drug due to the traits of the nanoparticle delivery system. Toxicity is a highly important factor and limit of drug delivery studies, and a major area of interest in research on nanoparticle delivery to the brain. Metal nanoparticles are associated with risks of neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity. These heavy metals generate reactive oxygen species, which causes oxidative stress and damages the cells’ mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.Sintov, A., Velasco-Aguirre, C., Gallardo-Toledo, E., Araya, E., & Kogan, M. (2016). Metal Nanoparticles as Targeted Carriers Circumventing the Blood–Brain Barrier. International Review of Neurobiology Nanotechnology and the Brain, 199-227. doi:10.1016/bs.irn.2016.06.007 This leads to further issues in cellular toxicity, such as damage to DNA and disruption of cellular pathways. Silver nanoparticles in particular have a higher degree of toxicity compared to other metal nanoparticles such as gold or iron.Bahadar, H., Maqbool, F., Niaz, K., & Abdollahi, M. (2016). Toxicity of Nanoparticles and an Overview of Current Experimental Models. Toxicity of Nanoparticles and an Overview of Current Experimental Models. doi:10.7508/ibj.2016.01.001 Silver nanoparticles can circulate through the body and accumulate easily in multiple organs, as discovered in a study on the silver nanoparticle distribution in rats. Traces of silver accumulated in the rats’ lungs, spleen, kidney, liver, and brain after the nanoparticles were injected subcutaneously. In addition, silver nanoparticles generate more reactive oxygen species compared to other metals, which leads to an overall larger issue of toxicity.  Research  In the early 21st century, extensive research is occurring in the field of nanoparticle drug delivery systems to the brain. One of the common diseases being studied in neuroscience today is Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have been done to show how nanoparticles can be used as a platform to deliver therapeutic drugs to these patients suffering from the disease. A few Alzheimer's drugs that have been studied especially are rivastigmine, tacrine, quinoline, piperine, and curcumin. PBCA, chitosan, and PLGA nanoparticles were used as delivery systems for these drugs. Overall, the results from each drug injection with these nanoparticles showed remarkable improvements in the effects of the drug relative to non-nanoparticle delivery systems. This possibly suggests that nanoparticles could provide a promising solution to how these drugs could cross the BBB. One factor that still must be considered and accounted for is nanoparticle accumulation in the body. With long-term and frequent injections that are often required to treat chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, polymeric nanoparticles could potentially build up in the body, causing undesirable effects. This area for concern would have to be further assessed to analyze these possible effects and to improve them.

Traditionally, a bar or bat mitzvah occurs at age 13 for boys and 12 for girls. However, many adult Jews who have never had a bar or bat mitzvah choose to have one later in life, and many who have had one at the traditional age choose to have a second. An adult bar or bat mitzvah can be held at any age after adulthood is reached and can be performed in a variety of ways. The adult bar/bat mitzvah, which can be held at any age, differs from the child's bar/bat mitzvah in that it is usually planned by the person themselves instead of their parents. Due to it taking place at an advanced stage of life, many relatives who are often present at a child's bar/bat mitzvah are deceased, and the person is often married and/or has children and sometimes grandchildren. Many men have second bar mitzvahs at the age of 83, representing 70 years since their first.  Reasons  There are many reasons adult Jews choose to have a bar or bat mitzvah: * Many adult women didn't have a bat mitzvah as children due to lack of popularity. * Some adults who have learning disabilities may have \\"failed\\" Hebrew school and/or were emotionally unstable and couldn't handle the stress involved with becoming a bar or bat mitzvah, and decided to wait until adulthood. * Adults who have converted to Judaism may want a bar or bat mitzvah. * Many non-religious Jews either had little or no Jewish education as children. * Those who have had a bar or bat mitzvah as children decide to undergo renewal. * Many Holocaust survivors didn't have the opportunity to become a bar or bat mitzvah.  History  Rabbi Albert Axelrad of Brandeis University officiated the first adult bar and bat mitzvahs in the early 1970s. He encouraged the practice in all denominations of Judaism. Between 1995 and 2001, Hadassah held group adult Bat Mitzvah ceremonies for 180 women. In 2001, the Union for Reform Judaism created a guide on adult bar and bat mitzvah programs which was adopted by 900 congregations. In 2002, the Conservative Movement adopted this guide as well.  Process  The process of becoming an bar or bat mitzvah for adults involves studying for a year or longer. It consists of Hebrew language, Jewish rituals, Torah readings, and Haftorah readings. Many synagogues provide classes for adults.  Notable adult bar and bat mitzvahs  * Paula Abdul had an adult bat mitzvah in Safed on November 2, 2013, at the age of 51. She had originally planned to hold it at the Western Wall in Jerusalem but changed her plans due to jet lag and the media circus that would follow. * Armand Hammer died on December 11, 1990, on the evening before his planned bar mitzvah at age 92. * In June 2012, actor David Arquette celebrated his bar mitzvah aged 40 at the Kotel. * In October 2015, actor James Franco celebrated his bar mitzvah aged 37. * Yisrael Kristal held his bar mitzvah at the age of 113. He was the world's oldest living man at the time. * In December 2019, comedian Tiffany Haddish celebrated her Bat Mitzvah aged 40.https://forward.com/culture/435945/susan-silverman-tiffany-haddish-black- mitzvah-q-and-a-sarah-silverman/ In popular culture, there have been depictions of adult bar mitzvahs on TV shows: * An episode during the last season of The Dick Van Dyke Show depicts Buddy having his bar mitzvah, having been too poor to have one as a boy. * The Simpsons episode \\"Today I Am a Clown\\" depicts Krusty the Klown having a bar mitzvah.

Constructed in 1890, the dam was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.Oregon National Register List, page 11 The Winchester Dam was made from large timber cribs. Originally, the dam was a mere four feet high, which was raised to sixteen feet in 1907. The dam was the main source of water and electricity for the town of Roseburg until 1923. The dam's hydropower facilities have long since been removed, and the structure is now maintained solely for the recreational benefit of the Winchester Water Control District, composed of the private landowners surrounding the reservoir pool.https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/ec88eb6d-93ef-4c39-ac23-5eaaa374142f  Public Safety  The dam is officially categorized as “high hazard” by the Oregon Department of Water Resources, primarily due to likely loss of life in the case of dam failure among the people who frequent the river, parks, and boat ramps just downstream. Following an annual inspection in October 2019, state officials downgraded Winchester Dam’s condition to “poor,” requested that the owners hire an engineer to comprehensively inspect its structure, and warned the owners to address known dam safety issues soon. According to the 2019 inspection report, Winchester Dam has not received a comprehensive structural inspection, nor have the owners updated the dam's required emergency action plan, since 1987.  Drinking Water Impacts  In January 2020, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality levied a $58,378 fine for violations during a repair at Winchester Dam in late 2018. According to DEQ, pollution from this repair degraded aquatic habitat, killed numerous fish, and harmed the primary drinking water source for the City of Roseburg and the Umpqua Basin Water Association – serving approximately 37,700 people combined. Officials found that dam repairs were conducted without following established best management practices, even after state and federal agencies provided information in advance on how to protect water quality and fish.  Harm to Fish  In 1994, conservation group Oregon Natural Resources Council released a report titled \\"Damnable Dams\\" which called for the removal of a number of Pacific Northwest dams, including Winchester Dam, because of the harm these structures caused to salmon and other fish.http://www.hcn.org/issues/3/88 Since then, other dams on the \\"Damnable Dams\\" list have come down, including Savage Rapidshttp://waterwatch.org/programs/savage-rapids-dam-removal, Elk Creekhttp://www.oregonwild.org/waters/rivers-and-dams/elk-creek-dam/timeline, and Gold Rayhttp://waterwatch.org/gold-ray-dam-comes-down dams in southern Oregon. However, Winchester Dam has remained. In 2013, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife placed Winchester Dam on the Statewide Fish Passage Priority List, an official listing of Oregon's top artificial obstructions to native migratory fish.http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/passage/docs/2013_Statewide_Prioritization_List.pdf In 2019, Winchester Dam was raised to the second highest ranked privately- owned dam on the Statewide Fish Passage Priority List, where it is noted for impeding passage to 160 miles of high quality habitat for spring Chinook, fall Chinook, summer steelhead, winter steelhead, cutthroat trout, and Pacific Lamprey, as well as Southern Oregon Coast Coho which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife staff maintain and operate the Winchester Dam’s fish ladder through an easement providing access, but lack a substantive written system or analysis for maximizing fish passage efficiency at different flows. Winchester’s ladder has a number of right angle turns and the ability to control flow velocities in the ladder is limited, making it difficult to pass fish at a wide range of flows. In mid-2019, after the dam owners objected, state officials declined the offer of seventeen conservation and fishing groups to fully fund an aquatic engineer to independently analyze the ladder and create a comprehensive system for maximizing ladder efficiency at different flows. Fish Counting Station Although the fish ladder at Winchester Dam does not meet current federal standards for passing fishhttp://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/fish_passage/ferc_licensing/rogue_umpqua/winchester.html, it has generated information for fishery management decisions since 1945.http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/fish_counts/winchester_dam.asp There is a fish counting station maintained by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife here. At the station, biologists count fish to monitor population, design management methods, and prescribe angling regulations. Since 2015, funding for fish counting at the station has been significantly reduced, and local fishermen have questioned the accuracy of the station's results.http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Steamboat-Whistle- Spring-2017.html?soid=1110504438198&aid;=lG-rhlQeg54 See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Douglas County, Oregon References Category:1890 establishments in Oregon Category:Dams completed in 1890 Category:Dams on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Douglas County, Oregon ","title":"Winchester Dam"},{"id":"41086678","text":"Country Funk 1969–1975 is a compilation album released on July 24, 2012 by Light in the Attic Records.

The northern lake makes up the public Beihai Park while the southern two are grouped together as Zhongnanhai, the headquarters for the Communist leadership of the People's Republic of China. Taiye Lake was immortalized in the early 1410s when the Yongle Emperor commissioned The Eight Views of Beijing (), recording the capital's chief sites in poetry and painting in order to legitimize his removal of the imperial capital away from Nanking. It is best remembered in China today from the scene of \\"Clear Waves at Taiye Lake\\" (, Taiye Qingbo).Whiteman, Stephen. \\"From Upper Camp to Mountain Estate: Recovering Historical Narratives in Qing Imperial Landscapes\\", pp. 14 ff.

Name The literal meaning of the Chinese characters is \\"Great Liquid Pool\\" or \\"Pond\\". Prior to the Taiye Lake watershed system in Beijing that still exists today known as North, Central and South Seas, the name \\"Taiye\\" had honored several lakes in imperial gardens or palaces in various locations that once served as capital cities of imperial China. An early example of Taiye Lake is located in the city of Xi'an. There were two lakes named Taiye existed in Xi'an (known as Chang'an). The earlier Taiye Lake was excavated in Han dynasty by Emperor Wu of Han in the 1st century BC as part of his Jianzhang Palace (, Jiànzhānggōng). This lake, along with the Kunming Lake, was a necessary addition to the city's water supply after the expansion of the capital city under Emperor Wu's reign. The second Taiye Lake in Xi'an was excavated in Tang dynasty by Emperor Taizong next to his father's Daming Palace, after the capital had been relocated several miles northward due to the growing salinity of the water source at the original site. There are older Taiye Lakes in Beijing, too. In 1151, Beijing (known as Zhongdu) became the capital city of Jurchen Jin dynasty. The emperor Wanyan Liang ordered to rebuild Beijing in style of Kaifeng, the former capital city of Song dynasty in the south. During the reconstruction of Beijing, a Taiye Lake was built near the palace of Jurchens. The relic of this Taiye Lake is in today's Xicheng district outside of the southwestern second ring road and roughly near the Guang'an Gate of Beijing in later dynasties. The still-existing Taiye Lakes in Beijing were first created in Yuan dynasty when Mongol's were reconstruct Beijing as Khanbaliq after the previous Beijing city had been seriously damaged during the war between Mongols and Jurchens. History A map of Khanbaliq showing the gardens and three palaces around Taiye Lake, as well as the original three islands. The city walls of Zhongdu and Beijing are also noted. The lake was first constructed as part of the Jinshui River canal systemHou, Eve. \\"Nine Dragons, One River: The Role of Institutions in Developing Water Pricing Policy in Beijing, PRC\\", p. 6. Univ. of British Columbia, 2001. under the Jurchen emperor Zhangzong. Although still within the limits of modern Beijing, the Jurchen capital of Zhongdu was located well south of the site, in a separate watershed. Zhangzong constructed the Daning Palace (t , s , Dànínggōng, lit. \\"Palace of Great Peace\\") beside the new lake in 1179.Rinaldi, Bianca. The Chinese Garden: Garden Types for Contemporary Landscape Architecture, p. 137. Walter de Gruyter, 2011. Accessed 16 November 2013. During the Yuan dynasty, the Mongolian emperors abandoned the ruined site of Zhongdu and its more meager water sources in favor of the Gaoliang watershed. The imperial engineers Liu Bingzhong and Guo Shoujing directed the construction of the new Imperial City of Khanbaliq (Marco Polo's Cambaluc & the Chinese Dadu) around Zhangzong's former palace and Lake Taiye, which was an important part of the capital's water supply.Du Pengfei & al. \\"History of Water Supply in Pre-Modern China\\" from Evolution of Water Supply through the Millennia, pp. 169 ff. Accessed 16 November 2013. The lake was expanded until it covered the area of the present northern and central \\"seas\\" and three palaces were built around it. The purity of the reservoir was protected by law: from its source at a spring on Yuquan Mountain to Lake Taiye, the Jinshui was given separate passes where it crossed other streams and commoners were forbidden to bathe, wash clothes, water livestock, or dump trash along its course.Du Pengfei.

Under the Ming dynasty, construction on the present-day Forbidden City began in AD 1406 as part of the Yongle Emperor's relocation of the capital away from Nanjing. The new palace was south of the former Yuan one and the Taiye was expanded south along with it. The soil excavated from the lake and the fortress's moat were piled up to the palace's north to form the Mountain of Long Life (now known as Jingshan), burying the former Yuan site and improving the fengshui of the new one. The lake now comprised the three present-day \\"seas\\", which were divided by bridges, but continued to be known collectively as Taiye. The grounds were known as the West or (, Xīyuàn) and the Jiajing Emperor and others retreated to it to escape life at court.Wan, Maggie C.K. \\"Building an Immortal Land: The Ming Jiajing Emperor's West Park\\".

After the establishment of the Manchurian Qing dynasty in the 17th century, the new government reduced the extensive Ming-era parks around the lake, enclosed the smaller present-day area within walls attached to the imperial palace, and began calling the separate sections by their modern names. Successive emperors built pavilions and houses along the lake shore, where they held court during the summer.

It was aired on November 13, 2013. The episode was written by Emily Spivey and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller. Plot The whole family, except for Haley (Sarah Hyland), heads to the school fair where everyone gets something to do. Gloria (Sofía Vergara) signed Jay (Ed O'Neill) up to be a fair cop; Manny (Rico Rodriguez) participates in the cake-baking competition; Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould) fight for the same girl; Cam (Eric Stonestreet) worries about his work as a football coach; and Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. Phil and Claire celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary and they both want to surprise each other with their gifts. Claire, who has a tradition of making the worst gifts, this time has prepared a surprise for Phil at home and she tries to make him go back home. Phil, however, does not want to leave the fair, as he arranged with the band who plays at the fair to sing a song for her. Phil manages to keep Claire at the fair till the time that he would get on stage and sing for her, but his surprise is ruined when their pharmacist, Harold Grossman (Rick Cowling), gets on stage right before Phil is supposed to get and sings amazingly. Phil feels frustrated to learn that Claire has loved Harold's singing and does not want to sing anymore, so he goes back home with Claire who surprises him with Chinese acrobats. Phil loves Claire's gift, and Claire manages for the first time to give him a gift which is actually good. Manny participates in the cake-baking competition, something that Jay does not like since the only participants are old ladies and he believes that Manny does not fit there. Gloria, to get rid of Jay, signs him up to be a fair cop. Gloria, realizing later that Jay was right about Manny not fitting to the competition, decides to destroy Manny's cake so he will not be able to participate. When Manny sees the destroyed cake, he believes that one of the other contestants did it to exclude him from the competition. Meanwhile, Cam worries about his new job as a football coach since his team has not won a game till now. When one of his students' fathers threatens that he will pull his kid from the team if they do not start winning, Cam freaks out and he tries to intimidate his students to be better players. He finally finds what his team needs to win in Manny. Jay, as a fair cop, has to be partnered with some other guy named Derrick (Jordan Peele). The problem is that Derrick is the guy who he fought with few minutes earlier about a parking space. The two of them seem to get along though and they enjoy their duties as fair cops. Luke has a crush on a girl, Sienna (Madison McLaughlin), and he asks for Alex's help on how to approach her without telling her who the girl is. Alex agrees to help him but Sienna is also the girl who Alex wants to make her best friend. When Claire tells her that Sienna is the girl Luke has crush on, Alex tries to keep him away from her. Their fight in front of Sienna just scares her away. In the meantime, Haley stayed back home to enjoy Jay and Gloria's pool thinking that no one is home, but Andy (Adam DeVine) the nanny is home, baby-sitting Joe. They run into each other and Andy tells her that she can not use the pool since Jay and Gloria are not there. Haley does not care of what Andy says, and when she is lying next to the pool, Andy tries to collect proof that she was there.

Vajracharya was born into a Newar family in Kathmandu in 1940. Vajracharya's inclination toward Sanskrit and iconography was a result of his family environment. His father and uncle were both Sanskrit scholars. It was this family tradition of studying the archaic language of the Indian subcontinent that led to Gautama attending a Sanskrit school called Samsodhana Mandala. The school itself was set up by his father, who was wary of the Western schooling model of holding exams. Career Vajracharya learned Sanskrit from Nayaraj Pant. Beside grammar Vajracharya was also taught to read ancient inscriptions and iconography. Vajracharya's first job, which was commissioned by Tribhuvan University, was writing a guide to the Basantapur Durbar Square. His career took a major turn when he was given a job in the late 1970s at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art by Dr. Pratapaditya Pal, Senior Curator of Indian and Southeast Asian Art at the museum. Vajracharya got a master's degree in Art History from the Claremont Graduate University. He completed his Ph.D. in South Asian Languages and Literature from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

The investigation started when Toronto Police Service officers made on-line contact with a man who was alleged to have been sharing pornographic videos via the Internet and by mail. The investigation eventually covered over 50 countries. Almost 350 people were arrested internationally, and 386 children were said to have been rescued.  Investigation  Following numerous complaints received by the website cybertip.ca about Azov Films, the investigation began in October 2010 when undercover police made online contact with Brian Way, a 42-year-old man from Toronto and the owner of Toronto-based Azov Films, a firm that distributed DVDs and streaming videos of naked children which it marketed as \\"naturist.\\" In May 2011 Way's home and office were raided, and he was arrested. Toronto law enforcement authorities and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service recreated Way's customer records and shared them with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Interpol. Investigations involved more than 50 countries. Way is alleged to have earned more than $4 million from his website. Apart from Canada, Australia and the United States, authorities in Hong Kong, South Africa, Spain and Sweden were involved. Investigations also spread to Greece, Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway. The Canadian arm of the operation was \\"Project Spade\\", in Australia it was \\"Operation Thunderer\\". Up to 45 terabytes of images and videos were seized. Inspector Joanna Beaven-Desjardins, of the TPS' Sex Crimes Unit, said, \\"It's a first for the magnitude of the victims saved\\" and \\"the amount of arrests internationally, also a first.\\" Beaven-Desjardins also spoke about materials seized from Way's home: \\"Officers located hundreds of thousands of images and videos detailing horrific sexual acts against very young children, some of the worst that they have ever viewed.\\" The materials distributed commercially by Azov featured nude athletic and recreational scenes, but not explicit sexual acts. The nudity-only nature of the Azov material caused it to be classified in the UK as level 1 on the COPINE scale for rating images of children, i.e., generally beneath the threshold of legal interest. This standardized rating caused controversy, as politicians and members of the UK press later accused the National Crime Agency of negligence. The investigation was officially made public in November 2013. Alternative news sources had disclosed its existence as early as December. 2012 Germany The German Federal Criminal Police Office was informed in October 2011, but investigations only started in October 2012, with the list of customers being distributed to the German states' authorities in November 2012. During 13 months of holding back any investigations it should have been obvious for Federal Criminal Police Office that within the list there were IP- numbers of Deutscher Bundestag with at least several downloads of nude material of boys of the age between 9 and 14 towards the German Bundestag IP- numbers range. Five hundred of the 800 listed persons had purchased unambiguous child pornography according to German legal standards; the rest had bought material not considered to be illegal. A German MP appeared on the list; since the material he purchased wasn't categorized as clearly illegal, the case was held back pending further investigations, until 10 February 2014, when his house was raided. According to Jörg Fröhlich, public prosecutor in Hannover, Lower Saxony, the raid took place for reason of a higher count of other public prosecutor agencies handling similar cases this way against the account of agencies favoring not to do so when found material would need to be categorized as so-called \\"II\\" instead of \\"I\\".Jörg Fröhlich, head of Staatsanwalt Hannover, Press conference 14 February 2014, www.youtube.com, PHOENIX (German). The passing of secret information regarding the investigation to the MP's party leader resulted in the resignation of the former German Interior Minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich. The home raid on Edathy when he had only purchased materials classified as legal was criticized in a national newspaper, Die Zeit, in a guest editorial by Thomas Fischer, Chief Judge of the German Federal Court. He stated, \\"Law exists in clear boundaries between permitted and forbidden behavior. Justice dares not follow he who does nothing illegal. In the Edathy case, this rule has been violated.\\" In contrast, however, Mick Moran, head of Interpol's Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation unit, issued a public warning on Twitter to \\"MAPs\\" (\\"minor- attracted persons\\") that any sign they were acting upon their sexual orientations, whether the actions were legal or illegal, \\"demonstrates an escalation of activity by 'MAPs' that must be interpreted as an increased risk to children regardless of the illegality\\" and that \\"must result in action by public safety officials.\\" Public discussion about nude pictures of children being legal in Germany, when not categorized as sexual in nature, led within hours to a published consent from all parliamentary parties, as well as from Germany's Minister of Justice Heiko Maas, for a prompt change of the relevant law. On a 19 February 2014, a non-public meeting of the federal home affairs committee where BKA president Jörg Ziercke was reporting on this affair—Ziercke admitted, according to MP Bosbach—who leads that committee—towards reporters, that he had not seen any reason to publish the involved MP's name any earlier, since at that time Sebastian Edathy was head of the NSU-murderseries committee doing inquiries against the BKA and therefore himself, Ziercke, so to prevent the obviously wrong public image of a nonexisting act of revenge.  Children  Apart from the children involved in the production of the Azov films, 386 children were said to have been rescued from exploitation by purchasers of the films. In Canada alone, 24 were rescued while six were rescued in Australia. \\"More than 330 children\\" were stated to have been rescued in the US. This high number has been questioned, since full details of the charges for 54 of the total of 76 arrests in the US had been publicly released as of 14 November 2013, and these details account for fewer than 15 persons exposed as children to current or historical sexual contact. An additional 75 to 100 children were surreptitiously indecently photographed, mostly by two arrested men who were school employees. The definition of \\"rescued child\\" used was that \\"the children were either being sexually abused or they were being sexually exploited by having videos taken of them in exploitative positions.\\" The 'exploitative positions' always included nudity or genital exposure.  Arrests  , 348 people were arrested internationally. Those arrested included priests or pastors, teachers, foster parents, doctors and nurses. A police officer and a youth baseball coach were also arrested. A Richmond, Virginia, man was sentenced to 70 months in prison on 11 April 2013, for receipt of child pornography. In Canada alone 108 people were arrested. In the US 76 were arrested.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nearly-400-children- rescued-348-adults-arrested-canadian-child-pornography-flna2D11599561 In Australia arrests began in August 2013 and 65 persons aged from 25 to 72 were arrested. In Spain 28 were arrested in December 2012.  Charges  Way has been charged with 24 offenses. The charges include \\"instruction of a criminal organisation\\" and \\"making, possessing, distributing and exporting child exploitation ... \\", which had \\"explicit images of boys ranging in age from toddlers to teens.\\" Way's mother, Sandra Waslov, is still sought by authorities.

The charges include \\" ... accessing, possessing, producing and distributing online child exploitation material\\".  Suicide of a US government official  One of the high-impact arrests resulting from Project Spade was that of Ryan Loskarn. The 35-year-old was chief of staff to U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander at the time of his arrest.“GOP senator's staffer arrested on child porn charges” , 12 December 2013 An investigation of Loskarn's electronic equipment was prompted in part by the appearance of his name on the Azov Films customer list. It uncovered graphic child pornography that had been obtained over the Gnutella peer-to-peer network ‘Statement of Facts’ re Jesse Ryan Loskarn Brian Bone, Postal Inspector, US Postal Inspection Service, 12 December 2013 Loskarn was charged with possessing and intending to distribute child pornography and released on his own recognizance five days after his arrest on 11 December 2013. On 23 January 2014, he committed suicide by hanging himself at his parents' home. In his suicide note, published on the internet by his family, he stated that \\"I found myself drawn to videos that matched my own childhood abuse.\\" The incident provoked wide discussion in Washington, with The Washington Post opinion writer Ruth Marcus suggesting that \\"we should use this sad episode to call attention to the need for mental health services—although Loskarn's problem was not lack of access but lack of willingness to accept the help available . . . But we should also use the moment to remind ourselves that reality is more complex than our cursory assumptions acknowledge, and that before we rush to condemn we might pause to consider the possibility of compassion.\\"  Suicide of Martin Goldberg  Martin Goldberg, a deputy headteacher in Essex, hanged himself after being investigated following information uncovered in Canada. Approximately 75 indecent images of children were found in his possession from his schools' changing rooms; 465 were taken at the swimming pools of his local leisure centre and 38 from other locations. The headteacher of the school that he worked at said that he felt \\"utter shock and betrayal\\" about Goldberg's behavior, which had been brought to the attention of Essex Police in 2013.

One method that has been utilized in maintaining the health of forests in Japan has been afforestation. The Japanese government and private businesses have set up multiple projects to plant native tree species in open areas scattered throughout the country. This practice has resulted in shifts in forest structure and a healthy temperate rainforest that maintains a high biodiversity. Purpose of afforestation The primary goal of afforestation projects in Japan is to develop the forest structure of the nation and to maintain the biodiversity found in the Japanese wilderness. The Japanese temperate rainforest is scattered throughout the Japanese archipelago and is home to many endemic species that are not naturally found anywhere else. As development of the country’s caused a decline in forest cover, a reduction in biodiversity was seen in those areas.Miyamoto et al. 2008 In an effort to counteract the observed decline in biodiversity, Japan began many afforestation projects. New tree stands were planted all over the archipelago and native species that inhabited the existing wild forests began to occupy the newly forested areas. Afforestation projects in Japan first started after the rebuilding that followed World War II. In efforts to restore the country’s infrastructure after the war, large areas of forest were clear-cut for timber and to create pastures to attract immigrant farmers.Shoyama 2008 A new management plan for the forests of Japan was instated after many pastures were abandoned and there was a recognized massive decline of old growth and secondary forests.Miyamoto et al. 2008 Forest plantations were created to increase the health of Japanese forests and to sustain the nation’s timber industry. Afforestation was combined with changes in logging practices that called for reduced clear-cutting and low impact logging over a larger area.Miyamoto et al. 2008 Many private businesses in the country take part in other afforestation projects as a means of reducing the carbon emissions of the company. Carbon sequestration is a major incentive for businesses to plant seedlings and saplings that will store atmospheric carbon in their biomass as they grow. Companies like Japex and Toyota have planted and maintained tree stands beside their plants located across Japan; planting several thousand native trees in an effort to offset carbon emissions. Businesses also monitor the health of newly planted tree stands by tracking growth and surveying near- by wild forests as a comparison of how well the new stands are doing. Historically, the forests of Japan were not extensively cut as a means of reducing the frequency of landslides and other natural disasters occurring. The root structure of the forests held the soil in place and stabilized the ground in an environment that experiences heavy rainfall and earthquake activity. In present afforestation projects, trees are used to anchor the soil and reduce the amount of soil erosion undergone by that area. A healthy tree stand also restricts the amount of soil disturbance due to rainfall by intercepting heavy precipitation in the canopy and by slowing the rate of run- off with the litter covering the soil. The role that the Japanese temperate rainforest plays in the prevention of soil erosion was recognized early on in the history of the nation and continues to be a positive reason to reforest open areas as new tree stands reduce the amount of nutrients lost in an area and allow for a more productive ecosystem. History The logging industry of Japan can be divided into pre-World War II and post-WWII. Prior to the Second World War, Japan has a small timber industry that impacted a small area as most of the forests were preserved to prevent erosion and maintain the overall quality of the land. It was during World War II that the logging industry really expanded as timber was increasingly in demand. The increased demand of timber during the war continued on after it had ended. Japan continued to cut down large forested areas in order to rebuild. Old growth and secondary stands were increasingly fragmented as areas were clear-cut to allow for reconstruction.Miyamoto et al. 2008 Between 1945 and 1965, there was rapid deforestation throughout the temperate rainforest of Japan. During this twenty-year period, open pastures were cultivated in the Hokkaido region of northern Japan in an effort to attract more people to the area for agricultural development. Over forty-five thousand households immigrated to the Hokkaido region, but only 28.6% stayed.Shoyama 2008 Most of the cultivated pasture land was abandoned and returned to the Japanese government from 1966-1977, as climate conditions in the area were not conducive to good crop yield. The shift from old growth forest to pasture left large areas of reduced soil fertility that trees were unable to recolonize. Due to a lack of a seed bank and competition with dwarf bamboo, human involvement was necessary to reforest the area. From 1978-2005 native trees with high growth rates were planted in plantations. It was mostly conifers that were planted in the area, but it has aided in the recovery of a conifer-broadleaf mixed forest. In 1973, there was new forestry management implemented in Japan. It restricted clear- cutting and called for selective cutting over a large area. Wild forest was left surrounding areas that had been cut and newly planted.Miyamoto et al. 2008 Though the plantation stage converted most of the old growth and secondary forests to conifer plantations, the new management pushed for reduced that shift. Present day Japan continues to organize several afforestation programs throughout the nation. The government does continue to regulate forestry, but most of the afforestation projects are now put on by various private organizations. Also, most of the timber that Japan uses is imported from foreign markets; this allows for reduced logging in Japan and more time for Japanese forests to grow. Processes involved There has been varying degrees of human involvement in afforested regions. For most of the areas that are reforested, there is a clearing of land that is planted with native saplings. Growth is generally monitored, but there is not much human involvement beyond checking the health of a stand. In other regions, there is more land preparation involved prior to planting anything. Most open areas get quickly colonized by dwarf bamboo that out-competes any saplings trying to grow in the area. To give any new saplings a chance to grow in a new area people practice soil scarification. The land is plowed and soil is rotated. This process kills off any tall grasses of bamboo in the area, effectively reducing competition for new saplings. This process does subject the soil to compaction, making it harder for roots to establish; however, once the trees are established, they can regenerate and facilitate growth of other tree species.Resco de Dios et al. 2005 To facilitate further growth and development in plantations, there is selective logging in order to create microhabitats for new growth using pit-and-mound topography. Trees are tipped over to create mounds that turn up more nutrients in the soil and allow for more sunlight in some patches of the understory. A healthy understory of young trees serves as a source of regeneration when an older, larger tree dies.Resco de Dios et al. 2005Naguchi et al. 2003. Tree species Japan afforestation projects plant only tree species native to Japan. Originally, species were chosen for their rapid growth rates and tolerance for multiple environmental conditions, which led to a large shift from old growth and secondary forests to conifer plantations. Current afforestation projects plant a more diverse number of species. The dominant tree species planted are Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa). Both conifer species are native to Japan and prefer to grow in deep, well-drained soils in warm, wet climates. Both species were able to successfully occupy the open areas made available by rapid deforestation. Other than being able to grow quickly, the trees were chosen because of their ornamental use in urban areas and because their wood is highly valuable timber.Miyamoto et al. 2008. Other native tree species are planted in an effort to regenerate mixed forests of conifers and broadleaf deciduous trees. Other species include: Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), lobed elm (Ulmus laciniata), Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla), Glehn’s spruce (Picea glehnii), and sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinensis). Changes in soil One study examining the soil of various Japanese conifer plantations found that the plantations had a higher concentration of soil organic carbon than wild, natural forests in Japan.Hirotsugu et all. 2010. Soil carbon is associated with the amount of nutrients that a soil sample can hold. When areas undergo deforestation a lot of the soil organic carbon is exposed and vulnerable to degradation. This results in a loss of nutrients in deforested areas. It would be expected that plantations would have a much smaller amount of organic carbon in the soil because the soil was exposed and experienced a nutrient loss; however, it was found that conifer plantations in Japan actually had more soil carbon than wild forests in the area. It was determined that the heavy litter from newer conifer plantations resulted in an abundance of soil carbon. It was also noted that there was less soil carbon found in plantations that had undergone soil scarification prior to being planted. This was determined to be because soil scarification brought up and exposed more soil organic carbon and more was lost to degradation; however there was still a high concentration of soil carbon in those plantations as well. Concerns Afforestation generally seen as a positive thing, and the re-establishment of forests in Japan has been positive overall. Large-scale afforestation is still a new concept, and there are some concerns associated with it. Afforested regions have impacts on local watersheds as well as species interactions. One study examined the reduced water quality of watersheds downstream of afforested conifer plantations.Ide et al. 2007. The concern was that there was no improvement seen with public water despite improved water treatment in those areas. It was found that heavy rainfall upstream in afforested conifer plantations caused an increase in nitrogen and phosphorus running off into the streams. The undeveloped understory in those plantations means that a lot of the soil is exposed. The litter does slow down the rate of the run-off, but a large amount of nutrients still get picked up and put into the watershed. This resulted in an increase in particulate and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus. A large concern in Japan is root rot experienced in conifer species as a result of Armillaria, a group of fungus species found in Asia. Sites all over Japan were examined and it was found that every conifer species native to Japan was vulnerable to at least one species of Armillaria.Hasegawa et al. 2011. This is a major concern because every conifer species is vulnerable, but it is especially concerning because the majority of the Japanese temperate rainforest is made up of conifer plantations consisting of monocultures of just a few species. Another concern is due to Japan’s practice of importing timber from other places. Although this has proven to be beneficial for Japanese forests, it has resulted in massive deforestation in places that do not have well-developed regulation on logging. Japan is one of the largest importers of timber, which has come at a cost of temperate and tropical forest decline in China and South America. As a result of this negativity, Japan has organized afforestation programs in other countries.

He was the second-born, and had ultimately four brothers and one sister. After finishing school, Swartwout intended to study at Columbia College. But as his family was highly indebted and could not afford to pay the tuition fees, he chose to join the military. He began his military career in the War of 1812 as militia colonel at New York Harbor from August to November 1812. He commanded the United States 4th Brigade in the campaign of 1813 on the St. Lawerence. Following the death of General Leonard Covington at the Battle of Chrysler's field, he was appointed Brigadier General and 9th Quartermaster General of the US Army on March 21, 1813, by President James Madison through Secretary of War John Armstrong. Later President James Monroe reappointed him Quartermaster General and he served in that capacity until June 5, 1816. War of 1812, Quartermaster General Swartwout dispatched the letter to Major General and later 9th President of the United States William Henry Harrison, June 2, 1813 announcing the American victory at the Second Battle of Sackett's Harbor on May 29, 1813. Letter from General Swartwout June 2, 1813 Real estate, \\"Swartwout\\" New Jersey Meadowlands, and Banking After the war, General Swartwout moved to New York City. He resumed his merchant career and acquired a charter on January 28, 1820 to start the New Jersey Salt Marsh Company with his brothers John and Samuel. They acquired several thousand acres between Newark and Hoboken for what was referred to as the \\"Swartwout\\" New Jersey Meadowlands and started the first large scale reclamation project to dike and drain the meadows for habitation and agriculture. Hoboken Banking and Grazing Company Bank Note New Jersey granted a charter for 15 years to Robert Swartwout and Charles Haines to establish the Hoboken Banking and Grazing Company in 1822, to issue stock for New Jersey Salt Marsh Company. They were authorized to erect one of the first banking houses and did so in Hoboken on 2nd street and Washington on Nov. 15, 1822 In 1818 General Swartwout was appointed as Naval agent for New York City, he also served in local politics as an alderman in Ward Five. Family On January 7, 1808, Robert married Margaret Bradford Dunscomb, in New York, NY. Together they had three daughters, Catherine Hone, Mary, and Margaret Dunscomb Swartwout. They also had four sons, three of whom served in the US Army, Henry died while serving in the Army in Florida in 1811, Edward and John served in the Union Army during the Civil War. Robert Swartwout Jr. (1815–1898) who was a merchant and owned The New York Rice Mill, through whom he was grandfather of Egerton Swartwout. Death His death occurred on Monday July 17, 1848, between 2 and 3pm, in the auction store of W.C. Holley at 6 Pine Street. While in conversation, Robert Swartwout said \\"I feel as if I were going to fall, hold me.\\" to the gentleman with whom had been conversing. That gentleman assisted the General to the floor, after which he breathed several times and died of apoplexy.

Motivation and Applications  Human listeners combine information from two ears to localize and separate sound sources originating in different locations in a process called binaural hearing. The powerful signal processing methods found in the neural systems and brains of humans and other animals are flexible, environmentally adaptable, and take place rapidly and seemingly without effort. Emulating the mechanisms of binaural hearing can improve recognition accuracy and signal separation in DSP algorithms, especially in noisy environments. Furthermore, by understanding and exploiting biological mechanisms of sound localization, virtual sound scenes may be rendered with more perceptually relevant methods, allowing listeners to accurately perceive the locations of auditory events. One way to obtain the perceptual-based sound localization is from the sparse approximations of the anthropometric features. Perceptual-based sound localization may be used to enhance and supplement robotic navigation and environment recognition capability. In addition, it is also used to create virtual auditory spaces which is widely implemented in hearing aids.  Problem Statement and Basic Concepts  While the relationship between human perception of sound and various attributes of the sound field is not yet well understood, DSP algorithms for sound localization are able to employ several mechanisms found in neural systems, including the interaural time difference (ITD, the difference in arrival time of a sound between two locations), the interaural intensity difference (IID, the difference in intensity of a sound between two locations), artificial pinnae, the precedence effect, and head-related transfer functions (HRTF) . When localizing 3D sound in spatial domain, one could take into account that the incoming sound signal could be reflected, defracted and scattered by the upper torso of the human which consists of shoulders, head and pinnae.Localization also depends on the direction of the sound source. HATS: Head and Torso Simulator Brüel’s & Kjær’s Head And Torso Simulator (HATS) is a mannequin prototype with built-in ear and mouth simulators that provides a realistic reproduction of the acoustic properties of an average adult human head and torso. It is designed to be used in electro-acoustics tests, for example, headsets, audio conference devices, microphones, headphones and hearing aids. Various existing approaches are based on this structural model.  Existing Approaches =Particle Based Tracking It is essential to be able to analyze the distance and intensity of various sources in a spatial domain. We can track each such sound source, by using a probabilistic temporal integration, based on data obtained through a microphone array and a particle filtering tracker. Using this approach, the Probability Density Function(PDF) representing the location of each source is represented as a set of particles to which different weights (probabilities) are assigned. The choice of particle filtering over Kalman filtering is further justified by the non- gaussian probabilities arising from false detections and multiple sources.  ITD, ILD, and IPD According to the duplex theory, ITDs have a greater contribution to the localisation of low frequency sounds (below 1 kHz), while ILDs are used in the localisation of high frequency sound. These approaches can be applied to selective reconstructions of spatialized signals, where spectrotemporal components believed to be dominated by the desired sound source are identified and isolated through the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Modern systems typically compute the STFT of the incoming signal from two or more microphones, and estimate the ITD or each spectrotemporal component by comparing the phases of the STFTs. An advantage to this approach is that it may be generalized to more than two microphones, which can improve accuracy in 3 dimensions and remove the front-back localization ambiguity that occurs with only two ears or microphones. Another advantage is that the ITD is relatively strong and easy to obtain without biomimetic instruments such as dummy heads and artificial pinnae, though these may still be used to enhance amplitude disparities. HRTF phase response is mostly linear and listeners are insensitive to the details of the interaural phase spectrum as long as the interaural time delay (ITD) of the combined low-frequency part of the waveform is maintained. Interaural level differences (ILD) represents the difference in sound pressure level reaching the two ears. They provide salient cues for localizing high-frequency sounds in space, and populations of neurons that are sensitive to ILD are found at almost every synaptic level from brain stem to cortex. These cells are predominantly excited by stimulation of one ear and predominantly inhibited by stimulation of the other ear, such that the magnitude of their response is determined in large part by the intensities at the 2 ears. This gives rise to the concept of resonant damping. Interaural level difference (ILD) is best for high frequency sounds because low frequency sounds are not attenuated much by the head. ILD (also known as Interaural Intensity Difference) arises when the sound source is not centred, the listener's head partially shadows the ear opposite to the source, diminishing the intensity of the sound in that ear (particularly at higher frequencies). The pinnae filters the sound in a way that is directionally dependent. This is particularly useful in determining if a sound comes from above, below, in front, or behind. Interaural time and level differences (ITD, ILD) play a role in azimuth perception but can’t explain vertical localization. According to the duplex theory, ITDs have a greater contribution to the localisation of low frequency sounds (below 1 kHz),while ILDs are used in the localisation of high frequency sound. The ILD arises from the fact that,a sound coming from a source located to one side of the head will have a higher intensity, or be louder, at the ear nearest the sound source. One can therefore create the illusion of a sound source emanating from one side of the head merely by adjusting the relative level of the sounds that are fed to two separated speakers or headphones. This is the basis of the commonly used pan control. Interaural Phase Difference (IPD) refers to the difference in the phase of a wave that reaches each ear, and is dependent on the frequency of the sound wave and the interaural time differences (ITD). Once the brain has analyzed IPD, ITD, and ILD, the location of the sound source can be determined with relative accuracy. Precedence Effect The precedence effect is the observation that sound localization can be dominated by the components of a complex sound that are the first to arrive. By allowing the direct field components (those that arrive directly from the sound source) to dominate while suppressing the influence of delayed reflected components from other directions, the precedence effect may improve the accuracy of perceived sound location in a reverberant environment.Processing of the precedence effect involves enhancing the leading edge of sound envelopes of the signal after dividing it into frequency bands via bandpass filtering. This approach can be done at the monaural level as well as the binaural level, and improves accuracy in reverberant environments in both cases.However, the benefits of using the precedence effect can break down in an anechoic environment.  HRTFs  The body of a human listener obstructs incoming sound waves, causing linear filtering of the sound signal due to interference from the head, ears, and body. Humans use dynamic cues to reinforce localization. These arise from active, sometimes unconscious, motions of the listener, which change the relative position of the source. It is reported that front/back confusions which are common in static listening tests disappear when listeners are allowed to slightly turn their heads to help them in localization. However, if the sound scene is presented through headphones without compensation for head motion, the scene does not change with the user’s motion, and dynamic cues are absent. Head-related transfer functions contain all the descriptors of localization cues such as ITD and IID as well as monaural cues. Every HRTF uniquely represents the transfer of sound from a specific position in 3D space to the ears of a listener. The decoding process performed by the auditory system can be imitated using an artificial setup consisting of two microphones, two artificial ears and a HRTF database. To determine the position of an audio source in 3D space, the ear input signals are convolved with the inverses of all possible HRTF pairs, where the correct inverse maximizes cross-correlation between the convolved right and left signals. In the case of multiple simultaneous sound sources, the transmission of sound from source to ears can be considered a multiple-input and multiple-output. Here, the HRTFs the source signals were filtered with en route to the microphones can be found using methods such as convolutive blind source separation, which has the advantage of efficient implementation in real-time systems. Overall, these approaches using HRTFs can be well optimized to localize multiple moving sound sources. The average human has the remarkable ability to locate a sound source with better than 5 accuracy in both azimuth and elevation, in challenging environments.

Released in 1969 by SSS International, the record was produced by Shelby Singleton and contains much of Adams' 1960s output. Background Johnny Adams was born in 1932 and grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. He absorbed the local music heritage and by his teens joined the Soul Revivers, a popular local gospel quartet. By 1959, Adams was living at a rooming house alongside songwriter Dorothy LaBostrie, who convinced him to sing several lines of a song she had just written. \\"I Won’t Cry\\", produced by a 19-year-old Mac Rebennack, became a regional best-seller. Adams continued to have a string of local hits until 1962, when \\"Losing Battle\\", a tale of backdoor romance, ascended the national R&B; charts, peaking at number 27. Adams was connected with New Orleans label Ric Records, owned by Joe Ruffino. In the fall of 1962, Adams, Smokey Johnson, Joe Jones, Earl King and Chris Kenner traveled to Detroit, where they auditioned for Berry Gordy at Motown. According to Earl King, Gordy was interested in recording Adams, but he received a telegram from Ruffino threatening legal action if he did so. Begrudgingly, Adams continued to record for Ric until Ruffino's death in 1963. Adams’ career stalled by 1964, but he persevered, cutting singles at Gone/Mercury, Huey Meaux's Pacemaker label, and Watch, a local label run by Ruffino’s brother-in-law Joe Assunto, and Henry Hildebrand. Some of Adams’ singles only sold a few hundred copies, but as he explained, \\"It kept my name out there. As long as I had a record out that got played on the radio once in a while or the jukeboxes, I could work off that. When the records stop coming, so does the work.\\" Unexpectedly, Adams caught a break in 1968 when he and Wardell Quezergue teamed up to revive \\"Release Me\\"—which had earlier been a hit for Esther Phillips and Engelbert Humperdinck. The Watch single exploded in New Orleans and attracted several national labels interested in leasing it. Eventually, Shelby Singleton's Nashville-based SSS label purchased the master, and Adams' contract. \\"Release Me\\" climbed to Number 34 on the pop charts, and his subsequent sessions were assigned to Music City. Adams’ career flourished when he was teamed with the transplanted Shreveport songwriting team of Margaret Lewis and Myrna Smith. \\"Reconsider Me\\" (Number 28) and \\"I Can’t Be All Bad\\" (Number 45)—\\"the veritable blueprints for country soul\\"—followed \\"Release Me\\" in the pop charts. SSS issued Heart & Soul, a collection of his recordings to that point, in 1969 as a reaction to the success of his singles. The cover photo pictures Adams standing on the top of a Tennessee mountain on a particularly frigid day, \\"where the temperature never got above 20 degrees!\\" Despite the success of his SSS records, Adams’ life didn’t change all that much. \\"I had a few good paydays, and I bought a new car in 1970, but things weren’t all that different,\\" claimed Adams. \\"It got to be a hassle out on the road for so long. You'd work on a promise for three nights and the promoter would disappear with the money. That happened to me in Athens, Georgia and I got stranded.

They are usually brownish with a white, yellow, or brown stripe from the eye to the base of the front legs. The head is as long as, or longer than, the prothorax. On top, the body may also be red or pink. The front wings are sharply pointed, extending 3-5mm beyond the tip of the abdomen. (insert source here) Distribution and habitat Found throughout the U.S., Mexico, Belize, Hondorus and Guatemala. Inhabits wet areas, and is usually found on emergent vegetation such as cattails and sedges. Behavior The mating season for Leptysma marginicollis begins around April, after which eggs are laid inside the stem of a plant.

Microorganisms Plastic that has made its way into marine habitats has been found to host various microorganisms. The hydrophobic nature of plastic surfaces stimulates rapid formation of biofilms, which support a wide range of metabolic activities, and drive succession of other micro- and macro-organisms. A recent study identified more than 1,000 species of bacteria and algae attached to microplastic debris, including members of the genus Vibrio, a genus which includes the bacteria that cause cholera and other gastrointestinal ailments. Some of these bacteria glow and it is hypothesized that this attracts fish that eat the organisms colonizing the plastic, which then feed from the stomachs of the fish. Plastic pollution provides a more durable \\"ship\\" than biodegradable material for carrying the organisms over long distances. This long distance transportation can move microbes to different ecosystems and potentially introduce invasive species as well as harmful algae. The microorganisms found on the plastic debris include autotrophs, heterotrophs and symbionts. The ecosystem created by the plastisphere differs from other floating materials that naturally occur (i.e., feathers and algae) due to the slow speed of biodegradation and other different conditions. In addition to microbes, insects have come to flourish in areas of the ocean that they previously could not. The sea skater, for example, has been able to reproduce on the hard surface provided by the floating plastic. Degradation by organisms Some of the organisms are thought to accelerate the biodegradation of plastic materials into potentially hazardous chemicals. This could be potentially advantageous though, as scientists may be able to utilize the microbes to break down plastic that would otherwise remain intact longer. On the other hand, as plastic is broken down into smaller pieces and eventually microplastics, there is a higher likelihood that it will be consumed by plankton and enter into the food chain. As plankton are eaten by larger organisms, the plastic may eventually accumulate in fish eaten by humans. Some of the organisms that break down plastics includeFor references, see articles: * Aspergillus tubingensis: breaks down polyurethane * Bacillus pseudofirmus: breaks down LDPE * Exiguobacterium sibiricum: breaks down polystyrene * Exiguobacterium undrae: breaks down polystyrene * Galleria mellonella caterpillars: breaks down polyethylene * Geotrichum candidum: breaks down polycarbonate * Ideonella sakaiensis: breaks down PET * Tenebrio molitor larvae: breaks down polystyrene * Arthrobacter sp. KI72: breaks down 6-aminohexanoate * Pestalotiopsis microspora: breaks down polyurethane * Salipaludibacillus agaradhaerens: breaks down LDPE One of these organisms (Ideonella sakaiensis) has been genetically modified to break down the PET even faster and also break down PEF.  Research  The plastisphere was first described by Dr. Linda Amaral-Zettler from the Marine Biological Laboratory, Dr. Tracy Mincer from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Dr. Erik Zettler from Sea Education Association. They collected plastic samples during research trips of the Sea Education Association to study \\"what kinds of microbes live in the plastisphere, how they colonize the surfaces of plastic, and how they might affect marine ecosystems\\". They analyzed plastic fragments collected in nets from multiple locations within the Atlantic Ocean. The researchers used scanning electron micrographs to determine what was colonizing the plastic surface. \\"Pit formers\\" were among the most notable finds. They speculate that these \\"pit formers\\" help to accelerate the biodegradation and form crevices where other microorganisms can colonize. Moreover, pit formers may also have the potential to break down hydrocarbons. Using a \\"combination of high-powered microscopy and state-of-the-art DNA sequencing,\\" the researchers were able to identify thousands of diverse organisms that were distinct from the \\"natural\\" environment.

History Ojo de Vaca was a watering place on the old trail between Janos, Chihuahua, Mexico to the Santa Rita copper mines. When Cooke's Mormon Battalion was searching for a wagon route between the Rio Grande and California, they intercepted the old Mexican road at this spring, then followed it southward to Guadalupe Pass then westward and northward to Tucson, pioneering the route known as Cooke's Wagon Road. In 1849, Cooke's road became the major southern route of the forty-niners during the California Gold Rush and Ojo de Vaca spring was one of the reliable watering places on what became the Southern Emigrant Trail. Later Ojo de Vaca was a water station on the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and subsequently the Butterfield company built their stagecoach station there. It remained an important stop on this route until the long distance stagecoach lines ended in the late 19th century.

The name Kaman comes from Persian, meaning \\"bow.\\" The Kaman are formally recognized by the Burmese government and classified as one of the 7 ethnic groups comprising the Rakhine national race. The Kaman are considered indigenous and are widely acknowledged as Burmese citizens who hold national identity cards. The Kaman people are religiously less conservative than the Rohingya people. Most, but not all Kaman women do not wear a hijab, as many of them work in agriculture. History In 1660, a Mughal prince, Shah Shuja, escaped to Arakan (now Rakhine State), after unsuccessfully failing to succeed the Mughal throne. The prince, along with his family and followers, relocated to Mrohaung, with the understanding that the king of Arakan would shelter him and provide ships for the prince to undergo pilgrimages to Mecca. His escape was followed by a wave of Muslim immigrants from the Mughal Empire to Arakan. The king of Arakan, Sanda Thudhamma, first warmly received the prince, but relations soon deteriorated. The prince, along with 200 followers and local Muslims, decided to overthrow the king of Arakan, who had reneged on his earlier promises. In February 1661, Shah Shuja and some members of his entourage were killed by Arakanese soldiers. In 1663, Shah Suja's children, including daughters who were taken into the Arakanese king's harem, were also killed. Shah Shuja's surviving soldiers were inducted into the Arakanese special palace guard, in a special archer's unit called Kaman (کمان, Persian \\"bow\\"). These Kaman units, alongside Afghan mercenaries from Northern India, became influential in the political machinations of the Arakan kingdom, until 1710, when King Sanda Wizaya I was able to suppress their power and exiled most of the Kaman to Ramree Island (Yanbye Island). The descendants of these Kaman units still live in Ramree and in villages near Akyab. There were 2,686 Kamans in Arakan in 1931. The Kaman have been disproportionately affected by riots in Rakhine State in 2012. In October 2013, Kamein Muslims were targeted by Rakhine Buddhists following two young Rakhine Buddhists girls aged five and six were found murdered on 17 and 18 November in separate incidents. Kameins were attacked, leaving seven deaths, and had to flee from the region.

The Freedom Ride was inspired by the Freedom Riders of the Civil Rights Movement. The Freedom Riders were all University students, and planned to go on a trip around country NSW exposing racism towards the indigenous community. They formed their own group, the Student Action for Aborigines (SAFA) The Freedom Riders had three purposes: # Draw attention to the state of Aboriginal health, education, and housing. # Point out a lessen the barriers to racially equality. # Encourage Aboriginal people to resist discrimination. The Freedom Riders picketed the Walgett RSL about its refusal to allow Aboriginal ex-servicemen to use the facilities. At Moree, they successfully desegregated the local swimming pool. At Bowraville they protested against the segregation of a cinema there. Resistance from local non-indigenous people was common. The tour bus was followed out of Walgett during the night and rammed off the road. Hall Greenland states of the Freedom Ride: \\"I like to think the Freedom Ride was a success.

The film was a minor box office success but received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Former teen salsa champion Bruce Garrett is now an engineer. Bruce gave up dancing after he was brutally bullied by older boys. When he finds out that his new boss, Julia, is passionate about salsa dancing, he decides that the only way he can win her over is by re-mastering the art of dance. He seeks out his old teacher Ron, who forces him to confront the reasons he quit dancing in the first place. He struggles with low self-esteem, as well as a bullying coworker and rival, Drew, who constantly dominates Julia's attention, a romantic interest for Bruce but sexually for Drew. With the help of his salsa classmates, teacher, and his former dancing partner, his sister Sam, Bruce gets up the courage to relearn all his 'rusty' dance steps and to recapture his lost \\"corazón\\" (heart), not only for the dance but for his life. When ready, his friends convince him to enter the local nightclub's salsa dance competition, with the idea that he'll invite Julia to be his dance partner. But when he goes round to hers to ask her out to the dance, he is tricked into believing that he's interrupting an intimate evening she's spending with Drew, so leaves before asking, disillusioned. Julia, meanwhile, discovers what Drew is up to and outright rejects his advances, then kicks him out whilst threatening his position at work. Julia follows Bruce to the nightclub, where he's been doing quite well with Sam and an old routine, and is about to enter the final heat/round of the competition. When he notices Julia had followed him to the club, he's elated and finally plucks up the courage to ask her to dance. They dance the last round of the competition, where Bruce goes on to lose the competition, but regains his true self and finally wins Julia's heart.

During the First Anglo-Dutch War he commanded the Foresight in actions at Portland (February), and the Gabbard (June), and in the Battle of Scheveningen (29–31 July), 1653. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1654–60), he won renown and a fortune in prize money when he captured a great part of the Spanish West Indian treasure fleet off Cadiz in 1656. He was knighted by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell for services in Admiral Robert Blake's destruction of Spanish ships at Santa Cruz, 1657. He was a rear-admiral of the fleet which brought Charles II to England in 1660. He was again knighted at the Restoration. He died at Lisbon, while serving as vice-admiral of the Mediterranean fleet. Biography Richard Stayner was one of several children of Roger Stayner of Tarrant Gunville, Dorset. In his youth served in the Newfoundland fisheries trade. He joined the Parliamentary navy and served in a subordinate rank during the Civil War. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 21 December 1653. On 22 June 1649 he was appointed commander of the Elizabeth prize, \\"now a State's ship\\", though a very small one, her principal armament being two sakers (that is, six-pounders). She was specially fitted out \\"for surprising small pickaroons that lurk among the sands\\" on the Essex coast, and for convoy service in the North Sea. In August he captured the Robert, a small frigate, apparently one of Prince Rupert's vessels, for which and other good services he was awarded £20 and £5 for a gold medal. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 13 April 1650. In November 1652 he commanded the Mermaid, fitting out at Chatham; but seems to have been moved from her in January to command the Foresight, which was one of the fleet with Blake in the battle off Portland on 18 February 1652. He was certainly with the fleet in the following April, when he signed the declaration of the sea-officers on the dissolution of the Rump Parliament by Oliver Cromwell, which was, in fact, a resolution \\"not to meddle with state affairs, but to keep foreigners from fooling us\\". cites cf. Gardiner, Hist. of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, ii. 218 In the battle off the Gabbard on 2–3 June 1653, Stayner commanded the Foresight in the white squadron under the immediate command of William Penn, and was afterwards sent into the river in convoy of twelve disabled ships, eleven Dutch prizes, with 1,350 prisoners, and the body of Admiral Richard Deane, which he was ordered to take to Woolwich. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 9 June 1653. Stayner rejoined the fleet in time to take part in the decisive battle of Scheveningen (29–31 July), and continued with it until the end of the season. In December he was strongly recommended by George Monck for a larger ship, and in the following January was appointed to the Plymouth, in which during the spring, until the end of the end of the First Anglo-Dutch War, he was employed in active cruising in the North Sea, during which he made several captures, including one rich East Indiaman of eight hundred tons, having on board four chests of silver. In July he was appointed by Blake to the Catherine, and in September sailed for the Mediterranean with Blake, returning to England with him in October 1655. In the following February he was in command of the Bridgwater and sailed again with Blake for Cadiz, which was kept closely blockaded. In September, when the sea-generals with the greater part of the fleet went to Aveiro, Stayner, then in the Speaker, was left off Cadiz in command of a small squadron of some six or seven ships. On 8 September he fell in with the Spanish treasure fleet which, having information from a prize that the English had left the coast, was pushing on for Cadiz in such perfect confidence that, it is said, the Spaniards supposed Stayner's ships to be fishing-vessels; yet three of Stayner's ships at least, the Speaker, Bridgwater, and Plymouth, were each of more than nine hundred tons. Nothing could be done that night, and the next morning several of Stayner's ships had fallen to leeward. He had only three with him, but these were the powerful ships just named; and as they were now within twelve miles of Cadiz, he judged that delay was unwise, and attacked the Spaniards about nine o'clock in morning. Of the four capital ships in the Spanish fleet, one escaped and ran for Cadiz, but struck on a rock and went to the bottom. The three others were captured, but two of them caught fire and were burnt with all their cargo and a great part of their men. The fourth remained in the possession of the English; some of the other ships also were taken. The value of the prize to the captors was estimated at about £600,000; but it was stated by the Spaniards that their loss was not less than nine million dollars, or nearly two millions sterling. The news of this tremendous blow reached England early in October. An official narrative of it was published on 4 October, and a thanksgiving service ordered to be held on the 8th in all the churches in London and Westminster. cites A true Narrative of the late Success … against the King of Spain's West India Fleet in its Return to Cadiz. Shortly after this Stayner returned to England with Edward Montagu (later Earl of Sandwich); but rejoined Blake early the next year, and took a brilliant part in the destruction of the Spanish ships at Santa Cruz on 20 April. Having arranged the ships with the utmost care and judgement, and those ships being supported by a considerable number of forts and batteries on shore, the Spaniards thought themselves so perfectly secure, in case of an attack, that their admiral sent Blake an open defiance. On reconnoitring the force and position of the enemy, the English admiral found it impossible to bring off the enemy's ships, though gallantry and prudence might render it possible to destroy them. Stayner was immediately detached to begin the attack, and being supported by Blake with the remainder of the fleet, the Spaniards were, in a very few hours, driven out of their ships and breast-works The former were instantly taken possession of by the English: and it being impossible to bring them off they were all set on fire and burnt to the water's edge. The Royalist politician and historian Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon eulogised this action, writing: For his conduct on this occasion he was knighted by the Lord Protector Cromwell on his return to England in the following August. During the rest of the year and during 1658 he commanded in the Downs, nominally as second to Montagu, who was most of the time in London, and really as commander-in-chief, with his flag as rear-admiral sometimes in Essex, sometimes in , and towards the end of the time in Speaker. His work was entirely administrative, and he had no active share in the battles of Mardyke and Dunkirk, though he was in constant communication with Sir William Goodsonn, by whom they were entirely conducted. In the summer of 1659 he was rear-admiral of the fleet with Montagu in the Sound, and on 16 April 1660 was appointed by Montagu to be rear-admiral of the fleet which went over to bring King Charles II to England. For this service he was knighted on 24 September (his earlier knighthood, conferred by Cromwell, not being recognised by the Royalists). In the early summer of 1661 Stayner was again commander-in-chief in the Downs, and in June sailed for Lisbon and the Mediterranean as rear- admiral of the fleet under Montagu now the Earl of Sandwich. When Sandwich took de facto possession of Tangier, it was Stayner who was put in command of the first shore battalion of seamen. Then, when Sandwich went to Lisbon to take Catherine of Braganza to London, Stayner, with his flag in the Mary, remained as vice-admiral of the fleet under Sir John Lawson. On 2 July it was reported from Lisbon that he had just arrived from Tangiers; on 20 July that he was dangerously ill; on 9 October that he had died—apparently a few days before. In pursuance of his wish to be buried beside his wife, who seems to have died in 1658, his body was embalmed and brought home in the Mary, which arrived at Spithead on 3 November. Family Richard Stayner married Elizabeth (1635?–1662), daughter of Thomas Hebbe of Loughborough. They had two children, Richard and Elizabeth. On 30 May 1663 Richard petitioned for repayment of £300 which his father had advanced for the king's service. The claim was approved by Sandwich, but there is no mention of the money having been paid.

In 1980, Fanning was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives as a Libertarian, becoming the second person elected to a U.S. state legislature under that party, following his political mentor Dick Randolph. Fanning served a single term, losing reelection. He later joined the Republican Party and was appointed to fill out a vacancy in the Alaska Senate in 1987, serving in that body for a little over a year. Early life Kenneth James Fanning was born on April 28, 1947 in Tampa, Florida. He studied at Colorado State University from 1966 to 1967, then moved to Alaska. He settled in Fairbanks in 1969, where he studied wildlife management at the University of Alaska (UA) and built a home in the Fairbanks-area suburbs southwest of the university's campus. He studied at UA through 1970. He worked as a hunting and fishing guide, a trapper, and was also employed at one point by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Fanning became involved in politics during the late 1970s, through additional work as a consultant and lobbyist on natural resource and wildlife issues. Fanning joined the Libertarian Party (LP) around this same time. The visits made to Alaska during the 1976 campaign by Libertarian presidential nominee Roger MacBride and running mate David Bergland spurred interest in the state's LP chapter. Fanning became a protege of Dick Randolph, a Fairbanks insurance agent who served as a Republican in the Alaska House from 1971 to 1974, who himself had joined the LP after meeting MacBride in 1976. State representative Fanning was elected in 1980 to a single term in the Alaska House of Representatives as a Libertarian. He followed Randolph, who won election to the House as a Libertarian in 1978 and was reelected alongside Fanning. Fanning and Randolph represented the Fairbanks North Star Borough as a whole as part of the 20th District, a six- member district without designated seats, alongside Democrats Fred Brown, Brian Rogers and Sally Smith, and Republican Bob Bettisworth. Fanning originally served as a member of the House's minority, and was given a lone committee assignment on the House's Transportation Committee.Alaska Blue Book (Fifth ed.), p.90 During his term in office, redistricting eliminated the system of multi-member, at-large districts. Running for reelection in 1982, his constituency had been drastically altered. Fanning was placed in the single-member 21st District, containing the liberal-leaning western portions of the borough. He lost reelection to the late Democratic challenger Niilo Koponen by a nearly two-to-one margin, in a contest with no Republican nominee. Party switch and state senator Fanning was one of a number of Alaska Libertarians who left the party in the wake of the schism revealed during its 1983 national convention, joining the Republican Party. In 1987, Alaska governor Steve Cowper appointed Fanning to a vacancy in the Alaska Senate. Republican incumbent Don Bennett died suddenly at home at age 56. Fanning was a compromise choice, as a feud developed between Randolph and Bev Bennett, Don Bennett's widow, over which one should be appointed to the seat, splitting Fairbanks-area Republicans. Fanning filled out the remainder of Bennett's term and was not a candidate for election to a full term. Life after politics Fanning assumed the management of a hunting and fishing lodge in Yakutat, Alaska prior to his election to the House. Following his Senate tenure, he moved to Yakutat permanently. He eventually became the owner of the business, which his family continues to run today. Most of the lodge's business has centered on fishing excursions in the Situk River. He later began spending winters in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where he was involved in the management of a bar. Personal life Ken Fanning was married to Jill Kathleen Fanning (May 24, 1948 – December 10, 2006), who was involved in the real estate business in Fairbanks and was an accomplished amateur singer. They had one child, son Kip James Fanning. They belonged to the First United Methodist Church in Fairbanks.

Manoir Industries has production sites located in Europe and Asia, and has representative offices all over the world.  History  Over the course of a century, Manoir Industries has been built by successive acquisitions, and is at the heart of the metal-processing industry. Though its history began in Pompey in eastern France, it was in 1917 that the first factory of the group was erected at a place called the Manoir, in Pîtres near Rouen, to produce cast components for the railways. Since the 1950s, thanks to new investments and new orientations, Manoir Industries has positioned itself in the petrochemical market and oil and gas market, and is acquiring an international dimension. Its metallurgical expertise, and the skills it has acquired and developed during this century of history constitute the foundations of Manoir Industries’ current and future success. Its ability to innovate, and the commitment of the men and women who work for the company are the key performance factors that have been showcased throughout Manoir Industries’ history, and are a source of trust for its customers. On 28 February 2013, the industrial group Yantai Taihai, which is the leading private nuclear player in China for cast and forged parts, acquired the Manoir Industries group.

The interior plan consists of a longitudinal mall open to the roof, lit by skylights, and entered through the central bay of each facade. and Accompanying photo History In the early 20th century, business boomed in the Arcade as downtown Norfolk's commercial area expanded until the Great Depression, at which time Monticello Arcade Company, Inc. filed for bankruptcy and the building returned to the Grandy Estate. The Arcade survived the remainder of the Depression in the hands of its new owners and went on to prosper in postwar Norfolk. Businesses in the downtown area began to suffer in the early 1960s, and during that time the Monticello Arcade began to deteriorate as revenues decreased. By the 1970s, the Arcade was in poor condition with only a few remaining tenants. Threat of condemnation loomed until 1975, when the building attained landmark status. In 1976, management of the Arcade was taken over by the newly created Monticello Arcade Limited Partnership. By the early 1980s, downtown Norfolk had been significantly restored, which resulted in recovery of Arcade business. Today the Monticello Arcade remains at the heart of Norfolk's business and retail district. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The two Rolls-Royce C8SFL diesel engines gave a total of . The transmission of the Taurus locomotives worked on a similar principle to that of the Fell diesel tested during the early 1950s. In this case, at low speeds only one engine was used, the second being engaged between 3.5 mph and 15 mph to enable haulage of 300 - 500 ton loads at speeds of up to 36 mph. The maximum speed with one engine was while the minimum speed with both engines was . Both engines drove to a common torque converter and used a common throttle control with a separate lever being provided to engage the second engine as the need arose. It would appear that the name came from Taurus the bull while maintaining the ‘….us’ theme of Yorkshire Engine Company locomotive types (Janus, Olympus, Taurus, Indus). The first Taurus (works number 2875) was demonstrated and tested on British Railways during 1961 and 1962 and a builders sectioned elevation drawing of the machine appeared in the July 1961 issue of Trains Illustrated Magazine. Taurus was a ‘trip’ locomotive intended to carry out shunting work and hauling local (short distance) goods trains. This was the duty for which the British Rail Class 14 locomotives were built in 1964–65. When the latter started to become available on the secondhand market in 1968, the market for new heavy duty industrial locomotives was severely affected. Following the trials, the Taurus was returned to the manufacturer's works in Sheffield and was dismantled, leaving only the chassis (which was scrapped in 1965). Two Indus locomotives were built in August 1962 – one for Richard Thomas and Baldwins’ Llanwern steelworks, the other for Stewarts & Lloyds. The main difference between the Indus and Taurus was in the type of hydraulic transmission – the Taurus used a differential compounding gearbox, while the Indus used a simple compounding gearbox. These two locomotives differed in detail; the Stewarts Lloyd locomotive (works number 2894) was still extant at the British Steel Corby site, albeit out of use, until at least 1983. A second Taurus locomotive was built for RENFE, the national Spanish railway network, to a gauge of . It is possible (but not proven) that all the components from the British Rail demonstrator were transferred from the standard gauge chassis onto the wider chassis for Spain. (A works number is usually allocated to the chassis/frame, so it is appropriate that the demonstrator No. 2875 has a different works number from the Spanish locomotive No. 2892, even if many parts were reused.) A hoped for follow-on order from RENFE did not materialise. They had experienced problems with the gearbox, so YEC changed it for the type used in the Indus, effectively making it an Indus, which changed the top speed and tractive effort, and reduced its usefulness. The Spanish Taurus locomotive survives in the Museo del Ferrocarril in Madrid.

The cemetery is located in the district of Targówek (near the better known district of Praga, and within Praga's unofficial neighborhood). The cemetery has been founded in 1780. It occupies an area of . Approximately 300,000 people are presumed to have been buried there, though only about 3,000 graves (tombstones) are preserved to this day. It is the largest Jewish cemetery in Warsaw. It is also said to be one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in Europe. History The cemetery was opened in 1780 by Szmul Zbytkower, a Polish Jewish merchant and financier, who donated the land for that purpose (though he benefited from selling burial rights and other \\"arbitrary exactions\\" afterward). By mid-19th century the cemetery has grown to 18 ha. Since the 1870s the cemetery was administered by the local Jewish council, which refocused it on the burials of impoverished Jewry; this marked the beginning of the deterioration of the facilities. The cemetery suffered from a lot of destruction during the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany in World War II, both due to the German administration's purposeful use of the cemetery as a source of building material and due to collateral damage from the war. After the war it was the site of the mass burial of Jewish fatalities exhumed during the rebuilding of Warsaw; it was officially closed in 1950. It has suffered from continued deterioration since, receiving negligible support from the local administration. The cemetery was administered by the Nissenbaum Foundation from 1984 to 2010. The cemetery is occasionally vandalized, and criminal incidents (robberies) have been known to happen there. This has caused activists and members of community to demand that the cemetery, designed as a monument in 2009, should be better protected. City council representatives in 2010 noted that their first priority is protecting the cemetery from vandalism, and restoration is secondary to that. As of 2010, the Nissenbaum Foundation has stopped its involvement with the cemetery, and its legal status had to be determined by the court, with both the Warsaw City Council and the Jewish Community of Warsaw showing interest in administering the land. In 2012 the cemetery was passed to the Jewish Community of Warsaw which wants to start a new renovation program in the near future.

Martinez around 1890 Luis Alfredo Martínez Holguín (June 23, 1869 in Ambato – November 26, 1909) was an Ecuadorian writer, painter, politician, and agriculturist. He introduced Realism into Ecuadorian literature. He was an opponent of the government of Eloy Alfaro. He worked in different regions and at various jobs, from the humblest to the most prestigious, and knew about the life of the people, which allowed him to write his masterpiece, A la Costa (1904), one of Ecuador's first realist novels, describing faithfully the social changes taking place in his country in the late nineteenth century. In addition to a literary career, he fought against the liberal guerrillas in the 1890s, managed the Valdez sugar mill and was sub-secretary and Minister of Education. He also promoted construction of a railway between Ambato and the Ecuadorian Amazon which could not be completed. He wrote a treatise on agriculture and one in defense of the indigenous people of Ecuador. Martínez was also a painter. During his lifetime he had a critically acclaimed exhibition of his paintings in Buenos Aires and one of his paintings was awarded Honorable Mention in a contest in Chicago. Some of his best paintings are now housed outside Ecuador. Two are in the United States Library of Congress, two in the Modern Art section of the Vatican Museum, and one is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

His Novels Hemanthagaana, Uttarayana and Bandaya are the major contributions to the Kannada Novel. Career Ballal was extremely sensitive in his portrayal of women in his works such as Anurakte, Vatsalya Patha, Hemanthagana, and Uttarayana. A critical analysis on Ballal’s novels titled Ballalara Kadambarigalu was brought out by MGM College under the stewardship of its then principal and writer Ku. Shi. Haridasa Bhat. \\"Yet some questions still remain a mystery. Why did Ballal not choose to lead his retired life in Udupi, where he was born? Why was Ballal not chosen as president of the 74th All India Kannada Sahitya Sammelan held in Udupi? These questions will torment us for a long time,\\" Prof. Hiriyadka said. Vyasaraya Ballal had started his literary life by his contributions to a Kannada journal Nudi started in Mumbai. In fact his first novel Anurakte had appeared as a serial in Nudi. It was later published as a novel. Vyasaraya Ballal and other friends in Mumbai, who were filled with ideas of securing freedom for the country and socialism,Importance of Kannada Ballal writings also focussed on the importance of Kannada medium and Kannada learning. Ballal’s candidature for the post of the president of 74th All India Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in Udupi was not pursued vigorously. Ballal was a man of few words. He was a sensitive person and this sensitivity was reflected in his works. Ballal brought forth beautifully the working of trade unions in his novel Bandaya. Vyasaraya Ballala was known for his revolutionary thinking and had written more than 25 books including novels, 100 short stories, politics, two plays and children's books. His novel 'Uttarayana' is acclaimed as his best work, while two other books 'Bandaya' and 'Manjari' received wide critical acclaim. 'Bandaya' brought him Kendra Sahitya Akademi award. The writer, who lived in Mumbai for five decades, had contributed short stories for Akashvani-Mumbai. He also served as the editor of 'Nudi', a Kannada weekly published by Kamaladevi Chattopadhay. He was a prominent member of Karnataka Sangha in Mumbai and also contributed to the columns in the dailies. After his retirement, Mr Ballala settled in Bangalore where he continued to write. Mr Ballala was a disappointed man lately as his name was not considered by the Central Office of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) for the presidency of 74th 'Akhila Bharatha Kannada Sahitya Sammelan' held in Udupi last month. He was born in Ambalapady near Udupi in 1923. His childhood was tough and after his matriculation he went to Mumbai and worked as a steno in a private company.

It produces reports and analyses of current political issues and aims to contribute to public debate by formulating progressive policy solutions. Through its work it also seeks to contribute to the renewal of social democracy and social democratic ideas in France and across Europe. History Terra Nova was set up in 2008 by Olivier Ferrand (future Socialist Party deputy and former adviser to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin) in order to contribute to the intellectual renewal of left-wing politics. Since then, Terra Nova has gained significant influence in political and media circles, producing over 30 major reports between 2008 and 2012, which have been frequently reported in newspapers such as Le Monde and Libération. In 2009, it was a Terra Nova report of 2008 that was instrumental in persuading the Socialist Party to adopt a system of open primaries (see French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011) for the 2012 French presidential election. In the same year, another Terra Nova report proved controversial in arguing that the Left should rely less on a traditional working class electorate and more on a broad coalition of women, young people, and ethnic minorities, all united by 'Progressive Values'. Work Terra Nova's work broadly consists of two different kinds of publication: long, detailed analyses of public policy issues known as 'reports', and shorter 'policy briefs' or 'notes' on current affairs, which are published on Terra Nova's website several times a week. For the production on its analyses, Terra Nova relies on a broad network of external experts, largely academics, researchers, civil servants, and people with experience in relevant fields. These experts are organized into working groups based around a particular policy area, or 'theme', such as 'Education', 'Financial regulation' or 'Environment'. Terra Nova also seeks to stimulate public debate and engagement with policy issues by organizing major public events, such as debates and round-tables with experts, leading politicians, and other public figures. Lastly, Terra Nova engages with young people through its student wing, Terra Nova Etudiants, which similarly produces reports and policy briefings and organizes events. Management Since the death of founder Olivier Ferrand in 2012, the President of Terra Nova was François Chérèque, former secretary- general of one of France's largest trade unions, the CFDT. Together with a bureau, and an administrative council made up of a range of political, academic and business personalities, he oversees the work and political direction of Terra Nova, while day-to-day management is carried out by a Director-General. In June 2017, Chérèque was succeeded by Lionel Zinsou. Political positions Although officially independent and with no organizational links to any party, Terra Nova traditionally been seen and close to the Socialist Party. For example, founder Olivier Ferrand was elected to the National Assembly for the Socialist Party in 2012. However, Terra Nova has been unafraid to criticize official Socialist policy at times, and with a Socialist Party government since 2012 its role as an independent think tank has left it in a strong position to formulate independent policy analyses that do not necessarily take the government line. As a left-wing think tank, Terra Nova was deeply critical of the policies of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, arguing that his fiscal policies benefited large businesses and the well-off at the expense of ordinary families, and considering his hard-line policies on immigration and security 'anti-republican'. However, Terra Nova's positions have also elicited controversy within the Left, particularly its support for pension reform, and its desire to re-orient left-wing electoral strategy around an electorate based more on progressive values than class. In 2009, it was a Terra Nova report of 2008 that was instrumental in persuading the Socialist Party to adopt a system of open primaries to choose its candidate for the 2012 Presidential Elections. Since the election of the Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande to the French Presidency in the 2012 elections, Terra Nova has been seen as a critical friend of the government. Recently, Terra Nova's report on banking reform, which contained a proposal to separate the commercial and investment wings of major banks, was seen as a critique of the socialist government's more cautious policy. Most recently, Terra Nova has called for major investment in pre-school and early childhood and one of the best ways to promote social mobility and more equal life chances. French Think Tank of the Year (2011 and 2012) In both 2011 and 2012, the Assembly of French Chambers of Commerce and Industry, together with the Observatory of French Think Tanks, awarded Terra Nova the prize for French Think Tank of the Year.

He regarded the Gandhi-Ambedkar debate on the issue of caste system and untouchability as the most important contemporary debate whose outcome would determine the fate of India in the 21st century. He was one of the founders of the Bandaya movement along with Shudra Srinivas and Siddalingaiah, and gave the movement its famous slogan, \\"Khadgavagali kavya! Janara novige midiva pranamitra!\\" (\\"Let poetry be a sword! The dear friend who responds to the pain of people!\\")  Early life  Doddaballapura Ramaiah Nagaraj was born on 20 February 1954 to Ramaiah and Akkayyamma in Doddaballapur in the erstwhile Mysore State of India (present-day Karnataka). His family belonged to the weaver caste and his father was a teacher. Nagaraj was schooled in his home town, after which he studied at the Government Arts and Science College, Bangalore. He was known as an excellent debater in college and it was during these intercollegiate debates that he got interested in Dalit and Bahujan politics. Nagaraj went to study further and obtained a master's degree and then a PhD from Bangalore University. In 1975, he joined Bangalore University as a research scholar in the Kannada Department (formally known as the Kannada Adhyayana Kendra), and subsequently became part of the Kannada faculty. Career Nagaraj rose through the ranks at the Bangalore University quickly, becoming a Reader and then, just before his death in 1998, he was named for the newly established Kailasam Chair. In addition to his primary affiliation with the Kannada Department of Bangalore University, Nagaraj was a fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla (1993–4); Senior Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS, Delhi (1994–6); and Visiting Professor in the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago (1997 and 1998). Nagaraj wrote six books among several essays in Kannada. He has also edited 15 Kannada books, including an anthology of Urdu literature. Flaming Feet is his collection of essays on the Indian Dalit movement whose title article \\"Flaming Feet\\" discusses the varied philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and B. R. Ambedkar on Dalit emancipation and tries to find an underlying unity. A revised and extended version of this book was posthumously published as The Flaming Feet and Other Essays: The Dalit Movement in India in 2011. Listening to the Loom: Essays on Literature, Politics and Violence is his other collection of essays. These books have been translated into Tamil and Telugu languages. He also published many essays in English. Many of his Kannada essays have been translated into English and other languages since his death. At the time of his death in 1998, Nagaraj was serving as the Director of Shabdana — Centre for Translation, a project of the Sahitya Akademi, and editor of Akshara Chintana, a series of critical works published by Akshara Prakashana of Heggodu. In the months preceding his death, he was \\"probing the nature of feminism as a frame for a new dalit literary criticism.\\" Personal life Nagaraj met his wife Girija, while he was teaching at Bangalore University. Girija was a student of literature as well as science. They have two children, Amulya and Anoop. Nagaraj died of a heart attack in 1998.  Select bibliography  Dr. Nagaraj published his first book, Amruta mattu Garuda (Nectar and the Eagle) in 1983 and the second book, his PhD thesis on modern Kannada poetry and poetics, Shakti Sharadeya Mela (The Festival of Shakti and Sharade) shortly thereafter.

Cherrabun was formed when Gogo Station was carved up into three separate properties; Cherrabun, Margaret Downs (known as Gogo) and Christmas Creek. This followed a revision of the Land Act in 1911 restricting holdings to a size of one million acres. Gogo was owned by the Emanuel brothers who also owned Meda Station. The area was struck by drought between 1951 and 1953 with the number of cattle being reduced by half. This was the first drought suffered by pastoralists in 70 years with many hurriedly sinking bores and buying feed to keep their stock alive.

Among these public buildings are two baths, two churches, a defense structure, rock tombs, a theater, an arched and domed structure, a monumental cultic niche, walls, a villa, other monumental buildings and some religious buildings. The church floors are decorated with mosaics and have images of the rivers of Gihon, Pishon, Tigris and Euphrates imprinted on them, which are mentioned in the Bible. Various animals are also depicted in the mosaics of the ancient city, which has been likened to the ancient city of Zeugma.Archaeologists to solve mystery in ancient city of Hadrianapolis One of the earliest known churches in Anatolia was excavated in Hadrianopolis. In December 2019, archaeologists unearthed an 1800-year-old limestone slab containing a female silhouette most likely depicts Demeter. According to the archaeologist Ersin Çelikbaş, there was an inscription on the surface of the slab- \\"Herakleides, the son of Glaukos\\". \\"The slab has a figure of a woman on it wearing a traditional dress, holding ears of wheat in her right hand and wearing a belt with a snake on her waist.

As a predatory insect, it feeds on other smaller arthropods such as springtails. It is now restricted to parts of northern Europe such as Sweden, Finland and Russia, having gone extinct in areas like Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland sometime before 1996. It lives in damp areas of open fine sand beaches where they have been observed hunting by running their prey down. Biology Belonging to the rove beetle family, Staphylinidae, these beetles have a segmented abdomen, with shortened wing cases and are typically very small. Due to their similarity, the Staphylinidae beetles are quite difficult to identify, however their silvery hairs on their elytra are a unique identifier for this species. The Steninae have two glands near the base of the tail which release a surfactant that can propel them across water. Ecology S. palposus was observed on the damp, fine sanded shores of Lough Neagh showing rapid stop-start movement. It is very agile - probably a useful adaptation for living in open, sandy habitats. Their possible major food source is collembola such as Anurida maritima which is common on the beaches of Lough Neagh although it was observed to stalk an ephydrid (Diptera) from behind. Overall, very little information on S. palposus currently exists making this an important target species for further research. Threats and conservation S. palposus has been threatened by pollution, erosion and disturbance of their natural habitat. Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, is a fine sanded beach habitat which is threatened by these factors, and also contains a wide range of beetle fauna [1]. A 2006 survey found no extant populations of S. palposus in Northern Ireland. Due to the extinction threat posed on this species, it was placed on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species list in 2007 as well as the Northern Ireland Biodiversity list as a priority species in 2010. Distribution Range of countries where still found: *Sweden *Finland *Germany *Norway *Netherlands *Russia *Austria *Switzerland *Liechtenstein *Denmark Last documented in the UK 1983.

His work was admired by Frank O'Hara, James Schuyler, Harry Mathews, and others, and translated extensively by John Ashbery, with whom he shared his life in Paris for nearly a decade. His work has appeared in many books in both England and the United States, as well as in The New Yorker and Poetry. Martory’s personal “charm,” the poet Ann Lauterbach once said, “devolved back to the original meaning of ‘spell.’” However, as Ashbery has noted, “Both the humor and the sadness in his poems are always rendered with an unemphatic clarity that is certainly Mozartian.” Born in Bayonne, France, of partly Basque ancestry, Pierre Martory spent much of his early life in Morocco. He joined the Free French Forces in North Africa when World War II interrupted his college studies at the School of Political Science, Paris. Afterwards, he began writing fiction and poetry and studied music as well. In 1953, Denoël published his first novel, Phébus ou le beau mariage. His other novels remain unpublished. For more than twenty years, he was drama and music critic at Paris Match, where he mentored and worked with the journalist Denis Demonpion, now editor of Le Point and a biographer. John Ashbery, in France on a Fulbright scholarship, met Martory in March 1956, and they lived together there for nine years, inspiring and influencing each other’s work. Ashbery dedicated The Tennis Court Oath (1962), one of his most experimental collections, to Martory. As Ashbery suggests, Martory composed poetry with “trace elements of Holderlin, Rilke and Trakl,” with “echoes of ‘fringe’ surrealists like Pierre Reverdy and the chameleon-like Raymond Queneau,” and with “the austerity of Jouve’s poetry and the cloudy fantasy of Supervielle’s. . . . There is a touch of the gaiety of Charles Trenet and of René Clair’s early films; of the blues of his favorite singers Florel and Piaf.” But as Ashbery concludes, “In the end, the only fruitful comparison seems to be with Arthur Rimbaud, and not because Martory’s poetry resembles his, but because both are similar in resembling no one else.” Martory collaborated with Francis Wishart on a volume of text and etchings entitled Père Lachaise in the seventies, and Wishart also created art for a posthumous collaboration, Oh, Lac / Oh, Lake, in 2008. In 1990, Ashbery translated Martory’s first poetry collection, Every Question but One (Intuflo Editions–Groundwater Press, 1990). Of his second collection, The Landscape is Behind the Door (Sheep Meadow Press, 1994), Ashbery says, “His dreams, his pessimistic résumés of childhood that are suddenly lanced by a joke, his surreal loves, his strangely lit landscapes with their inquisitive birds and disquieting flora, are fertile influences for me.” Veilleur de jours (Alyscamps Press/Sheep Meadow Press, 1997), his first French collection, contains a broad selection of work. An extensive selection of his poetry and an essay on Henry James's Washington Square appear in Ashbery's two Collected French Translations volumes. Schuyler's poem \\"Letter to a Friend: Who Is Nancy Daum\\" refers to an Alex Katz portrait of Martory with a pipe, in the collection of the Flow Chart Foundation. An interview in The American Poetry Review with the poet from 1992 is available online. In the Times Literary Supplement, the poet Mark Ford predicts a wider recognition to come for this transatlantic poet: \\"It is to be hoped that, just as Edgar Allan Poe only became acceptable to Americans once endorsed by Baudelaire, the French will soon find themselves belatedly discovering one of their finest twentieth-century poets, and saluting him in the niche in the poetic pantheon prepared by his American admirers.\\"  References  * Selected Prose - John Ashbery . pp. 238–271. * Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets - Terence Diggory. p. 33\\\\. * Becoming a Londoner: A Diary - David Plante. p. 102\\\\.

Les Colombières (The Dovecote) is a villa in Menton, in the Alpes-Maritimes department on the French Riviera. The gardens of the villa were designed by Ferdinand Bac between 1918 and 1927. Bac also designed modernist furniture for the house and personally painted all the villa's frescos and paintings. The gardens are in size, and have been described as full of \\"wit, brilliance and imagination\\" that \\"inspire both the intellect and the imagination\\". Bac's friends Émile and Caroline Ladan-Bockairy bought the Domaine des Colombières in 1918; before this, it was the property of the philosopher Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée. The Ladan-Bockairys invited Bac to come to live with them and to rebuild and enlarge the building. His design for the house drew on his memories from visits to different Mediterranean countries. Bac painted the frescoes in the house and designed the Modernist furniture. The villa, built in 1790, is set over three storeys, and is in size. It has 14 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms, with an exterior painted red and yellow. The interior of the house is adorned with frescos painted by Bac, featuring idealised landscapes from Mediterranean countries including Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Morocco. Some of the rooms are themed; a carnival scene is depicted in the Venetian Room, a room also decorated with a Murano glass chandelier and gondola lights. Wooden cabinets painted with birds line the Parrot Room. During the Second World War, the villa was used in the rehabilitation of Italian soldiers and, subsequently, as a bed-and-breakfast. Prominent visitors to Les Colombières included the artist Jean Cocteau and the French war hero Marshal Joseph Joffre. Bac died in Compiègne in November 1952, aged 93; he survived Émile Ladan-Bockairy by three days. Caroline Ladan-Bockairy lived for several years afterward, and the three of them are buried in a mausoleum on a rock overlooking the garden at Les Colombières. Garden Bac planned a garden around the house with pavilions, colonnades, bridges, and secret gardens. There were quiet, enclosed spaces and open areas of wild plants with broad vistas. Bac wrote that \\"the soul of gardens shelters the greatest sum of serenity at man's disposal.\\" Bac wrote two books about his Mediterranean gardens, Les Colombières and Jardins enchantés. Created on the site of an olive grove, the gardens are set over several levels, studded with Mediterranean cypresses. The gardens reference classical literature such as Homer's Odyssey, including Nausicaa's fountain, a garden named for Ulysses, and a head of Medusa. At the centre of an avenue of large olive jars is a 600-year carob tree, said to be the oldest carob tree in France. Twelve small buildings guide visitors through the garden. The site is located on a hillside above Menton's harbour. and noted for its fine views of the Bay of Menton and Menton's old city. Recent history Les Colombières was classified as a French Monuments Historique in October 1991. The estate has been owned by a British couple, Michael and Margaret Likierman, since 1995. Michael Likierman was the founding CEO of the French arm of Habitat furniture stores. Margaret Likierman had first visited the house on a guided tour of its garden three years earlier, as a participant of a colloquium on the future of historic private gardens. Half of the estate had been sold by Caroline's Ladan-Bockairy's descendants, and the Ladan-Bockairy's last child died in 1991. In their purchase of the estate the Likiermans had to negotiate with the grandchildren of the Ladan-Bockairys, and restore the house with sensitivity, in order to comply with their acquisition of a \\"Monuments Historiques\\". The restoration of Les Colombières was enabled by the assistance of Jean-Yvan Yarmola, the chief architect of France's \\"Monuments Historiques\\", the Czech contemporary sculptor Ivan Theimer, architect Bernard Camous, and landscape designer Arnaud Maurières. The Likiermans spent five years restoring the house at a cost of €4 million, and moved into Les Colombières in 2000. Their restoration was designed with a potential future purchaser in mind, as a swimming pool and air conditioning were added to the house, and \\"the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms.\\" References   External links *Official site Category:French Riviera Category:Gardens in Menton Category:Houses in Alpes-Maritimes Category:Modernist architecture in France Category:Monuments historiques of Alpes-Maritimes Category:Villas in France ","title":"Les Colombières"},{"id":"41089647","text":"Leslie Gordon Kittle (26 February 1894 – 28 March 1965) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton and Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

The story revolves around a group of teenagers in an orphanage set during the civil war in Sri Lanka. The film premiered at the 2013 Busan International Film Festival and had a theatrical release in India on 28 March 2014. Although it was positively received by critics, the film was withdrawn by Santosh Sivan from theatres, but met with protests three days later owing to protests from fringe Tamil groups in Tamil Nadu. It was election time and the film was a \\"U\\" censored, and had a Govt Tax free tag . Cast * S. Karan as Nandan * Sugandha Ram as Rajini * Saritha as Tsunami Akka * Karunas as Stanley * Shyam Sundar (Matsyavadhaaram director) as Ravi * Janaki as Stella * Soumya Sadanand * Vikram Chakravarti * M. K. Vijayan * Malini Sathappan Production In 2009, it was first reported that Santhosh Sivan's next film would be \\"a hard-hitting political film scripted around the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam)-related strife and the death of its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran\\". In June 2012 then he stated \\"in Ceylon I want to look at the Sri Lankan situation from the perspective of a bunch of youngsters who get caught in the crisis. It's more about the outsiders' response to the horrors than about the politics\\". He also told that he will shoot in Sri Lanka after the rains and that he didn't want \\"Ceylon to look like a tourist's attraction\\". Sivan described Ceylon as his pet-project. Santosh Sivan later said that the film was about \\"a bunch of teenagers in an orphanage, and set against the backdrop of a civil strife\\". One of the teenagers, the protagonist was a 16-year-old boy, Karan, with Down's Syndrome with whom Sivan spent nine months before shooting the film. Sugandha Ram, who acted in Tere Bin Laden before, was chosen to portray the female lead. Sugandha later told that the film was offered in 2010 to her but did not happen then and that the script was later altered and she got an opportunity to audition for the role again. It was reported that Saritha played the role of a person who runs the orphanage. According to Sivan, the idea for the film was conceived over a Sri Lankan lunch with a friend during which they met a lady who ran an orphanage in Sri Lanka. Sivan wanted director Stanley for a role, but cast Karunas for it since he could also sing. Karunas was said to have done a serious role unlike his usual comic self. Sivan stated, \\"my film is about human aspirations and emotions shattered by the war, not about the politics behind it\\". He also clarified the film will have nothing to do with the LTTE. Sivan spent months researching and getting footage for the film. He shot it in Tamil as Inam but also made the film into English for a larger audience and titled it Ceylon. The Tamil version was longer and included songs, scenes for comic relief and the making of the film over end credits and the English version, Sivan said, \\"is much tighter\\". The film was shot by Sivan himself in various locations including Kerala, Thirunelveli, Rameswaram and Maharashtra with a Red Epic digital camera. Since he could not go for many takes, three or four cameras were used at the same time. Though he used a high-end digital camera he said that he purposely made the shots look candid as if they had been captured through a mobile phone or a hand-held camera as he found out that mobile phones played an important role in the Sri Lankan wars. Editor Suresh was also asked \\"to keep all good-looking shots aside\\" as Sivan felt that the film \\"should be raw and rustic\\" and not beautiful. The first look resembling a blood splattered fingerprint forming the map of Sri Lanka, which was designed by Jairam Posterwala, was revealed in June 2013. Arvind Swamy provided a voice-over for the film. The film was cleared by the Censor Board with a clean U certificate in October 2013. Actor Udhaya's wife Keerthika Udhaya had dubbed for Sugandha in all versions. Music Vishal Chandrasekhar was signed as the music director. Sivan stated that \\"the background score is heart thumping\\" since it was a thriller film, but that a Baila, and \\"a few romantic numbers, treaded in a different way\\" were also included. Release The film was first screened at the 18th Busan International Film Festival. The film's Tamil Nadu distribution rights were bought by N. Lingusamy's Thirrupathi Brothers in February 2014. Prior to the theatrical release, Sivan and Thirrupathi Brothers held premiere shows in Chennai and Mumbai. The film was released in Tamil Nadu theatres on 28 March 2014. Following protests from Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TDMK) activists, who had attacked the Balaji Theatre in Puducherry, stating the film projects the Sri Lankan Civil War in bad light, four scenes and one dialogue were removed the following day. After Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam politician Vaiko too severely criticized the film for being pro-Sinhalese, Lingusamy decided to stop screening and withdraw the film from theatres from 31 March 2014 onwards. Critical reception After its theatrical release, it received positive reviews from critics. Sify wrote, \\"Inam is a charming film that pulls at your heart strings. Santosh has made a film on a very sensitive subject, but has handled it beautifully without any propaganda, preaching or twisting of facts\\" and called it \\"very good\\". Behindwoods gave it 3.25 stars out of 5 and called it \\"a disturbing tale, brilliantly captured\\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"Sivan is happiest when concocting near-surreal imagery that hints at mood rather than tells a story. The big scenes, on the other hand, don’t work as well. The slice-and-dice vignettes approach results in broad characters rather than complex people capable of holding together a sustained narrative. The effort to humanise them (at least cinematically) through songs doesn’t work\\". The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Inam is very much topical and mostly presents a neutral perspective on the last phase of the brutal civil war. It wants to show how war can tear apart the moral fibre of humans, and how it affects even those who aren't involved in the fighting...Yet, somehow, Inam stops short of being a hard-hitting film. It is very reluctant to spell things out, which...makes everything a little hazy, as the context isn't firmly established...there are times when we can see Sivan leaning a little too much on his visuals to create the desired impact\\". Hindustan Times wrote, \\"Although the plot is wafer thin, Sivan’s script includes an array of anecdotes to keep the movie moving. If there is a flip side to Inam, it lies in its utter melancholy. Despite, Sivan’s efforts to inject a bit of joy through songs and wit, the film refuses to rise above excruciating sorrow\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Inam is a pretentious piece of work, one is not exactly sure what the director wishes to convey. The film is neither entertaining nor thought provoking. There is a total lack of clarity of purpose, focus and sensitivity\\". IANS gave it 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Inam comes straight from the heart of Santosh Sivan. It deserves to be accepted, embraced and celebrated\\". The Hollywood Reporter in its review wrote, \\"Romancing in slow-motion; musical numbers ill-fitting the narrative flow; high-octane shootouts laced with the odd comic touch; a highly-strung, tragic final half hour intended to stir emotions -- Santosh Sivan’s latest offering boasts of all the hallmarks of commercial Indian cinema, which should allow the Kerala-born director to continue the fine run he has had in the past few years...but more focus and context would have helped the film live up to its seemingly more historical-epic title of Ceylon\\". Gulf News wrote, \\"Director Santosh Sivan has crafted his characters with great care and their unique traits set each one apart. Matched with a laudable performance by the cast, Inam keeps the audience engaged. With Sivan’s signature on every frame, Inam is sheer poetry\\".
