It is a unique tissue in that it is a multi-nucleated, terminally differentiated syncytium, extending to 13cm. Function It is the outer layer of the trophoblasts and actively invades the uterine wall, rupturing maternal capillaries and thus establishing an interface between maternal blood and embryonic extracellular fluid, facilitating passive exchange of material between the mother and the embryo. The syncytial property is important since the mother's immune system includes white blood cells that are able to migrate into tissues by \\"squeezing\\" in between cells. If they were to reach the fetal side of the placenta many foreign proteins would be recognised, triggering an immune reaction. However the syncytium acts as a giant cell so there are no gaps for immune cells to migrate through. One way in which it accomplishes this task is by suppressing the expression of immunity-related genes HLA-A and HLA-B, which are classically known to be expressed by all nucleated cells. These genes normally express the MHC-I ligand that acts as a major binding mechanism for T-cells. By decreasing the translation of these gene products, the syncytiotrophoblast reduces the chances of an attack by the maternal immune system mediated by T-cells. The syncytiotrophoblast secretes progesterone and leptin in addition to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (HPL); hCG prevents degeneration of the corpus luteum. Progesterone serves to maintain the integrity of the uterine lining and, until the syncytiotrophoblast is mature enough to secrete enough progesterone to support pregnancy (in the fourth month of embryonic development), it is aided by the corpus luteum graviditatis.Langman's Medical Embryology, 10th Edition.

History=Early years In 1923, the United Farmers of Alberta met with then Attorney General John Edward Brownlee to consider setting up a Wheat Pool just in Alberta. On the advice of Aaron Sapiro, a California lawyer they created a non share, non-profit organization responsible solely for selling wheat for the best advantage. It was set up as a one-man, one-vote organization, with a 5-year contract required to deliver 100% of his commercial wheat to the Pool. United Grain Growers grain company and the Alberta Pacific ElevatorAlberta Pacific Grain company agreed to accept Pool deliveries in their facilities. Other elevator owners quickly agreed to accept Pool wheat when they realized the pricing power the farmers had created. The Pool purchased the grain produced by its members at a provisional or initial price. The pool then sold the grain, and if there was a surplus in the account at the end of the year, it was distributed to its members at a pro-rated basis. Everyone who was a member of the Pool received the same price. Initially 26,000 farmers joined the Pool, with hundreds of shipping points. The Alberta Wheat Pool started making direct sales to flour milling companies and even exported grain directly. Direct sales accounted for over 60% of the total in the first year. They had to use the services of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, despite objections from the farmers, in order to reduce risk which would in turn satisfy the banks that financed the venture. After the first year, the Pool began to deduct 2¢ per imperial bushel for purchase/building of Pool-owned elevators. This levy system was to be used often in the Pool's history. Considering that wheat sold at the time for over $1.00 per bushel, this was a low percentage cost. With this income, the Pool accumulated a $200,000 reserve. Shortly thereafter, Saskatchewan and Manitoba created Wheat Pools of their own. The Pools grew in numbers and political power. In 1928 the combined Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba Wheat Pools were among the biggest business concerns in Canada with a cash turn over of $323 million. The Pool attempted to purchase United Grain Growers Ltd., but the attempt failed. Instead the Wheat Pool began to build more elevators and terminals. By the late 1960s the Wheat Pool had 567 elevators. Alberta Pool Elevator by the rail line in St. Albert, Alberta. In 1925 wheat prices rose to $2.17 then dropped down to $1.36. Fearing market collusion to lower prices, the Pool began to buy wheat futures – worth. This had the effect of raising prices to $1.69, possibly preventing the feared 'bear raid'. As a result, the Pool was extremely profitable. The Pool did so again in 1929 and again in 1930. The first was profitable, but in 1930 (in part due to the stock market collapse in 1929) there were major losses when wheat prices fell under $0.20. The losses far exceeded the profits in 1925 and in 1929 combined, and government loans were necessary to stay solvent. The loans took 17 years to pay off. In order to obtain the government loans, the Pools had to give up overseas direct sales. This caused anger among members and harsh accusations were delivered. Nevertheless, the pool continued to grow quickly in members, wheat capacity and popularity. In 1935, a Canadian Grain Board (now the Canadian Wheat Board) was created by the government as an alternative to pooling. The board had the ability to set a minimum price for wheat, which initially was 87.5¢ per bushel. By 1937, a worldwide poor harvest that had not affected Canada had turned the market around. Prices were well above $1 and the Canadian Wheat Board made a profit for the government. This was short lived when, in 1938, the world harvest was good and prices fell again to 60¢, creating huge losses. World War II During World War II, the Canadian government gave away tons of food as gifts to allies in desperate need for the war effort. Many regions in Europe could not produce food, driving up demand. Price controls helped keep the price down, but it slowly rose from 56¢ in 1940 to $1.55 in 1945. The government issued a guarantee that wheat prices would remain above $1.00 a bushel until 1950. This was understood as part of several considerations given to the farmers in exchange for the low prices forced on them during a period when demand would normally have raised the price significantly. Post World War II Alberta Wheat pool continued to thrive and established itself as a world grain trader, supplier of crop input supplies and began to diversify. As production of grain increased and competition decreased the number of competitors, Alberta Wheat Pool elevators came to dominate the rural Alberta landscape. Corporate mergers In 1998 Alberta Wheat Pool and Manitoba Pool Elevators merged to form Agricore Cooperative Limited. In 2001, United Grain Growers combined its business operations with Agricore Cooperative Ltd. and carried on business as Agricore United, a publicly traded company, no longer a farmer-owned cooperative. In 2007, Agricore United was taken over by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, another publicly traded company. The merged corporation was renamed Viterra. Gallery and locations { Arrowwood. Barons. Bawlf.

For label updates see FDA index page for NDA 021431 Acamprosate is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal. When used alone, acamprosate is not an effective therapy for alcoholism in most individuals; studies have found that acamprosate works best when used in combination with psychosocial support since it facilitates a reduction in alcohol consumption as well as full abstinence. Serious side effects include allergic reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Diarrhea is the most common side-effect. Acamprosate should not be taken by people with kidney problems or allergies to the drug. Until it became a generic in the United States, Campral was manufactured and marketed in the United States by Forest Laboratories, while Merck KGaA markets it outside the US. Medical uses Acamprosate is useful when used along with counseling in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Over three to twelve months it increases the number of people who do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol. It appears to work as well as naltrexone. Contraindications Acamprosate is primarily removed by the kidneys and should not be given to people with severely impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance between 30 mL/min and 50 mL/min). It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to acamprosate calcium or any of its components. Adverse effects The US label carries warnings about increases of suicidal behavior, major depressive disorder, and kidney failure. Adverse effects that caused people to stop taking the drug in clinical trials included diarrhea, nausea, depression, and anxiety. Potential adverse effects include headache, stomach pain, back pain, muscle pain, joint pain, chest pain, infections, flu-like symptoms, chills, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, fainting, vomiting, upset stomach, constipation, increased appetite, weight gain, edema, sleepiness, decreased sex drive, impotence, forgetfulness, abnormal thinking, abnormal vision, distorted sense of taste, tremors, runny nose, coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, bronchitis, and rashes. Pharmacology Acamprosate calcium Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of acamprosate are complex and not fully understood; however, it is believed to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Its activity on those receptors is indirect, unlike that of most other agents used in this context. An inhibition of the GABA-B system is believed to cause indirect enhancement of GABAA receptors. The effects on the NMDA complex are dose- dependant; the product appears to enhance receptor activation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it when consumed in higher amounts, which counters the excessive activation of NMDA receptors in the context of alcohol withdrawal. The product also increases the endogenous production of taurine. Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In chronic alcohol abuse, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms; since GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). One of acamprosate's mechanisms of action is the enhancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction (upregulation) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of delirium tremens and excitotoxic neuronal death. Withdrawal from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activates NMDARs. Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge. The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal. The substance also helps re- establish a standard sleep architecture by normalizing stage 3 and REM sleep phases, which is believed to be an important aspect of its pharmacological activity. Pharmacokinetics Acamprosate is not metabolized by the human body. Acamprosate's absolute bioavailability from oral administration is approximately 11%, and its bioavailability is decreased when taken with food. Following administration and absorption of acamprosate, it is excreted unchanged (i.e., as acamprosate) via the kidneys. Its absorption and elimination are very slow, with a Tmax of 6h and an elimination half life of over 30h. History Acamprosate was developed by Lipha, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA. and was approved for marketing in Europe in 1989. In October 2001 Forest Laboratories acquired the rights to market the drug in the US. It was approved by the FDA in July 2004. The first generic versions of acamprosate were launched in the US in 2013. As of 2015 acamprosate was in development by Confluence Pharmaceuticals as a potential treatment for fragile X syndrome. The drug was granted orphan status for this use by the FDA in 2013 and by the EMA in 2014. Society and culture \\"Acamprosate\\" is the INN and BAN for this substance. \\"Acamprosate calcium\\" is the USAN and JAN. It is also technically known as N-acetylhomotaurine or as calcium acetylhomotaurinate. It is sold under the brand name Campral. Research In addition to its apparent ability to help patients refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is neuroprotective (that is, it protects neurons from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of neurotoxicity).

As a founding member of the Ohio Company of Virginia, and a member of the colonial legislature representing Fairfax County, he also founded the town of Alexandria, Virginia on the banks of the Potomac River in 1749. Washington was the older half-brother of George Washington, the future President of the United States. He was the first of the family to live in the house known as Mount Vernon, which he named after British Admiral Edward Vernon, his commanding officer in the War of Jenkins' Ear. Washington became ill with tuberculosis. He and George travelled to Barbados, hoping that the warm climate would alleviate his ill health. This failed, and Lawrence died at Mount Vernon the following year. Biography=Early years Lawrence was born into the Washington family, being believed to have been born in 1718, the second child of Augustine Washington and his wife Jane Butler Washington (whose first-born son, Butler, died in infancy in 1716.) The family was then living in Westmoreland County, Virginia, along the Potomac River. In 1729, Augustine took Lawrence and younger son Augustine, Jr., to England and enrolled them in the Appleby Grammar School in Appleby-in- Westmorland, Cumbria\\"Founders Online\\", National Archives Augustine would return to Virginia months later and discover that his wife had died, leaving daughter Sarah in the care of the extended Washington family in Westmoreland County. In 1731 he married the young heiress Mary Ball and they had a family. This second Augustine Washington family - including George and his siblings - moved into a home on the Little Hunting Creek plantation in 1735. The foundations of this home can still be seen underneath the present Mount Vernon. Lawrence completed his education and returned to Virginia in 1738, to oversee the management of his father's 2,000-plus acre plantation on the Potomac River at Little Hunting Creek (then in Prince William County; after 1742 Fairfax County). In late 1738, Augustine moved his young family to Ferry Farm, which he had recently purchased on the edge of Fredericksburg in King George County. Prince William County Deed books reveal that the following spring, March 1739, Lawrence Washington began to purchase tracts of land bordering the family's Little Hunting Creek estate: the purchase, in his own name, indicates Lawrence had attained his majority (age 21). Military career In late 1739 the British Parliament decided to raise a \\"Regiment of Foot\\" (infantry) in the American colonies, to be used in the West Indies for the war against Spain, known as the War of Jenkins' Ear. The regiment, to be composed of four battalions, was designated Colonel William Gooch's Regiment of Foot. The company commanders were to be recruited in the colonies and Colonel William Blakeney was sent across the Atlantic with blank commissions, signed by King George II, to be distributed to the various governors. On 10 July 1740, Lieutenant Governor of Virginia William Gooch awarded the senior (of 4) Captain's Commission in one of Virginia's companies to Lawrence Washington: his Commission survives in the archives of the Mt. Vernon estate.MVLA archives, document W-734 The four Virginia Companies mustered at Williamsburg in August 1740, but the transport ships did not set sail for Jamaica until early October. The main British invasion force did not arrive in Jamaica until early January 1741, and the Conjunct Expedition, under the dual command of Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and Brigadier General Thomas Wentworth, got under way in late January. In early February commanders decided to assault the Spanish fortress at Cartagena (in present-day Colombia). At that time, some of the Americans were seconded to Admiral Vernon's warships to be used as Marines. Lawrence was fortunate, as he would later write to his father, to be appointed \\"Captain of the Soldiers acting as Marines\\" on board Vernon's flagship, the 80-gun HMS Princess Caroline.Captain Lawrence Washington letter dated 30 May 1741 from Kingston, Jamaica, to his father, Augustine Washington, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. MVLA archives, PS-835 Because of this service, the 43rd Foot was called \\"Gooch's Marines.\\"Giaffo, Lou. Gooch's Marines, Dorrance Publishing, 2013 Washington survived the Battle of Cartagena de Indias and expeditions against the seaport of New Granada and against Cuba and Panama, which suffered a high rate of casualties, mostly from disease. The assault against Cartagena, in March–April 1741, proved a disaster, as over half of the British force fell ill and died of tropical diseases, chiefly yellow fever.Chartrand, Rene. Colonial American Troops, 1610–1774, (Volume 1), pp. 18–19 Osprey Men-at-Arms #366, Osprey Publishing 2002 The fever predominated amongst the newly arrived troop ships, while the crews on Vernon's warships, having already been in the Caribbean for one year, were largely inured against disease.Crewe, Duncan. Yellow Jack and the Worm: British Naval Administration in the West Indies, 1739–1748. (Liverpool University Press: 1993) p. 76 Washington survived the fevers which killed off nearly 90 percent of the American colonists because of his fortunate (early) transfer from a troop ship to Vernon's flagship, which, having been in the tropics for over one year, had a crew already inoculated against tropical diseases (as well as less crowded conditions aboard ship.) In January 1741, some 3,255 officers and men of Gooch's \\"American Regiment\\" were on board ship in the harbor of Kingston, Jamaica. Not quite two years later, on 24 October 1742, the American survivors could muster only 17 officers and 130 enlisted men, who returned to North America in November and December, accompanied by 268 sick soldiers. On 17 January 1743, The New York Weekly Journal contained a dispatch from Jamaica dated 24 October 1742: > from Jamaica, we are informed that General Wentworth had received Orders to > return to Great Britain with his British Forces and to reduce [disband] the > American Regiment under Colonel Gooch. Each man is to be paid to the 24th of > October and sent home on four transports, viz: one to New York, two to > Virginia, and one to North Carolina. A very melancholy reflection that of > the five hundred men sent from this Province in five vessels at the first > embarkation.The New York Weekly Journal, Monday January 17, 1742/43, page 3, > column 1 Writing a history of British Settlements in North America in 1748, Bostonian Dr. William Douglas said that of 500 men sent from Massachusetts for the expedition, not over 50 returned. Washington also participated in the 1741 British landing at Guantanamo (Cumberland Harbor) Cuba, part of Admiral Vernon's plan—never realized—to attack Santiago de Cuba from the rear (by land) and from the front (by sea). Upon his return to Virginia at the end of 1742, Washington discovered that the post of militia commander, Adjutant, was vacant. He applied for it and was appointed Adjutant, at the rank of Major, by Governor Gooch in Spring 1743. Civilian life Washington was married in July 1743 to Anne Fairfax (1728–1761), the eldest daughter of English-born Colonel William Fairfax of neighboring Belvoir, and his late wife Sarah (née Walker), born to a prominent family in the Bahamas, where Fairfax had been working when they married. The marriage of the 15-year-old Anne to the newly returned 25-year-old army veteran appears to have been prompted by Anne's disclosure to her parents that the family's minister, the Reverend Charles Green of Truro Parish, had taken opportunities with her.Henriques, Peter R. \\"Major Lawrence Washington versus the Reverend Charles Green: A Case Study of the Squire and the Parson,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 100 No. 2 (April 1992), pp. 233–264 About the time of his marriage he began the rebuilding of a house on the site of his father's earlier residence on Little Hunting Creek, naming it Mount Vernon in honor of his wartime commander.\\"American Ancestry\\", Mount Vernon The new county of Fairfax was created (from northern Prince William County) in 1742. Washington was elected to Virginia's House of Burgesses in 1744 as a representative for Fairfax (both the county and the family.) In 1747, he joined with his father-in-law and other prominent landowners and businessmen in the Northern Neck to create The Ohio Company of Virginia, with the intention of opening trade to the American interior linked to the Potomac River. To do so, the Company required an \\"entrepôt\\", a gateway for trade. The site of Hugh West's tobacco warehouse, on the western banks of the Potomac near the mouth of (Great) Hunting Creek, was deemed a suitable location because its deep water access allowed ships from London to sail directly to the wharf. But, the local tobacco planters wanted to site a new town away from the river (and its \\"played out\\" tobacco fields) and further upstream on Hunting Creek.\\"Alexandria Archaeology: Discovering the Decades, 1740s\\", Alexandria, Virginia website During the legislative session of 1748-–49, Washington had the role of promoting the river site and securing the votes necessary to approve a new town on the Potomac, where it would best serve the interests of the Ohio Company. In May 1749, Governor William Gooch signed an Act to establish the town of Alexandria. Washington was granted permission to \\"be absent from the Service of the House, for the Recovery of his Health.\\"Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1748–49,, (Henry Read McIlwaine ed.) p. 385, entry for Wednesday May 3, 1749 Prior to the first public auction of town lots in July 1749, Washington sailed to London to conduct business on behalf of the Ohio Company, and to consult English physicians regarding his health. His younger brother George, an aspiring land surveyor, attended the \\"Public Vendue\\" (auction). He copied the town map, \\"A Plan of Alexandria, Now Belhaven\\", and listed the selling prices of the individual lots for his brother. Although established as \\"Alexandria\\", the town was immediately called \\"Belhaven\\" – in honor of Scottish patriot John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven. In 1751, the town council held the \\"Belhaven Lottery\\" to raise money for a city hall, and George Washington's correspondence throughout the French and Indian War of the late 1750s referred to \\"Belhaven\\". George Washington accompanied his half-brother Lawrence to the warm springs at Bath (present-day Berkeley Springs, West Virginia). Lawrence visited these frequently to improve his health, as he had contracted tuberculosis. In the summer of 1749 Lawrence sailed for England to seek medical advice. In 1751, they took a ship to the island of Barbados hoping that a stay in the warm tropical climate might help Lawrence, who was now very ill with tuberculosis. (This was the only ocean crossing taken by George Washington during his lifetime; his other future travels did not extend beyond the borders of the future United States of America). In Barbados, George Washington contracted smallpox; although he suffered some scarring on his face, his survival meant he was immune to other attacks. Smallpox later caused the most deaths during the American Revolutionary War, and more people died of disease than of battle wounds. Lawrence Washington died of tuberculosis at his Mount Vernon home in July 1752. His widow Anne remarried into the Lee family shortly thereafter. Twenty-year-old George lived at, and managed, the Mount Vernon plantation. Upon the death of Lawrence's widow Anne, George Washington inherited the estate at Mount Vernon. Family Lawrence and Anne had four children together, but none survived childhood; the first three died in infancy: *Jane (Sep. 27, 1744 - Jan. 1745) *Fairfax (Aug. 22, 1747 - Oct. 1747) *Mildred (Sept. 28, 1748 - 1749) *Sarah Washington (Nov. 7, 1750 - 1754) Lawrence Washington military portrait The only surviving portrait of Lawrence Washington is at Mt. Vernon, where George Washington is known to have kept it in his private studio/library on the ground floor: it is the only Washington family portrait honored with a place in the Study. A group of American art experts – including James Flexner – were invited to Mt. Vernon around 1966 to examine the many family portraits owned by George Washington. In their brief examination of the unsigned, undated painting of Lawrence Washington, those social historians noted that his jacket lacked a collar, which was a style of dress popular in England in the 1730s. On that basis alone, they estimated the portrait was painted in England before Lawrence left Appleby School in 1738 (to return to Virginia). This attribution was widely accepted by most Washington scholars, notwithstanding the fact that a few years later (1969) experts in colonial American military history identified the portrait as the finest surviving example of an American Regiment officer's uniform circa 1740–42. Although it is unsigned and undated, the portrait depicts Lawrence in his military uniform as the Adjutant of the Virginia militia. He posed wearing the scarlet \\"undressed\\" frock coat issued him in 1740–41 when he was commissioned as a Captain in the British Army, and the green regimental vest of the \\"American Regiment\\". The vest is trimmed with gold lace (as befits a commanding officer), as is the peak of his tri-corn hat. When experts on Colonial American military history visited Mt. Vernon in 1968–69, they described the portrait as \\"the finest example\\" of an American officer's uniform from the War of Jenkins' Ear, and published their research (Plate 325) in the journal for the study of military uniforms, Military Collector and Historian.John Elting and William Foote were the leading authorities on American colonial military history. Charles McBarron was the foremost artist depicting the early American military. The officer's cockade in his hat appears to be the same one later worn by George Washington when he had his portrait painted in 1772. Lawrence's \\"porthole\\" portrait is nearly identical to that of his neighbor and friend, George Mason of Gunston Hall. The Mason portrait is known to have been painted by the young Philadelphia painter John Hesselius in the spring/summer of 1750 to commemorate his 4 April wedding to Ann Elibeck. An expert on the works of Hesselius (father and son), Professor Roland Fleischer, notes that early works of John Hesselius are characterized by the canvas having been primed with a dark, reddish base paint, and that some of his works were signed, others were not. With Lawrence already in failing health and known to have been contemplating returning to the Caribbean in hopes of recovering his health, the younger painter may have depicted Lawrence in more robust health than was accurate in 1750. With (father) Gustavus Hesselius established in Philadelphia, young John Hesselius made his first attempt at establishing himself as a professional portrait painter by traveling to the Virginia capital of Williamsburg in spring 1750.Doud, Richard K., John Hesselius: His Life and Work (Masters Thesis to the University of Delaware, 1963); (This is the most intensive research done on John Hesselius); National Portrait Gallery research library microfilm. There were no professional portrait painters then working in the prosperous colony and Hesselius likely expected to set up a temporary studio in the capital, counting on business from Virginia's wealthy gentry class who attended the Virginia assembly (the House of Burgesses). Unfortunately for Hesselius, the Virginia legislature did not meet in spring 1752, because of the absence of a (resident) Governor. Hesselius then worked his way back to Philadelphia by visiting the plantation estates of prominent Virginian families. It is likely that, after painting the newlywed George and Ann Mason, Hesselius may have obtained a letter of introduction to paint Lawrence and Anne Washington at Mt. Vernon in 1750. Hesselius would, later, play an indirect role in the portraiture of George Washington, when he took on a young apprentice saddlemaker who aspired to become a painter. The young teen who learned to paint in the Annapolis studio of John Hesselius in 1763 was Charles Willson Peale. In popular culture Lawrence Washington appears in the 2014 Ubisoft action-adventure video game, Assassin's Creed: Rogue as a member of the Templar Order and the first target of the protagonist Shay Patrick Cormac, who kills him during a garden party at Mount Vernon. He also appears in the AMC television series, Turn, as inspiration to General George Washington while he is hallucinating from \\"melancholia\\". He is pictured in a scene in Barbados while ill from tuberculosis and being visited by a young George Washington. He is again depicted later that episode in a forest scene inspiring General George Washington. The younger Washington is lamenting that he has many shortcomings militarily compared to his older brother. Lawrence counsels him that George did things he would not dare, among them, the famous raid across the Delaware River.

The first English language translation of the play (sometimes known by the alternative title The King of England’s Daughter) appeared in 1960. The play is based on historical events and centres on Joan, Lady of Wales, the illegitimate daughter of King John of England and her marriage to Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (also known as Llywelyn Fawr or Llywelyn the Great). It is set at the royal home at Abergwyngregyn, on the north coast of Gwynedd at Easter in 1230. In the play William de Braose, a young Marcher Lord, is discovered with Siwan in Llywelyn's bedchamber. De Braose is hanged for adultery. In Saunders Lewis' earlier work including the play Blodeuwedd (1948), he had been increasingly using the themes and characters of Welsh myths and historical events as the inspiration for his work.

Moisture recycling is thus a component of the hydrologic cycle. The ratio of the locally derived precipitation (P_{L}) to total precipitation (P) is known as the recycling ratio, \\\\rho: \\\\rho = P_{L}/P. The recycling ratio is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between land surface hydrology and regional climate. Land use changes, such as deforestation or agricultural intensification, have the potential to change the amount of precipitation that falls in a region. The recycling ratio for the entire world is one, and for a single point is zero. Estimates for the recycling ratio for the Amazon basin range from 24% to 56%, and for the Mississippi basin from 21% to 24%.Moisture recycling The concept of moisture recycling has been integrated into the concept of the precipitationshed. A precipitationshed is the upwind ocean and land surface that contributes evaporation to a given, downwind location's precipitation. In much the same way that a watershed is defined by a topographically explicit area that provides surface runoff, the precipitationshed is a statistically defined area within which evaporation, traveling via moisture recycling, provides precipitation for a specific point.

Professional wrestling career=Early career Alvarez and his friends formed a backyard wrestling promotion called Youth Wrestling Foundation, which aired on Seattle's Public Access Channel from 1993 to 1995. Years later, Alvarez began working as a referee for local independent shows, which eventually led to him returning to wrestling, when he replaced another wrestler who did not show up for an event. Afterwards, Alvarez began wrestling more regularly, at first for free. Alvarez's career has mostly been spent wrestling for various independent promotions in the Pacific Northwest. He appeared in the first match of the short-lived Portland Wrestling television revival in 2003, losing to The Grappler. He was accompanied by a blonde valet, Miss Rent-to-Own (Auto), who was named after one of the TV show's sponsors. Return to the ring A fundraiser was held in which Alvarez stated that if it reached $400, he would do one more match with friend and former professional wrestler Vince Verhei. He also stated that anyone who donated at least $25 would get a special DVD. The amount was surpassed and in fact exceeded $3000, with donation amounts ranging from one cent to $250, and the scheduled match was posted on YouTube on September 17, 2006. The DVD was released on December 8, 2006. Verhei defeated Alvarez to win the YWF Title, the main belt in Alvarez's original backyard wrestling organization in the mid-1990s. Feud with \\"Sweet & Sour\\" Larry Sweeney On March 17, 2007, Alvarez battled Larry Sweeney to a no contest for Sweeney's ICW-ICWA Texarkana Television Championship. Alvarez executed a German suplex, but both men's shoulders were pinned and the ref could not conclusively determine a winner. Alvarez agreed to a challenge made on Figure Four Daily once Sweeney agreed to \\"pay $7,500\\" to Alvarez. The title match was part of the inaugural Fight Sports Midwest card in Portage, Indiana. Sweeney and Alvarez's promos are available on YouTube. Alvarez had announced that a rematch with Larry Sweeney, set to take place on June 13, 2007 in Portage, Indiana, had been canceled. Alvarez stated that the rematch would take place sometime in 2007. Alvarez further claimed that after beating Sweeney for his Texarkana Television Championship he was planning to rename it the Frank A. Gotch Memorial Collar & Elbow Pacific Coast Championship. Fight Sports Midwest announced on September 27, 2007 that the Alvarez/Sweeney rematch would take place at the November 18, 2007 CHIKARA show at the former ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Rematch announcement at CHIKARAFans message board The rise of Ted \\"The Trailer\\" McNaler After Alvarez favorably reviewed the Derby City Wrestling television show in Figure Four Weekly, announcers Kenny Bolin and Timmy Baltimore mentioned his reviews on the air, holding up a copy of the newsletter. DCW wrestler Ted \\"The Trailer\\" McNaler then came to the announcers' table, complaining that Alvarez disparaged McNaler's physique and intelligence. He then proceeded to challenge Alvarez to a match, insisting that he had an athletic physique. In subsequent weeks, he continued the challenges, insulting Verhei and Alvarez's \\"Granny\\" (Alvarez's actual grandmother and an occasional guest on The Bryan and Vinny Show), and was shown humorously attempting to raise money to bring \\"Chico\\" to Louisville, Kentucky, where DCW is taped. Alvarez has said that he was not told of McNaler's challenge until it was taped, and that initially there were no plans to have a match with McNaler; his comments on the matter were limited to mentions on his podcast and newsletter. But in September 2007, Alvarez, in a video that aired on DCW television, turned down McNaler's challenge, citing his new writing career, and asked him to not insult his grandmother. McNaler responded by further insulting Alvarez.

After a grueling fifty-eight-minute battle, Alvarez managed to make McNaler submit to the sharpshooter. Alvarez then traveled to the former ECW Arena for an event promoted by Chikara on November 18, and defeated Larry Sweeney with a superkick to win the ICW/ICWA Texarkana TV Title. He lost it back to Sweeney on April 25, 2008 in a four-way match at IWC's Super Indy VII in Pittsburgh, which also included Delirious and Ruckus. 2009 comeback Alvarez returned to wrestling on November 7, 2009 after taking a year off following a back injury.http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/11262/124/ 11/7/09 TCW match results He defeated Mike Santiago at the Tulalip Championship Wrestling event in Marysville, Washington, at the Pacific Rim.

On April 4, 2010, Alvarez wrestled Lance Storm, who worked under a mask as the Ideal Canadian, winning with a superkick. In August 2010, Alvarez lost a Loser Leaves Town for Three Months match to Christopher Ryseck. It was his last match with the promotion. 2014 comeback Alvarez returned after four years on August 16, 2014 for a match with Buddy Wayne at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. It was the first-ever match for the debuting Wrestle-Sport promotion. Mason Ryan, Chris Masters and Adam Pearce wrestled in the main event. Alvarez defeated Wayne with a senton bomb after sixteen minutes. 2018 comeback On July 14, 2018, Alvarez returned to the ring to team with Filthy Tom Lawlor under their new team name, The Chop and Roll Express, against The Rock and Roll Express at a Black Label Pro show. The Rock and Rolls won when Alvarez was pinned with a sunset flip.

In media  In June 2005, Alvarez launched Figure Four Online, a subscription website run primarily by himself and his brother-in-law Tony Leder. Several times a week, Alvarez and Vince Verhei produce their own Internet podcast, The Bryan and Vinny Show, where the pair review professional wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA) programming, in an observational comedic style similar to that found in the newsletter. The Monday night edition of The Bryan and Vinny Show or Wrestling Observer Radio is free for anyone to download, while other editions done during the week are available only to subscribers of the web site. On June 12, 2008, Dave Meltzer's Wrestling Observer website merged with Figure Four Online, and both newsletters are now available online through that website. Alvarez also hosts Wrestling Observer Live, a talk show where he interviews guests related to professional wrestling or MMA, and Wrestling Observer Radio with Dave Meltzer. Alvarez and Meltzer also do occasional bonus shows covering breaking news. Other features found on Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online include access to a growing archive of past Figure Four Weekly and Wrestling Observer newsletters, and an active discussion forum. Alvarez hosted his own 900-number wrestling hotline through Figure Four Weekly in the mid-1990s, then shut it down and moved to Meltzer's 900-number Wrestling Observer Hotline. Originally Meltzer hired Alvarez to take calls for him, but in 1999 recruited him as a co-host after getting an offer to do a show for eYada, the first-ever live streaming Internet radio station, based out of New York City. The original Wrestling Observer Live was the most-listened-to program on the network and the final program to air before the station closed down. Meltzer invited him to be a guest on the first several episodes of Wrestling Observer Live on Eyada as a co-host to bounce news stories off of at the beginning of the program. Later, Alvarez became a full-time co-host. When Eyada went out of business in 2001, the show eventually moved to the Sports Byline USA radio network. Meltzer eventually gave up hosting duties to devote more time to MMA columns for Yahoo.com and Alvarez took over as lead host.http://media001.f4wonline.com/free/091713bvshow.mp3 The show continues to air Monday through Friday at 3:00 p.m.http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top- stories/3-news/41018-big-announcement-wrestling-observer-live-moving-to-six- days-a-week-starting-february-23rd-at-12-pm-pt3-pm-et and Sundays from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. with Alvarez and Mike Sempervive. It is the most-listened-to wrestling/MMA program in the world, airing on Sports Byline over-the-air radio affiliates, SiriusXM, TuneIn Radio, iHeart Radio, the Armed Forces Network, and online both live and in replay form on the Wrestling Observer website. Alvarez also hosted After Dark, a weekend podcast covering various non- wrestling fringe topics including science and technology, UFOs, cryptozoology and the paranormal. Alvarez is a former columnist for British wrestling and MMA magazine Fighting Spirit, as well as a former online correspondent for The Fight Network and the internet radio show Wrestling Weekly.  The Death of WCW  Alvarez's book, The Death of WCW, which he co-wrote with R. D.

It lies about five miles (8 km) from Folkestone and the Channel Tunnel, on the road passing through the Elham Valley. At the 2011 Census the population of Etchinghill was included. The Nailbourne stream begins in the village and flows north through the Valley, to become one of the tributary streams of the Great Stour. The hamlet of Ottinge lies to the NE on the road to Elham. Lyminge is home to the Grade II* listed Sibton Park, now owned by the Holiday Property Bond but previously a school. The village is surrounded by farmland and ancient forests. There is a wide variety of flora and fauna in the surrounding area, including badgers, various species of deer along with wild boar which are thought to have escaped from farmed populations. Lyminge was a royal centre of the Kingdom of Kent of Anglo-Saxon England and a church was founded in 633. Church North side of the Church of St Mary and St Ethelburga One of the oldest standing structures in the village is the Parish Church of St Mary and St Ethelburga, originally founded in 633. The current church building dates back to c. 965, with additions dating to the late 12th century, the 14th century, and the early 16th century, and is a Grade I listed building. Æthelburh of Kent (Ethelburga) was the daughter of the Christian King Æthelberht of Kent. She married King Edwin of Northumbria in 625, and his conversion was a condition of their marriage. After Edwin was killed at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633, Ethelburga returned to Kent to become abbess of a new convent, Lyminge Abbey. When she died in 647 she was venerated as a saint. In 2019 an archaeological excavation at the church uncovered the remains of the original Anglo-Saxon church, founded by Queen Ethelburga in 633, which is located by the south porch of the current church. The church was first uncovered during the second half of the 19th century by Canon Robert Jenkins (1815–1896), rector of Lyminge from 1854 until his death. The remains show an apsidal chancel separated from the nave by a triple arch with two central columns. The mortar used in the walls of the Saxon church are a distinctive pink colour as it was made from crushed Roman bricks, which indicates that stonemasons from continental Europe were involved in the construction of the church. A number of graves were uncovered in the chancel of the Saxon church during the 2019 excavations, but these are believed to postdate the demolition of the church during the late 11th or early 12th century. Part of a porticus has been uncovered on the north side of the apse, which may have been where Queen Ethelburga was originally buried, although it is recorded that her remains were moved to Canterbury at a later date. Archaeology Saxon church founded by Æthelburh of Kent in 633, excavated in 2019 Lyminge has been a focus of archaeological work for over a half a century. In December 1953 two inhumation burials were discovered there by workmen working for farming contractors, and subsequent excavations led by Alan Warhurst resulted in the discovery of a 6th-century Jutish cemetery () containing 44 graves. The grave assemblages were remarkable, although not unusual for this period, and contained a lot of high status jewellery, weapons such as spear-heads, swords and shield bosses and some rare glass claw beakers of exceptional quality and condition. There was a major archaeological find in October 2012 when the foundations of an Anglo-Saxon feasting hall were excavated on the village green by a team from the University of Reading, led by Gabor Thomas, working with local archaeologists and villagers and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Guided by a ground-penetrating radar survey the hall was identified as measuring 21 metres by 8.5 metres and would have been large enough to hold at least 60 people. A decorated and gilded horse harness, broken in antiquity, was found in the foundations together with pieces of jewellery, bone combs and a well-preserved manicure set – three little bronze rods, probably for cleaning fingernails or ears, strung on to a piece of wire. The site also yielded quantities of glass, some evidently scavenged from nearby Roman sites and melted down to make glass bead jewellery. Sport Lyminge is home to Sibton Park Cricket Club who play in Division 1 of the Kent Cricket League and have an active Junior Section which caters for boys and girls from a wide area in and around Lyminge. Transportation 200px The Elham Valley Railway ran from Canterbury to Folkestone through the village from 1887 until eventually closing in 1947. The station building exists today as the library, situated in The Sidings, off Station Road. The Stagecoach bus route 17 serves the village and connects it to Folkestone and Canterbury. There is typically one bus an hour in each direction on weekdays and Saturdays, and a bus every two hours in each direction on Sundays. In addition, Route 18 links the village to Canterbury - via Bossingham, also Hythe Kent. Bus runs Monday to Saturday only, at irregular intervals.

The 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis (also known as the 1988 judicial crisis) was a series of events that began with United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of the Lord President of the Supreme Court, Tun Salleh Abas, from his seat. The Supreme Court in the years leading up to 1988 had been increasingly independent of the other branches of the government. Matters then came to a head when Mahathir Mohamad, who believed in the supremacy of the executive and legislative branches, became Prime Minister.Means, p. 237. Many saw his eventual sacking of Salleh Abas and two other Supreme Court judges as the end of judicial independence in Malaysia. Since 1988, there have been regular calls for an official review of the government's actions throughout the crisis. In 2008, newly appointed de facto Law Minister Zaid Ibrahim said the government had to make an open apology to the sacked judges, calling the government's actions during the crisis \\"inappropriate\\". Not long after, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the crisis one which the nation had never recovered from, and announced ex gratia compensation for the sacked and suspended judges. Judicial intervention in a political dispute In 1987, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) — a leading party in the governing Barisan Nasional coalition – held elections for its numerous offices. For the first time in twelve years, the incumbent President, Mahathir, was challenged. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah was the candidate of \\"Team B\\" for the Presidency, taking on Mahathir, whose camp was labelled \\"Team A\\".Means, Gordon P. (1991). Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation, p. 201. Oxford University Press. . There was an intense campaign to win the support of the roughly 1,500 delegates from party branches all over the country, who would elect the party officers. Razaleigh's supporters expected him to win, and at the UMNO General Assembly shortly after the votecounting was completed, rumours spread that Razaleigh had won. However, the official results declared Mahathir the winner, with 761 votes to Razaleigh's 718. The Team A candidate for Deputy President, Ghafar Baba, defeated Musa Hitam of Team B as well, and 16 of the 25 seats on the UMNO Supreme Council also went to Team A.Means, p. 204. Razaleigh's supporters were upset by the election, which they insisted had to have been rigged. Their anger was exacerbated by Mahathir, who went on to purge all Team B members from the Cabinet.Means, pp. 204–205. As a result, 12 UMNO members filed a lawsuit in the High Court, seeking a court order to void the election results and pave the way for a new election. The plaintiffs alleged that 78 of the delegates had been selected by branches not registered with the Registrar of Societies, and as a result were not eligible to vote. They also claimed that certain documents related to the election had been \\"tampered with\\". Although Razaleigh was not among the twelve plaintiffs, he was widely believed to be funding and co-ordinating the suit.Means, p. 206. Later, one of the twelve withdrew from the case, but the remaining eleven continued to press on. The High Court eventually gave the parties a two-week deadline to reach an out of court settlement. An UMNO \\"Unity Panel\\" was formed to handle the negotiations and reach a compromise. However, it soon became clear that the differences were intractable – Team B would settle for no less than a new election, while Team A insisted that the suit be withdrawn and a \\"face-saving\\" solution be reached which would allow some Team B members to remain in the party. Eventually the eleven plaintiffs declared they would seek a final judgement from the court.Means, pp. 215–216. This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed on several previous occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists critical of the government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, \\"The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [the government and Parliament] go along, we are going to lose our power of legislation.\\"Means, p. 216. Mahathir also lashed out at \\"black sheep [judges] ... who want to be ... fiercely independent,\\" accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.Means, pp. 217–218. Harun was thus forced to make the final call on the case of the \\"UMNO 11\\". Although most of the evidence they had presented was not contested, the UMNO defence argued that not all possible remedies within UMNO had been exhausted. The plaintiffs, however, insisted that the fact that at least 30 unregistered branches had sent delegates to the UMNO elections should have been enough to nullify their results. In the end, Harun dismissed the suit, citing Article 41 of the Societies Act 1966, which stated any society would automatically become \\"unlawful\\" if any of its branches were not registered with the Registrar of Societies. As a result, Harun declared he had no choice but to declare UMNO \\"an unlawful society\\", thereby rendering \\"[w]hat happened in 1987\\" a nullity. In his decision, Harun blamed Parliament for forcing his hand: \\"If the old law was in existence... [one could] apply the common law principle, but here it seems the Parliament, to ensure strict compliance with the law, has made this provision look harsh.\\"Means, pp. 218–219. As soon as the decision was made public, Mahathir assured UMNO members that as the decision was based on minor \\"technicalities\\", the party could easily be restored as a lawful society. He also reminded the public that this did not threaten his status as Prime Minister, as only a no-confidence vote could lawfully remove him from power.Means, p. 223. Within a fortnight of Harun's decision, Mahathir announced the registration of UMNO Baru (New UMNO). UMNO Baru's leadership was almost entirely composed of Team A members, who proceeded to spend the next few months transferring the assets of the \\"old\\" UMNO to UMNO Baru.Means, pp. 224, 225, 226. The UMNO 11 pursued their case to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, still seeking to hold new elections for the \\"old\\" UMNO and having its lawful status restored. However, their appeal was rejected.Means, p. 227. Razaleigh then decided to form a new party focused on the \\"spirit of 1946\\" — the year UMNO had been founded.Means, p. 228. UMNO Baru in turn decided that the \\"Baru\\" was superfluous, and officially dropped it from its name, in effect claiming to be the true successor to UMNO instead of Razaleigh's party, which would eventually call itself Semangat 46 (Spirit of 46).Means, p. 230. Constitutional amendments The \\"UMNO 11\\" case was just one of a number which had irritated Mahathir and the government. The case of the two journalists mentioned earlier had begun when John Berthelsen and Raphael Pura authored a series of articles on financial transactions of dubious ethical and legal nature carried out by government officials. The Asian Wall Street Journal which published them was promptly banned from the country, and Mahathir in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister had Berthelsen's and Pura's work permits revoked. However, the Supreme Court overturned the cancellation of Berthelsen's work permit because he had not been given a chance to answer the charges of the government. As a result, the ban on the Asian Wall Street Journal was also lifted.Means, p. 140, 236. In a different case, the Supreme Court used its power of judicial review, and nullified amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gave the Attorney-General the power to initiate criminal proceedings in the High Court without first going to a Magistrate's Court. After Operation Lalang in 1987, where the government detained several political dissidents without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA), the High Court granted Karpal Singh's application to be released from detention due to technicalities in the way he had been detained.Means, pp. 236–237. This last case did it for Mahathir. The following week, he submitted several constitutional amendments to Parliament, divesting the courts of the \\"judicial power of the Federation\\" and giving them only such judicial powers as Parliament might grant them. In justifying the amendments, Mahathir stated: \\"...the courts have decided that in enforcing the law they are bound by their interpretations and not by the reasons for which Parliament formulated these laws ... lately the judiciary had seen fit to touch on matters which were previously regarded as solely within the executive's jurisdiction.\\" The Lord President of the Supreme Court, Tun Salleh Abas, was pressured by his fellow judges to respond to the government's actions. Salleh decided to convene a meeting of all 20 judges from the Supreme and High Courts in the capital of Kuala Lumpur. At the meeting, they agreed not to publicly reply to Mahathir's criticisms. Instead, they wrote a confidential letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) and the Malay rulers, expressing their grievances. The proposed letter, which was unanimously approved, was written by Salleh Abas. The letter stated the judges' disappointment \\"with the various comments and accusations made by the Honourable Prime Minister against the Judiciary,\\" but did not demand specific action be taken – instead, it ended with an expression of \\"hope that all those unfounded accusations will be stopped\\".Means, p. 238. Suspension and removal of Tun Salleh Abas and other judges In 1988, Tun Salleh Abas was brought before a tribunal convened by the then Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad on the grounds of misconduct. The tribunal was chaired by Tun Hamid Omar. In response to the tribunal, Tun Salleh Abas filed a suit in the High Court in Kuala Lumpur to challenge the constitutionality of the tribunal. While proceeding with the suit, Tun Salleh Abas applied for an interim stay against the tribunal until 4 July 1988. The request was denied. Later however, five judges of the Supreme Court convened and granted Tun Salleh Abas an interlocutory order against the tribunal. Upon receiving the order, Tun Salleh Abas' solicitors proceed to the Parliament to present the chairman of the tribunal the interlocutory order. The gate leading to the Parliament however was locked and Tun Salleh Abas' representative had to call in the police to be guaranteed a passage into the Parliament. Eventually, the order was presented to the tribunal chairman. Soon after, the five judges were suspended. The judges were Tan Sri Azmi Kamaruddin, Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader, Tan Sri Wan Hamzah Mohamed Salleh, Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh and Datuk George Seah.\\"Salleh's case is closed\\" , The Star. Accessed 15 April 2007. This effectively suspended the Supreme Court, and made it so that the challenge toward the legality of the tribunal could not be heard. The tribunal later removed Tun Salleh Abas from his office, along with Tan Sri Wan Sulaiman and Datuk George Seah, whereas the other three judges were later reinstated. The irregular dismissal of Tun Salleh Abas led the Bar Council of Malaysia to refuse recognising the new Lord President. Legacy A major critic to Mahathir's actions include Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. In a New York Times article, he was said to be \\"disgusted\\" at the actions. His views however were criticised by the then Education Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who claimed that the Tunku was ″a grand old man who has done his bit.″ Mahathir's supporters insisted that it had liberated the Malaysian judiciary from a colonial mindset. The sacking of several justices was justified by claims that these judges had been abusing public funds for their personal expenses – such as the purchase of luxury furniture from Italy. It was also claimed that the sackings had eliminated deadwood and improved efficiency in the courts, as evinced by a reduction in their backlog.Maidin, Zainuddin (1994). The Other Side of Mahathir, pp. 99, 101. Utusan Publications & Distributors. . Call to revisit the case Mahathir Mohammed stepped down from the premiership in 2003, having chosen Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to succeed him. In 2006, the relationship between the two became less than warm as Mahathir started to criticise the latter's policies. During this period, many begin calling for the judiciary or government to review the decision against the sacked judges. Among the loudest advocates of the review was Tun Salleh Abas himself. The administration dismissed such calls. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz, who was then de facto Law Minister, said that he was not convinced of the need to review the case.Lisa Goh. Nazri: I'm not convinced of need to review 1988 crisis The Star. 12 September 2006. After the 2008 general election which saw heavy losses for BN, Abdullah reshuffled his Cabinet. Within days of his appointment, new de facto Law Minister Zaid Ibrahim stated that the government had to openly apologise for its handling of the crisis, calling it one of his three main goals: \\"In the eyes of the world, the judicial crisis has weakened our judiciary system.\\" However, he rejected the idea of reviewing the decision: \\"I am not suggesting that we re-open the case. I am saying that it's clear to everyone, to the world, that serious transgressions had been committed by the previous administration. And I believe that the prime minister is big enough and man enough to say that we had done wrong to these people and we are sorry.\\" The Bar Council welcomed the proposal. Newly appointed Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Shahrir Abdul Samad also voiced support: \\"The Government has apologised for so many other things to the people, such as the untimely destruction of temples and other issues. So, why not an apology to a former Lord President?\\" Zaid's proposal was criticised by former Bar president Param Cumaraswamy, who insisted that Mahathir's administration, not Abdullah's, should assume responsibility: \\"Those who perpetrated the transgressions are still alive and they must be called to account for their conduct and seek forgiveness from the six valiant judges, their families and Malaysians generally for the sacrilege committed to the temple of independent justice.\\" He also proposed that the government compensate the three sacked judges since \\"reinstatement of the three dismissed is no longer possible.\\" Karpal Singh, lawyer and opposition member of Parliament, agreed: \\"Calling for the present administration to apologise is not a step in (the) right direction. It is not the present administration that convened those tribunals.\\" Instead, Karpal suggested that a Royal Commission be set up. A few days later, The Malaysian Insider, a news website, reported that the Cabinet was critical of the proposal, citing the potential for legal liability if the government admitted wrongdoing. Zaid said that the proposal was still being considered, and that \\"we have to wait.\\" In April 2008, at a dinner with 600 members of the Bar and leaders from the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition, Abdullah acknowledged the impact of the crisis: He then announced that the government would make ex gratia goodwill payments to the sacked and suspended judges: \\"I do not presume to equate your contribution, pain and loss with mere currency but I hope you could accept this as a heartfelt and sincere gesture to mend what had been.\\" However, he refused to explicitly apologise for the events of 1988 or otherwise review them, saying it would \\"prolong the sense of crisis\\". Abdullah also announced his intention to set up a judicial appointments commission as part of his plans to reform the judicial system. Two of the six judges involved in the 1988 crisis – Tun Salleh Abas and Azmi Kamaruddin – and the families of the other four were present. Zaid welcomed Abdullah's announcement in spite of the lack of a formal apology, saying: \\"(One) can say sorry in other ways.\\" George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: \\"Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This is not the end of the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much).\\" Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: \\"I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier.\\" Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: \\"I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer.\\" 2018: Mahathir's new claims In January 2018, Tun Dr Mahathir (by then leader of Pakatan Harapan after leaving UMNO) denied responsibility for removing Tun Salleh Abas, insisting this was done under instructions from the then Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Iskandar of Johor. The former Prime Minister said he was prepared to swear on the Quran that his name had been used by the Attorney-General then, Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman, in order to distance the Agong from the matter. He also claimed there had been a letter with remarks from the Agong regarding Salleh, but said this has since been lost. He also maintained that Salleh's removal was prompted by the Agong's displeasure over a letter Salleh had allegedly written to the monarch regarding construction noises from the Ruler's nearby private home, which was also copied to the other Malay Rulers. Mahathir claimed that the Agong called him as prime minister and said he wanted Salleh sacked and passed him a copy of the Abas's alleged letter in question. Dr Mahathir claimed that the matter was discussed by his Cabinet then, which decided on a tribunal to remove Salleh as Lord President. Former Attorney General Abu Talib Othman agreed that Dr Mahathir was not responsible for dismissing the Lord President. Othman clarified that he saw the note written, signed by the then Agong, asking then PM Mahathir to remove the Lord President and advised the PM on procedure, but denied Mahathir's claims that his name was being used to distance the Agong. Othman suggested that Mahathir was merely acting on the insistence of the then Yang di-Pertuan Agung himself in setting up of the dismissal tribunal via the provisions and channels of the Constitution as the PM and Attorney General had no powers to dismiss a Lord President. Abu Talib alleged that the Agong was displeased with Salleh's letter complaining about the criticisms levelled at the judiciary by the executive. When asked about the revelations, Tun Salleh Abas stated that it was time to move on from the sacking which took place 30 years earlier, and that the crisis was merely being politicised in the lead up to the 14th General Election (where Mahathir was running as the opposition candidate for Prime Minister, which he successfully won later in May).

D. Carr: \\"Joan [Siwan\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: OUP, 2004), Retrieved 2 February 2019.] Early life Joan should not be confused with her half-sister, Joan, Queen consort of Scotland. Little is known about her early life. Her mother's name is known only from Joan's obituary in the Tewkesbury Annals, where she is called \\"Regina Clementina\\" (Queen Clemence); there is no evidence that her mother was in fact of royal blood. Joan may have been born in France, and probably spent part of her childhood there, as King John had her brought to the Kingdom of England from Normandy in December 1203, in preparation for a marriage alliance to Prince Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. Thomas Pennant, in \\"Tours in Wales\\", Volume 2, published London, 1810, writes : \\"It is said that Llewelyn the Great had near this place [Trefriw] a palace; ... The church of Trefriw was originally built by Llewelyn, for the ease of his princess, who before was obliged to go on foot to Llanrhychwyn, a long walk among the mountains.\\" Marriage Joan was betrothed to Llywelyn the Great in 1204, and the marriage is thought to have taken place in 1205, although some of the annals of the abbey of St Werburgh in Chester say that it occurred in 1204. She and Llywelyn had at least two children together: *Elen ferch Llywelyn (Helen or Ellen) (1207–1253), married (1) John the Scot, Earl of Chester and (2) Robert II de Quincy *Dafydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1212–1246) married Isabella de Braose, died at Abergwyngregyn. Some of Llywelyn's other recorded children may also have been Joan's: *Gwladus Ddu (1206–1251), who married (1) Reginald de Braose and (2) Ralph de Mortimer, with whom she had issue. *Susanna, who was sent to England as a hostage in 1228. *Angharad ferch Llywelyn *Marared/Margaret (born c.1202) who married (1) Sir John de Braose (called Tadody), grandson of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. She married (2) Sir Walter de Clifford and had children by both husbands. Joan often mediated between her husband and her father. According to Brut y Tywysogion (The chronicle of the princes), when John was successfully campaigning in North Wales, \\"Llywelyn, being unable to suffer the king's rage, sent his wife, the king's daughter, to him, by the counsel of his leading men, to seek to make peace with the king on whatever terms he could.\\" In April 1226 Joan obtained a papal decree from Pope Honorius III, declaring her legitimate on the basis that her parents had not been married to others at the time of her birth, but without giving her a claim to the English throne. Adultery At Easter 1230, William de Braose, who was Llywelyn's prisoner at the time, was discovered with Joan in Llywelyn's bedchamber. William de Braose was hanged on 2 May 1230, according to local folklore at Abergwyngregyn; the place was known as Gwern y Grog. A letter from Nicholas, Abbot of Vaudy, suggests that the execution took place at Crogen near Bala (crogi means to hang).The Acts of Welsh Rulers: 1120–1283, ed. Huw Pryce. University of Wales Press, 2005. . p. 429. Accessed 6 October 2015. Joan was placed under house arrest for twelve months after the incident. She was then, according to the Chronicle of Chester, forgiven by Llywelyn and restored to favour. She may have given birth to a daughter early in 1231. Joan was never called Princess of Wales, but in Welsh \\"Lady of Wales\\". Death and burial Joan died at the royal home at Abergwyngregyn, on the north coast of Gwynedd, in 1237. Llywelyn's great grief at her death is recorded; he founded a Franciscan friary in her honour on the seashore at Llanfaes, opposite the royal residence. This was consecrated in 1240, shortly before Llywelyn died. It was destroyed in 1537 by Henry VIII of England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A stone coffin originally identified as Joan's can be seen in St Mary's and St Nicholas's parish church, Beaumaris, Anglesey. Above the empty coffin is a slate panel inscribed: \\"This plain sarcophagus, (once dignified as having contained the remains of Joan, daughter of King John, and consort of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of North Wales, who died in the year 1237), having been conveyed from the Friary of Llanfaes, and alas, used for many years as a horsewatering trough, was rescued from such an indignity and placed here for preservation as well as to excite serious meditation on the transitory nature of all sublunary distinctions. By Thomas James Warren Bulkeley, Viscount Bulkeley, Oct 1808\\" The slate panel at Beaumaris In recent years doubt has been cast on the identity of the woman shown on the coffin lid, which is not thought to belong to the coffin on which it rests. Experts have suggested the costume and style of carving belong to a much later decade than the 1230s when Joan died, although the coronet would indicate a member of the royal family. Eleanor de Montfort is thought the likeliest alternative. In literature *Joan and her affair with William de Braose is the subject of Saunders Lewis's Welsh-language verse play Siwan. *Edith Pargeter's novel The Green Branch is set in Wales and the Welsh Marches in 1228–1231, when Llewelyn ruled Gwynedd and most of the rest of Wales. *Joan is the main character of Sharon Kay Penman's novel Here Be Dragons, which uses the alternative spelling \\"Joanna\\".

The upgrade was part of the London Ringways Plan to build motorways throughout London to ease congestion in the central area. Under the Ringways Plan, the North Circular Road was the northern section of Ringway 2. Most of the Ringways Plan was cancelled in 1973 and the upgrade of the A406 took place in a piecemeal fashion during the following three decades. Although much of the road is now grade-separated dual carriageways, the improvements have not been carried out to motorway standards and there are still a number of sub-standard sections and many junctions with minor roads. One section of the M15 was constructed in the early 1970s in conjunction with the M11 motorway. The section of A406 between M11 junction 4 and the Redbridge interchange with the A12 was signed as the southern end of the M11 and the Redbridge junction was signed as M11 junction 3. This was a temporary \\"virtual\\" designation to avoid driver confusion, because, at the time of opening, although it was legally part of the M15,Pathetic Motorways – M15 traffic entering this section of road northbound from the Redbridge Roundabout could continue only onto the M11 and traffic heading southbound on the M11 could enter only the section to Redbridge. To have used two motorway numbers for what was effectively one route would have caused difficulties. As the A406 motorway upgrade was not constructed, the designation has never been officially signed and the M15 was abolished when the A406 Redbridge to A13 road was opened.

He belonged to the Colony of Virginia's landed gentry and was a planter and slaveholder. Family Augustine Washington was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on November 12, 1694 to Capt. Lawrence Washington, a militia captain and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and Mildred Warner. His paternal grandparents were Lt. Col. John Washington (c. 1631–1677) and his first wife, Anne Pope. Life Augustine was four years old when his father died. He inherited about on Bridges Creek in Westmoreland County; his sister Mildred inherited what was called the Little Hunting Creek property; they both inherited slaves. When Washington came of age (and into his inheritance) in 1715, he married Jane Butler, an orphan who had inherited about from her father. The young couple settled on the Bridges Creek property. Washington was active in the Anglican Church and in local politics. He took the oath as justice of the peace for the county court in July 1716, and served as county sheriff. In 1718, Washington purchased land on Popes Creek, abridging his property on Bridges Creek. About 1726, he had a new house built there (later called Wakefield). In the same year, he purchased the Little Hunting Creek property from his sister Mildred. Washington and his first wife, Jane Butler, had four children, only two of whom (Lawrence and Augustine Jr.) lived to adulthood. In 1725, Augustine entered into an agreement with the Principio Company of England to start an iron works on Accokeek Creek in Stafford County. After Jane's death in November 1728 or 1729, Washington married Mary Ball in 1731, and in 1735, the family moved to the Little Hunting Creek property, which was closer to the Accokeek Furnace. In 1738, Augustine Washington purchased the 150-acre Strother property across the Rappahannock River and moved the family there at the end of that same year. Legacy After Washington's death in 1743 at the age of 48, his son George inherited the former Strother property and its slaves. As he was only 11 years old, his mother Mary managed the property for him until he came of age. She lived on the property until 1772 when she was 64. George then moved her to a house in Fredericksburg. Lawrence inherited the Little Hunting Creek property and renamed his property Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Edward Vernon, with whom he had served in the Royal Navy in 1741 during the Battle of Cartagena de Indias during the War of Jenkins' Ear. Augustine Jr. inherited the Popes Creek property and slaves. At his death, Augustine Washington Sr. held a total of 64 slaves who were assigned among the various plantations.\\"Slavery at Popes Creek Plantation\\", George Washington Birthplace National Monument, National Park Service, accessed April 15, 2009 According to Augustine's will, if Lawrence died without children, the Little Hunting Creek property would be given to Augustine Jr. with the stipulation that he must then give Popes Creek to George. If Augustine Jr. did not want the Little Hunting Creek property, it would then be inherited by George. At Lawrence's death, Augustine Jr. did not want to give up Popes Creek, and Lawrence's only surviving child Sarah lived only until 1754; therefore, George Washington ultimately inherited the Little Hunting Creek property. Lawrence Washington's widow Ann had a life interest in the Little Hunting Creek plantation. As she remarried and was not living at Mount Vernon, she leased the property to George beginning in 1754. Upon her death in 1761, George Washington inherited the plantation outright.

It is similar to anodizing, but it employs higher potentials, so that discharges occur and the resulting plasma modifies the structure of the oxide layer. This process can be used to grow thick (tens or hundreds of micrometers), largely crystalline, oxide coatings on metals such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium. Because they can present high hardness and a continuous barrier, these coatings can offer protection against wear, corrosion or heat as well as electrical insulation. SEM. winch drum undergoing PEO processing. Below; a finished winch drum installed on a yacht. thumb The coating is a chemical conversion of the substrate metal into its oxide, and grows both inwards and outwards from the original metal surface. Because it grows inward into the substrate, it has excellent adhesion to the substrate metal. A wide range of substrate alloys can be coated, including all wrought aluminum alloys and most cast alloys, although high levels of silicon can reduce coating quality. Process Metals such as aluminum naturally form a passivating oxide layer which provides moderate protection against corrosion. The layer is strongly adherent to the metal surface, and it will regrow quickly if scratched off. In conventional anodizing, this layer of oxide is grown on the surface of the metal by the application of electrical potential, while the part is immersed in an acidic electrolyte. In plasma electrolytic oxidation, higher potentials are applied. For example, in the plasma electrolytic oxidation of aluminum, at least 200 V must be applied. This locally exceeds the dielectric breakdown potential of the growing oxide film, and discharges occur. These discharges result in localized plasma reactions, with conditions of high temperature and pressure which modify the growing oxide. Processes include melting, melt-flow, re-solidification, sintering and densification of the growing oxide. One of the most significant effects, is that the oxide is partially converted from amorphous alumina into crystalline forms such as corundum (α-Al2O3) which is much harder. As a result, mechanical properties such as wear resistance and toughness are enhanced. Equipment used The part to be coated is immersed in a bath of electrolyte which usually consists of a dilute alkaline solution such as KOH. It is electrically connected, so as to become one of the electrodes in the electrochemical cell, with the other \\"counter-electrode\\" typically being made from an inert material such as stainless steel, and often consisting of the wall of the bath itself. Potentials of over 200 V are applied between these two electrodes. These may be continuous or pulsed direct current (DC) (in which case the part is simply an anode in DC operation), or alternating pulses (alternating current or \\"pulsed bi-polar\\" operation) where the stainless steel counter electrode might just be earthed. Coating properties One of the remarkable features of plasma electrolyte coatings is the presence of micro pores and cracks on the coating surface. Plasma electrolytic oxide coatings are generally recognized for high hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. However, the coating properties are highly dependent on the substrate used, as well as on the composition of the electrolyte and the electrical regime used (see 'Equipment used' section, above). Even on aluminium, the coating properties can vary strongly according to the exact alloy composition. For instance, the hardest coatings can be achieved on 2XXX series aluminium alloys, where the highest proportion of crystalline phase corundum (α-Al2O3) is formed, resulting in hardnesses of ~2000 HV, whereas coatings on the 5XXX series have less of this important constituent and are hence softer. Extensive work is being pursued by Prof. T. W. Clyne at the University of Cambridge to investigate the fundamental electrical and plasma physical processes involved in this process, having previously elucidated some of the micromechanical (& pore architectural), mechanical and thermal characteristics of PEO coatings.

It is located in the extreme southeastern corner of the city, along the northern shores of Lake Ontario. Lakeview was known for the 4 Sisters, the four smokestacks of the former Lakeview Generating Station. They were called the 4 Sisters because the generating plant actually had eight boilers and two boilers were 'sistered' to a common stack. The generating station was demolished in 2007, about a year after the four stacks were demolished, which occurred on the morning of June 12, 2006. At 493 ft each they were easily the tallest structures in the area. Along the shore of Lake Ontario, Lakeview is the home of the Port Credit Yacht Club, Lakefront Promenade Marina, Arthur P. Kennedy Water Treatment Plant, and G. E. Booth (Lakeview) Wastewater Treatment Plant. The area is also home to the Lakeview Branch Library, and 3 high schools: Cawthra Park Secondary School, Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School, and St. Paul Secondary School. Many parks run along Lake Ontario, including well-lit baseball diamonds used by many junior leagues. History Lakefront Promenade Park MSSC offices at Enola Ave in the southern portion of Lakeview Lakeview is part of the Mississauga Purchase of 1806, lands acquired by the Crown from the Mississauga First Nation. Portions of the eastern section of the Lakeview was part of the Colonel Smith Tract, which was added to lands Colonel Samuel Smith had acquired in 1801 in neighbouring Etobicoke. The area later became Toronto Township which was restructured into the Town of Mississauga in 1968. Lakeview was the site of the Long Branch Armory, which included a rifle range, training facilities and the Long Branch Aerodrome, the first commercial air training airport in Canada. The airport was run by the Curtis Aviation School, and was located west of the namesake Long Branch neighbourhood in Toronto. The Lakeview location is documented by the presence of Aviation Road running south off Lakeshore Road just west of Cawthra Road. The site is further acknowledged by a historic plaque.National Historic Plaque #1166 The site was home for several World War II arms and munitions plants during World War II. One large munitions factory in Lakeview was staffed almost exclusively by women during World War II.  Long Branch Aerodrome  The Long Branch Aerodrome was located west of Long Branch on the Federal Government lands in Toronto Township (today's Mississauga). The aerodrome was situated on a 100-acre property on Lakeshore Road just west of Dixie Road. The Long Branch Aerodrome has the distinction of being the first Aerodrome in Canada and home to Canada's first aviator training school. It opened on May 20, 1915, by Curtiss Aeroplanes and Motors Company for the Royal Flying Corps. Aircraft such as the Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jenny\\" soon became a common sight at the airfield, which included three aircraft hangars. In January 1917, the newly designated Royal Flying Corps, Canada, the forerunner to the Royal Canadian Air Force, opened the RFC Training Centre at Long Branch. The Long Branch training centre also provided instruction on flying boats at nearby Hanlan's Point on Toronto Islands, the first seaplane base in Canada. By July 1917, the flight school re-located to the Armour Heights Aerodrome. Long Branch became the Cadet Ground Training School for the Royal Flying Corps. Both the school and the aerodrome closed in 1919. During World War II, the former aerodrome served initially as Non-Permanent Active Militia's No 21 Training Centre and then as an army small arms training centre (Long Branch Rifle Ranges). After the war, the Lakeview Armoury was established on the site but was demolished in the 1950s. Not the slightest trace remains of the airfield today. From 1962 - 2005, the waterfront portion of the property was the location of Ontario Power Generation's Lakeview Generating Station. In September 1969, a plaque was erected at the site to commemorate Canada's first Aerodrome. Small Arms Limited, Long Branch Arsenal Adjacent to the west side of Marie Curtis Park (now Marie Curtis Park West or Lakeshore Park) in Toronto Township is the former site of the Small Arms Limited Long Branch Arsenal. The Federal Government had owned the lands south of Lake Shore Road, between the Etobicoke River to just west of Cawthra Road, from the late 1800s into the early 20th-Century. The first land purchase was made in 1889 for a rifle range, to replace the one at New Fort York. The military use was expanded for World War I, becoming the summer quarters for several regiments and a staging area for troops to go overseas. The Ordnance Branch of the Department of National Defence authorized the construction of a factory on the site in 1940. After transfer to the Department of Munitions and Supply, a Crown Corporation, Small Arms Ltd. was formed to operate the facility. By June 1941, the first five rifles had been produced. Huge quantities of British- pattern military small arms were manufactured there during the Second World War, including the No.4 MkI* Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifle, and the Sten submachine gun (or machine-carbine). Small Arms Ltd. ceased operations at the end of December 1945. Beginning January 1, 1946, operations continued as the Small Arms Division, Canadian Arsenals Limited. The factory was closed June 30, 1976. The property was later used by Canada Post as a distribution centre. The factory complex was demolished and the \\"Arsenal Lands\\" are now being used for the stockpiling of landfill for use in future aquatic park development. The lands are slated to be eventually become part of Lakeshore Park. The buildings of the office complex at the foot of Dixie Road were saved for public use, while only the water tower remains from the factory complex. Lakeview Waterfront Connection Prior to 1958, the lands used by Lakeview GS and the old rifle range had been farmland since the 1870s. The Halliday and Hamilton families purchased several plots from the Samuel Smith Tract, which was once owned by Samuel Smith, to the west of the rifle range. The rifle range had been occupied by the Canadian Army since 1891 when they moved from the old Garrison Common in Toronto. After 1958 infilling was needed to create the outer edge of the power plant and including some portions south of the old rifle range. In September 2016 the City of Mississauga, along with Peel Region, and local MPP Charles Sousa announced plans to redevelop the area surrounding the old Lakeview Generating Station into a mixed-use area along with a waterfront park by 2023-2026 timeframe. Peel Region and Credit Valley Conservation Authority will manage the project and Toronto and Region Conservation Authority will provide assistance. Serson Creek and Applewood Creek will each have a naturalized mouth featuring wetlands. The area south and east of the G.E. Booth Wastewater Treatment Plant will be infilled (similar to Leslie Spit in Toronto) in to create a new waterfront park featuring, cobbled shoreline and three man-made rock islands that will act as break walls.http://lakeviewwaterfrontconnection.ca/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/LWC-PIC-NOV16-2015-Posters-Web.pdf The new parkland area will have trails that will connect to neighbouring Marie Curtis Park in Toronto as well as existing parks (R.K.McMillan Park, A.E. Crookes Park, Lakefront Promenade, Douglas Kennedy Park and Lakeview Park) in Mississauga. The area of the old generating station will be reserved for future residential and commercial use but will allow space near the water to be accessible and connected by trails to the park to the east.

Seasoning is generally done at the table according to personal taste by adding salt, ground black pepper, red pepper, minced garlic, or chopped spring onions. It is a local dish of Seoul.Kim, Violet \\"Food map: Eat your way around Korea\\" CNN Go. 6 April 2012. Retrieved 2012-04-12 Seolleongtang is typically simmered over a low flame over a period of several hours to an entire day, to allow the flavor to be gradually extracted from the bones. It has a milky off-white, cloudy appearance and is normally eaten together with rice and several side dishes; the rice is sometimes added directly to the soup.Seolleongtang at Doosan Encyclopedia History and etymology In the Joseon dynasty, Koreans regularly made nationwide sacrifices to their ancestors, such as Dangun (the legendary founder of the kingdom of Gojoseon). The nationwide sacrifice was called Sŏnnongje (hangul: 선농제; hanja: 先農祭, Sŏnnong meaning \\"venerated farmer\\"), and the altar for the sacrifice was called Sŏnnong dan (hangul: 선농단; hanja: 先農壇), which dates back to the Silla Dynasty. Seonnong dan at Doosan Encyclopedia King Seongjong had visited the sacrifice himself, and had eaten a meal with the people of Joseon. To increase the food supply in Joseon, King Seongjong ordered them to invent dishes that could feed the maximum number of people using the fewest ingredients, and seonnongtang (tang meaning \\"soup\\") was one of these. Another historical opinion precedes the Joseon dynasty concerning the origin of seolleongtang. According to this, the food was originated by the Mongolian invasion of Koryo in 13 BC. Mongolian food \\"Sulen\\" is sliced and boiled beef with green onions, which developed into seolleongtang in Korea. Do, H. (2011). 전쟁이 요리한 음식의 역사[History of war and food]. Seoul: Sidaeuichang Seonnongtang is now called seolleongtang for easier pronunciation. The phonetic values have changed as follows: * Seonnongtang (선농탕, Sŏnnongt'ang) > Seollongtang (설롱탕, Sŏllongt'ang) > Seolleongtang (설렁탕, Sŏllŏngt'ang) The first change is a consonant liquidization making the two \\"N\\" sounds into softer \\"L\\" sounds for easy pronunciation. The second change is a vowel harmonization of the \\"O\\" sound affected by the \\"Ŏ\\" sound. Among common misbeliefs related to the dish, the name may come from its snowy white color and hearty taste, so seolleongtang was named \\"雪濃湯\\" in hanja (literally \\"snowy thick soup\\").

The Saint John’s Bible is the first completely handwritten and illuminated Bible commissioned by a Benedictine Abbey since the invention of the printing press. Beginning in 1970, master calligrapher Donald Jackson expressed in media interviews his lifelong dream of creating an illuminated Bible. Following a Saint John’s University-sponsored calligraphy presentation at the Newberry Library in Chicago in 1995, Jackson discussed a handwritten Bible with Fr. Eric Hollas, OSB, former executive director of the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. Between 1996 and 1997, Saint John’s explored the feasibility of the Bible project, Jackson created first samples, and theologians developed the illumination schema. The Saint John’s Bible was officially commissioned in 1998 and funding opportunities were launched. The public was introduced to the project in 1999 and production was completed in 2011, with the final word penned in May 2011 and touch-up work completed by December 2011. The Saint John’s Bible is divided into seven volumes and is two feet tall by three feet wide when open. The Bible is made of vellum, with 160 illuminations. The version of the Bible used is the New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (NRSV-CE). A copy of the Bible has been presented to the Pope at the Vatican in several volumes, with the final volume being presented on 17 April 2015. The scriptorium of The Saint John’s Bible is located in Monmouth, Wales. Mission \\"At the onset of a new millennium, Saint John’s University and the monks of Saint John’s Abbey sought to ignite the spiritual imagination of people throughout the world by commissioning a work of art that illuminates the world today.\\" Techniques Donald Jackson, official scribe to Her Majesty's Crown Office at the House of Lords, created a new script specifically for this project. The creators of The Saint John’s Bible used a mixture of techniques used in the creation of ancient illuminated manuscripts (handwritten with quills on calf-skin vellum, gold and platinum leaf and hand-ground pigments, Chinese stick ink) and modern technology (computers used to plan the layout of the Bible and line-breaks for the text). Volumes The Saint John’s Bible consists of seven volumes: # Gospels and Acts (completed in May 2002): 25+ illuminations, including opening illuminations to each gospel # Pentateuch (completed in August 2003): Illuminated text from the first 5 books of the Old Testament # Psalms (completed in April 2004): Illuminations include the digital voice prints of songs from various ethnicities/religious backgrounds # Prophets (completed in April 2005): Includes Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Micah, Amos, Daniel, Zechariah, and Baruch # Wisdom Books (completed in July 2006): Includes Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Job, Wisdom, and Sirach # Historical Books (completed in March 2010): Largest page count, 25+ illuminations, includes Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Judith, Esther, Ruth, Tobit, 1st and 2nd Maccabees # Letters and Revelation (completed 2011) The Committee on Illumination and Text During production, a team of scholars and theologians gathered weekly to develop the theological content behind the illuminations. This included not only developing the schema for the illuminations (i.e., which passages would be illuminated), but also identifying underlying themes and elements for the artists to incorporate. The Committee on Illuminations and Text met in Collegeville, Minnesota, while much of the artwork was produced in Wales, resulting in a transatlantic collaboration as drafts were passed between the two groups. Michael Patella OSB, chair of the Committee on Illumination and Text, explained the underlying purpose of their work: \\"The illuminations are not illustrations. They are spiritual meditations on a text. It is a very Benedictine approach to Scriptures.” The Heritage Edition The Heritage Edition of The Saint John’s Bible is the full-size fine art reproduction of the original. Measuring two feet tall by three feet wide when open, it is the exact size of the original manuscript. Each volume of the Heritage Edition is signed by the chief scribe and illuminator, Donald Jackson. The edition is limited to 299 signed and numbered seven-volume sets and contains the same volumes as the original. Many of the illuminations are touched-up by hand, including the burnishing of gold leaf. In addition, an eighth volume of commentary that places The Saint John’s Bible in its historical context and describes several of the illuminations will accompany the volumes. Institutions and individuals around the world have acquired approximately 100 of the 299 available sets of the Heritage Edition. The Heritage Edition can be viewed by the public at locations in the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the Irish Republic. Trade Edition The Trade Edition of The Saint John’s Bible are smaller, printed copies of the seven volumes available for purchase. They are roughly the size of coffee table books, measuring 10\\" x 15.2\\". Seeing the Word In collaboration with Saint John's School of Theology and Seminary, curriculum has been developed that aims to educate people on The Saint John’s Bible and its underlying goal of igniting the spiritual imagination. Seeing the Word, co-produced by Liturgical Press, is a collection of resources promoting meditation on the Scripture and illuminations through the prayer process of visio divina (based on lectio divina). Other recently produced handwritten/illuminated Bibles Early in the marketing campaign, the commission responsible for The Saint John’s Bible made the claim that it would be the first handwritten Bible in 500 years to the best of their knowledge. The commission was then made aware that several other Bibles had been completed within the time frame, and in Spring 2004 (between the April and May mailings of advertising for the Bible), the phrase “commissioned by a Benedictine Monastery” was added to the advertising and official website. At least one other privately illuminated manuscript, reproducing selections from the Bible - the Pepper Bible - preceded The Saint John’s Bible in this timeframe.

The poetry of Alphonsus de Guimaraes is substantially mystical and involved with Catholicism. His sonnets display a classical structure, and are profoundly religious. They become increasingly sensitive as he explores the meaning of death, of the impossible love, of solitude and of his inadequacy regarding the world. However, the mystical tone marks in his works a feeling of acceptance and of resignation towards life, suffering and pain. Another characteristic aspect of his work ids the use of spirituality in relation to the feminine figure, which is considered to be an angel, or a celestial being. As a result of that, Guimaraes shows himself not one as a Symbolist but also a follower of Neo-romanticism. His works, predominantly poetic, made him one of the main Symbolist authors in Brazil. In reference to the city he spent most of his life in, he is also called the \\"loner of Mariana\\", his \\"ivory tower of Symbolism\\" (\\"o solitário de Mariana\\" and \\"torre de marfim do Simbolismo\\", respectively, in Portuguese). Biography Alphonsus Guimarães. Afonso Henriques da Costa Guimarães was born on July 24, 1870, in the city of Ouro Preto in Minas Gerais. He was son of a Portuguese trader, Albino da Costa Guimarães and Francisca de Paula Guimarães Alvim, niece of the Romantic writer Bernardo Guimarães. He enrolled in 1887 in the engineering course of his city. During his early life he suffered the premature loss of his cousin and fiancée, Constança, a fact that deeply affected him emotionally and physically. Sick, he moved to São Paulo in 1891 to study Law in the University Largo do Francisco. There he collaborated with the local newspapers Diário Mercantil, Comércio de São Paulo, Correio Paulistano, O Estado de S. Paulo and A Gazeta and attended Vila Kyrial, where the young Symbolists gathered. After three years, he returned to Ouro Preto, graduating in Law in 1894. In 1895, in the city Rio de Janeiro, Guimaraes met João da Cruz e Sousa, a poet whom he already admired, and became a close friend of him. In 1897, he marries Zenaide de Oliveira. In the year of 1899, he premiered in literature with two volumes of verses: Septenário das Dores de Nossa Senhora e Câmara Ardente and Dona Mística; both showing clear Symbolistic influences. In 1902 he published Kiriale, under the pseudonym of Alphonsus de Guimaraens; this opened opportunities in the literary world, giving him recognition, however restricted. He had been working as substitute judge in Conceição do Serro, but in 1903 he lost his position, which led him to grave financial difficulties. After refusing a prominent position in the newspaper A Gazeta, Alphonsus de Guimaraens was appointed to direct the political newspaper of Conceição do Serro, where he would collaborate with his brother Archangelus de Guimaraens, Cruz e Souza and José Severino de Resende.

Additional . He broke into the comics field in 1934 with brief stints as the letterer for the comic strip Minute Movies by Ed Wheelan, and as an assistant on the Joe Jinks comic strip; in the early 1940s, United Features Syndicate hired him to draw Joe Jinks.Harvey, R.

At the same time he also worked as an \\"opaquer\\" for Fleischer Studios. In 1940 Weiss created the syndicated comic strip It Never Fails, but asked to be released from his contract the following year, explaining later, \\"I never was a good gag man....I can come up with a gag here and there, but not on a steady basis.\\" That same year he attended the Art Students League of New York in order to study figure drawing with George Bridgman; future fellow cartoonists in the same class were Bob Lubbers and Stan Drake. Weiss was the inker and assistant on cartoonist Lank Leonard's Mickey Finn from 1936 to 1943, and again from 1960 on. He took over the strip following Leonard's retirement in 1968, continuing through the final Sunday strip on December 21, 1975, and the daily strip's finale on July 31, 1976.Morris Weiss at the Lambiek Comiclopedia.

About this time Weiss was contacted separately by both Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, the creators of Superman, each of whom were interested in collaborating with him on a comic strip. At various times Weiss turned down opportunities to continue strips such as Terry and the Pirates and Nancy after the departure of their creators. He occasionally assisted Al Smith on Mutt and Jeff. In 1955, he began drawing the Adventures of Pinky Lee, a comic written by Stan Lee. Additional . Weiss wrote the dramatic continuity for Joe Palooka from about 1962 to 1970, with Tony DiPreta drawing the strip. Weiss befriended a host of notable artists, including James Montgomery Flagg, who drew Weiss's portrait, Charles Voight, Milton Caniff, Ernie Bushmiller, and Edwina Dumm. As a member of the National Cartoonists Society, he proposed the idea of a charity fund for members on hard times, which Alex Raymond developed into the Milt Gross Fund for Indigent Cartoonists.Morris Weiss interview, Alter Ego #43 (December 2004), pp. 7-22.

It was first produced at the Dorset Garden Theatre, and starred Elizabeth Barry as Monimia, Thomas Betterton as Castalio and Jo. Williams as Polydore. It precedes Venice Preserv'd and is therefore the first of Otway's two famous tragedies. Written in blank verse, it is the play that made Otway famous. The Orphan remained a stock piece on the stage until the 19th century. Thomas Otway was purported to have been deeply in love with Mrs. Barry, and it has been suggested that this play was inspired by this unrequited love.  Plot  Half the youth of Europe is at war but Acasto, a nobleman retired from court and living in the country, encourages his sons Castalio and Polydore to stay home, study art and politics, and avoid the company of women. As well as having a daughter, Serina, Acasto is the guardian of a young girl, Monimia. Both Castalio and Polydore are in love with Monimia but Castalio, being the first-born twin, claims to have the right to woo her first. He secretly contracts himself to Monimia in marriage but Polydore overhears and makes plans to replace Castalio on the wedding night. Using the wedding-night signal of \\"three soft strokes on the chamber door\\" he is allowed access to Monimia's bedroom. When Castalio then attempts to enter the room using the same signal he is believed to be Polydore, and turned away. When everything is discovered and explained the next day, there is only the prospect of death for those involved. In the end, Polydore provokes Castalio into a duel and runs into his brother's sword on purpose, after which Monimia takes a fatal draught of poison and Castalio stabs himself.  Prologue  In the prologue, Otway praises the Duke of York and congratulates him on his safe return from Scotland: ::The baneful cloud's withdrawn, ::And happiness again begins to dawn; ::Since back with joy and triumph he is come, ::That always drove fears hence, ne'er brought 'em home. ::Oft has he ploughed the boist'rous ocean o'er, ::Yet ne'er more welcome to the longing shore, ::Not when he brought home victories before; ::For then fresh laurels flourished on his brow, ::And he comes crowned with olive branches now. ::Receive him! Oh, receive him as his friends; and dedicates the published edition of the play to the Duchess of York, suggesting strong Tory sympathies.

It provides federal funding for conservation easements and fee simple purchases. Program purpose To ascertain and protect environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to nonforest uses Development of the nation's forested areas poses an increasing threat to maintaining the integrity of our country's valuable forest lands. Intact forest lands supply timber products, wildlife habitat, soil and watershed protection, aesthetics, and recreational opportunities. However, as these areas are fragmented and disappear, so do the benefits they provide. While local governments commonly guide development away from the most sensitive areas through traditional land use controls (like zoning and performance standards), sometimes these measures are not sufficient to fully protect the forested component of our natural resource base. The Forest Legacy Program (FLP), a federal program in partnership with states, supports state efforts to protect environmentally sensitive forest lands. Designed to encourage the protection of privately owned forest lands, FLP is an entirely voluntary program. To maximize the public benefits it achieves, the program focuses on the acquisition of partial interests in privately owned forest lands. FLP helps the states develop and carry out their forest conservation plans. It encourages and supports the acquisition of conservation easements, legally binding agreements transferring a negotiated set of property rights from one party to another, without removing the property from private ownership. Most FLP conservation easements restrict development, require sustainable forestry practices, and protect other values. Program description The Forest Legacy Program is a partnership between participating States and the USDA Forest Service to identify and protect environmentally important forest land that is threatened by conversion to nonforest uses. Conservation easements are the primary tool used to achieve this goal. Priority is given to lands that have important scenic or recreational values; riparian areas; fish and wildlife values, including threatened and endangered species; or other ecological values. Program characteristics The program helps States and regions identify important forest areas. When conservation easements are used, the land remains privately owned. Other tools include full-fee purchase, voluntary deed restrictions, covenants, and agreements. The program is based on a \\"willing seller and willing buyer\\" concept. State and local partners select priority tracts in cooperation with the Forest Service. The interests in land may be held by the Federal government, or by the State or a unit of local government if the State chooses to select the State Grant Option as authorized by the 1996 Farm Bill. When the Federal government holds the easement, State or local units of government agree to administer the lands or interests in lands. The lands and interests are held in perpetuity. There is no loss of the Federal investment resulting from change of ownership. Forest Stewardship Plans that meet the landowner's objectives for natural resource management are prepared on all privately owned tracts. The tracts acquired can remain \\"working forests\\" and can forever provide forest resources to meet the needs of the local community and the Nation FLP partner roles The Federal role The significance of the public benefits of a particular forest ranges from local to national. Larger forests tend to be nationally significant because the values they provide are becoming more rare. Extensive forest areas are often subject to the additional challenge of multiple ownerships and numerous political jurisdictions. Through the Forest Legacy Program, the Federal government helps State and local governments look beyond their political boundaries to identify important forest areas. The Federal government provides oversight, and financial and technical assistance to help protect important forests. The State role States integrate partner resources to cooperatively protect and maintain a forest land base. The lead agency, usually the State forestry organization, carries out the FLP in the State. Responsibilities include the following: Collect information to identify and delineate important forest areas that may be selected as Forest Legacy Areas. Consult with the State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee to achieve program purposes. Address land protection and forest management issues. Conduct land acquisition activities Integrate policies and incentives to conserve a forest land base. Hold and administering the lands or interests in land that enter the Forest Legacy Program. Monitor tracts for program compliance. The State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee Role The State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee is identified in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act. The committee's consulting and recommending duties for the Forest Legacy Program are identified in the act and the FLP guidelines, and include the following: Prioritize lands for inclusion in the FLP. Establish eligibility criteria and recommends Forest Legacy Areas in the Assessment of Need process. Advise the State lead agency in order to achieve Forest Legacy Program objectives. The Nongovernmental Organization (Land Trust) Role Nongovernmental organizations, specifically land trusts or similar organizations, have a distinct relationship with the FLP. Because of their compatible interest in protecting land for conservation purposes, land trusts can be a primary contact with landowners to negotiate the purchase of conservation easements and to monitor the conservation easements once they are enrolled in the FLP. Lands acquired by or donated to land trusts may be counted toward the non- Federal cost-share amount of total program costs, provided the interests in lands contribute to the goals of the Forest Legacy Program and the lands are located within a Forest Legacy Area. The Landowner Role Landowner participation in the FLP is voluntary. A landowner joins the program either by conveying interests in lands to achieve the conservation objectives of the FLP or by purchasing or inheriting land that has already been committed to an FLP conservation easement. The landowner becomes a primary practitioner in maintaining the forest land base by implementing management activities to conserve the values for which the land entered the program. Program activities Forest Legacy complements private, federal and state programs focusing on conservation in two ways. First, FLP directly supports property acquisition. Additionally, FLP supports efforts to acquire donated conservation easements. FLP funded acquisitions serve public purposes identified by participating states and agreed to by the landowner. On May 18, 2009 US Forest Service chief announced land grants to protect more than of forest in northern Vermont. The land is going to be conserved with the help of a $1.8 million under the Eden Forest project.http://www.fox44.net/Global/story.asp?S=10380946 Eligibility Participation in Forest Legacy is limited to private forest landowners. To qualify, landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition. The federal government may fund up to 75% of program costs, with at least 25% coming from private, state or local sources. In addition to gains associated with the sale or donation of property rights, many landowners also benefit from reduced taxes associated with limits placed on land use. Program administration The USDA Forest Service administers the Forest Legacy Program in cooperation with State Foresters. The state grant option allows states a greater role in implementing the program. FLP also encourages partnerships with local governments and land trusts, recognizing the important contributions landowners, communities and private organizations make to conservation efforts.

A CFR is conventionally expressed as a percentage and represents a measure of disease severity. CFRs are most often used for diseases with discrete, limited-time courses, such as outbreaks of acute infections. A CFR can only be considered final when all the cases have been resolved (either died or recovered). The preliminary CFR, for example, during an outbreak with a high daily increase and long resolution time would be substantially lower than the final CFR. Terminology The mortality rate — often confused with the CFR — is a measure of the relative number of deaths (either in general, or due to a specific cause) within the entire population per unit of time.For example, a diabetes mortality rate of 5 per 1,000 or 500 per 100,000 characterizes the observation of 50 deaths due to diabetes in a population of 10,000 in a given year. (See Harrington, Op. cit..) A CFR, in contrast, is the number of dead among the number of diagnosed cases only. Sometimes the term case fatality ratio is used interchangeably with case fatality rate, but they are not the same. Case fatality ratio is the comparison between two different case fatality rates, expressed as ratio. It is used to compare different diseases or to assess the impact of interventions. From a mathematical point of view, CFRs, which take values between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%, i.e., nothing and unity), are actually a measure of risk (case fatality risk)— that is, they are a proportion of incidence, although they don't reflect a disease's incidence. They are neither rates, incidence rates, nor ratios (none of which are limited to the range 0-1). They do not take into account time from disease onset to death.Entry “Case fatality rate” in Last, John M. (2001), A Dictionary of Epidemiology, 4th edition; Oxford University Press, p. 24.Hennekens, Charles H. and Julie E. Buring (1987), Epidemiology in Medicine, Little, Brown and Company, p. 63. Infection fatality rate Like the case fatality rate, the term infection fatality rate (IFR) also applies to infectious disease outbreaks, but represents the proportion of deaths among all infected individuals, including all asymptomatic and undiagnosed subjects. It is closely related to the CFR, but attempts to additionally account for inapparent infections among healthy people. The IFR differs from the CFR in that it aims to estimate the fatality rate in both sick and healthy infected: the detected disease (cases) and those with an undetected disease (asymptomatic and not tested group). (Individuals who are infected, but show no symptoms, are said to have \\"unapparent\\", \\"silent\\" or \\"subclinical\\" infections and may inadvertently infect others.) By definition, the IFR cannot exceed the CFR, because the former adds asymptomatic cases to its denominator. Example calculation If 100 people in a community are diagnosed with the same disease, and 9 of them subsequently die from the effects of the disease, the CFR would be 9%. If some of the cases have not yet resolved (neither died nor fully recovered) at the time of analysis, a later analysis might take into account additional deaths and arrive at a higher estimate of the CFR, if the unresolved cases were included as recovered in the earlier analysis. Alternatively, it might later be established that a higher number of people were infected with the pathogen, resulting in an IFR lower than the CFR. Real-world examples The following examples show some CFRs for diseases in the real world: *The CFR for the Spanish (1918) flu was <2.5%, but about 0.1% for the Asian (1956-58) and Hong Kong (1968-69) flus, and <0.1% for other influenza pandemics. * The current best estimate of the CFR for COVID-19 according to the Johns Hopkins University is 2.8% in the US. \\"\\" John Hopkins University, October 5th 2020. *Legionnaires' disease has a CFR of ≈15%. *Yellow fever has a CFR of about 3–7.5%. *Bubonic plague has the best prognosis of the three main variants of plague, but if left untreated, has a CFR >60%. *Ebola virus is among the deadliest viruses, with a CFR as high as 90%. *Naegleriasis (also known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis), caused by the unicellular Naegleria fowleri, nearly always results in death, with a CFR >99%. *Rabies virus is almost invariably fatal if left untreated, and so has a CFR approaching 100%; however, patients generally respond well to prompt post-exposure prophylaxis. *Prion diseases are progressive and always fatal, regardless of treatment.

Michael Halliday's 1990 speech New ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics is often credited as a work which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the ecological context and consequences of language. Among other things, the challenge that Halliday put forward was to make linguistics relevant to overarching contemporary issues, particularly the widespread destruction of ecosystems. The main example Halliday gave was that of \\"economic growth\\", describing how \\"countless texts repeated daily all around the world contain a simple message: growth is good. Many is better than few, more is better than less, big is better than small, grow is better than shrink\\", which leads to environmentally destructive consequences. Overview Since Halliday's initial comments, ecolinguistics has developed in several directions, employing a range of linguistic tools to investigate language in an ecological context. The International Ecolinguistics Association characterizes ecolinguistics in these terms: > \\"Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining > interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The > first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as > part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends > on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key > ecological issues, from climate change and biodiversity loss to > environmental justice.\\" In this way, the 'eco' of ecolinguistics corresponds to ecology in its literal sense of the relationship of organisms (including humans) with other organisms and the physical environment. This is a sense shared with other environmental humanities disciplines such as ecocriticism and ecopsychology. The term 'ecolinguistics' has also been used with a metaphorical sense of 'ecology', for example in 'linguistic ecology', in ways which do not include consideration of other species or the physical environment. This is currently less prevalent. Another aspect of ecolinguistics is linguistic diversity and the embedding of traditional environmental knowledge in local languages. In 1996, David Abram's book, The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World, described how the wider environment (or 'the more than human world') shapes language in oral cultures, helping people attune to their environment and live sustainably within it. According to Abram, writing has gradually alienated people in literate cultures from the natural world, to the extent that \\"our organic attunement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs\\".Abram, David (1996): The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World. pg.267. New York, Pantheon Books. As dominant languages such as English spread across the world, environmental knowledge embedded in local cultures is lost. There are two main areas of interest for ecolinguistics. The first can be described as 'The environmental analysis of language' and the second as 'language diversity'. Environmental analysis of language The environmental analysis of language draws on a wide range of linguistic tools including critical discourse analysis, framing theory, cognitive linguistics, identity theory, rhetoric and systemic functional grammar to reveal underlying worldviews or the 'stories we live by'. The stories we live by are cognitive structures in the minds of individuals or across a society (social cognition) which influence how people treat each other, other animals, plants, forests, rivers and the physical environment. The stories are questioned from an environmental perspective with reference to an environmental framework (or ecosophy), and judged to encourage people to protect ecosystems, or encourage behavior which damages those ecosystems. Ecolinguistics attempts to make a practical difference in the world through resisting destructive stories and contributing to the search for beneficial new stories to live by.Stibbe, Arran (2015) Ecolinguistics: language, ecology and the stories we live by. London: Routledge Stories which ecolinguists claim are destructive relate to consumerism, unlimited economic growth, advertising, intensive farming, and those which represent nature as a machine or a resource. Using \\"positive discourse analysis\\", ecolinguistics has also searched for new stories to live by through exploring nature writing, poetry, environmental writing and traditional forms of language around the world Stibbe, Arran (2018) Positive discourse analysis: re-thinking human ecological relationships. In: A. Fill and H. Penz, eds. The Routledge Handbook of Ecolinguistics. London: Routledge. . This form of analysis started with the application of critical discourse analysis to texts about environmentalism, in order to reveal hidden assumptions and messages and comment on the effectiveness of these in achieving environmental aims (e.g. Harré et al. 1999).Harré, Rom; Brockmeier, Jens and Peter Mühlhäusler (1999) Greenspeak: a Study of Environmental Discourse. London: Sage. It then developed to include analysis of any discourse which has potential consequences for the future of ecosystems, such as neoliberal economics, consumerism, gender, politics, agriculture and nature. The cognitive approach and the term 'stories we live by' were introduced by Arran Stibbe in 2015, with eight kinds of story: ideology, framing, metaphor, evaluation, identity, conviction, salience and erasure. Language diversity Language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the relationship between diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the cultural adaptation to the environment that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation are allowing dominant languages (such as English) to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important traditional ecological knowledge contained within their languages.Harrison, K. David. (2007) When Languages Die: The Extinction of the World's Languages and the Erosion of Human Knowledge. Oxford: Oxford University Press Ecolinguistic research aims to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it.Terralingua (2008) Terralingua: unity in biocultural diversity http://www.terralingua.org/Harmond, David (1996) Losing species, losing languages: connections between biological and linguistic diversity.

Darwin: University of the Northern Territory Press The United Nations Environment Program's position that: Nettle and Romaine (2000:166) write that \\"delicate tropical environments in particular must be managed with care and skill. It is indigenous peoples who have the relevant practical knowledge, since they have been successfully making a living in them for hundreds of generations. Much of this detailed knowledge about local ecosystems is encoded in indigenous language and rapidly being lost\\".Nettle, D., and Romaine, S. 2000. Vanishing voices: the extinction of the world’s languages. Oxford University Press. Mühlhaüsler states \\"the rapid decline in the world's linguistic diversity thus must be regarded with apprehension by those who perceive the interconnection between linguistic and biological diversity\\".Mühlhaüsler, Peter (2003) Language of environment, environment of language: a course in ecolinguistics. pg.60. London: Battlebridge Overall, language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the correlation between the diversity of language and biological diversity, with the knowledge of nature embedded in local cultures being the link between the two.

His entire work consists of short stories, best described as surreal fables in the tradition of Franz Kafka - this being so, Rubião's work must be seen as part of the Magic Realism movement of late 20th-century Latin America. It is said that Rubião was obsessive about his work, revising it at every new edition, always changing a few details, such as characters' names. Biography Rubião was born in Carmo de Minas city, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, to Eugênio Alvares Rubião and Maria Antonieta Ferreira Rubião. He attended school in Conceição do Rio Verde, then studied law in Belo Horizonte, graduating in 1942. In 1947 he released his first collection of short stories, O ex-mágico. The book won little acclaim and Rubião began work as a political advisor. In 1951, he became head of the governor's office of Presidente Kubitschek. Between 1956 and 1961 he served as cultural attaché of Brazil in Spain. In 1966 he founded the Literary Supplement of the Official Gazette of Minas Gerais, which became the most widely distributed literary supplement in Brazil. The publication of O pirotécnico Zacarias in 1974 brought Rubião sudden literary fame. He is believed to have influenced many Brazilian authors, among them José J. Veiga and Moacyr Scliar.

Career  The English annexed the Dutch province of New Netherland in 1664, and lands west of Long Island and Manhattan Island were awarded to two Lords Proprietors, John Berkeley and George Carteret (cousin of Philip). In 1665, Carteret (or \\"Cartaret\\") was appointed by them to take possession of the newly acquired territory which been renamed the Province of New Caesaria, or New Jersey, and assume the position of governor. Philip Carteret and Berkeley issued the Concessions and Agreements of the Proprietors of New Jersey, the \\"most liberal grant of political privileges made by any English colonial proprietor to the people\\".Morison Freedom of conscience was guaranteed and generous land grants were promised. Carteret indeed issued many grants of lands to settlers and landowners, partly with the purpose of increasing the worth of the colony. The pair \\"expected to profit from sales of their rich North American land holdings, and they were not disappointed\\".Ferrell Carteret designated Elizabethtown (named after the wife of George Carteret) as the capital of New Jersey, where a representative assembly first met in 1668. Middletown Township and Shrewsbury Township refused to send representatives to this New Jersey Assembly and declared their independence, electing James Carteret as their leader. Carteret became angry and left for England, and had the English government force the New Jersey settlers to pay quitrents. Carteret found the province inhabited by \\"a few hundred Dutchmen and English Puritans. During his governorship, more towns sprung up in New Jersey. By the end of his term in 1682 the province consisted of seven towns, and many outlying plantations. The populations (exclusive of Lenape natives) was about 3500 in the seven established towns of Berghen, Newarke, Elizabeth Towne, Woodbridge, Piscattawy and Middletown, with an undetermined number in outlying areas. After the death of George Carteret, Governor Edmund Andros of New York attempted to seize power in East Jersey. When Philip Carteret refused to give up his position as governor, Andros sent a raiding party to his home and had him beaten and arrested to New York. Carteret was placed on trial, but was acquitted by the jury. The attack caused permanent injuries to Carteret, and he died in 1682.

The spiritual founder of the college is considered to be Venerable Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan.http://www.salvatoriancollege.com/30/history- of-the-school  History  Salvatorian College was founded in 1926 by the Salvatorian Brothers. They had come to Harrow in 1901 and established a small parish dedicated to Saint Joseph. It was not until 1926 that the community was big enough to warrant the opening a school. The grammar school opened in September 1926 with thirteen boys and Fr Cuthbert Smith SDS as the first headmaster. Shortly after, a prep department for boys aged 8–11 was opened as the number of boys grew. Under the tripartite system it attained voluntary aided grammar school status in 1961. The prep department was closed that same year. With the abolition of the tripartite system and Harrow LEA adopting the three-tier system, in 1979, the sixth form was closed and consolidated into the coeducational St Dominic's Sixth Form College, formerly a convent grammar school for girls run by the Dominican Sisters while the College became a comprehensive school for boys aged 12 to 16, although the entry age later became 11 when Harrow Council reverted to the two-tier system in line with other London boroughs. The first lay headmaster/headteacher was appointed in 1981 and most teachers are lay staff but the school remains under the trusteeship of the Salvatorians, whose provincial office is located down the road from the school and provincial priest serves as Vice Chair of Governors. The College was a grant-maintained school until the scheme was abolished and it switched to become a voluntary aided school.History In 2012, the school became an academy.

It is located in Zimbabwe House, a Grade II* Listed Building at 429 Strand in central London. It was previously a High Commission and became an embassy after Zimbabwe's departure from the Commonwealth on 7 December 2003 in protest of international criticism of Robert Mugabe's regime's human rights record and its policies. History=Architecture and sculptures The building was designed by architect Charles Holden in 1907–08 as the headquarters of the British Medical Association and featured a series of sculptures by Jacob Epstein representing the development of science and the Ages of Man, his first major commission in London. The nakedness of many of these sculptures was initially shocking to Edwardian sensibilities and provoked considerable controversy at the time. The controversy soon died down and the mutilated condition of many of the sculptures has nothing to do with prudish censorship; it was caused in the 1930s when possibly dangerous projecting features were hacked off after pieces fell from one of the statues. Rhodesian High Commission As Rhodesia House it housed of the High Commission of Southern Rhodesia from 1923 until the Rhodesian UDI on 11 November 1965. Rhodesia was unique in being the only British colony to have a High Commission, as only dominions (and later, independent Commonwealth members) were represented by such legations. After the UDI, Rhodesia's High Commissioner, Brigadier Andrew Skeen was declared persona non-grata by the British Government and ordered to leave the country. However, because of concerns over diplomatic property under international law, Rhodesia House was not seized by the British Government. It simply became a Representative Office with no official diplomatic status, until the country became Zimbabwe in 1980.

History Montreal West High School Junior Hockey Team in 1941 Montreal West High School Dance Band in 1941 It originally opened as the Aberdeen School of Coteau Saint-Pierre, or Aberdeen School, in a two-story school erected in 1894 that housed two hundred students on Easton Avenue in Montreal West. The school was often used for social functions, public meetings, and council meetings until the Montreal West Town Hall was built in 1910. The name of the school was changed twice, first to Aberdeen Model School, and then to Montreal West High School in 1921. In the 1930s, there was a sharp increase in the school's population. The school was becoming too crowded and it was decided it was unsafe to house such a large number of students. It was confirmed in 1930 that the school would have to be demolished, beginning on May 7, 1931. This began on May 7, 1931. The cornerstone for a larger, more permanent building was laid on January 9, 1932, followed by the formal opening ceremony for the new school. In the early 1980s, declining student enrollment signaled the imminent closure of Montreal West High School, as well as Royal Vale High School, which shared the same building. In 1982, students, parents, teachers, and administrators put forth a proposal to the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal (PSGBM), which was precursor to the English Montreal School Board. The proposal called for an \\"alternative\\" high school offering programs similar to those of a private school. Limited enrollment, strict discipline, a dress code, fluency in English and French, computer literacy and compulsory extra-curricular activities were to be focal points for the curriculum. The School Board would fund the alternative school, but the School Committee had to raise money through donations and events (such as a raffle to equip two new computer laboratories). On January 26, 1983, the School Board accepted the proposal for the alternative school. Montreal West High School and Royal Vale High School were replaced in September 1983 by Royal West Academy. Most existing staff and students of both schools remained in the merged school. In October 2004, the Surete du Quebec began an investigation related to Renwick Spence (1928–2016), once a prominent and popular teacher at the school, who by then had retired. According to victims and former students who talked to the media, most of the alleged abuse was reported to have occurred at Spence's cabin in Morin- Heights. In September 2006, Spence pleaded guilty to charges of abusing seven schoolboys between 1967 and 1981. Although some older students were aware of the allegations at the time, former fellow teachers and administrators denied ever having heard of them.

When no agreement exists between countries, amateur radio operators are often required to apply for a reciprocal operating permit or a full amateur radio license and call sign from the host country. Some countries may accept a foreign amateur radio licenses as proof of qualification in lieu of examination requirements whereas other host countries may provide unilateral reciprocal operating privileges without the need for additional licensing.  European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations = CEPT License  Member Nations of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) all share the same amateur radio reciprocal licensing requirements. Amateurs are permitted to operate from most European countries without the requirement of obtaining additional licensees or permits. The following countries outside of Europe also participate in CEPT Recommendation T/R 61-01: * Australia * Canada * Israel * Netherlands Antilles * New Zealand * Peru * South Africa * The United States = US and Canadian citizens visiting a CEPT Country = The United States and Canada currently accept CEPT licenses within areas controlled by the US Federal Communications Commission or Industry Canada respectively. CEPT member countries accept: * US and Canadian Advanced Class Licenses; and, * US Amateur Extra Class Licenses. US General Class licenses are accepted under a separate agreement as CEPT Novice licensees. United States licensed stations are required to carry and provide upon request: * A US passport; * A copy of the 2009 FCC CEPT notice; and, * A valid FCC amateur radio license. In Canada, \\"the Minister of Industry has delegated Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) to issue CEPT permits for Canadian licensed stations.\\" Canadian licensed stations are required to provide upon request: * A Canadian passport; * A copy of the licensee's CEPT permit; and, * A valid Canadian amateur radio licence. As of February 4, 2008, CEPT no longer accepts Technician or General Class Licensees for CEPT reciprocal privileges.  CEPT Novice License In 2009 the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) revised the 'CEPT Novice Radio Amateur license', a separate agreement, to include novice class reciprocal operating privileges in some CEPT countries under modified conditions. European reciprocal privileges have, at least in part, been restored to US General Class Operators as CEPT Novice Operators.  CITEL agreement = IARP License  The International Amateur Radio Permit (IARP) allows foreign operation within North and South American treaty countries without the need to obtain a license or permit. The CITEL agreement allows an IARP to be issued, by a member-society of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU).  The United States and Canada = Domestic Licenses  Map of Canadian amateur radio prefixes/suffixes Citizens of the United States or Canada may operate in the other country as a domestically licensed station, as if their license had been issued in said country, without the requirement of obtaining any license or permission from the other government. An American or Canadian amateur may allow third party use of his station and call sign, carry international third party traffic, serve as a temporary control operator for a repeater station, and identify themselves as a domestic station using the national call sign system, provided:http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01701.html > # The Licensee has citizenship and a valid amateur radio license from the country for their residency; # The Licensee appends the local US/Canadian Zone (Region) to the END of their call sign when identifying their station; and, # The Licensee adheres to the operating powers, frequency (band) allocations, and laws pertaining to the country they are currently operating in.

International Waters and Air Space  Amateur radio operators in international waters or airspace are subject to the reciprocal licensing requirements pertaining to the country under which the vessel is flagged. Permission by the vessel's captain for on-board use of amateur radio equipment is often a legal requirement.  Antarctica  Although Antarctica is considered international by treaty, Amateur radio operators in Antarctica are often subject to the reciprocal licensing requirements pertaining to the country under which the camp is flagged.  Extraterrestrial  Stations operating from space, defined as an altitude above 50 km above the height of the average terrain, are subject to the terms and conditions established in conjunction with their amateur license grant. DX-pedition A DXer operates during a holiday DXpedition to Muscat, Oman. A DX-pedition is an expedition to what is considered an exotic place by amateur radio operators, perhaps because of its remoteness or because there are very few radio amateurs active from that place. This could be an island, a country, or even a particular spot on a geographical grid. The activity was pioneered by one-time ARRL president Robert W. Denniston. Mr. Denniston's 1948 DX-pedition was to the Bahamas and was called \\"Gon-Waki\\" ala Thor Heyerdahl's \\"Kon-Tiki\\" expedition the previous year. Arguably there were earlier trips where amateur radio was used that might have qualified as DX-peditions. An example is the voyage of the schooner Kaimiloa, which traveled the South Pacific in 1924. While the ship's wealthy owners enjoyed the islands an amateur radio operator kept contact with, and sent QSL cards to, experimenters in the United States.

Formed in 2003, they were signed to Tooth & Nail Records and Immortal Records. In all the group released two EPs and two full-length albums before their disestablishment in 2007. Their final lineup consisted of singer/keyboardist Jonathan Jones, guitarist Ryan Lallier, bassist Nate Harold and drummer Tim Very. History Waking Ashland was formed in November 2003 by singer/keyboardist Jonathan Jones, guitarist Ryan Lallier, Clayton Boek, and drummer Thomas Lee. Robert Teegarden -- a friend of the band -- temporarily helped out to fill the vacant position on the bass guitar. The band name stems from the aspect of connecting people through music, paired with a reference to the town of Ashland, Oregon. Influenced by as diverse acts as Joe Jackson, Coldplay, The Pixies and Hüsker Dü, Waking Ashland combined emotional piano melodies with sonic distortion guitars, creating a unique sound among their genre. In early 2004, they self-recorded and released their debut EP I Am for You. Simultaneously, the line-up was completed by guitarist Nick Rucker and bassist Derek Vaughn, replacing Teegarden. However, the two soon left the band, and a permanent bassist was found in Andrew Grosse, frontman Jones' former bandmate in their Christian accented high school band Formula316. Without record label distribution and solely through word of mouth promotion, the CD's first pressing of 1,000 copies (being only available through the band's website and at their concerts) sold out within a month. To date, the six-song CD managed to sell over 10,000 copies. Its success landed the band a booking agent and allowed them to drop out of college, to pursue a career in the music industry. As the result of their constant touring and -- due to lucky circumstances -- their participating in 2004's Warped Tour, word spread fast and garnered the attention of several record labels, including Tooth & Nail Records, home to such bands as Further Seems Forever, Mae and Underoath. Tooth & Nail signed Waking Ashland and released their first full-length album Composure -- produced by Lou Giordano -- in May 2005. The album scanned 2,400 units within its first week of sales, debuting at No. 19 on Nielsen SoundScan's Alternative New Artist chart and at No. 53 on their Top New Artist Album chart. The album also hit No. 29 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart.[ Billboard], Allmusic.com On September 5, 2005, a statement on the band's website announced that Grosse and Lee had left the band due to in-band conflicts. Temporary touring members included drummers Joe Greenetz from Sherwood and Rob Lynch from Harris, as well as bassists Jon Sullivan from Jack's Mannequin and Trevor Sellers from Number One Gun. On February 8, 2006, Waking Ashland released a nine-song EP, titled Telescopes, only in Japan. Immortal Records released Telescopes in the United States on June 13, 2006. The Japanese release had two bonus tracks, which were acoustic versions of \\"October Skies\\" and \\"I Am For You\\" from Composure. While the release featured session musicians to back up Jones and Lallier, a permanent rhythm section was finally announced in a blog on the band's MySpace profile as Nate Harold and Tim Very. Part of the band's success can be attributed to their pages on MySpace and PureVolume. , Waking Ashland's songs have been played over 1.3 million times on MySpace and over 1.2 million times on PureVolume.

Background The mandatory publication of graduation rates came into effect in 1990 as a consequence of the \\"Student Right-to-Know Act,\\" which attempted to create an environment in which universities would become more devoted to academics and hold athletes more accountable for academic success. However, the graduation rates established by the NCAA showed poor results, for example they reported that among students who entered college between 1993 and 1996 only 51 percent of football players graduated within 6 years and 41 percent of basketball players. Feeling pressure to improve these poor rates the NCAA instituted reforms in 2004, including the APR, a new method for gauging the academic progress of student athletes. It was put into place in order to aid in the NCAA's goal for student-athletes to graduate with meaningful degrees preparing them for life. The principal data collector was Thomas Paskus, the principal research scientist for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Originally, if a program's four-year average APR fell below 925, that would trigger sanctions like scholarship losses, and a four-year APR of 900 or lower triggered \\"historical penalties\\" like postseason bans. In 2011, the NCAA voted to raise the maximum APR that triggers penalties to 930. Functions The APR measures how scholarship student-athletes are performing term by term throughout the school year. It is a composite team measurement based upon how individual team members do academically. Teams that don't make the 930 APR threshold are subject to sanctions. The NCAA works closely with the schools that do not meet the threshold in order to improve them. When a school has APR challenges, it may be encouraged or even required to present an academic improvement plan to the NCAA. In reviewing these plans, the national office staff encourages schools to work with other campus units to achieve a positive outcome. The staff also works with APR-challenged schools to create reasonable timelines for improvement. While eligibility requirements make the individual student-athlete accountable, the Academic Progress Rate creates a level of responsibility for the university. Measurement Teams that fail to achieve an APR score of 930 - equivalent to a 50% graduation rate - may be penalized. A perfect score is 1000. The scores are calculated as follows: > Each student-athlete receiving athletically related financial aid earns one > retention point for staying in school and one eligibility point for being > academically eligible. A team’s total points are divided by the points > possible and then multiplied by one thousand to equal the team’s Academic > Progress Rate score. Example: A Division I Football Bowl Subdivision team > awards the full complement of 85 grants-in-aid. If 80 student-athletes > remain in school and academically eligible, three remain in school but are > academically ineligible and two drop out academically ineligible, the team > earns 163 of 170 possible points for that term. Divide 163 by 170 and > multiply by 1,000 to determine that the team’s Academic Progress Rate for > that term is 959. The NCAA calculates the rate as a rolling, four-year figure that takes into account all the points student-athletes could earn for remaining in school and academically eligible during that period. Teams that do not earn an Academic Progress Rate above specific benchmarks face penalties ranging from scholarship reductions to more severe sanctions like restrictions on scholarships and practice time. Sanctions Teams that score below 930 and have a student-athlete who both failed academically and left school can lose scholarships (up to 10 percent of their scholarships each year) under the immediate penalty structure. Teams with Academic Progress Rates below 900 face additional sanctions, increasing in severity for each consecutive year the team fails to meet the standard. Year 1: a public warning letter for poor performance Year 2: restrictions on scholarships and practice time Year 3: loss of postseason competition for the team (such as a bowl game or the men's basketball tournament) Year 4: restricted membership status for an institution. The school's entire athletics program is penalized and will not be considered a part of Division I. The first penalties under the APR system were scheduled to be announced in December 2005. Starting with the 2008–09 academic year, bans from postseason competition were added to the penalty structure. The most severe penalty available is a one-year suspension of NCAA membership, which has not yet been assessed as of 2010–11. Prior to 2010–11, only four teams had received postseason bans. The results of the NCAA's APR report for that year, which covered 2006–07 through 2009–10, saw eight teams receive that penalty—five in men's basketball and three in football. Most notably, Southern University became the first school ever to receive APR- related postseason bans in two sports. The highest-profile penalty in that year's cycle was handed down to defending NCAA men's basketball champion Connecticut. The Huskies lost two scholarships for the 2011–12 season due to APR violations. UConn was barred from postseason play in 2012–13 due to APR penalties. For the 2014 football season, Idaho and UNLV received postseason bans due to low four-year APR averages. However, UNLV submitted \\"updated\\" APR score to the NCAA raising the score needed for postseason eligibility. Reform NCAA college presidents met in Indianapolis in August 2011 to discuss a reform on the APR because of the poor academic performance by student athletes. The NCAA Board of Directors, on Thursday August 11, voted to ban Division I athletic teams from postseason play if their four-year academic progress rate failed to meet 930. The new policy took effect in the 2012-13 academic year; however institutions will have a period of 3 years to align their APR with the new standard. The postseason restrictions for the next few years are as follows: 2012-13 postseason: 900 four-year average or 930 average over most recent two years 2013-14 postseason: 930 four-year average or 940 average over most recent two years 2015-16 postseason and beyond: 930 four- year average Currently, the APR benchmark for postseason play is 900 so this is a significant increase and could result in serious consequences for some institutions that fail to improve their APR.  Reform effects On football= There are many questions regarding how the NCAA will enforce the new policy for football. The Bowl Championship Series is its own entity and decides the college football postseason, thus making them the governing body for college football. President Gary Ransdell said there is uncertainty on how the new standard relates to the BCS. \\"The BCS is an independently run enterprise, yet it involves NCAA member institutions,\\" he said. \\"So does this 930 rule also determine eligibility for BCS games? I think that's yet to be ironed out.\\" Some NCAA institutions participate in football leagues, other than the BCS, which are organized by the NCAA and these reforms would apply to. In the 2011-12 academic year there were 17 teams in the FBS league with APRs below 930 and 37 teams in the FCS league. If these programs do not find a way to improve their APR then they will suffer postseason bans. Under the new College Playoff system, tiebreaker procedures based on a school's Academic Progress Rate (APR) allow for the possibility of 5-7 teams to play in bowl games if not enough teams qualify to fill all 80 spots with at least a 6-6 record. = On men's basketball= The APR's flaws are highlighted in men's basketball. \\"Syracuse's Jim Boeheim suffered the two-scholarship hit last summer, and in doing so publicly upbraided the APR for taking into account the departures of Eric Devendorf, Jonny Flynn and Paul Harris for the NBA draft, all three of whom left campus to prepare for the NBA event without fulfilling their spring semester requirements.\\" Many college basketball players leave before they graduate, and the ones that leave in bad academic standing cause the APR to go down. This issue is seen throughout college basketball. To exemplify this phenomenon for collegiate basketball, if the 930 postseason ban had been in effect for the 2011-12 season then 99 teams would have received postseason bans. Adjustments The NCAA does adjust APR, on a student-by- student basis, in two circumstances. One exception that can be made, is for student-athletes who leave prior to graduation, while in good academic standing, to pursue a professional career. Another is for student-athletes who transfer to another school while meeting minimum academic requirements and student-athletes who return to graduate at a later date. Compiling college athletes’ graduation rates stemmed partly from press coverage that 76 to 92 percent of professional athletes lacked college degrees and from revelations that some were functionally illiterate.Southall, R. M. (2012). \\"Taking the measure of graduation rates in big-time college sports.\\" Phi Kappa Phi Forum, 92(3), 18-20. In the 2010–11 cycle, the NCAA granted nearly 700 APR adjustments in the latter category, out of a total of over 6,400 Division I teams. (The APR is calculated based only on scholarship players already, not walk-ons) Numerous other sources, from sports conferences to schools themselves, document much lower graduation rates for college football and men's basketball and baseball players than for general students. Compounding matters is that only about 57 percent of all college students complete a bachelor's degree in six years. Graduation Success Rate As part of this strategy, the NCAA strives “to ensure the academic commitment of student- athletes and to increase the likelihood that they will earn degrees.”17 Along these lines, in 2005 the NCAA formulated a tool called the Graduation Success Rate (GSR) for Division I schools.18 GSR basically removes athletes who leave an institution in good academic standing from the denominator and adds those who transfer in and eventually graduate to the sample. Thus, GSR recognizes that college athletes (based at least partly on their interests and abilities) may take a different path to graduation than other full-time students and in some aspects is an accurate yardstick. The latest single-year GSR for all NCAA Division I athletes (who began college in 2004) was 82 percent. GSR for Division I FBS football was 67 percent, for men's basketball 66 percent, for women's basketball 84 percent, and for baseball 72 percent. APR compared to Graduation Standards=Federal Graduation Rate Another indicator of the academic performance of student athletes is the Federal Graduation Rate, FGR, which is published by the university. In computing the FGR the only data that is relevant is whether the student athlete graduates within six years of enrolling in the institution. This differs from the APR because it makes no distinction of the purpose a student has for leaving and whether or not they leave a university in good academic standing. If a student leaves their enrolled university to pursue a professional athletic career this counts the same under the FGR as someone who leaves because they failed out of school; on the other hand, by the APR standards a student that leaves while still in good academic standing receives one point out of two which distinguishes them from someone that left because of academic failure. With that in mind, FGR rates usually reflect a value lower than the APR at elite athletic institutions that consistently send athletes to the professional leagues prior to graduation. Graduation Success Rate The NCAA developed its Graduation Success Rate, GSR, in response to criticism that the FGR understates the academic success of athletes because the FGR method does not take into account two important factors in college athletics: 1\\\\. When student-athletes transfer from an institution before graduating and are in good academic standing (perhaps to transfer from an institution for more playing time or a different major). 2\\\\. Those student-athletes who transfer to an institution (e.g. from a community college or another 4-year college) and earn a degree. The FGR treats transfers as nongraduates for the original institution the student-athlete attended, even if that student-athlete later graduates from another institution. Also, the FGR does not include that student-athlete in the graduation rates at the new institution where he/she does graduate. Therefore, once a student-athlete transfers to another school he/she is no longer recognized in the calculated graduation rate. The GSR takes into account both factors and gives credit to institutions for successful transfers, whether they are leaving or entering an institution. Potential misinterpretations While the numbers represented in the APR have a certain significance, there can be misrepresentations for people unfamiliar with what the APR is showing. For example, the APR only applies to students that receive athletic financial aid, which is by no means all varsity athletes at a university. NCAA's 1,265 member colleges and universities report that they have more than 355,000 student-athletes playing each year. Approximately 36% of these NCAA student-athletes receive a share of the $1 billion earmarked for athletic scholarships. Another common misuse of the data occurs when APR results are compared between universities. This is usually not a valid comparison unless it is viewed alongside the graduation rates for non athletes at the institution. For example, one institution may have an APR representing that only 50% of athletes are on track to graduate which seems like athletes are under performing at the university. However, if the graduation rate for non-athletes is also 50% then the low graduation rate for the athletes is not a student-athlete problem, but a university wide problem. Furthermore, it is not always relevant to compare APR scores across universities because the academic rigors between universities differ. For example, at some high performing academic universities freshman struggle with eligibility because the workload is hard to deal with initially, but in the end, those students find academic success.

Pakol (Khowar: پکول‎ ; ; Balti بروقپی نتینگ; ; Shina/Khowar language: Pakhui; Wakhi Seeked/Brushashki: Phartsun), Popularly known as the Chitrali cap, is a soft round-topped men's hat, typically of wool and found in any of a variety of earthy colors: brown, black, grey, ivory or dyed red using walnut. Pakol is a Khowar Chitrali word and is derived from the word Khoi which means hat in Khowar. The original Khowar name for the hat is Khapol. The cap's origin are debated upon with a theory of a possible origin in southeastern Europe, however the consensus among historians and ethnographers is for it to have originated from Chitral. The woolen cap has been the staple headgear of the Chitrali people for centuries. The main source of production is Chitral in Pakistan which is also located at the center of its range. It is also now spread and worn in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pashtun regions of Pakistan and also by Afghans such as Tajiks and Nuristani people as well as Afghan Pashtuns. Nuristan is a major region where it is imported from Chitral.  Overview  The pakol gained popularity in Nuristan in Afghanistan after the campaign of Emir Abdul Rehman. It was worn in Chitral. It gradually spread to Swat and Dir in Pakistan and is a considered a staple of their ethnic background. In the past couple of decades, the pakol has also been worn in India, especially in parts of Delhi and Kashmir. Origins and History a boy statue from Macedonia (circa 300bc) wearing left  Kausia and Alexander  The pakol is remarkably similar to the ancient Macedonian kausia hat, worn by men in ancient Southeast Europe, which may have been its ancestor. According to Bonnie Kingsley the kausia may have came to the Mediterranean as a campaign hat worn by Alexander and veterans of his campaigns in India. but according to Ernst Fredricksmeyer the kausia was too established a staple of the Macedonian wardrobe for it to have been imported from Asia to Macedonia.  Criticism of Macedonian Link  However Willem Vogelsang of the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, showed that the pakool is actually a simple adaptation of caps with rolled rims worn all over the borderlands of China, India and Central Asia. At the juncture of the 3 regions lies Chitral forming a watershed. Chitralis from Upper Chitral pictured wearing the Pakol in 1906  Origin, Discovery and Documentation in Chitral  The modern Pakol is believed to have originated from Chitral where it was made and found exclusively until the end of the 19th century. The word Pakol is a chitrali word derived from another chitrali name of the hat Khapol. The Pakol is made from a special type of wool known as the Chitrali patti which is procured from the sheepherders from its valleys. The earliest mention of the Pakol is attributed to Donatus O'Briens' book (1895) on the language of Chitral, where describing the ethnic dress of Chitralis he states that: \\"The dress worn by most men consist of a homespun cap black, brown or grey made in the shape of a bag and rolled up until it fits the skull.\\" Later on in 1896 George Scott Robertson denoted the cap with the name \\"Chitrali Cap\\".alt=Early mentions of its nativity and homogeneity to Chitral and its English and local nomenclature paired with documentation of it not being worn in any of the regions surrounding Chitral make it evident that the Pakol most probably originated from the Chitral region of Northern Pakistan where it was worn exclusively till the end of the 19th century.  The Kafiristan Campaign and Adoption by Nuristanis  Pakistani street vendors operating a pakol shop in Gilgit- Baltistan; the cap is slightly different than Chitrali caps. The earliest documentations of the inhabitants of Kafiristan states that they went about without any headgear. Another source refers to the pakol as the chitrali cap and states that it is only worn in the Bashgul valley as an imported article of clothing because of Bashgul's proximity to Chitral. Pakols must have spread at a quick pace among the locals, now renamed Nuristanis, after and partially as a consequence of the conquest of Kafiristan by Abdul Rahman Khan of Afghanistan. The opening up of the valleys to increased contact and trade, and the population's conversion to Islam, might have provided incentives for the residents to abandon their previously distinctive hairstyle and cover their heads with hats. It seems logical that the men adopted one with which they were already acquainted, and that was readily available locally. The adoption of specific items of clothing to mark a new identity, especially a religious one, is well-established in history.  Initial Prominence in Pakistan  The Pakol first found for itself prominence in Pakistan by Chitrali traders and businessmen who expanded their businesses. The Pakol was started to be worn in many parts of Pakistan especially the adjoining areas to Chitral such as Dir, Swat, Malakand and Bajaur.  Initial Prominence in Afghanistan  In the 1980s, the pakol was worn by a special unit of the Afghan Mujahideen who fought against the Soviets. The pakol owes its global celebrity to the Tajik-majority members of the Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan, who, following their leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, first adopted it as a standard item of their outfit. Since then the headware has become famous in Afghanistan.

She was elected president of the Jacksonville branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, president of the Jacksonville Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta and elected to the 15th District of the Florida House of Representatives for two terms.  Early life  Dennis was born in Jacksonville, Florida to Eli Clayton and Claudia. She was the youngest of five children. She graduated from Stanton High School in 1943, and received a B.A. from Clark College in 1953 with a major in psychology. She received her master's degree in Library Science in 1957. On February 7, 1954, she married Leo Dennis. They remained married until November 2, 2010 when he died at the age of 92. Three children were born of this marriage: Wilene, Leo and Byron. Career and activism=Librarian Dennis was hired as an assistant librarian at the Wilder Park Branch Library, the only library where blacks were allowed during that time, earning 50 cents an hour. When she went to City Hall to apply for a librarian position, she was told that they didn't have any openings for niggers. She answered,\\"Good, I'm not one.\\" She eventually took the Civil Service Test, and was hired by the City of Jacksonville as a librarian. In 1969, she was named Chief of Children Services for the Jacksonville Library System, the first black person to hold this position. She wrote a grant that was approved to Housing and Urban Development for an outreach program entitled \\"LOOP\\" which is an acronym for Library Operated Outreach Program. LOOP was recognized by the American Library Association as a model program. She retired in 1980.  Family Cooperative Learning and Development  In 1978, she founded Fam-Co Learning and Development Center, a non-profit child daycare center. In 1992, Child Magazine listed the child care center as one of the top ten in the country. In 1999, she pleaded guilty to appropriating government subsidies intended for the daycare, and was forced to resign from the state legislature.

The local branch filed a suit against the Duval County School Board in 1985 alleging that the School Board had not completely desegregated the schools. After discovering thousands of vacant seats in schools located in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, the NAACP urged the community to vote no on a school bond issue to build new schools in the predominantly white community. Between December 14 and December 18, 1989, four bombs were mailed to persons involved in civil rights and desegregation cases. Two persons were killed when they opened packages mailed to them. On December 18, 1989, Ms. Dennis was one of four persons who received a pipe bomb addressed to the local branch of the NAACP. A series of incidents prevented Ms. Dennis from opening the package mailed to her at the local office of the NAACP. She told a reporter \\"for the rest of her life, she will believe it was a miracle, an act of divine intervention, that kept her from opening the package addressed to her. The NAACP and the Duval County School Board reached an agreement after thirty years in court after many failed attempts. The agreement was televised to the Jacksonville community on Tuesday night, June 5, 1990. In 1990, Ms. Dennis' name, along with six other African American leaders appeared on a flyer that read: \\"WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE, $10,000 REWARD.\\" In a Florida Times Union article in 1991, Fourth Judicial Chief Circuit John Santora Jr. expressed his personal views regarding blacks, referred to a black woman judicial assistant as a \\"girl\\", his opposition to interracial marriage, how integration is the cause of crime and violence among black youth.

Tatars became subjects of Russia after the Siege of Kazan in 1552. Since Russians associated Tatars with the Mongol Golden Horde (which ruled Russia in the 13th century), they began to negatively stereotype the Tatar people. Such negative stereotypes have persisted into modern Russian society. Some Tatar intellectuals have tried to link Tatar heritage with the historic Bulgar population of today's Tatarstan. Russians were using the Tatar ethnonym during the 18th and 19th centuries to denote all Turkic inhabitants of the Russian Empire, but, before the emergence of the Soviet Union, the Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire did not generally identify as Tatars. Up to the end of the 19th century, Volga Tatars mainly identified as Muslims, until the rehabilitation of the ethnonym Tatar occurred. Russian officials used literary Tatar language to interact with the Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire before the end of the 19th century. The Volga Tatar role in the Muslim national and cultural movements of the Russian Empire before the 1917 Revolution is significant and this continued even after 1917. Tatar authorities have attempted since the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, to reverse the Russification of Tatarstan that took place during the Soviet period. Volga Tatar subgroups=Kazan Tatars Volga Tatar operatic soprano Aida Garifullina The majority of Volga Tatars are Kazan Tatars. They form the bulk of the Tatar population of Tatarstan. Traditionally, they inhabit the left bank of Volga river.Татары (Серия «Народы и культуры» РАН). М.: Наука, 2001. — P.36. Khazar invasions forced the Bulgars, Turkic people, to migrate from the Azov steppes to the Middle Volga and lower Kama region during the first half of the eighth century. In the period of 10th–13th centuries, Turkic peoples, including Kipchaks, migrated from southern Siberia to Europe. They played a significant role in the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the 13th century. Tatar ethnogenesis took place after Turkic peoples, who were mixed with the Bulgars and other local inhabitants of the Volga River area, kept Kipchak dialect and became Muslims. Several new Tatar states had emerged by the 1500s after the Golden Horde fell. These states were Khanate of Kazan, Astrakhan Khanate, Khanate of Sibir and Crimean Khanate. Controversy surrounds the origin of the Tatar people, whether they are descended either from Bulgars or Golden Horde. According to one theory, Kazan Tatar heritage can be traced back to Kipchaks of the Golden Horde, yet according to another theory, the Tatars emerged from the Bulgar culture that survived the Mongol conquest of 1236–1237. Mishars Mishars (or Mişär- Tatars) are an ethnographic group of Volga Tatars speaking Mishar dialect of the Tatar language. They comprise approximately one third of the Volga Tatar population. They are descendants of Cuman-Kipchak tribes who mixed with the Burtas in the Middle Oka River area and Meschiora. Nowadays, they live in Chelyabinsk, Ulyanovsk, Penza, Ryazan, Nizhegorodskaya oblasts of Russia and in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Mordovia. Qasím Tatars The Qasím Tatars have their capital in the town of Qasím (Kasimov in Russian transcription) in Ryazan Oblast. See \\"Qasim Khanate\\" for their history. Today, there are 1,100 Qasím Tatars living in Kasimov. There is no reliable information about their number elsewhere. Noqrat Tatars Noqrat Tatars live in Russia's Republic of Udmurtia and Kirov Oblast. In 1920s their number was around 15,000 people. Perm (Ostyak) Tatars Ethnographic subgroup of Kazan Tatars that lives in Russia's Perm Krai. Some Tatar scholars (as Zakiev) name them Ostyak Tatars. Their number is (2002) c.130,000 people. Keräşens A policy of Christianization of the Muslim Tatars was enacted by the Russian authorities, beginning in 1552, resulting in the emergence of Keräşens (Christianized Tatars). Many Volga Tatars were forcibly Christianized by Ivan the Terrible during the 16th century, and continued to face forced baptisms and conversions under subsequent Russian rulers and Orthodox clergy up to the 60s of the 18th century. Some public figures suppose that the Suars were ancestors of the Keräşen Tatars, and had been converted to Christianity by Armenians in the 6th century while they lived in the Caucasus. Suars, like other tribes which later converted to Islam, became Volga Bulgars, and later the modern Chuvash (who are Orthodox Christians) and Kazan Tatars (who are Muslims). Keräşen Tatars live in much of the Volga-Ural area. Today, they tend to be assimilated among the Chuvash, Russians and Tatars. Eighty years of Atheistic Soviet rule made Tatars of both faiths not as religious as they once were. Russian names are largely the only remaining difference between Tatars and Keräşen Tatars. Some Cuman tribes in the Golden Horde were converted to Christianity in the 13th and 14th centuries (Nestorianism). Some prayers, written during that time in the Codex Cumanicus, sound like modern Keräşen prayers, but the connection between Christian Cumans and modern Keräşens is unknown. 1921–22 famine in Tatarstan The 1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan was a period of mass starvation and drought that took place in the Tatar ASSR as a result of war communism policy, in which 500,000 to 2,000,000 peasants died. The event was part of the greater Russian famine of 1921–22 that affected other parts of the USSR, in which up 5,000,000 people died in total. Traditional culture=Festivals Sabantuy in Tatarstan Historically, the traditional celebrations of Tatars depended largely on the agricultural cycle.

Traditional Tatar beverages include ayran, katyk and kumys. Population figures In the 1910s, they numbered about half a million in the area of Kazan. Nearly 2 million Volga Tatars died in the 1921–22 famine in Tatarstan. Some 15,000 belonging to the same stem had either migrated to Ryazan in the center of Russia (what is now European Russia) or had been settled as prisoners during the 16th and 17th centuries in Lithuania (Vilnius, Grodno, and Podolia). Some 2,000 resided in St. Petersburg. Volga-Ural Tatars number nearly 7 million, mostly in Russia and the republics of the former Soviet Union. While the bulk of the population is found in Tatarstan (around 2 million) and neighbouring regions, significant number of Volga-Ural Tatars live in Siberia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Outside of Tatarstan, urban Tatars usually speak Russian as their first language (in cities such as Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ufa, and cities of the Ural and Siberia).

Between 1939 and her death in 1948, Wise reported seeing regular visions of Jesus Christ and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux in her Canton home. Wise has been associated with a number of sudden and unexplained healings, including the healing of Mother Angelica, the founder of the Catholic television network EWTN, from a painful stomach ailment. In 2016, Bishop George V. Murry of the Diocese of Youngstown declared Wise a Servant of God as a first step towards her possible canonization as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. Life Rhoda Wise was born Rhoda Greer on February 22, 1888, in Cadiz, Ohio to bricklayer Eli Greer and his wife Anna, the sixth of their eight children. When she was two years old, the Greer family moved to Wheeling, West Virginia, where she was raised as a Protestant. In 1915, she married Ernest Wissmar and moved with him to Canton, Ohio, where Wissmar suddenly died of a cerebral hemorrhage six months later. She then married George Wise in 1917, and the couple continued to live in the Canton area and adopted two daughters, one of whom died in infancy. George Wise was an alcoholic and changed jobs frequently, resulting in financial hardship and embarrassment for the family. The Wise family lived at seven different addresses; by the early 1930s, they were occupying a three- room \\"depression shack\\" house near the Canton city dump. Beginning in the early 1930s, Rhoda Wise developed serious health problems, including a 39-pound ovarian cyst that had to be surgically removed, and a broken foot which failed to heal properly and caused her to suffer pain and difficulty in walking. She was hospitalized frequently and underwent a number of operations for abdominal and foot problems. In late 1933 she was briefly committed to the state mental hospital by her husband, where she was diagnosed with post- operative psychosis stemming from her surgeries. She spent two separate periods of fourteen days in the mental hospital before being discharged when her condition improved. During a 1936 stay at a Canton hospital operated by the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine, Wise befriended some of the sisters, who taught her to pray the Rosary and told her about Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Wise began to pray regularly to Saint Therese, and also became devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In December 1938, Wise decided to convert to Catholicism, and was received into the Catholic Church in January 1939.Sigler, pp. 21-37. In May 1939, Wise was diagnosed with incurable stomach cancer, discharged from the hospital and sent home to die. According to Wise, she experienced an apparition of Jesus Christ on May 28, 1939, at her home, during which Jesus told her that he would come again with Saint Therese the following month on June 28. Wise reported that Jesus and Saint Therese both appeared on June 28, and during their visit, cured Wise of her stomach cancer, including healing a large open wound on her abdomen caused by her multiple surgeries, from which her bowel had been protruding. Wise further reported that in August 1939, Saint Therese miraculously healed her injured foot, causing the heavy cast then on it to split and fall off in the process.Sigler, pp. 38-59. From 1939 to 1948, Wise said that she experienced regular apparitions of Jesus and Saint Therese, including a visit by Saint Therese on January 2, the saint's birthday, every year. Wise's reported visions totaled 28 at the time of her death in 1948. Wise was inspired by these visions to offer herself as a victim soul to save the souls of others, particularly priests and members of religious orders. On Good Friday, April 3, 1942, bleeding stigmata appeared on Wise's forehead and continued to appear and bleed at intervals over the next two years. In 1943, bleeding stigmata appeared on her hands and feet as well as her forehead. The bleeding stigmata were witnessed by many visitors to the Wise home. In her final apparition of Jesus, on June 28, 1948, Wise said that Jesus asked her to say the Rosary daily for the Conversion of Russia.Sigler, pp. 60-146. The stories of Wise's experiences spread, causing hundreds of people to write to Wise and visit her home seeking physical healing and other spiritual help.Sigler, p. 74, 147 Large crowds also gathered outside the Wise home on nights when Wise said that she was expecting an apparition.Sigler, p. 181 (photograph). Many people credited Wise with miraculous cures after they had visited her home or received holy water from her home, and she developed a reputation as a \\"miracle woman\\". In 1943, Rita Rizzo, a Canton teenager who later became known as Mother Angelica, was taken to see Wise by her mother, seeking a cure for Rizzo's painful chronic stomach ailment. Mother Angelica later recounted how Wise led the doubting and ailing Rizzo in a novena to Saint Therese. At the end of nine days of prayer, Rizzo's stomach condition suddenly disappeared. She eventually became a nun under Wise's mentorship. After suffering a stroke in early July 1948, Wise died of hypertension on July 7, 1948, in her Canton home.Sigler, p. 148-149. During the two days prior to her funeral, over 14,000 people reportedly visited her bier. Religious pilgrims, many from outside Ohio, continued to visit the Wise home even after her death and credit her with miraculous cures. Possible canonization In November 2012, the Diocese of Youngstown began to conduct an informal investigation into the life and writings of Rhoda Wise to determine if she might be a candidate for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.Sigler, p. 199. Following this investigation, in 2016, Bishop George V. Murry of the Diocese of Youngstown declared Wise a Servant of God, the first step on the path to sainthood. A formal Diocesan inquiry was launched to determine whether she may be beatified and ultimately canonized as a saint.Sigler, p. 203 (photograph of bishop's Edict for the opening of Rhoda Wise's beatification cause). In July 2018, the results of the Diocesan investigation were submitted to the Vatican. In late November of 2018, Bishop Murry along with Vicar General Msgr. Robert Siffrin, Judicial Vicar Msgr. Peter Polando, and Postulator for the Cause (and former Judicial Vicar) Msgr. Michael Cariglio, Jr., went to Rome to meet with the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and to go through the documents that were submitted in July of that year, eventually submitting the findings and results to the Holy Father, Pope Francis, in the hopes that she will soon be declared Venerable. Legacy The Grotto of the Sacred Heart and Little Flower at the Rhoda Wise Shrine, August 2017After Wise's death, her adult daughter Anna Mae Wise continued to welcome pilgrims to the Wise family home in Canton, keeping it open to the public for 47 years. When Anna Mae died in 1995, she willed the home to Mother Angelica and EWTN, who kept the house open to visitors. In 2001 the house was renovated and several structural problems repaired, but the bedroom which was the site of the claimed apparitions was left intact. A separate prayer chapel, the Grotto of the Sacred Heart and Little Flower, was erected in 2003 next to the house.Sigler, p. 152-155, 196-197. The Rhoda Wise Shrine, including the house, grounds and prayer chapel, is now a private association of the faithful that has been approved for visitors' devotions by Bishop Murry of the Diocese of Youngstown.Sigler, p. 201 (photograph of Bishop's decree document). A biography of Wise, Her Name Means Rose: The Rhoda Wise Story by Karen Sigler O.F.S., was published by EWTN in 2000.

When Alexander I abdicated in 1442, Vakhtang succeeded him to the throne of Georgia, leaving his brothers – Demetrius and George as co- kings.

Skarpnäcksfältet was built in the 1980s, and has 8,734 inhabitants as of December 31, 2009.  History  Archaeological findings, such as a hill fort and stone circles near Flatensjön, indicate that Skarpnäcksfältet and nearby areas were populated by vikings as early as the 10th century.  Skarpa by  Skarpa, a cottage of the Årsta property, was first mentioned in the will of Duke Valdemar in 1318, where it was listed as one of his donations to Uppsala domkyrka. Skarpa derives from the word skarp (), and is believed to have indicated the soil quality, which was heavy loam. It is believed that the small village of Skarpa by, with the Skarpa cottage, also consisted of three homesteads dating as far back as the 13th century. The main building of Skarpnäcks gård, as constructed in the 1860s. According to a document from 1432, Skarpa was sold by the Archdiocese of Uppsala to Hans Kröpelin, the chieftain of Eric of Pomerania, who was the King of Sweden at the time. Like in the will of Duke Valdemar, Skarpa was part of the Årsta property. During the 17th century, the land and cottages of Skarpa by were included in the Tyresö property. Tyresö was owned by the Oxenstierna family, which constructed a mansion in Skarpa by. A countess of the family (Maria Sofia de la Gardie) made Skarpa a manor () which she named Skarpnäck. The manor continued to grow in the 18th century, now housing workers and farmers. The manor switched owners a few times, and in the beginning of the 19th century, there were almost 30 buildings in Skarpnäcks gård. The last owner, Friedrich Neumüller, constructed the main building which still exists today, roughly 150 years later. Eventually, in 1922, the property was sold to the Stockholm Municipality.  Skarpnäck Airfield  Sailplane at Skarpnäck in 1972. The Skarpnäck Airfield was constructed on Skarpnäcksfältet around 1940. Originally intended to be a reserve airfield for the military, those plans were soon abandoned, and in 1943, Stockholms Segelflygklubb () moved its operations to the airfield. The airfield was commonly used for other activities, including balloon flying, races such as the 1948 Stockholm Grand Prix, baseball and greyhound racing. The airfield became a centre for alternative society movements. In August 1950, the International Union of Socialist Youth, together with the Swedish Social Democratic Youth Association, organized a week-long international tent camp, in which Tage Erlander (prime minister of Sweden), participated. During the United Nations environmental conference in 1972, which took place in Stockholm, thousands of hippies, environmental activists and leftist activists gathered in a large tent camp at Skarpnäck Airfield, organized mostly by the Hog Farm and other Woodstock veterans. This also became a large musical event, with progressive artists like Peps Persson, Kebnekajse, Blå Tåget and Träd, Gräs & Stenar playing. With the initiative of Motorförarnas Helnykterhetsförbund, a temperance organization, Sweden's first drive-in church service was held at Skarpnäck Airfield on May 30, 1957. Bishop Odd Hagen of the Methodist church spoke in front of 1,000 cars, and altogether around 6,000 people. The altar was placed on a lorry platform. In September 1980, the Stockholm Municipality decided that a large residential area called Skarpnäcksstaden () would be constructed on the airfield. The baseball and greyhound-racing facilities remained and were included in the new residential area, but the greyhound- racing was closed in 2006 in favour of a football field of artificial turf.  Geography  Skarpnäck metro station. Skarpnäcksfältet is a subdistrict of Skarpnäcks gård in the Skarpnäck borough. However, since the area's construction in the 1980s, the police and Stockholm Municipality publish their statistics for Skarpnäcks gård separately between Skarpnäcksfältet and Pungpinan (the two subdistricts). Skarpnäcksfältet accounts for the majority of the Skarpnäcks gård district's population, and is colloquially referred to as Skarpnäck. Skarpnäcksfältet is served by a metro station named Skarpnäck, contributing to the name confusion. Skarpnäcksfältet neighbours Flaten to the southeast, Orhem to the south, Sköndal in the Farsta borough to the southwest, Pungpinan to the northwest, Bagarmossen to the north, and the nature reserve Nackareservatet in Nacka Municipality to the east.  Transportation  The Skarpnäck metro station is located below ground, and has one entrance on Skarpnäcks Allé. The original plan was to have two entrances, the other one located south of the current one, but those plans were never carried out. Skarpnäck metro station opened in 1994, making it the 100th and newest station of the Stockholm Metro. Skarpnäck is the terminus of the green line 17, a role it took from Bagarmossen in 1994. A number of buses also pass through Skarpnäcksfältet - 180 between Kärrtorp and Orhem, 811 between Gullmarsplan and Älta and 816 between Gullmarsplan and Tyresö Centrum. 181 to Farsta strand, 172 to Norsborg and 173 to Skärholmen all have their terminus on Skarpnäcksfältet.  Architecture  Pilotgatan, Skarpnäcksfältet. View of northern Skarpnäcksfältet from the Bagarmossen side. Skarpnäcks Allé, Skarpnäcksfältet. The construction of Skarpnäcksstaden began in the early 1980s. This was a few years after the finish of the Million Programme, a project designed to offer everyone a reasonably priced home by building one million dwellings in a 10-year period, 1965 to 1974. While the project succeeded, it was heavily criticized for the buildings' lack of aesthetics, the common image of a Million Programme building being a large, gray apartment complex of cement in a monotone dormitory suburb. Thus, with the planning of Skarpnäcksstaden, time was spent to assure that the mistakes of the Million Programme were not repeated. The area was to move away from the mass production-style of the Million Programme, instead focusing on a variation of houses and apartments. Skarpnäcksstaden was intended to be a complete small town in itself, with housing, workplaces and schools. In all, the classical elements of a small town inspired the design of Skarpnäcksfältet greatly, for instance in the structure of blocks with streets, squares and courtyards. The characteristical orange-red brick buildings of Skarpnäcksfältet have received international attention, partially because the relatively large area consists of exclusively such buildings. Other than the apartment buildings, a number of row-houses and an industrial area were built around the same time, painted in similar colours to fit with the rest of Skarpnäcksfältet. The design, by architect Leif Blomquist, has received several awards for its extraordinarity. Skarpnäcksfältet has considerably few connections with other districts, giving it the image of a slightly isolated area, and some argue that a road to Bagarmossen with new housing developments would lead to a better integration of Skarpnäcksfältet, while others think that the nature between the two areas should be preserved.  Housing  Between 1982 and 1990, 3,390 apartments were built on Skarpnäcksfältet. On December 31, 1990, 1,419 of those were publicly owned rental apartments, 736 were privately owned rental apartments and 1,235 were condominiums. As of December 31, 2009, there are 3,564 apartments on Skarpnäcksfältet - 1,323 publicly owned rental apartments, 194 privately owned rental apartments and 2,047 condominiums. There are also 277 other dwellings, mostly row-houses. As of December 31, 2009, there are 332 studio apartments, 1,155 two-room apartments, 1,199 three-room apartments, 816 four-room apartments and 150 five-room apartments. Most of the other 277 dwellings have four or five rooms. Given that there were many big apartments on Skarpnäcksfältet, plenty of families with children moved there, which lead to Skarpnäcksfältet having the highest child density (highest number of children per square km) in northern Europe during the mid-90s.  Demographics  Skarpnäcksfältet has 8,734 inhabitants as of December 31, 2009. People with a foreign background (born outside Sweden, or with both parents born outside Sweden) made up for 42.8% of Skarpnäcksfältet's population, compared to 26.6% of the entire Skarpnäck borough, and 28.7% of Stockholm as a whole. The unemployment rate of Skarpnäcksfältet was 4.8% on October 31, 2009. In comparison, 3.8% of the Skarpnäck borough population were unemployed, and 3.6% of Stockholm as a whole. The average income on Skarpnäcksfältet was 227,000 Swedish kronor, this was below the Skarpnäck borough average of 250,200 Swedish kronor as well as the Stockholm average of 294,500 Swedish kronor.

The genus is widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical regions, particularly southern Asia and the Americas. A few species extend to temperate regions, with ca. 10 species in the United States, mostly in the southern states from California to Florida, and only two species in Canada; China has 35 species, also mostly southern. Only one species (E. aquaticum) occurs in Europe, where it is confined to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Scotland and Ireland;Sculthorpe, C. D. The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Edward Arnold. London. 1967. Reprinted 1985. Figure 11.6. this species also occurs in eastern North America and is thought to be a relatively recent natural colonist in Europe. In the Americas, Eriocaulon is the only genus in its family that occurs north of Florida. They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods. In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses. Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.Wilson, S. D. and P. A. Keddy. 1986. Species competitive ability and position along a natural stress/disturbance gradient. Ecology 67:1236-1242. Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.Keddy, P. A. and A. A. Reznicek. 1982. The role of seed banks in the persistence of Ontario's coastal plain flora. American Journal of Botany 69:13-22. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek εριον, , meaning 'wool', and καυλός, , meaning 'stalk'. The species are mostly herbaceous perennial plants, though some are annual plants; they resemble plants in the related families Cyperaceae (sedges) and Juncaceae (rushes), and like them, have rather small, wind-pollinated flowers.

Note: In a computer security context, spoofing refers to various forms of falsification of data that are unrelated to the techniques discussed here. See spoofing attack. Spoofing techniques In most applications of protocol spoofing, a communications device such as a modem or router simulates (\\"spoofs\\") the remote endpoint of a connection to a locally attached host, while using a more appropriate protocol to communicate with a compatible remote device that performs the equivalent spoof at the other end of the communications link. File transfer spoofing Error correction and file transfer protocols typically work by calculating a checksum or CRC for a block of data known as a packet, and transmitting the resulting number at the end of the packet. At the other end of the connection, the receiver re-calculates the number based on the data it received and compares that result to what was sent from the remote machine. If the two match the packet was transmitted correctly, and the receiver sends an \`ACK\` to signal that it's ready to receive the next packet. The time to transmit the \`ACK\` back to the sender is a function of the phone lines, as opposed to the modem's speed, and is typically about of a second on short links and may be much longer on long-distance links or data networks like X.25. For a protocol using small packets, this delay can be larger than the time needed to send a packet. For instance, the UUCP \\"g\\" protocol and Kermit both use 64-byte packets, which on a 9600 bit/s link takes about of a second to send. XMODEM used a slightly larger 128-byte packet, which takes about of a second to send. The next packet of data cannot be sent until the \`ACK\` for the previous packet is received. In the case of XMODEM, for instance, that means it takes a minimum of of a second for the entire cycle to complete for a single packet. This means that the overall speed is only half the theoretical maximum, a 50% channel efficiency. Protocol spoofing addresses this problem by having the local modem recognize that a data transfer is underway, often by looking for packet headers. When these are seen, the modem then looks for the end of the packet, normally by knowing the number of bytes in a single packet. XMODEM, for instance, has 132 bytes in a packet due to the header and checksum being added to the 128 bytes of actual data. When the modem sees the packet has ended, it immediately sends of spoofed \`ACK\` message back to the host. This causes the local computer to immediately send another packet, avoiding the latency of waiting for an \`ACK\` from the remote machine. The data for multiple packets is held in an internal buffer while the modem is sending it to the remote machine. This allows the packets to be sent continually, greatly improving channel efficiency. However, this also requires the link between the two systems to be error-free, as the modem has already \`ACK\`ed the packets even before they have been sent. This was normally addressed by using a modem- level error correction protocol, like Microcom Networking Protocols. Protocol spoofing was also widely used with another feature of earlier high-speed modems. Before the introduction of echo cancellation in v.32 and later protocols, high-speed modems typically had a very slow \\"backchannel\\" for sending things like these \`ACK\`s back to the sender. On the ~18,500 bit/s TrailBlazer, for instance, the modem could send as many as 35 UUCP packets a second to the receiver, but the backchannel offered only 75 bit/s, not nearly enough for the 35 bytes, 280 bits, of \`ACK\` messages generated by the remote host. In this case, the spoofing allowed the sending modem to continue sending packets as fast as it could. At the same time, the modem on the remote receiving end dropped the \`ACK\` packets being generated by the local computer's software, keeping the backchannel clear. Since the channel efficiency only became a major problem at speeds over 2400 bit/s, and modems able to run faster than that typically had significant processing power anyway, protocol spoofing was mostly associated with these higher-speed systems. TCP spoofing TCP connections may suffer from performance limitations due to insufficient window size for links with high bandwidth- delay product, and on long-delay links such as those over GEO satellites, TCP's slow-start algorithm significantly delays connection startup. A spoofing router terminates the TCP connection locally and translates the TCP to protocols tailored to long delays over the satellite link such as XTP. RIP/SAP spoofing SAP and RIP periodically broadcast network information even if routing/service tables are unchanged. dial-on-demand WAN links in IPX networks therefore never become idle and won't disconnect. A spoofing router or modem will intercept the SAP and RIP broadcasts, and re-broadcast the advertisements from its own routing/service table that it only updates when the link is active for other reasons.

They played in the Central Hockey League from 2006 to 2014 with their home games at Tim's Toyota Center. History The Sundogs served as an affiliate for the NHL's Colorado Avalanche during the 2006-2007 season and as an affiliate for the Phoenix Coyotes in the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons. The Sundogs concluded their inaugural season in 2006-07 with 70 points and a 34-28-2 record, finishing second in the CHL's Southwest Division, two points back of eventual division champion the New Mexico Scorpions, and qualifying for the 2007 CHL Playoffs. Arizona went on to beat the Corpus Christi Rayz, 2-1, in overtime of Game 7 of the opening round, advancing to the Southern Conference Semifinals against division rival New Mexico. The Sundogs eventually fell, 3-2, to the Scorpions in Game 7. Brent Kelly represented the Sundogs in the 2007 CHL All-Star Game and led the CHL in goals in 2006-07 with 42 and finished third overall with 95 points. During the 2007-08 season, the team clinched the CHL's Southwest Division regular season title, finishing with 84 points and a 39-19-6 record. Phoenix Coyotes prospect Alex Leavitt lead the league in scoring (128 points) and assists (88). The Sundogs opened the 2008 Ray Miron President's Cup Playoffs defeating New Mexico 4 games to 2. They then defeated the 2007-08 Southern Conference regular season champion Laredo Bucks 4 games to 3 in the Southern Conference Finals before sweeping the defending Ray Miron President's Cup Champion Colorado Eagles in four straight games, winning the President's Cup in only their second year of existence. Goaltender Rob McVicar was named playoffs MVP, finishing with an 11-1 record and .913 save percentage. Leavitt, Tyler Redenbach and David Schlemko represented the Sundogs in the 2008 CHL All-Star Game as Head Coach and General Manager Marco Pietroniro coached the Southern Conference All-Stars to an 11-6 win. In 2008-09 the Sundogs finished with 59 points and a 27-32-5 record and in 2009-10 the team finished with 54 points and a 24-34-6 mark. Joel Irving was the team's lone representative in the 2009 All-Star game, tallying a goal in an 8-4 loss to the Colorado Eagles while Jon Landry was named to the 2010 All-Star Game. Landry recorded a goal and an assist in a 9-4 loss to the South Texas All-Stars. Arizona closed out the 2010-11 regular season with a 25-31-10 record for 60 points, qualifying for the postseason for the third time in five seasons and first since the team's championship season in 2007-08. The Sundogs dropped their opening round best- of-5 playoff series 3-1 to the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs. Kyle Hood finished as the team's leading scorer for the second straight season with 69 points (15g/54a) in 62 games. Second-year forward Joey Sides was the team's lone representative in the 2011 CHL All-Star Game, recording one assist and three shots in an 11-6 win over the host Rapid City Rush. The Sundogs and Tim's Toyota Center have been named hosts of the 2012 Central Hockey League All-Star Game.

The two locomotives differed only in trucks, with the S-2 using ALCO \\"Blunt\\" trucks, and the S-4 using AAR type A switcher trucks. Both were powered by ALCO 539 turbocharged, 6-cylinder diesels. The S-2 was built between August 1940 and June 1950, with a total of 1502 completed, while the S-4 was constructed between June 1949 and August 1957 (MLW until 1957) with total sales of 797. Canadian production of the S-4 started more than a year before U S production of the S-4. ALCO did not start building the S-4 until August 1950. A modified version, the S-7, was built by MLW only; 29 were built between June and August 1957. Design The exterior of the locomotives were styled by an Alco engineer, Ray Patten, using curves in a mild application of Art Deco principles. Identification The S-2 and S-4 are distinguishable externally from the very similar S-1 and S-3 switchers in that they have a larger exhaust stack with an oblong base and a larger radiator shutter area on the nose sides. The S-1/S-3 radiator shutter area is taller than it is wide, while the S-2/S-4 radiator area is wider. The larger stack is due to turbocharging. The carbody and cab of late S-2s are nearly indistinguishable from those of S-4s. Hence, a truck swap can cause many to misidentify a unit. Survivors A few S-4s are still in service on shortline railroads around the United States. Several more are preserved in US and Canadian railroad museums. An S-2, of D&RGW; heritage, survives on the Big South Fork Scenic Railway, as number 102. It was purchased in February 1964 for the Kentucky and Tennessee Railway, and is in operable condition in Stearns, Kentucky. This was one of the diesels that replaced Southern 2-8-2 #4501 on the K&T.; Southern Pacific 1474 is in operation, in rotation, at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, CA, pulling a tourist train on weekends. Western Pacific 563, one of 2 S-4s purchased by that railroad, is today preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California. Fore River Transportation had one S-4 in a derelict state being used for parts until it was scrapped in 2011. New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway S2 #206 sits cosmetically restored at Maywood Station in Maywood, New Jersey. The Cooperstown and Charlotte Valley Railroad operates a pair of restored ex- Canadian National units S-4 #3051 (formally CN #8181) and S-7 #3052 (formally CN #8223). In 2017, they had acquired the former Concord and Claremont Railroad ALCO S-4 units S-4 #102 (formally D&H; #3050) and S-4 #104 (formally D&H; #3036). As of 2020, all but #104 were operational on the tourist passenger and maintenance of way services between Milford and Cooperstown, NY.

The CMC joint of the thumb or the first CMC joint, also known as the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint, differs significantly from the other four CMC joints and is therefore described separately.  Thumb  Bones of a human wrist. In this photo both the free position and the saddle shape of the first CMC joint and the proximal transverse palmar arch are clearly visible. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb (pollex), also known as the first carpometacarpal joint, or the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMC) because it connects the trapezium to the first metacarpal bone, plays an irreplaceable role in the normal functioning of the thumb. The most important joint connecting the wrist to the metacarpus, osteoarthritis of the TMC is a severely disabling condition; up to twenty times more common among elderly women than in average. Pronation-supination of the first metacarpal is especially important for the action of opposition. The movements of the first CMC are limited by the shape of the joint, by the capsulo-ligamentous complex surrounding the joint, and by the balance among involved muscles. If the first metacarpal fails to sit well 'on the saddle', for example because of hypoplasia, the first CMC joint tends to be subluxated (i.e. slightly displaced) towards the radius. The capsule is sufficiently slack to allow a wide range of movements and a distraction of roughly 3 mm, while reinforcing ligaments and tendons give stability to the joint. It is slightly thicker on its dorsal side than on the other. The first carpometacarpal joint is a frequent site of osteoarthritis in postmenopausal women.  Ligaments  The description of the number and names of the ligaments of the first CMC varies considerably in anatomical literature. describe three intracapsular and two extracapsular ligaments to be most important in stabilizing the thumb: ; Anterior oblique ligament (AOL): A strong, thick, and intracapsular ligament originating on the palmar tubercle of the trapezium to be inserted on the palmar tubercle of the first metacarpal. It is taut in abduction, extension, and pronation, and has been reported to have an important retaining function and to be elongated or absent in CMC joint arthritis. ; Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL): An extracapsular ligament, the UCL is located ulnarly to the AOL. It has its origin on the flexor retinaculum and is inserted on the ulnopalmar tubercle of the first metacarpal. It is taut in abduction, extension, and pronation, and often found elongated in connection to CMC joint arthritis. The importance ascribed to the UCL varies considerably among researchers. ; First intermetacarpal ligament (IML): Connecting the bases of the second and first metacarpals, this ligament inserts onto the ulnopalmar tubercle of the first metacarpal where its fibers intermingle with those of the UCL. It is taut in abduction, opposition, and supination. It has been reported to be the most important restraining structure of the first CMC joint by several researchers. Some consider it too weak to be able to stabilize the joint by itself, yet accept that together with the UCL it represents an important restraining structure. ; Posterior oblique ligament (POL): An intracapsular ligament stretching from the dorsoulnar side of the trapezium to the ulno-palmar tubercle of the first metacarpal. Not considered an important ligament to the first CMC joint, it tightens during forced adduction and radial abduction. ; Dorsoradial ligament (DRL): Like the previous ligament, the DRL is not considered important to the first CMC. It connects the dorsal sides of the trapezium and the first metacarpal. Early, anatomically correct drawings of the ligaments of the first carpometacarpal joints were produced by .  Movements  In this articulation the movements permitted are flexion and extension in the plane of the palm of the hand, abduction and adduction in a plane at right angles to the palm, circumduction, and opposition. * It is by the movement of opposition that the tip of the thumb is brought into contact with the volar surfaces of the slightly flexed fingers. This movement is effected through the medium of a small sloping facet on the anterior lip of the saddle-shaped articular surface of the greater multangular (trapezium). The flexor muscles pull the corresponding part of the articular surface of the metacarpal bone on to this facet, and the movement of opposition is then carried out by the adductors. * Flexion of this joint is produced by the flexor pollicis longus and brevis, assisted by the opponens pollicis and the adductor pollicis. * Extension is effected mainly by the abductor pollicis longus, assisted by the extensores pollicis longus and brevis. * Adduction is carried out by the adductor; abduction mainly by the abductor pollicis longus and brevis, assisted by the extensors. Range of motion for the first CMC is 53° of flexion/extension, 42° of abduction/adduction, and 17° of rotation. ; Planes and axes of movements The thumb's MP and CMC joints abduct and adduct in a plane perpendicular to the palm, a movement also referred to as \\"palmar abduction.\\" The same joints flex and extend in a plane parallel to the palm, also referred to as \\"radial abduction,\\" because the thumb moves toward the hand's radial side. Abduction and adduction occur around an antero-posterior axis, while flexion and extension occur around a lateral axis. For ease of orientation, the thumbnail can be considered as resting in the thumb's frontal plane. Abduction and adduction of the first CMC (and MP) joint(s) occur in this plane; flexion and extension of the first CMC, MP, and IP joints occur in a plane that is perpendicular to the thumbnail. This remains true regardless of how the first metacarpal bone is being rotated during opposition and reposition.  Sexual dimorphism  Male and female thumb CMC joints are different in some aspects. In women, the trapezial articular surface is significantly smaller than the metacarpal surface, and its shape also differs from that of males. While most thumb CMC joints are more congruent in the radioulnar direction than the dorsovolar, female CMC joints are less globally congruent than male joints.  Evolution  A primitive autonomisation of the first ray took place in dinosaurs, while a real differentiation appeared in primitive primates approximately . The shape of the human TMC joint dates back about 5 million years ago. As a result of evolution, the human thumb CMC joint has positioned itself at 80° of pronation, 40° of abduction, and 50° of flexion in relation to an axis passing through the stable second and third CMC joints.  Fingers  Section through the human wrist X-ray of a human hand * The second metacarpal articulates primarily with the trapezoid and secondarily with the trapezium and capitate. * The third metacarpal articulates primarily with the capitate, * The fourth metacarpal articulates with the capitate and hamate. * The fifth metacarpal articulates with the hamate. Among themselves, the four ulnar metacarpals also articulates with their neighbours at the intermetacarpal articulations.  Ligaments  These four CMC joints are supported by strong transverse and weaker longitudinal ligaments: the dorsal carpometacarpal ligaments and the volar or palmar carpometacarpal ligaments. The interosseous ligaments consist of short, thick fibers, and are limited to one part of the carpometacarpal articulation; they connect the contiguous inferior angles of the capitate and hamate with the adjacent surfaces of the third and fourth metacarpal bones.  Movements  The carpometacarpal joints of second through fifth digits are arthrodial. The movements permitted in the second through fifth carpometacarpal joints most readily observable in the (distal) heads of the metacarpal bones. The range of motions in these joints decrease from the fifth to the second CMCs. The second to fifth joints are synovial ellipsoidal joints with a nominal degree of freedom (flexion/extension). The second and third joints are however essentially immobile and can be considered to have zero degrees of freedom in practice. These two CMC provide the other three CMCs with a fixed and stable axis. While the mobility of the fourth CMC joint thus is perceptible, the first joint is a saddle joint with two degrees of freedom which except flexion/extension also enable abduction/adduction and a limited amount of opposition. Together the movements of the fourth and fifth CMCs facilitates for their fingers to oppose the thumb.  Function  The function of the finger carpometacarpal joints and their segments overall is to contribute to the palmar arch system together with the thumb. The proximal transverse arch of the palm is formed by the distal row of carpal bones. The concavity of this arch is augmented at the level of the metacarpal heads by the flexibility of the first, fourth, and fifth metacarpal heads around the fixed second and third metacarpal heads; a flexible structure called the distal transverse arch. For each finger there is also a longitudinal arch. Together, these arches allow the palm and the digits to conform optimally to objects as we grasp them (so-called palmar cupping). Furthermore, as the amount of surface contact is maximized, stability is enhanced and sensory feedback increases. The deep transverse metacarpal ligament stabilises the mobile parts of the palmar arch system. As the fingers are being flexed, palmar cupping is contributed to by muscles crossing the carpometacarpal joints when they act on the mobile parts of the palmar arch system. The oblique opponens digiti minimi muscle acts on the fifth carpometacarpal joint and is the only muscle that act on the carpometacarpal joints alone. It is optimally positioned to flex and rotate the fifth metacarpal bone about its long axis. Palmar arching is further increased when [flexor carpi ulnaris] (which is attached to the pisiform) and intrinsic hand muscles attached to the transverse carpal ligament acts on the arch system. The fixed second and third carpometacarpal joints are crossed by the radial wrist muscles (flexor carpi radialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, and extensor carpi radialis brevis). The stability of these two carpometacarpal joints is a functional adaptation that enhances the efficiency of these muscles at the midcarpal and radiocarpal joints.  Synovial membranes  The synovial membrane is a continuation of that of the intercarpal joints. Occasionally, the joint between the hamate and the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones has a separate synovial membrane. The synovial membranes of the wrist and carpus are thus seen to be five in number: * The first passes from the lower end of the ulnar to the ulnar notch of the radius, and lines the upper surface of the articular disk. * The second passes from the articular disk and the lower end of the radius above, to the bones of the first row below. * The third, the most extensive, passes between the contiguous margins of the two rows of carpal bones, and sometimes, in the event of one of the interosseous ligaments being absent, between the bones of the second row to the carpal extremities of the second, third, fourth, and fifth metacarpal bones. * The fourth extends from the margin of the greater multangular to the metacarpal bone of the thumb. * The fifth runs between the adjacent margins of the triangular and pisiform bones. Occasionally the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints have a separate synovial membrane. Clinical significance Osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joints is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. When it affects the thumb it is termed trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis. Carpometacarpal bossing is the presence of a small immovable protuberance over the joint.

It was opened in 1965 as a part of a major plan to rationalise all aspects of the rail services in the Sheffield area, and closed in stages from 1985 with the run-down of rail freight in Britain. It was also the site of Tinsley Traction Maintenance Depot (TMD), which was closed in 1998. At its peak, 200 locomotives were allocated to this depot. As of 2011 an intermodal (road-rail) freight terminal Sheffield International Rail Freight Terminal (SIRFT) is located on part of the site (built late 2000s). A set of sidings is operated by DB Schenker Rail (UK) serving the nearby Outokumpu steel works. History In 1961, a tenth of the rail-borne freight in Britain originated in the Sheffield district. However, as with many areas, the provision of freight facilities had grown through cramped, piecemeal developments associated with the various operating companies that built Britain's rail system. With the region being one of the main heavy industry heartlands of Britain, government money was made available to remedy this situation. Central economic planning and economic self-sufficiency were government policy; the situation was seen as a major limit on Britain's economic growth. Tinsley yard in 1974. The Sheffield district rail rationalisation plan of the 1960s called for the replacement of the majority of the marshalling yards in the Sheffield area with one large yard. A location on the Sheffield District line was chosen and work started in 1963 with new connections being built at Treeton, Broughton Lane and Tinsley South. The 80 yard Tinsley Wood Tunnel and approach cuttings were filled with some of the material excavated from the new yard, the remaining material being transported to a tip at Orgreave. The location allowed easy access to the brand new central Sheffield Freight Terminal at Grimesthorpe, and the new Freightliner terminal on the site of the Masborough Sorting Sidings in Rotherham, one of the many yards that Tinsley replaced. The locomotive depot opened in 1964, with diesel locomotives moving in from a temporary home in the old Grimesthorpe steam locomotive depot and Darnall diesel (former electric locomotive) depot, Darnall steam locomotive depot being closed to become a wagon-repair depot. Other steam locomotive depots at Millhouses and Canklow were closed and the last steam locomotives based in the Sheffield area were scrapped, along with many redundant sidings dotted about the area. The Tinsley complex was opened by Dr Richard Beeching, former Chairman of the British Railways Board, on 29 October 1965. The yard Tinsley Yard (1982) From its outset, Tinsley was to be a \\"network yard\\": a major railfreight node where wagon-load freight trains would arrive, be split and sorted into new trains for onward departure to other network yards, directly to the many rail- connected businesses in the area in \\"trip\\" freights, or to the freight terminal for unloading and forwarding by road. To assist with this, it featured gravity-assisted shunting and a new computerised system of wagon control, along the lines of large US rail freight yards. At the time of opening, the yard was handling 3,000 wagons a day. Incoming trains were split in the 11 reception sidings, propelled over the hump in the yard, from where the individual wagons rolled down a slope and were automatically sorted into new trains on the yard's 50 main sorting sidings. The yard had its own dedicated class of shunting locomotive (British Rail Class 13) for this purpose as BR's standard class of shunting locomotive was not powerful enough. Each of the main sorting sidings was fitted with computer-controlled retarders to either slow the rolling wagons down before they hit other wagons already on the siding, or give wagons rolling too slowly a boost to move them along to the correct position in a particular siding. This wagon-control system, manufactured by Dowty, was very complex, needed almost constant maintenance, and crucially could not handle the longer wheelbase wagons that were already becoming prevalent and required individual shunting. There was an express freight and departure yard of 10 sidings, and a 25-road secondary yard for local freight trains (with its own hump). The Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electrification was extended into the yard in 1965 to allow electrically- hauled trains to the Manchester area to be handled. Seventeen miles of track from Woodburn Junction and Darnall Junction via Broughton Lane to the Reception Sidings at Catcliffe were electrified at 1500 V DC. The insulators were capable of being used at 6.25 kV AC if ever required, with the option of 25 kV AC with minimal conversion costs. Unlike similar electrified marshalling yards, to save on costs the main body of the sorting sidings was not electrified: a half of the arrival sidings was electrified for incoming electric trains; departing electric trains either had to use the southern third of the main sorting sidings (the western part of which were wired for electric trains) or had to be drawn out of the main sorting sidings by diesel locomotives into electrified departure roads where the electric locomotives were attached. Decline Tinsley Yard (2005) From an early stage the yard was not used at capacity: by the late 1960s road competition was biting hard into the railways' goods traffic, and in particular the wagon-load freight that required hump-yards like Tinsley was already declining. The economic malaise and industrial decline of the 1970s exacerbated this. By the 1980s British Rail was closing its remaining wagon-load freight facilities as being uneconomic. In 1981 the electrification was removed with the closure of the Manchester-Sheffield-Wath system. On 17 December 1984 the arrival sidings and hump were closed, the wagon-control system removed and the remaining Class 13s scrapped. The under-utilised Grimesthorpe Freight Terminal was severely damaged by a major fire on 14 December 1984 and was relegated to being a steel-loading facility. The yard connections were relaid to allow easier handling of block-load trains which now dominated rail freight in Britain. By 1995 the decline in British heavy industry meant that this type of traffic had also declined massively, resulting in the closure of the locomotive depot on 27 March 1998. The eastern connections (both north- and south-facing chords) to the Midland 'Old Road' were closed in 1993 however the track is still in situ, and the western connection to the Midland Main Line (and goods depot at Grimesthorpe) at Brightside junction was lifted in 1999. Both chords to the ex MSLR/GCR line from Woodburn to Rotherham (via Broughton Lane junction and Tinsley South junction) remain open. The rest of the yard progressively fell into disuse over the next ten years. A few years later only the main sorting sidings remained: a part of these were to be used to stable steel trains destined for the Sheffield area; the rest of the remaining sidings were used to store surplus-to-requirements rolling stock in a poor state of repair. However, in 2007 the remaining sidings were lifted and a new, much smaller yard laid, additionally a new rail-linked distribution and goods transshipment centre - Sheffield International Rail Freight Terminal (SIRFT) was constructed. Post hump yard, 2000- In 2006 the sidings at Tinsley reached the national news when Daniel Matthews, an engineering apprentice, took to the site and joyrode a Class 08 shunting engine up and down the tracks. In 2008 EWS operated the sidings at Tinsley. As of 2011 the DB Cargo UK yard handles steel for Avesta Sheffield (now part of Outokumpu). Sheffield International Rail Freight Terminal In the mid-2000s, land adjacent to the northwestern area of the former yard was used for the construction of the Sheffield International Rail Freight Terminal (SIRFT). The terminal consists of two warehouses of approximately . SIRFT is rail connected with through connections southwards and northwards, and is equipped to deal with conventional and containerised wagon loads. A third rail connected warehousing unit (of up to approximately ) has approval for construction (as of 2011). In 2017 it was reported that the loading gauge had been increased to the W10 standard to allow the facility to handle 2.9 m (9 ft 6 in) Hi-Cube containers.

Biography Born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, he was a son of Oliver Ames Sr. and Susannah (Angier) Ames, and a brother of Oakes Ames.Spencer Marks (2005), The Ames Family of North Easton, MA . Retrieved December 29, 2005.Union Pacific Railroad, Union Pacific: Significant Individuals . Retrieved December 29, 2005. Young Oliver attended public schools for a few years, then Franklin Academy in North Andover. He briefly entered the law field, but left to help in the family shovel business. By 1844, Oliver and his brother Oakes Ames entered into partnership with their father, operating under the company name of Oliver Ames & Sons. It was a good time to be in the shovel business, as the nation was experiencing a dramatic expansion of canals, railroads, and other major infrastructure, all of which were built by men swinging shovels. Oliver Ames Jr. served as president of Union Pacific Railroad (UP) while the railroad was busy building the First Transcontinental Railroad in North America. He was its president pro tem from 1866 until 1868, and was formally elected president of the company on March 12, 1868. He continued as president until March 8, 1871. His tenure was marked by controversy since his 1866 ascent to the presidency was over Thomas C. Durant who had tried to gain the position for himself. Durant filed lawsuits against Ames that stopped construction, and Ames retaliated by garnering support to remove Durant from the railroad's executive committee. A divided board of directors was beyond Ames' management capabilities, and he finally acquiesced to readmitting Durant in 1867, and Crédit Mobilier awarded Ames a new construction contract.PBS; The American Experience, People & Events: Oakes Ames (1804-1873). Retrieved December 29, 2005. In 1873, Ames succeeded his brother as the head of Crédit Mobilier. Oliver Ames Jr. served in the Massachusetts State Senate in 1852 and 1857. He was a Whig and later a Republican. Personal life Starting around 1826, Oliver became involved in the temperance movement; he was said to be the first man in Easton to sign a temperance pledge. Ames married Sarah Lothrop on June 11, 1833. Sarah was daughter of Howard Lothrop of Easton, Massachusetts. They had two children: Frederick Lothrop Ames and Helen Angier. Like the rest of his family, Oliver Jr. was a devoted Unitarian, and attended Unitarian churches in Easton and North Easton. In 1875, Ames hired his nephew, John Ames Mitchell, to design the Unity Church of North Easton, at a cost of $100,000, and on his death he left a bequest to keep the church in repair. Death and legacy Bas relief by Augustus Saint-Gaudens Ames died at North Easton on March 9, 1877. He left $50,000 in his will for the construction of a library. The will stipulated that it was to be a private institution, not owned by the town, but operated in trust for the public. The request was carried out by his children, Frederick Lothrop Ames and Helen Angier Ames. They hired Henry Hobson Richardson to design the Ames Free Library. The final cost of the building came to at least $80,000. Medallions in the library honor Ames with his likeness. The contributions of Ames and his brother Oakes in the building of the Union Pacific are commemorated in the Oliver and Oakes Ames Monument at Sherman Summit, near Laramie, Wyoming, along the original route. The pyramidal monument was designed by famous architect Henry Hobson Richardson (who designed a number of projects for the Ames family) with sculpted plaques of the Ames brothers by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. At the time of its construction, the monument was located at the highest point attained by the Union Pacific's transcontinental route. With a change in the route of the railroad, the monument today is not on any major transportation route.

It can be reached by the main island road from town of Korčula. The road runs through the forests in the middle of the island of Korčula. Geography The town was amphitheatrically built on several hills around a small central valley (40 km away from the town of Korčula). A long avenue of lime trees called Zlinje runs through it, along with the towns public buildings (recently built: schools, hotel, bank, shops, municipal building, medical centre etc.). There is a City park that provides exceptional shade during the summer months. The climate in Blato matches the entire island of Korčula - it is located in the Adriatic which has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by long, quiet, dry and hot summer days with clear, short and mild wet winters. During the entire year the temperatures go below 10 °C in January and February, while June, July, August and September they average above 20 °C. Rainfall is typically Mediterranean, with a peak in late autumn and early winter and a minimum in July. History Blato got its name from a neighbouring field which flooded on regular basis, until 1911. The Blato field was occasionally drained. This created a lake that dried up during summer. The construction of canals and tunnels channelled drainage water into the sea on the north coast. It created conditions for successful exploitation of more fertile land in this region. The town itself is one of the oldest settlements on Korčula and is situated in the middle of the western part of a field. The area of Blato is believed to have been settled during Roman times. There is a church, Our Lady of the Field, located on the Blato Field that has Roman floors that place its beginnings in the 4th century. Archaeological remains of Roman Junianum (agricultural estate) have been discovered. Other remains have been found in the local area dating back to prehistoric and Illyrian times. Between World War I and World War II, phylloxera attacked the grape vines, causing them to perish en masse. This greatly contributed to the economic crisis that was happening within the newly formed Yugoslavia. Blato was facing a mass exodus. It was the sixth largest place in Dalmatia, then a region of Austro-Hungary (Blato in 1910 had a population of 7102 ). During 1924 and 1925, about 890 residents abandoned their homes and left Blato. Whole families emigrated. to Australia and Brazil (especially São Paulo).Norma Marinovic Doro, Narrativa épica e imigração, anpuhsp.org.br; accessed 3 December 2015.http://mojahrvatska.vecernji.hr/zivot-hrvatice-u-brazilu-sretni-smo-ako- se-probudimo-1090417 During World War II Blato was bombed by the Allies. Municipality of Blato The Municipality of Blato, situated on the island of Korčula, administratively falls under the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. The municipality is made up of Blato and Potirna. It has access to the sea on both sides of the island. Once the main port of Blato, Prigradica is located about 3 km north of the town of Blato. The municipality's coastline is 36.3 kilometers in length. Within the area are olive trees and vineyards. Demographics According to the 2011 census, the Municipality of Blato has population of 3,593. The vast majority of the population are Roman Catholics. The municipality consists of following settlements: *Blato - 3,570 *Potirna - 23 Economy Lipa avenue in Blato, Korčula. During the long history of Blato, the economy has been oriented around the production of agricultural products, especially wine. Olive oil, wine, carob and fig trees are the most significant products of the region. In the early 20th century Blato produced over 1000 carts of wine and 30 wagons of olive oil for export. In addition, they produced legumes and cereals for their own use. Strong development of agriculture led to the development of ancillary services such as crafts and commercial activities. After the Second World War, Blato began a new cycle of development. They further developed the metal industry, textile industry, tourism and the agricultural industry. The population continued to decline, albeit more slowly than before. Industrial production in Blato, in recent times has seen a down turn with the closure of the textile factory Trikop. Metal industry and agriculture remains important for the economy. Tourism now plays an important role. Hotels and private apartments in Prizba and Prigadica have given new momentum to the economy of Blato. The main economic entities in Blato today are: *Radež Inc., a company manufacturing marine equipment and steel structures, the largest employer on the island *Blato 1902 dd company for the purchase, processing and trade of agricultural products. *Small artisans (craft and other services associated in the Association of Craftsmen) *Individual agricultural production of wine and olive oil *Tourism (rental apartments and houses for rent, hotels) *Trade (trade houses and chains) *Plumbing Blato dd *Eko doo Company for Utilities *Schools, municipalities and other government institutions and offices.

In 1948, she was sold to Taiwan, where she served as Taihu (太湖) until 1972. History=United States Navy (1943-1948) The ship was named for George Breeman, a Navy seaman who was awarded the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism during a turret explosion on USS Kearsarge (BB-5). Breeman (DE-104) was laid down on 20 March 1943 at the Dravo Corporation shipyard in Wilmington, Delaware; launched on 4 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Marie Breeman Schellgell, niece of the late Chief Turret Captain Breeman; completed at the Norfolk Navy Yard; and commissioned there on 12 December 1943, with Lieutenant Commander Edward N. W. Hunter, USNR, in command. The destroyer escort spent the remainder of 1943 and the first week in 1944 outfitting at Norfolk. On 11 January 1944, she embarked upon her shakedown cruise to the waters around Bermuda. She completed the training period on 1 February and returned to Norfolk on 5 February for post- shakedown repairs. On 16 February, Breeman steamed out of Chesapeake Bay as an element of Escort Division (CortDiv) 48 which itself made up a part of the screen of Task Group (TG) 21.16, a hunter-killer group built around . After fueling off Fayal in the Azores, the task group headed north to provide antisubmarine support for transatlantic convoys. Though Breeman appears to have taken no direct part in the attacks, the task group accounted for at least two U-boats before entering Casablanca on 8 March. The destroyer escort put to sea with the Block Island task group again on 12 March. On the 19th, planes from Block Island sank , and Breeman assisted in the rescue of the U-boat's survivors. Breeman and parted company with TG 21.16 on 23 March. The following day, the two destroyer escorts put into Dakar, French West Africa, and began loading an unusual cargo — 60 million dollars in gold belonging to the Bank of Poland. The two warships departed Dakar on 26 March and proceeded to New York by the most direct and safest route and arrived there on 3 April. Following repairs, Breeman returned to sea on 12 April with another hunter- killer force which formed a portion of the screen for Convoy UGS-39. She and her convoy entered Bizerte, Tunisia, safely on 3 May. On the return voyage, the destroyer escort helped to screen Convoy GUS 39, arriving in Norfolk on 29 May. After an availability at the New York Navy Yard, she spent nine days during mid-June engaged in training at Casco Bay, Maine. On 21 June, the destroyer escort headed south to the vicinity of Bermuda where she joined TG 22.10—another hunter-killer group built around Card (CVE-11). Once again, the task group attacked a number of sonar contacts and sank at least one U-boat. Breeman, however, shared none of the credit for the sinking. The warship returned to New York late in August and, after repairs, conducted training at Casco Bay in early September. On 18 September, she rejoined the Card task group near Bermuda for further training. Soon thereafter, Breeman suffered propeller damage that forced her to return to the New York Navy Yard. She completed repairs by 23 October, and put to sea that same day for torpedo training at the Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, and in Casco Bay. On 24 November the destroyer escort and the rest of CortDiv 48 joined company with Card once again to form TG 22.2. For about a month, the warship trained in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) tactics in the waters surrounding Bermuda. She returned to New York on 29 December. Breeman rejoined TG 22.2 on 12 January 1945 to act as plane guard and escort during carrier qualifications off Quonset Point, Rhode Island. On 22 January, the destroyer escort and her colleagues of CortDiv 48 joined Bogue (CVE-9) in shaping a course for Norfolk. In late February and early March, Breeman returned to sea with a hunter-killer group built around Bogue for a fruitless search for German weather submarines purportedly operating to the south of Iceland. She and the rest of her task group entered New York on 17 March. During the first part of April, the destroyer escort conducted training at New London as a unit of a hunter-killer group built around Card. Between 15 April and 5 May, that task group hunted for submarines off the Virginia capes. Later, in May, Breeman moved north to Quonset Point where she served as a plane guard during carrier qualifications. In mid-August, the warship joined Mission Bay (CVE-59) in a voyage to Port Everglades, Florida. Once again plane guard operations occupied her time during the visit to the Florida coast. On 2 October, however, she headed north once again. At the New York Navy Yard, Breeman began the inactivation process. That phase lasted until 13 November when she got underway for Florida again. On 16 November, the destroyer escort arrived in Green Cove Springs, Florida, to begin final preparations for decommissioning. Breeman was decommissioned on 26 April 1946 and berthed with the Green Cove Springs Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Republic of China Navy (1948-1972) She remained there until 29 October 1948 at which time she was transferred to the Nationalist Chinese government based on Taiwan. She was commissioned in their Navy as Taihu (太湖) (DE-24). Her name was struck from the Navy list on 22 December 1948. Honors Breeman earned one battle star for World War II service.

University Of Mysore. Vokkaliga is a Hindu farming community with 54 sub-divisions in Karnataka. They have notable demographic, political, and economic dominance in the southern parts of the Indian state of Karnataka. All sections of the Vokkaliga community, particularly the rural communities, are designated as backward castes in India's reservation system. Etymology Vokkaliga is a Kannada-language word found in some of the earliest available literary works of the language, such as the Kavirajamarga, Pampa Bharata, and Mangaraja's Nighantu. It has been used as an appellation for the cultivator community since time immemorial. Generally, the term has come to mean an agriculturist though various etymological derivations are available, including: Kempe Gowda I chieftain under the Vijayanagara Empire. The city of Bengaluru was founded by Kempe Gowda in 1537. * The word okka or okkalu is a Kannada word for a family or a clan and an okkaliga is a person belonging to such a family. This is an allusion to the totemistic exogamous clans which together form an endogamous sub group, of which there are many amongst the Vokkaligas. These clans are called Bali, Bedagu, Kutumba, Gotra or simply Okkalu all of which mean family. They are named after their progenitor, primary occupation or in most cases after various birds, animals or objects. * Okkalutana in Kannada means agriculture * Alternate etymologies include okku, which means threshing The Kannada linguist Shamba Joshi and others propose a derivation from the Sanskrit - gau (cow) and govala (keeper of Gau/Cow)(Govala->Goula->Gowda). Moreover, though the Vokkaligas did practise animal husbandry, the traditional herdsmen community, Kurubas, form a separate caste group. Subgroups The Vokkaliga community has several sub-groups within its fold. Exogamy at the family/clan level is strictly controlled by using the idiom of Mane Devaru (the patron god of the given exogamic clan) which dictates that the followers of same Mane Devaru are siblings and marriage is thus forbidden, allowing marital alliances only with another clan and not within. Gangadikara Vokkaliga The Gangadikara Gowdas, also known as the Gangatkar With various theories on the origins of the Gangas, this is hard to prove but some scholars do opine that the Gangas were local chieftains who ascertained their power and rose to dominance during the political unrest caused in South India after the invasion of Samudragupta I. It is however, a fact that the administrative setup of Gangas vested power, at various levels of administration and apart from administrative duties the Gauda was expected to raise militia when called for. The Gangadikaras and the Kongu Vellalars are said to share a common origin and they regard themselves Ganga Kshatriyas. In fact, the word Kongu is the Tamil equivalent for Ganga. There is a significant number of Gounders in Kollegal and T. Narsipur in Chamarajanagar. The Gangadikara Vokkaligas have as many as 40 kulas, exogamous clans, known in Kannada as Bedagu. Morasu Vokkaliga The ancestors of Kempe Gowda I of the Yelahanka Nadaprabhus (the founder of Bangalore city and himself a Morasu Vokkaliga) are recorded to have migrated to these districts from Alur of Kanchi around the 15th century under Rana Bhaire Gowda, who built the fort at Devanahalli. According to Burton Stein, the region of modern-day Bangalore and Tumkur districts was known as Morasu Nadu, dominated by the Morasu Vokkaligas. In fact Hosur which borders Bangalore claims to have been called Murasu Nadu during the Sangam Age and has a significant population of Morasu Vokkaligas. The four main sub-divisions being the Musuku, Hosadevru (Beralu), Palyadasime and Morasu proper which is again divided into three lines called Salu viz. Kanu salu, Nerlegattada salu, Kutera salu. The Musuku sect is so-called because the bride wears a veil or 'Musuku' during the wedding ceremony. Namadhari Vokkaligas The Namadhari Vokkaliga group is the first largest Vokkaliga sub-group. Halakki Vokkaliga Halakki Vokkaligas are an indigenous tribe in of Uttar Kannada district. Taking cognisance of the tribe’s demands to be recognised as a Scheduled Tribe a study was commissioned by the social welfare department in 2010 and a report was submitted.

MAUP affects results when point-based measures of spatial phenomena are aggregated into districts, for example, population density or illness rates. The resulting summary values (e.g., totals, rates, proportions, densities) are influenced by both the shape and scale of the aggregation unit. For example, census data may be aggregated into county districts, census tracts, postcode areas, police precincts, or any other arbitrary spatial partition. Thus the results of data aggregation are dependent on the mapmaker's choice of which \\"modifiable areal unit\\" to use in their analysis. A census choropleth map calculating population density using state boundaries will yield radically different results than a map that calculates density based on county boundaries. Furthermore, census district boundaries are also subject to change over time, meaning the MAUP must be considered when comparing past data to current data.  Background  The issue was first recognized by Gehlke and Biehl in 1934 and later described in detail in a famous article by Openshaw (1984) and in the book by Arbia (1988). In particular, Openshaw (1984) observed that \\"the areal units (zonal objects) used in many geographical studies are arbitrary, modifiable, and subject to the whims and fancies of whoever is doing, or did, the aggregating\\". The problem is especially apparent when the aggregate data are used for cluster analysis for spatial epidemiology, spatial statistics or choropleth mapping, in which misinterpretations can easily be made without realizing it. Many fields of science, especially human geography are prone to disregard the MAUP when drawing inferences from statistics based on aggregated data. MAUP is closely related to the topic of ecological fallacy and ecological bias (Arbia, 1988). Ecological bias caused by MAUP has been documented as two separate effects that usually occur simultaneously during the analysis of aggregated data. First, the scale effect causes variation in statistical results between different levels of aggregation (radial distance). Therefore, the association between variables depends on the size of areal units for which data are reported. Generally, correlation increases as areal unit size increases. The zone effect describes variation in correlation statistics caused by the regrouping of data into different configurations at the same scale (areal shape). Since the 1930s, research has found extra variation in statistical results because of the MAUP. The standard methods of calculating within-group and between-group variance do not account for the extra variance seen in MAUP studies as the groupings change. MAUP can be used as a methodology to calculate upper and lower limits as well as average regression parameters for multiple sets of spatial groupings. The MAUP is a critical source of error in spatial studies, whether observational or experimental. As such, unit consistency, particularly in a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) context, is essential. Further, robustness checks of unit sensitivity to alternative spatial aggregation should be routinely performed to mitigate associated biases on resulting statistical estimates.  Suggested solutions  Several suggestions have been made in literature to reduce aggregation bias during regression analysis. A researcher might correct the variance-covariance matrix using samples from individual-level data.Holt D, Steel D, Tranmer M, Wrigley N. (1996). “Aggregation and ecological effects in geographically based data.” “Geographical Analysis” 28:244{261 Alternatively, one might focus on local spatial regression rather than global regression. A researcher might also attempt to design areal units to maximize a particular statistical result. Others have argued that it may be difficult to construct a single set of optimal aggregation units for multiple variables, each of which may exhibit non-stationarity and spatial autocorrelation across space in different ways. Others have suggested developing statistics that change across scales in a predictable way, perhaps using fractal dimension as a scale-independent measure of spatial relationships. Others have suggested Bayesian hierarchical models as a general methodology for combining aggregated and individual-level data for ecological inference. Studies of the MAUP based on empirical data can only provide limited insight due to an inability to control relationships between multiple spatial variables. Data simulation is necessary to have control over various properties of individual-level data. Simulation studies have demonstrated that the spatial support of variables can affect the magnitude of ecological bias caused by spatial data aggregation.  MAUP sensitivity analysis  Using simulations for univariate data, Larsen advocated the use of a Variance Ratio to investigate the effect of spatial configuration, spatial association, and data aggregation.Larsen, J. (2000). \\"The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem: A problem or a source of spatial information?\\" PhD thesis, Ohio State University. A detailed description of the variation of statistics due to MAUP is presented by Reynolds, who demonstrates the importance of the spatial arrangement and spatial autocorrelation of data values.Reynolds, H. (1998). \\"The Modifiable Area Unit Problem: Empirical Analysis By Statistical Simulation.\\" PhD thesis, Department of Geography University of Toronto, http://www.badpets.net/Thesis Reynold’s simulation experiments were expanded by Swift, who in which a series of nine exercises began with simulated regression analysis and spatial trend, then focused on the topic of MAUP in the context of spatial epidemiology. A method of MAUP sensitivity analysis is presented that demonstrates that the MAUP is not entirely a problem.Swift, A., Liu, L., and Uber, J. (2008) \\"Reducing MAUP bias of correlation statistics between water quality and GI illness.\\" Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 32, 134–148 MAUP can be used as an analytical tool to help understand spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. This topic is of particular importance because in some cases data aggregation can obscure a strong correlation between variables, making the relationship appear weak or even negative. Conversely, MAUP can cause random variables to appear as if there is a significant association where there is not. Multivariate regression parameters are more sensitive to MAUP than correlation coefficients. Until a more analytical solution to MAUP is discovered, spatial sensitivity analysis using a variety of areal units is recommended as a methodology to estimate the uncertainty of correlation and regression coefficients due to ecological bias. An example of data simulation and re- aggregation using the ArcPy library is available.Swift, A. (2017). \\"Crime mapping data simulation\\", https://app.box.com/s/a84w16x7hffljjvkhtlr72eisj4qiene In transport planning, MAUP is associated to Traffic Analysis Zoning (TAZ). A major point of departure in understanding problems in transportation analysis is the recognition that spatial analysis has some limitations associated with the discretization of space. Among them, modifiable areal units and boundary problems are directly or indirectly related to transportation planning and analysis through the design of traffic analysis zones – most of transport studies require directly or indirectly the definition of TAZs. The modifiable boundary and the scale issues should all be given specific attention during the specification of a TAZ because of the effects these factors exert on statistical and mathematical properties of spatial patterns (ie the modifiable areal unit problem—MAUP). In the studies of Viegas, Martinez and Silva (2009, 2009b) the authors propose a method where the results obtained from the study of spatial data are not independent of the scale, and the aggregation effects are implicit in the choice of zonal boundaries. The delineation of zonal boundaries of TAZs has a direct impact on the reality and accuracy of the results obtained from transportation forecasting models. In this paper the MAUP effects on the TAZ definition and the transportation demand models are measured and analyzed using different grids (in size and in origin location). This analysis was developed by building an application integrated in commercial GIS software and by using a case study (Lisbon Metropolitan Area) to test its implementabiity and performance. The results reveal the conflict between statistical and geographic precision, and their relationship with the loss of information in the traffic assignment step of the transportation planning models.

Pando shut down its servers and ceased business on August 31, 2013. As of February 24, 2014, the Pando Media Booster had been hijacked, and unsuspecting persons who installed a prompted update had their internet browsers hijacked, and a virus called the \\"Sweet Page\\" browser virus was installed on their machines. Details Pando functioned as a normal BitTorrent client and used the BitTorrent protocol to transfer files. Using Pando was very similar to using any BitTorrent client. A Pando upload began with meta-data stored within a file with a .pando filename extension. Also like BitTorrent, this file could be sent via e-mail or published on a website or exchanged with the recipient in some other way (such as via IM). And, like BitTorrent, the downloader had to first install the Pando software. Pando used a 256-bit end-to-end encryptionFrequently Asked Questions: Where do the files I send go? method to secure communication among peers. The primary difference from traditional BitTorrent file transfer operations was that a copy of the shared file was uploaded to Pando's servers and remained there for a limited time, seeding it. In this way, the file remained available even after the original sender went offline.

Its common features were: * Server-assisted delivery provided increased file availability and delivery speeds. (Subscribers received faster server-assisted speeds.) * Seven days, or thirty days, of file retention on Pando's servers, depending on how users shared. (Subscriptions doubled these retention times to fourteen days or sixty days.) * Statistics about number and time of downloads were provided to the sender. * It was fully supported client software for both the Windows and the Mac OS X operating systems. * An assortment of software could be added-on to popular web browsers, instant messaging, or e-mail clients. * Users were allowed an unlimited number of uploads. * The maximum file size that could be so transferred by non-subscribers was 1 GB; this was increased to 3 GB with subscriptions. Pando Media Booster The Pando Media Booster (PMB) was an application by Pando Networks that publishers of games and software could employ to ensure safe, complete and speedy downloads of large files. PMB was primarily used to download MMORPGs. Users of PMB participated in a secure, closed peer-to-peer network where users received pieces of the download package from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) as well as \\"peers, or other active users. PMB was usually packaged and automatically uploaded to a PC without the knowledge of the user. Many times, users would experience drastically slower downloads of these MMORPGs while PMB was being installed. Unlike Pando, PMB could not be used to send files from the user's computer. PMB was only activated to deliver Pando-enabled downloads from commercial sources such as TV networks, software publishers and gaming companies. Conflicts The Pando Media Booster (PMB.exe) listened on TCP ports 443 and 563. People who were having trouble getting web servers such as Apache, IIS, or others to work were advised to consider removing the Pando Media Booster. The Pando Media Booster ran at system startup and took priority to other downloads. Slower-than-normal downloading speeds or general network performance issues might be related to the product. These conflicts ceased to be reported in 2013, when Pando shut down its servers and ceased business.

Methane Princess was built at the Vickers shipyard at Barrow-in-Furnessand her sister by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. Design and construction In 1958 the tanker Methane Pioneer entered service, converted from a cargo ship for the sea transport of liquified natural gas (LNG), by a joint venture of Conoco and Union Stock Yards, funded by the British Gas Council, later joined by the Shell and renamed Conch International Methane. Following the successful proving of the technological and commercial viability by Methane Pioneer, two identical purpose-designed tankers were ordered by Conch to service a contract by British Gas to import LNG from Arzew, Algeria. One ship was ordered from Vickers-Armstrongs Shipbuilders at Barrow-in-Furness as Yard No.1071 and the other from Harland and Wolff in Belfast as Yard No.1653. Both ships were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and measured 21876 gross registered tons. Their cargo volume capacity was , divided between nine prismatic, or prism-shaped, tanks. Unlike the diesel- powered Methane Pioneer, the new ships were powered by a novel system with dual fuel steam turbines, utilising boil-off LNG from the cargo tanks as well as conventional fuel oil. The keel of Methane Princess was laid on 26 April 1962 and she was launched on 22 June 1963. The keel of Methane Progress was laid on 24 September 1962 and she was launched on 19 September 1963. Commercial operation Although Methane Progress was completed first, on 26 May 1964, it was Methane Princess (completed 21 June) that took on the first load of natural gas at Arzew, Algeria when the liquefaction plant was opened on 27 September, and arrived at the Gas Council's terminal at Canvey island, Essex on 12 October. The two ships could transport 700,000 tons of liquified gas per year, then estimated as 10 per cent of Britain's gas consumption.

In the American Revolution, New Bridge Landing was the site of a strategic bridge crossing the Hackensack River, where General George Washington led his troops in retreat from British forces November 20, 1776. Eleven engagements took place here throughout the war. The current Draw Bridge at New Bridge was installed in 1889 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 5, 1989. The area is now a New Jersey historic site in portions of New Milford, River Edge, Hackensack and Teaneck in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States.  History  New Bridge was settled by the Bergen Dutch, an agricultural community whose language and culture blended contributions from Dutch, Angolan African, German, English, French, Scotch and Scandinavian settlers. At a place known originally as Aschatking (where the river narrows), about ten miles above the head of Newark Bay, a Swedish land-clearer named Cornelius Mattyse acquired 420 acres at the juncture of Tantaqua's Creek (Cole's Brook) and the Hackensack River, in 1682. This was called Tantaqua's Plain, where a Hackensack sachem of that name resided with his kinfolk. David Ackerman, residing in the village of Hackensack, purchased the land from Matheus Corneliuson, son of Cornelius Matheus of Hackinsack River, in 1695. He devised that portion of this tract of land lying east of Kinderkamack Road to his son, Johannes Ackerman, who built a dwelling on the Steenrapie (Kinderkamack) Road at the time of his marriage to Jannetje Lozier in 1713. A tidal gristmill was built on the Hackensack River. This mill got its power from an artificial pond: the high tide was trapped in the mouth of Cole's Brook by a dam with a special drop-gate, suspended from a horizontal timber. When the tides flowed out of the Hackensack River, the tidal millpond was slowly released through the waterwheel. Sloops pulled alongside the mill at New Bridge Landing. On March 9, 1744, a road was surveyed from Kinderkamack Road to the narrows of the Hackensack River where a \\"New Bridge\\" was to be erected (forming was is now Main Street, River Edge). Jan and Annetje (Ackerman) Zabriskie purchased the Johannes Ackerman mill and farm in September 1745, shortly after construction of the first draw-bridge at the narrows of the Hackensack River. This wooden span was called New Bridge to distinguish it from an older crossing 1-1/2 miles upstream at Old Bridge. In 1752, Jan Zabriskie built the oldest part of the Steuben House. The Zabriskies grew wealthy from increased trade brought on by the French and Indian War (1756-1763). New Bridge Landing was the business center of the upper Hackensack Valley - the shopping mall of its day. Iron made in stone furnaces along the Ramapo Mountains was carried in ox-carts to New Bridge Landing where it was loaded onto boats for shipment to market. Flour and animal feed was shipped from the mill. All kinds of wares came in from boats returning from the city. This location had an added advantage: because of the wide Hackensack Meadowlands downstream, New Bridge remained the nearest river crossing to Newark Bay until 1790. Overland traffic including farm wagons and stage coaches, going to and from New York City, crossed the river at this spot on their way into the interior parts of the country.Bergen County Historical Society  The Great Retreat  After losses in the Battle of Brooklyn, General George Washington led his troops towards Manhattan, with the British in pursuit. On November 16, 1776, Fort Washington in Upper Manhattan fell to the British, and Washington evacuated Fort Lee on the other side the North River (Hudson River). the Palisades on the morning of November 20, 1776, near Fort Lee, New Jersey. In the early morning hours of November 20, 1776, Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led a British and Hessian army of about 2,500 soldiers across the Hudson to New Dock into New Jersey for an attack against Fort Lee, then defended by about 2,700 soldiers. Washington met Greene to lead his troops in a retreat through present-day Fort Lee, Englewood and Teaneck across the Hackensack River at New Bridge. The hasty withdrawal of the American garrison across the Hackensack River at New Bridge preserved them from entrapment on the Bergen Neck, the narrow piece of land between the Hudson and Hackensack Rivers. They continued westward, crossing the Passaic River on the Acquakanonk Bridge, which was dismantled.

He continued his retreat through early December, passing through Princeton and Trenton on the way towards and across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. According to tradition, Thomas Paine composed the first tract of The American Crisis - a series of essays intended to rally American resolve during the darkest hours of the war - at Newark using a drumhead for a desk and a campfire for illumination. Published on December 19, 1776, only six days before Washington's victory at Trenton reversed the declining fortunes of the Continental cause, Paine stirred hopes with his immortal refrain.

The British failure to capture the American garrison at Fort Lee, and perhaps defeat the American rebellion, was a consequence of self-confident British officers not realizing, despite reminders from local Loyalists, that \\"New Bridge was the key to the peninsula between the Hackensack and the Hudson.\\" While a constant arena for conflict, the following significant Revolutionary War events are associated with New Bridge:Bergen County Historical Society https://www.bergencountyhistory.org/newbridge-revwar * British troops under Major General Vaughan attacked the American rear guard on November 21, 1776 and seized the New Bridge, which American engineers were dismantling. * British and Loyalist troops under command of Captain Patrick Fergusen attacked about 40 Bergen militiamen at New Bridge on May 18, 1779. * Major Henry Lee led American troops from New Bridge on August 18, 1779, to attack the British earthworks at Paulus Hook. * A force of Bergen Militia and Continental troops attacked 600 British troops and German auxiliaries at New Bridge on their retreat from Hackensack and Paramus on March 23, 1780, during the two hours it took for the British to repair and cross the New Bridge. * A body of 312 British, Loyalist and German infantry, attacked and overwhelmed an American outpost at New Bridge commanded by Lieutenant Bryson on April 15, 1780. * Eight British soldiers were killed and several wounded, by friendly fire when British troops attempted to attack a body of Bergen Militia in the Zabriskie- Steuben House at New Bridge on May 30, 1780. * Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led American troops from New Bridge on a raid against the blockhouse at Bull's Ferry on July 20, 1780. * General Washington made his headquarters in the Zabriskie-Steuben House during the Steenrapie encampment of the Continental Army, encompassing nearly 14,000 men, on September 4–20, 1780.  Historic Homes  The Steuben House pictured in 1936. On December 23, 1783, in gratitude for his service to the Continental Army, the State of New Jersey presented use of a house, mill and the surrounding areas to Major-General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. The house had been confiscated from Jan Zabriskie, a Loyalist, in 1781. This gift was one of many grants of land von Steuben received from several states in thanks for his efforts in training the Continental Army. This estate is considered to be the most valuable and is now known as the Steuben House. The Steuben House Commission was created in 1926 to purchase Baron Steuben's home at New Bridge. The State of New Jersey took possession of the historic mansion and of ground for $9,000 on June 27, 1928. The Steuben House was renovated and opened as a public museum in September 1939 displaying period artifacts belonging to the Bergen County Historical Society. The Bergen County was invited to make its headquarters at the Steuben House at that time. The Steuben House, listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places, is under the jurisdiction of the Historic New Bridge Landing Park Commission. The Steuben House is a state-historic site. The Historic New Bridge Landing Park Commission was established by legislation (P. L. 1995, Chapter 260, powers expanded by P. L. 2009, Chapter 45) to coordinate and implement governmental and private development policies and other activities incidental to the preservation, maintenance, restoration and interpretation of the historic riverfront village surrounding New Bridge, so as to optimize its educational and recreational benefit to the public. Since this historic neighborhood spans the Hackensack River at the intersection of four municipalities (namely, River Edge, New Milford, Teaneck, and Hackensack), the Commission provides an intercommunicative forum to inform and coordinate decisions made by diverse public and private entities having ownership of properties within the Commission's jurisdiction. The Bergen County Historical Society, non-profit volunteer organization, is a member and lead force of the commission, is the largest landowner and volunteers provide all programming. The house is now the cornerstone of a historic site. Other threatened historic homes, including the Campbell-Christie House and the Demarest House Museum were moved from New Milford and the Westervelt-Thomas Barn, from Washington Township, have been relocated onto BCHS property for preservation. BCHS constructed a working out-kitchen.

Sarria is the most populous town on the French Way in Galicia, with 13,700 inhabitants. It is head of the region and the most popular starting point for the Camino de Santiago; many pilgrims choose Sarria because the distance from this point to Santiago allows them to cover the necessary kilometers to reach the Compostela. King Alfonso IX of León died in Sarria in 1230 while making a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Artistic heritage Sarria's artistic heritage is primarily characterized by churches, which are essential to the Way of St. James. This includes the early-Gothic, 13th-century church, O Salvador, which is located on Rúa Maior. In this town, from its unusual rúa Maior, it is possible to see the only tower that remains of the medieval fortress belonging to the town called Fortress of Sarria. Around this tower, a fair is held three times a month to showcase the traditional products of the area. From its medieval past, Sarria conserves the Convent of A Madalena, currently belonging to the Mercedarian Fathers, founded at the beginning of the 13th century as a pilgrim hospital by Italian monks of the Order of the Blessed Martyrs of Jesus, who were also pilgrims. The present building, which houses a small cloister and a church, is a mixture of different styles of construction ranging from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Today, it is also a private school. Sarria stands out in the Camino de Santiago for being the population centre with the largest offering of services. It has a strategic point of view of its connections; it is accessible through railway and road, being especially important the 546 road the connects Lugo and Monforte, direction Ponferrada. Leisure activities  The township of Sarria offers a number of leisure activities to visitors, such as O Chanto recreational site, on the banks of the river Sarria. There are also options for fishing at several preserves along the river Sarria, hunting, trekking or taking horseback rides. The village's gastronomy includes dishes like the local stew (cocido), made primarily of pork, octopus, pasty and wild game, partridge, boar and hare. Other local foods include the blood crepes of milk and egg freixos, served with cream or honey. The economy of this Galician town is based on cattle farming and industry, especially the production of furniture. However, the importance of tourism in Sarria in increasing, mostly due to its cultural heritage, landscapes and food. The most popular festivities in Sarria are the feast of St. John, which is the patron saint festival, and Corpus Christi, during which a procession takes place. The Noite Meiga (Witch's Night) is held the last Saturday of August. Gallery Image:Ponte da aspera.JPGPonte de Áspera - romanic style bridge from 12th century.

He contributed to the construction of Vidhana Soudha, the seat of the state legislature.  Early life  Kengal Hanumanthaiah was born on February 14, 1908 in a Vokkaliga family in a Lakkappanahalli, a small village near Ramanagara, Ramanagara District. He graduated in Arts from the Maharaja College in Mysore in 1930 and later earned a degree in Law from Poona Law College in 1932. During his college days, he was elected as the Secretary of the Students Union and the Karnataka Sangha. After his graduation, he joined the bar council in the same year.  Political career  At that time, the independence movement was steadily growing and at the center stage of the movement was the Indian National Congress led by Mahatma Gandhi. Dr. P. Tandon, the then President of Indian National Congress, advised Hanumanthaiah to give up his active practice at the bar and to devote himself to the freedom struggle. With the inspiration of Gandhiji and the persuasion of Tandon, Hanumanthaiah joined the freedom movement and became active in the then Mysore Congress. During the movement, he was jailed more than 7 times. He was unanimously elected as the leader of the Parliamentary Party wing of the Congress Party in Mysore Assembly in the year 1948. Also, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India. He became the second Chief minister of Mysore state in 1952, following the victory of the Congress party in the 1st general elections. His tenure as Chief Minister was marked by activities aimed at uplifting the rural population of the state and promoting economic growth. Hanumanthaiah's major achievement was the construction of the \\"Vidhana Soudha\\", the largest legislature-cum-office building in India at that time. His other key achievement was the Unification of Karnataka. He played a role in uniting the Kannada speaking areas within the boundaries of a single state.  Role in Constituent Assembly  He was part of the Committee for the Drafting of a Model Constitution for the Indian States and made interventions on the issue of federalism . In the Constituent Assembly, he argued for greater autonomy for states. Vidhana Soudha Hanumanthaiah played a key role in the construction of the Vidhan Soudha, the seat of Karnataka's legislature. During an interview, Kengal Hanumanthaiah explained the reasoning behind the construction of a grand legislature building. A Russian cultural delegation was visiting Bangalore and Hanumanthaiah took them around to show the city. Stung by their comments, Hanumanthaiah vowed to create a monument so magnificent that it would showcase the best of Karnataka's indigenous architectural style. This resulted in the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of Legislature in Karnataka. Later life After resigning as Chief Minister shortly before the Unification of Karnataka in 1956, he moved on to national politics. He was continuously elected as a member of parliament representing Bangalore city from 1962 to 1977. He was member of the 3rd(1962), 4th(1967) and 5th(1971) Loksabha . During this period he served as minister in the Union cabinet handling a number of portfolio's such as Railways, Industries etc. In the 1971 elections, he defeated the poet Gopalkrishna Adiga, who was a candidate of the Jana Sangh. However, he lost to Justice K. S. Hegde of the Janata party in 1977. He died on 1 December 1980.

Their interests were football, cricket and track. Within a year the club acquired an old velodrome in Donnerschwee – part of the town of Oldenburg today – and converted it to a football ground. The club played for two seasons in the Gauliga Weser-Ems (I), just before the end of the war, from 1942 to 1944. After again restoring their ground in the aftermath of World War II, the club was able to pick up play in the Oberliga Nord in the 1949–50 season, but immediately found themselves relegated to tier II. They made another single season appearance in the upper league in 1955–56, before returning for a run of three seasons from 1960 to 1963 in the lead up to the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional football league. Oldenburg did not qualify for the new circuit and found themselves in the Regionalliga Nord (II). They played at that level until the mid-1970s when they slipped into the Amateur Oberliga Nord (III). They enjoyed their highest league finish in 1991–92. They finished bottom of the third level in 1999–2000, and came close to being dissolved due to financial problems.

History  The institute was opened in Tbilisi, Georgia in 1923, and was a bacteriology laboratory. Its founder, Prof. George Eliava, was not aware of bacteriophages until 1919-1921. In those years he met Felix d'Herelle during a visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris. There, Eliava was enthusiastic about the potential of phages in the curing of bacterial disease, and invited d'Herelle to visit his laboratory in Georgia. D'Herelle visited Tbilisi twice in 1933-34, and agreed to work with Prof. Eliava. It has been suggested that d'Herelle became enamored of the communist idea. In 1934, Joseph Stalin invited d'Herelle to the institute in Tbilisi; he accepted and worked there for about 18 months. D'Herelle dedicated one of his books to Stalin, The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Cure, written and published in Tbilisi in 1935. However, the collaboration between the two scientists was not to be. Around the time d'Herelle was to take up residence, in 1937 George Eliava was executed and denounced as an enemy of the people.Anna Kuchment: The Forgotten Cure. New York 2012, p. 32–33 D'Herelle returned to France. He never was allowed to come back to Georgia by the Soviets. D'Herelle's book was also banned from distribution. In spite of this development, the institute did not change its practical specialization, and continued its activity in the field of bacteriophage research. In 1938, the Institute of Bacteriophage Research and the Institute of Microbiology & Epidemiology (founded separately in 1936) merged, and the Institute of Microbiology, Epidemiology and Bacteriophage was formed. It existed until 1951 and was authorized by the People's Commissary of Health of Georgia. After 1951, it came under the auspices of the All-Union Ministry of Health and was renamed The Institute of Vaccine and Sera.samegrelo.geguchadze.com Since its inception, the institute was composed of a combination of industrial and scientific (research) departments. In 1988 the Institute was rearranged again and emerged as the Scientific Industrial Union \\"Bacteriophage\\" (SIU \\"Bacteriophage\\"). Around that time, its scientific portion was renamed the George Eliava Research Institute of Bacteriophage. Based on the original intentions of D'Herelle and Eliava, the Bacteriophage Institute retained its leadership among other institutes of similar profile over the years. Teimuraz Chanishvili was the leader of the scientific part of the institute for over 30 years, until his death in August 2007.  The institute behind the Iron Curtain  The institute in Tbilisi became a general Soviet institute for the development and production of bacteriophage drugs. Patients with serious infectious diseases came from all over the Soviet Union to receive treatments there. Bacteriophages became a routine part of treatment in clinics and hospitals. Ointments for the skin, and pills, drops, and rinses consisting of phages were sold and are still sold at pharmacies throughout Eastern Europe at low prices.Richard Stone: Bacteriophage Therapy: Stalin's Forgotten Cure. Science 298(5594) (2002) 728-31 After the Republic of Georgia declined to join the Russian Federation and the Georgian Civil War broke out in 1991, the Tbilisi facility was essentially ruined. The Eliava Institute's facilities were damaged and decades of research on bacteriophage nearly went down the drain. Thousands of bacteriophage samples identified over the years and catalogued in huge, refrigerated \\"libraries\\" suffered irreversible damage due to frequent electrical outages. Apparently, the Russians transferred some of the equipment to their territory and built plants for the production of bacteriophages in other locations. Clearly, they recognized the importance of the research and also that of continued bacteriophage therapy. The situation at the Eliava Institute continued to deteriorate until it was on the verge of closure. However, in 1997, a report on the institute was broadcast by the BBC, sparking a flurry of media interest in the West. The headlines drew doctors and scientists to Tbilisi - and also, most importantly, energetic entrepreneurs from around the world who were determined to help save the institute and its stocks and fully explore the potential of this \\"new\\" and highly effective therapy. Georgian scientists whose names were connected in some way to the institute saw great opportunity, and some of them emigrated to the West to be part of joint projects.

She is accompanied by two geese and holds a vase in hand. Two streams of water and fish emerging from the vessel. Two six- pointed stars and two solar discs are behind the goddess (plate Terracotta). Third Dynasty of Ur. In Sumerian mythology, Nanshe ( ) was a goddess, the daughter of Enki (god of wisdom, magic and water) and Ninhursag (earth and mother goddess). Her functions as a goddess were varied. She was a goddess of social justice, prophecy, fertility and fishing. Like her father, she was heavily associated with water. She held dominion over the Persian Gulf and all the animals within. Her seat of power was the Sirara temple, located in the city of Lagash. Her consort was Nindara.

The British Museum, London Terracotta plaque showing seated goddess Nanshe and geese. from southern Iraq. 2003-1595 BCE. Iraq Museum Mythology=Birth of Nanshe Nanshe's birth is described in the Sumerian myth 'Enki and Ninhursag.' In the tale, Enki consumes several forbidden plants under the protection of his wife. In retaliation, Ninhursag places a curse on him. Enki soon becomes crippled with ailments, and the gods are left helpless. Enlil, the powerful sky god, manages to ease Ninhursag's anger after sending a fox, a sacred animal of Ninhursag, to speak with her. She then returns to Enki's side and lifts the curse. To heal Enki, Ninhursag gives birth to several healing gods. Nanshe was meant to heal her father's neck. At the conclusion of the myth, she is betrothed to the god Nindara. The World Order Nanshe's father, Enki, was later tasked with organizing the world and assigning every god a function. Nanshe was assigned dominion over the Persian Gulf, on which floated her father's awe inspiring sea shrine. As a secondary function, she was to ensure that shipments of fish reached the mainland. When heading onto the mainland, she sailed by barge from the Gulf. She had a strong connection with wildlife, especially birds and bats. In one hymn, she converses with ravens and pelicans, among other species. The Goddess of Social Justice During the time of Gudea (2144 - 2124 BCE), many hymns to Nanshe appeared showing her in an elevated position in the pantheon. She was the widely worshiped goddess of social justice. She nurtured orphans, provided for widows, gave advice to those in debt, and took in refugees from war torn areas.Heimple, W. \\"The Nanse Hymn\\" Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 33, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 65-139 Several other gods appeared to be under the command of Nanshe. Hendursag and Haia were her assistants. Nisaba, sometimes portrayed as Nanshe's sister, was her chief scribe. On the first day of the new year, a festival was held at her temple. People came from all over the land to seek her wisdom and aid. Visitors were cleansed in the river of ordeals and then, if worthy, given an audience with the goddess. Nanshe settled disputes and handled court cases amongst mortals. Holding a higher ranking in the pantheon during this era, Nanshe sometimes shared the same tasks as Utu, the traditional god of justice. She sat on the holy thrones with the other prominent gods, and was seen as a goddess of protection. At one point, Ninurta, the mighty god of war, turns to her for guidance. The Goddess of Prophecy Nanshe had the ability to give oracular messages and determine the future through dream interpretation (Oneiromancy). Her priests were also granted these abilities after conducting a ritual that represented death and resurrection. Despite the ritual, Nanshe is not depicted as life-death-rebirth deity in any known hymns or myths. The Guarantor of Boundaries - The Lady of the Storerooms In the Nanše Hymn she is described as having a role seeing that weights and measures are correct.Black, Jeremy; Anthony Green, Tessa Rickards Gods, demons, and symbols of ancient Mesopotamia University of Texas Press (Aug 1992) p.135 > 223-231: The guarantor of boundaries, the expert in (?) righteous words, > lady, wise woman who founded Lagac ... with Jatumdug. ... righteous words > for (?)

Metropolitan Museum of Art 1996.353 The Nanše Hymn attributes to Nanshe, in her role as a protective goddess, special concern for vulnerable members of society: > 20-31 She is concerned for the orphan and concerned for the widow. She does > not forget the man who helps (?) others, she is a mother for the orphan; > Nance, a carer for the widow, who always finds advice for the debt-slave; > the lady who gives protection for refugees.

She is also -- perhaps due to her role as Lady of the Storeroom and its associated aspects of fertility and bounty -- associated with beer mash, yeast, and honey: > 10-19 She is beer mash (?), the mother is yeast (?), Nance is the cause of > great things: her presence makes the storehouses of the land bulge (1 ms. > has instead: prosper) and makes the honey ... like resin in the storerooms. > Because of her, there stand vessels with ever-flowing water; because of > Nance, the baskets containing the treasures of the Land cover the ground > like the silt of the river.

The pelican, said in folklore to rip open its own chest to feed its young, represents her role as a protector and caregiver.

It has developed over time with local culture and agriculture and hence has its distinct items and practices. Odisha borders both north Indian states and south Indian states and consequently is similar to the cuisines of South and North India. Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy while nonetheless remaining flavourful. Rice is the staple food of this region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples. In old times food was traditionally served on banana leaves or disposable plates made of sal leaves. Odia cooks, particularly from the Puri region, were much sought after due to their ability to cook food in accordance with Hindu scriptures. During the 19th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengal and they took many Odia dishes with them. This period also saw a heavy demand for Brahmin cooks, leading many Odia cooks to fake their castes. Yoghurt is used in dishes. Many sweets of the region are based on chhena (cheese). Ingredients and seasoning Rice is a major crop of Odisha bhumin is the best..https://archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/state_uts.php?id=77 Lentils such as pigeon peas and nung beans are another major ingredients. Indigenous vegetables used in Odia cuisine are Pumpkin, Gourd , plantains, jackfruit, and papaya. Recently introduced vegetables such as chillies, potatoes, cauliflower, and cabbage are also used alongside local vegetables. The curries are garnished with dried raw mango (ambula). Panchaw phutana is a blend of five spices that is widely used in Odia cuisine. It contains mustard, cumin, fenugreek, aniseed and kalonji. Garlic, onion and ginger are used in most of the food. Temple food preparation doesn't allow the use of garlic or onion. Turmeric and red chillies are used regularly Local variation The food in the region around Puri-Cuttack is greatly influenced by the Jagannath Temple. On the other hand, kalonji and mustard paste are used mostly in the region bordering Bengal and curries tend to be sweeter. In the region closer to Andhra Pradesh, curry tree leaves and tamarind are used more. The Brahmapur region has influences of South Indian cuisine and the Telugu people living there have invented new Odia dishes. Temple food Abadha, the afternoon meal of the Jagannath Temple served on a plantain leaf. Temples in the region make offerings to the presiding deities. The prasada of the Jagannath Temple is well known and is specifically called Maha Prasad meaning greatest of all prasadas. It consists of 56 recipes, so it is called . It is based on the legend that Krishna missed his eight meals for seven days while trying to save a village from a storm holding up the Govardhan hill as a shelter.

It primarily consisted of the medieval fort of Gotalovec (dated 1322), and the surrounding villages. It was in the possession of the Gotal family until 1740 when it was transferred by inheritance to the Somogy and later on the Bedekovic Komorski family. Finally, in the late 18th century it was incorporated by the noble Erdody family into their estate. In the nearby locality of Gotalovec, no trace of the former fort or later castle can presently be found as the remains of the latter were used as building material during construction of a nearby road. It is known however that the fort was situated some 100 to 200 cmeters from one of the source of the river Krapina; in 1988, one could clearly distinguish three levels under an orchard and an access through a hole in a bush which was no more accessible in 2002. Old people sead it gave access to a large room (some sort of wardroom) they visited as children. The 1500 castle was located westward from the fort. Modern Gotalovec is a peaceful and quite village. Nowadays it is famous for the spring of Bistra water which is located nearby Gotalovec in the foothills of the Ivanscica hill. Gotalovec is inhabited by friendly and hospitable people. It is well known for its distinguished Hladika family. The Hladikas of Gotalovec are hosts of the annual party taking place in late August every year when family, friends and people from nearby localities seize the opportunity to relax over a cup of home-made 'Viljamovka' (alcoholic drink made of Williams pears), a glass of good wine and barbecue. The Hladika family is also an up-and-coming manufacturer of this drink. Gotalovec is also known for its natural beauties, its swimming pools and mild climate.

She was worshiped in shrines and sanctuaries at Umma and Ereš, and was often praised by Sumerian scribes. She is considered the patroness of mortal scribes as well as the scribe of the gods. In the Babylonian period, her worship was mainly redirected towards the god Nabu, who took over her functions. Name Nisaba's name was originally written using a combination of the cuneiform sign , called NAGA, and the dingir, , representing divinity. The NAGA sign is a pictogram representing a stalk of wheat, denoting her as the divinity present within grains. Although the sign NAGA is sometimes read as Nidaba, Jeremy Black points out that \\"the name Nisaba (or Nissaba) seems more correct than Nidaba\\".Mark, Joshua J. \\"Nisaba\\", Ancient History Encyclopedia. 23 January 2017. Accessed online at https://www.ancient.eu/Nisaba/ She is also known by the epithet Nanibgal ( ; later ), and may have been the same goddess as Nunbarsegunu.Monaghan, Patricia. 2010. Goddesses in World Culture, ABC-CLIO. Iconography and worship A goddess who may be Nisaba depicted on a fragment of a chlorite vase. c. 2430 BC. Pergamon Museum, Berlin. Stele Ur-Nanshe from Lagash. The goddess Nisaba appears on the frontal aspect. 26th century BCE. Iraq Museum, Baghdad Nisaba's worship began in the city of Umma, where she was originally a grain goddess during Early Dynastic Period I, c. 2900–2700 BC. As a grain goddess, she was represented by the symbol of a single stalk of grain. A fragment from a stone vase, probably found in Girsu and held in the British Museum, shows a goddess usually identified as Nisaba (though it could depict Baba or Inanna). She is depicted with four long curled tresses of hair crowned with a horned headdress supporting ears of wheat and a crescent moon, and holds a bunch of dates.Maxwell-Hyslop, K. (1992). The Goddess Nanše an Attempt to Identify Her Representation. Iraq, 54, 79-82. doi:10.2307/4200355 After she became recognized as a goddess of writing, she was described on the Gudea cylinders (c. 2125 BC) as holding a gold stylus and a clay tablet carrying the image of starry heaven.Kramer, S.N. 1971. The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character. University of Chicago Press. Nisaba's transition from being strictly a grain goddess to one also worshiped as patroness of writing and accounting probably took place as modes of writing became more and more important for documenting the buying and selling of grain and other staple goods. Cuneiform writing itself was seen as a gift handed down from the goddess.Shlain, L. (1999). The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The conflict between word and image. Penguin. As writing itself moved from a simple accounting shorthand to documenting contracts, laws, history, and literature, Nisaba's worship grew to include these functions. Her worship spread to Ereš, which housed a shrine to her and other deities in the temple, though she does not seem to have had any temples dedicated solely to her worship. Worship seems to have been conducted primarily via the art of writing, and each composition was seen as a gift for the goddess. Many clay-tablets end with the phrase “Nisaba be praised” ( ; Dnisaba za3-mi2) to honor her. A Hymn to Nisaba composed during the Second Dynasty of Ur begins, \\"Lady colored like the stars of heaven, holding a lapis lazuli tablet! Nisaba, great wild cow born of Uras, wild sheep nourished on good milk among holy alkaline plants, opening the mouth for seven reeds! Perfectly endowed with fifty great divine powers, my lady, most powerful.\\"Black, Literature, 293 Nisaba's worship seems to have declined during the Babylonian period and the reign of Hammurabi in the 18th century BC, during which time goddesses were de-emphasized in favor of gods. By end of the Third Dynasty of Ur, her worship seems to have been mostly replaced by that of Nabu, the male god of writing, who in some sources had Nisaba as his wife, though she continued to be revered alongside him in his temples for millennia. She continued to be counted alongside Nabu in lists of the gods of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and their widespread veneration protected them from some of the religious persecution that came with new regimes. However, while the cult of Nabu spread as far as the Mediterranean during the first few centuries AD, worship of Nisaba seems to have remained within Mesopotamia, where it seems to have died out following the fall of the Seleucid Empire in 63 BC, the last period during which she is attested in historical records. This saw Nisaba fall into obscurity and lose influence, her remaining forms of worship likely being suppressed as Christianity spread. Mythology=Role Nisaba serves as the scribe of the gods in Sumerian and later Mesopotamian mythology. The god of wisdom, Enki, who organized the world after creation, gave each deity a role in the world order. He named Nisaba the scribe of the gods, and Enki then built her a school of learning so that she could better serve those in need. She keeps records, chronicles events, and performs various other bookwork-related duties for the gods. She is also in charge of marking regional borders. Some pieces of writing, such as the Kesh Temple Hymn (one of the oldest surviving pieces of literature in the world), were said to have been spoken by the gods and recorded by Nisaba herself.Alster, B. (1976). On the Earliest Sumerian Literary Tradition. Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 28(2), 109-126. doi:10.2307/1359501 She is the chief scribe of Nanshe. On the first day of the new year, she and Nanshe work together to settle disputes between mortals and give aid to those in need. Nisaba keeps a record of the visitors seeking aid and then arranges them into a line to stand before Nanshe, who will then judge them. Nisaba is also seen as a caretaker for Ninhursag's temple at Kesh, where she gives commands and keeps temple records. Family As with many Sumerian deities, Nisaba's exact place in the pantheon and her heritage appears somewhat ambiguous. In the tradition of her original center of worship at Umma, she is held to be the daughter of An and Urash,From Sumerian texts, the language used to describe Urash is very similar to the language used to describe Ninhursag. Therefore, the two goddess may be one and the same. If Urash and Ninhursag are the same goddess, then Nisaba is also the half sister of Nanshe and (in some versions) Ninurta. and the sister of Ninsun, the mother of Gilgamesh. In the Eresh tradition, she is said to be the daughter of Enlil and Ninlil. In still other sources, she is considered the mother of Ninlil, and by extension, the mother- in-law of Enlil. Sources beginning in the First Babylonian dynasty (c. 1830 BC – c. 1531 BC) assign Nisaba a husband, named Ḫaya, who is described primarily as a god of scribes, though Ḫaya seems to have originally been little more than a masculine \\"reflection\\" of Nisaba.Glassman, R. M. (2017). The Status and Role of Women in Ancient Sumer. In The Origins of Democracy in Tribes, City- States and Nation-States (pp. 325-347). Springer, Cham.

History  Erdödy Castle in Jastrebarsko, originally built by Croatian ban Matija Gereb.  Antiquity  In 1865, remnants of a Roman settlement were uncovered in Repišće, Klinča Sela, a village in Jastrebarsko metropolitan area. Further archeological investigation in the late 20th century classified them as a villa rustica and a necropolis consisting of six tumuli, both dating to the early Roman Empire period. The remnants are deemed to be the westernmost group of Noric-Pannonian tumuli and they make a very rare occasion of tombstones located directly on top of tumuli, which is in the rest of Croatia recorded only in Donji Čehi. The location of this archeological site on the fluvial terraces of the local Konjava stream is attributed to the peaceful state of the central Roman Empire, which in turn led to formation of settlements in river valleys. PDF, 121 KB Sveta Marija pod Okićem () (locally nicknamed Grič), an archeological site located some north of Repišće dating to 4th century, shows a migration from easily accessible locations to steeper hills and creation of isolated walled refugia. This is attributed to the loss of stability in the Pannonian region and in the Empire overall. A necropolis belonging to Sveta Marija was found on the small valley of Popov Dol and small items were excavated therefrom. Those were mostly bronze bracelets and glass chalices, items that Romans buried with their deceased. Two similar sites were found in the vicinity: Pavlovčani and Plešivica pass.  Modern settlement  The name Jastrebarsko is derived from , the Croatian word for 'hawk' or 'falcon'. This can be attributed to the practicers of falconry (, pl. ), who were active in the area of southwest Zagreb County. A remnant of falconry can also be found in the Jastrebarsko coat of arms, which features a yellow goshawk on a blue blackground. The first mention of this name is found in a 1249 document of the Croatian ban Stjepan Gutkeled as \\"lands of Jastraburcza\\" (). The town is therein described as a trade and judicial center. In 1257 Croato-Hungarian King Bela IV awarded Jastrebarsko the status of a \\"free royal trading center\\" () by the means of a golden bull. This status helped Jastrebarsko combat the interests of local feudal lords until the abolishment of the feudal system by ban Josip Jelačić in 1848. From 1518 to 1848 Jastrebarsko is heavily influenced by the Croato- Hungarian noble family Erdödy. The bans Petar II and Toma II Erdödy were known for their victories against the spreading Ottoman Empire. Toma, son of Petar, won the 1593 Battle of Sisak, a major and decisive battle in the Ottomans' centuries-long occupation of Balkans. Later, in 1809 during the expansion of Napoleon's First French Empire, Jastrebarsko was for a short time incorporated in the Illyrian Provinces. This lasted until Summer 1813, when the French retreated from Croatia. Jastrebarsko started to rapidly develop following the 1848 abolishment of feudalism. The Zagreb-Karlovac railway was built in 1865, providing the town with a major source of employment. The local elementary school, founded in the 17th century, was augmented by a number of other cultural, social and sports organization, including a library, the singing society \\"Javor\\", association of tamburica players, a volunteer fire brigade and a theater and others. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Jastrebarsko was a district capital in the Zagreb County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. The town was the site of a concentration camp for Serb children operated by the authorities of the Independent State of Croatia during World War II.http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7384 This was the only concentration camp during World War II that was opened for children only.  Geography  Jastrebarsko is located in the Prigorje region of Central Croatia, built around the Reka Creek (; reka is Kajkavian dialect word for river). On the west, Jastrebarsko is bordered by the Žumberak Mountain (), a mountain range spreading through southeast Slovenia and southwest Prigorje, specifically Žumberak municipality and City of Samobor. The average altitude of the city is and the highest elevation in the Jastrebarsko metropolitan area is recorded on the Sveta Gera summit of the Žumberak mountain, also claimed by Slovenia.  Transport  Jastrebarsko lies on both Zagreb-Split (Adriatic-Ionian highway) and Zagreb-Rijeka (Corridor Vb) rail and road corridors. There is a highway exit near Jastrebarsko on the A1 highway, located between the Lučko interchange near Zagreb and the Karlovac interchange. This stretch is the oldest modern highway in Croatia, dating back to 1970. The Zagreb-Karlovac-Rijeka magistral railroad M202, part of the Pan- European corridor Vb, passes through Jastrebarsko. Jastrebarsko is served by a high-speed tilting train running between Zagreb and Rijeka and commuter trains operating between the town and Zagreb. The city administration has called for a traffic study in 2007 by Ivan Dadić, a Croatian traffic expert, to solve the transport problems riddling Jastrebarsko's roads. Preliminary opinion by Dadić called for construction of four additional interchanges on the Zagreb-Karlovac stretch that would stop Jastrebarsko from being the bottleneck exit for all commuters living on the A1 corridor.  Climate  The climate of Jastrebarsko is classified as maritime temperate with a slightly drier winter (Cfwbx in Köppen climate classification system). The city experiences four separate seasons. Winters are mild and summers are cool and the dry season spans through the winter and early spring. The average January low is around , while the July high tends to be near .

Aloysius Stepinac () was born in Krašić municipality in Jastrebarsko metropolitan area and made Archbishop of Zagreb in 1937 and later cardinal in 1952. He is recognized for trying to protect the Jews, Serbs, Romani people and other minorities in Croatia from the Nazi regime during the World War II-era Croatian puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia. However, after World War II and takeover by Yugoslav communists, Stepinac was sentenced in 1946 by a Yugoslav court to 16 years in prison for alleged collaborating with Nazis. He was released five years later and died in home confinement. He was buried in the Zagreb Cathedral and Franjo Šeper succeeded him as the new Archbishop of Zagreb. The other cardinal was Franjo Kuharić, also from Krašić. He became a priest in 1945 and succeeded Šeper (then already a cardinal) as the Archbishop of Zagreb in 1970. In 1983 pope John Paul II chose him as a cardinal. Kuharić remained on that duty until his retirement in 1997. Two influential Croatian politicians are known to have lived in Jastrebarsko. Vladko Maček, a Croatian politician from the first half of the 20th century also hails from Jastrebarsko. Born in a nearby village, Kupinec, Maček led the Croatian Peasant Party fighting for the independence of Croatia since the assassination of Stjepan Radić until World War II and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia by the Axis powers which defeated the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941. Ante Starčević, termed \\"Father of the Croatian homeland\\" (), fought for the independence and the democratical re-establishment of the medieval Kingdom of Croatia, opposing the Hungarian sympathizer and ban of Croatia Khuen-Héderváry. He lived in Jastrebarsko for seven years while working in a law practice. Boris Klemenić was mayor of the town for eight years.  References = Endnotes  1. Also mentioned as Gonjeva by Gregl. 2. Although Škrabe refers to an estimate of 600 years, the period of Jastrebarsko's free royal trading center actually could have lasted only 591 years.

It is situated on the former Polo Park Racetrack near the junction of Portage Avenue and St. James Street and is the largest mall of the eight malls in the city. It is the 15th largest shopping centre in Canada, between Guildford Town Centre and Laurier Québec. History The Polo Park Mall opened Thursday August 20, 1959 and became one of the first enclosed shopping malls in Canada when a roof was added in 1963, the other being the Park Royal Shopping Centre. The district was once the sports hub of Winnipeg, with the Winnipeg Arena, Canad Inns Stadium, and Winnipeg Velodrome all of which had been located at Polo Park. The Velodrome was torn down in the 1990s to make way for a strip mall that includes Home Depot and Chapters. The arena and stadium have also since been demolished and replaced by new retail and office complexes. The former CKY building is situated next to the mall. It used to house the city's CTV Television Network affiliate, CKY-TV, CKY radio, and FM 92 CITI. It was the original home of the WTN network. Corus Radio Winnipeg has occupied the building since 2011, as part of a lease agreement between Corus Entertainment and Cadillac Fairview. Studios for CJOB 680, CFPG- FM 99.1 and CJKR-FM 97.5 are located on the second floor of the three-story building.cky-dt, broadcasting-history.ca Expansions In the spring of 1968 a $7.5 million expansion of Polo Park was completed. The addition brought a three-storey Eaton's department store to the mix. With this add-on, Polo Park became the second largest shopping centre in Canada at the time. In 1986, the mall underwent a $75 million renovation that added a second level to the building. This addition was panned by downtown Winnipeg merchants, who voiced their objections to the plan at city council meetings in 1984; however, city council approved the expansion. The expanded shopping centre opened in mid- August 1986. Another expansion took place in 2007, which added . The cost of this addition was $30 million. A new $49-million expansion to Polo Park opened October 1, 2014 in the former Zellers space on the mall's second level. The redeveloped space included of retail space and 17 new stores. Polo Park has also added new retail complexes which are located on properties adjacent to the north of the mall. Polo North is located on the site of the former Winnipeg Arena, while The Plaza at Polo Park is being developed on the former Canad Inns Stadium grounds.

Q FM's primary format is contemporary Christian music, though it also airs Bible-based talk and teaching programming. The Bemidji area receives the Q FM broadcast on the main 107.1 FM frequency, while the Grand Forks area receives the Q FM broadcast at 104.9 FM via a translator station. KKEQ is a commercial radio station supported by advertising sales. Shine the Light, Inc is a non-profit organization that supports KKEQ by purchasing airtime to allow KKEQ to be a full-time Christian radio ministry. History The station signed on in 1972 as KEHG-FM 107.1 a 3,000 watt Class A simulcasting KEHG AM 1480. In 1983 Dale Olmstead purchased KEHG AM and FM from De La Hunt Broadcasting, and renamed them KKDQ AM and KKDQ-FM, and later became KKCQ AM and KKCQ-FM in 1990. In the early 1992, Pine To Prairie Broadcasting was formed with several investors with the intent of bringing Christian radio to northwest Minnesota, and purchased KKCQ AM and FM. KKCQ-FM upgraded to 50,000 watts, and signed on with a contemporary Christian music format as \\"Q107\\" on October 31, 1993, after periodically being off-the-air for testing. In 1995, Shine the Light, Inc., an evangelical Christian organization, took over the operation of KFNW-FM's Grand Forks, North Dakota translator (low power rebroadcaster) at 104.9 FM, and it began rebroadcasting Q107. Q107's call sign was changed to KKEQ in 1996 after Pine To Prairie Broadcasting signed on KKCQ-FM 96.7. Larry Roed was the first CEO of Pine To Prairie Broadcasting, and also the first general manager under the new ownership. Air staff over the years include Kevin Arvidson (a.k.a. Fred in the Morning), Dan Kindall, Tom Lano, JL Nesvold, Brian Fisher and current general manager Phil Ehlke. Q107 has organized numerous concerts, special events and promotions over the years, including the yard signs, the \\"Twelve Gifts of Christmas\\" and an ongoing the annual Extreme Faith youth conference, held at alternating locations throughout Q107's listening area. Q107 also airs Shopping on the Radio , a radio auction occasionally, which also has items for sale and auction from area retailers on its Web site. former Q107 logo In 2005, Q107 began streaming online, and Shine the Light, Inc. signed on Q107's second translator at 104.9 FM in Walker, Minnesota. The Grand Forks translator's transmitter was moved into city limits in 2006, greatly improving its signal to the Greater Grand Forks area. In 2007, Shine the Light signed on four translators in Thief River Falls, Park Rapids, Bemidji and Roseau. On July 7, 2008, KKEQ rebranded itself as \\"Your Q FM\\" to prevent confusion with its translators, along with switching programming from Salem's Today's Christian Music network to WAY-FM's Christian Hit Radio Satellite Network (CHRSN) in order to target a younger audience. In 2010, KKEQ's translator station at 94.9 K235BP in Bemidji switched to a broadcast of KBUN following a sale and a survey showing the majority of KKEQ's Bemidji listeners tune in on the main 107.1 frequency. In February 2011, Your Q FM built an additional studio and sales office in Grand Forks, North Dakota, where most of the programming is now broadcast from. Most satellite programming (from CHRSN) was dropped in favor of locally produced programming. Q FM continues to maintain a studio and sales office in Fosston, where some programming continues to be broadcast from, to meet FCC requirements and to continue serving the Fosston area as well. The station also operates a studio and sales office in Bemidji, Minnesota. In 2012, KKEQ's translator station at 102.9 K275BB in Roseau went off the air due to interference of its off-air feed from CKCL-FM in Winnipeg, which also broadcasts at 107.1 FM. CKCL had recently upgraded its power to 100,000 watts, and is located closer to Roseau than the main KKEQ broadcast. During February 2013, KKEQ applied to upgrade the main 107.1 FM signal from 50,000 to 100,000 watts on a taller tower near Bagley, improving its signal in Bemidji. The station completed its upgrade to the main signal in September 2014. At the end of 2013, KKCQ (AM) and KKCQ-FM were sold to R&J; Broadcasting of Ada, Minnesota. Studios and towers for these stations remain in Fosston. Ownership of both stations transferred to them in early 2014, according to FCC records.

Due to its historical associations, in Croatian \\"Kaptol\\" is also used as a metonym for the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia. History The existence of Kaptol, the settlement on the east slope, was confirmed in 1094 when King Ladislaus founded the Zagreb diocese. The bishop, his residence and the Cathedral had their seat in the southeast part of the Kaptol hill. VIaška Ves was situated in the close vicinity of the Cathedral. Being under the bishop's jurisdiction, it was first mentioned in 1198. Kaptol Street ran from the south to the north across the Kaptol terrace with canons' residences arranged in rows alongside. As the Latin word for a group or body of canons is \\"capitulum\\" (kaptol), it is clear how Kaptol got its name. The canons also ruled this settlement. The Cathedral was consecrated in 1217, but later in 1242 it was badly damaged during the Mongol invasion. After 1263 it was restored and rebuilt. As a settlement, Kaptol's shape was an unsymmetrical rectangle, which had a southern entrance in Bakačeva Street, and ended at its north end near the present day Kaptol School (Miroslav Krleža Elementary School). In the Middle Ages, Kaptol had no fortifications. It was merely enclosed with wooden fences or palisades, which were repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. The defensive walls and towers around Kaptol were built between 1469 and 1473. The Prislin Tower near the Kaptol School is one of the best-preserved from those times. In 1493 the Turks reached Sisak trying to capture it but were defeated there. Therefore, fearing the Turkish invasion, the Bishop of Zagreb had the fortifications built around the Cathedral and his residence. The defensive towers and walls built between 1512 and 1520 have been preserved until the present day except those that directly faced the front of the Cathedral situated at Kaptol Square. This section of the wall was pulled down in 1907. In the 13th century two Gothic churches were built in Kaptol, St. Francis with the Franciscan monastery and St. Mary, which underwent considerable reconstruction works in the 17th and the 18th centuries. In Opatovina, small dwelling houses of former Kaptol inhabitants can still be seen, but at Dolac a number of little and narrow streets were torn down in 1926 when the today's market was built. In 1334 the canons of Zagreb established a colony of Kaptol serfs in the vicinity of their residences, north of Kaptol. That was the beginning of a new settlement called Nova Ves (the present day Nova Ves Street). Neighbourhood Kaptol is today part of the Gornji Grad - Medveščak city district. It mainly faces the Kaptol Street, lying atop of the Ribnjak Park in the east. The Kaptol Centar shopping mall is located in Nova Ves. The central part of Kaptol is part of the local government \\"August Cesarec\\" that has a total population of 1,523 (2011).

Unlike English- speaking bands, very few acts reached worldwide success and often not even between different Spanish-speaking countries due to a lack of promotion. Despite rock en español 's origins in the late 1950s, many rock acts achieved at best nationwide fame until the Internet consolidated the listeners. However, some rock en español artists did become internationally popular with the help of a promotional campaign from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s called \\"\\" (\\"Rock in your language\\"). Some specific rock-based styles influenced by folkloric rhythms have also developed in these regions. Some of the more prominent styles are Latin rock, a fusion of rock music with Latin American and Caribbean folkloric sounds developed in Latino communities; Latin alternative, an alternative rock scene which blended a Latin sound with other genres like Caribbean ska, reggae, and soca; or Andalusian rock, a flamenco- influenced style that emerged in Spain. History= Beginnings (1956–1964) Los Teen Tops playing live in Argentina in 1962. Spanish- speaking rock music began in the late-1950s, through listening to performers like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Bill Haley, who popularized rockabilly in the United States. The song \\"El relojito\\" by Gloria Ríos released in 1956 is often considered the blueprint of rock en español. In 1958, Ritchie Valens covered the Mexican folk song \\"La Bamba\\", popularizing Spanish-language rock music throughout Latin America. That year, Daniel Flores performed his hit song \\"Tequila\\", which reached nº1 in Billboard charts. The new sound immediately caught the attention of the middle and upper class. The first rock bands in Latin America were created in the late 1950s with Los Llopis and Los Teen Tops achieving some success covering American rock classics during the early 1960s. The Spanish scene received some influences of non-English- speaking countries with the Yé-yé style as could be seen with Raphael. In the early 1960s, those styles of commercial rock music were nicknamed Nueva ola (New wave) in some South American countries to refer the bands that adopted the American and European styles. British invasion effect (1964–1970) Los Gatos in 1967. With their single \\"La balsa\\", they turned the movement into a massive youth phenomenon. After the popularization of The Beatles and the world success of the British Invasion, the Hispanophone world adapted new styles like Beat music, rhythm and blues, psychedelia, soul, folk-rock and pop music. The influences of beat music and psychedelic pop were noticeable in some acts such as Los Brincos, El Kinto, Los Gatos or The Speakers, while other successful bands featured mostly English and few Spanish vocals like Los Bravos or Los Shakers. Success outside of the native and Spanish-speaking scene proved difficult to attain though, and the few hits these bands achieved worldwide were sung in English, as Miguel Ríos and Los Bravos did for example. Los Saicos were one of the very oldest proto-punk bands in the world. By mid- decade the Mexican (later US citizen) Carlos Santana moved north to California and soon joined the burgeoning San Francisco rock scene. Forming the band Santana towards the end of the sixties, he would gather a shifting group of musicians from mixed Anglo-Saxon and Hispanic backgrounds; the band would become one of the more popular acts of the 1970s in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe and brought together elements of rock 'n' roll and jazz with Latin percussion and harmonics (as evidenced, for example, on Abraxas (1970) and Moonflower (1977)). The band would consistently alternate lyrics in Spanish and English; they were arguably the most successful crossover Latin/Anglo rock band to date, and were important in spreading interest in Latin percussion and drumming around the world. Although he is not a rock en español musician, Carlos Santana's background is that of a traditional Latin musician who has fused rock guitar (and jazz and salsa rhythms) with classic Latin American songs and a sizeable body of compositions by himself and his band. Their hit song \\"Oye Como Va\\" is an example of Santana's fusion, being originally composed by famous Latin jazz and mambo musician Tito Puente. From the late 1960s on, concurrently with the success of Santana, there was a growing interest in Latin-American folk music and dancing as well as a worldwide cultural boom for Latin-American literature and its colourful, sometimes surrealist and magic realist storytelling, which sustained an interest in Latin music in general, though not always in Latin rock music as such. There was a noticeable Latin influence in 1970s jazz (e.g. Herbie Hancock, Flora Purim, Return to Forever) and some acts like Malo were performing Latin Rock during the same decade. However, styles like blues, acid rock, hard rock, and prog rock would be very influential around the next decade. Almendra, led by Luis Alberto Spinetta, was one of the most important prog bands of the late 1960s and later, Spinetta would become one of the most important artists of the 1970s rock en español scene, Prog rock domain, hard rock origins and Repression (1970-1979) Luis Alberto Spinetta was the frontman of Almendra, Pescado Rabioso, Invisible, among others. Triana in the recording studio in 1974. Influenced by the new trends of the 60's, psychedelic acts like Los Dug Dug's, Pescado Rabioso (heavy psych)— or La Revolución de Emiliano Zapata (although rarely they featured Spanish vocals during these years); blues acts like Manal and progressive rock bands like Invisible, Sui Generis (folk prog), Témpano, Los Jaivas (Andean rock), Vox Dei (which style would turn harder sounding) or Triana (heavily influenced by flamenco) appeared. Triana were pioneers of the Andalusian rock scene, a new style which emerged in Spain that combined prog rock with flamenco. The first hard rock acts appeared in the early 1970s with bands like Pappo's Blues. Also, a new hard rock movement influenced by prog, blues and punk called Spanish Rock urbano lead the harder scene of the late 1970s with bands like Leño. But in these days appeared some repression of rock music in Mexico. The government forced artists, labels and radio stations to go \\"underground\\" as they associated the music with the breakdown of societal standards. The main pushing edge that created tension with the government was due to the Avándaro Rock Festival in 1971. Also the dictatorship established in Argentina in 1976 make some Argentine artist leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain. They joined the Spanish rock scene and sometimes Hispano-Argentine bands Tequila get formed and achieved success. Tequila joined an rock and roll, glam and rhythm & blues scene along with other Spanish acts Burning or La Orquesta Mondragón. Internationalization (1980s) Café Tacuba The most prominent punk bands appeared along the 1980s with La Polla Records, Siniestro Total or Los Violadores. Subgenres derived from punk like New Wave and Post punk were also important during the 1980s. La Movida Madrileña was an important movement of these styles among others. In the mid-1980s, a promotional campaign called \\"Rock en tu idioma\\" (Rock in your language) started helping to internationalize some bands. Soda Stereo is largely credited as the first Spanish-language rock band to gain widespread popularity across Latin America. However, there was equal transnational success in the late 1980s from Virus, Radio Futura, Enanitos Verdes, Caifanes, Hombres G, or Los Prisioneros among others during the same time period. Though mainly a teen-pop band, Puerto Rican band Menudo at times also dabbled into Rock en Espanol during this decade; examples of their rock music work include their albums \\"Quiero Ser\\" (alternatively named \\"Rock Chiquillo\\" in some markets), \\"A Todo Rock\\" and \\"Hijos del Rock\\" as well as songs such as \\"Quiero Rock\\", \\"Rock en la TV\\", \\"Mi Banda Toca Rock\\", \\"Sube a mi Motora\\" and \\"Jovenes\\".http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artistas/menudo/ Similarly, Los Chicos de Puerto Rico a band that was similar to Menudo, had a song named \\"Rock Solido\\" which was released during 1983. Recent times (1990s onward) Gustavo Cerati in Nueva York 2006. The final amalgamation into a coherent international scene was helped by the introduction of MTV Latin America in 1993, where the first video shown, \\"We are sudamerican rockers\\" by Chilean band Los Prisioneros, reflected its aims to create a Latin American scene. In the late 1990s, MTV created the Latino Award in the MTV Video Music Awards and Premios MTV Latinoamérica in 2002, awards that recognize the talented bands and achievements of the genre. However, MTV Latin America was criticized for focusing primarily on rock bands from Argentina and Mexico, with the occasional band from Chile or Colombia. For example, bands on MTV Latino that received very regular airplay were Soda Stereo, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Amigos Invisibles, Mano Negra, Café Tacuba, Los Tres, Aterciopelados, Maldita Vecindad, Babasónicos, Los Rodríguez and Héroes del Silencio. On the other hand, some hard rock bands like La Renga, Cuca or Extremoduro achieved success. During the success of Alternative rock in the 1990s, many bands performed alt rock and Latin Alternative (style that combined alt rock with ska, reggae and Latin folkloric elements) like Robi Draco Rosa, Caifanes, Café Tacuba, and La Ley initiated a new stage of Latin rock by broadening its international appeal. Since then, successful bands and musicians include Juanes, Libido, Maná (Mexico), Jaguares, Caramelos de Cianuro, Aterciopelados, Bersuit Vergarabat, Jorge Drexler and Los Tres among others. The new bands were able to be successful through the development of the music video in the 1990s. Rock en español in the United States Maná has earned four Grammy Awards. Rock en español borrows heavily from rock and roll music and traditional and popular music of Spanish-speaking countries such as cumbia, ranchera, rumba, and tango. In its 50-year history, it has evolved from having a cult-like following to being a more well established music genre. In Los Angeles, an underground scene has developed and continues to flourish that supports the local rock en español acts. Top bands from the LA REE scene include Los Invisibles of José L. Garza, Motita, Pastilla, Los Amigos Invisibles, Maria Fatal, Rascuache, Voz de Mano, Cabula, Satélite, Las 15 letras, Verdadera FE, and Los Olvidados. Record labels that have supported US based REE include Aztlan records, El Mero Mero Records, and Mofo Records. Many of them have been associated to the Chicano rock scene.

He was embroiled in a financial scandal. Scandal Bogdonoff made headlines in 2001 and 2002 after being accused of mismanaging millions of dollars from the nation of Tonga. He had been the Tongan government's financial advisor since 1994, claiming to have made the government millions in the rising stock markets of the booming 1990s. Bogdonoff managed the Tonga Trust Fund after it had been funded by the Tongan government in 1986 in a scheme in which the Tongan government sold passports to frightened Hong Kong nationals who were unnerved by the 1997 expiration of the British lease on Hong Kong from China. In 1999 Bogdonoff recommended moving the Tongan portfolio out of the bulging stock market bubble and into a pool of insurance backed investments called viatical contracts managed by the Millennium Asset Management Company. In 2001 he learned that Herchell Hyatt, the owner of Millennium Asset Management Company, had stolen millions of Tonga's money and filed false accounting statements for the Tonga account. Bogdonoff arranged a recovery program for Tonga backed by Lloyd's of London to protect against the losses. The Tongan government became paralyzed in an internal political debate led by the Tongan democracy movement in its effort to gain ground by embarrassing the royal family, which dismissed the only senior government ministers who were attempting to implement the recovery plan to save the Tonga Trust Fund. Without the recovery plan the Tonga Trust Fund was effectively wiped out. The government proceeded to sue Bogdonoff and all the parties involved in the transaction for fraud and negligence. Without admitting guilt of any fraud, Bogdonoff settled his part of the lawsuit in 2004. Post-scandal life As of 2006, Bogdonoff has not been to Tonga since 2004 due to his history there. He was not present during King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV's funeral in September 2006. Bogdonoff claimed he was concerned for his safety due to the large number of Tongan citizens who have settled in the United States. He now offers classes in hypnosis and is a clinical therapist using hypnosis to aid in recovery from post traumatic stress. As of 2006, now called Jesse Dean, he is the founder and sole practitioner of the Open Window Institute of Emotional Freedom in Sonoma County, California. Jester Bogdonoff's status as official court jester of Tupou's court made sensational news copy when the financial scandal hit the media in 2001. Tonga was the first royal court to appoint a court jester in modern times, being appointed in 1999. However, the royal decree was issued on April 1st, so it is not clear if the appointment was made in full seriousness.

Specifically it is when the ball-shaped head of the femur comes out of the cup-shaped acetabulum of the pelvis. Symptoms typically include pain and an inability to move the hip. Complications may include avascular necrosis of the hip, injury to the sciatic nerve, or arthritis. Dislocations are typically due to significant trauma such as a motor vehicle collision or fall from height. Often there are also other associated injuries. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by plain X-rays. Hip dislocations can also occur following a hip replacement or from a developmental abnormality known as hip dysplasia. Efforts to prevent the condition include wearing a seat-belt. Emergency treatment generally follows advanced trauma life support. This is generally followed by reduction of the hip carried out under procedural sedation. A CT scan is recommended following reduction to rule out complications. Surgery is required if the joint cannot be reduced otherwise. Often a few months are required for healing to occur. Hip dislocations are uncommon. Males are affected more often than females. Traumatic dislocations occurs most commonly in those 16 to 40 years old. The condition was first described in the medical press in the early 1800s.  Signs and symptoms  The affected leg is virtually immovable by the person, and is usually extremely painful. Dislocations are categorized as either posterior or anterior, based on the location of the head of the femur (see classification above).  Posterior dislocation  Nine out of ten hip dislocations are posterior. The affected limb will be in a position of flexion, adduction, and internally rotated in this case. The knee and the foot will be in towards the middle of the body. A sciatic nerve palsy is present in 8%-20% of cases.  Anterior dislocation  In an anterior dislocation the limb is held by the person in externally rotated, extension and abduction. Femoral nerve palsies can be present, but are uncommon. Cause Dislocations of the hip typically take a high degree of force. About 65% of cases are related to motor vehicle collisions, with falls and sports injuries being the cause of many of the rest. Mechanism The hip joint includes the articulation of the femoral head (of femur) and the acetabulum of the pelvis. In hip dislocation, the femoral head is dislodged from this socket. Posterior dislocation is the most prevalent, in which the femoral head lies posterior and superior to the acetabulum. This is most common when the femur is adducted and internally rotated. The opposite is true for the shoulder, where the most common dislocation occurs in the anterior and inferior directions. Motor vehicle traffic collisions are responsible for almost all posterior hip dislocations. The posterior side of the hip exhibits primarily hip extension, dealing with the muscles: gluteus maximus, hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), and the six deep external rotators (piriformis, obturator externus, obturator internus, gemellus superior, gemellus inferior, and quadrates femoris).Floyd, R.T. (2009). Manual of structural kinesiology. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill To actually dislocate a healthy hip, a great amount of force needs to be applied. Falls from a height, such as a ladder, can also generate enough force to dislocate a hip. In older individuals, even a slight fall could cause this type of injury. Wear and tear that the body undergoes throughout the years leads to increased incidents of hip dislocation in the older population. Several other injuries are also associated with hip dislocation. Fractures in the pelvis and legs, and minor back or head injuries can also occur, along with a hip dislocation, that is caused by a fall or athletic injury.  Diagnosis  Reimer's migration index can be used to indicate hip dislocation. The migration index (MI) is normally less than 33%. Anterior-posterior (AP) X-rays of the pelvis, AP and lateral views of the femur (knee included) are ordered for diagnosis. The size of the head of the femur is then compared across both sides of the pelvis. The affected femoral head will appear larger if the dislocation is anterior, and smaller if posterior. A CT scan may also be ordered to clarify the fracture pattern.  Classification  Posterior dislocation = Posterior dislocations with an associated fracture are categorised by the Thompson and Epstein classification system, the Stewart and Milford classification system, and the Pipkin system (when associated with femoral head fractures). = Anterior dislocation = There is also a Thompson and Epstein classification system for anterior hip dislocations. = Central dislocation = Central dislocation is an outdated term for medial displacement of the femoral head into a displaced acetabular fracture. It is no longer used. =Hip dysplasia = Dislocation of the left hip, secondary to developmental hip dysplasia. Closed arrow marks the acetabulum, open arrow the femoral head. Hip dysplasia is a condition in which a child is born with a hip problem. Hip dysplasia is when the formation of the hip joint is abnormal. The ball at the top of the thighbone which is known as the femoral head is not stable within the socket (which is also known as the acetabulum). Hip dysplasia is the preferred term because it provides a more accurate description of the spectrum of abnormalities that affect the immature hip. The term \\"congenital\\" dislocation is no longer recommended, except for very rare conditions, in which there is a (\\"teratologic\\") fixed dislocation location present at birth.  Management = Uncomplicated  The hip should be reduced as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. This is done via inline manual traction with general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, or conscious sedation. Fractures of the femoral head and other loose bodies should be determined prior to reduction. Common closed reduction methods include the Allis method and Stimson method. Once reduction is completed management becomes less urgent and appropriate workup including CT scanning can be completed. Post-reduction, people may begin early crutch- assisted ambulation with weight bearing as tolerated.  Complicated  If the dislocated hip cannot be reduced by manipulation alone, an immediate open (surgical) reduction is necessary. A CT scan or Judet views should be obtained prior to transfer to the surgical suite. Rehabilitation Hip dislocation rehabilitation can take anywhere from two to three months, depending on the person. Complications to nearby nerves and blood vessels can sometimes cause loss of blood supply to the bone, also known as osteonecrosis. The protective cartilage on the bone can also be disturbed from this type of injury. For this reason, it is important for people to contact a physician and get treatment immediately following injury. * The first step to recovering from a hip dislocation is reduction. This refers to putting the bones back into their intended positions. Normally, this is done by a physician while the person is under a sedative. Other times, a surgical procedure is required to reduce the hip bones back into their natural state. * Next, rest, ice, and take anti- inflammatory medication to reduce swelling at the hip. * Weight bearing is allowed for the type one posterior dislocation, but should only be done as pain allows and person is comfortable. * Within 5–7 days of the injury occurrence, people may perform passive range of motion exercises to increase flexibility. * A walking aid should be used until the person is comfortable with both weight bearing and range of motion. Exercises A set of ankle weights. Modified side plank. Individuals suffering from hip dislocation should participate in physical therapy and receive professional prescriptive exercises based on their individual abilities, progress, and overall range of motion. The following are some typical recommended exercises used as rehabilitation for hip dislocation. It is important to understand that each individual has different capabilities that can best be assessed by a physical therapist or medical professional, and that these are simply recommendations. * Bridge- Lie flat on back. Place arms with palms down beside body. Keep feet hip distance apart and bend knees. Slowly lift hips upward. Hold position for three to five seconds. This helps strengthen the glutes and increase stability of the hip joint. * Supine leg abduction- Lie flat on back. Slowly slide leg away from body and then back in, keeping the knees straight. This exercises the gluteus medius and helps to maintain stability in the hip while walking. * Side Lying Leg abduction- Lie on one side with one leg on top of the other. Slowly lift the top leg towards the ceiling and then lower it back down slowly. * Standing Hip abduction- Standing up and holding on to a nearby surface, slowly lift one leg away from the midline of the body and then lower it back to starting position. This is simply a more advanced way to do any of the lying hip abduction exercises, and should be done as the person progresses in rehab. * Knee raises- While standing and holding onto a chair, slowly lift one leg off the ground and bring it closer to the body while bending the knee. Then lower the leg back down slowly. This helps to strengthen the hip flexor muscles and retain stability in the hip. * Hip flexion and extensions- Standing, hold on to a nearby chair or surface. Swing one leg forwards away from you, and hold the position for three to five seconds. Then swing the leg slowly backwards and behind your body. Hold for three to five seconds. This exercise helps to increase range of motion, as well as strengthening the hip flexor and hip extensor muscles that control much of the hip joint. * Adding ankle weights to any exercises can be done as progress is made in rehabilitation. Epidemiology 16-40 year-old males are responsible for the majority of hip dislocations. These hip dislocations are typically posterior, and a direct result of motor vehicle traffic collisions.

Design work was done at the Avion Corporation, which in 1929, became the Northrop Aircraft Corporation based in Burbank, California. Design and development Drawing on his experience with the Lockheed Vega, John K. Northrop designed an advanced mail/passenger transport aircraft. In addition to all-metal construction, the new Alpha benefitted from two revolutionary aerodynamic advancements: wing fillets researched at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and a multicellular stressed-skin wing of Northrop's own design which was later successfully used on the Douglas DC-2 and Douglas DC-3. In addition, the Alpha was the first commercial aircraft to use rubber deicer boots on wing and empennage leading edges which, in conjunction with state-of-the-art radio navigation equipment, gave it day or night, all-weather capability. The aircraft first flew in 1930, with a total of 17 built.Smith 1986 The Alpha was further developed into a dedicated fast transport, the Northrop Gamma. Operational history Alpha in TWA colors on display at the National Air and Space Museum Under the Northrop Alpha The Alpha entered service with Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) making its inaugural flight on April 20, 1931. The trip from San Francisco to New York required 13 stops and took just over 23 hours. TWA operated 14 aircraft until 1935, flying routes with stops in San Francisco, California; Winslow, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Amarillo, Texas; Wichita, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; Terre Haute, Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and New York. Three Alphas were operated by the US military as C-19 VIP transports until 1939.Smith 1986 TWA's were initially operated as a passenger service but the Alpha's were later modified at the Stearman factory in Wichita into the cargo-carrying 4A model with a new type certificate. Stearman and Northrop had the same parent company at the time. The third Alpha built, NC11Y, was reacquired by TWA in 1975, and is preserved at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

History There are no census records indicating inhabitation in the recent past, although the loch area was the subject of border disputes in the 19th century. In 1851 these were resolved by the unusual decision to allocate the whole of Seaforth Island to both counties, Ross-shire and Inverness-shire, which at the time controlled Lewis and Harris respectively. This situation continued until the 1975 county reorganisation.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 2 Feb. 2013 Return to England and martyrdom He returned to the dangers of England in 1602 as a secular priest and administered to the faithful there. He was arrested in 1608, and then again in 1612. In November 1612, seven priests escaped from prison. It was alleged that, whilst in prison, Almond had said that \\"whosoever had killed a king, and were afterward penitent ... and did confesse the same to a priest, might have absolution\\". John Almond was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 5 December 1612 at Tyburn, London, England. During his final speech on the scaffold he condemned regicide, discussed the nature of grace and true repentance, and said that he conceded as much authority to James as to any Christian prince.

He has developed and popularized a number of Internet technologies since the late 1980s, including the Gopher protocol, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and POPmail. He is said to have coined the phrase \\"surfing the Internet.\\". However, prior to McCahill's first use of the phrase in February, 1992, surfing the Internet was popularized in a comic Book, \\"The Adventures of Captain Internet and CERF Boy\\", published in October, 1991 by one of the early Internet Service Providers, CERFnet . Career Mark McCahill received a BA in Chemistry at the University of Minnesota in 1979, spent one year doing analytical environmental chemistry, and then joined the University of Minnesota Computer Center as a programmer. Internet pioneer In the late 1980s, McCahill led the team at the University of Minnesota that developed POPmail, one of the first popular Internet e-mail clients. At about the same time as POPmail was being developed, Steve Dorner at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed Eudora, and the user interface conventions found in these early efforts are still used in modern-day e-mail clients. In 1991, McCahill led the original Gopher development team, which invented a simple way to navigate distributed information resources on the Internet. Gopher's menu-based hypermedia combined with full-text search engines paved the way for the popularization of the World Wide Web and was the de facto standard for Internet information systems in the early to mid 1990s. Working with other pioneers such as Tim Berners- Lee, Marc Andreessen, Alan Emtage and Peter J. Deutsch (creators of Archie) and Jon Postel, McCahill was involved in creating and codifying the standard for Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). In the mid 90s, McCahill's team developed GopherVR, a 3D user interface for the Gopher protocol to explore how spatial metaphors could be used to organize information and create social spaces. Later work In April 2007, McCahill left the University of Minnesota to join the Office of Information Technology at Duke University as an architect of 3-D learning and collaborative systems. A major focus of his later work has been virtual worlds, and he was one of six principal architects of the Croquet Project. Virtual worlds In February 2010, Mark McCahill was revealed by the philosopher Peter Ludlow (also known by the pseudonym Urizenus Sklar) to be the Internet persona Pixeleen Mistral, a noted \\"tabloid reporter\\" covering virtual worlds who was the editor of Ludlow's newspaper The Alphaville Herald. In a 2016 interview with Leo Laporte, McCahill said that his involvement with developing the Croquet Project had led him into contact with Second Life and that he had become interested in the sociology of virtual worlds. As Pixeleen Mistral, he was a prominent reporter on Second Life, and a celebrity inside the game, although his real identity was not known by anyone for many years.  Personal life  McCahill currently works at the Office of Information Technology at Duke University as an architect of 3-D learning and collaborative systems.

The Gacka river also runs through the area. The population of the municipality is 917, with Croats making up the majority at 94.33%, and with 468 people living in the settlement of Karlobag (2011 census). Today, chief occupations are fishing and tourism. Main activities include boating and hiking, as Karlobag is known for its excellent trails. The Velebit mountains rising above Karlobag have been declared the a world biosphere reserve, currently the only one in Croatia. History Karlobag the Karlobag municipality within Lika-Senj County The town of Karlobag is first mentioned in 1387, as \\"Bag\\", founded by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in the 14th century, and is thus named after him (Karlo being the Croatian variant of Charles.) It has such strong connections with the interior that its town centre is completely different from other Mediterranean settlements. Pliny and Ptolemy mentioned it as the Roman \\"Vegia\\".Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, 3.25(21). During the migration of the nations Vegia collapsed, but in the 7th century the Croats built a new settlement to the west of the Roman town, called Skrisa (Opidum Scrissi) which was later known as Bag, the seat of the noble Tugomirić family, then of Gusić- Kurjaković and Mogorović-Disislavić families. The Turkish invasion of Lika completely changed the course of this town's development. In 1525 it was completely destroyed by the Turks, leaving only a fortress with a small military presence. While Venice was considering whether to completely abandon or rebuild the town, the people of Senj turned to the Austrian Archduke Karl (the founder of the \\"Vojna Krajina\\", the military border area) and he built a new town in 1579, which, from 1580 on became known as Karlobag.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 144, Zagreb (1999), However, just as the town had been restored (1592) the Venetians took over the fortress and destroyed the town. Right up until 1683 Karlobag was inhabited only by military units. Another Habsburg ruler (also called Karl) was responsible for Karlobag's further development, the last male member of the family and father of Maria Theresa, Charles VI. His interest in this town was the result of his so-called \\"Adriatic orientation\\", for before him Austria had shown little interest in the Adriatic. He has a harbour built and planned a road to Gospić. His grandson Joseph II joined Karlobag to the \\"Vojna Krajina\\" in 1776 and in 1786 built another road over Velebit. During Napoleon's rule, Karlobag also suffered shelling from English warships, in 1813. Until 1918, Karlobag (named CARLOBAGO before 1850, later KARLOPAGO) was part of the (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia after the compromise of 1867), in the Croatian Military Frontier, Likaner Regiment N°I.Handbook of Austria and Lombardy- Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961. Landmarks The town itself has several historical landmarks, especially the 1713 Capuchin Monastery which has many old paintings, the most important monument of culture in the town. A small exhibition of ecclesiastical art, an archive and a library is arranged in the monastery. Also other churches, most dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. On the hill above town are the ruins of a Middle Ages fortress called Fortica, and the baroque church of Saint Charles of Borromeo (1776), built on the site of a church of 1615. The town is also home to a monument to the Croatian linguist Šime Starčević.

The hardware systems architect or hardware architect is responsible for: *Interfacing with a systems architect or client stakeholders. It is extraordinarily rare nowadays for sufficiently large and/or complex hardware systems that require a hardware architect not to require substantial software and a systems architect. The hardware architect will therefore normally interface with a systems architect, rather than directly with user(s), sponsor(s), or other client stakeholders. However, in the absence of a systems architect, the hardware systems architect must be prepared to interface directly with the client stakeholders in order to determine their (evolving) needs to be realized in hardware. The hardware architect may also need to interface directly with a software architect or engineer(s), or with other mechanical or electrical engineers. *Generating the highest level of hardware requirements, based on the user's needs and other constraints such as cost and schedule. *Ensuring that this set of high level requirements is consistent, complete, correct, and operationally defined. *Performing cost–benefit analyses to determine the best methods or approaches for meeting the hardware requirements; making maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf or already developed components. *Developing partitioning algorithms (and other processes) to allocate all present and foreseeable (hardware) requirements into discrete hardware partitions such that a minimum of communications is needed among partitions, and between the user and the system. *Partitioning large hardware systems into (successive layers of) subsystems and components each of which can be handled by a single hardware engineer or team of engineers. *Ensuring that maximally robust hardware architecture is developed. *Generating a set of acceptance test requirements, together with the designers, test engineers, and the user, which determine that all of the high level hardware requirements have been met, especially for the computer-human- interface. *Generating products such as sketches, models, an early user's manual, and prototypes to keep the user and the engineers constantly up to date and in agreement on the system to be provided as it is evolving. Background Large systems architecture was developed as a way to handle systems too large for one person to conceive of, let alone design. Systems of this size are rapidly becoming the norm, so architectural approaches and architects are increasingly needed to solve the problems of large systems. Users and sponsors Engineers as a group do not have a reputation for understanding and responding to human needs comfortably or for developing humanly functional and aesthetically pleasing products. Architects are expected to understand human needs and develop humanly functional and aesthetically pleasing products. A good architect is a translator between the user/sponsor and the engineers—and even among just engineers of different specialties. A good architect is also the principal keeper of the user's vision of the end product—and of the process of deriving requirements from and implementing that vision. Determining what the users/sponsors actually want, rather than what they say they want, is not engineering—it is an art. An architect does not follow an exact procedure. S/he communicates with users/sponsors in a highly interactive way—together they extract the true requirements necessary for the engineered system. The hardware architect must remain constantly in communication with the end users (or a systems architect). Therefore, the architect must be familiar with the user's environment and problem. The engineer need only be very knowledgeable of the potential engineering solution space. High-level requirements The user/sponsor should view the architect as the user's representative and provide all input through the architect. Direct interaction with project engineers is generally discouraged as the chance of mutual misunderstanding is very high. The user requirements' specification should be a joint product of the user and hardware architect (or, the systems and hardware architects): the user brings his needs and wish list, the architect brings knowledge of what is likely to prove doable within cost and time constraints. When the user needs are translated into a set of high level requirements is also the best time to write the first version of the acceptance test, which should, thereafter, be religiously kept up to date with the requirements. That way, the user will be absolutely clear about what s/he is getting. It is also a safeguard against untestable requirements, misunderstandings, and requirements creep. The development of the first level of hardware engineering requirements is not a purely analytical exercise and should also involve both the hardware architect and engineer. If any compromises are to be made—to meet constraints like cost, schedule, power, or space, the architect must ensure that the final product and overall look and feel do not stray very far from the user's intent. The engineer should focus on developing a design that optimizes the constraints but ensures a workable and reliable product. The architect is primarily concerned with the comfort and usability of the product; the engineer is primarily concerned with the producibility and utility of the product. The provision of needed services to the user is the true function of an engineered system. However, as systems become ever larger and more complex, and as their emphases move away from simple hardware components, the narrow application of traditional hardware development principles is found to be insufficient—the application of the more general principles of hardware architecture to the design of (sub) systems is seen to be needed. A Hardware architecture is also a simplified model of the finished end product—its primary function is to define the hardware components and their relationships to each other so that the whole can be seen to be a consistent, complete, and correct representation of what the user had in mind—especially for the computer–human interface. It is also used to ensure that the components fit together and relate in the desired way. It is necessary to distinguish between the architecture of the user's world and the engineered hardware architecture. The former represents and addresses problems and solutions in the user's world. It is principally captured in the computer–human interfaces (CHI) of the engineered system. The engineered system represents the engineering solutions—how the engineer proposes to develop and/or select and combine the components of the technical infrastructure to support the CHI. In the absence of an architect, there is an unfortunate tendency to confuse the two architectures, since the engineer thinks in terms of hardware, but the user may be thinking in terms of solving a problem of getting people from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable expenditure of energy, or of getting needed information to customers and staff. A hardware architect is expected to combine knowledge of both the architecture of the user's world and of (all potentially useful) hardware engineering architectures. The former is a joint activity with the user; the latter is a joint activity with the engineers. The product is a set of high level requirements reflecting the user's requirements which can be used by the engineers to develop hardware systems design requirements. Because requirements evolve over the course of a project, especially a long one, an architect is needed until the hardware system is accepted by the user: the architect is the best insurance that no changes and interpretations made during the course of development compromise the user's viewpoint. Cost–benefit analyses Most hardware engineers are specialists. They know the applications of hardware design and development intimately, apply their knowledge to practical situations—that is, solve real world problems, evaluate the cost–benefits of various solutions within their hardware specialty, and ensure the correct operation of whatever they design. Hardware architects are generalists. They are not expected to be experts in any one hardware technology or approach, but are expected to be knowledgeable of many, and able to judge their applicability to specific situations. They also apply their knowledge to practical situations, but evaluate the cost/benefits of various solutions using different hardware technologies, for example, specially developed versus commercially available hardware components, and assure that the system as a whole performs according to the user's expectations. Many commercial-off-the-shelf or already developed hardware components may be selected independently according to constraints such as cost, response, throughput, etc. In some cases, the architect can already assemble the end system unaided. Or, s/he may still need the help of a hardware engineer to select components and to design and build any special purpose function. The architects (or engineers) may also enlist the aid of specialists—in safety, security, communications, special purpose hardware, graphics, human factors, test and evaluation, quality control, RMA, interface management, etc. An effective hardware architectural team must have immediate access to specialists in critical specialties. Partitioning and layering An architect planning a building works on the overall design, making sure it will be pleasing and useful to its inhabitants. While a single architect by himself may be enough to build a single-family house, many engineers may be needed, in addition, to solve the detailed problems that arise when a novel high-rise building is designed. If the job is large and complex enough, parts of the architecture may be designed as components. That is, if we are building a housing complex, we may have one architect for the complex, and one for each type of building, as part of an architectural team. Large hardware systems also require an architect and much engineering talent. If the engineered system is large and complex enough, the chief hardware systems architect may defer to subordinate architects for parts of the job, although they all may be members of a joint architectural team. But the architect must never be viewed as an engineering supervisor. The architect should sub-allocate the hardware requirements to major components or subsystems that are within the scope of a single hardware engineer, or engineering manager or subordinate architect. Ideally, each such hardware component/subsystem is a sufficiently stand-alone object that it can be tested as a complete component, separate from the whole, using only a simple testbed to supply simulated inputs and record outputs. That is, it is not necessary to know how an air traffic control system works in order to design and build a data management subsystem for it. It is only necessary to know the constraints under which the subsystem will be expected to operate. A good architect ensures that the system, however complex, is built upon relatively simple and \\"clean\\" concepts for each (sub) system or layer—easily understandable by everyone, especially the user, without special training. The architect will use a minimum of rules to ensure that each partition is well-defined and clean of kludges, work-arounds, short-cuts, or confusing detail and exceptions. As user needs evolve, (once the system is fielded and in use), it is a lot easier subsequently to evolve a simple concept than one laden with exceptions, special cases, and much \\"fine print.\\" Layering the hardware architecture is important for keeping it sufficiently simple at each layer so that it remains comprehensible to a single mind. As layers are ascended, whole systems at lower layers become simple components at the higher layers, and may disappear altogether at the highest layers. Acceptance test The acceptance test always remains the principal responsibility of the architect(s). It is the chief means by which the architect will prove to the user that the hardware is as originally planned and that all subordinate architects and engineers have met their objectives. Large projects tend to be dynamic, with changes along the way needed by the user (e.g., as his problems change), or expected of the user (e.g., for cost or schedule reasons). But acceptance tests must be kept current at all times. They are the principal means by which the user is kept informed as to how the final product will perform. And they act as the principal goal towards which all subordinate personnel must design, build and test for. Good communications with users and engineers A building architect uses sketches, models, drawings. A hardware systems architect should use sketches, models, and prototypes to discuss different solutions and results with the user or system architect, engineers, and subordinate architects. An early, draft version of the user's manual is invaluable, especially in conjunction with a prototype. A set of (engineering) requirements as a means of communicating with the users is explicitly to be avoided. A well written set of requirements, or specification, is intelligible only to the engineering fraternity, much as a legal contract is for lawyers.

second-generation home video game console that was released in Germany, England, France, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands and Australia in 1978 by German hearing aid manufacturer Interton. The console is quite obscure outside Germany, but many software-compatible systems can be found in numerous European countries (see versions of the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System). The console is the successor of the Interton Video 3001 and was sold for 298 Deutsche Mark and discontinued in 1983. It's unknown if Interton designed and produced the Interton VC 4000 within their own rights, or if they were sold the rights to design and produce it. This is because many other foreign brands have produced \\"clones\\" of this system in the preceding years. The Interton VC 4000's power comes from a Signetics 2650 CPU (which is the same as an Arcadia 2001) and a Signetics 2636 gaming controller. Both controllers contain a 12-button keypad, two fire buttons, and a joystick. Inside the systems control panel, there are four different buttons. The ON/OFF switch, RESET, SELECT, and START. Released versions The console was produced by different companies and sold with different names. Not every console is compatible with others due to differences in the shapes and dimensions of the cartridge slots, but all of the systems are software compatible.

Biography Born in Passaic, New Jersey, Breeman enlisted in the United States Navy on June 2, 1902, and was rated as a landsman for training. He served briefly in the receiving ships and before being assigned to the gunboat on September 19, 1902. On March 23, 1903 while still in Topeka, he was rated an ordinary seaman. In May 1903, Breeman was reassigned to . On April 13, 1906, a flash fire occurred in Kearsarges forward 13-inch turret, where Breeman was serving, killing several officers and men. Burning powder fell into the 13-inch handling room below. Breeman rushed from his battle station in the adjacent powder magazine into the handling room and stamped out the fires. He then returned to the magazine, closed the hatch to the handling room, and began replacing the covers on open powder tanks. Breeman received the Medal of Honor on May 5, 1906 for his actions on board Kearsarge the previous month and received $100 as a gratuity. Not long thereafter, his term of enlistment expired, and Breeman received an honorable discharge from the Navy. On September 16, 1912, he reenlisted at New York City. After a brief period of service in , he transferred to the battleship on December 23, 1912, where he served for a little more than eight years. During most of that time, his ship operated in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. During America's participation in World War I, however, he and his ship helped to train gunners in northern waters. At the end of the war, Breeman made four voyages to Europe and back in bringing veterans home. During his long tour of duty in New Hampshire, he advanced to the rank of chief turret captain. On May 20, 1921, Breeman transferred to the receiving ship at Hampton Roads, Virginia, before moving on to a tour of duty at the Naval Air Station Anacostia, in Washington, D.C. In March 1922, Breeman returned to sea in the new battleship . That final sea duty assignment lasted for almost three years. On May 31, 1927, he went ashore for the last time. After successive tours at the Naval Training Station, Hampton Roads, and the Navy Recruiting Station, Newark, New Jersey, Breeman was transferred to the Fleet Reserve on January 3, 1929. Chief Turret Captain Breeman died of a heart attack on April 10, 1937, in Passaic. On April 14, 1947, he was buried in Section 6 of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. USS Breeman The destroyer escort was launched on September 4, 1943, by the Dravo Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The launching ceremony was sponsored by his niece, Mrs. Marie Breeman Schellgell. The vessel was commissioned by the United States Navy on December 12, 1943, with Lt. Comdr. Edward N.W. Hunter commanding. The boat saw service throughout the Atlantic Ocean during World War II, before being decommissioned on April 26, 1946. The Breeman was later transferred to the Nationalist government of China on October 29, 1948. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Seaman, U.S. Navy. Born: September 15, 1880, Passaic, N.J.

Considered one of the finest racetracks in Western Canada, it was built by Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee R. James Speers. The six- furlong track opened in 1925 (replacing Speer's River Park Racetrack) under the charter of the Winnipeg Jockey Club and the charter of St. Vital Agricultural Society in Winnipeg, Manitoba. At the same time, James Speers founded the Prairie Thoroughbred Breeders' Association to promote a breeding industry in Western Canada. In 1930 he created the Canadian Derby, a premier race for Canadian-bred three-year-old Thoroughbreds hosted by Polo Park Racetrack until its closure in 1956. Besides the track, the facility had stables, grandstand and clubhouse for the Manitoba Jockey Club. In the winter the racetrack constructed two large toboggan slides, which operated in each direction. James Speers acquired land to build what would become Assiniboia Downs and granted an option on the Polo Park lands to real estate developers who wished to build a shopping centre on the site. Speers died in July 1955 and Polo Park Racetrack closed at the end of the 1956 racing season. The new mall opened in 1959. Winnipeg did not have a racing meet in 1957, but Assiniboia Downs opened in June 1958 and racing continued. References * Wilson, Keith & Lussier, Antoine S.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce. The short was released on August 29, 1953. It was the first appearance of Speedy Gonzales, in a prototype form. Because this cartoon's rendition of Speedy Gonzales looked rather coarse, they redesigned him for future cartoon releases. The cartoon has been criticized for its stereotypical and insensitive depictions of Mexicans. Plot The two cats pursuing Speedy in Cat-Tails for Two are the slow-witted (and injury- causing) Benny and the fully functioning but unfortunate George, both patterned after the characters Lennie and George in the novel Of Mice and Men. George and Benny are walking down a pier looking for food, when they find a Mexican ship. Figuring the ship will have plenty of Mexican mice, i.e. \\"Mexican food\\" (Benny: \\"It gives me the heartburn and I love it!\\"), they climb on, only to find an unkempt mouse calling himself \\"Speedy Gonzales: The Fastest Mouse in All Mexico\\". George and Benny go through numerous attempts to capture Speedy, who always outwits them. Speedy comes to think of them as private entertainment, at one point declaring \\"I like those fellows. All the time having fon (fun)!\\" Among the cats' failed attempts: 1\\\\. A crate full of \\"Acme Anvils\\" set above a piece of cheese. With Benny holding the rope and George setting the bait, Speedy gives Benny a scare from behind, causing him to let go of the rope and the crate to flatten George. As punishment, George swings down on Benny's cranium with a mallet, but the mallet bounces off Benny's head right on top of his own! When Benny asks \\"Why did you hit yourself on the head for, George?\\", the slap-happy cat answers: \\"I like it, I like it!!\\" 2\\\\. George sets up seven pieces of cheese with dynamite-stick booby traps throughout the ship, but doesn't have a match to light the sticks. Speedy taunts George with a match and sets him up to take the explosions. Benny comes to the rescue by cooling George down, but misinterprets a bucket of petrol as \\"a funny way to spell 'water'\\" leaving him half furless. 3\\\\. A pipe with one end disguised as an entranceway to a cabaret and Benny standing at the other end with a mallet. When Speedy enters the pipe, George fires a skyrocket in behind him, the idea being to force Speedy out into the path of the mallet. But the rocket unexpectedly yanks George through the pipe behind it. Speedy is too fast for Benny, and Benny ends up clobbering George when he is pulled out the other side turning his head into a mallet size. Finally, the two cats run a pipe into Speedy's hiding place (to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse), but Speedy grabs a wrench and bends the pipe back around to the cats, unbeknownst to them. George starts shoving a lot of dynamite into the pipe, resulting in a mountain of TNT piling up behind him and Benny. When George is done shoving dynamite through the pipe, he lights the last stick with a match, and the mountain of dynamite blasts him and Benny up into the air. As they descend, Benny asks George about their Mexican dinner, with George responding \\"I kind of lost my appetite for Mexican food,\\" before both cats plunge into the harbor. A smug Speedy looks at the camera and declares \\"I love those fellows. They're so see-lee (silly)!\\" Iris out.

Early life Steamer was born in Fort Myers, Florida, United States, and began skateboarding in 1989. Steamer frequented a small city owned skate park on Grand Avenue. Professional skateboarding=1995–1998: Toy Machine, Welcome To Hell Although she received a concurrent offer from Real Skateboards to ride the company's decks, Steamer first began receiving skateboard decks from Lance Mountain in 1995, who was running a company named \\"The Firm\\" at the time. Steamer's first official skateboard deck sponsor was Toy Machine, founded and owned by professional skateboarder, Ed Templeton. Professional skateboarder, Chad Muska, then a leading member of the Toy Machine team, facilitated Steamer's sponsorship; at the time of Steamer's acceptance, Toy Machine consisted of Templeton, Muska, Mike Maldonado, Jamie Thomas, and Brian Anderson. Steamer subsequently filmed for her Welcome to Hell video part, a 1996 project primarily driven by Thomas, who temporarily resided with Steamer in Fort Myers to undertake the camera work for Steamer's section in the video. Steamer remained with the company following Thomas and Muska's departure and contributed a video part for Toy Machine's next film project, Jump Off A Building. 1998–2003: Baker, Baker 2G, Bootleg Following the departure of numerous co-riders from Toy Machine, Steamer informed Templeton by telephone that she was also leaving and joined the Bootleg brand which was founded as a sub-division of the Baker skateboard company. Bootleg was distributed by the NHS, Inc. company (Independent, Creature, Santa Cruz) and Steamer's involvement was a progression of her personal connection to skateboarders such as Andrew Reynolds and Erik Ellington. Bootleg was founded by Jay Strickland, who also cofounded the Baker brand with Reynolds, and was a short-lived, month-long venture that ended following a video release, Bootleg 3000. Prior to Bootleg 3000, Steamer's video parts were included in the Baker Bootleg and 2G videos. Steamer stated in 2014 that her highest paycheck from skateboard deck royalties was received during her time with Bootleg. 2004–2011: Zero, Fourth X Games gold Steamer was provided with a three-month paycheck following the demise of Bootleg in 2004, and Frank Gerwer, a professional skateboarder who lived with Steamer, attempted to negotiate a sponsorship deal with the Anti-Hero brand that he also rode for, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Thomas, who had by this time founded his own skateboard company, Zero, asked Steamer to ride for the brand, and she joined the Zero team in June 2006. Following Steamer's transition to Zero, she filmed a shared video part with Thomas, who had not amassed enough footage for a full-length part. Steamer never filmed a full- length video part while she was a member of the Zero team (Thomas has stated in an online interview that Steamer never released a full-length part due to insufficient involvement with the company's filmers and a tendency to lose momentum due to outside distractions). At the 2008 X Games event in Los Angeles, US, Steamer won her fourth X Games gold medal in the Women's Street event. The women's category was introduced in 2004 and 2007 was the only year that Steamer did not win gold, as she won silver after Marisa del Santo. Following her victory, Steamer explained to the New York Times that she felt like vomiting for the entire duration of the contest and attributed the issue to \\"old age\\". At the time, Mimi Knoop, a professional vert skater and vice president of the Action Sports Alliance, a nonprofit association of professional women's skateboarders, said that \\"Elissa has paved the way for those girls in street and set the bar ability-wise for all those girls that are coming up.\\" Steamer eventually parted ways with Zero in July 2011 and explained in an ESPN interview: > Me and Jamie [Thomas] have been friends for a long time. It was a difficult > decision to make. It's hard enough to make career decisions let alone those > heavy ones. It's like breaking up with someone, you know? Zero was five > years of my life. Of course I'm thankful for that. And Jamie hooked me up. 2012–present: Gnarhunters, Return to Baker In late September 2013, Steamer launched a collaboration with the FTC skateboard shop/brand entitled \\"Gnarhunters.\\" Steamer explains in the promotional video that, as of the FTC collaboration, Gnarhunters is a \\"project,\\" but will eventually become a brand. Steamer received artistic support from professional skateboarders Brian Anderson and Frank Gerwer, as well as professional artists. As of July 2014, the company is registered in the American city of San Francisco. In June 2018, Bakerboys Distribution's Shake Junt released an Elissa Steamer guest board along with a 'Ride or Die' web short featuring recent skatepark footage. Later in the same month, Baker Skateboards introduced Steamer to the pro team, releasing her first signature board for the brand. Awards In 2003, Steamer was voted \\"Female Skater of the Year\\" by Check it Out Girls magazine. Video games Steamer appeared as a playable character in the first five installments of the Tony Hawk's Pro-Skater series. In 2014, Steamer explained that her biggest paychecks during her skateboarding career were due to video game royalties. Andrew Reynolds revealed in September 2014 that all of the skateboarders who appeared in the first game of the series were well-paid: > So for the first game, everybody got paid. Elissa Steamer, myself > [Reynolds], whoever else was in it, we were laughing—we got like one check > for royalties that was like [US]$190,000 or something. We were like what! > This is amazing! ... I really love that Elissa Steamer got $190,000 out of > it too [laughs] that's my favorite part. Personal life As of September 2012, Steamer resides in San Francisco, CA, California with her dog Randy. In a June 2014 interview with Thrasher magazine's radio show, Steamer stated that she identifies as bisexual and, at the time, was in a relationship with her girlfriend Sofia. Steamer explained in the June 2014 radio interview that she purchased property in Fort Myers, Florida, during her skateboarding career and her property portfolio is overseen by a manager. According to the radio interview, Steamer's life in California is facilitated by her property investment.

Thought blocking and thought insertion are also terms developed by the mental health system and professionals to define a phenomenon describing a technique used with so- called \\"synthetic telepathy\\" operations. The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines. World Health Organization. . Retrieved 16 December 2010. The person experiencing thought insertion will not necessarily know where the thought is coming from, but makes a distinction between their own thoughts and those inserted into their minds. However, patients do not experience all thoughts as inserted; only certain ones, normally following a similar content or pattern. This phenomenon is classified as a delusion. A person with this delusional belief is convinced of the veracity of their beliefs and is unwilling to accept such diagnosis.Xavier Francisco Amador; Anthony S. David (2004). Insight and psychosis: awareness of illness in schizophrenia and related disorders. Oxford University Press. pp. 67–69. . Retrieved 12 December 2010. Thought insertion is a common symptom of psychosis and occurs in many mental disorders and other medical conditions. However, thought insertion is most commonly associated with schizophrenia. Thought insertion, along with thought broadcasting, thought withdrawal, thought blocking and other first rank symptoms, is a primary symptom and should not be confused with the delusional explanation given by the respondent. Although normally associated with some form of psychopathology, thought insertion can also be experienced in those considered nonpathological, usually in spiritual contexts, but also in culturally influenced practices such as mediumship and automatic writing. Some patients have also stated that at some point in time they were being manipulated by an exterior or interior force depending on the delusion that the patient faced and only later realized that thoughts weren't theirs, this is linked to patients \\"losing control\\" of what they do. Examples of thought insertion: > She said that sometimes it seemed to be her own thought 'but I don't get the > feeling that it is'. She said her 'own thoughts might say the same thing', > 'but the feeling isn't the same', 'the feeling is that it is somebody > else's.' > I look out the window and I think that the garden looks nice and the grass > looks cool, but the thoughts of Eamonn Andrews come into my mind. There are > no other thoughts there, only his [sic]. He treats my mind like a screen and > flashes thoughts onto it like you flash a picture. > The subject has thoughts that she thinks are the thoughts of other people, > somehow occurring in her own mind. It is not that the subject thinks that > other people are making her think certain thoughts as if by hypnosis or > psychokinesis, but that other people think the thoughts using the subject's > mind as a psychological medium. Unbidden thoughts Unbidden thoughts are thoughts that come to mind without the subject directly or consciously meaning to think them. Inserted thoughts, while sharing the characteristic of unconsciously or indirectly being conjured, are distinct from unbidden thoughts because of the author of the thoughts. During an experience of unbidden thinking, the subject knows that they are the author of the thought even though they may not have consciously meant to think it. During the feeling of thought insertion, however, the subject feels as though the thought belongs to another person and was inserted into their own mind, making the author of the thought someone other than themselves. Auditory verbal hallucinations Auditory hallucinations have two essential components: audibility and alienation. While people who experience thought insertion do share the experience of alienation (they cannot recognize that the thoughts they are having are self-generated) with auditory hallucinations, they lack the sense of audibility (experiencing the thoughts as occurring outside of their mind or spoken to them). The person experiencing thought insertion recognizes that the thought is being thought of inside their mind, but they fail to recognize they are the one thinking it. Theories=Standard approach The \\"standard approach\\" is characterized by a lack of sense of agency. Most philosophers define a sense of agency as a subject's awareness that they are initiating or controlling one's own actions. According to standard approach theory, the subject does not have an awareness that they are the initiators of a thought, but they do recognize that they own the thought in that it exists within their own mind. Many have argued that the standard approach does not explain the details and the unusual pathology behind thought insertion. Typically, critiques argue that this account fails to provide a reason that distinguishes inserted thoughts from either ordinary thoughts that the subject did not deliberately try to conjure (unbidden thoughts) or other thoughts that are thought to be controlled by forces outside of the subject. As a result, other theories of thought insertion have been proposed in order to try to explain the complexities behind the phenomenon. Causal-contextual The causal-contextual theory of thought insertion focuses on a lack of a feeling of ownership. This theory differs from the standard approach because rather than explaining thought insertion by saying the subject lacks a sense of agency, this model explains thought insertion by theorizing that the subject lacks a sense of ownership, which in turn creates a lack of agency. Patients with schizophrenia are hypothesized to have a generalized deficit in their integration of information, illustrated through the many other symptoms of schizophrenia and psychosis. According to causal-contextual theory, sense of ownership depends on integrating causal- contextual information and a deficit in this process account for the abnormal experience of thought insertion. This model has come under criticism due to its definition of sense of ownership. In philosophy, a sense of ownership is defined as a thought that occurs within the space of one's own mind. However, in the causal-contextual model of thought insertion, sense of ownership is defined as feeling as if a thought belongs to the person thinking it. Because of this distinction, many (e.g. Seeger, Coliva, etc.) argue that the causal- contextual model is not a separate model of thought insertion, but rather a corollary of the standard approach. Mind-to-mind paradigm Swiney and Sousa (2013) conducted an experiment to investigate thought insertion in a normal population. They attempted to create situations in which nonpathological populations would have the ability to make sense of agency misattributions in their thoughts. Participants were told that they were attached to a machine that could \\"transfer thoughts\\" from one person to another. They were then told a target word, and were to click a mouse every time they thought about the target word. However, they were only to click the mouse when they believed the target word they were thinking of was not generated by their own mind. It was stressed that the paradigm did not always work and that it was okay to not experience another person's thoughts. The vast majority (72%) of participants made at least one misattribution of agency, meaning they attributed a thought they experienced as belonging to the other participant and believed the machine had transferred the thought into their mind through the machine. This occurred after only 5 minutes. These misattributions were more frequent when the target thought was an arousing negative thought as compared to a neutral control. Neurology Identifying brain regions associated with thought insertion has proven difficult. First, it is difficult to find subjects who experience thought insertion frequently. Second, it is difficult to do brain imaging techniques on these subjects while they are experiencing thought insertion. Therefore, most of the findings in this field come from cases of normal people under hypnosis, as evidenced in an experiment by Walsh and colleges (2015). The supplementary motor area is thought to be involved in the phenomenon of thought insertion. Thought insertion is associated with reduced activation of networks that support language, movement, and self-related processing. Specifically, thought insertion is associated with a reduction in the activity of the left supplementary motor area, basal ganglia, striatal areas, right superior occipital cortex and thalamus. An altered functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area and brain regions involved in language processing and movement implementation was also found. Theory of misattributed inner speech According to the model of misattributed inner speech, during the generation of inner speech, speech production areas fail to inhibit the speech perception area and this leads to a misattribution of one's thoughts to an external source. Comparator-model (forward model) The comparator-model, also known as the forward model, is an elaboration of theory of misattributed inner speech. This theory relies on a model involved in inner speech known as the forward model. Specifically, the comparator-model of thought insertion describes processing of movement-related sensory feedback involving a parietal-cerebellar network as subject to feedforward inhibition during voluntary movements and this is thought to contribute to the subject feeling as though thoughts are inserted into his or her mind. It has been proposed that the loss of sense of agency results from a disruption of feedforward inhibition of somatosensory processing for self-generated movements. Frith (2012) argues that delusions and hallucination are associated with a failure in the predictive component of the model. Critics of this model argue that it makes the unsupported claim that a model for movement can be transferred to account for thoughts. These critics argue that this jump cannot be made because it is not known that movements and thoughts are processed in the same way. Support for the comparator-model has also been spotty. In an experiment done by Walsh and colleges (2015), the theory behind the forward model of thought insertion was not supported. They found that thought insertion was not associated with overactivation of somatosensory or other self-monitoring networks that occurs in movement. They argue that this provides evidence that a model for motor agency cannot explain thought agency. Executive control model The executive control model argues that thought insertion may be mediated by altered activity in motor planning regions, specifically the supplementary motor area. In one experiment, reduced connectivity between the supplementary motor area and motor implementation regions during suggested involuntary compared to voluntary movements was observed. Treatment Most of the treatments for thought insertion are not specific to the symptom, but rather the symptom is treated through treatment of the psychopathology that causes it. However, one case report considers a way to manage thought insertion through performing thoughts as motor actions of speech. In other words, the patient would speak his thoughts out loud in order to re-give himself the feeling of agency as he could hear himself speaking and then contributing the thought to himself.

There are 2,241 inhabitants in the municipality, absolute majority of which are Croats at 97.4%, with the largest minority being Romani at 1% of the municipality. Beside the Roman Catholic majority, there are Hungarian and Croatian Lutherans that have a tradition beginning in the 16th century. History Due to its favorable geographical position, Legrad became a chartered market town as early as 1488. Since the mid-16th century, fortifications have been built to protect the town from Ottoman incursions. By the 17th century, Legrad was a major trading post for cattle which attracted merchants from Venice and Italy. The highly profitable cattle trade, run by the Zrinski family, was used to finance their standing army and the defense against the Ottomans. The development of trade and handicrafting contributed to the demographic growth, and in 1771 Legrad and neighboring villages were recorded as having as many as 6,039 inhabitants. Cattle fairs in Legrad held their relevance into the 18th and 19th centuries. Legrad got a railway station on the other side of the river Drava in Hungary in the second half of the 19th century and that the name of this train station was Légrád until a few years ago (see: Serbian- Hungarian Baranya-Baja Republic). It is historically very important that Novi Zrin was near Legrad. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Legrad was part of the Zala County of the Kingdom of Hungary.

His mother was Godgifu, the daughter of King Æthelred the Unready and his second wife Emma. His father was Drogo of Mantes, Count of the Vexin, who died on pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1035.Ann Williams, ‘Ralph , earl of Hereford (d. 1057)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, Ralph Retrieved 25 October 2011. Ralph came to England with his uncle, the future King Edward the Confessor, in 1041. He attested three charters as earl in 1050, and his earldom was probably located in the East Midlands, where the lands of his wife Gytha were located. He was a benefactor of Peterborough Abbey. When King Edward quarrelled with Earl Godwin in 1051, Ralph raised the levies of his earldom to support the king. Godwin and his sons were forced into exile, but they returned the following year, and Ralph and Earl Odda commanded the fleet raised to resist them, but they were unable to prevent their return in triumph. Later in 1052 Godwin's son Sweyn died on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and it was probably at this stage that Ralph was given Sweyn's earldom of Hereford, which included Oxfordshire. In 1055 Ælfgar, the earl of East Anglia, was exiled and allied himself with the ruler of Wales, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Ralph met them in battle on 24 October, but suffered a disastrous defeat, and the invaders sacked Hereford. It was later claimed that Ralph and his Frenchmen started the rout, resulting in his insulting nickname, 'The Timid'. Godwin's son, Harold, the future king, then chased the invaders back into Wales. Ralph died in his early thirties on 21 December 1057, and was buried in Peterborough Abbey. Ann Williams suggested that Ralph probably lost his earldom to Harold after his defeat in 1055, but in the view of Frank Barlow he held it until his death.Barlow, The Godwins, p. 83. Ralph's son Harold was one of the royal children brought up by King Edward's wife, Edith.Stafford, p. 269. Ralph was on good terms with the Godwins, and his son may have been named after the future king and been his godson. Harold Godwinson may have been given the earldom of Hereford to hold until the Ralph's son came of age. The younger Harold survived the Conquest and later received part of his father's lands, as well as Ewyas Harold, which is named after him. His descendants are the Sudeleys of Toddington, Gloucestershire.

It is usually employed as a component of a computer vision system, in which video frames are captured in digital form and then displayed, stored, transmitted, analyzed, or combinations of these. Historically, frame grabber expansion cards were the predominant way to interface cameras to PCs. Other interface methods have emerged since then, with frame grabbers (and in some cases, cameras with built-in frame grabbers) connecting to computers via interfaces such as USB, Ethernet and IEEE 1394 (\\"FireWire\\"). Early frame grabbers typically had only enough memory to store a single digitized video frame, whereas many modern frame grabbers can store multiple frames. Modern frame grabbers often are able to perform functions beyond capturing a single video input. For example, some devices capture audio in addition to video, and some devices provide, and concurrently capture frames from multiple video inputs. Other operations may be performed as well, such as deinterlacing, text or graphics overlay, image transformations (e.g., resizing, rotation, mirroring), and conversion to JPEG or other compressed image formats. To satisfy the technological demands of applications such as radar acquisition, manufacturing and remote guidance, some frame grabbers can capture images at high frame rates, high resolutions, or both. Circuitry Analog HD frame grabber Analog frame grabbers, which accept and process analog video signals, include these circuits: * Input signal conditioner that buffers the analog video input signal to protect downstream circuitry * Video decoder that converts SD analog video (e.g., NTSC, SECAM, PAL) or HD analog video (e.g., AHD, HD-TVI, HD-CVI) to a digital format Digital frame grabbers, which accept and process digital video streams, include these circuits: * Digital video decoder that interfaces to and converts a specific type of digital video source, such as Camera Link, CoaXPress, DVI, GigE Vision, LVDS, RS-422, or SDI Circuitry common to both analog and digital frame grabbers: * Memory for storing the acquired image (i.e., a frame buffer) * A bus interface through which a processor can control the acquisition and access the data * General purpose I/O for triggering image acquisition or controlling external equipment  Applications = Healthcare  Frame grabbers are used in medicine for many applications including telenursing and remote guidance. In situations where an expert at another location needs to be consulted, frame grabbers capture the image or video from the appropriate medical equipment so it can be sent digitally to the distant expert.  Manufacturing  \\"Pick and place\\" machines are often used to mount electronic components on circuit boards during the circuit board assembly process. Such machines use one or more cameras to monitor the robotics that places the components. Each camera is paired with a frame grabber that digitizes the analog video, thus converting the video to a form that can be processed by the machine software.  Network Security  Frame grabbers may be used in security applications. For example, when a potential breach of security is detected, a frame grabber captures an image or a sequence of images, and then the images are transmitted across a digital network where they are recorded and viewed by security personnel.  Personal Use  In recent years with the rise of personal video recorders like camcorders, mobile phones, etc. video and photo applications have gained ascending prominence. Frame grabbing is becoming very popular on these devices.  Astronomy & Astrophotography  Amateur astronomers and astrophotographers use frame grabbers when using analog \\"low light\\" cameras for live image display and internet video broadcasting of celestial objects. Frame grabbers are essential to connect the analog cameras used in this application to the computers that store or process the images.

The municipality has 5,976 inhabitants, with 1,071 residents in the settlement itself (2011 census). Marija Bistrica has an old Marian shrine of the Black Madonna which is a place of pilgrimage and visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year. On 3 October 1998, Pope John Paul II visited Marija Bistrica and beatified Croatian Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac in front of a crowd of 500,000 Croatians. History The first written mention of the settlement Bistrica dates back to 1209 AD, as the possession of Croatian-Hungarian king Andrew II. Documents from 1334 first mention the church of Saints Peter and Paul. Shrine The Black Madonna statue. In 1545 a local priest hid the wonder working statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Infant Jesus, which previously stood in a wooden chapel on the Vinski Vrh (Hill) nearby, within the church to save it from the Turks and took the secret of its hiding place to his grave. The statue was discovered in 1588, when according to the records bright light shone from the place where it was buried. In 1650 the statue had to be once again hidden to be rediscovered in 1684. In 1710 the Croatian parliament vowed to fund a new altar in the church, which was done in 1715. In 1731 the church was expanded and reconsecrated to Our Lady of the Snows. In 1750 Pope Benedict XIV granted plenary indulgence to pilgrims who confess and accept the Eucharist in Bistrica. From 1879-82 a new church was built in its place, designed in the style of Neo-Renaissance by Hermann Bollé. Arcades were constructed around the church decorated with 22 paintings of the miracles granted by the Blessed Virgin. During the construction a fire destroyed all of the church except the statue and the main altar. In 1923 Pope Pius XI granted the church the status of a minor basilica and in 1935 the archbishop of Zagreb Ante Bauer crowned the statue as Our Lady Queen of Croatia. As archbishop, Aloysius Stepinac paid special attention to the site and made annual pilgrimages. On 8 July 1945 he led his last pilgrimage to Marija Bistrica which drew 40,000-50,000 people.Akmadža, Miroslav.

The village of Carden consists of Higher Carden and Lower Carden. The parish includes Carden Hall (or Carden Old Hall) and Lower Carden Hall Because the civil parish is small, it shares a parish council with a number of other small civil parishes, which, in the case of Carden are Aldersey, Barton, Clutton, Coddington, and Stretton under the name of Coddington and District Parish Council. (). Etymology Carden is derived from the Old English word Carrworðign that means 'enclosure at a rock'. The element worðign is relatively common in the region, while the only other local occurrence of carr is in the form Bedestonecarre recorded for Bidston Hill on the Wirral Peninsula in 1303. This type of name is difficult to date. It and could have formed at any time between the seventh century and when it was first recorded as Kauerthin in 1230. Family name Carden (formerly Cawarden) family name; according to Ormerod \\"at some point before the reign of Henry III (i.e., before 1216) a family assumed the local name Carden.\\" About 1450 a daughter of William de Cawarden married John Leche of Chatsworth, Derbyshire, who thereby acquired Lower Carden Hall and its lands in Cheshire. History=Celtic Carden Artefacts have been found which date back to around 12,800 to 12,000 BC (Upper Palaeolithic period) and were made by the first people to return to Britain at the end of the last glaciation. Nearly 10,000 pieces of chert and flint have been recovered from a site near the village. These include tools (and a great deal of waste material) which conform to the Mesolithic \\"narrow blade\\" tradition, and can be dated c 6800–4300 BC.The Carden Project Website; accessed: 31 March 2013. There is evidence of continual Celtic occupation and Bronze Age pottery, dating from about 2200–1800 BC, was found: pots from a Beaker period were found in 1998 and burnt human bone were found. Medieval Carden Carden is not recorded in Domesday Book, as it was probably treated as part of Tilston. In 1066, Tilston had been part of the possessions of Edwin, Earl of Mercia (1065–70), and was evidently already subdivided, as the Bishop claimed half a hide of the manor and, after the Norman conquest, another half hide was sublet to Ranulf Mainwaring. In 1066, the four hides of taxable arable land paid £6, making it one of the most prosperous Cheshire manors. Eight plough-teams could be accommodated on this land; one was in demesne. The recorded population consisted of four villeins, two bordars, four radmen, a reeve, a smith, a miller and two slaves who shared four ploughteams; the mill was worth eight shillings. The manor is described as being one league long and one wide (about 2.4 by 2.4 km); this is reasonable enough for the east-west measurement, but only acceptable for the north-south dimensions if the township of Horton Green is not included. The origins of a separate manor of Carden are obscure. The descents of the manors through the Middle Ages are complicated by their division into six parts through the coheiresses Leuca, Margaret and Ellen Caurthyn. By 1419×20 Isabel, daughter and heiress of John Beston and widow of Sir Robert Aston held lands in Carden. Her interests in Carden derived from her paternal grandmother, Isabel, daughter of Cecily, heir of John Codinton, presumed descendant of Leuca and Robert Codinton. Two years later Isabel, now married to Sir John Caryngton, obtained more lands in Carden, Farndon, Cuddington, Clutton and elsewhere from Ralph de Beston. Richard Caurthyn granted his brother William a quarter of Clutton in a charter attested by Robert Stutevile; this may have been the origin of the division of the manor. William's descendants continued to hold land in Carden throughout the Middle Ages, although the failure of one branch of the male line in the reign of Henry IV (1399–1413) brought the manors into new families. His daughter and coheir Eleanor was married to John Leche III, claimed by some to have been a younger brother of the Leche family of Chatsworth, and the manor of Nether Carden was vested in her. The Leche family had held property in Carden as early as 1346×7, when Eva Warin released land to John Leche I and his wife Lucy, her sister. Their son, John Leche II, is said to have been surgeon to Edward III and given Castle Warin and other lands in County Kildare. Carden Hall descended through thirteen generations of John Leches (although not always father to son), until a William Leche held the manor at the start of the nineteenth century, after which it descended through another three John Leches. The earliest mention of Carden Hall can be dated to 1570×1, when an inquisitio post mortem of John Leche VIII (who died 21 June 1569) states that he died \\"seised of a capital messuage called the Hall of Carthen\\". The construction of the Hall which survived until 1912 probably took place after this date, during the lordship of John Leche IX or John Leche X. On 12 June 1643, Carden Hall was plundered by a detachment from the Parliamentary garrison of Nantwich and took the owner, John Leche X, away with them as a prisoner. The most picturesque incident during this period was recorded in a handbill published in 1810, which recorded the life of John Harris, known as 'The English Hermit'. The broadsheet makes a great deal of John Harris's piety, and a recent account claims that he preached in the local villages, which seems unlikely given his decision to retire from the company of other human beings. The manor of Over Carden passed to a younger branch of the Fittons of Bollin by the marriage of Isabel, daughter of William Caurthyn to Thomas Fitton. It remained in the hands of the Fitton family until after 1662, when Owen Fitton was recorded there. Towards the end of the seventeenth century it was sold to the Bradshaws, both families endowing a charity to support a parochial school at Tilston. It later passed to Joseph Worrell, who disposed of it in several lots and the manor passed to the Leche family of Carden Hall, reuniting the two manors under the name Lower Carden. What is now known as Lower Carden Hall became a farmhouse; it survives as a much-restored seventeenth-century building, although the name, somewhat confusingly, does not refer to the manorial residence as it was the manor house of Over Carden. Modern Carden Since the Hall burnt down in 1912 (allegedly after someone dropped a lit cigarette at a party), the fortunes of the Park have undergone a number of changes of fortune. The Leche family moved to Stretton Hall and the estate was acquired by a leisure company in the 1980s and subsequently developed as a countryside leisure facility including an eighteen-hole golf course, a golf academy, hotel accommodation and a restaurant. It was originally hoped that, had Manchester's bid to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000 been successful, some of the events (such as archery and shooting) would have been held at Carden, attracting considerable sums of money. Following the failure of Manchester's Olympic bid, the company that owned the estate sold it on to St David's Hotels, Ltd. They built a second golf course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, and a much larger hotel and spa facility. As of 1 September 2014, Carden Park Golf Resort and Spa is an independent hotel. More recently a new Carden Hall has been erected on the site of the house burnt down in 1912. Completed in 2004 at a reputed cost in excess of £8m, it is a generic modern interpretation of a classic Georgian design.

Childhood Nelly was the daughter of John Parke Custis and Eleanor Calvert Custis. Her father was the only surviving child of Daniel Parke Custis and his widow, Martha Dandridge Custis, who married George Washington in 1759. She was also the granddaughter of Benedict Swingate Calvert, illegitimate son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, whose mother may have been a granddaughter of George I. He was certainly descended from Charles II through the King's daughter by Barbara Villiers, Charlotte FitzRoy. Nelly was most likely born at Mount Airy, her maternal grandfather's estate in Prince George's County, Maryland, although local tradition holds that she was born at Abingdon, her father's estate in Arlington, Virginia (now the site of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport). Following the premature death of John Parke Custis in 1781, Nelly and her brother, George Washington Parke Custis, were informally adopted by the Washingtons, and grew up at Mount Vernon. During George Washington's presidency, Nelly helped entertain guests at the first presidential mansion on Cherry Street in New York City, the second presidential mansion on Broadway in New York City, and the third presidential mansion in Philadelphia. Marriage, death, and burial Woodlawn Plantation, Fairfax County, Virginia (1805) On February 22, 1799, Nelly Custis married George Washington's nephew, the widower Lawrence Lewis, of Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Washingtons' wedding gift was adjacent to Mount Vernon, on which the Lewises built Woodlawn Plantation. The Lewises had eight children, five of whom did not survive to adulthood. The three who did survive were: *Frances Parke Lewis Butler (1799–1875) *Lorenzo Lewis (1803–1847) *Mary Eliza Lewis Conrad (1813–1839) Upon her marriage, Nelly Lewis inherited about 80 slaves from her father's estate. Her grandfather, Daniel Parke Custis's estate was liquidated following Martha Washington's death in 1802, and Nelly Lewis inherited about 35 \\"dower\\" slaves from Mount Vernon. Following the death of her mother in 1811, the John Parke Custis estate was liquidated, and she inherited approximately 40 additional slaves.Henry Wiencek, An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003), p. 383n. About 1830 the Lewises moved to Audley plantation in Clarke County, Virginia. Beginning in the mid-1830s they began dividing their time between Virginia and their daughters' homes in Louisiana. Nelly Custis Lewis continued to live at Audley after her husband's death in 1839. Throughout her life, she regarded herself as a preserver of George Washington's legacy. She shared memories and mementos, entertained and corresponded with those seeking information on the first president, and verified or debunked stories. A shaft to the east of the Washingtons' tomb at Mount Vernon marks her burial site.(1) (2) References=Sources * Brady, Patricia. Martha Washington: An American Life.

History The sunset behind the lighthouse looking up from the beach. On December 1, 1875, the Currituck Beach Light was completed, located between Cape Henry Light and Bodie Island. Unlike its fellows, Currituck Beach Light was not painted, leaving its brick facade visible. In 1939, the lighthouse was automated following a merger of the United States Coast Guard with the Bureau of Lighthouses.History: THE CURRITUCK BEACH LIGHT STATION. The Outer Banks Conservationists (OBC) performed much of the reconstruction and refurbishing work since 1980 through private funding and volunteer work. Since 1991 visitors have been allowed to climb the original 220 steps to the outdoor gallery. Access to the lens room is not permitted as the first order lens is not only the original lens, but it is still a functioning one. The light comes on every night and shines from at 20-second intervals to warn ships hugging the chain of barrier islands along the coast. In 2003, the Federal Government granted OBC the title to the lighthouse itself. The Coast Guard approved OBC's ownership proposal over that of an application submitted by Currituck County (the county in which the lighthouse is located). Through state and federal legislative maneuvering, the county sued OBC to try to acquire the property. The case was finally settled in 2006. OBC remains the owner of the Currituck Beach Lighthouse. Facts View from the top of the lighthouse Looking down the steps from the top of the tower *Number of steps: 220 *Height to focal plane of lens: *Height to top of roof: *Number of bricks: one million *Thickness of wall at base: *Thickness of wall at parapet: *Position: south of the Cape Henry (Virginia) Lighthouse; north-northwest of Bodie Island Lighthouse *Coast Survey Chart: 36° 22'36\\" N latitude, 75° 49'51\\" W longitude. Currituck Beach Light, ca. 1883 As it had reported in previous years, the U.S. Light-House Board in 1872 stated that ships, cargoes, and lives continued to be lost along the of dark coastline that lay beyond the reaches of existing lighthouses. Southbound ships sailing closer to shore to avoid the Gulf Stream were especially in danger. In response, construction began on the Currituck Beach Lighthouse in 1873 with completion two years later. The date at the top of the entrance to the lighthouse says \\"1873\\" because on every lighthouse, the date on the structure is the date that construction began. The Currituck Beach Lighthouse is a first order lighthouse, meaning it has the largest of seven Fresnel lens sizes. The original source of light was a Funck's hydraulic float lamp, fueled with lard oil, and consisting of four concentric wicks. In approximately 1884, the lighthouse converted to a mineral oil (kerosene) lamp with five concentric wicks; the largest was 4 inches in diameter. By 1913, an incandescent oil vapor lamp was used, with kerosene vaporized and forced into the burner by use of a hand pump attached to the storage tank. Before the advent of electricity, a mechanical means was required to rotate the huge lenses that made the light appear to flash. A system of weights suspended from a line powered a clockwork mechanism beneath the lantern—much like the workings of a grandfather clock. The keeper cranked the weights up by hand every two and a half hours. In approximately 1939, the lighthouse was completely automated. The Coast Guard took over the duties and responsibilities of the United States Lighthouse Board, and the lighthouse had computerized devices installed which turned the light on automatically. Four 1000 watt bulbs were installed in the light room, however only one flashed at night (the other three served as back-up emergency replacements, which would automatically start if one bulb went out.) Because the lighthouse was automated, the keepers were no longer needed to tend to the lighthouse, and all lighthouse keepers on the compound were dismissed from their duties. Like the other lighthouses on North Carolina's Outer Banks, this one still serves as an aid to navigation. The beacon comes on automatically every evening at dusk and ceases at dawn. With a 20-second flash cycle (on for 3 seconds, off for 17 seconds), the light can be seen for . The distinctive sequence enables the lighthouse not only to warn mariners but also to help identify their locations. The original four-bulb light system has been replaced with only two light bulbs, as the lights now last longer than they did in 1939. (The lights remain 1000 watts, and the Coast Guard replaces them.) (The lights last about a year per bulb.) Meghan Agresto, Site Manager, Currituck Beach Lighthouse. Phone 252-453-8152. The Currituck Beach Lighthouse was the last major brick lighthouse built on the Outer Banks. Sand Island Light (Alabama) was built in 1873 using the same plans as Currituck Beach Light, but with a second order Fresnel lens.

History  Crescentwood was developed by noted Winnipeg real estate agent C. H. Enderton. The original Enderton development included a major portion of Crescentwood and a small corner of River Heights. In 1904, Enderton laid out Yale, Harvard, Kingsway and Dromore Avenues. He also purchased lots to create Oxford Street and the east side of Waverley north to Wellington Crescent. All the property on the river side of Wellington Crescent from Grosvenor Avenue to just beyond Elm Street in River Heights was his as well. Many of the wealthiest residents moved into the new neighbourhood from 1904 until the 1913 recession. The remaining lots sold as the economy recovered. Today, Crescentwood remains a middle-class neighbourhood adjacent to River Heights. Enderton was born in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1864, and after his university training worked as a lawyer in St. Paul, Minnesota. He came to Winnipeg in 1890 and made a success of his career in real estate. His many memberships and board positions showed him to be a prominent citizen of his adopted city. He remained a bachelor, living in a suite at the Fort Garry Court. On the day of his death he had been driving with a lady friend around Assiniboine Park. He was struck by a heart attack while returning along Academy Road. When C. H. Enderton died in 1920, he left an estate of $1,200,000. This was the largest estate probated in Manitoba since the death of Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona, in 1914. After remembering some charities in Winnipeg, such as the Children's Hospital, he left the residue of his estate to his alma mater, Depauw University, although it was admitted at the time that his assets consisted largely of real estate which were not readily marketable. Wellington Crescent was once an Indian trail following the curves of the Assiniboine River. In 1893 it was named Wellington Street after lawyer Arthur Wellington Ross who came from Cornwall, Ontario and purchased land in Fort Rouge.

At the 2011 census the town proper had a population of 2,622, while the administrative area – which also includes four nearby villages – had 4,345 inhabitants. 66% of population were ethnic Croats while the biggest minority group were Istrian Italians (10%).  History  There was an ancient city in the broad area of what is now Novigrad, which was called Aemona. In the 5th-6th centuries Novigrad was called Neapolis (Greek Νεάπολις). From the early Middle Ages and right up until 1828 it was the seat of the Diocese of Novigrad, which has been identified with the Ancient see of Aemona and nominally restored as Latin Catholic titular see under both names. From 1270 it was under the rule of the Venetian Republic, which gave it the Italian name of Cittanova, until Venice fell in the late 18th century.

Related models  This may be contrasted with an equilibrium climate simulation in which greenhouse gas concentrations are suddenly changed (typically from pre-industrial values to twice pre-industrial values) and the model allowed to come into equilibrium with the new forcing.  History  Early GCMs used \\"swamp\\" or \\"slab\\" ocean models for reasons of computational simplicity. Such models cannot simulate the heat take up that occurs in the real ocean and were thus unable to run transient simulations: instead, the response to equilibrium change was investigated. There are problems with this approach, which were well appreciated at the time: the deep ocean has a very long time constant and in some areas (most notably the southern ocean) the transient and equilibrium responses are very different.  Model interpretation issues  In an equilibrium simulation, time is merely a label and a given year or decade does not represent the simulation of a calendar year or decade. * Thus (by definition) a portion of a simulation labelled \\"2000-2030\\" represents 30 years, but not any particular 30 years. * In a transient simulation, instead of a sudden change in greenhouse gases and other forcings, the forcings are changed gradually, either in an idealised way (1% increase, for example) or a more realistic fashion (one of the scenarios described in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios). If the simulation is partly of the past, observed levels may be used (and perhaps solar variation, and volcanic forcing). The transient simulation is intended to be a physically plausible path for the climate system to follow. Although (given natural variability) even a perfect model would not simulate the year-to-year variations seen in the real world, in an ideal model the variation from decade to decade would track that of the real world. thumb  External links  Related websites * Enhanced Greenhouse Climate, Transient Climate Simulations Category:Numerical climate and weather models ","title":"Transient climate simulation"},{"id":"3561650","text":"Mexicali Shmoes is a 1959 Warner Bros.

In his 22–year reign from 1606–1628, Anaukpetlun completed the reunification efforts begun by his father, King Nyaungyan. Having inherited a partial kingdom comprising mainly Upper Burma and the Shan States from his father, Anaukpetlun went on to reconquer Lan Na in the east, and in the south, Lower Burma from rival Burmese factions and the Portuguese, as well as the Upper Tenasserim from the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The kingdom was known as the Restored Taungoo Kingdom or Nyaungyan Dynasty. Family Officially styled as Maha Dhamma Yaza, Anaukpetlun was a grandson of Bayinnaung. Both of his parents were children of Bayinnaung, half-brother and half-sister.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 42 In November 1605, Nyaungyan died after a military campaign to Hsenwi. Anaukpetlun then inherited the Kingdom of Ava that included all north of Bagan along the Irrawaddy River and the cis-Salween Shan States. Anaukpetlun pursued his campaigns to unify the Burmese kingdom. In 1608, he took Prome (modern Pyay), installing his brother Thalun as the King of Prome. In 1610 he took Taungoo from Natshinnaung and forced the king to swear loyalty. However, Filipe de Brito e Nicote, the Portuguese ruler of Syriam (modern Thanlyin) marched to Taungoo and captured Natshinnaung.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co.

He was able to counter the Rakhine fleets and took the port of Syriam in 1613, though Nat Shin Naung had already died. Anaukpetlun took the European-Portuguese captives to Ava and Bago, where they were known as Bayingyi and served as gunners for the Burmese armies later. In 1617, Anaukpetlun decided to make Bago the capital of his dominions and crowned himself as King of Bago that year. In 1613–1614, Anaukpetlun attacked Dawei, Tenasserim and Chiang Mai but was repelled. In 1618 Siam and Burma reached an agreement in which Burma would control Mottama and Thailand would control Chiang Mai. In 1624, Anaukpetlun sent his brother Thalun to curb the rebellion of Chiang Saen and Nan. Anaukpetlun was murdered in 1628 by his son Minyedeippa, who had a relationship with one of Anaukpetlun's concubines and feared the possible punishments.

In Thousands Cheer (1943), he appeared with Kyser and sang \\"I Dug a Ditch\\", and he also appeared as a vocalist in That's Right—You're Wrong (1939), You'll Find Out (1940), and Playmates (1941). The origin of Merwyn Bogue's stage name, Ish Kabibble, can be traced back to the 1913 novelty song \\"Isch ga-bibble\\" and this 1915 cartoon postcard, which displays a spelling (Ish Ka Bibble) almost identical to that used by Bogue. Between the song and the card, in 1914, Harry Hershfield introduced his character Abie Kabibble in his comic strip Abie the Agent. In his 1989 autobiography, Bogue explained his stage name, which he took from the lyrics of one of his comedic songs, \\"Isch ga-bibble.\\"\\"Ishkabibble (I should worry)\\", Music by George W. Meyer, Words by Sam M. Lewis, Geo. W. Meyer Music Co., 1913. The song derived from a mock-Yiddish expression, \\"Ische ga bibble?\\", which was purported to mean \\"I should worry?\\", prompting a curious (and perhaps not coincidental) association with the \\"What, me worry?\\" motto of Mad Magazine's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman. While this derivation has been widely quoted on the Internet and elsewhere, the expression \\"ische ga bibble\\" is not Yiddish and in fact contains no Yiddish words at all. However, there is a Yiddish expression, \\"nisht gefidlt,\\" meaning \\"it doesn't matter to me,\\" from which the term \\"ish kabibble\\" may derive. Although Bogue's stage persona was that of a dumb person, he was a notable cornet player and was also business manager for the Kay Kyser Orchestra from 1931 to 1951. With the decline of the big bands, Bogue found a new career in real estate. By 1973, he was living in Hawaii, causing double-takes from prospective clients who saw his trademark haircut and read his business card: \\"Ish Kabibble, Sales Manager\\". Personal life Bogue married Janet Meade in 1932, and the couple had three children: Merwyn (known as Peter), born 1937; Pamela, 1940; and Janet, 1941, according to the book Ish Kabibble: The Autobiography of Merwyn Bogue (1989), co-written by Bogue and his sister, Gladys Bogue Reilly. Bogue died in 1994 in Joshua Tree, California, of respiratory failure brought on by pulmonary disease and emphysema. Cultural legacy Kabibble's distinctive black hair in a bowl cut, similar to that used by Three Stooges member Moe Howard, is said to have been an inspiration for the hairstyle worn by Jim Carrey's character in Dumb and Dumber. The name \\"Ish Kabbible\\" was used for a hoax student supposedly enrolled at Princeton University in the 1950s. Around 1983, Ish Kabibble was the voice recording for the animated series Challenge of the GoBots. This predecessor to the more popular Transformers series also had humans allied with both sides of feuding mechanical extraterrestrials. One example was Soviet Russian scientist Dr. Anya Turgenova. Towards the end of the pilot episode, she muttered, \\"Ishkabibble!\\" in boredom after hearing her friends' summoned to a U.S. federal government inquiry. In 1985, the character's name was used as a plot device on the animated series The Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby-Doo when Scooby and the gang, along with an animated spoof of Vincent Price, go in search of the Amulet of Ish Kabibble. In the TV show M*A*S*H, Alan Alda's character Hawkeye Pierce several times refers to Ish Kabibble. Once Pierce asks whom he and Trapper John should drink to--\\"MacArthur or Ish Kabibble?\\" Another time he refers to Ish Kabibble and his All-Girl Orchestra and refers to him as part of a dream. In the TV show Green Acres, Sam Drucker sells \\"Ish Kabibble\\" kazoos. In the \\"Cousin Maude's Visit\\" episode of All in the Family, Maude refers to how the name \\"Ish Kabibble\\" makes Archie Bunker laugh, in an automatic juvenile response. In the animated sitcom Sit Down Shut Up, Ish Kabbible is referred to several times in one episode. In the movie Photographing Fairies, Ish Kabbible is used a few times as a toast. A children's book, \\"Ishkabibble!\\" by Dorothy Crayder, with art by Susan Vaeth was published in 1975. The word in the book is a nonsense motivational term, and is revealed to translate as \\"who cares?\\" as in the alleged etymology from above. The academic society known as The International Society for History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology goes by the acronym ISHPSSB, but the abbreviation is commonly pronounced ″ishkabibble″ at the suggestion of David Hull, as an homage to Bogue. Kay Kyser and Ish Kabibble are caricatured as Kaynine Kyser and Ish Kyoodle in the Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon \\"Hollywood Canine Canteen.\\" Ish Kabibble recited a poem (\\"Roses are red / Violets are blue / If skunks had a college / They'd call it P.U.\\").

Arms of Brady Brim-DeForest, current owner of Balvaird Castle. Balvaird Castle (also spelled as Balverd Castle or Balverde Castle or Balwaird Castle or Baleward Castle) in Perthshire is a particularly fine and complete example of a traditional late medieval Scottish tower house. It is located in the Ochil Hills, around south of Abernethy. The name Balvaird is from Baile a' Bhàird, 'Township of the Bard' in Gaelic. Balvaird Castle is a scheduled monument, and is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. Origins Balvaird was built around the year 1500 for Sir Andrew Murray, a younger son of the family of Murray of Tullibardine. He acquired the lands of Balvaird through marriage to the heiress Margaret Barclay, a member of a wealthy family. It is likely that Balvaird Castle was built on the site of an earlier Barclay family castle. Substantial remnants of earthwork fortifications around the Castle may survive from earlier defences.  Additions and later history  Over the years the castle was extended and altered. A gatehouse was built in 1567. An outer courtyard was attached to the main gate which possibly contained stabling as well as adding an extra layer of defence to the castle. Another courtyard to the south was a garden, while a much larger walled area to the north-east was an orchard or 'pleasance.' The family continued to live at Balvaird until they were elevated to the Viscountcy of Stormont (ancestors of the Earldom of Mansfield) and in 1658 moved to the rather more comfortable Scone Palace, near Perth. Thereafter the castle continued to be inhabited, though not by the family itself. In its later days, it probably accommodated farm workers. The Castle was restored and partially excavated in recent years by Historic Scotland, by whom it is maintained, although it was owned by the Murray family until 2017. The site is open at all times, but the tower-house itself can only be visited on a restricted number of days every year. Balvaird Castle is the caput of the feudal Lordship and Barony of Balvaird and is currently owned by American entrepreneur, Brady Brim-DeForest.  Architecture  Balvaird is notable among Scottish castles of its date for its refined architectural detail. Features include corbels in the form of carved heads supporting the corner- roundels of the wall-walk, an unusually elaborate aumbry (wall-cupboard) in the first-floor hall and a cap-house above the stair in the form of a miniature tower-house. It has been suggested that some or all of these carved stone features may have been brought to Balvaird for re-use from an ecclesiastical building.

Prior to this appointment, Kennard was Managing Director of the global private equity firm the Carlyle Group. He was also chairman of the FCC after being appointed by President Bill Clinton in November 1997, serving from November 3, 1997 to January 19, 2001. He is also an advisor for the transatlantic think-tank European Horizons. Early life and education Kennard is a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School. Biography=Carlyle group Prior to becoming Ambassador, Kennard was Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with over $100 billion under management. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group in May 2001, where he led investments in the telecommunications and media sectors. Work with the FCC Before his appointment as FCC Chairman, Kennard served as the FCC's general counsel from 1993 until 1997. He joined the FCC from the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand (now DLA Piper) where he was a partner and member of the firm's board of directors. Before joining The Carlyle Group, Kennard served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from November 1997 to January 2001. He presided over the agency at an historic time. During his tenure, he shaped policies that created an explosion of new wireless phones, brought the Internet to a majority of American households, and resulted in billions of dollars of investment in new broadband technologies. At the same time, he implemented bold new policies to bridge the digital divide in the United States and around the world. Kennard is well known for his advocacy for people at risk of being stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. He implemented the FCC's e-rate program, which brought the Internet to almost every school and library in the United States. Under Kennard's leadership, the FCC dramatically expanded access to communications technologies for people with disabilities. The FCC also adopted policies to increase telephone service to rural areas, especially to Native Americans living on tribal lands. He reached out to create more ownership and employment opportunities for women and minorities. As FCC chairman, Kennard promoted the benefits of technology worldwide. He pioneered an innovative FCC Development Initiative to assist countries in the developing world to participate more fully in the global growth of digital technology. Through this initiative, Kennard signed the first partnership agreements on behalf of the FCC with ten countries on four continents to share U.S. regulatory experience with emerging regulatory authorities. U.S. News & World Report dubbed Kennard a \\"consumer champion for the digital age.\\" He has received many honors and awards for his accomplishments, including honorary degrees from Howard University, Gallaudet University and Long Island University and awards from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the Easter Seals Foundation, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

Kennard FCC.gov including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the European Council, and the European External Action Service. He also strengthened ties and encouraged dialogue with the increasingly powerful European Parliament. During his time in Brussels, Ambassador Kennard made reinvigorating the U.S.-EU economic relationship and eliminating regulatory barriers his top priorities. He was a key force behind the February 2013 decision to launch negotiations on an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which aims to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic and contribute to the development of rules that will strengthen the multilateral trading system. He also worked to revitalize the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) so that it could better fulfill its mission of promoting economic growth through increased trade and job creation. Ambassador Kennard helped cement close U.S.-EU coordination on a range of common foreign policy priorities, including the Balkans, Libya and the transitions in the Middle East, and the adoption of historic non-proliferation sanctions against Iran and North Korea. He worked to ensure that the EU \\"pivoted\\" with the U.S. when it came to dealing with Asia and integrating emerging powers into the global system. He was a tireless advocate of the need for the EU and U.S. to work out compatible data privacy regimes in a manner that protects the personal data of citizens while facilitating the flow of commerce and allowing for effective law enforcement cooperation. He was also the first U.S. Ambassador to the EU to actively engage with European audiences through social media.

Williams is best known for having served as Tiger Woods' caddie from 1999 to 2011. Woods was the top-ranked golfer in the world for much of Williams' tenure as his caddy. Career Williams was born in Wellington. He began his career of caddying at his home club at age 6. By age 10, he was frequently caddying 36 holes on Saturday and Sunday and then practicing his golf game until dark, becoming a two-handicap by age 13. However, as he reports on his official site, \\"by the age of thirteen I found myself enjoying caddying more than playing.\\" He received his first break as a caddie in 1976, when his father arranged for him to carry the bags of Australian great Peter Thomson in the New Zealand Open. Thomson, who finished third, was impressed with the young Williams, who became his regular caddie when he played in New Zealand. The teenaged Williams also traveled to Australia on school breaks to caddie in tournaments there. In 1979, before he turned 16, he left school and moved to Europe to become a caddie on the European Tour. Williams spent much of the next decade caddying on almost all of the world's major professional tours. He got steady work with several Australian pros, among them Ian Baker-Finch. During this time, he met Greg Norman, and in 1982 became Norman's regular caddie in all his events in Asia and Australia, as well as some European events. In 1988, Williams moved to the United States to become Norman's full- time caddie. However, Norman fired him in 1989. Williams said later that he had gotten too close personally to Norman. Nonetheless, the two remained good friends. Norman later said he had made a mistake and tried to rehire him several years later. Williams had not long stayed unemployed, as Raymond Floyd hired him shortly after Norman fired him. He continued to carry Floyd's bag on both the regular and senior U.S. tours until 1999. Tiger Woods Early in the 1999 season at the Doral - Ryder Open, Tiger Woods' then-coach Butch Harmon approached Williams, asking if he would be interested in caddying for Woods, who had just fired his original tour caddie, Mike \\"Fluff\\" Cowan. Harmon had previously asked Raymond Floyd's permission to talk with Williams. After the event, Williams drove to Orlando to interview with Woods, who hired him on the spot. In the 2006 Ryder Cup singles match, Williams slipped while trying to clean Woods' 9 iron during the 7th hole, and ended up dropping it into the water. The club was later retrieved by a diver, and handed back to Woods on the 15th hole. Woods and Williams' relationship extended beyond the golf course, as Woods attended Williams' wedding in New Zealand in 2005 and has attended many of Williams' dirt track races. Williams has been known to aggressively defend Woods from overbearing fans on the course. At one event, he wrestled a $7,000 camera from a fan who clicked a picture of Woods during his backswing and threw it into a pond. Adam Scott Woods fired Williams and announced this publicly on 20 July 2011. Williams had caddied for Adam Scott in the 2011 U.S. Open and 2011 Open Championship. Williams released the following statement on his official website: > \\"Following the completion of the AT&T; National I am no longer caddying for > Tiger after he informed me that he needed to make a change. After 13 years > of loyal service needless to say this came as a shock. Given the > circumstances of the past 18 months working through Tiger's scandal, a new > coach and with it a major swing change and Tiger battling through injuries I > am very disappointed to end our very successful partnership at this time. I > have had the opportunity to work of late for Australian Adam Scott and will > now caddy for him on a permanent basis. Having started my caddying career > with Australian great Peter Thompson and working for Greg Norman in the '80s > I am excited about the future working for another Australian.\\" After his win alongside Adam Scott at the 2011 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, Williams, in an interview with David Feherty on CBS, said \\"I've caddied for 33 years — 145 wins now — and that's the best win I've ever had.\\" The following day he expressed regret for the remarks, noting they were \\"over the top\\" and saying, \\"I had a lot of anger in me about what happened (with Woods) and it all came out.\\" It is estimated he earned $12 million working for Woods. With Williams as his caddie, Scott finished runner-up at the 2012 Open Championship, having led by four strokes with four holes to play before bogeying them all to lose the title by one stroke to Ernie Els. The following year Scott won the Masters, defeating Ángel Cabrera on the second playoff hole. It was Scott's first major championship and the first time that an Australian golfer had won the Masters. In September 2017, Williams announced that he would no longer be working in his part-time role with Scott, saying Scott wanted to go back to having a full-time caddie from the start of 2018 onwards. He spent the 2017 New Zealand Women's Open on the bag of Danielle Kang. Controversy During an event in New Zealand in December 2008, Williams made news for comments about Phil Mickelson. According to British newspaper The Guardian he said, \\"I wouldn't call Mickelson a great player, 'cause I hate the prick\\". In a next-day interview with another newspaper, the New Zealand-based Star Times, Williams also said, \\"I don't particularly like the guy. He pays me no respect at all and hence I don't pay him any respect. It's no secret we don't get along either.\\" On 4 November 2011, Williams made a comment that was perceived by some as being racist towards Tiger Woods. When asked about the comments he made after Adam Scott's win at Bridgestone, he replied: \\"It was my aim to shove it right up that black arsehole\\". Williams made an apology soon after. Tiger Woods then said Steve Williams is \\"certainly not racist.\\" Other interests Williams' investiture as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit by the governor-general, Anand Satyanand, in April 2008 In 2001, Williams started a charitable foundation to assist junior golfers in his homeland. This charitable involvement was cited in his appointment as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to youth sport and recreation, announced on 4 June 2007 in the 2007 Queen’s Birthday Honours. In his free time, Williams also indulges a long-time passion for Speedway Racing, and races a Saloon car and a Super Saloon regularly during the speedway season. He was the national Super Saloon car champion for 2005/2006.Speedway Archive He won the coveted Saloon Car title for the 2009/2010 season. Williams gave NZ$1 million to a cancer ward at Starship Children's Health in 2008.

Looney Tunes short directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on February 25, 1956, and stars Bugs Bunny. The short is notable for being June Foray's first project for Warner Bros., which led to her voicing other Looney Tunes characters such as Granny, as well as her first time working with Jones, who she continued to collaborate with after Warners' closed their animation department. Plot Witch Hazel, who is about to make Bugs Bunny the final ingredient in her witch's brew. It is Halloween night, and Witch Hazel is concocting a batch of witch's brew. As she goes about her business, she pauses at her magic mirror and asks it who is the ugliest one of all. The genie in the mirror replies that she, Witch Hazel, is the ugliest one of all. Hazel explains to the audience that she is \\"deathly afraid\\" of getting prettier as she grows older, a fear that she initially just laughs off. Meanwhile, Bugs Bunny is out trick-or-treating dressed as a witch, his face hidden by an ugly green mask. He calls on Witch Hazel, who, seeing his costume, mistakes him for an actual witch (\\"I don't remember seeing her at any of the union meetings.\\"). After making a comment about Bugs' appearance (\\"Isn't she the ugliest thing?\\"), she dashes to her magic mirror and asks it a second time who is the ugliest one of all. The genie in the mirror looks towards Bugs, also thinks that he is a witch and replies that he actually finds Bugs far uglier. The jealous witch then hatches a plot: she invites the disguised Bugs in for tea, and prepares a potion containing an assortment of beauty enhancers. Bugs is about to drink the tea when he remembers that he is still wearing his mask and takes it off. Seeing that her \\"rival\\" is a rabbit, Witch Hazel dashes off to consult her cookbook. Sure enough, one of the ingredients for the brew she was making earlier is a rabbit's clavicle. While she is gone, Bugs suspects that there is trouble afoot and makes to leave, but he is stopped by Witch Hazel brandishing a meat cleaver. Bugs flees, with the cackling witch chasing him throughout the house. During the chase, Hazel dashes to her magic broom closet to grab her flying broomstick to keep up with Bugs, but instead mounts her sweeping broom by accident; the broom starts sweeping the floor with her clinging to it until she lets go (\\"Crazy me, that was my sweeping broom!\\"). As Bugs hides, Witch Hazel finally traps Bugs using a carrot on a fishing rod. Back at her cauldron, Hazel prepares to kill Bugs and use him in her potion. She is about to bring her cleaver down on the trussed-up rabbit, but he plays to her sympathies, gazing back at her with tear-filled doe eyes. Overcome with mercy, Witch Hazel bursts into tears, saying his innocent face reminds her of Paul, her pet tarantula. Bugs tries comforting her by bringing her the cup of beauty elixir disguised as tea, which she unknowingly drinks. Hazel instantly changes into a well-contoured redheaded beauty (a caricature of what Hazel's voice actress, June Foray, looked like at the time) as Milt Franklyn strikes up \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" in the background. Horrified of her new form, Hazel dashes to her magic mirror a third time and meekly asks the genie (in a much more gentle and dulcet tone; again, Foray's natural voice) if she is still ugly. Upon seeing Hazel's new appearance beyond recognition, the genie gives a very Bob Hope-like \\"ROWR, ROWR!\\", immediately falling in love with her. Hazel jumps back horrified from the genie as he lunges out of the mirror to grab her, she then is able to flee him on her flying broomstick—unfortunately, the genie soon starts chasing after her on his flying carpet and slowly catches up to her. Bugs (still tied on the rope except his arms), who is still at Hazel's house, promptly calls the local air raid headquarters to report \\"a genie with light brown hair chasin' a flying sorceress!\\".

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Rudolf Ising of Harman and Ising. The short was released on August 2, 1931, and stars Foxy, a character who appeared in three 1931 shorts.  Overview  Lady, Play Your Mandolin The cartoon features Foxy as a gaucho who decides to visit a local saloon. His horse soon finds himself drunk on tequila and begins to hallucinate wildly. Similarly to Foxy, the cartoon features a female fox character that is very reminiscent of Minnie Mouse. As was typically the case with the early entries in the Merrie Melodies series, one purpose of the cartoon was to promote a Warner-owned popular song. The title theme, written by Oscar Levant with lyrics by Irving Caesar, was a 1930 #5 pop hit sung by Nick Lucas and released by Brunswick Records, which had been purchased by Warner Bros. the previous year (Another recording, by the Havana Novelty Orchestra was released the same year on RCA's Victor Records). In the short, it is sung by a female fox character who would later become Foxy's girlfriend, Roxy. The credited animators were Rollin \\"Ham\\" Hamilton and Norm Blackburn (plus uncredited animation by Isadore Freleng, Robert Clampett (his first cartoon at WB according to some sources) and Carman Maxwell) with a musical score and direction of the Abe Lyman (Brunswick Recording) Orchestra by Frank Marsales. Rudolf Ising provides the voice of Foxy while Harman-Ising regular Rochelle Hudson as well as Abe Lyman (and probably members of his band) provide the other voices.  Availability  The cartoon is available as an extra on the Little Caesar DVD and Blu-ray. It is also available on the DVD 'Attack of the '30's Characters', albeit in an unrestored form. Like the post-1948 Warner Bros. cartoon library, it is the only Looney Tunes cartoon that was never sold to Sunset Productions nor Associated Artists Productions, presumably because of its alcohol-related subject matter. It is also the only Looney Tunes cartoon not available on TNT in the 80s, nor Cartoon Network but available on Cartoon Network's sister channel, Boomerang until the late 2000s.

Wilson served under Percy Cox, the colonial administrator of Mesopotamia (Mandatory Iraq) during and after First World War, including the Iraqi revolt against the British in 1920. Wilson was the third Member of Parliament to die in action in the Second World War. He was killed while serving as an aircrew member at the advanced age of 55. Early life and career Wilson was born in 1884 and educated in England at Clifton College, where his father James Wilson was a headmaster. His elder half-sister was the leading civil servant Mona Wilson and his younger brother was the tenor Sir Steuart Wilson.Elaine Harrison, 'Wilson, Mona (1872–1954)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 9 March 2017 Wilson (aka \\"A.T.\\") was tall and strong. He began his military career as an army officer 19 August 1903, having been awarded the King's Medal and sword of honour at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, being commissioned on the Unattached List for the British Indian Army. After he spent a year attached to the 1st battalion the Wiltshire Regiment in India, he was appointed to the Indian Army and posted to the 32nd Sikh Pioneers, on 18 December 1904.April 1905 Indian Army List Wilson famously saved money travelling back to Britain on leave by working as a stoker to Marseilles and then cycling the rest of the way. In 1904 he went to Iran as a Lieutenant to lead a group of Bengal Lancers to guard the British consulate in Ahvaz and to protect the work of the D’Arcy Oil Company, which had obtained a sixty-year oil concession in Iran and was pursuing oil exploration in partnership with the Burmah Oil Company. In 1907 Wilson was transferred to the Indian Political Department and sent to the Persian Gulf, where he served as a political officer. Wilson oversaw the discovery of the first oil site in the Middle East, Masjid-i-Suleiman in 1908. Soldier and senior administrator as Consul-General of Muhammerah (1909–11), he was put in charge of the Turko- Persian Frontier Commission.Townshend, When God Made Hell, p. 281 He looked like the traditional figure of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in a top buttoned bright red tunic, the Indian Army uniform. \\"His flashing eyes, his beetling eyebrows, his close-cropped hair, his biblical quotations\\", recalled Gertrude Bell, the British \\"Oriental Secretary\\".Townshend, pp. 281–2 Wilson was a hard worker, a workaholic, who was tirelessly energetic, shifting mountains of paperwork. He inspired a younger colleague, Harry Philby, while Hubert Young, a favoured subordinate, found him domineering. First World War In January 1915, as the British were moving troops from India into Mesopotamia through the Persian Gulf and Basra, Wilson was designated as the assistant, and then deputy, to Sir Percy Cox, the British Political Officer for the region. Based in Baghdad, he then became the acting Civil Commissioner for Mesopotamia. The problem remained that there was no official \\"Arab Policy\\"; it had not been defined in law nor by the Civil Service. India wanted Mesopotamia as a Province; but Arabists from Cox downwards wished for a semi-autonomous policy separate from the Arab Bureau in Cairo. Policy was made ad hoc; but Wilson disagreed. During his tenure in Mesopotamia Wilson worked to improve the country's administration according to the principles he learned in India. In Wilson's view the priority was to reconstruct and stabilise the country, by establishing an efficient government and administration as well as a fair treatment and political representation of the various ethnic and religious communities (i.e. in the case of Iraq: Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, of religions such as Islam Shiite and Sunni, Christianity and Judaism). In doing so, he was nicknamed \\"The Despot of Mess-Pot\\". > Capt Wilson told me the staggering news that he had been appointed to Tehran > ...Capt Wilson and I are excellent colleagues and the best of friends and I > know I can do a good deal by seeing people...I am going to compile an > intelligence book on Persia.Gertrude to Florence Bell, Baghdad, August 30th, > 1918, Letters## (ed.), I, p.461 However, after the First World War he found himself progressively opposed to other British officials who believed that Arab countries should be granted independence under British supervision. British policymakers debated two alternative approaches to Middle Eastern issues. Many diplomats adopted the line of thought of T. E. Lawrence favoring Arab national ideals. The back the Hashemite family for top leadership positions. Wilson expressed the views of the India office. They argued that direct British rule was essential, and the Hashemite family was too supportive of policies that would interfere with British interests. The decision was to support Arab nationalism, sidetracked Wilson, and consolidate power in the Colonial Office.Timothy J. Paris, \\"British Middle East Policy-Making after the First World War: The Lawrentian and Wilsonian Schools.\\" Historical Journal 41.3 (1998): 773-793 online.Timothy J. Paris,Britain, the Hashemites and Arab rule: the sherifian solution (Routledge, 2004).Robert McNamara, The Hashemites: the dream of Arabia (2010). Post World War One In 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, he was among the few who successfully recommended adopting the Arabic name Iraq, as it had been known for more than 1400 years by Muslim and Arab worlds, instead of the Greek name Mesopotamia which was only used by Westerners.[citation needed] This political entity covered the planned northern expansion of the newly created country under the British Mandate to include the oil rich Mosul region of Northern Iraq, in addition to the Mesopotamian provinces of Baghdad and Basra. In April 1920, at the Conference of San Remo, the League of Nations agreed to the British mandate over Iraq. In the spring and summer of 1920 various riots erupted across central and southern Iraq. These riots were often violently repressed by Wilson's administration. The total number of Iraqi casualties of these riots was estimated at 10,000 people.Eli Amarilyo, \\"History, Memory and Commemoration: The Iraqi Revolution of 1920 and the Process of Nation Building in Iraq.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 51.1 (2015): 72-92. Having achieved the rank of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in August 1918, he retired from the Indian Army in August 1921.Supplement to the Indian Army List January 1939 In the summer of 1920 Wilson proposed a compromise, suggesting that Feisal, the former King of Syria, be offered the Iraqi throne. This proposal was intended to obtain support from the Iraqis as well as British officials who favored semi-independence. It was eventually accepted by the British government, but Wilson was not there to participate in its implementation. The British government decided not to follow Wilson's views, and instead granted independence to Iraq. The British government removed Wilson from his position in Iraq and knighted him. Deeply disappointed by the turn of events, he left the public service and joined the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as manager of their Middle Eastern operations. He worked for the company until 1932. Interwar decades Across the 1930s Wilson undertook a great number of extracurricular activities, such as chairman of the Parliamentary Scientific Committee (forerunner of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee), an active role in the British Science Guild, the British Eugenics Society, the Industrial Health Research Board, and many more.Michael Weatherburn, 'Arnold T. Wilson, the New Victorians and the Forgotten Technocrats of Interwar Britain' (Imperial College MSc thesis, 2009).

Politics In 1933 Wilson was elected in a by-election as the Conservative MP for Hitchin. He described himself as a 'left-wing radical Tory'.Marlowe, John, Late Victorian: the life of Sir Arnold Talbot Wilson (1967) Like his half-sister Mona Wilson, Wilson published extensively on what he termed 'left wing' issues such as workmen's compensation, the costs of funerals, industrial assurance, and old age pensions. These researches arguably influenced related postwar policies.Farmer, Ann, By their fruits: eugenics, population control, and the abortion campaign c2008 Before the Second World War his outspoken views on foreign policy evoked much criticism. In 1938 Wilson expressed support for the Spanish Nationalists, saying \\"I hope to God Franco wins in Spain, and the sooner the better.\\"Margaret George,The Hollow Men: An Examination of British Foreign Policy Between the Years 1933 and 1939. London, Frewin, 1967. (p. 149) The New Statesman described him as \\"an admirer of Hitler and an unscrupulous propagandist for Mussolini and Hitler\\". George Orwell called him a Fascist, although he also praised his courage and patriotism.George Orwell, The Complete Works of George Orwell, Volume 16 (1986) Second World War However, in October 1939 after the outbreak of the war, he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, serving as a pilot officer (air gunner) in 37 Squadron of RAF Bomber Command. He stated that \\"I have no desire to shelter myself and live in safety behind the ramparts of the bodies of millions of our young men.\\" Still an MP, he was killed in northern France, near Dunkirk, on 31 May 1940 when the bomber he was serving on as an air gunner, Wellington L7791, piloted by Pilot Officer William Gray crashed near Eringhem, killing him instantly and fatally wounding Gray. He is buried at Eringhem churchyard, half-way between Dunkirk and Saint-Omer.

Government and nonprofit A CAO is responsible for administrative management of private, public or governmental organizations and the de facto head of the organization. In a municipal context, the title is usually used as an alternative for city manager, county administrator, or county executive, particularly in cases where the position does not include powers such as the authority to appoint or dismiss department heads. In the United Kingdom, CAOs of public companies must be chartered secretaries (Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators), lawyers, certified/chartered accountants, or others with equivalent experience. Non- government corporations The CAO is one of the highest-ranking members of an organization, managing daily operations and usually reporting directly to the chief executive officer. In some companies, the CAO is also the president. It is very similar to a chief operating officer but is not the same as a chief executive officer, which is a more senior title in for-profit corporations. It is typical for a company that does not manufacture a physical product to have a CAO in place of a COO, particularly in technology organizations. United Nations At the United Nations, the secretary-general is the de facto head of the United Nations. According to the United Nations: Equal parts diplomat and advocate, civil servant and CEO, the secretary-general is a symbol of United Nations ideals and a spokesman for the interests of the world's peoples, in particular the poor and vulnerable among them. The charter also empowers the secretary-general to \\"bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\\". These guidelines both define the powers of the office and grant it considerable scope for action. One of the most vital roles played by the secretary-general is the use of his \\"good offices\\", steps taken publicly and in private, drawing upon his independence, impartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising, escalating or spreading.

Such vessels share a nearly identical hull and superstructure layout, similar size, and roughly comparable features and equipment. They often share a common naming theme, either being named after the same type of thing (places, constellations, monarchs) or with some kind of alliteration. Typically the ship class is named for the first ship of that class. Often, sisters become more differentiated during their service as their equipment (in the case of naval vessels, their armament) are separately altered. For instance, the U.S. warships , , , and are all sister ships, each being an . Perhaps the most famous sister ships were the White Star Line's s, consisting of , and . As with some other liners, the sisters worked as running mates. Other sister ships include the Royal Caribbean International's and . Half-sister refers to a ship of the same class but with some significant differences. One example of half-sisters are the First World War-era British s where the first two ships had four guns, but the last ship, , had two guns instead. Another example is the American s of the Second World War that came in \\"long-hull\\" and \\"short- hull\\" versions. Notable airships include the American sister ships and , and the German Hindenburg class airship's Hindenburg and Graf Zeppelin II.

Publication history Attuma first appeared in Fantastic Four volume 1 #33 (1964), and was created by Stan Lee (writer) and Jack Kirby (artist). Fictional character biography Attuma was born as a member of a tribe of barbaric Atlanteans, who were banished from Atlantis ages ago. For unknown reasons Attuma was born with strength, endurance, and speed far superior to those of any normal Atlantean. Attuma quickly became leader of his tribe and declared that he would conquer the city of Atlantis as an ancient prophecy predicted.

However, his strength, stamina, resistance to physical injury, and swimming speed are much higher than the majority of his race. Like most Atlanteans, Attuma could not survive out of water for more than 10 minutes without the aid of mechanical devices or certain chemicals, for most of his life. His stamina, agility, and reflexes also were reduced when out of the water. Like all Atlanteans his specially developed vision allows him to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. After certain genetic and surgical enhancements following his resurrection at the hands of Doctor Doom his strength has been fortified to be on par with the strength of Namor as well as granting him the ability of self-propelled flight and living on land unaided. Attuma is a skilled Atlantean warrior, trained in the use of many different weapons. He is an expert hand-to-hand combatant, especially underwater, and has achieved mastery in the use of most Atlantean weapons.

Vormela is from the German word , which means \\"little worm\\". The specific name peregusna comes from (), which is Ukrainian for \\"polecat\\". Marbled polecats are generally found in the drier areas and grasslands of southeastern Europe to western China. Like other members of Ictonychinae, it can emit a strong- smelling secretion from anal sacs under the tail when threatened.  Description  Pocock's The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma - Mammalia Vol 2 Skull of a marbled polecat Ranging in length from 29–35 cm (head and body), the marbled polecat has a short muzzle and very large, noticeable ears. The limbs are short and claws are long and strong. While the tail is long, with long hair, the overall pelage is short. Black and white mark the face, with a black stripe across the eyes and white markings around the mouth. Dorsally, the pelage is yellow and heavily mottled with irregular reddish or brown spots. The tail is dark brown with a yellowish band in the midregion. The ventral region and limbs are a dark brown. Females weigh from 295 to 600 g, and males can range from 320 to 715 g.  Distribution  The marbled polecat is found from southeast Europe to Russia and China. Its range includes Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Asia Minor, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Afghanistan, north-western Pakistan, Yugoslavia, Mongolia, China, Kazakhstan, North-Siberian Altai steppes. In 1998, a marbled polecat was recorded on the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt.  Behavior  Marbled polecats are most active during the morning and evening. Their eyesight is weak and they rely on a well- developed sense of smell. Vocalization is limited and consists of shrill alarm cries, grunts and a submissive long shriek. Marbled polecats are solitary and move extensively through their 0.5- to 0.6-km2 home range. They generally only stay in a shelter once. When they encounter each other, they are usually aggressive. When alarmed, a marbled polecat will raise up on its legs while arching its back and curling its tail over the back, with the long tail hair erect. It may also raise its head, bare its teeth, and give shrill, short hisses. If threatened, it can expel a foul-smelling secretion from enlarged anal glands under the tail. To dig, such as when excavating dens, the marbled polecat digs out earth with its forelegs while anchoring itself with its chin and hind legs. It will use its teeth to pull out obstacles such as roots.  Reproduction  Marbled polecats mate from March to early June. Their mating calls are most often heard as low rumbling sounds in a slow rhythm. Gestation can be long and variable (243 days to 327 days). Parturition has been observed to occur from late January to mid-March. Delayed implantation allows marbled polecats to time the birth of their cubs for favorable conditions, such as when prey is abundant. Litter sizes range from four to eight cubs. Only females care for the young. Cubs open their eyes at around 38–40 days old, are weaned at 50–54 days and leave their mother (disperse) at 61–68 days old.  Ecology =Habitat Marbled polecats are found in open desert, semidesert, and semiarid rocky areas in upland valleys and low hill ranges, steppe country and arid subtropical scrub forest. They avoid mountainous regions. Marbled polecats have been sighted in cultivated areas such as melon patches and vegetable fields. Burrows of large ground squirrels or similar rodents such as the great gerbil (Rhombomys opinus) and Libyan jird are used by marbled polecats for resting and breeding. They may also dig their own dens or live in underground irrigation tunnels. In the winter, marbled polecats will line their dens with grass.  Diet  Marbled polecats are known to eat ground squirrels, Libyan jirds (Meriones libycus), Armenian hamsters (Cricetulus migratorius), voles, mole rats (Spalax lecocon ehrenbergi), house mice (Mus musculus), and other rodents, small hares, birds, lizards, fish, frogs, snails, and insects (beetles and crickets), as well as fruit and grass. They are also recorded as taking small domestic poultry such as chickens and pigeons, as well as stealing smoked meat and cheese.  Conservation status  In 2008, V. peregusna was classified as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List due to a population reduction of at least 30% in the previous 10 years. In 1996, it had been considered a species of least concern. The decline in marbled polecat populations thought to be due to habitat destruction (cultivation) and reduction in available prey by use of rodenticides. In Pakistan, it is listed as an endangered species. From a research done on the Marbled Polecat, data revealed that from the West to the East, there was a gradual decrease in morphological diversity of the polecat skulls. Thus giving us Western and Eastern as a factor to diversify the polecats. Also, the data related to the range formation of the species rather than climate change. Relation with humans Pelts of various marbled polecat subspecies. The marbled polecat was once sought for its fur, generally known as \\"fitch\\" or more specifically, \\"perwitsky\\" in the fur trade. In 1945, Kabul shopkeepers were reported to have kept marbled polecats to exterminate rodents. Their journals also show some developed an adverse reaction to the strong smell they emit when threatened. Side effects varied from fever to diarrhea. Other names for the marbled polecat include aladzhauzen (Turkmen), berguznya (Kuban), chokha (Kalmuck), fessyah (\\"stinky\\" in Arabic), abulfiss (Arabic), (Chinese , ‘tiger musteline’), myshovka (Terek Cossacks dialect), pereguznya, pereguzka, or perevishchik (Ukrainian), perevyazka (Russian), perewiaske (Polish), khaytakis (Armenian), alaca sansar, alaca kokarca, benekli kokarca (Turkish), suur-tyshkan (Kyrgyz), or (French); (German, ‘tiger polecat’), mottled polecat (English), sarmatier; Syrian marbled polecat, and tiger polecat. In some contexts it is called the tiger weasel.

St David's Hall is the National Concert Hall and Conference Centre of Wales. It hosts the annual Welsh Proms and the biennial BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition. As well as classical music it also plays host to jazz, soul, pop, rock, dance, children's, rhythm and blues, musicals and other forms of world music, as well as light entertainment artists. The foyers in the centre are open and have regular free performances from music groups. The foyers, balconies and bar areas are also used to host art exhibitions. History= Planning and Construction  Credit is given to the Conservative leader of Cardiff City Council, Ron Watkiss, for bringing St David's Hall to fruition. A bronze bust of him is on display in the foyer of the building. Architects Seymour Harris Partnership had the task of fitting a major 2000 seat, acoustically perfect auditorium, with surrounding dressing rooms, bars, foyers, a restaurant, offices and spacious concourse into a cramped city centre space. The space available was so cramped that they had to fit the complex into and on top of an already planned and partly built St. David's Shopping Centre. As a result, they had to use every inch of space available and the building has an unusual shape. The main contractor was John Laing & Son.Ritchie, p. 166 It held its first concert on 11 September 1982. It was officially opened over 5 months after the first concert on 15 February 1983 by the Queen Mother, followed by a concert by the Welsh Symphony Orchestra conducted by Owain Arwel Hughes. Hughes and Watkiss later brought the Welsh Proms to the venue. The Wales Millennium Centre has added significantly to the arts and cultural scene already present in the city of Cardiff. The angular grey concrete that makes up nearly the whole visible exterior and some interior foyers looks unmistakably 1970s/1980s modernist new build; the architectural magazine Building Design described the hall's style as \\"complex late brutalism\\".  BBC NOW  BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales (BBC NOW) is the orchestra-in-residence at St David's Hall, performing regularly between September and June each year. Almost all of the orchestra’s concerts at St David’s Hall are recorded for live or deferred broadcast on BBC Radio 3, and there are dedicated recording facilities within the concert hall to facilitate broadcasts. Present day The interior of St David's Hall Major events held at the Hall include the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition held every two years and the Welsh Proms held annually. Prizes for the Welsh Artist of the Year are awarded at the venue every June, followed by an exhibition of the winners and shortlisted works. St David's Hall is continually developing its variety of shows, and has recently re- branded the L3 Lounge venue, which has a partly seated capacity of 350 and is mainly used for daytime concerts, the Roots Unearthed folk series and more recently Blas* – A Taste of the Fresh Welsh Sound.  Organ  The concert organ of St. David's Hall was completed by Peter Collins in 1982, at a cost of £168,000. This would be the largest organ he ever built. The wooden case was designed by Ralph Downes. Due to problems with the action, J. W. Walker & Sons replaced the action and console, a great embarrassment at the time considering the cost of the organ. The organ has 3 manuals, and German-style continental registrations. The main auditorium of St. David's Hall is regularly host to organ events, including lunchtime concerts. Many organists travel to try out the organ, and others come to give recitals, notably Olivier Latry, Anne Marsden Thomas, Ghislaine Reece-Trapp, and Margaret Phillips. St. David's Hall has also hosted concerts for major organ events such as the 2019 RCO OrganFest.

History Under the Habsburg Monarchy, Rijeka and the surrounding area technically belonged to the Hungarian half of the Monarchy. Sušak was a municipality separate from the city of Rijeka and since the nineteenth century it experienced faster urbanization and population growth. In 1924, Rijeka belonged to the independent Free State of Fiume, which had been created four years earlier under the Treaty of Rapallo, but in the Treaty of Rome the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes and Italy agreed to dissolve the free state. Instead Fiume was annexed to Italy as the Province of Fiume, and Sušak remained with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (also called Yugoslavia), but with joint administration of the port facilities.Penfield Roberts, \\"Italy\\", in An Encyclopedia of World History (1940), Boston: Houghton Mifflin, Section VI, B, 6, b, p. 988. On 1 February 1948 elections for the City Councils in Rijeka were held, thus creating the foundations for joining Rijeka and Susak.

History Hill fort in Trsat district. In the time before the Illyrians there was a fortified settlement and then the Illyrian (Iapydic) fortress Tarsatica. Following this there was a Roman looking point, and from the 13th century it was the property of the Counts of Krk. Later it belonged to the Frankopans. Together with Vinodol, the Croatian-Hungarian King Andrija II presented Trsat to Vid II of Krk. Towards the end of the 15th century the Habsburgs ruled Trsat and, even though it belonged to Croatia and the Frankopans, would not give it up because of its excellent position for the protection of Rijeka. The inhabitants of Trsat and Rijeka waged their fiercest battles with the Venetians in 1508, while in 1527 the Turks made inroads into the city for a short time. In the 16th century, Trsat was more often in Habsburg than in Frankopan hands, and was mainly ruled by the Captains of Rijeka or Senj or leaseholds. After the execution of Fran Krsto Frankopan in 1671 following the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy proposed by Petar Zrinski, the Habsburgs took Trsat over completely. It was attached for a short time to the state of Severin, and in 1778 Maria Theresa placed it under the municipality of Bakar, where it remained, with a short break during the Napoleonic wars, until 1874 when the community of Trsat was founded.Radovan Radovinovič, The Croatian Adriatic, pg. 78, Zagreb (1999), Trsat was an extremely patriotic Croatian town, and, together with Sušak, demonstrated its attachment to its mother country at every opportunity, and its independence from Rijeka, which was part of Hungary. The centre of political and cultural life in Trsat was the Croatian Reading Room, founded in 1877, with many cultural, educational and sports societies. Many memorial inscriptions and monuments bear witness to the resistance by the people of Trsat and Sušak to Italian and German occupation, a mortuary made according to plans by the architect Zdenko Sila and Zdenko Kolacio being outstanding. Important sights=Trsat Castle Trsat Castle - detail. It stands on the site of an old Roman fortress and was built in the first half of the 13th century by the Frankopan Princes of Krk. From the beginning of the 15th century it had a succession of lords, but was most often owned by the Habsburgs. In 1528 the Senj Capitan Gašpar Raab bought the castle and adapted and greatly strengthened it. Once the danger from the Turks had passed at the end of the 17th century, and fire arms had come into use, Trsat fortress was less important and was left allowed to fall into ruins, a process which was completed by an earthquake in 1750. Count Laval Nugent, Marshal and military commander of the Austrian coastal area, bought the ruins off the city, for an annual payment of one florint and had it restored in a Romantic Classicist-Biedermeier-style.Vesna Marić, Croatia: Dive into coral seas & a rich culture, pg. 122, Lonely Planet Publications, 5th ed. (2009), He engaged the Venetian builder Paronuzzio and repaired the towers, decorated the interior and even built himself a mausoleum in the style of a Doric temple with four marble pillars supporting the facade. After his death his impoverished descendants deserted the castle and it once again fell into ruin until 1960. Since then it has been restored and enriched by the presence of art exhibitions, summer concerts and theatrical performances. The Shrine of Our Lady of Trsat Church of Our Lady of Trsat facade Interior of Our Lady of Trsat Church of Our Lady's courtyard. The Shrine of Our Lady of Trsat () is a church on the flat area at the top of Trsat hill and the subject of a legend dating from the 13th century. In May 1291 Mary's house in Nazareth is said to have appeared here, moved by angels from Nazareth, then mysteriously disappeared later, to be discovered in Italy, in Loreto, where it still stands today as a shrine.Lovett Fielding Edwards, A Wayfarer in Yugoslavia, pg. 4, Publisher Unknown (2007), According to one version the Holy House was brought from the Holy Land by the Crusaders. Prince Nikola Frankopan sent a delegation to Nazareth to measure the foundations as he had presumably only the stones in his possession and not the whole walls. He rebuilt the Holy House and the Frankopan Family then gave the Holy House to the Pope and, as the nearest Papal lands were near Ancona, the House was shipped there and placed in Loreto.Paola Frankopan,Trsatska Sveta Kuča, Zagreb, 2003. Tradition ascribes the building of the church to Prince Nikola I Frankopan (1307-1343) in 1291; it was extended and added to by his descendants. In 1453 Prince Martin Frankopan added on a nave to house a painting of Mary, believed to have been donated by Pope Urban V in 1367William Garratt, https://books.google.com/books?id=Tr3Q8wlpHaEC&pg;=PA103&dq;=count+frangipani&hl;=cs&ei;=poaYTPyfGoaVswabmYWJDA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=2&ved;=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=count%20frangipani&f;=false Loreto the New Nazareth and Its Centenary Jubilee, pg. 33, Kessinger Publishing (2003), and thought to have been painted by Luke,Jeanne Oliver, Croatia, pg. 97-98, Lonely Planet Publications, 4th ed.

In 1644 a new nave was added to the church, which was extended and redone in Baroque style by the contributions of the members of congregation and Princes Frankopans. In 1691 the monastery was rebuilt after a fire and the complete reconstruction of the interior of the cathedral began, which was completed by the mid of the 18th century. In 1726 a new sanctuary above the crypt was built, giving the entire space luxury of ceiling decoration.Radmila Matejčić, Kako citati grad: Rijeka jucer, danas, pg. 367, Izdavacki centar Rijeka (1988), A new artistic contribution to the church was made by Vladimir Kirin (1894-1963), with five pictures on the greenish marble slabs with which the shrine is lined, and another by Ivo Režek (1898-1979) who portrayed the 14 stations of the cross in fresco technique. One of the guardians of the Trsat monastery was the outstanding Glagolitic expert and writer of books in Croatian, Latin and Italian, Franjo Glavinič (1585-1652).

There are 561 steps in all, and they were built for pilgrims on their way to the votive church. Work was started on them in 1531 by Petar Kružić, hero of battles against the Turks, who built the lower part of the stairway, later expanded to 538 steps. The Baroque entrance hall in the form of a triumphal arch was built in the first half of the 18th century, and the votive chapels on the level ground near the church by the steps, between the 15th and the 18th centuries, one chapel each century.

Rathbone was sitting with his fiancée, Clara Harris, next to the President and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, when John Wilkes Booth entered the president's box at Ford's Theatre and fatally shot Lincoln in the head. When Rathbone attempted to prevent Booth from fleeing the scene, Booth stabbed and seriously wounded him. Early life Henry Rathbone was born in Albany, New York, one of four children of Jared L. Rathbone, a merchant and wealthy businessman, who later became Albany's mayor, and Pauline Rathbone (née Penney). Upon his father's death in 1845, Rathbone inherited the very considerable sum of . His widowed mother, Pauline Rathbone, married Ira Harris in 1848. Ira Harris was appointed U.S. Senator from New York after William H. Seward became President Lincoln's Secretary of State. Harris was a widower with four children whose wife Louisa had also died in 1845. As a result of this marriage, Ira Harris became Rathbone's stepfather and his daughter, Clara, became Rathbone's stepsister. Although this unusual series of events made them stepbrother and stepsister, they were not related by blood. Rathbone and Harris formed a close friendship and later fell in love. The two became engaged shortly before the American Civil War. Rathbone studied law at Union College and briefly worked in a law partnership in Albany before entering the Union Army at the start of Civil War. During the war, Rathbone served as Captain in the 12th Infantry Regiment and was at the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Fredericksburg. By the war's end, he had attained the rank of major. Lincoln assassination On April 14, 1865, Major Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris accepted an invitation to see a play at Ford's Theatre from President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. The couple, who had been friends with the President and his wife for some time, were invited after Ulysses S. Grant and his wife Julia, Thomas Eckert, and several others had declined Mrs. Lincoln's invitation. Dagger used by Booth to attack Rathbone. During the play, at about 10:14 pm, noted stage actor John Wilkes Booth entered the Presidential box and fatally shot Lincoln in the head with a pistol. As Rathbone attempted to apprehend Booth, Booth slashed Rathbone's left arm with a dagger from the elbow to his shoulder. Rathbone later recalled that he was horrified at the anger on Booth's face.What Booth Said After He Killed Lincoln Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the sill of the box. He grabbed onto Booth's coat, causing Booth to fall awkwardly to the stage, perhaps breaking his leg, though some conspiracy theorists said that the injury did not occur until later. Booth nonetheless escaped, and remained at large for twelve days. Despite his serious wound, Rathbone escorted Mary Lincoln to the Petersen House across the street, where the president had been taken. Shortly thereafter he passed out due to blood loss. Harris arrived soon after and held his head in her lap while he lay semiconscious. When a surgeon who had been attending Lincoln finally examined him, it was realized that his wound was more serious than initially thought. Booth had cut him nearly to the bone and severed an artery. Rathbone was taken home while Harris remained with Mary Todd Lincoln as the President lay dying over the next eight hours.Kauffman (2007) p.37 This death vigil lasted through the night until morning, when Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865. Diplomatic career and mental decline Although Rathbone's physical wounds healed, his mental state deteriorated in the years following Lincoln's death as he anguished over his perceived inability to thwart the assassination attempt.\\"The Conspirator: The Plot to Kill Lincoln\\", National Geographic Channel. Retrieved March 18, 2012 He married Harris on July 11, 1867, and the couple had three children: Henry Riggs (born February 12, 1870, who later became a U.S. Congressman), Gerald Lawrence (born August 26, 1871), and Clara Pauline (born September 15, 1872). Rathbone resigned from the Army in 1870, having risen to the rank of brevet colonel. After his resignation, he struggled to find and keep a job due to his mental instability. He became convinced that Harris was unfaithful. He also resented the attention Harris paid their children and reportedly threatened his wife on several occasions after suspecting that she was going to divorce him and take the children. Nonetheless, President Chester A. Arthur appointed Rathbone as the U.S. Consul to the Province of Hanover in 1882. The family relocated to Germany, where Rathbone's mental health continued to decline. On December 23, 1883, Rathbone attacked his children in a fit of madness. Rathbone fatally shot and stabbed his wife, who was attempting to protect the children. Rathbone then stabbed himself five times in the chest in an attempted suicide. He was charged with murder but was declared insane by doctors after blaming the murder on an intruder. He was convicted and committed to an asylum for the criminally insane in Hildesheim, Germany. The couple's children were sent to live with their uncle, William Harris, in the United States. Final years and death Rathbone spent the rest of his life in the asylum. He died on August 14, 1911, and was buried next to his wife in the city cemetery at Hanover/Engesohde.

Aoife is the finest young singer that has come to my attention for quite some time. Review Excerpts Rambles: 1996, by Gilbert Head: This disc is at its best with the slower ballads, which are richly mounted, and give the best opportunity for Ní Fhearraigh to linger with the melody. The placing of the occasional countertempo piece like the question-and-answer work \\"Cailin a' tSleibhe Ruaidh\\" lends balance to the disc, and gives one a feel for the diversity of the vocal tradition from Ranafast which those who have labored in love on Aoife have sought successfully to preserve and share.

Merrie Melodies directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on September 25, 1943, and stars Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Daffy Duck. They perform a parody of Disney's Silly Symphony cartoon series and specifically his 1940 feature Fantasia. The film uses two of Johann Strauss' best known waltzes, Tales from the Vienna Woods and The Blue Danube. Plot Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is heard over the opening credits, featuring Carnegie Hall parody \\"Corny-gie Hall\\". Afterwards, a musicologist, played by Elmer Fudd (voiced by Arthur Q. Bryan) appears in an ill-fitting tuxedo and glasses, directly parodying the Deems Taylor introductions in Fantasia. He struggles against his uncooperative clothing as he delivers his introductions using his characteristic rhotacism: \\"And as we hear the whythmic stwains of the haunting wefwain, wisten to the wippwing whythm of the woodwinds, as it wolls awound and awound, and it comes out here...\\" (referencing the lyrics to the popular song The Music Goes Round and Round). The first of the two musical segments is set to Strauss' waltz Tales from the Vienna Wood. Porky Pig plays Elmer Fudd's usual role of hunter, accompanied by an unnamed hunting dog (similar to the one seen the following year in Clampett's Hare Ribbin'). Since the only spoken dialogue in the cartoon are Fudd's introductions, Porky explains what he is doing via a sign reading, \\"I'm hunting that @!!*@ rabbit!!\\", which turns out to be Bugs Bunny. A series of visual gags ensue, parodying ballet, and culminating with all three characters believing that they have been shot. After Porky and the dog realize that they are unharmed, they attempt to give first aid to the apparently fatally wounded Bugs, as the dog bawls in tune with the music. When Porky finally pries Bugs' clenched hands off the supposed gunshot wound in his chest, Bugs is revealed to have a baby blue bra underneath. Emitting a scream of modesty, Bugs caps the bra over the bewildered hunters' heads and then, wearing a tutu, gracefully dances off into the distance, falling over at the music's climax. Fudd returns briefly to introduce the second segment, Strauss' The Blue Danube waltz. This plays out as a slapstick parody of Disney's Silly Symphony cartoon, The Ugly Duckling, wherein a young Daffy Duck attempts to join the three cygnets (baby swans) who follow their mother swan, all paddling around in waltz time; the mother consistently violently rebuffs the duckling. Meanwhile, a large buzzard with a \\"hep cat\\" hairdo spots the troupe and goes \\"Out To Brunch\\" by swooping down and sprinkling salt and pepper on the cygnets. He plucks each out of the water (the last youngster is revealed to be fitted with a tiny outboard motor), then grabs Daffy, but immediately puts him back with a sign reading—as befits a World War II cartoon—\\"Rejected 4F\\" (unfit-for-military-service). Upon realizing her children are gone, the mother swan faints and, seeing the Buzzard making off with the cygnets, Daffy gets angry, takes on the aspect of a P-40 Warhawk fighter and buzzes the Buzzard, who literally turns yellow, drops the cygnets (who parachute back to the water) and flees. Daffy stuns the Buzzard then hands him a drum of TNT which blows him sky high. The buzzard is last seen gliding towards heaven (via an attached balloon) in angel garb, strumming a harp. The cartoon ends with the swan family and Daffy merrily quacking the Blue Danube as they glide across the water together. One final sight-gag occurs as Daffy's distracted reflection misses a turn, gets separated, and slams into a tree's reflection. The cartoon fades out on the birds waving goodbye as the reflection rejoins Daffy. Reception Fantasia was marketed to highbrow music fans; the Looney Tunes staff responded by violating the ivory tower of classical music and concert hall culture. A Corny Concerto parodies both Fantasia's Silly Symphonies-derived balletic approach to storytelling. Elmer Fudd stands in for Deems Taylor and in an anti-highbrow gag, his starched shirtfront keeps erupting from his shirt to hit him on the face.Goldmark (2002), p. 107-108 There are a number of visual nods to Fantasia and the Silly Symphonies, including the use of silhouetted figures as when Fudd first appears, unnaturally colored vegetation such as purple trees, and two anthropomorphic trees as seen in Disney's Flowers and Trees (1932). In 1994, A Corny Concerto was voted No. 47 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. Availability The short can be seen on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 DVD set and also appears in the documentary Bugs Bunny: Superstar. It can also be found on The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 1 laserdisc, the Looney Tunes Collectors Edition: Musical Masterpieces VHS, and Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection: Volume 2. Since most of this cartoon has fallen into public domain (with the exception of the brief quotation of “The Music Goes Round and Round”), it has made frequent appearances on many gray-market VHS and DVD cartoon releases.

In some cases, an invention's Scottishness is determined by the fact that it came into existence in Scotland (e.g., animal cloning), by non-Scots working in the country. Often, things that are discovered for the first time are also called \\"inventions\\" and in many cases there is no clear line between the two. The Scots take enormous pride in the history of Scottish invention and discovery. There are many books devoted solely to the subject, as well as scores of websites listing Scottish inventions and discoveries with varying degrees of science. Even before the Industrial Revolution, Scots have been at the forefront of innovation and discovery across a wide range of spheres. Some of the most significant products of Scottish ingenuity include James Watt's steam engine, improving on that of Thomas Newcomen, the bicycle, macadamisation (not to be confused with tarmac or tarmacadam), Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the first practical telephone, John Logie Baird's invention of television,The World's First High Definition Colour Television System. and McLean, p. 196.

London has hosted the Olympic Games in 1908, 1948, and most recently in 2012, making it the most frequently chosen city in modern Olympic history. Other popular sports in London include cricket, rowing, rugby, basketball, and most recently American Football. Olympics and Paralympics The Olympic Stadium London has hosted the Summer Olympics in 1908 at White City and 1948 at Wembley Stadium. In July 2005 London was chosen to host the Games in 2012, making it the first city in the world to host the Summer Olympics three times. London hosted the Paralympic Games in 2012, for the first time. The 2012 games saw massive development in the East End of London, particularly Stratford, which is home to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Olympic Stadium and many major venues. Other events were spread out across the city, from Wembley Stadium in the north-west to Wimbledon in the south. Commonwealth Games London hosted the second British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games) at White City Stadium in 1934. Football London has a special place in the history of football. The playing of football in London has been well documented since it was first outlawed in 1314. In the sixteenth century the headmaster of St Paul's School, Richard Mulcaster, is credited with taking mob football and transforming it into organised and refereed team football. The modern game of football was first codified in 1863 in London and subsequently spread worldwide. Key to the establishment of the modern game was Londoner Ebenezer Cobb Morley who was a founding member of The Football Association, the oldest football organisation in the world. Morley wrote to Bell's Life newspaper proposing a governing body for football which led directly to the first meeting at the Freemasons' Tavern in central London of the FA. He wrote the first set of rules of true modern Association football at his house in Barnes. The modern passing game was invented in London in the early 1870s by the Royal Engineers A.F.C..History of Football Football is now the most popular spectator sport in London, and the city has several of England's leading clubs. Most London clubs are named after the district in which they play (or used to play). Historically the London clubs have not accumulated as many trophies as those from the north-west of England, such as Liverpool and Manchester United, but at present Arsenal (founded at Woolwich Arsenal but playing in Holloway), and Chelsea (who actually play in Fulham) are regarded as two of the Premier League's \\"big four\\" alongside Manchester United and Liverpool. In 2003–04 they became the first pair of London clubs to finish first and second in the top flight, with Arsenal winning. In 2004–05 they did so again, this time with Chelsea winning. In 2009–10, three of the top four places were occupied by London sides—Chelsea (champions), Arsenal (3rd) and Tottenham Hotspur (4th). This meant that the 2010–11 season would see three London clubs in the UEFA Champions League for the first time ever. London clubs are able to charge higher ticket prices than clubs in other parts of the country (particularly for corporate facilities), and this has swung English football's balance of power towards London. Before Chelsea's recent rise in fortunes the two highest profile London clubs were Arsenal and their long- standing North London rivals Tottenham, both of whom were considered to be members of English football's \\"big five\\" for most of the post-war period. The 2020–21 Premier League features six London clubs: Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham and West Ham United. As of the 2020–21 season, there are eight London clubs in the fully professional Football League (the three divisions below the Premiership), namely AFC Wimbledon, Barnet, Brentford, Charlton Athletic, Dagenham & Redbridge, Leyton Orient, Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. There are also numerous London clubs playing outside the top four divisions of English football, one or two of which are fully professional and many of which are part-time professional. Hackney Marshes in east London, home to many amateur sides, is reportedly the single largest collection of football pitches in the world. Wembley Stadium The new Wembley Stadium during construction Wembley Stadium, in north-west London, is the national football stadium (and was also the home of Tottenham Hotspur from 2017-2019), and is traditionally the home of the FA Cup Semi-finals and Final, League Cup Final and England's home internationals. The old stadium was closed in 2000 to be demolished and completely rebuilt, and the new stadium opened in 2007. Cardiff's Millennium Stadium was the venue for FA Cup finals during the reconstruction, while England played at various venues around the country. Wembley was one of the venues for the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the 1996 European Football Championship, and hosted the final of both tournaments. It also was the venue for the European Cup final in 1968, 1978, 1992,2011 and 2013. Wembley will host the semi-finals and finals of the Euro 2020 after winning the right to host the semi-finals and finals when Germany withdrew their bid. As well as football matches, Wembley has hosted many other sporting events, including the rugby league Challenge Cup final. Other stadiums *In 2006, Arsenal moved half a kilometre to Emirates Stadium in Lower Holloway. Since 1913 the club had played at Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. Prior to 1913, Arsenal played near the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. *Barnet, promoted to Football League Two for the 2015–16 season, play at The Hive Stadium in Canons Park. *Brentford play at Griffin Park in Brentford. *Charlton Athletic plays at The Valley in Charlton. *Chelsea play at Stamford Bridge in Fulham, west of Chelsea. *Crystal Palace play at Selhurst Park in Selhurst, south of Crystal Palace. *Dagenham & Redbridge play at Victoria Road in Dagenham. *Fulham play at Craven Cottage in Fulham. *Leyton Orient play at Brisbane Road in Leyton. *Millwall play at The Den, formerly known as The New Den, in Bermondsey. The club, founded in Millwall in 1885, moved from their previous home ground in New Cross, also called The Den, in 1993. *Queens Park Rangers play at Loftus Road in Shepherd's Bush, south of Queens Park. The stadium was also used by Fulham F.C. between 2002 and 2004. *Prior to 2017, Tottenham Hotspur played at White Hart Lane in Tottenham. In 2017, Tottenham Hotspur moved to Wembley Stadium in north-west London until March 2019, when they finally moved to their new home ground Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. *In 2016, West Ham United moved to Olympic Stadium in Stratford. Prior to 2016, West Ham United played at the Boleyn Ground in Upton Park, near West Ham. *AFC Wimbledon and Kingstonian, the latter of which currently compete in the Isthmian League Premier Division, play at Kingsmeadow in Kingston upon Thames, west of Wimbledon. The stadium was originally owned by Kingstonian, but is now owned by AFC Wimbledon. Before moving to Milton Keynes, Wimbledon F.C. played at Plough Lane in Wimbledon until 1991 and then were tenants of Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park until 2003. *Hayes & Yeading United, who play in National League South, currently groundshare with Maidenhead United in Maidenhead, Berkshire whilst awaiting the completion of renovations to their own ground in the borough of Hillingdon. *Sutton United, also playing in the National League, play at Gander Green Lane, in Sutton. *Bromley, who play in the National League, play at Hayes Lane in Bromley, which is in Greater London. *Carshalton Athletic, playing in the Isthmian League Division One South, play at the War Memorial Sports Ground, in Carshalton, South London. *Dulwich Hamlet, currently in the Isthmian League Premier Division, play at Champion Hill in East Dulwich. Fisher, successor to the defunct Fisher Athletic, are their tenants. *Hampton and Richmond play at the Beveree Stadium in Hampton. *Tooting & Mitcham United play at Imperial Fields in Morden. Cricket The Pavilion at Lord's Cricket Ground London has two Test cricket grounds (a rare distinction in world cricket): Lord's and The Oval. Lord's, located in St John's Wood, is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and is also home to Middlesex County Cricket Club, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the European Cricket Council (ECC) and, until August 2005, the International Cricket Council (ICC). Lord's is widely referred to as the \\"Home of Cricket\\" and is home to the world's oldest sporting museum. The Twenty20 Cup, Minor Counties Cricket Championship and many other Championship finals are held at Lord's. The Oval in Kennington, home of Surrey CCC, became the first ground in England to host international Test cricket in September 1880. The Oval was also an important location for football: England's first international match (against Scotland) was held there in 1870, and it was the location of the first FA Cup final (in 1872), and later finals between 1874 and 1892. Cricket is very well organised and established within London, is the second most popular sport after football. Essex County Cricket Club has formerly used venues throughout London including Ilford, Leyton Cricket Ground, Romford and Billericay. Essex Eagles had agreed a deal in principle to play Twenty20 matches at Olympic Stadium. Kent County Cricket Club also regularly play at Beckenham. Rugby union Twickenham Stadium Rugby union is also well established in London, especially in the middle-class suburbs to the north and west of the city. Four of the twelve clubs in the Aviva Premiership have London origins, although only two of them now play in London. The two clubs that play in London are Harlequins, which play at The Stoop, and Saracens, which play at Allianz Park in Hendon. London Irish shares Madejski Stadium, a football ground outside the boundaries of Greater London in Reading (though still in the metropolitan area). Wasps left the London commuter belt entirely in December 2014, moving to Coventry and purchasing Ricoh Arena, a major football ground. In more recent years, a modern tradition has seen these four clubs play out of Twickenham during the first round of the Premiership, in a double-header. Apart from the traditional elite clubs, London Welsh, currently in the RFU Championship, have bounced between the Premiership and Championship in recent years, having either been promoted to or relegated from the Premiership in each season since 2011–12. From their first Premiership season in 2012–13 to their most recent in 2014–15, they shared a football ground outside the commuter belt, Kassam Stadium in Oxford, but they have now returned to Greater London at Old Deer Park in Richmond. Two London-based clubs compete in the Championship—Ealing Trailfinders, from the North London borough of Ealing, and London Scottish, also based in Richmond. Another club from the immediate London area has recently played in the Championship before being relegated to National League 1—Esher, located just outside Greater London in Hersham, last played in the Championship in 2011–12. In addition to the professional clubs, many amateur sides exist and include teams such as London Nigerian who draw their players from the supporters of fallen corrupt Nigerian regimes as well as numerous accountants, doctors and lawyers from Nigeria's Igbo and Yoruba communities. The Twickenham Stadium is regarded as England's national rugby stadium, and is named due to the town of Twickenham. The English national side play their home matches there during the Six Nations Championship, as well as the November inbound touring nations. The ground also hosted the 1991 Rugby World Cup final, where Australia defeated England. Twickenham hosts the final of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, and has hosted the European club championship final five times—four times in the era of the former Heineken Cup, and most recently in 2015 for the new European Rugby Champions Cup. The stadium is also host to The Varsity Match between Oxford and Cambridge as well as the English school's Daily Mail Cup final. London was also home to the massive celebrations for the English rugby team when they returned home from Australia after winning the 2003 Rugby World Cup, where Jonny Wilkinson kicked a drop-goal in extra time. An estimated 750,000 gathered in Trafalgar Square to celebrate their arrival. Rugby league London Broncos play at Trailfinders Sports Ground. Before a 2015 reorganisation of the professional leagues, they were the only member of the elite Super League in London, and indeed, all of southern England. They now play in the second-level Championship. Another London club in the professional ranks of the game is London Skolars (based in Haringey) who play in the third- level League 1. Amateur and grassroots rugby league has a strong presence in London. Greenwich Admirals (Woolwich), Elmbridge Rugby League Club (Esher) and London Chargers (Croydon) all play in the Rugby League Conference, the local top level of which is the Rugby League Conference South Premier. Many more clubs and second teams in London and the surrounding area play in the London League which serves as a feeder for the Rugby League Conference. The top level age group competition is the London Junior League. Rowing 2002 Oxbridge Boat Race The River Thames is the venue for the Boat Race, held between Oxford and Cambridge universities every year from Putney to Mortlake. In addition there are numerous rowing clubs in London based along the Thames, especially in the Putney area. More than twenty rowing clubs are based on the Thames at Putney Embankment; among the largest are London Rowing Club (the oldest, being established in 1856), Thames Rowing Club, University of London Boat Club, Imperial College Boat Club and Vesta Rowing Club. Leander Club owned a boathouse in Putney from 1867 to 1961. The Putney clubs have produced a plethora of Olympic medallists and Henley winners. Facilities for rowing are excellent throughout the city, including the state-of-the-art London Regatta Centre, at Royal Albert Dock in the Docklands. Tennis The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, home of the Wimbledon Championships, is in Wimbledon in south London. London is also home to Queen's Club, a sports club that hosts the annual Queen's Club Championships. The O2 Arena is the home of the ATP World Tour Finals through at least 2015. There is also the National Tennis Centre recently opened by the Queen in Roehampton. Basketball For years London Towers have been the flagship of London basketball, dominating the domestic British Basketball League (BBL), challenging in the Euroleague and fighting out a cross-town rivalry with Greater London Leopards. However, early into the new millennium both teams encountered several financial obstacles and soon folded. After Towers withdrew from the BBL in 2006, lower-league team London United were elected to the top-tier to ensure the capital continued its presence in Britain's only professional league. Yet after just a year they too found themselves falling at financial hurdles and were replaced by another lower-league outfit, London Capital, who now fly the flag for London in the BBL. In similar fashion, following the demise of the Leopards in 2003, fans set up a new club to replace and carry on the Leopards name. The reincarnated London Leopards today compete in the second-tier English Basketball League. The O2 arena hosted the Euroleague Final Four in 2013. The current only London professional basketball team is the London Lions. The London Lions originated from Milton Keynes but moved to London in 2013. Playing out of Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in year one, the team qualified for the end of season Playoffs with an all English squad. The following year the club moved into the Copper Box Olympic facility and duly sold out 7,000 seats for their first ever game against US College side, Iowa University. In the spirit of legacy, the club has forged partnerships whilst building a truly community club in London, in association with GLL (the largest leisure provider in the city), and now the Youngblood Lions, Hackney Community College, Epping Forest College, Raines School, Right Development Foundation and many more. This season (2017–18), the Club finished second in the premiership league and won the British Basketball All-Stars Championship.  Athletics  The Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in South London hosts an athletics track and is often use for national meetings. Other athletics venues include Croydon Arena, Mile End Stadium, Olympic Stadium in east London plus Perivale Park and Linford Christie Stadium in the west. Every April since 1981, London has hosted one of the world's largest mass-participation marathons, the London Marathon.Flora London Marathon – Background www.london-marathon.co.uk Indeed, the now standard length for a modern marathon was set in the 1908 London Olympics. The London Triathlon, the largest triathlon event in the world, also takes place annually.  American football  Between 1991 and 1998, the London Monarchs competed in American football's NFL Europe, winning the inaugural World Bowl. Today, the London Olympians, London Blitz and the London Cobras all compete in various divisions of the BAFA Community Leagues which is a continuation of the now defunct British American Football League. The new Wembley Stadium hosted a National Football League regular-season game in 2007, the first outside North America. Since the beginning of the NFL International Series in 2007, Wembley Stadium has seen massive turnouts for each annual game. The 2009 edition between the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was played in front of an announced crowd of 84,254. The 2010 match-up which featured the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos saw a turnout of almost 84,000 spectators.Niners strike Wembley gold www.skysports.com The series has continued to this day, with two games played in 2013; three in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018; and four in 2017, 2019, and 2020. In addition, the Jacksonville Jaguars are taking one home game to Wembley as part of the International Series from 2013 through to 2020. (In 2020, the Jaguars will play two home games at Wembley.) The 2016 season will be the first in which International Series games will be played at two London venues. One 2016 game is set for Twickenham, which will host at least three and as many as five games from 2016 to 2018. From 2019 to 2028, and possibly longer, at least two International Series games will also be held at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Other sports Recent years have seen cycling in London become increasingly popular. Transport for London have taken measures to improve cycling safety, and launched new initiatives including the Barclays Cycle Hire, Cycle Superhighways, and free cycle training. The Lee Valley VeloPark was constructed for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and re-opened to the public in March 2014. London was a part of the 2007 and 2014 Tour de France. London once had 2 top-level ice hockey teams, the London Knights (who played at London Arena) and London Racers (who played at the Lee Valley Ice Centre). There are no London-based teams in the Elite Ice Hockey League; London does however ice a few teams in the lower-tier English Premier Ice Hockey League (Romford Raiders) and English National Hockey League (Lee Valley Lions, Haringey Greyhounds and Streatham Redskins). The first games of the 2007–08 NHL season were played in London. Other popular sports include netball, field hockey, basketball, baseball (Croydon Pirates are champions), bowls, snooker, tennis, swimming, motor-racing at Brands Hatch, golf, darts, racquets, croquet, squash, horse-racing (Epsom and elsewhere), boxing, wrestling and archery. London also has Inter-county Gaelic football and Hurling teams which is one of only two outside Ireland to compete in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship or the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Similarly, London plays host to London Camanachd, one of the few shinty team outside Scotland which competes in Camanachd Association competitions and English Shinty Association competitions. London also hosts three women's roller derby leagues: the London Rockin' Rollers, London Roller Derby, and Croydon Roller Derby. All are widely regarded as top teams in Europe, with the London Rollergirls' A and B teams (London Brawling and Brawl Saints) both unbeaten in Europe.

Publication history Created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, the character made his first appearance in Crisis on Infinite Earths #1 (April 1985). He had a prominent role in that series, and appeared 20 years later as one of the two primary antagonists of the sequel Infinite Crisis, alongside Superboy-Prime. Fictional character biography=Crisis on Infinite Earths Alexander Luthor Jr. is born on Earth-Three, the son of that world's Lex Luthor (known as Alexander Luthor) and Lois Lane-Luthor. Luthor Sr. is Earth-Three's only hero, fighting the Crime Syndicate (an evil version of the Justice League of America). In the 1985 DC Comics 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, a being known as the Anti-Monitor destroys innumerable universes (including Earth-Three) with an anti-matter wave. To save their son, the Luthors place him in an experimental device which carries the infant to the relative safety of Earth-One.Crisis on Infinite Earths #1 (April 1985) Adventures of Superman #649 (April 2006) cover by Ivan Reisalt=Drawing of futuristic people, headed towards a light Alexander materializes on the abandoned satellite which was formerly headquarters of the Justice League.

By the end of Crisis Luthor is a young adult, despite the passage of only a few weeks.Crisis on Infinite Earths #3 (June 1985) After the Monitor's death, Alexander helps lead the heroes and villains of the DC Universe against the Anti-Monitor.Crisis on Infinite Earths #5 (August 1985)Crisis on Infinite Earths #9 (December 1985) After defeating the Anti- Monitor (with the help of Kal-L, the Earth-Two Superman and the Earth-Prime Superboy), Alexander reveals that he has saved Kal-L's wife, the Earth-Two Lois Lane, from being erased from existence when the multiverse was destroyed. The foursome, no longer having a place in the Post-Crisis universe, retreat to a \\"paradise dimension\\" (which Alexander accesses with the last of his dimensional powers).Crisis on Infinite Earths #12 (March 1986) Escape from \\"Heaven\\" Infinite Crisis Secret Files reveals how the four survivors spent the years since the Crisis. The survivors have power over the dimension, and it reacts to their thoughts and emotions. Alexander (who has rapidly aged to his mid-30s) becomes colder and more detached from the well-being of the universe's living beings. Superboy-Prime is frustrated, and Alexander uses this opportunity to convince him to help fix reality. Playing on his anger, Alexander only shows him negative aspects of the new reality to convince him that it is inferior;Infinite Crisis: Secret Files & Origins (April 2006) for example, Superboy-Prime appears to be unaware that Hal Jordan and Parallax are separate entities. Furiously trying to escape, Superboy-Prime unsuccessfully pounds on the barrier wall of the paradise dimension. This assault on the universe causes \\"ripples\\" which alter reality, explaining in-story the real- life changes and retcons in DC continuity over the past 20 years. Superboy- Prime's efforts frustrate him; he is not as powerful in the post-Crisis heaven, because he has no yellow sun to power him. Eventually Alexander reveals that his own powers are returning, and the two combine forces to break through the barrier wall. Together, they set into motion the events that culminate in Infinite Crisis: * Superboy-Prime pushes the planet Rann into Thanagar's orbit, destroying Thanagar's ecosystem, sparking the Rann-Thanagar War and shifting the center of the universe away from Oa.Rann-Thanagar War (2005) * Alexander poses as Lex Luthor and starts the new Society of Super- Villains.Villains United (2005) * Alexander recruits the Psycho-Pirate to place Eclipso's Black Diamond in Jean Loring's Arkham Asylum cell.Superman (vol. 2) #216 (May 2005) Loring, as Eclipso, then seduces the Spectre into destroying all magic, leading to the death of the wizard Shazam and the Rock of Eternity's destruction, releasing many demons and causing terrible impacts on magic.Day of Vengeance (2005) * Superboy-Prime destroys the Justice League Watchtower and abducts Martian Manhunter.JLA #118 (September 2005) * Alex hijacks control of Brother Eye from Batman, initially giving it sentience before placing it in Maxwell Lord's care. Thus giving him control over the OMACs and Checkmate's files on Earth's metahumans.The OMAC Project (2005) Infinite CrisisCountdown= Alexander watches the events on the post-Crisis Earth for several years with his companions, and eventually convinces a pessimistic Kal-L to break the walls of their paradise to intervene on post-Crisis Earth.Infinite Crisis #1 (December 2005) Alexander tells Kal-L and his cousin Power Girl that they can help him bring aspects of Earth-Two into predominance over the merged universes (since Earth-One had become predominant Post-Crisis), which will help Earth-Two's Lois Lane recover from her current illness.Infinite Crisis #2 (January 2006) =\\"I'm you. Only better.\\"= alt=Multiple comic panels of Alexander Luthor confronting his father Lex Luthor does everything in his power to find his impersonator. Assuming the identity Mockingbird, he organizes the Secret Six. Lex eavesdrops on Alexander's transmissions for months, and finally confronts him in the Arctic. When Lex asks who he is, Alexander replies \\"I'm you. Only better.\\" Alexander also reveals that his presence on Earth is what has been causing Lex' recent erratic behavior and interference to his thought processes. Lex is almost killed by Alexander and Superboy-Prime, but escapes by teleporting away. Not only is Alexander masquerading as Lex Luthor, he is also using the Society to construct a massive dimensional \\"tuning fork\\" (like those in the original Crisis). The structure incorporates heroes and villains from the Earths who combined to form the post-Crisis Earth, and the remains of the Anti-Monitor.Infinite Crisis #3 (February 2006) (This scheme was not new in DC Comics; in Justice League of America #197, Ultra-Humanite banished super- heroes from Earth-1 and Earth-2 to Limbo and the result—already calculated by the villain—was Earth-2's reality, transformed into a world without heroes.) alt=Large comic drawing of human-looking tower The device requires a vast power source to operate, which Alexander generates by manipulating the Spectre into destroying magic (as seen in Day of Vengeance). With sorcerers dead (and their resulting control over magic extinguished), the result is a raw form of magic that the device can tap into; this is personified by the power commanded by the wizard Shazam after his death. He needs lightning provided by one of Shazam's champions, Black Adam, who says the word due to influence from the Psycho-Pirate. Alexander programs the tower by granting sentience to the Brother Eye satellite, allowing the system to evolve into a brain capable of directing the tower's energies and mapping the new multiverse to help him find the perfect Earth he seeks.Infinite Crisis #4 (March 2006) With the device Alexander can divide the universe, re-creating the multiverse. He seems successful in recreating Earth-Two (or a close facsimile); however, he notes that this objective is not his ultimate one (which is to gather elements from every Earth to create one single, perfect Earth). With the parallel Earths restored Alexander combines various Earths, randomly bringing them together to observe the result (despite the billions of lives he destroys) and destroying the result if unsuitable. At the center of the universe, Donna Troy and her team see gigantic representations of Alexander's hands creating a rip in space.Infinite Crisis #5 (April 2006) As Alexander attempts to combine Earth- Two and Earth-Three (an act which would have killed Superman and Wonder Woman), Firestorm converts all the energy the heroes are firing at the rip into raw positive matter (which destroys Alexander's right index finger). Immediately after, Nightwing, Wonder Girl and Superboy arrive at the tower and free the captives. Superboy-Prime enters the fray; his fight with Conner destroys the tower, and the multiple Earths collapse into a single \\"New Earth\\".Infinite Crisis #6 (May 2006) His plan foiled, Alexander decides that if he cannot create a perfect Earth, he will take this Earth by force and shape it as best he can. To that end, the Society meets in Metropolis to decimate the remaining heroes (with Doomsday as their champion).Infinite Crisis #7 (June 2006) Death alt=Multiple panels of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s death After losing a battle (during which he seriously injures Nightwing with a blast which apparently drains his power), Alexander is held at gunpoint by Batman for severely injuring Nightwing and causing Superboy's death. Wonder Woman stops him, telling Batman that Alex is not worth it; Alex flees, proclaiming that this does not mean that Wonder Woman is \\"better\\". Lex Luthor and the Joker find him hiding in an alley in Gotham City. Alex broods over the failure of his plans (while reflecting that he is already coming up with another plan to achieve his goal), when he is distracted by a noise from further down the alley. The Joker mutilates Alex's face with his acid-flower (and lethal) joy-buzzer and Lex taunts his enemy for his mistakes, including underestimating Lex and excluding the Joker from the Society (the Joker was the only major villain not offered membership in the Society, due to his highly unpredictable nature). The Joker then shoots Alexander point-blank in the head with a shotgun, killing him, while Lex mockingly asks \\"Now who's stupid?\\". In 52 Week Three, the GCPD find a body in an alley resembling Lex Luthor. John Henry Irons examines the body at S.T.A.R. Labs and notices that contact lenses were inserted post-mortem to make the blue eyes appear green (like Lex's). Lex Luthor barges in with a throng of reporters, claiming that the body is that of an impostor from another Earth—the man truly responsible for his crimes. Although Alexander's body had a missing finger and a different genetic makeup from Lex's, 52 editor Stephen Wacker has confirmed that the body found in Gotham is indeed Alex, and Luthor altered it before police had discovered it. The Death of the New Gods mini-series (2008) reveals that Alexander was subtly manipulated by the Source into recreating the Multiverse. Blackest Night In the 2009–10 Blackest Night storyline, Alexander Luthor has been identified as one of the deceased who is entombed below the Hall of Justice,Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) and his corpse is revived as a Black Lantern during the \\"Blackest Night\\" event.Blackest Night #3 (September 2009) Gathering a group of black rings, he sends himself to Earth Prime. Once there he tracks down Superboy Prime (giving him a copy of his old battle suit), and prepares to kill him. Alexander also brings forth those whom Prime had killed during Infinite Crisis and Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds, using the rings to reanimate them as Black Lanterns to aid him in defeating the insane Boy of Steel.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #4 (November 2009) The Black Lanterns overwhelm Prime, who voluntarily puts on a black ring. The ring reacts to Prime's mixed emotions (cycling through the emotional spectrum), resulting in a burst of rainbow-colored energy which destroys Alexander and his fellow Black Lanterns.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #5 (December 2009) New 52 Alexander next appears in Justice League of America in 2011. In the Hall of Justice, the Justice League is attacked by the Antimatter Universe's Crime Syndicate of America. They join forces with Doctor Impossible's team to steal Alexander Luthor's corpse, intending to resurrect him in the Chamber of Resurrection. While the other Crime Syndicate members keep the JLA busy, Owlman sneaks off to allow Doctor Impossible access to the resurrection device. At the last moment, Doctor Impossible apparently betrays the Syndicate and substitutes Alexander's corpse for himself to resurrect Darkseid. The plot went awry when the machine instead gave birth to a new villain, known as Omega Man.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #50 (October 2010) Alexander is temporarily resurrected by the Tangent Green Lantern later in the story, allowing him to atone for his past misdeeds by helping to defeat the Omega Man and CSA.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #53 (January 2011) Powers and abilities Alexander's greatest talent is his genius-level intellect which he uses to manipulate other characters, outwit his enemies and engineer the Multiverse Tower. The circumstances of his escape from the doomed Earth-Three give him power over matter and anti-matter, which he can use offensively as bursts of energy or to form and control dimensional portals. He also has a form of precognitive abilities, enabling him to foresee the most probable events. Overuse of his power seems to drain him; following his attempt to restore the Multiverse (and a subsequent attack on Nightwing) he was left apparently as vulnerable as a normal human, clearly terrified when Batman appeared to be about to shoot him, and eventually being killed by the Joker.

Mendelsohn (July 13, 1926 – April 5, 1988) was an American pediatrician, anti-vaccinationist and critic of medical paternalism. He denounced unnecessary and radical surgical procedures and dangerous medications, reminding his readers of public health failures such as the 1976 swine flu outbreak and the damage caused to daughters of women who took the drug Diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy. He portrayed doctors as powerful priests of a primitive religion, with dishonesty as its central ethic. His mild manner appealed to the public, while his message infuriated his medical colleagues. Mendelsohn wrote a syndicated newspaper column called The People's Doctor, and also produced a newsletter with the same name (the newsletter continued after his death until 1992, under the name The Doctor's People.Eric Zorn, \\"Medical Pioneer\`s Torch Flickers Out\\", Chicago Tribune, April 5, 1992.) He published five books, including Confessions of a Medical Heretic,Howard Wolinsky, Leon Pitt, \\"Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn, 61, Evanston author, columnist\\", Chicago Sun- Times, April 6, 1988 . Mal(e) Practice: How Doctors Manipulate Women,Barbara Kleban Mills, \\"An Outspoken Physician Says the Biggest Threat to a Woman's Health Is Her Own Doctor\\", People, September 7, 1981. and How to Raise a Healthy Child…In Spite of Your Doctor. He appeared on over 500 television and radio talk shows. Education and career Mendelsohn was born in Chicago, Illinois. He received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1951. He was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics. Dr. Mendelsohn had a full-time private pediatric practice from 1956 to 1967, and continued to see patients of all ages on a consultancy basis until his death in 1988. For 12 years, Mendelsohn was an instructor at Northwestern University Medical College, and was associate professor of pediatrics and community health and preventive medicine at the [University of Illinois] College of Medicine for another 12 years. Mendelsohn served as National Director of Project Head Start's Medical Consultation Service, a position he was later forced to resign after criticizing the “deadening atmosphere” of regular public schools. He served as Chairman of the Medical Licensing Committee of Illinois. He was president of the alternative medicine National Health Federation (NHF) between 1981 and 1982. Criticism of medicine Mendelsohn said that the greatest danger to American women's health was often their own doctors, and contended that chauvinistic physicians subjected female patients to degrading, unnecessary and often dangerous medical procedures. Cancer treatments like hysterectomy and radical mastectomy, according to Mendelsohn, were among the most indiscriminately recommended surgical procedures. In an era in which the side effects of medications and the risks of medical treatments were hardly known except to doctors, Dr. Mendelsohn insisted that patients, too, had the right to such information. In the first of his books to attract widespread publicity, Confessions of a Medical Heretic (Contemporary Books 1979), he describes his efforts to make the Physician's Desk Reference, the authoritative guide to medications and medical treatments, available to the public. In Confessions, Mendelsohn argued that the methods of modern medicine were often more dangerous than the diseases they were designed to diagnose and treat. He advised consumers to be suspicious of their doctors. “One of the unwritten rules in Modern Medicine is always to write a prescription for a new drug quickly, before all its side effects have come to the surface.” (Confessions of a Medical Heretic, p. 32) Mendelsohn opposed vaccinations for children, claiming the shots are dangerous and worthless.\\"Successful Pediatrician Turned Gadfly : Medical Maverick Dr. Robert S.

His book Confessions of a Medical Heretic was negatively reviewed in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the reviewer noted that \\"the technique of describing one specific situation or case history and then generalizing to all situations or all case histories is a dangerous one, and such extrapolations are carefully avoided by all responsible scientists. However, this approach of Mendelsohn's supplies the grist for his mill— and its faulty.\\"Barclay, William R. (1979). Confessions of a Medical Heretic.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on January 2, 1954, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc. The title is a play on the phrase dog pound. Similar in concept to Ain't She Tweet, this cartoon features Sylvester in pursuit of catching Tweety, with a gang of bulldogs (including Hector) as the obstacles. Dog Pounded also marks the only use of Pepé Le Pew in a Friz Freleng-directed short (and the second time Pepé Le Pew has appeared in a cartoon that was not directed by Chuck Jones or a member from Chuck Jones' unit—the first being Arthur Davis' Odor of the Day). Plot A destitute Sylvester rummages through trash in search of food. Nearly out of luck, the cat hears singing coming from atop a tall tree inside an enclosure, looks up and sees Tweety. Sylvester, eager for his supper, rushes inside the enclosure ... unaware that the enclosure is the city dog pound. Sylvester gets attacked and driven from the pound by an army of bulldogs, whose purpose in life seemingly is to protect Tweety from predators. Wanting to get by the dogs, Sylvester employs the following tricks, all of them ending in failure: *Holding an umbrella for balance, the cat walks across a guide wire connecting a light pole and the tree. The dogs collectively blow a gust of doggie breath at their foe, causing Sylvester to lose his balance and fall into the waiting horde of dogs. *Digging a tunnel beneath the dog pound, to get at the tree unnoticed and snatch Tweety. The dogs, already having anticipated this latest scheme, have dug their own tunnel and wait for Sylvester to break through to their side. They attack Sylvester and chase him back to the tunnel entrance. Once he's all the way out of the tunnel, he closes it up with a shovel and forces the dogs back in. *A dog suit. The dogs startle their new \\"companion\\", causing the head to come loose, and Sylvester quickly tries to secure it before the dogs notice. However, either having already noticed or never being fooled from the start, the dogs reject Sylvester (as a fake dog) and force him to flee. The cat temporarily gets away, but the city dog catcher quickly returns him to his \\"home\\" (and a further beating). *Sylvester tries to climb over the fence, but the fence knocks him to the ground as a dog comes on the outside. The dog goes back in, flipping the fence frame back and revealing Sylvester having been clobbered. *Mass hypnotism, which momentarily evens the odds; by staring at the dogs, Sylvester is able to freeze and paralyze the dogs in place. Sylvester easily grabs Tweety, who panics and helplessly yells to his protectors to rescue him. When Sylvester blurts out the secret to un-freezing the dogs (a police whistle), Tweety instantly provides one and begins to blow ... except Sylvester quickly sees that coming and places a glass over Tweety. But Tweety fights back by poking Sylvester's palm with a needle ... and breaking the dogs out of their trance. *Entering an empty dog pound, Sylvester tries climbing the tree ... only to discover the dogs waiting on the branches. *Blasting himself off in a rocket. The rocket shoots without him and he is shown furless. *A swing, which Sylvester hopes will allow him to swing harmlessly above the dogs to the tree. However, the swing's reach is too low, and the dogs are able to get at Sylvester ... who never returns to the outside. The final attempt nearly works: Painting a phony skunk stripe down his back to scare the dogs away. This plan proves to work too well: just as he grabs Tweety and makes his getaway, he is intercepted by Pepé Le Pew who mistakes Sylvester for a female skunk and tries to make love to him. While Sylvester tries to break free from Pepé's grasp, Tweety looks on and comments, \\"That puddy tat has turned into an awful stinker!\\" Pepé's high-pitched kissing sounds are heard just before the \\"That's all, Folks!\\" title card appears.

Its location is along the original Boston Post Road, and an original mile marker of that road is still visible across Main Street on the Dean Park side. The building was enlarged by the General in 1785, raising the roof and nearly doubling its size, to accommodate the family of his son Thomas Walter Ward alongside his own household. It was enlarged again in 1820 by Thomas Walter Ward, adding a two-story ell to the rear. The main structure was occupied by Ward family members until 1909. From 1909 until 1954 descendants of the general lived in a second structure situated behind the colonial home. The property was donated by the family to Harvard University in 1925. The home is now operated by Harvard as a museum and is open to the public for limited hours during the summer months.

Some of Flavell's accomplishments include writing a book on children's cognitive development titled The Developmental Psychology of Jean Piaget in 1963. In 1970 Flavell was the president of the APA's division of Developmental Psychology. Flavell served for eight years on the SRCD's (Society for Research in Child Development) Governing Council and is a charter member of the editorial board of Cognitive Psychology. Flavell has written more than 120 books and in 1984 he received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association (APA).Encyclopedia of Psychology Retrieved December 7, 2011 Flavell, John H. Stanford University, 2011. Retrieved 26 July 2011. He was recognized with an Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions from the American Psychological Society in 1984, and was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1994. He is currently an emeritus professor of developmental psychology at Stanford. Flavell has conducted extensive research into metacognition and the child's theory of mind. One of his most famous contributions to the field is his work on children's developing understanding of the distinction between appearance and reality. These studies assessed young children's ability to acknowledge that a given object is really one kind of thing, yet appears to be another kind of thing, or that a given piece of material is really one color, yet appears to be another color under particular circumstances. Flavell and his colleagues have found that whereas most three- year-olds fail these tasks, five-year-olds and older four-year-olds succeed on them. Flavell interprets this developmental difference as suggesting that children acquire the notion of mental representation of reality as distinct from reality itself. The appearance-reality paradigm, along with the false- belief task, is widely used as diagnostic of theory of mind development during early childhood. Flavell's other work has addressed children's developing understanding of perception, perspective-taking, and their introspective insight into their own subjective experiences.

Early life Washington was born in Pope's Creek, Wakefield, Westmoreland County, Colony of Virginia, in November 1734. He was the second son born to Mary Ball Washington and Augustine Washington. From his parents marriage he was the brother of George Washington, Betty Washington Lewis, John Augustine Washington, Charles Washington, and Mildred Washington, who died young. From his father's first marriage, he was the half-brother of Lawrence Washington and Augustine Washington Jr., and Jane Washington, who died shortly after his birth. From 1735 to 1738, he resided at Mount Vernon. Career \\"Harewood,\\" Samuel Washington house, designed by John Ariss in 1770, photographed by Frances Benjamin Johnston, ca. 1930s Samuel served in numerous posts in Stafford County, Virginia, including justice from November 1766 until he was listed as removed on July 27, 1767, he was one of twenty seven justices of Stafford County. He was appointed justice of the peace by Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore on April 17, 1772, and a year later was appointed county sheriff, reappointed in 1776, but was forced to resign due to ill health on April 3, 1777. He also served as county magistrate, a Colonel in the Virginia Militia, and parish vestryman. He had Harewood, a Georgian-style mansion near then Charles Town, Virginia, designed by the renowned architect John Ariss in 1770. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Among the prominent visitors to the home were his brother George, Louis Phillipe, later King of France, and his two brothers, the Duke of Montpensier and the Count de Beaujolais, a son of the Marquis de Lafayette. His home was also the host of the wedding of James Madison and Dolly Payne Todd as Dolly's sister, Lucy, had previously been married to one of Samuel's sons. Personal life Samuel married five times and had nine children. His first marriage was to Jane Champe (1724–1755) around 1754. Two years after his first wife's death, he married secondly to Mildred Thornton (c. 1741–c. 1762) circa 1756. She possibly died during or shortly after childbirth. Her cousin, also named Mildred Thornton, married Samuel's younger brother Charles. Together, Mildred and Samuel were the parents of: * Thornton George Washington (1760–1787), who married twice. * Tristram Washington (c. 1762), who died young. After Mildred's death, he married for the third time to Lucy Chapman (1743–1763), who also died during childbirth with: * Infant Washington (1762–1762), who died young. His fourth marriage was to Anne Steptoe (1737–1777) in 1764. This marriage produced four children before her death while taking the smallpox inoculation during the Revolutionary War in 1777, including: * Ferdinand Steptoe Washington (1767–1788), who died of consumption in Lancaster County. * George Steptoe Washington (1773–1809), who married Lucy Payne, sister of Dolley Madison, wife of James Madison. * Lawrence Augustine Washington (1775–1824), who married Mary Dorcas Wood. * Harriot Washington (1776–1822), who married Andrew Parks of Fredericksburg. His fifth and final marriage was in 1778 to Susannah Perrin (1753–1783). Together, Susannah and Samuel were the parents of: * John Perrin Washington (1781–1784), who died young. Washington, who suffered from tuberculosis, as did many of his wives and sons, died at age 46 on September 26, 1781, in Berkeley County, Virginia, three weeks before the decisive Franco-American victory of Yorktown. His probable cause of death was from tuberculosis, or a similarly contagious and recurring respiratory disease. Descendants Through his son George, he was the grandfather of Samuel Walter Washington (1799–1831), who married Louisa Clemson, sister of Ambassador Thomas Green Clemson, who served as the United States Superintendent of Agriculture and founded Clemson University in South Carolina.

The story follows a New England artist struggling to reunite with his young son after a mysterious signal broadcast over the global cell phone network turns the majority of his fellow humans into mindless vicious animals. Plot Clayton Riddell, a struggling artist from Maine, has just landed a graphic novel deal in Boston when \\"The Pulse\\", a signal sent out over the global cell phone network, suddenly turns every cell phone user into a mindless zombie- like killer. Clay is standing in Boston Common when the Pulse hits, causing chaos to erupt around him. Civilization crumbles as the \\"phoners\\" attack each other and anyone in view. Amidst the chaos, Clay is thrown together with middle-aged Tom McCourt and teenager Alice Maxwell; the trio escapes to Tom's suburban home as Boston burns. The next day, they learn the \\"phoners\\" have begun foraging for food and banding together. Clay is still determined to return to Maine and reunite with his young son, Johnny. Having no better alternatives, Tom and Alice come with him. They trek north by night across a devastated New England, having fleeting encounters with other survivors and catching disturbing hints about the activities of the phoners, who still attack non-phoners on sight. Crossing into New Hampshire, they arrive at the Gaiten Academy, a prep school with one remaining teacher, Charles Ardai, and one surviving pupil, Jordan. The pair show the newcomers where the local phoner flock goes at night: they pack themselves into the Academy's soccer field and \\"switch off\\" until morning. It is clear the phoners have become a hive mind and are developing psychic abilities. The five survivors decide they must destroy the flock and, using two propane tankers, they succeed in doing so. Clay tries to get everyone to flee the scene, but the others refuse to abandon the elderly Ardai. That night, all of the survivors share the same horrific dream: each dreamer sees himself in a stadium, surrounded by phoners, as a disheveled man wearing a Harvard University hooded sweatshirt approaches, bringing their death. Waking, the heroes share their frightening dream experiences and dub him \\"the Raggedy Man\\". A new flock surrounds their residence, and the \\"normies\\" face the flock's metaphorical spokesman: the man in the Harvard hoodie. The flock kills other normals in reprisal and orders the protagonists to head north to a spot in Maine called \\"Kashwak\\". To stop their main objection, the flock psychically compels Ardai to commit suicide. Clay and the others bury him and travel north, as Clay is still determined to go home. En route, they learn that as \\"flock-killers\\" they have been psychically marked as untouchables, to be shunned by other normies. Following a petty squabble on the road, Alice is killed by a loutish pair of normies. The group buries her and arrives in Clay's hometown of Kent Pond, where they discover notes from Johnny which tell them Clay's estranged wife Sharon was turned into a phoner, but their son survived for several days, before he and the other normies were prompted by the phoners to head to the supposedly cell phone-free Kashwak. Clay has another nightmare which reveals that once there, the normie refugees were all exposed to the Pulse. He remains intent on finding his son, but after meeting another group of flock-killers, Tom and Jordan decide to avoid the ceremonial executions the phoners have planned. Before separating, the group discovers that Alice's murderers were psychically compelled into a gruesome suicide act for touching an untouchable. Clay sets off alone, but the others soon reappear driving a small school bus; the phoners have used their ever-increasing psychic powers to force them to rejoin him. One of the flock-killers, construction worker Ray Huizenga, surreptitiously gives Clay a cell phone and a phone number, telling him to use them when the time is right; Ray then commits suicide. The group arrives at Kashwak, the site of a half-assembled county fair, where increasing numbers of phoners are beginning to behave erratically and break out of the flock. Jordan theorizes that a computer program caused the Pulse and that, while it is still broadcasting into the battery-powered cell phone network, it has become corrupted with a computer worm that has infected the newer phoners with a mutated Pulse. Nevertheless, an entire army of phoners is waiting for them and Clay notices Sharon is among them. The phoners lock the group in the fair's exhibition hall for the night; tomorrow is the ceremonial execution to be psychically broadcast to all phoners and remaining normies in the world. As Clay awaits their morning execution, he sees Ray's unspoken plan: Ray had filled the rear of the bus with explosives, wired a phone-triggered detonator to them and killed himself to prevent the phoners from telepathically discovering the explosives. The group breaks a window for Jordan to squeeze through and he drives the vehicle into the midst of the inert phoners. Thanks to a jury-rigged cell phone patch set up by the pre-Pulse fair workers, Clay is able to detonate the bomb and wipe out the Raggedy Man and his flock. The majority of the group heads into Canada, to let the approaching winter wipe out the region's unprotected and leaderless phoners. Clay heads south, seeking his son. He finds Johnny, who received a \\"corrupted\\" Pulse; he wandered away from Kashwak and seems to almost recognize his father. However, Johnny is an erratic shadow of his former self and so, following another theory of Jordan's, Clay decides to give Johnny another blast from the Pulse, hoping the increasingly corrupted signal will cancel itself out and reset his son's brain. The book ends with Clay dialing and placing the cell phone to Johnny's ear. Characters *Clayton Riddell: a graphic artist separated from his family in Boston as the Pulse destroys civilization. Clay heads north with a group of survivors and tries to find his son, Johnny, and estranged wife, Sharon. *Tom McCourt: a middle-aged, man from Malden; Tom teams up with Clay in the initial chaos created by the Pulse. With Clay and Alice, he travels to his home in Malden. Then, they move on north where they meet others. He remains with the group until after Kashwak, when he survives and leaves Clay along with Jordan, Denise and Dan. *Alice Maxwell: a 15-year-old girl; Alice teams up with Clay and Tom to head north. She forces her anxiety and trauma into an abandoned child's Nike shoe which helps her cope with the atrocities committed by the phoners. Alice remains an important part of the group who continue to take inspiration from her even after she gets murdered. *Jordan: a 12-year-old-boy studying at Gaiten Academy, a prep school that was devastated by the Pulse; Jordan faithfully remains with the headmaster, Charles Ardai, until they destroy the flock at the school and Ardai is driven to suicide by the phoners. Jordan remains with Clay's group and provides the intellectual theory and comparison of the effects of the Pulse to that of a worm in a computer. *Charles Ardai: the headmaster of Jordan's prep school; Ardai is a father figure to Jordan and cares for the group. They manage to destroy a flock of phoners, but then Ardai is telepathically forced to commit suicide. *Dan Hartwick: a survivor and head of another flock-killing group; a former professor, Dan is intelligent and joins Clay's group as they head to Kashwak. He ultimately survives and leaves Clay with Jordan, Denise and Tom. *Denise Link: a pregnant survivor and part of Dan's flock-killing group; Denise joins the group with Dan and Ray and ultimately survives with them. She is described by Clay as a strong-willed woman and leaves with Tom, Jordan and Dan after Kashwak. *Ray Huizenga: a construction worker who specialized in explosives; Ray was part of Dan's group of flock-killers along with Denise, but has a plan regarding Kashwak. He gives Clay vague instructions about the plan before committing suicide with a pistol in order to mask his plans from the phoners. This ultimately saves the entire group. *The Raggedy Man/President of Harvard: the main antagonist of the book; he wears a torn red Harvard hoodie. He is killed by the bomb at Kashwak. *\\"Pixie Light\\": a teenage girl spotted by Clay in Boston and dubbed Pixie Light because of her haircut and hair color, this girl was one of the first victims of the Pulse and attacked another phoner seconds after listening to the Pulse on her cell phone. Pixie Light tore out the phoner's neck with her teeth and was knocked unconscious by Clay before she could do any more harm and was left on the streets of Boston. *\\"Pixie Dark\\": a teenage girl spotted by Clay in Boston who was named for reasons similar to Pixie Light; Pixie Dark was Pixie Light's friend and only heard a small dose of the Pulse via Pixie Light's cell phone. Instead of going completely crazy like her friend, Pixie Dark's brain was erased by the Pulse and she lost her mind, running off into Boston shouting \\"Who am I?\\" over and over. She is referenced several times throughout the book by Clay. *Gunner and Harold: a pair of young men encountered by Clay's group not long after they depart Gaiten; mouthy and rude (particularly toward Alice), they believe that Kashwak will be a safe haven for \\"normies\\". Following their brutal reciprocation to a threat made to them by Clay, Gunner and Harold are summarily punished for daring to touch an untouchable. *Other minor characters are briefly mentioned or seen throughout the book, primarily either as \\"normies\\" (\\"Plump Bible-toting Lady\\", Roscoe Handt) or phoners (\\"Power Suit Woman\\", Judy Scottoni). eBay auction A role in the story was offered to the winner of a charity auction sponsored by eBay: Other authors like Peter Straub also participated in the online auction, selling roles in their upcoming books. The King auction ran between September 8 and 18, 2005 and the winner, a Ft. Lauderdale woman named Pam Alexander, paid over $25,000. Ms. Alexander gave the honor as a gift to her brother Ray Huizenga; his name was given to one of the zombie-slaughtering \\"flock-killers\\" in the story, a construction worker who specializes in explosives, but then later commits suicide in order to aid the \\"flock-killers\\" escape. Reception The book generally received positive reviews from critics. Publishers Weekly described it as \\"a glib, technophobic but compelling look at the end of civilization\\" and full of \\"jaunty and witty\\" sociological observations. Stephen King scholar Bev Vincent said \\"It's a dark, gritty, pessimistic novel in many ways and stands in stark contrast to the fundamental optimism of The Stand\\". Film adaptation On March 8, 2006, website Ain't It Cool News announced that Dimension Films had bought the film rights to the book and would produce a film to be directed by Eli Roth (Hostel, Cabin Fever) for a 2009 release. Said Roth about his approach to the film: On June 15, 2007, Eli Roth posted in his MySpace blog that he would not be directing Cell \\"anytime soon\\", as he planned to spend the rest of the year writing other projects. On July 10, 2009, he dropped out of the project, saying: On November 11, 2009, Stephen King announced at a book signing in Dundalk, Maryland that he had finished a screenplay. He stated that he had complaints with the ending of the book and it was redone for the screenplay. On October 31, 2012, it was announced that actor John Cusack would play the lead role of Clayton Riddell. On November 5, 2013, it was reported that Samuel L. Jackson had signed on to play Tom McCourt. Both actors previously starred in 1408, a 2007 film adaption of Stephen King’s short story of the same name. The film was released on June 10, 2016 to video on demand, prior to a limited release scheduled for July 8, 2016.

Alternate view Discovery and naming Janenschia has had a convoluted nomenclatural history. In 1907, Eberhard Fraas at \\"site P\\", nine hundred metres to the southeast of Tendaguru Hill, discovered two skeletons of gigantic sauropods. They were designated as \\"Skeleton A\\" and \\"Skeleton B\\". The fossils were transported to the collection of the Stuttgarter Naturaliensammlung in Stuttgart, Germany. Fraas in 1908 decided to name both skeletons as different species of one genus, Gigantosaurus. Skeleton A became Gigantosaurus africanus and skeleton B became Gigantosaurus robustus. The latter species was based on the holotype partial skeleton SMNS 12144, consisting of a right hindlimb. The specific name was inspired by the heavy build of the animal.Fraas, E. (1908) \\"Dinosaurierfunde in Ostafrika\\", Jahreshefte des Vereins für Vaterländische Naturkunde in Württemberg 64: 84–86 While doing so, Fraas knew full well that the name Gigantosaurus was already preoccupied by another taxon: Gigantosaurus megalonyx, named by Harry Govier Seeley in 1869. Fraas thought his actions could be justified by the fact that the description by Seeley had been limited and that the material of G. megalonyx had since been referred to another genus, Ornithopsis, by Richard Lydekker.E. Fraas. 1908. \\"Ostafrikanische Dinosaurier\\". Mitteilungen aus dem Königlichen Naturalien-Kabinett zu Stuttgart 55(61): 105-144E. Fraas. 1908. \\"Dinosaurier in Deutsch-Ostafrika\\".

Containing the Orders Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Squamata, Rhynchocephalia, and Proterosauria. British Museum (Natural History), London, 309 pp In 1911, Richard Sternfeld renamed Gigantosaurus Fraas 1908 into Tornieria, pointing out that Fraas's arguments had been irrelevant. Torniera africana became the type species of the new genus.R. Sternfeld. 1911. \\"Zur Nomenklatur der Gattung Gigantosaurus Fraas [On the nomenclature of the genus Gigantosaurus Fraas]\\". Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft Naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin 8: 398 G. robustus was placed in Tornieria, as T. robusta. Sternfeld's move was not well received in Germany, as he had acted without consent of the ailing Fraas. In 1922, Werner Janensch, who at the Tendaguru had collected additional material, in an article describing the hand of the animal announced that he would keep using the name Gigantosaurus robustus. He claimed that G. megalonyx was a forgotten nomen oblitum and that the rules of the zoological nomenclature should be disregarded if they caused instability by replacing a well-known name by a completely new one. At the same time he synonymized Tornieria with Barosaurus as regarded its type species which then became a Barosaurus africanus.Janensch, W., 1922, \\"Das Handskelett von Gigantosaurus robustus und Brachiosaurus brancai aus den Tendaguru-Schichten Deutsch-Ostafrikas\\", Centralblatt für Mineralogie, Geologie und Paläontologie 1922: 464–480 Janensch, for the remainder of his career, would consistently apply the name Gigantosaurus robustus. In 1928, Sidney Henry Haughton exceptionally assigned Tornieria robusta to Barosaurus also, as a Barosaurus robustus. In 1930, Baron Franz Nopcsa rejected Janensch' arguments. He admitted that Sternfeld had been discourteous but pointed out that the ICZN only in 1927 recommended that the original author should be involved in such name changes. It would thus be absurd to object to an article written in 1911 — and in any case the lack of courtesy had no bearing on the validity of the name. Nopcsa had found several later mentions of G. megalonyx, which thus had not been a nomen oblitum. Furthermore, Gigantosaurus robustus had prior to 1922 not exactly been a well- known name itself. Distasteful as it might be, Nopcsa concluded, it was inevitable to consider Tornieria to be a valid name.Nopcsa, F. 1930. \\"Zur Systematik und Biologie der Sauropoden\\". Palaeobiologica, 3: 40-52 SMNS 12144 was subsequently referred to Tornieria by other authors.Stromer, E. (1932). \\"Ergebnisse der Forschungsreisen Prof. E. Stromers in den Wüsten Ägyptens. II.

Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences à Paris, Série II 309:437–443 In 1991, German palaeontologist Rupert Wild of the Stuttgart Museum of Natural Sciences clarified the taxonomic status of G. robustus, by concluding that it was generically distinct from Tornieria. He renamed it Janenschia in honor of Werner Janensch, who had studied the vertebrate fauna from Tendaguru. Janenschia was placed in the family Titanosauridae, making it the oldest member of Titanosauria.Wild, R. (1991). Janenschia n. g. robusta (E. Fraas 1908) pro Tornieria robusta (E.

Two anterior dorsal vertebrae, and a possibly posterior cervical vertebra, previously referred to the genus, were named Tendaguria in 2000. On the other hand, the caudal vertebral series MB.R.2091.1–30 does not overlap with SMNS 12144 and instead represents the first taxon of Mamenchisauridae from outside Asia, Wamweracaudia.Philip D Mannion, Paul Upchurch, Daniela Schwarz, Oliver Wings; Taxonomic affinities of the putative titanosaurs from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania: phylogenetic and biogeographic implications for eusauropod dinosaur evolution, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, , zly068, https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zly068 Recent cladistic analysis places Janenschia as a non-titanosauriform sauropod.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The cartoon was released on April 19, 1952 and stars Bugs Bunny. The short is a return to the themes of the 1946 cartoon Hair-Raising Hare, and brings the monster Gossamer back to the screen. The title is a pun on the line \\"Water, water, everywhere / Nor any drop to drink\\" from the poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The cartoon is available on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1. A few scenes were featured in Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, With new animation with the Paranormalists at Large Commercials showing Bugs getting chased by Gossamer in the background as Daffy advertises. Plot Much like in Hair-Raising Hare, Bugs (after being flooded out of his rabbit hole while sleeping during a heavy rain) finds himself trapped in the castle of an \\"evil scientist\\" (the neon sign outside his castle says so, punctuated with a second flashing line, \\"BOO\\"), a caricature of Boris Karloff, and needs a living brain to complete an experiment, shown to be a giant robot. When Bugs awakens, he is terrified when he sees the scientist (\\"Eh, eh, eh, w-w-what's up, doc?\\"), a sarcophagus (\\"What's going on around here?\\") and the robot (\\"Where am I anyway?\\"), eventually running away after the terror of seeing all three. The scientist sends out an orange, hairy monster he calls \\"Rudolph\\" to retrieve him, with the promise of being rewarded with a spider goulash. In a scene very similar to the one in Hair-Raising Hare, Bugs keeps running until a trap door on the floor opens and a rock falls into a water pit, where there are crocodiles swimming around and snapping their jaws in the air. While he is walking backwards and praying, thankful he did not fall, he bumps into the monster. Bugs comes up with an idea (\\"Uh oh. Think fast, rabbit!\\") and makes as a gabby hairdresser, giving the hairy monster a new hairdo (\\"My stars! Where did you ever get that awful hairdo? It doesn't become you at all.

My stars, if an interesting monster can't have an interesting hairdo, then I don't know what things are coming to. In my business, you meet so many interesting people. Bobby pins, please. But the most interesting ones are the monsters. Oh, dear, that'll never stay. We'll just have to have a permanent.\\") He gets some dynamite sticks and places them in the monster's hair, which give the appearance of curlers. He lights them and runs off (\\"Now, I've got to give an interesting old lady a manicure; but I'll be back before you're done.\\") just before the explosion, which leaves the monster with a bald head. The monster, after tying his hair back up in a cone, goes after Bugs. In the chemical room, Bugs sees a bottle of \\"vanishing fluid\\" and pours it all over himself, becoming invisible (\\"Hmm,... Not bad.\\"). As the monster looks around for Bugs in the chemical room, Bugs gets a trash can and dumps it on the monster. Then he gets a mallet and hits the trash can, causing it to shake, then pulls out the rug the monster is standing on from underneath his feet, causing him to fall on his bottom when he takes the trash can off and looks around. For the coup de grâce, Bugs takes a bottle of \\"reducing oil\\" and pours the entire contents over the monster, shrinking him as he gets up, lets out a roar, and shrinks, but blinks, and walks away to get dressed. Putting on a suit, coat and hat and grabbing two suitcases, the monster enters a mouse hole, kicks its resident out, and slams the door, which bears a sign saying \\"I QUIT!\\", much to the agreement of the mouse, who, while holding up a bottle of whiskey (\\"xxx\\"), says, \\"I quit too.\\", then dashes away, and leaves his bottle behind. Bugs, still invisible, eats a carrot in satisfaction of getting rid of the monster (\\"Well, that's that.\\"). Suddenly, the mad scientist makes him visible with \\"hare restorer\\" (\\"Never send a monster to do the work of an evil scientist.\\"), insisting the rabbit hand over his brain (\\"Now be a cooperative little bunny and let me have your brain.\\"). When Bugs refuses (\\"Uh, sorry doc, but I need what little I've got.\\"), the scientist throws an axe straight at him. Bugs ducks and the axe breaks open a large bottle of ether, resulting in the fumes drugging both Bugs and the scientist. In slow motion, the groggy scientist chases after an equally groggy Bugs while issuing demands (\\"Come...back...here...you...rab...bit!\\") (Carl Stalling cleverly punctuates the chase by playing a slow, \\"drowsy\\" version of the William Tell Overture). Bugs slowly trips the scientist, who falls asleep to say (\\"Nighty, night.)\\". Still slowly, Bugs runs out of the castle and over the horizon, trips over a rock and falls asleep, just to say \\"(Nighty, night.)\\", landing in a stream which leads Bugs straight back into his flooded hole. He suddenly wakes up, declaring that it must have been a nightmare. The miniature monster passes by on a rowboat and tells him in a high-pitched voice: \\"Oh yeah!? That's what you think.\\", leaving Bugs with a confused look on his face. Cast *Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Gossamer (\\"Rudolph\\") and Mouse *John T.

She was well educated starting school at seven and moving on to a missionary school at nine. She was an early trained midwife and by the age of fourteen she was supervising births. She entered an abusive arranged marriage in Gaspar Mumputo in September 1959.

It was released on October 24, 2006, and was nominated for the World Fantasy Award in 2007. An early excerpt from the novel, \\"Lisey and the Madman\\", was published in McSweeney’s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories (2004), and was nominated for the 2004 Bram Stoker Award for Best Long Fiction.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi- bin/title.cgi?827096 King stated that this is his favorite of the novels he has written.https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqzn2/i_am_stephen_king_novelist_executive_producer_on/camwn7z The genesis for Lisey's Story was an incident in June 1999 in which King was hit by a van in Lovell, Maine, and seriously injured; while he was in the hospital, his wife Tabitha decided to redesign his studio. Coming home from the hospital and seeing his books and belongings in boxes, King saw an image of what his studio would look like after his death. Plot Lisey's Story is the story of Lisey Landon, the widow of a famous and wildly successful novelist, Scott Landon. The book tells two stories—Lisey's story in the present, and the story of her dead husband's life, as remembered by Lisey during the course of the novel. It has been two years since the death of famous author Scott Landon, and the widow Lisey (pronounced \\"lee-see\\") is still in the process of cleaning out her husband's writing area. Over the past two years many academics have come to her hoping to find some piece of writing she might have missed, like an unpublished manuscript. Lisey has sent each away in their turn explaining that she's still working through the clean up, although her lack of progress speaks more of procrastination. Her mentally fragile sister Amanda spends a day with her, searching through stacks of books and magazines to earmark any pictures where Lisey appears or is mentioned. Lisey begins to relive her past, starting with the time she saved Scott from being fatally shot by an insane fan. She often stops herself mid-reminisce to avoid uncovering terrifying memories. After Amanda discovers that her ex- husband has remarried and is moving back to town she slices open her hands and slips into catatonia. Before admitting Amanda to an institution Lisey hears her sister speaking in Scott's voice, telling her he has created a \\"bool\\" hunt with a prize at the end. One day she receives a disturbing phone call from a man calling himself Zack McCool, claiming that if Lisey doesn't hand over Scott's documents to a professor she had recently chased away he, Zack, would be forced to hurt her. His next step is to leave her a threatening letter and a dead cat in her mailbox. At this point Lisey alerts the authorities, although the most they can offer her is a patrol car stationed by her home unless an emergency arises elsewhere. This does not deter Zack in the least and he eventually sneaks onto her property and mutilates her with a can opener. Throughout the book Lisey begins to face certain realities about her husband that she had repressed and forgotten. She recalls Scott's past—how he came from a family with a history of horrible mental illness that manifested as either an uncontrollable homicidal mania or as a deep catatonia, how he had a special gift, an ability to transport himself to another world, which he called \\"Boo'ya Moon\\" with its own unique dangers, how Scott Landon's brother Paul was killed by their father when, at thirteen, Paul succumbed to the family disease and attempted to kill Scott, and how Scott really died. Using her own repressed ability to cross over to Boo'ya Moon, Lisey is able to pull Amanda out of her catatonia, bring Zack to the other world, and lure him to his grisly death in the jaws of a serpentine world-crossing beast that stalks the forest of Boo-ya Moon, which Scott referred to as the \\"long boy\\". The prize at the end of the hunt is a diary of Scott's last days with his family, ending with Scott Landon's confession that he was forced to kill his own father to save him from the madness that had finally taken him over. Over the next week Lisey is able to pack and give up Scott's things, as she now believes he has moved on. Now Lisey has a hard time keeping herself grounded in this world, often finding that she slips back to Boo'ya Moon in her sleep and sometimes while awake. The book ends with her saying goodbye to Scott in the now-empty study. Adaptation In August 2017, King expressed an interest in seeing the story adapted as a television series, \\"Lisey's Story is my favorite of the books and I would love to see that done, especially now that there's a kind of openness on the streaming services on TV and even the cable networks. There's more freedom to do stuff now and when you do a movie from a book, there's this thing that I call the sitting on a suitcase syndrome. That is where you try to pack in all the clothes at once and the suitcase won't close. So it's tough to take a book that is fully textured, and do it in two hours and 10 minutes. But as a TV show you have 10 hours.\\" In April 2019 it was announced that the book will be adapted as an eight part limited series called Lisey's Story, with all episodes scripted by Stephen King, starring Julianne Moore.

The revolt gained momentum when it spread to the largely tribal Shia regions of the middle and lower Euphrates. Sheikh Mehdi Al-Khalissi was a prominent Shia leader of the revolt. Sunni and Shia religious communities cooperated during the revolution as well as tribal communities, the urban masses, and many Iraqi officers in Syria.Atiyyah, Ghassan R. Iraq: 1908–1921, A Socio-Political Study. The Arab Institute for Research and Publishing, 1973, 307 The objectives of the revolution were independence from British rule and the creation of an Arab government. The revolt achieved some initial success, but by the end of October 1920 the British had crushed the revolt, although elements of it dragged on until 1922. During the 1920 revolt, another anti-British rebellion took place in the north of Iraq by the Kurds, who were trying to gain independence. One of the major Kurdish leaders of the Kurdish revolt was Sheikh Mahmoud Barzanji. Background After the Peace Treaty of Versailles in 1919 after World War I, the idea put forward by the League of Nations to create mandates for the territories that had been occupied by the defeated Central Powers began to take shape. The principle was that the territories should eventually become independent, albeit under the tutelage of one of the victorious Entente countries.Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq. Cambridge University Press, 2007, 40 People in Ottoman provinces began to fear the Mandate concept since \\"it seemed to suggest European imperial rule by another name\\". At the San Remo Conference in April 1920, Britain was awarded the Mandate for Mesopotamia, as Iraq was called in the Western world at the time, as well as a mandate for Palestine. In Iraq, the British got rid of most of the former Ottoman officials, and the new administration had mainly British officials. Many Iraqis began to fear that Iraq would be incorporated into the British Empire. One of the most eminent Shia mujtahid, Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi al-Shirazi, then issued a fatwa \\"declaring that service in the British administration was unlawful\\".Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq. Cambridge University Press, 2007, 41 There was growing resentment to new British policies such as new land ownership laws, which upset tribal leaders, especially for the new tax that people had to pay to be buried in the Wadi-us- Salaam Cemetery in Najaf, where Shia from all over the world came to be buried.Vinogradov, Amal. \\"The 1920 Revolt in Iraq Reconsidered: The Role of Tribes in National Politics,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.3, No.2 (April 1972): 133 Meetings between Shia ulema and tribal leaders discussed strategies for peaceful protests but they considered violent action if they failed to get results. The Revolution Discontent with British rule materialized in May 1920 with the onset of mass meetings and demonstrations in Baghdad. The start of the revolution was centered on peaceful protests against British rule. There were large gatherings at both Sunni and Shia mosques which showed that co-operation between the two main sects of Iraqi society was possible.Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq. Cambridge University Press, 2007, 43 At one of the larger meetings 15 representatives were nominated to present the case for Iraqi independence to the British officials. Acting Civil Commissioner, Arnold Wilson, dismissed their demands as impractical.Vinogradov, Amal. \\"The 1920 Revolt in Iraq Reconsidered: The Role of Tribes in National Politics,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.3, No.2 (Apr., 1972): 135 Armed revolt broke out in late June 1920. Ayatollah al-Shirazi issued another fatwa which read, \\"It is the duty of the Iraqis to demand their rights. In demanding them they should maintain peace and order. But if the English prevent them from obtaining their rights it is permitted to make use of defensive force.\\" al-Rahimi, ‘Abd al-Halim, Al-haraka al-Islamiyya fi al-‘Iraq: al-juthur alfikriyya wa al-waqi‘ al-tarikhi (1900–24) (The Islamic Movement in Iraq: Ideological Roots and Historical Situation, 1900–1924), Dar al-‘alamiyya, Beirut, 1985, 219 This seemed to encourage armed revolt. The British authorities tried to counter this by arresting a sheikh of the Zawalim tribe.Vinogradov, Amal. \\"The 1920 Revolt in Iraq Reconsidered: The Role of Tribes in National Politics,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.3, No.2 (Apr., 1972): 136 Later, an armed band of loyal tribal warriors stormed the prison and set him free. The revolt soon gained momentum as the British garrisons in the mid-Euphrates region were weak and the armed tribes much stronger. By late July, the armed tribal rebels controlled most of the mid-Euphrates region. The success of the tribes caused the revolt to spread to the lower Euphrates and all around Baghdad. The British War Secretary, Winston Churchill, authorized immediate reinforcements from Iran that included two squadrons of the Royal Air Force. The use of aircraft shifted the advantage to the British and played a huge role in ending the revolt.Vinogradov, Amal. \\"The 1920 Revolt in Iraq Reconsidered: The Role of Tribes in National Politics,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.3, No.2 (Apr., 1972): 137 There were also tribes that worked against the revolt since they were recognised by the British authorities and profited from the acknowledgement. Eventually, the rebels began to run low on supplies and funding and could not support the revolt for much longer, and the British forces had become more effective. The revolt ended in October 1920, when the rebels surrendered Najaf and Karbala to the British authorities.  The Beginning of the Revolution  Al Rumaitha incident = Declaration of revolution in al-Mashakheb = The Kufa Conference  Spread of the revolution to the Middle Euphrates The Samawah FrontBattle of Al-Khodar= Al-Khodar is a small village on the left bank of Euphrates River. On 30 July, Hadi al-Maqoutar arrived from the city of Najaf to incite the inhabitants of the village to join the revolt.علي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:298. He had what he wanted as the tribes living in that area began to sabotage the railway and telegraph lines passing through the area.علي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:299. The commander of the British forces in Iraq, General Haldane, ordered the forces stationed at the Khadr train station to withdraw immediately to the city of Nasiriyah, where the tribes that joined the revolution then attacked the station. This was on 13 August, when they were shooting fire towards the station. The station had a normal train and two armored trains but soon an incident happened to the first armored vehicle, which led to a problem. The British troops went by regular train only, and the train arrived at Ur's station safely in the same evening.علي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:300. =Battle of Al-Bawakher= The guards of the city of Samawah were divided into two sections, one of which was led by Colonel \\"Hai\\" and camped on the river in a place called Hsija coast near the city and the second was led by Captain \\"Rasel\\" and encamped around the city train station that was near the city wall. Both the sections became encircled after the British withdrew from the village of Al-Khoder and the rebels tightened the siege on them day after day.علي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:304. On 26 August, three warships and two regular ships moved from Nasiriyah to rescue the forces in Samawah. After fierce battles between the rebels and the ships, two warships and a regular ship reached the Samawah guards after the withdrawal of one of the warships on 27 August and returned to Nasiriyah. The rebels managed to seize one of the regular shipsعلي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:305. The station fell into the hands of the rebels after fierce battles between them and the British forces when the British forces tried to get out of the station camp by train, a large number of bodies fell from both sides during the confrontations.علي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:307. After this battle, the rebels besieged the main guards camp, which was led by Colonel Hai and asked him to surrender, but Colonel Hai rejected the request. the siege lasted for about two months until it they were rescued on 14 November.علي الوردي ج:5(أ). ص:308. =The Fall of Samawah to the British= The commander of the British forces in Iraq sent a telegram to General Kongham, who was busy cracking down the rebellion in the Diyala region, asking him to return to Baghdad on 16 September.Haldane - p223. On 1 October, General Kongham moved his forces from the city of Ur heading north. On the sixth of that month, he arrived at Al-Khoder where he was able to occupy it after he countered a resistance from the rebels. The British forces, while moving towards the city of Samawah, burned the villages on both sides of Euphrates River near the town of Al-Khoder.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:156. On the 12th of the same month, the British forces arrived near Samawah. The next day they moved towards the city and faced strong resistance from the rebels stationed around the city. After a fierce battle, the rebels withdrew from their fortified positions. On the 14th day the British troops entered the city and faced no Resistance, they broke the siege of the British forces, which was confined to the coast of Hassija near the city.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:157. As on 12 November, a battle took place between the British forces and the rebels of Bani Hajim clans at Sawir Bridge, which is also known as the Imam Abdullah Bridge, located 6 km north of the city of Samawah, in which 50 people were killed and more wounded. The number of British deaths is between 40 and 50.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:162. Due to this battle, General Kongham summoned a person named Mr. Mohamed to negotiate with Bani Hejim tribes. After negotiations between the two sides, an agreement on the conditions of extradition was finally signed in the city of Samawah between the parties on 20 November with the Bani Hajim and Fakhoudha tribes. Al-Rumaitha town was handed over after the signing of this agreement between the two parties. It should also be noted that the British did not arrest any of the elders of Bani Hajim.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:161.  Revolution in Karbala  A radical Shia cleric by the name of al-Sadr led the revolt. Artillery rounds fell around the golden dome of the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf, while al-Sadr's black-masked militia battled occupation forces in the streets of Iraq's holy cities. The year is 1920, and the radical Shia cleric resisting British occupying forces is Mohammad al-Sadr - whose great-grandson Moqtada al-Sadr is now leading a second revolt. The 1920 revolt was eventually put down after four months when British forces bombarded the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, but only after 500 British troops and 6,000 Iraqis had lost their lives. When the British expeditionary force captured Baghdad in March 1917, \\"liberated\\" Iraqis were baffled by the apparent lack of planning for what was to come next. The revolt began with rumors that Iraq, liberated from Ottoman rule, was not about to be handed over to the locals. Sir Arnold Wilson, Iraq's civilian administrator from 1918, pushed ahead with his plan to incorporate the country into the British Empire, against the wishes of his oriental secretary, Gertrude Bell. A brilliant, indefatigable man of the empire, Wilson was to be deeply humbled by the Shia rebellion. Four months of fighting blamed on his insistence on direct rule left him convinced that autonomy should be granted to the Iraqis as quickly as possible. Mohammad al-Sadr formed an \\"Independence Guard\\" from discontented Shi'ites, rapidly attracting Sunni dissidents from Baghdad and central Iraq. When the 1920 San Remo conference duly handed the mandate for Iraq to Britain, the reaction was immediate. In Karbala, a fatwa was issued declaring service in the British administration unlawful. Units of the Independence Guard set up offices in the major southern cities while Shi'ite and Sunni leaders in Baghdad arranged massive demonstrations. Britain at first ignored their protests and continued the policy of giving limited self-rule to the Iraqis. In June, British authorities announced that elections would be held for a Constituent Assembly. But the armed revolt was breaking out in central Iraq, triggered by the arrest of one of Sadr's deputies - another foreshadowing of events last week. The arrest of two of Moqtada's clerics last weekend prompted the current uprising. Fatwas declaring an all-out war were issued and the British garrisons in Najaf and Karbala were quickly overwhelmed. Rebellions sprang up in Basra, and Kurdistan in the north, but by September the revolt was beginning to flag. British forces, finally realizing the danger, arrested tribal leaders and flooded the country with troops. In Baghdad, Sunni leaders began to express reservations at the wisdom of following a revolt led by Shi'ite clergy. Many southern Shi'ite Arab tribes in Iraq had yet to take up arms. When the British forces shelled Najaf and Karbala into submission in October, the fighting ended. The Iraqi revolt of 1920, which began as a general protest against British rule, ultimately failed to unite the Shi'ite and Sunni communities against the occupation. Its leaders were exiled or kept under house arrest. Sadr himself kept a low profile, later to resurface as a prime minister in the country. But the effects of the revolt were profound. Ultimately, it curtailed the British occupation in Iraq. The mandate was scheduled to last 25 years but instead, the British pulled out after 12, retaining influence but diminishing control over the country. Iraq's Shi'ite community, defeated but unbowed, was left out of government for the next 80 years. Its exclusion from power has provided a powerful source of resentment currently driving Moqtada's second revolt. With American forces recapturing Sadr-controlled Kut, it appears that US military power, as with British before them, will eventually force the cleric to capitulate. But it will then face the uphill struggle of involving Iraq's Shia majority - moderate or radical - in a future administration. The US-led administration should also be warned that Shia clerics have drawn their own conclusion from the 1920s revolt - and are confident this uprising will last longer. A key part of the revolt was with Karbala, the family’s from all backgrounds fought together such as the Al-Alawad and the koumouna family both fought ruthlessly and showed great strength against the British. The Al-Alawad family was referred to a lot by Miss Bell in her letters such as the letters from Baghdad. Karbala was carnage, many families were shipped to prison camps on different islands. Some returned, but some did not survive. Women and their children were alone their men were missing, some ran away to seek refuge, many gathered in their houses so if they died they all died at once. Some families and militiamen came to an agreement with the British that the British would give them land and beautiful houses if they fought with the British.  Revolution in Najaf  A force from the Bani Hassan clan took control of the Kifl region, south of Hilla, which called on the occupying authorities to send a large force called Bertil (Manchester). Al-Raranjia), and when the revolutionaries appeared, orders were issued to shoot at them, then the revolutionaries inferred the location of the force, they cried to crawl over them, after which orders were issued to the British forces to withdraw, after they suffered heavy losses. One of the results of that battle was the evacuation of the British from many regions in Musayyib and Hindi, as well as the joining of the clans of Daghara and Afaf and the liberation of the rest of the surrounding areas, so the rebel clans advanced towards the Tahmaziyya, and in the meantime the Bani Hassan tribe managed to liberate the region of Toureej (the Indian), without resistance. The rebel tribes also headed, led by Umran hajsadon alabbasi , and the rebel attack was fierce, in which they displayed an amazing valor and made great sacrifices, as a result of the attack that the revolutionaries were subjected to by bombing British aircraft, and using all types of weapons, and the masses of the rebel clans headed to the Siddat al-Hindi, promised The British military commander (Haldane) considered this a threat to Baghdad, especially after the rebels attacked the Hilla - Baghdad railway. and Bani Hassan drowned the British battleship Firefly in the Euphrates. The origins of Bani Hassan - Al Abbas belong to the Abbasid Caliphate and they ruled the region independently of the Ottoman Empire since the time of their grandfather Ghazi I الحسناوي يسأل و العباسي يجيب حسين ال علي ال عبيد ص18.  Revolution in Diyala  Revolution in Deltawa = Battles of the Assyrians = As the Assyrian manned force became more disciplined they rendered excellent service; during the Arab rebellion of the 1920s, they displayed, under conditions of the greatest trial, steadfast loyalty to their British officers. In 1920 the Assyrians had given proof of their great discipline and fighting qualities when the Assyrian camps at Mindan and Baquba were attacked by Arab forces, with the Assyrians defeating and driving off the Arabs. British officers claim the Assyrians were veterans and skilled against their enemies, most of the men who signed up to the British army were indeed veterans from the Assyrian war of independence. One officer believes the reason that the Assyrians displayed such excellence was due to the Assyrians believing that they would be given independence after the revolution by the British.  Revolution in Kurdistan  Revolution in Shahrban = It was announced in the town of Shahraban (Miqdadiyah) on 14 August, where Bani Tamim clan attacked the town, people of the town have cooperated with the clan as happened in the town of Khalis, but the governmental Sarai, where the British and the soldiers of the Shabana were staying, failed to surrender to the rebels. After hours of confrontation between the two sides, the rebels managed to take control of the Governmental Sarai (Qushla). In the evening, five Britons serving in the Sarai were killed in the battle.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:51. After controlling the town, the rebels cut off the railway running through the town, In Shahraban after the rebels managed to control the town there was a big conflict between the town elders and the Bani Tamim clan, which resulted in battles between them.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:52. On 7 September, the British troops, led by General Kongham, arrived near the town. Ater an unequal battle between the clans and the British troops, the latter managed to enter the town on 9 September. = Revolution in Khanaqin and Qazelarbat = On 14 August, the Dalw clan, under the leadership of its leader Khesro Bek, attacked the city of Khanaqin. The city was occupied with little resistance. The rebels and those with them looted Dar al-Saray and all the governmental departments in the city. They took down the British flag and took up the Ottoman flag. The rebels appointed Khurshid Bek as the ruler of the city.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:74. The clans of Qazarbat also attacked the British, occupied the town and looted its building of the governmental Sarai. On the morning of 16 August, the Khanaqin revolutionists, led by Karim Khurshid Bek, attacked the Bawa Mahmoud camp, where the British army was holed up after the arrival of the reinforcements.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:75. A battle ensued between the two teams, ending with the defeat of the rebels, leaving 15 dead.Haldane - p158. On 19 August, a British force led by Colonel Kaskel arrived in the vicinity of Khanaqin without any resistance. The latter, along with his forces, punished the villages that joined the revolution. The next day the colonel succeeded in conquering Khanaqin. On the evening of 24 August, the siege was lifted from the garrison of Qargan, where British soldiers were holed up, and the governor of Qarlzabat Ahmed Dara had taken refuge there. On 27 August, the British forces took control of the town of Qazelerbat. = Revolution in Kafri = On 22 August, Ibrahim Khan, one of the leaders of the Dalw clan, went with his companions to ascend to the top of Jabal Baba Shah Sawar, overlooking the city of Kafri, and opened fire on the governmental Sarai in the town.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:76. The assistant of the town's ruler, Captain Salmon, went himself to the mountain to negotiate with Ibrahim Khan, and as soon as the former arrived at the mountain, he was surprised by the rebels arresting him. The rebels attacked the town and occupied the governmental Sarai and took down the British flag. As soon as the news of the occupation of the town by the rebels reached Kirkuk's ruler, Major Lunkerk, he moved with his army towards the town. After a bloody battle, the British forces conquered the town.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:77.  Revolution of Zubaa mn Shamr  Revolution in the Muftaq Brigade  Revolution in the Souq al-Sheioukh = On 27 August, the governor of Nasiriyah, Mager Dijbren, who was a former political governor in 1918, visited the town of Suq al- Sheioukh.Wilson: vol2.p371.Where he met with the chiefs of the town and tried to convince them not to join the revolution. As soon as Magoger Digber has returned to the city of Nasiriyah, he wrote a report to the British governor in Baghdad, Arnold Wilson.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:111. The assistant of the political ruler of the town, Captain Platts and his British companions, managed to escape from the town on 1 September by a British steamer anchored there and the ship steered them safely towards Nasiriyah.Haldane - p296. There was no looting for the town of Souq al-Sheioukh, as the rest of the towns of lewaa Muntafiq suffered from looting and destruction of the governmental Sarai. Sheioukh Muhammad Hassan al-Haidar managed to preserve all these properties.علي الوردي ج:5(ب). ص:113. On 4 September, two military ships left Nasiriyah and the two ships arrived at the Hawar, located south of Souq al- Sheioukh. Both were heavily armed by the rebels and a battle between the two sides lasted for approximately half an hour. = Incidents of the city of Nasiriyah  Miscellaneous incidents  Incidents of Tal Afar = incidents of Samarra City = Incidents of anaa  Reasons of the failure of the 1920 revolution =Aftermath 6,000 to 10,000\\"Our last occupation - Gas, chemicals, bombs: Britain has used them all before in Iraq\\", The Guardian, Jonathan Glancey, 19 April 2003, Retrieved 16.05.2012. Iraqis and around 1000 British and Indian soldiers died during the revolt. The RAF flew missions totaling 4,008 hours, dropped 97 tons of bombs and fired 183,861 rounds for the loss of nine men killed, seven wounded and 11 aircraft destroyed behind rebel lines. The revolt caused British officials to drastically reconsider their strategy in Iraq. The revolt cost the British government 40 million pounds, which was twice the amount of the annual budget allotted for Iraq and a huge factor in reconsidering their strategy in Iraq.Vinogradov, Amal. \\"The 1920 Revolt in Iraq Reconsidered: The Role of Tribes in National Politics,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.3, No.2 (Apr. 1972): 138 It had cost more than the entire British-funded Arab rising against the Ottoman Empire in 1917–1918. The new Colonial Secretary, Winston Churchill, decided a new administration was needed in Iraq as well as the British colonies in the Middle East so-called for a large conference in Cairo. In March 1921 at the Cairo Conference, British officials discussed the future of Iraq. The British now wanted to control Iraq through more indirect means, mainly by installing former officials friendly to the British government. They eventually decided to install Faysal ibn Husayn as King of Iraq.Vinogradov, Amal. \\"The 1920 Revolt in Iraq Reconsidered: The Role of Tribes in National Politics,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.3, No.2 (Apr. 1972): 139 Faysal had worked with the British before in the Arab Revolt during World War I and he enjoyed good relations with certain important officials.Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq. Cambridge University Press, 2007, 47 British officials also thought installing Faysal as king would prevent Faysal from fighting the French in Syria and damaging British-French relations. For Iraqis, the revolt served as part of the founding of Iraqi nationalism although this conclusion is debated by scholars. It also showed unprecedented co-operation between Shia and Sunni Muslims, although this co- operation did not last much longer than the end of the revolt.Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq.

The short was released on October 28, 1944, and features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. Title The title is a double play on words. One is the typical pun between \\"hare\\" and \\"hair\\", with the bunny (who was already grey-haired) rendered \\"old and grey\\" for this cartoon. The title also refers to the old song, \\"The Old Gray Mare\\". Some of the lobby cards for this cartoon gave the alternate spelling, The Old Gray Hare. Plot The cartoon starts with Elmer Fudd sitting under a tree, crying over his failure to catch Bugs. The \\"voice of God\\" tells Elmer to keep trying to catch him. Elmer wonders how long it will it take-and is shown exactly how long by being transported \\"far into the future\\" past the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, until reaching the then- distant year of A.D. 2000, after the sound of the gong. This offers the chance to use some contemporary gags with a futuristic twist, as Elmer finds a year 2000 newspaper. One headline says, \\"Smellevision Replaces Television: Carl Stalling Sez It Will Never Work!\\" In sporting news, another headline says, \\"Bing Crosby's Horse Hasn't Come In Yet!\\" (Crosby was known for investing in racehorses that did poorly). Yet another headline, unmentioned, states, \\"Quintuplets Give Birth To Quintuplets\\". By now, both Elmer and Bugs are very old and wrinkled (\\"What's up, prune-face\\", \\"Not so fast, there, Grandpa!\\") - Bugs even has a large white beard and a cane – and lumbago – but their chase resumes. This time, Elmer is armed with an \\"original Buck Rogers lightning- quick rabbit killer\\" gun (with a powerful recoil). After a short chase, at slow speed, due to their ages, Elmer gets the upper hand, shooting Bugs with his ultra-modern weapon, with added Pinball effects and \\"TILT\\". At the moment when it seems Elmer has finally beaten his nemesis, the apparently dying Bugs thinks back to when he and Elmer were much younger. This leads to a flashback sequence with a baby Elmer hunting a baby Bugs – both are still in diapers; Bugs is drinking carrot juice from a baby bottle; Elmer is crawling and toting a pop-gun; and they interrupt their chase to briefly take a baby nap-time together. After the flashback is over, a tearful Bugs starts to dig his own grave, with Elmer getting equally emotional, but Bugs switches places with the weeping and distracted Elmer and cheerfully buries him alive instead. Elmer quips, \\"that pesky wabbit is out of my life forever and ever!\\" However, Bugs suddenly pops in and repeats the popular catchphrase of the \\"Richard Q. Peavey\\" character from The Great Gildersleeve, \\"Well, now, I wouldn't say that,\\" plants a kiss on Elmer, then hands him a large firecracker, lights the fuse and quickly departs. While Elmer shivers and doesn't do anything, the screen immediately fades to black with the firecracker still hissing. The pre- written \\"That's all, Folks!\\" card appears, and the firecracker blows up in a tremendous explosion off-screen, rumbling and shaking the title card, leaving Elmer's fate unknown.

The ending card was replaced with the generic 1947-48 ending card as seen on many other cartoons that credit Warner Bros. as producer. The European Turner print retains the shaking ending card and adds the \\"dubbed\\" notice after the title card shakes. This was the reason why \\"The Old Grey Hare\\" on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4 via Bugs Bunny Superstar used the Associated Artists Productions print. At the time of the inclusion of Bugs Bunny Superstar, the majority on the set were American Turner prints.

Hypselosaurus was first described in 1846, but was not formally named until 1869, when Phillip Matheron named it under the binomial Hypselosaurus priscus. The holotype specimen includes a partial hindlimb and a pair of caudal vertebrae, and two eggshell fragments were found alongside these bones. Because of the proximity of these eggshells to the fossil remains, many later authors, including Matheron and Paul Gervais, have assigned several eggs from the same region of France all to Hypselosaurus, although the variation and differences between these eggs suggest that they do not all belong to the same taxon. Hypselosaurus has been found in the same formation as the dromaeosaurids Variraptor and Pyroraptor, the ornithopod Rhabdodon, and the ankylosaurian Rhodanosaurus, as well as indeterminate bones from other groups. Discovery Restoration In 1846, Pierre Philippe Émile Matheron, a French geologist and paleontologist, described several large bones from Provence, France. In the spring of 1869, Matheron formally described these remains, including a partial femur, fibula and possible tibia and a pair of associated caudal vertebrae, as the holotype specimen of a new taxon, Hypselosaurus priscus. Among the bones, portions of the femur shaft are not preserved, along with a majority of the tibia, while both the fibula and vertebrae are entirely preserved. The layer the fossils came from is likely from the late Late Cretaceous, specifically 70 million years ago. Since its original description, several specimens have been referred to Hypselosaurus. One of these, originally described in 1957 by Albert de Lapparent, includes a caudal vertebra, as well as another vertebra described in 1960 by Bataller. In 1993, a review of European sauropods stated that Hypselosaurus was a nomen dubium, and that its holotype could not be verifiably distinguished from other sauropods in the same, and many other, regions. Based on this, the material that was referred to Hypselosaurus by several other authors would have to be considered an intermediate titanosaur. In addition to the holotype skeleton, Matheron described two fragments of a spherical or ellipsoid fossil in 1869. These fragments were studied for some time by Matheron and his contemporary French paleontologists, and the only probable conclusion was that they were fragments of eggshells. The eggs were proposed to have been significantly larger than those of Aepyornis when complete, and Matheron suggested that they either were a very large bird egg, or belonged to Hypselosaurus. When originally named, Matheron proposed that Hypselosaurus was an aquatic crocodile, as was suggested for similar taxa like Pelorosaurus, Cetiosaurus, Streptospondylus and Steneosaurus by their describers. Matheron noted that the long bones, particularly the femur, lacked medullary bone, and thus proposed that it could not have been terrestrial like Iguanodon. Description Scale diagram Main Properties Hypselosaurus was a proposed to be in length, when it was considered a crocodilian, which would have made it one of the largest of the group. However, a modern estimate as a titanosaur has put Hypselosaurus at around , with a very rough weight estimate of . One of the smaller titanosaurs, Neuquensaurus, measures only long. Limb bones The left femur of Hypselosaurus, at in length, is quite eroded, with both the femoral head and the distal condyles being eroded and distorted by sediment. The femur is slightly sinuous, and narrows antero- posteriorly, becoming a subquadrangular oval wide and only long. The internal shaft is fairly spongey, although the internal bone is only loosely attached, and the femur clearly lacks a medullary canal. As preserved, the left tibia is largely incomplete, with only a small section of the shaft, just proximal to the distal condyles, known. Like the femur, there is no medullary canal present, and the spongey internal bone is asymmetrically dense. Few other features can be identified, among those the dimensions and cross-section of the bone. The tibia is ovoid in cross-section, with the anterior diameter long, and wide. The fibula, at in length, corresponds well with the size of the femur and tibia. The fibula is approximately an equilateral triangle in cross-section, with the inner face slightly concave and outer face convex. The flatter surface of the fibula is wide, and opposite ridge protrudes from this. Vertebrae Two caudal vertebrae were preserved, although there would have been a much larger number in the tail. Both bones are nearly identical in every feature, but the anterior has is slightly larger dimensions. The vertebrae are not compressed laterally, instead being compressed vertically to a width of and a height of in the posterior vertebra. Both vertebrae are procoelous, with the anterior articular face being concave, and the posterior face being convex. The larger vertebra is at its widest, but it narrows towards the middle of its length until it is only wide. Both vertebrae preserved the zygapophyses, articular processes that connect the consecutive vertebrae. The vertebrae are overall very similar to those of Pelorosaurus Palaeobiology=Eggs Referred eggs Eggs attributed to Hypselosaurus by Matheron and Paul Gervais have been found in France since 1846, and were the earliest dinosaur eggs actually discovered, although they were not recognized as being dinosaurian for several decades. The eggs are unusually large; measuring at around in length. Age determination studies performed on the fossilized remains have been inconclusive, with results ranging from a few decades to several hundred years. Eggs with abnormally thin shells have been attributed to Hypselosaurus priscus. Some experts have speculated that this was the cause of the species' extinction, with vegetation changes, climatic change and overcrowding being the original impetus for the shell thinning. However, there are alternative explanations for the thin eggshell not dependent on pathology. Later researchers found evidence that the eggs in question successfully hatched. Some researchers postulated that the thinner \\"Hypselosaurus priscus\\" eggshells came from different taxa than the thicker eggshells, and subsequent researchers have come to support this idea. Another potential explanation for variation in eggshell thickness is that the thinner eggs were laid by younger individuals than the thicker shell eggs laid by older individuals or that it was a consequence of natural variations of eggshell thickness within a single species. Ecology Hypselosaurus has been found only in the Grès à Reptiles Formation, in the Provence region of southern France. This formation, dating to the early Maastrichtian approximately 70 mya, has provided fossils of several different groups of dinosaurs. The theropods Variraptor and Pyroraptor, both considered to be within the family Dromaeosauridae, have been found in the Grés á Reptiles Formation, in addition to the nodosaurid ankylosaurian Rhodanosaurus (a dubious genus); a bone fragment potentially belonging to Abelisauridae; and the rhabdodontid ornithopod Rhabdodon. Although the material between Variraptor and Pyroraptor cannot be compared, and they may in fact belong to the same taxon, there are at least two separate dromarosaurids present in the formation. In addition, a new titanosaur, Atsinganosaurus was described from the formation, based on several dorsal vertebrae. There are also indeterminate crocodilians known from the same strata as Hypselosaurus, although they are only represented by unnamed fragments.

Hebert Candies is headquartered in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts in a Tudor stone mansion off Route 20. The \\"candy mansion\\" is the company's sole retail outlet and candy manufacturing facility and has become a destination for locals and tourists alike. Company history Hebert Candies was founded in 1917 when Frederick E. Hebert purchased a copper kettle, knife, table iron, and thermometer for $11.00. In 1946, Mr. Hebert purchased a Tudor stone mansion on Route 20 (the major route connecting Central Massachusetts with Boston) in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts and moved his candy-making operations there. As a result, Hebert Candies became the first roadside confectioner in the entire United States. In 1956, after tasting white-coat candies while traveling in Europe, Hebert introduced white chocolate to the United States, and was the first to do so. Frederick Hebert and his two sons Gerald and Raymond Hebert successfully grew the business to nine retail outlets in the New England area and shipped candy around the world. Later, Gerald would buy out his brother Raymond and assume sole ownership. Gerald Hebert's sons Ronald, Richard, Frederick, Jr. and daughter Dianne developed the candy bar fund raising business for Hebert Candies. They later sold millions of candy bars to organizations in United States and Canada. Hebert Candies was acquired in August 2005 and continues its retail operation and manufacturing facilities at the Candy Mansion. Previously in 2004, Hebert Candies had sold the chocolate bar manufacturing equipment and fundraising portion of the company to LaMontagne of Canada. LaMontagne and the new owner of Hebert's, Pete Perkins of Sabrosa Foods, could not come to terms and subsequently LaMontagne severed ties and ceased production of chocolate bars labeled for Hebert Candies. In 2005, investment firm Longmeadow Capital Partners LLC acquired Hebert Candies. Along with this acquisition, the candy maker launched its melon-colored packaging as part of a rebranding campaign aimed at giving Hebert products a fresher, more modern look. The aim was to refresh its image, boost sales and snag online business as a \\"premium affordable\\" candy maker in New England. In the Spring of 2012 Hebert Candies became part of American Gourmet Group, LLC which conducts a wholesale gourmet food and spa gift basket business and which is also a Longmeadow Capital Partners, LLC company. American Gourmet Group, LLC wholesales its gift baskets to national retailers on-line and in-store. It also distributes its gift baskets in the promotional products industry under the trade name, Gifted Expressions. As to the two businesses coming together, Sheila Shechtman, CEO of American Gourmet, said \\"our goal is to marry Gifted Expressions' creativity, differentiation and customer focus with Hebert's capacity to manufacture artisanal and promotional branded chocolates and gifts.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official website Category:Shrewsbury, Massachusetts ","title":"Hebert Candies"},{"id":"3562231","text":"Maurice Beddow Bayly (26 March 1887 – 22 June 1961) was an English physician, anti-vivisection activist, and anti-vaccination campaigner.

In 1922 he issued a fatwa telling his followers and all Shiites in Iraq not to participate in the upcoming elections, so that they would not give legitimacy to a government established by occupation forces. Shiites, Sunnis, Christians and many minorities answered the calls of Sheikh Mahdi Al-Khalissi and did not participate in the elections. This led to the failure of the elections. The British attempted to deport Al-Khalissi to Bombay, India, but a large group of Indian Muslims arrived at the ports, forcing the British to leave Al-Khalissi on the ship and transfer him elsewhere, for fear of him becoming a leader to the Indian community. He was then transferred to a port in Aden. There he received an invitation from Sharif Hussein, ruler of Mecca, to attend Hajj (Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca). After Hajj, Al-Khalissi received an invitation from the Iranian minister of foreign affairs Mohammed Mosaddeq to come to Iran, where many religious leaders from Najaf would be waiting for him. Sheikh Mahdi Al-Khalissi was welcomed at the Iranian port of Bushehr, but an official of the Iranian Oil Company attempted to assassinate him by firing ten shots at him. Later, Al-Khalissi rejected King Faisal's offer for exiled religious leaders to return to Iraq, providing they did not interfere in politics. In 1925, Al-Khalissi suddenly died in the city of Mashhad. It was claimed that he died of disease, but many of his followers believed that he was poisoned by the British consul in Mashhad.

His Amharic novel Love to the Grave (Amharic: ፍቅር እስከ መቃብር; Fəqər əskä Mäqabər, 1968) is considered a classic of modern Ethiopian literature. Biography He was born in the Endodam Kidane Miheret section of the Gojam Debre markos lower parts, the son of an Orthodox priest, Abba Alemayehu Solomon and his mother Desta alemu. He grew up with his mother. As a boy, he began his education within the system of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, studying at the monasteries of Debre Elias, Debre Werq, and Dima Giorgis where he finally graduated in Qine(type of extended Ethiopian orthodox church education). Later, he moved to Addis Ababa where he attended several schools, including the Swedish mission school (1925–27) and later at the Tafari Makonnen School for further education of the secular sort (EthioView 12 December 2003). He wrote his first play during this period, YeHabeshan yewedehuala Gabcha (The marriage of habesha and its backwardness) which displayed remarkably mature style. In the early 1930s Hadis returned to Gojam and worked as a customs clerk and school headmaster before moving to a teaching position at Debre Markos. Haddis Alemayehu fought during the Italian- Ethiopian war for colonialism (1935–36) until he was captured and sent to the Island of Ponza in the western Mediterranean and then to the island of Lipari, near Sardinia. Freed by allied forces Haddis finally returned to Ethiopia (1943). After brief stints in the department of Press and Propaganda and Ministry of Foreign Affaires, he became the Ethiopian consul in Jerusalem(1945–46), where he stayed for about two years. There he met and married Kibebe-tsaehay Belay, who had lived and had been brought up in Jerusalem. Haddis then served as a delegate to the international communications conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey (1946). Afterwards, he received a posting to the Ethiopian mission in Washington, D.C. and at the United Nations (1946–50). His next assignment was in the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry, first as General Director and then as Vice Minister. During the 1956–1960s he worked as Ethiopian representative to UN. After his return Haddis briefly worked at the Ministry of Education (1960) followed by appointment as Ambassador to Britain and Netherlands (1960–65). After his recall to Ethiopia, Haddis, who was not in good health, preferred not to enter into government service. Reluctantly, he agreed to become a minister of Planning and Development (1965–66) and also served in the Ethiopian Senate (1968–74). During the era of the first two years of Derg regime (a newly brought military government taking the advantage of mass revolution), Haddis served as a member of the advisory body that had been created to replace the dissolved parliament. However he declined the Derg's offer to become Prime Minister, thus removing himself from any meaningful governmental roles. In the meantime he returned to his literature career when he published Fikr Eske Mekabr, his famous novel about love in a feudal Ethiopia. Not only this, he had written Wongelegnaw Dagna (the criminal judge) and yelemezat (sweet only in dreams) and others. He was eventually awarded an honorary doctorate by Addis Ababa University.

He ruled from Biograd with Godemir as his Ban. Biography=Early period Stephen Držislav was a son of king Michael Krešimir II and Queen Helen of Zadar. Helen acted as regent for the young king from 969 until her death on 8 October 976. During Byzantine emperor Basil II's war against Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria, Stephen Držislav allied with the Byzantines. After Basil managed to defend every single Adriatic coastal city during Samuil's rampage towards Zadar in 986, the cities were returned to Croatian control. Samuil, however, invaded central Croatia and conquered the territories of Bosnia between the Drina and Bosna rivers. Samuil pursued some of his cousins during the war and they often sought help in Croatia. King Držislav took fourteen of them, gave them hospitality and a residence near Klis. According to Martin, the Archbishop of Split, in 994 they collected money for the construction of the Orthodox St. Michael church in Solin.Rački: Documenta, page 23., 24. In an effort to compensate and award Držislav for his alliance, the Eastern Roman Emperor named Stephen Držislav Patriarch and an Exarch of Dalmatia, which gave him formal authority over the Theme of Dalmatia. Stephen Držislav received royal insignia as an act of recognition from the Byzantine Emperor.Thomas the Archdeacon: Historia Salonitana, caput 13. Držislav built on his parents' feats and secured sovereignty over the Theme of Dalmatia, lost to Byzantium under Trpimir II. The Theme of Dalmatia at that time included the towns (but not the hinterland) of Krk, Osor, Rab, Zadar, Trogir and Split. He also delegated much of his authority to his powerful governors (bans). Rule The 13th-century work Historia Salonitana by Thomas the Archdeacon notes that Zachlumia (or Chulmie) was a part of the Kingdom of Croatia, before and after Stephen Držislav. In 996, Venetian Doge Pietro II Orseolo stopped paying tax for safe passage to the Croatian King after a century of peace, renewing old hostilities. Stephen Držislav, together with the Neretvians, fought the Venetian fleet, but with little success. He sent delegates demanding resumption of the tribute, but the Doge demurred and the war continued. Before the end of his reign, Stephen Držislav gave Svetoslav, his oldest son, the title of Duke and Svetoslav became his co-ruler. Držislav was preparing Svetoslav to be his successor. It is probable that Svetoslav ruled concurrently with his father during the 990s. Stone panels from the altar of a 10th-century church in Knin, reveal the following inscription in Latin: CLV DUX HROATOR IN TE PUS D IRZISCLV DUCE MAGNU. In English, this means: Svetoslav, Duke of the Croats at the time of Drzislav the Great Duke (). The stone panels are kept at the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments in Split. Držislav's rule was one of the longest of Kings in Croatia, spanning nearly three decades.

It includes nuclear-powered submarines: five Han class attack submarines and China's single Xia class submarine ballistic missile submarine, all based at Qingdao.

According to 2005 data there are 3,221 people living in Venta. It is situated along the Venta River, Kuršėnai-Mažeikiai highway, and a railroad connecting Mažeikiai with Šiauliai (the train station is called Akmenė). This makes Venta better situated than Naujoji Akmenė, the capital of the district. The town grew after World War II together with a lime factory which later produced bricks. At its peak the factory employed about 1,000 people. The city was formed when Bauskas and Purviai villages were joined in 1966. After the 1990 declaration of independence, the factory faced severe financial difficulties while shifting from planned economy to free market. The factory's departments were made into separate companies. Some went bankrupt and their buildings were destroyed; others were privatized. In 1999 a public company, \\"Naujasis kalcitas\\" (English: The New Calcite; the only manufacturer of quicklime in Lithuania, supplying 50-55% of the domestic market) purchased and reconstructed a remaining lime burning technology line with rotary kiln. Recently a new heating facility using natural gas was built to provide heat for the city. Culture A grocery shop in Venta The city has a high school (established 1907), which started with about 20 students. Studies lasted 4 years and commenced in November when all field jobs have finished. Classes were held in Russian. In 1940, as the number of students grew to 40, the school moved to a new building and was renamed Dabikinė Elementary School. The building belonged to a railroad company and was not fitted for school, but the war prevented the reconstruction. In 1949 the number of students reached 120 and the school was reorganized into a 7-year school. The railroad building was too small and the school was forced to rent two other buildings more than apart. In 1953-54 the school was reorganized again as a high school. In 1960 a spacious new building was opened. At that time the school had 330 students and about 20 teachers. In 1972 a new expansion was built with a gym and 14 new classrooms. The school currently employs about 50 teachers. It is known for being active in various projects and for students who do well on various national science Olympics. In 1961 a public library was established in Venta. It started with 6,150 books and grew to 18,000 in 2000. In 1996 it won the second place in \\"Biblioteka - kultūros centras\\" (English: Library - cultural center) contest organized by the Open Society Fund Lithuania. A club, \\"Ventos mūzų malūnas\\", was established by the library and gathers people interested in art and poetry. Juozas Miltinis (1907–1994) was born in what is now Venta. Music traditions Venta music school Venta music school has a traditional Lithuanian music assemble \\"Ventukai\\". Its members are mostly local youth ranging from 9 to 20 years old. In 2004 it became famous after appearing in a popular song contest Nacionalinė Muzikos Lyga (commonly abbreviated as NML; English: National Music League) on LNK, one of the biggest TV stations in Lithuania. Critics expected that they would be voted off in the first round, but they reached the finals and won the contest on May 29. It received the first prize of 275,000 litas. Later that year they released a CD, Keliaujam su daina (We Are Travelling With Songs), with 16 fast, upbeat songs. They have made appearances across Lithuania and in other countries including Latvia, Germany and Italy. In 2004 they made their one-thousandth concert in Venta.

Surrounding states were also affected to a lesser extent. The fires were triggered by a combination of record-high temperatures, drought, and high winds in the region. The situation was exacerbated, at least in Texas, by plentiful rains in recent years. The rains encouraged vegetation growth, which then dried out over the winter drought leaving more potential fuel. The unusually dry conditions have been attributed to La Niña. At Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, only of rain fell in the first two months of the year. On January 1, fires continued to develop throughout the two states. By January 3, many of the fires were reported to be under control; but outbreaks continued through January, February, and March. In Texas, 12 people were killed. Eight Texas towns were evacuated in March 2006. From December 26, 2005 to April 3, 2006, Texas suffered 11,048 wildfires which burned and destroyed 423 homes. In Oklahoma, 869 homes were damaged; 300 of them were destroyed. As of April 5, 2006, there had been over 22,564 wildfires across the country in the year to date, burning . Texas governor Rick Perry declared the entire state a disaster area, describing it as a \\"tinderbox\\", and called for firefighters and fire equipment to combat the blazes. In addition, the governor of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, declared a disaster and pleaded for federal aid. On January 10, President Bush declared several Oklahoma counties to be disaster areas; the list was amended to include 26 counties by late March. Heavy rains in late March promised at least temporary relief to the affected areas. Governor Henry lifted the burn ban (which had been instated in November) throughout Oklahoma on March 22, but reinstated it for most counties only five days later, on March 27. Much of Texas was also placed under a burn ban. Selected major fires=Callisburg, Texas A fire in a rural area in Callisburg and Walnut Bend, near the Oklahoma border in Cooke County, was still burning on December 29. There were at least 10 to 30 buildings destroyed, plus more outbuildings. At least of land were scorched. One person was killed in the area due to the fires. Cross Plains, Texas On December 27, 2005, 116 homes were destroyed by a large fire in and around Cross Plains. On December 29, 2005 the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) listed 85 single-family homes, 25 mobile homes and six apartment units as being destroyed. An additional 36 homes were damaged. The 120-year-old First United Methodist Church of Cross Plains was also destroyed. Two people died after being trapped in their houses. The fire started five miles (8 km) west of the city along Highway 36 and westerly winds of up to 30 mph (50 km/h) spread the flames into town burning a total of of land. The fire spared the near-century- old house (now a museum) of Robert E. Howard, author of the Conan the Barbarian books. Mustang, Oklahoma Several houses were burned in the area of Mustang, just outside Oklahoma City in Canadian County. The cause was unknown, but several houses were burned by the flames. At least of land were scorched. Guthrie, Oklahoma On the evening of January 1, a major fire developed in a suburban area near Guthrie (near Oklahoma City). Many buildings—presumably single-family homes—were burned, according to television coverage. Two neighborhoods were evacuated. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Fires broke out intermittently within city limits. One grass fire early in January received national attention as it consumed several buildings. On April 6 and April 7, high winds with gusts of 40-50 mph created high potential for dangerous fires. At least 18 fires developed in Oklahoma City on these days. Outbreaks also occurred in the Texas Panhandle and elsewhere in Oklahoma, burning six homes in Kingfisher and forcing the evacuation of Cement, Reydon, and Cheyenne. Part of Oklahoma City was evacuated on April 7 when a fire from the previous day was revived by high winds.

The parish lies on the borders with Shropshire and Wales, and had a population of 1,673 at the 2011 Census. The name derives from Old French and means \\"bad passage\\".  History =Roman There is no evidence for Roman settlement in Malpas, but it is known that the Roman Road from Bovium (Tilston) and Mediolanum (Whitchurch) passes through the village. Mercian  Dedications to St Oswald are thought to be associated with Æthelræd II (879–911), also known as Earl Aethelred of Mercia and Æthelflæd of Mercia (911–918); they are known to have encouraged the growth of this cult along the Welsh border in places such as Hereford and Shrewsbury. This may indicate that Malpas was not a Norman 'New Town', but an Anglo-Saxon burh. Medieval (Norman 1066–1154) After the Norman conquest of 1066 Malpas is recorded as being called Depenbech and is mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086 as belonging to Robert FitzHugh, Baron of Malpas. Malpas and other holdings were given to his family for defensive services along the Welsh border. The Cholmondeley family who still live locally at Cholmondeley Castle descended from Robert FitzHugh: Richard de Malpas, son of John de Malpas (originator of the Cholmondeley family who lived at Depenbach), married Letitia FitzHugh, daughter of Robert FitzHugh.Burke's Peerage and Gentry, online http://www.burkes-peerage.net A concentrated line of castles protected Cheshire's western border from the Welsh; these included motte-and-bailey castles at Shotwick, Dodleston, Aldford, Pulford, Shocklach, Oldcastle and Malpas. The earthworks of Malpas Castle are still to be found to the north of St. Oswald's Church. Medieval (Plantagenet 1154–1485) Malpas became more important when the western hundreds of Cheshire were detached to become part of Wales. By the late 13th century, Malpas became the most important settlement in the southern part of Broxton hundred. Develops significantly around the motte and church and becomes a market town – Malpas was granted a Market Charter for a weekly market and annual fair in 1281. The present church was built in the second half of the 14th century on the site of an earlier one, of which nothing remains. However, there is a list of earlier rectors. Extensive alterations were made in the late 15th century. The roof was removed, the side walls reduced in height and rebuilt with the current windows while the nave arcade was raised to its current height. The town retains its general layout established in the medieval period. A possible reason for Malpas not undergoing intensive development is that Whitchurch, a major market town, was just away. Tudor – Elizabethan (1485–1603) The seventh son of Sir Randolph Brereton of Shocklach and Malpas, Sir William Brereton, became chamberlain of Chester, and groom of the chamber to Henry VIII. He was beheaded on 17 May 1536 for a suspected romantic affair with Anne Boleyn. These accusations may have been politically motivated. Civil War and the Stuarts (1603–1714) Cheshire was strategically very important during the civil war as it controlled the north–south movement of troops from the west of the Pennines to the east of the Clwydian range – Chester, as the main port to Ireland was supremely important as Charles I had an army there. Another Sir William Brereton of Malpas and Shocklach was one of two Parliamentarian Generals responsible for the defeat of the Royalist Irish reinforcements at the Battle of Nantwich in January 1644 and later the siege of Chester, capturing it in February 1646. Second World War In 1940 during the Second World War, the Czechoslovak Army in exile was encamped in Cholmondeley Park. Transport The village was once served by the Whitchurch and Tattenhall Railway or Chester-Whitchurch Branch Line. The station was closed along with the entire line under the Beeching Axe in the 1960s.

According to the recent Universal Primary Education (UPE) survey, the total number of children in the age group 5–7 years is 104,498Education Department Survey for UPE in 2005 in which 56,937 are boys and 47,561 are girls. Due to the limited access, the number of out-of-school children among the age group 5–7 years is 25,169. Almost 24% children of the total (age group 5–7 years) are out of school, in which 19% are boys and 30% are girls. These figures also include the dropout students of both genders.  Economy  The area has a weak agriculture infrastructure with no industry. The economy is completely based on the remittances sent back to the area by people (mainly males) living in the Middle East.  People  The people of Timergara are mainly Pashtun. The main tribes are Ibrahimkhel, Utmankhel and Umarkhel. Tor Baba (Abdur Rahim Khan), Timergara Babaje and Jaloo Baba were the prominent religious figures of this area. Author Suleman Shahid discussed it very briefly in his recent book Ghumnam Riasat. Abdur Rahim Khan migrated from Mandal (Bajawar Agency) in the late seventeenth century and settled in Timergara. He was known as Tor Baba for his piousness. Abdur Rahim Khan and Akhund Ilyas (d. 1676) were disciples of Shaikh Adam Binori. The Mandal (clan of Utmankheil) in Timergara or mostly called Shaikhan are the descendants of Baba Abdur Rahim Khan.  Climate  The summer season is hot and arid while the winter is cold and wet. A steep rise in temperature occurs from May to June, and then is very hot from July to the end of August, but during September the weather becomes cooler, especially at night. A rapid fall of temperature occurs from October onwards. The coldest months are December and January. The mean minimum temperature recorded for the month of January is −8 °C. Rainfall mostly occurs in the months of July, August, December, January and February. Towards the end of cold weather, there are occasional thunderstorms and hailstorms. Timergara is equally affected by global warming and climatic changes. In 2010, along with snowfall, heavy floods occurred which resulted in heavy damage to the infrastructure of the city. In March 2014, the Panjkora river's level began rising again, which was a threat to the Balambat bridge.  Food  Popular foods are fish and beef cooked as chapli kabab, seekh kabab, and tikka. A tandoor (oven) for baking bread is present in many houses. Many inhabitants eat lobya (beans), saag and juwar doday (bread of maize). Lassi and saag with sookrak (sweet bread of maize) are also offered to guests.  Dress and ornaments  The people generally wear typical Pashtun dress. During the winter season, men wear a chadar (a long piece of cloth, mostly used to make the body warm) around the body along with kameez (shirt) and shalwar. Women typically wear shalwar kameez and burqa. A Chitrali woolen cap is used in winter, while a typical light Dirojee cap is worn in the summer. Sapley (leather sandals) are the most common footwear among men.  Festivals and fairs  Festivals and fairs are a part of the Pashtun culture. The most important festivals are the two Eids (Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr). Apart from that, most youngsters hike in the hills of Kumrat, Lowari Pass, Laram, Shahi and Oshery in pleasant weather.  Population size and growth  When Timergara was declared as the district headquarters of Dir, migration of the people to the city increased. The population of Timergara has increased about threefold since 1990.  Transport  Timergara connects Bajawar, Dir Upper and Chitral to the rest of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. Timergara has two busy bypass roads that connect different areas. The nearest airport is Peshawar International Airport, about ninety-eight miles away. The buses, taxis and private vehicles are the main means of transport.  Sports  There is no proper facility available for players to play professional sports. The area has produced some prominent players in different sports i.e. Israrullah (cricket), kamrankhan(karate kyukushin),Murtaza Ahmad (hockey) and Irfan Ahmad (badminton). These players have represented provincial and regional teams in different games. The youngsters have a great passion for sports like cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, and hockey. Rest House Ground and FC Ground (Balambat) are the two main sporting events sites. The residents have made small grounds for sports facilities on the banks of rivers and as well as at the bottom of mountains.  Health facilities  The main healthcare facility is District Headquarters Hospital Timergara. There are many more private hospitals and a number of hospitals available for ladies' treatment. MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières), an international NGO, is supporting parts of the District Headquarters Hospital e.g. Maternity, Accident, Emergency and Newborn Unit. The pioneer practitioner of this area was the late Dr. Burhan Uddin (1942–2009). He provided primary health care to the people of this area when no hospital existed.

She was sunk on the night of 3 November 1916 at the entrance to Carlingford Lough, Louth, Ireland after being hit amidships by the coalship Retriever. 97 lives were lost that night and the only survivor was James Boyle – a fireman on the Retriever and former caretaker of Warrenpoint Town Hall and a non-swimmer. The captain on the Connemara was Captain G. H. Doeg. The captain on the Retriever was Patrick O'Neill.

The accident itself  * Accident Date & time: 3 November 1916 * Conditions: Gale force winds from SWS against a strong ebb tide of some 8 knots. Mountainous seas & dark conditions. * Retriever Origin: Left Garston @ 4 a.m. on Friday * Retriever Destination: Newry * Connemara Origin: Left Greenore (her berth) @ 8 p.m. * Connemara Destination: Holyhead The outbound Connemara met the inbound Retriever approximately a half-mile beyond the Carlingford bar. The bar in Carlingford is marked by Haulbowline lighthouse. Beyond the bar is the \\"cut\\" or channel, which in Carlingford's case is very narrow, being only about 300 yards wide. This lack of space allows for very little manoeuvrability for passing vessels. Both vessels were showing dimmed lights, for fear of U-boats. Their masters were on their respective bridges, and there was no evidence to indicate they were not alert. The watch at the Haulbowline lighthouse, seeing the ships too close for comfort, fired off rockets in warning. However, the atrocious conditions had caused the Retrievers cargo to list. She was fighting both wind, tide and cargo inertia. She hit the Connemara on the port side, penetrating her hull to the funnel. Immediately Master O' Neill reversed engines and the Retriever swung wide. The Connemara however was terribly ripped below the waterline on the port side, from bow to amidships. She sank within minutes, her boilers exploding on contact with the cold water. The Retriever, with her bow stove in, took about 20 minutes to sink about 200 yards from the Connemara. Her boilers also exploded on contact with the water.  The sole survivor: James Boyle  * From Summerhill in Warrenpoint * He was a fireman and was also the caretaker of Warrenpoint Town Hall * Was below deck of the Retriever at the time of the accident * A non-swimmer!

A very small selection are here: * Patrick Conlon, a Dundalk railwayman, was travelling to Wigan with two female cousins – Mrs Lilly Fillingham (plus her 2 children Robert and Jane) and Miss Maggie Glassbrook. His body was initially misidentified as he was wearing the jacket of his brother Tommy. * There were many young female victims. They were more than likely travelling over to England to work in the munitions factories during World War I. * Mr Patrick J. Kearney, and his sister, Miss Catherine Kearney, children of the Principal of Drumilly National School, Whitecross were waiting at the Edward St Station in Newry. Mr Kearney had recently completed his training in Waterford for national school teaching, Miss Kearney assisted her father in the school. They were going to meet a married sister who was coming from America. While waiting for the train to Greenore they were told by Sergeant Fitzpatrick, who was always on duty at the station, that the Greenore boat on which they meant to embark might not sail as the night was so rough. After some hesitation Mr Kearney tossed a penny on the Waiting Room table and on the strength of the result decided to make the journey. * Rose Anne Maguire aged 25 yrs and her sister Margaret Alice (Maggie) Maguire1911 censusage 19 years were born on a mountain farm located in Aughoo, Co Fermanagh. Their parents were Philip and Mary Maguire and they had had 10 children by 1911. The older girl had been working in America but came home to collect her younger sister to take her to America. Unfortunately their names were never officially recorded. They were travelling to connect with a New York bound ship in Liverpool. Rose was already living in the states and had come to bring Margaret Alice over. Rose was due to be married and was meeting her fiance in Liverpool. He travelled on to the States but returned to visit Fermanagh in the 1970s and contacted Roses brother Patrick Joseph Maguire. In all the years he still remembered the girl he had loved 60 years before.Memoir of family member  Memorial & poetry  * In Dublin, the tragedy inspired a 16-year-old schoolboy, C.A. McWilliam, to write a poem – The Collision of the Connemara and Retriever * On 3 November 1981 the pupils of Kilkeel High School erected a stone memorial in Kilkeel Graveyard in memory of the victims of the tragedy. * Listen to the Song 'Lovely Alice' The Connemara and the Retriever song 'written by Pauline McQuaid Shields, the Great Granddaughter of James an Alice Curran on Youtu.be.

The dotted line in red represents a cut with three crossing edges. The dashed line in green represents one of the minimum cuts of this graph, crossing only two edges. In graph theory, a minimum cut or min-cut of a graph is a cut (a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets) that is minimal in some sense. Variations of the minimum cut problem consider weighted graphs, directed graphs, terminals, and partitioning the vertices into more than two sets. The weighted min-cut problem allowing both positive and negative weights can be trivially transformed into a weighted maximum cut problem by flipping the sign in all weights. __TOC__ Without terminal nodes The minimum cut problem in undirected, weighted graphs can be solved in polynomial time by the Stoer-Wagner algorithm. In the special case when the graph is unweighted, Karger's algorithm provides an efficient randomized method for finding the cut. In this case, the minimum cut equals the edge connectivity of the graph. A generalization of the minimum cut problem without terminals is the minimum -cut, in which the goal is to partition the graph into at least connected components by removing as few edges as possible. For a fixed value of , this problem can be solved in polynomial time, though the algorithm is not practical for large . With terminal nodes When two terminal nodes are given, they are typically referred to as the source and the sink. In a directed, weighted flow network, the minimum cut separates the source and sink vertices and minimizes the total weight on the edges that are directed from the source side of the cut to the sink side of the cut. As shown in the max-flow min-cut theorem, the weight of this cut equals the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source to the sink in the given network. In a weighted, undirected network, it is possible to calculate the cut that separates a particular pair of vertices from each other and has minimum possible weight. A system of cuts that solves this problem for every possible vertex pair can be collected into a structure known as the Gomory–Hu tree of the graph. A generalization of the minimum cut problem with terminals is the -terminal cut, or multiterminal cut. This problem is NP-hard, even for k=3. Applications Graph partition problems are a family of combinatorial optimization problems in which a graph is to be partitioned into two or more parts with additional constraints such as balancing the sizes of the two sides of the cut. Segmentation-based object categorization can be viewed as a specific case of normalized min-cut spectral clustering applied to image segmentation. Due to max-flow min-cut theorem, 2 nodes' Minimum cut value is equal to their maxflow value. In this case, some algorithms used in maxflow problem could also be used to solve this question. Number of minimum cuts A graph with n vertices can at the most have \\\\binom{n}{2} = \\\\frac{n (n-1)}{2} distinct minimum cuts. This bound is tight in the sense that a (simple) cycle on n vertices has exactly \\\\frac{n (n-1)}{2} minimum cuts.

The station is owned by Gois Broadcasting, LLC, and airs a tropical music radio format. There are actually two transmitters with the call sign WLLH. Both operate at 1,000 watts using non-directional antennas on AM 1400. One is in Lowell, and there was a synchronous transmitter in Lawrence, together forming the two Ls in the call sign. (There were once plans for a transmitter in Haverhill, — the H — but it was not built.) The station has shut off the Lowell transmitter and change the City of License to Lawrence.https://www.fybush.com/nerw-20190624/ North East Radio Watch 6/24/2019 The Lowell transmitter is on the Merrimack River, next to the VFW Highway.Radio-Locator.com/WLLH The Lawrence transmitter is about 10 miles away, on Common Street, near the Lawrence Police Department Headquarters. WLLH is also heard on FM translator W236CU at 95.1 MHz in Lowell, with its 70 watt transmitter located off Holmes Road.Radio-Locator.com/W236CU The station uses its translator frequency in its moniker, \\"Mega 95.1 FM.\\"  History  The station that now operates as WLLH signed on the air in October 1926 as WAGS. It was only powered at 5 watts, broadcasting on 1200 kilocycles, and was licensed to Somerville, Massachusetts, near Boston. Its call letters stood for \\"Willow Avenue Garage Station.\\" During September–October 1927, the station moved to Lexington, Massachusetts and it returned to the air on October 27, 1927 as WLEX at 1390 kHz with 50 watts. It was located in the home of part- owner Carl Wheeler. The other owner was Jesse Smith Dodge. The station time- shared with South Dartmouth station WMAF. On November 11, 1928, WLEX moved to 1420 kHz with 100 watts, time-sharing with Boston-based religious station WSSH. When Wheeler's company, the Lexington Air Stations, purchased the license of WBET from the Boston Evening Transcript and moved it from Medford to Lexington in February 1929. The WLEX call letters were transferred to that station (now WVEI in Worcester), with the original WLEX being renamed WLEY. During this time, the stations also operated an experimental television station, W1XAY. WLEY remained at 1420 kHz until 1930, when it moved to 1370 (concurrent with WLEX's move from 1360 kHz to 1410). W1XAY shut down in 1930, and WLEX was sold off in 1931, but the Lexington Air Stations retained WLEY until 1933, when it was purchased by Alfred Moffat, who moved the station to Lowell on October 10, 1934 and changed the call letters to WLLH six days later. Moffat boosted the station's daytime power to 250 watts from a transmitter and studio location at the Rex Center, and affiliated it with the Yankee Network; in 1936, the station also began an affiliation with the Mutual-affiliated Colonial Network. He also began efforts to establish a second transmitter in Lawrence, which signed on the air under special temporary authority with 100 watts on December 1, 1937, with a license for the Lawrence transmitter being issued on March 4, 1941. WLLH moved to 1400 kHz on March 29, 1941 under the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). Ed McMahon began his career in 1942 as an announcer for WLLH. In addition, the station began an FM sister station in 1947, 99.5 WLLH-FM (now WCRB). A company called WLLH, Inc. acquired the stations in 1963.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-107 In the 1960s and 70s, WLLH carried a Top 40 format with local news and weather updates. By the 1980s, the stations moved to a full service adult contemporary sound. But as younger people switched to FM stations for their music, WLLH had to adjust its playlist. By the 1990s, under Arnold Lerner's Merrimack Valley Wireless Talking Machine Company, WLLH had adopted an adult standards format, and was the radio home of the Lowell Spinners minor league baseball team. The station was sold to Mega Communications in 1999, and switched to a simulcast of Spanish-language tropical music station WNFT (1150 AM, soon renamed WAMG) that April; some of WLLH's staff, as well as Spinners games, moved to WCCM (then at 800 AM, now WNNW at 1490 AM). The WAMG simulcast continued after that station moved to 890 AM in 2003, following the sale of 1150 AM (now WWDJ) to Salem Communications. Mega sold WAMG and WLLH to J Sports in 2005. On July 24, the stations returned to English-language programming and switched to ESPN Radio. Most programming was simulcast on both stations, though WLLH again carried Lowell Spinners baseball, replacing WCAP, during the 2007 season; after that season, the team returned to WCAP. WAMG and WLLH discontinued ESPN Radio programming on September 14, 2009. The sports format was dropped, and the stations temporarily went dark. While the station was silent, on October 9, 2009, Merrimack College announced that Merrimack Warriors ice hockey games would be broadcast on WLLH beginning on November 13. WLLH logo prior to the addition of the 95.1 translator WLLH returned to the air with test programming in late October 2009, carrying a pre-recorded loop in Spanish, with Gois Broadcasting launching the current tropical music format soon afterward. Initially operating the station under a local marketing agreement (LMA), Gois purchased WLLH outright in January 2010.

It was a US top ten popular music hit for singer Ray Peterson in 1960 on RCA Victor Records, reaching No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Later that same year, the song was recorded and released by Ricky Valance in the United Kingdom, where it went all the way to the No. 1 spot on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\" has been a hit in 14 countries, and has sold over seven million copies. \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\" is the tragic story of a teenage boy named Tommy who is desperately in love with a girl named Laura. Although they are only teenagers, he wants to marry her, so he enters a stock car race, hoping to win, and use the prize money to buy Laura a wedding ring. The second verse tells how the boy's car overturned and burst into flames. Tommy is fatally injured and his last words are \\"Tell Laura I love her... My love for her will never die.\\" In the final verse, Laura prays inside the chapel, where a church organ is heard, and where she can still hear Tommy's voice intoning the title one more time, before it fades out. Recording history The lyrics of \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\" originally concerned a rodeo, not an automobile race, as composer Jeff Barry was an aficionado of cowboy culture. However, at RCA's instigation, Barry rewrote the song, in order to more closely resemble the No. 1 hit \\"Teen Angel\\". The personnel on the original recording included Al Chernet, Charles Macy, and Sebastian Mure on guitars: Lloyd Trotman on bass; Andrew Ackers on organ; Bob Burns on sax; and Bunny Shawker on drums. Decca Records in England decided not to release Ray Peterson's 1960 recording on the grounds that it was \\"too tasteless and vulgar\\" and destroyed about twenty-five thousand copies that had already been pressed. A cover version by Ricky Valance, released by EMI on the Columbia label, was No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks. Valance's version was initially banned by the BBC who considered it to be in \\"bad taste\\" and expressed concern for copycat activity. The Peterson single was re-released in 1962, following the success of Valance's recording. Other versions In the U.S. a recording by Johnny T. Angel (a.k.a Bill Gilliland) on Bell Records peaked at No. 94 on June 22, 1974. In 1973, Dutch singer Albert West released his 7\\" version which reached No. 8 on the Dutch Top 40. In 1974, Creation released a version which peaked at number 20 in the Australian charts. The story of the song was adapted for stage and turned into Tell Laura I Love Her (The Musical) in 2007 by Richard C. Hague. A Spanish version (\\"Dile a Laura que la quiero\\") was recorded by Chilean singer Ray Palaviccino in 1962 and Spanish group Los HH in 1963. There were also versions in Serbian (\\"Lora, ja te volim\\", by Miodrag Jevremović), Danish (\\"Hils Lillian kærligt\\", by Heaven and \\"Si' til Lis hun er min tøs\\", by Dick Kaysø and Peter Thorup), Dutch (\\"Ik blijf van Laura houden\\", by Charles Tuinenburg and The Melody Strings), Finnish (\\"Laura (sua kauheesti kaipaan)\\" by Hector), French (\\"Dis à Laura\\", by Richard Anthony), German (\\"Das Ende der Liebe\\", by Rex Gildo), Italian (\\"Dite a Laura che l'amo\\", by Michele) and Swedish (\\"Jag Älskar Min Laura\\", by Carli Tornehave). Answer song versions An answer song, \\"Tell Tommy I Miss Him\\" was released by Marilyn Michaels in 1960. It was originally released by RCA Victor Records as a single and is included on the 2007 compilation album The Answer to Everything - Girl Answer Songs of the '60's. In 1961, country singer Skeeter Davis released the same song on her album Here's the Answer. British singer Laura Lee with Orchestra directed by Johnny Keating also recorded a version, released by Triumph Records as a single in the UK in August 1960.

The name derives from \\"Huayang\\" (華陽), an alternate name for Sichuan (the province where it was discovered), and \\"saurus\\", meaning \\"lizard\\". It lived during the Bathonian to Callovian stages, around 165 million years ago, some 20 million years before its famous relative, Stegosaurus appeared in North America. At only 4.5 metres long, it was also much smaller than its famous cousin. Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation, Huayangosaurus shared the local Middle Jurassic landscape with the sauropods Shunosaurus, Datousaurus, Omeisaurus and Protognathosaurus, the ornithopod Xiaosaurus and the carnivorous Gasosaurus. It was found in Huayang in China. Description Restoration Like other stegosaurians, Huayangosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivore with a small skull and a spiked tail. Like its more famous relative, Stegosaurus, Huayangosaurus bore the distinctive double row of plates that characterize all the stegosaurians. These plates rose vertically along its arched back. In Huayangosaurus, the plates were more spike-like than in Stegosaurus. Like Stegosaurus, however, it bore two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail. Huayangosaurus had several types of osteoderms. On its neck, back, and tail were two rows of paired small vertical plates and spikes. On the rear of the tail, pairs of spikes were present forming the so-called \\"thagomizer\\", a defensive weapon. Each flank had a row of smaller osteoderms, culminating in a long shoulder spine in front, curving to the rear. https://www.deviantart.com/scotthartman/art/Huayangosaurus-a-primitive-little- stegosaur-583224076 Huayangosaurus was one of the smallest known stegosaurians, at just 4.5 meters (15 feet) in length. Discovery and species Skull of Huayangosaurus taibaii, on display at the Paleozoological Museum of China. In 1979 and 1980, remains from twelve stegosaurian individual animals were recovered from the Dashanpu Quarry near Zigong in Sichuan. They were named and described by Dong Zhiming, Tang Zilu and Zhou Shiwu in 1982. The type species is Huayangosaurus taibaii. The generic name refers to Huayang, an old name for Sichuan, but at the same time alludes to the Hua Yang Guo Zhi from the Jin Dynasty, the oldest known gazetteer from China. The specific name honours the great Chinese poet Li Bai whose courtesy name was Taibai.Dong, Z., Tang, Z. and Zhou, S.W. (1982). [\\"Note on the new Mid- Jurassic stegosaur from Sichuan Basin, China\\"] (in Chinese). Vertebrata PalAsiatica 20 (1) :83-87 The holotype, IVPP V6728, was recovered from a layer of the lower Shaximiao Formation dating from the Bathonian-Callovian. It consists of a partial skeleton. It contains a relatively complete skull, three neck vertebrae, three back vertebrae, four sacral vertebrae, twenty tail vertebrae, two metatarsals, three phalanges, three plates, a spike and three further osteoderms. Several specimens were referred: ZDM T7001: a more complete skeleton containing a skull, eight cervicals, sixteen dorsals, four sacrals, thirty-five caudals, a complete shoulder girdle, a left humerus, both ilia, a left pubic bone, both ischia, three metatarsals, three phalanges and eleven plates; ZDM T7002: vertebrae; ZDM T7003: vertebrae and a pelvis; ZDM T7004: caudal vertebrae; CV 720: a skull, twenty-eight vertebrae and twenty plates; and CV 721: seven vertebrae. In 2006, Susannah Maidment reviewed the material. In several specimens, ZDM T7002, CV 720 and CV 721, no shared distinguishing features with the holotype could be established; she considered them no longer referable to Huayangosaurus. For CV 720 the reason was that this specimen could not be located in the collection. CV 721 was found to be so different that she suggested it might be a separate taxon.Maidment, S.C., Wei G.-B. & Norman, D.B., 2006, \\"Re-description of the postcranial skeleton of the Middle Jurassic stegosaur Huayangosaurus taibaii\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 26: 944-956 Mounted skeletons of Huayangosaurus are on display at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Zigong and the Municipal Museum of Chongqing in Sichuan Province in China. Classification Size comparison As it is the most basal stegosaurian, it is placed in within its own family Huayangosauridae. It is also morphologically distinct from later (stegosaurid) forms. Its skull was broader and had premaxillary teeth in the front of its mouth. All later stegosaurians lost these teeth.Sereno, P & Z-M Dong (1992). The skull of the basal stegosaur Huayangosaurus taibaii and a cladistic diagnosis of Stegosauria. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 51: 318-343 Palaeobiology Like many other stegosaurians, it had plates all down its back and spikes on its tail. Two large spikes were above its hips, and may have been used for deterring an attack from above (considering as it was fairly short in height compared to later stegosaurians). Its plates were smaller than those of Stegosaurus, with much less surface area. Thus they would have been much less effective heat regulators, one of the postulated functions of plates.

In April 1972, United States Navy SEAL Lieutenant Thomas R. Norris was one of the few remaining SEALs in Vietnam. When Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton was shot down behind enemy lines, aerial combat search and rescue operations failed, leading to the loss of five additional aircraft and the death of 11 or more airmen, two captured, and three more down and needing rescue. Norris was tasked with mounting a ground operation to recover Hambleton, Lieutenant Mark Clark, and Lieutenant Bruce Walker from behind enemy lines. Kiệt was one of five Vietnamese commandos to accompany Norris, and when the others refused to pursue the mission further, volunteered to assist Norris. They successfully brought out two of the three downed airmen from more than behind enemy lines. Rescue operations Kiệt was a member of the Vietnamese frogmen Naval Advisory Detachment, Sea Commando team, from Đà Nẵng. He was assigned to assist Norris in bringing three downed U.S. air men from more than behind enemy lines. OV-10 pilot Clark was closest to the team's position and would be rescued first. Clark was relayed instructions to get in the water and float downstream where Norris and his team would intercept him. Anderson ordered Norris to take his team no more than forward and wait for the survivors to come to them, but Norris defied the order, turned off his radio and avoiding numerous enemy patrols, went twice that distance. Anderson, Norris, and Kiệt, along with four other Vietnamese commandos set up an overwatch position near the Miêu Giang River, which ran near the positions of both downed airmen. Clark was seriously weakened by five days hiding from the enemy with little to eat. On the night of 9 April, Norris, Kiệt and the commandos retrieved him from the river and got him to friendly territory. The next night they set out to find Hambleton. During their search that night two of the commandos refused to press the mission further, saying they \\"refused to follow an American just to rescue an American.\\" As dawn approached, Norris was going to proceed alone when Kiệt volunteered to stay with him. They took an abandoned sampan and cautiously searched the river shore for two more hours without success. They reluctantly returned to their forward operating base to rest and hope they would be more successful the next night. Forward air controller Harold Icke on Bilk 11 fixed Hambleton's position during the day so Norris and Kiệt could find him that night. Lieutenant Thomas R. Norris and Petty Officer Third Class Nguyễn Văn Kiệt went behind enemy lines disguised as fishermen in a sampan to rescue Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton. Norris was awarded the Medal of Honor and Kiệt was recognized with the Navy Cross for their actions. On the night of 12 April, Norris and Kiệt found a deserted village and clothing which they used to disguise themselves as fishermen. They took advantage of the abandoned sampan to row quietly up the river. Even in the pitch dark and dense fog, they could see large numbers of North Vietnamese soldiers and tanks on the shoreline. Traveling upriver in the sampan, they broke out of the heavy fog and found themselves under the Cam Lộ bridge. They had passed Hambleton's position more than 30 minutes previously. Turning around, they finally found Hambleton sitting in a clump of bushes, alive but partly delirious. Sunrise was coming, and although Norris thought it best to wait until dark to return downriver, he needed to be evacuated immediately. Despite the risk, they hid Hambleton in the bottom of the sampan, covered him with bamboo, and started downriver. Their sampan was soon spotted by North Vietnamese troops, some of whom fired at them, but Norris and Kiệt could not afford to return fire. They traveled down river and Norris called in air support to eliminate the North Vietnamese shooting at them from the northern bank. They rescued Clark and Hambleton, but Walker was discovered and killed by the NVA before they could return to rescue him. A book written about Kiệt's heroism by William Charles Anderson was later adapted into a 1988 movie, Bat*21. In 1999, after the release of considerable classified information, a second book, The Rescue of Bat 21, was published by Darrel D. Whitcomb. Kiệt emigrated to the United States, and, as of 2008, resided in Washington State. Navy Cross citation Thomas Norris readily supported nomination of Kiệt for the Navy Cross, the highest award the United States Navy can give to a foreign national.

The George Griswold Frelinghuysen Arboretum (127 acres) is an arboretum located at 353 East Hanover Avenue, Morris Township, New Jersey. It is open daily without charge. It is also the headquarters of the Morris County Parks Commission. The arboretum features thematic collections of plant life, including ornamental grasses, spring-blooming shrubs and perennials, summer shrubs and cutbacks, fall fruit and foliage, shade trees, and a garden called the \\"promising plants garden\\" which has underused plants supplied by nurseries, growers, and breeders. In front of the large main house there is the Great Lawn, a large gently sloping manicured grassy expanse in the style of an English county manor landscape; it is the site of outdoor concerts in the warmer months. There are different nature and horse trails. There is a Braille Nature Trail in a small wooded hollow just off the Great Lawn which was designed for hands- on exploration. The Kathryn A. Porter \\"Branching Out!\\" Garden is worked on by children ages 5-13 during a spring after-school and summer program; the course of study includes cooking and crafts. Participants grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers to take home. The Patriots' Path is a network of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails and green open spaces, and links to other parks in New Jersey. __TOC__ Background The main house serves as headquarters for the Morris County Park Commission. Along the west side of the property, there's a fairly steep cliff, with horse trails, which drops down to this stream. The arboretum surrounds the Frelinghuysens' Colonial Revival mansion and its formal gardens, and features nature trails with labeled trees and shrubs. The arboretum was established on the site of Whippany Farm, owned by George Griswold Frelinghuysen (1851-1936), son of Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, and a New York City patent attorney and president of Ballantine Brewing Company from 1905 until his retirement, and Sara Ballantine (1858-1940) of Newark, New Jersey, granddaughter of the founder Peter Ballantine of the Ballantine Brewing Company. In 1920, Mrs. Sara Ballantine planted roses, and the rose beds were laid out between the spokes of a Chippendale style brick wall set in a basket weave pattern. In 1964 their daughter, Matilda Frelinghuysen (1887-1969) began plans to turn the estate into an arboretum. Today's Frelinghuysen Arboretum was dedicated in 1971.

File:Frelinghuysen Arboretum Morristown Tree.jpgThe preserve has a wide variety of trees, plants, and gardens. Young trees are sometimes enclosed with wire fences to prevent deer from eating the leaves. File:Frelinghuysen Arboretum Morristown Front Lawn.jpgThe picturesque 127-acre estate was bequeathed to Morris County by Matilda E. Frelinghuysen, who inherited the estate from her parents, in 1969. She participated in plans to convert the property into an arboretum open to the public.

He was a pioneer in the field of nephrology, the branch of internal medicine that deals with diseases of the kidney. Addis described the pathogenesis of haemophilia in 1911 and was the first to demonstrate that normal plasma could correct the defect in haemophilia. Biography Addis was the son of Thomas Chalmers Addis, a clerk at the local branch of the Inland Revenue Service, and Cornelia Beers-Campbell, who married in Hoboken, New York, in 1880, but he was born in Edinburgh. Significant influences in his childhood were his grandfather, the Rev Dr Thomas Addis DD, Minister at Morningside Free Kirk, and his grandfather's assistant, the Very Rev Dr Alexander Martin (who came to lead the movement within the Free Kirk for reunification with the Established Church of Scotland). Addis studied medicine in his native Edinburgh, at the Institute of Pathology of Berlin Charité, and in Heidelberg. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with an MB in 1905 and an MD in 1908. In 1911, he took up a professorship at Stanford University, where he remained until his death in 1949. Addis married Elesa Bolton Partridge in 1913. They had two daughters, Elesa and Jean. By way of his daughter Jean, Addis is the great-grandfather of Gavin Newsom, the current governor of California.Guthrie, Julian (December 7, 2003) \\"Gonzalez, Newsom: What makes them run.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. Besides his studies in haemophilia, Addis made many contributions to the understanding of bile pigment metabolism. His investigations into kidney function led to the birth of modern renal physiology. Addis developed a means of measuring the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, epithelial cells, casts, and the protein content in urine specimens, a test used in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease. Towards the end of his life Addis began to study laboratory rats as a model of proteinuria, and was among the first people to note the presence of rodent major urinary proteins. Writing in Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Roland Schmitt et al. assessed Addis's contribution to medical science this way: \\"Since the times of Thomas Addis and other pioneers, no physical examination is said to be complete without the doctor looking at the patient's urine, grossly and under the microscope.\\"Schmitt, Ronald et al. () \\"Apricot urine in autumn.\\" Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Vol 19 No. 8. pp. 2147-2148. At the end of his career, Stanford University took away Addis's laboratory, perhaps on account of his leftist political views. He supported the loyalists in the Spanish Revolution, and was chairman of the San Francisco chapter of the Spanish Refugee Appeal, an organization that aided refugees from Franco's Spain. Addis toured the Soviet Union in 1935 and came away impressed by the communist country's medical accomplishments. He was friends with Harry Bridges and other leftwingers. Addis was chairman of the San Francisco chapter of Physician's Forum, an organization that supported national health insurance. Shortly before his death, he was expelled from the American Medical Association for refusing to pay his annual membership fee, which he did to protest the AMA's lack of support for President Truman's national health insurance plan. His Stanford colleague Frank W. Weymouth wrote about him: > Injustice or oppression in the next street ... or any spot inhabited by men > was a personal affront to Thomas Addis and his name, from its early > alphabetical place, was conspicuous on lists of sponsors of scores of > organizations fighting for democracy and against fascism. He worked on more > committees than could reasonably have been expected of so busy a man. ... > Tom Addis was happy to have a hand in bringing to the organization of > society some of the logic of science and to further that understanding and > to promote that democracy which are the only enduring foundations of human > dignity.Lemley, Kevin V. and Linus Pauling (1994) Thomas Addis: 1881-1949. > Biographical Memoirs, National Academy of Sciences.

They are most commonly non-recourse loans, which are secured by the project assets and paid entirely from project cash flow, rather than from the general assets or creditworthiness of the project sponsors, a decision in part supported by financial modeling;See generally, Scott Hoffman, The Law & Business of International Project Finance (3rd 2007, Cambridge Univ. Press). see Project finance model. The financing is typically secured by all of the project assets, including the revenue-producing contracts. Project lenders are given a lien on all of these assets and are able to assume control of a project if the project company has difficulties complying with the loan terms. Generally, a special purpose entity is created for each project, thereby shielding other assets owned by a project sponsor from the detrimental effects of a project failure. As a special purpose entity, the project company has no assets other than the project. Capital contribution commitments by the owners of the project company are sometimes necessary to ensure that the project is financially sound or to assure the lenders of the sponsors' commitment. Project finance is often more complicated than alternative financing methods. Traditionally, project financing has been most commonly used in the extractive (mining), transportation, telecommunications, and power industries, as well as for sports and entertainment venues. Risk identification and allocation is a key component of project finance. A project may be subject to a number of technical, environmental, economic and political risks, particularly in developing countries and emerging markets. Financial institutions and project sponsors may conclude that the risks inherent in project development and operation are unacceptable (unfinanceable). \\"Several long-term contracts such as construction, supply, off-take and concession agreements, along with a variety of joint-ownership structures are used to align incentives and deter opportunistic behaviour by any party involved in the project.\\"Marco Sorge, The nature of credit risk in project finance, BIS Quarterly Review, December 2004, p. 91. The patterns of implementation are sometimes referred to as \\"project delivery methods.\\" The financing of these projects must be distributed among multiple parties, so as to distribute the risk associated with the project while simultaneously ensuring profits for each party involved. In designing such risk-allocation mechanisms, it is more difficult to address the risks of developing countries' infrastructure markets as their markets involve higher risks.Koh, Jae Myong (2018) Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects, Palgrave Macmillan, pp.109-130. A riskier or more expensive project may require limited recourse financing secured by a surety from sponsors. A complex project finance structure may incorporate corporate finance, securitization, options (derivatives), insurance provisions or other types of collateral enhancement to mitigate unallocated risk. Origin Limited recourse lending was used to finance maritime voyages in ancient Greece and Rome. Its use in infrastructure projects dates to the development of the Panama Canal, and was widespread in the US oil and gas industry during the early 20th century. However, project finance for high-risk infrastructure schemes originated with the development of the North Sea oil fields in the 1970s and 1980s. Such projects were previously accomplished through utility or government bond issuances, or other traditional corporate finance structures. Project financing in the developing world peaked around the time of the Asian financial crisis, but the subsequent downturn in industrializing countries was offset by growth in the OECD countries, causing worldwide project financing to peak around 2000. The need for project financing remains high throughout the world as more countries require increasing supplies of public utilities and infrastructure. In recent years, project finance schemes have become increasingly common in the Middle East, some incorporating Islamic finance. The new project finance structures emerged primarily in response to the opportunity presented by long term power purchase contracts available from utilities and government entities. These long term revenue streams were required by rules implementing PURPA. The Policy resulted in further deregulation of electric generation and, significantly, international privatization following amendments to the Public Utilities Holding Company Act in 1994. The structure has evolved and forms the basis for energy and other projects throughout the world. Parties to a project financing There are several parties in a project financing depending on the type and the scale of a project. The most usual parties to a project financing are; # Sponsor (typically also an Equity Investor) # Lenders (including senior lenders and/or mezzanine) # Off-taker(s) # Contractor and equipment supplier # Operator # Financial Advisors # Technical Advisors # Legal Advisors # Equity Investors # Regulatory Agencies # Multilateral Agencies / Export Credit Agencies # Insurance Providers # Hedge providers  Project development  Project development is the process of preparing a new project for commercial operations. The process can be divided into three distinct phases: * Pre-bid stage * Contract negotiation stage * Money-raising stage  Financial model  A financial model is constructed by the sponsor as a tool to conduct negotiations with the investor and prepare a project appraisal report. It is usually a spreadsheet designed to process a comprehensive list of input assumptions, and to provide outputs that reflect the anticipated \\"real life\\" interaction between data and calculated values for a particular project. Properly designed, the financial model is capable of sensitivity analysis, i.e. calculating new outputs based on a range of data variations.  Contractual framework  The typical project finance documentation can be reconducted to four main types: * Shareholder/sponsor documents * Project documents * Finance documents * Security documents * Other project documents *Director/promotor Contribution  Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract  The most common project finance construction contract is the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract. An EPC contract generally provides for the obligation of the contractor to build and deliver the project facilities on a fixed price, turnkey basis, i.e., at a certain pre-determined fixed price, by a certain date, in accordance with certain specifications, and with certain performance warranties. The EPC contract is quite complicated in terms of legal issue, therefore the project company and the EPC contractor need sufficient experience and knowledge of the nature of project to avoid their faults and minimize the risks during contract execution. The terms EPC contract and turnkey contract are interchangeable. EPC stands for engineering (design), procurement and construction. Turnkey is based on the idea that when the owner takes responsibility for the facility all it will need to do is turn the key and the facility will function as intended. Alternative forms of construction contract are a project management approach and alliance contracting. Basic contents of an EPC contract are: * Description of the project * Price * Payment (typically by milestones) * Completion date * Completion guarantee and Liquidated Damages (LDs): * Performance guarantee and LDs * Cap under LDs  Operation and maintenance agreement  An operation and maintenance (O&M;) agreement is an agreement between the project company and the operator. The project company delegates the operation, maintenance and often performance management of the project to a reputable operator with expertise in the industry under the terms of the O&M; agreement. The operator could be one of the sponsors of the project company or third-party operator. In other cases the project company may carry out by itself the operation and maintenance of the project and may eventually arrange for the technical assistance of an experienced company under a technical assistance agreement. Basic contents of an O&M; contract are: * Definition of the service * Operator responsibility * Provision regarding the services rendered * Liquidated damages * Fee provisions  Concession deed An agreement between the project company and a public-sector entity (the contracting authority) is called a concession deed. The concession agreement concedes the use of a government asset (such as a plot of land or river crossing) to the project company for a specified period. A concession deed would be found in most projects which involve government such as in infrastructure projects. The concession agreement may be signed by a national/regional government, a municipality, or a special purpose entity set up by the state to grant the concession. Examples of concession agreements include contracts for the following: * A toll-road or tunnel for which the concession agreement giving a right to collect tolls/fares from the public or where payments are made by the contracting authority based on usage by the public. * A transportation system (e.g., a railway / metro) for which the public pays fares to a private company) * Utility projects where payments are made by a municipality or by end-users. * Ports and airports where payments are usually made by airlines or shipping companies. * Other public sector projects such as schools, hospitals, government buildings, where payments are made by the contracting authority.  Shareholders Agreement  The shareholders agreement (SHA) is an agreement between the project sponsors to form a special purpose company (SPC) in relation to the project development. This is the most basic of structures held by the sponsors in a project finance transaction. This is an agreement between the sponsors and deals with: * Injection of share capital * Voting requirements * Resolution of force one * Dividend policy * Management of the SPC * Disposal and pre-emption rights  Off-take agreement An off-take agreement is an agreement between the project company and the offtaker (the party who is buying the product / service that the project produces / delivers). In a project financing the revenue is often contracted (rather than being sold on a merchant basis). The off-take agreement governs mechanism of price and volume which make up revenue. The intention of this agreement is to provide the project company with stable and sufficient revenue to pay its project debt obligation, cover the operating costs and provide certain required return to the sponsors. The main off-take agreements are: * Take-or-pay contract: under this contract the off-taker – on an agreed price basis – is obligated to pay for product on a regular basis whether or not the off-taker actually takes the product. * Power purchase agreement: commonly used in power projects in emerging markets. The purchasing entity is usually a government entity. * Take-and-pay contract: the off-taker only pays for the product taken on an agreed price basis. * Long- term sales contract: the off-taker agrees to take agreed-upon quantities of the product from the project. The price is however paid based on market prices at the time of purchase or an agreed market index, subject to certain floor (minimum) price. Commonly used in mining, oil and gas, and petrochemical projects where the project company wants to ensure that its product can easily be sold in international markets, but off-takers not willing to take the price risk * Hedging contract: found in the commodity markets such as in an oilfield project. * Contract for Differences: the project company sells its product into the market and not to the off-taker or hedging counterpart. If however the market price is below an agreed level, the offtaker pays the difference to the project company, and vice versa if it is above an agreed level. * Throughput contract: a user of the pipeline agrees to use it to carry not less than a certain volume of product and to pay a minimum price for this.  Supply agreement A supply agreement is between the project company and the supplier of the required feedstock / fuel. If a project company has an off- take contract, the supply contract is usually structured to match the general terms of the off-take contract such as the length of the contract, force majeure provisions, etc. The volume of input supplies required by the project company is usually linked to the project’s output. Example under a PPA the power purchaser who does not require power can ask the project to shut down the power plant and continue to pay the capacity payment – in such case the project company needs to ensure its obligations to buy fuel can be reduced in parallel. The degree of commitment by the supplier can vary. The main supply agreements are: 1\\\\. Fixed or variable supply: the supplier agrees to provide a fixed quantity of supplies to the project company on an agreed schedule, or a variable supply between an agreed maximum and minimum. The supply may be under a take-or-pay or take-and-pay. 2.Output / reserve dedication: the supplier dedicates the entire output from a specific source, e.g., a coal mine, its own plant. However the supplier may have no obligation to produce any output unless agreed otherwise. The supply can also be under a take-or-pay or take- and-pay 3.Interruptible supply: some supplies such as gas are offered on a lower-cost interruptible basis – often via a pipeline also supplying other users. 4.Tolling contract: the supplier has no commitment to supply at all, and may choose not to do so if the supplies can be used more profitably elsewhere. However the availability charge must be paid to the project company.  Loan agreement A loan agreement is made between the project company (borrower) and the lenders. Loan agreement governs relationship between the lenders and the borrowers. It determines the basis on which the loan can be drawn and repaid, and contains the usual provisions found in a corporate loan agreement. It also contains the additional clauses to cover specific requirements of the project and project documents. Basic terms of a loan agreement include the following provisions. * General conditions precedent * Conditions precedent to each drawdown * Availability period, during which the borrower is obliged to pay a commitment fee * Drawdown mechanics * An interest clause, charged at a margin over base rate * A repayment clause * Financial covenants - calculation of key project metrics / ratios and covenants * Dividend restrictions * Representations and warranties * The illegality clause  Intercreditor agreement Intercreditor agreement is agreed between the main creditors of the project company. This is the agreement between the main creditors in connection with the project financing. The main creditors often enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the common terms and relationships among the lenders in respect of the borrower’s obligations. Intercreditor agreement will specify provisions including the following. * Common terms * Order of drawdown * Cashflow waterfall * Limitation on ability of creditors to vary their rights * Voting rights * Notification of defaults * Order of applying the proceeds of debt recovery * If there is a mezzanine funding component, the terms of subordination and other principles to apply as between the senior debt providers and the mezzanine debt providers.  Tripartite deed The financiers will usually require that a direct relationship between itself and the counterparty to that contract be established which is achieved through the use of a tripartite deed (sometimes called a consent deed, direct agreement or side agreement). The tripartite deed sets out the circumstances in which the financiers may “step in” under the project contracts in order to remedy any default. A tripartite deed would normally contain the following provision. * Acknowledgement of security: confirmation by the contractor or relevant party that it consents to the financier taking security over the relevant project contracts. * Notice of default: obligation on the relevant project counterparty to notify the lenders directly of defaults by the project company under the relevant contract. * Step-in rights and extended periods: to ensure that the lenders will have sufficient notice /period to enable it to remedy any breach by the borrower. * Receivership: acknowledgement by the relevant party regarding the appointment of a receiver by the lenders under the relevant contract and that the receiver may continue the borrower’s performance under the contract * Sale of asset: terms and conditions upon which the lenders may transfer the borrower’s entitlements under the relevant contract. Tripartite deed can give rise to difficult issues for negotiation but is a critical document in project financing.  Common Terms Agreement An agreement between the financing parties and the project company which sets out the terms that are common to all the financing instruments and the relationship between them (including definitions, conditions, order of drawdowns, project accounts, voting powers for waivers and amendments). A common terms agreement greatly clarifies and simplifies the multi-sourcing of finance for a project and ensures that the parties have a common understanding of key definitions and critical events. Terms Sheet Agreement between the borrower and the lender for the cost, provision and repayment of debt. The term sheet outlines the key terms and conditions of the financing. The term sheet provides the basis for the lead arrangers to complete the credit approval to underwrite the debt, usually by signing the agreed term sheet. Generally the final term sheet is attached to the mandate letter and is used by the lead arrangers to syndicate the debt. The commitment by the lenders is usually subject to further detailed due diligence and negotiation of project agreements and finance documents including the security documents. The next phase in the financing is the negotiation of finance documents and the term sheet will eventually be replaced by the definitive finance documents when the project reaches financial close.  Basic scheme  Hypothetical project finance scheme For example, the Acme Coal Co. imports coal. Energen Inc. supplies energy to consumers. The two companies agree to build a power plant to accomplish their respective goals. Typically, the first step would be to sign a memorandum of understanding to set out the intentions of the two parties. This would be followed by an agreement to form a joint venture. Acme Coal and Energen form an SPC (Special Purpose Corporation) called Power Holdings Inc. and divide the shares between them according to their contributions. Acme Coal, being more established, contributes more capital and takes 70% of the shares. Energen is a smaller company and takes the remaining 30%. The new company has no assets. Power Holdings then signs a construction contract with Acme Construction to build a power plant. Acme Construction is an affiliate of Acme Coal and the only company with the know-how to construct a power plant in accordance with Acme's delivery specification. A power plant can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. To pay Acme Construction, Power Holdings receives financing from a development bank and a commercial bank. These banks provide a guarantee to Acme Construction's financier that the company can pay for the completion of construction. Payment for construction is generally paid as such: 10% up front, 10% midway through construction, 10% shortly before completion, and 70% upon transfer of title to Power Holdings, which becomes the owner of the power plant. Acme Coal and Energen form Power Manage Inc., another SPC, to manage the facility. The ultimate purpose of the two SPCs (Power Holding and Power Manage) is primarily to protect Acme Coal and Energen. If a disaster happens at the plant, prospective plaintiffs cannot sue Acme Coal or Energen and target their assets because neither company owns or operates the plant. However project financiers may recognize this and require some sort of parent guarantee for up to negotiated amounts of operational liabilities. A Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) between Power Manage and Acme Coal supplies raw materials to the power plant. Electricity is then delivered to Energen using a wholesale delivery contract. The net cash flow of the SPC Power Holdings (sales proceeds less costs) will be used to repay the financiers. Complicating factors The above is a simple explanation which does not cover the mining, shipping, and delivery contracts involved in importing the coal (which in itself could be more complex than the financing scheme), nor the contracts for delivering the power to consumers. In developing countries, it is not unusual for one or more government entities to be the primary consumers of the project, undertaking the \\"last mile distribution\\" to the consuming population. The relevant purchase agreements between the government agencies and the project may contain clauses guaranteeing a minimum offtake and thereby guarantee a certain level of revenues. In other sectors including road transportation, the government may toll the roads and collect the revenues, while providing a guaranteed annual sum (along with clearly specified upside and downside conditions) to the project. This serves to minimise or eliminate the risks associated with traffic demand for the project investors and the lenders. Minority owners of a project may wish to use \\"off- balance-sheet\\" financing, in which they disclose their participation in the project as an investment, and excludes the debt from financial statements by disclosing it as a footnote related to the investment. In the United States, this eligibility is determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Many projects in developing countries must also be covered with war risk insurance, which covers acts of hostile attack, derelict mines and torpedoes, and civil unrest which are not generally included in \\"standard\\" insurance policies. Today, some altered policies that include terrorism are called Terrorism Insurance or Political Risk Insurance. In many cases, an outside insurer will issue a performance bond to guarantee timely completion of the project by the contractor. Publicly funded projects may also use additional financing methods such as tax increment financing or private finance initiative (PFI). Such projects are often governed by a capital improvement plan which adds certain auditing capabilities and restrictions to the process. Project financing in transitional and emerging market countries are particularly risky because of cross-border issues such as political, currency and legal system risks. Therefore, mostly requires active facilitation by the government. Step-in rights Step-in rights allow the client or a nominated third party the right to step-in and intervene, in particular to directly operate the outsourced services or to appoint a new operator. Circumstances where step-in rights may be contractually invoked may include supplier insolvency, a force majeure event which prevents or impedes the outsourced service provision, where the client believes that there is a substantial risk to the provision of the services, or where performance fails to meet a defined critical level of service.Stabler, J., Step-in Rights - It's the Plan, not the Provision, that Really Counts, published 25 March 2009, accessed 11 May 2009, formerly at http://alsbridge.eu/knowledge/articles.html?id=161, no longer available on-line Suitable clauses in a contract may provide for the outsourced service provider to pay any additional costs which are faced by the client and specify that the provider's obligation to provide the services is annulled or suspended.Willis, A., and MacFarlane, A., Termination and Step In Rights, DLA Piper, accessed 26 April 2020 If both sides have a contract clause permitting Step-in rights, then there is a right, though not an obligation, to take over a task that is not going well, or even the entire project. When and How are important: \\"What is the process for stepping-in\\" must be clearly defined in the collateral warranty.

A proponent of reproductive justice, Avery has worked to develop healthcare services and education that address black women's mental and physical health stressors. She is best known as the founder of the National Black Women's Health Project, the first national organization to specialize in Black women's reproductive health issues. For her work with the NBWHP, she has received the MacArthur Foundation's Fellowship for Social Contribution and the Gustav O. Lienhard Award for the Advancement of Health Care from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, among other awards.  Family and education  Avery was born in Waynesville, Georgia and grew up on a farm in DeLand, Florida. She is the daughter of L. Alyce M. Ingram, a schoolteacher. Her mother graduated of Bethune-Cookman College. Her father, Quitman Reddick, owned a neighborhood store. He was killed when Avery was 14 years old. The oldest of three children, Avery assumed a lot of responsibility from a young age.Loretta Ross, \\"Smith Voices of Feminism Oral History Project Interview with Byllye Avery\\". Accessed on March 25, 2018 Avery attended college at Talladega College and earned her BA in psychology in 1959. She met her husband, Wesley Avery, while at Talladega College and they married in 1960. In 1967, Avery received a fellowship to obtain her master's in special education at the University of Florida Gainesville. Upon earning her M.Ed. in 1969, she became a special education teacher. In 1970, only a few months after starting her new position, her husband suffered a fatal heart attack. He was only thirty-three years old and it was discovered after his death that he had very high blood pressure. At the time she was also pregnant with their third child. The death of her husband helped catalyze Avery's commitment to improving health care and health education in the Black community. Avery met her wife, Ngina Lythcott, in 1989, and the two were married in 2005. Lythcott is a public health practitioner and activist.  Activism  In the early 1970s Avery began participating in consciousness-raising groups and legal abortion referral services. In response to the lack of access to abortion and other reproductive health needs that low-income Black women faced in her community, Avery and her colleagues Joan Edelson, Judy Levy, and Margaret Parrish opened the Gainesville Women's Health Center (GWHC) in 1974. It was the first abortion and gynecological care clinic in the city. They opened these facilities after a petition to open a Planned Parenthood clinic in Gainesville was denied. The GWHC mission statement was to \\"help women solve the crisis-producing situation of unplanned, unwanted pregnancy,\\" at a low cost.University of Florida Digital Collections. Accessed on April 1, 2018. The clinic provided abortions and contraceptive services, facilitated sexuality workshops, and provided other women's health-related training and services tailored to Black women, such as sickle cell anemia testing. To help educate women on best health services, the staff created a monthly newsletter called Sage-Femme. In 1978, Avery helped to found Birthplace, an alternative birthing center in Gainesville. Certified nurse-midwifes assisted women with deliveries and Avery personally assisted in the birth of one hundred patients before her departure. In 1981, while serving on the board of directors for National Women's Health Network, Avery started a two-year long project called the Black Women's Health Project. As part of this project, Avery planned The Conference of Black Women's Health Issues which was held at Spelman College in June 1983. Two thousand women attended the three-day event. Topics included domestic violence, diabetes, sexual abuse, obesity, sexuality, childbirth, mental health as well as holistic wellness. It encouraged attendees to take charge of their health through consciousness-raising, community organizing around health issues, and self-examination. Following the conference, Avery founded National Black Women's Health Project, now known as the Black Women's Health Imperative, officially in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia. It is the only national organization exclusively dedicated to improving health and wellness among Black women. NBWHP opened an advocacy and policy office in Washington, D.C. in 1991. By 1991, the NBWHP had chapters in twenty-five states and had expanded its reach to work with women in Belize, Jamaica, South Africa, Nigeria, and Brazil. Recalling the negative attitudes she was taught about sex as a child, Avery taught her daughters to celebrate their bodies and menstruation. When her first daughter turned eleven, Avery gave her a cake that read \\"Happy Birthday, Happy Menstruation!\\" Soon after, she gave a workshop on menstruation and childbearing at her daughter's elementary school that she developed into a film On Becoming a Woman: Mothers and Daughters Talking to Each OtherOn Becoming a Woman: Mothers and Daughters Talking to Each Other (1987), the first documentary film by African-American women sharing their perspectives on menstruation, sex, and love.http://www.worldcat.org/title/on-becoming-a-woman- mothers-daughters-talking-together-a-film/oclc/30694664 Accessed March 20, 2018. Along with prominent African-American leaders such as Shirley Chisholm, Maxine Waters, Dorothy Height, and Faye Wattleton, issued and signed a public statement, \\"We Remember: African American Women for Reproductive Freedom,” in 1989. The statement supports reproductive freedom (including the right to have children, the right to access to contraceptive services and reproductive health information, and the right to health care as well as safe and legal abortions.) The statement connected racism, poverty, and violence to negative reproductive health outcomes for African American women. The statement was reprinted repeatedly and eventually circulated over 250,000 copies. The statement can still be found in many anthologies on women's rights and activism. Avery was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship this same year in the area of health policy. In 1990, Avery, along with fifteen other African-American women and men, formed the African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom. The organization was created to end the stigma against abortions in the Black community and to make abortions more accessible for Black women. Avery has written and lectured widely on how race, class and sex impact women's healthcare. She has called the health discrepancies between African-American and white women a \\"conspiracy of silence\\". She has been a visiting fellow at the Harvard University School of Public Health; she has served on the Charter Advisory Committee for the Office of Research on Women's Health of the National Institutes of Health; she has been a health issues advisor for the Kellogg Foundation's International Leadership Program; and she has served as a consultant on women's healthcare in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.\\"Neva, Goodwin.

Although its southern terminus is at Route 28, some signage indicates that Route 38 continues south towards Sullivan Square in Boston. History 60pxThe majority of Route 38 was originally designated as Route 6B in the New England road marking system, an alternate to New England Interstate Route 6. It began at Route 6 somewhere in Cambridge and made its way to present Route 38 in Somerville, running north on much the same alignment as is followed now, with the only real differences in Medford (where it used High Street (Route 60) rather than the Mystic Valley Parkway) and in Winchester center (where it ran via the rotary). In Lowell, Route 6B turned west on current Route 110, ending at the corner of Appleton Street and Gorham Street. (Route 6 came from the south on Gorham and turned west on Appleton; Route 6B came from the east on Appleton.) 60pxIn 1927, Route 6 became U.S. Route 3 north of Boston, and Route 6B became Route 3B. By 1928 the alignment in Cambridge was finalized. It began at the north end of the Boston University Bridge, which carried US 3 across the Charles River, and ran east on present Memorial Drive and Land Boulevard before turning north on the Northern Artery (present Route 28) to reach present Route 38 at Mystic Avenue. The whole alignment south of Mystic Avenue was shared with U.S. Route 1 and Route 28. Between 1929 and 1933, Route 3B was renumbered Route 38. Between 1945 and 1950, it was extended north from Lowell to cross the Merrimack River on Gorham Street, then its present alignment to the newly formed New Hampshire Route 38. The present alignment in Lowell was adopted in or after 1954, when the new bridge across the Merrimack River was built. By 1937, the concurrency with Route 60 in Medford was removed, and Route 38 was moved to use South Street between Main Street and Winthrop Street. Later it was shifted north to the Mystic Valley Parkway (Route 16) due to South Street becoming one-way eastbound. In the early 1970s, many routes in the Boston area were renumbered or realigned. Route 38 was simply cut back to its split with Route 28, as it was concurrent with other routes the rest of the way to its southern end, and it was no longer tied to U.S. Route 3. At some point in the 1990s, directional signs were installed showing Route 38 continuing southeast from Route 28 towards Sullivan Square. By 1989, Route 38 was moved to a short bypass around the rotary in Winchester center. Prior to that, it was coextant with Main Street all the way from the Medford-Winchester line to the Tewksbury-Lowell line. Even north of the Tewksbury-Lowell line, Main Street continues as Rogers Street for exactly one mile before Route 38 splits onto Nesmith Street towards Route 110; Main Street finally ends under the mentioned Rogers Street name around 3000 feet after that split at Lawrence Street in downtown Lowell.

Theudoald was the legitimate but later claimed illegitimate son of Grimoald II (son of Pepin II of Herstal and Plectrude) and Theudesinda of Frisia (daughter of king Radbod). Thus, he was a grandson of the Frisian king. His grandmother Plectrude tried to have him recognised by his grandfather as the legitimate heir to all the Pippinid lands, instead of Charles Martel. His grandmother surrendered on his behalf in 716 to Chilperic II of Neustria and Ragenfrid. Theudoald died, probably killed, around 741, after the death of his uncle and protector, Charles Martel. It is notable that, despite his having been proclaimed heir to Pepin of Herstal, when Charles Martel seized power, he allowed his nephew to live, instead of killing him, as was often the case in the Middle Ages.

Ave Maria University shares its history with the former Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which was founded in 1998 and closed in 2007. The school was founded by Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza. In 2016, the enrollment was 1,100, 80% of whom were Catholic.  History = Ave Maria College  Ave Maria College was founded by Catholic philanthropist and former Domino's Pizza owner and founder Tom Monaghan on March 19, 1998, occupying two former elementary school buildings in Ypsilanti, Michigan near the campus of Eastern Michigan University. Monaghan's goal was to create a Roman Catholic university faithful to the magisterium of the Catholic Church, providing a liberal arts education in a Catholic environment. He originally intended to construct a full college campus on his property in nearby Ann Arbor, known as Domino's Farms. The plan for the Ann Arbor campus also included a 25-story crucifix, a size about half the height of the Washington Monument. Interim Naples campus After being denied zoning approval by Ann Arbor Township to build a larger campus near Domino's Farms, Monaghan decided to move the college to Florida. Monaghan initiated the founding of the Florida institution Ave Maria University with a donation of $250 million. In August 2003, the University opened an interim campus in The Vineyards in Naples, Florida, enrolling some 100 undergraduate students, 75 of whom were freshmen. While occupying the interim campus, Monahgan focused efforts on constructing a new campus and planned community nearby known as Ave Maria, Florida. The Barron Collier family donated the land in southwest Florida for the campus, joining Monaghan in the enterprise as 50% partner. While the infrastructure of the new campus and town were being completed in early 2007, the Ypsilanti campus was also closing at the end of the 2006–2007 academic year. Monaghan planned to have most of the staff transferred to the Florida location. The Michigan location remained open until students graduated or transferred, leaving just three students for the final year and a number of the remaining staff. Ave Maria campus The university moved from the temporary facility to the new campus in 2007. In its first year at the new campus the university enrolled about 450 undergraduates and 150 graduate students. Bishop Frank Dewane, the local Catholic ordinary, formally dedicated the university in 2008.\\"Bishop dedicates Ave Maria University Oratory\\", Catholic Online, 2008-Apr-05. Accessed April 23, 2008 In March 2007, the original provost of the university, Fr. Joseph Fessio, S.J., was dismissed by Monaghan for undisclosed reasons. In a formal statement, Monaghan, in his role as chancellor, stated that the dismissal was because of \\"irreconcilable differences over administrative policies and practices.\\" Immediately, the school's first-ever student protests were mounted in support of Fessio. Outside observers were critical: editor Philip F. Lawler of the conservative Catholic World News said the firing was \\"institutional suicide\\", and that if a respected theologian such as Fessio could be fired then no others would want to fill the position. Monaghan reinstated Fessio the next day as theologian- in-residence. He was dismissed from that position in 2009, stating he was fired because of a conversation he had with Academic Vice President Jack Sites about administrative policies harming the university's finances.Fr. Joseph Fessio, \\"Breaking: Fr. Joseph Fessio, S.J., dismissed from Ave Maria University\\", Ignatius Insight Scoop, 2009 He said his firing was \\"another mistake in a long series of unwise decisions\\" but that he would continue to guide students to AMU. The provost position remains vacant. Monaghan expects to continue expanding the university and hopes to one day have an enrollment over 5,000, Division I athletics and an academic reputation as \\"a Catholic Ivy,\\". In 2011, James Towey, former Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives and former President of Saint Vincent College, was named the president of Ave Maria University after a unanimous vote by the AMU Board of Trustees. He also assumed the role of CEO, in the place of Monaghan, who remains the Chancellor. The 2008 financial crisis took a toll on Ave Maria's finances. Monaghan said in 2012 that Ave Maria's construction cost estimates doubled over three years, requiring the university to cut back on planned buildings. The troubled Florida real estate market also meant that Ave Maria School of Law had to shelve its plans for a building in Ave Maria, as its existing campus was worth less than was paid for it. According to Towey, for a period of time the University survived through Monaghan's funding of a ten million dollar annual deficit. Towey credits his efforts at controlling financing costs, along with increased contributions, with placing the University back on a firm financial footing by 2014. In February 2012, Ave Maria made national news when it filed its lawsuit Ave Maria University v. Sebelius, suing the government over the US Health and Human Services mandate by claiming that it would force the university to forego its religious freedom. It became the second college to do so, and was followed by several others, including the Franciscan University of Steubenville and the University of Notre Dame. The lawsuit is represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.Presidential Statement, \\"Ave Maria University will continue to vigorously prosecute its lawsuit against the Federal government's attack on the University's religious liberty.\\" Found at http://www.avemaria.edu/Portals/0/Images/Kevins'%20Images/statement%20on%20student%20insurance%20-%20may%2021%202012.pdf In June 2012, President Towey wrote that the university would \\"vigorously prosecute its lawsuit\\". In 2016, the Supreme Court unanimously sent the case back to federal appeals court to find a solution that would both honor religious organizations objections and provide their employees with birth control. Ave Maria administrators celebrated the decision as a \\"great victory.\\" The university's growth has fallen short of its stated goal of \\"growing the University's undergraduate enrollment at its main campus in Florida to approximately 1,700 students by the fall of 2016\\" and 1,500 by the year 2020. The university ran a satellite campus in Nicaragua called the Ave Maria University-Latin American Campus for 13 years, and then sold it to Keiser University in July 2013. Founder's goals In a May 2004 speech, Monaghan expressed his wish to have the new town and university campus be free from pre-marital sex, contraceptives and pornography. This elicited sharply critical statements from the international press, who saw such proposed restrictions as violations of civil liberties. Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union branch in Florida, challenged the legality of the restriction of sales of contraceptives. He said, \\"This is not just about the sale of contraceptives in the local pharmacy, it is about whether in an incorporated town there will be a fusion of religion and government.\\" An opinion column in The Wall Street Journal quoted an Ave Maria faculty member who called it a \\"Catholic Jonestown\\". Frances Kissling of Catholics for Choice compared Monaghan's civic vision to Islamic fundamentalism, and called it \\"un-American\\". In response, Monaghan announced a milder form of civic planning in which the town could mostly grow on its own, except that it would not have sex shops or strip clubs, and store owners would be asked rather than ordered not to sell contraceptives or porn. Contraception and porn would still be banned from the university. Academics Ave Maria University currently offers 33 undergraduate and three graduate degrees. Graduate programs include M.A. and Ph.D. studies in Theology and a Master of Theological Studies for non-traditional students. Undergraduate students must complete a core curriculum of 14 required courses in philosophy, theology, composition, science, math, history, political science, and a foreign language. In 2012 U.S. News & World Report reported that the university had a student–teacher ratio of 12:1, with 696 undergraduate students paying an average of $19,440 in tuition and fees for the school year 2011–2012, with some also paying $8,350 for a dorm room and meals. The university's rating was in \\"Tier 2\\", below 178 other American colleges ranked in \\"Tier 1\\". In 2015, College Factual ranked Ave Maria University as a Top 10 college in the state of Florida. In December 2015, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools renewed Ave Maria University's accreditation.  Law school  Although they were both established by Monaghan, the Ave Maria School of Law and Ave Maria University are separate entities. The Ave Maria School of Law is controlled by a board that is independent of AMU. Ave Maria School of Law is a fully American Bar Association-accredited Catholic law school, located on a campus in Naples, Florida.American Bar Association Grants Full Accreditation to Ave Maria School of Law It has a current enrollment of 375 students and offers a Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. After receiving accreditation in 2005, the law school was moved by Monaghan from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to the north side of Naples, Florida. Many students chose not to continue their studies, and the school's high ranking with U.S. News & World Report dropped dramatically, down to the lowest ranked level (tier 4) from 2008 to 2011, then failing to achieve any ranking in 2012. In 2014, the law school regained its tier 4 position. Accreditation In June 2010, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) declared that Ave Maria had obtained \\"accredited membership\\" status. This allows the university to award bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees accredited by the SACS. The university had previously received full accreditation from the American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE) in June 2008. On October 7, 2011, the local ordinary, Bishop Frank Joseph Dewane, formally recognized the institution as a Catholic university pursuant to the code of canon law. In December 2015, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reaffirmed Ave Maria University's accreditation. Study abroad Ave Maria University offered study abroad programs in Gaming, Austria and in San Marcos, Nicaragua. Instruction was conducted in English. The Austrian program required an additional $1,750 beyond regular tuition, along with the added expense of airfare and ground transportation, while the Nicaraguan program required no additional tuition. The Nicaraguan program was closed in mid-2013. Campus 180px The new campus is located in the town of Ave Maria, Florida, east of Naples in rural Collier County. The town site occupies about , of which nearly 20 percent are designated for the campus. The Ave Maria Oratory, a large Gothic-inspired structure located at the center of town, was constructed by the university and currently serves as the parish church. Several more master- planned communities are under construction or planned in the immediately surrounding area, north and south of the campus. Managed wetlands lie north and west of the campus. Wildlife preservation and restoration projects have also been instituted on the site, to preserve a degree of its natural state. Recognition Ave Maria University won the 2007 'Digie Award' (Commercial Real Estate Digital Innovation Award). The $24 million Oratory won the 2008 TCA Achievement Award as well as an award from the American Institute of Steel Construction.  Mother Teresa Museum  Ave Maria University Mother Teresa Museum contains an array of items on loan from the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta, including a strand of Mother Teresa's hair, a wooden cross made from the door that she opened each morning, and a piece of the marble that fashioned her tomb. The Missionaries of Charity also provided storyboards – in Spanish and English – that include rare photographs of Mother Teresa and tell the story of her life.  Student life  Dormitories are organized into same- sex communities. There are six dorms on campus: Sebastian, Maria Goretti, St. Joseph, Xavier, and the Megadorm, a building which contains both John Paul II and Mother Teresa dormitories. Not all dormitories are used to house undergraduates; for example, Xavier has been used as a conference center and guest house. Opposite-sex visitors are permitted in residential common areas during the day, and in individual dorm rooms on specified evenings. Liturgy Interior of the parish church Mass is celebrated on-campus in the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel and off-campus in the Ave Maria Parish Church. The parish serves both the town and the university. Originally owned by the university and called the Oratory, the building was purchased in January 2017 by the Diocese of Venice, and its status was raised to parish church. Chapels are located in each of the six dorms, each containing a tabernacle housing the Eucharist, and each but the Megadorm containing an altar for Mass. Members of the clergy, who live on campus, assist in maintaining spiritual life. A perpetual adoration chapel was added to the Library in 2009.\\"The residence halls are equipped with...chapels.\\" from http://www.avemaria.edu/CampusLife/ResidenceHalls.aspx ; Library info from article http://www.aveherald.com/news/ave-maria-news/334-perpetual-adoration- chapel-opens-at-amu.html The mass if offered in both the Novus Ordo, as well as the Tridentine form.  Student organizations  The official news publication of Ave Maria's student body is The Gyrene Gazette. Campus organizations include the student activities board, student government, and more than 40 other clubs and organizations. The university also offers intramural and club sport programs. Athletics Ave Maria teams, nicknamed the Gyrenes, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division II level, primarily competing in the Sun Conference. In 2011, Ave Maria became the first college in southwestern Florida to field a football team. The women's lacrosse team competed in the National Women's Lacrosse league (NWLL) in their first varsity season in the spring of 2015.

She was born into the powerful House of Kosača, staunch supporters of the Bosnian Church. Her marriage in 1446 was arranged to bring peace between the King and her father, Stjepan Vukčić. The queenship of Catherine, who at that point converted to Roman Catholicism, was marked with an energetic construction of churches throughout the country. Following her husband's death in 1461, Catherine's role receded to that of queen dowager at the court of her stepson, King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia and put an end to the independent kingdom. Catherine's stepson was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received a pension from the papacy. From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children. Her efforts to negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity. Queen Catherine remains one of the most important figures in the folk tradition and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite there being no evidence that she was beatified, the Queen has long been venerated by Catholics in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is increasingly seen as an important transethnic state symbol.  Youth  Catherine was the daughter of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, one of the most powerful figures amongst Bosnian nobility, Grand Duke of Bosnia and the ruler of Zachlumia and Travunia. His domain later came to be known as Herzegovina, after the German title of herzog he adopted in relation to the Duchy of St. Sava. Catherine's mother was Jelena, daughter of Zeta's lord Balša III and the first of Stjepan's three wives. Catherine was the couple's first child but the precise date of her birth is not known; both 1424 and late August 1425 have been suggested by her biographers. It can be surmised that the place of her birth was either the Sokol Fortress, an old seat of the House of Kosača, or the feudal town of Blagaj, Stjepan's favourite residence. Kosača's domain in the 1440s Little is known about Catherine's premarital life. The earliest source that mentions her is the will of her maternal great-grandmother Jelena Lazarević, dated 25 November 1442, in which she left her her gold earrings and a snake-shaped bracelet. Stjepan was a member and significant supporter of the Bosnian Church, while her mother was an Eastern Orthodox Christian; Catherine was raised in her father's confession. Catherine comes into focus following the accession of Stephen Thomas to the Bosnian throne in 1443. Thomas, of illegitimate birth but designated as heir by Tvrtko II, belonged to the Bosnian Church and was married according to its customs. His wife, Vojača, was the mother of his son, Stephen Tomašević. Two years after his accession, King Thomas abandoned the Bosnian \\"heresy\\" and converted to Roman Catholicism. The Catholic Church did not recognize his union with Vojača as a valid marriage, and Pope Eugene IV gave him permission to repudiate her in early 1445. The civil war between the King and Catherine's father, which had been raging since the former's enthronement, ended soon afterwards. Peace was to be sealed with the marriage of King Thomas and Catherine, a great honour to her father. The project may have been envisioned as early as the beginning of 1445, when Thomas requested the annulment of his union with Vojača.  Marriage  The marriage ceremony was conducted according to the Catholic rite between 19 May, when Catherine arrived in Milodraž near Fojnica accompanied by her father, and 22 May 1446. The wedding was attended by a delegation from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), but it failed to end all internal strife, since leading noblemen such as Ivaniš Pavlović (Catherine's first cousin, lord of eastern Bosnia) and Petar Vojsalić (lord of Donji Kraji) snubbed it. The coronation, planned to take place in Mile near Visoko immediately after the wedding, was apparently postponed. The new queen consort converted to Catholicism (\\"laid aside Patarin errors\\"), likely prior to her marriage, and was allowed by Pope Eugene to choose for herself two chaplains from among Bosnian Franciscans. The Queen's father appears to have contemplated converting too, but eventually gave up the idea and remained an adherent of the Bosnian Church until his death. Catherine proved to be a zealous convert. She initiated and financed from her dowry the construction of churches throughout Bosnia, starting with one in Kupres in 1447, followed by churches in Krupa na Vrbasu and Jezero; a church in Jajce was built in 1458. In December 1458 she wrote to Pope Pius II to request that the church in Jajce, built along with a Franciscan monastery and a vicariate, be named after her namesake, Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Pius conceded her request in a bull issued on 13 December, granting absolution to anyone who visited Queen Catherine's church at Christmas or Easter, or on certain feast days. Another church built by Queen Catherine in Jajce and dedicated to Saint Catherine was a simple royal chapel. The churches built in Vrbanja, Vranduk, Tešanj and Vrila are attributed to both Catherine and her husband. The royal couple had at least two children together. In 1449, the King notified Ragusa of the birth of a son: this is likely to have been Sigismund. A daughter named Catherine was born in 1453. Queen Catherine may have also been the mother of a third son of King Thomas, who was buried on Meleda. Mavro Orbini, a 16th-century Ragusan chronicler, believed that the boy was born to Vojača. If Catherine hoped that her stepson's marriage to Maria of Serbia and his subsequent accession to the Serbian throne in 1459 would pave way for her own son's accession in Bosnia, the hopes were dashed very quickly: within three months Stephen Tomašević lost the Despotate of Serbia to the Ottomans and returned to the Bosnian royal court with his wife.  Widowhood  King Stephen Tomašević King Thomas died in the summer of 1461, leaving Catherine a 37-year-old widow with two minor children. Her stepson, Stephen Tomašević, ascended the throne as intended. Catherine's relations with him were poor during Thomas's lifetime; this now threatened to weaken the kingdom against its adversaries, most of all the rapidly expanding Ottoman Empire. Stephen Tomašević was thus determined to settle his differences with Catherine and guaranteed her the title and privileges of a queen dowager. Having assured himself of Stephen Tomašević's \\"affection\\" for his daughter, the Grand Duke refrained from disputing the succession and claiming the crown for his grandson by Catherine. He likely found it in his interest that the throne be occupied by an adult monarch, rather than a child, due to external threats. On 1 December, the Grand Duke wrote to Venetian officials that the new King had \\"taken her as his mother\\", Vojača having already died. Although popularly believed to have retired to the castle of Kozograd above Fojnica as dowager, there is no historical basis for dismissing the possibility that she remained at the royal court in Jajce as the mother of Stephen Tomašević's closest heirs. In 1462, Catherine's situation worsened. Her brother Vladislav revolted against their father and sought help from the Ottomans. The Grand Duke and the King started preparing defenses, but the latter made a fatal mistake by provoking the powerful enemy further and then relying on the help of Christendom. In the spring of 1463, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror and his army started marching towards Bosnia. Catherine, who is thought to have been on her way south to visit her feuding family, immediately hastened back home. By May, fortresses were rapidly falling to the Ottomans. The royal family appears to have decided to disperse from Jajce and flee towards Croatia and the coast in several directions to confuse and mislead the invaders. Catherine found herself besieged in Kozograd Castle, while her children were captured in the town of Zvečaj and taken to Mehmed's capital of Constantinople. Her stepson was deceived into surrendering in Ključ, from where he ordered all his castellans to surrender the fortresses, but Kozograd defied the King's order. Its defenders appear to have stalled the Ottomans while Catherine escaped. Vladislav was informed by the Ragusans on 23 May that they would send vessels for his sister if she succeeded in reaching the coast. Two days later, her stepson was executed on Mehmed's orders. The Queen rode to Konjic and from there probably towards Drijeva, before finally embarking on the promised vessels in Ston and sailing to Lopud, an island held by the Republic of Ragusa. The two queens, Catherine and Maria, were the only members of the royal family to escape the Ottomans.  Refuge in Dubrovnik  Catherine arrived on Lopud in the second half of June 1463. The Ragusan authorities, concerned that harbouring the Queen might provoke an Ottoman attack on their own state, refused her entry into Dubrovnik itself until 23 July, after her father and brothers launched a successful counter-attack against the Ottomans and pushed them away from the Ragusan borders. Her widowed stepdaughter-in-law, Queen Maria, was also denied access to the Ragusan islands until July. In Dubrovnik, Queen Catherine attempted to claim the tribute of Ston, paid annually to Bosnian rulers, but the authorities declined on 20 August. Moreover, they decided that the annual rent for the use of houses and land belonging to the Bosnian royal family should be kept in their own treasury until the legal heir could be established. On 26 October, Catherine entrusted Ragusa with Thomas's silver sword, stipulating that it should be handed over to Sigismund \\"should he ever be freed\\"; or else to nobody but the person she would name as heir. Soon afterwards she left Dubrovnik for Slano. A reason for Ragusa's reluctance to comply with Catherine's demands may have been the reconquest of parts of Bosnia by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Ragusa's overlord, who attempted to revive the Bosnian kingdom by installing puppet kings. The Kosačas liberated almost all of their land during the autumn of 1463, and even succeeded in occupying some of the former royal domain. Catherine likely headed towards her family's holdings, which were again under Ottoman attack in the summer of 1465. Catherine and Vladislav retreated to the peninsula of Pelješac until Ragusa granted them refuge on one of their islands. Catherine left Ragusa permanently in September 1465, but her subsequent whereabouts can only be conjectured. She likely lived in Zachlumia or in the area of Šibenik. The Grand Duke, her father, died in 1466.  Roman pension  Lajos Thallóczy believed this portrait, from the Capitoline Museums, depicted Catherine, but this was proven to be chronologically impossible. In 1467, Catherine sailed towards the Italian Peninsula, possibly at the suggestion of the Veronese humanist Leonardo Montagna, who dedicated two poems to her. She took her own vessel and disembarked in Ancona. By 29 October 1467, the Queen was in Rome, already receiving a very generous pension from the Papal State. Upon arrival, she rented a house for herself and her entourage, consisting of Bosnian nobility who had followed her. On 1 October 1469, she moved to the rione of Pigna, into a house near San Marco Evangelista al Campidoglio. Pope Sixtus IV gave her considerable property adjacent to the Tiber. The Queen was a prominent figure in Roman society. Her presence at the proxy wedding of Grand Prince Ivan III of Russia and the Byzantine princess Sophia Palaiologina in 1472 was widely noted, as was her pilgrimage to L'Aquila on the occasion of the translation of Bernardino of Siena's relics to a new church (the construction of which was funded, among others, by King Thomas). That she lived a comfortable life can be deduced from the impression she left on Roman chroniclers, who wrote about the entourage of 40 mounted knights accompanying her on a pilgrimage to St. Peter's Basilica to celebrate the new year 1475. Despite the honours and financial security she enjoyed, Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children. Intent on finding a proxy for negotiations with the Sublime Porte, as well as obtaining resources for their release, she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, on 23 July 1470. On 11 February 1474, she addressed a letter to the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations. Sforza obliged. In the summer of 1474, the Queen was in Novi, a city in her family's possession. She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko's wife, Margarita Marzano, and probably wanted Vlatko's help in establishing contact with their younger half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman. Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear, but in any case she failed to reunite with either of her children. They both followed in their uncle's footsteps, becoming Muslims and, in Sigismund's case, also attaining high-ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire.  Death and burial  The original digraphic epitaph on Catherine's tomb as recorded in 1545 Disappointed at the failure, Catherine returned to Rome and entered the Secular Franciscan Order, probably inspired by a monk at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. Shortly before her death, in 1478, Catherine was visited by Nicholas of Ilok, the puppet king of Hungarian-controlled parts of Bosnia. He proposed that she recognize him as legitimate king and attempted to win her favor for several days. Nicholas recorded that the ailing Queen became \\"so infuriated that she looked like a sharp sabre\\". On 20 October 1478, Catherine made her last will, recorded by a Dalmatian priest, in the presence of seven witnesses, six of whom were Franciscans of Ara Coeli. She expressed a wish to be buried before the main altar of Ara Coeli. Considering herself entitled to dispose of the Bosnian crown, she named Pope Sixtus IV and his successors guardians of the kingdom, obligating them to enthrone her son should he convert back to Christianity or else her daughter should she reconvert. Most of her personal belongings were inherited by her courtiers. Her chapel inventory was left to Saint Jerome's Church for the Slavic Nation, while the saint's relics were to be passed to Saint Mary's Church in Jajce. She decreed that, if her son never returned to the Christian faith, King Thomas's silver sword left in Dubrovnik for safekeeping should be handed to her nephew by Vladislav, Balša Hercegović. The Queen died five days after composing the will, which was immediately taken to the Pope along with her husband's sword and spurs. Catherine was buried according to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara Coeli during works on the interior of the church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.  Legacy  Catherine's tombstone on the wall of Ara Coeli Along with the 12th- century Ban Kulin, Queen Catherine is one of the two princely personages who entered Bosnian folk tradition. As such, she is traditionally referred to as \\"the last Queen of Bosnia\\" – erroneously, as her stepdaughter-in-law both replaced her as queen and outlived her. The cult of Queen Catherine, who was first mentioned as beatified in the Paris-published Martyrologium franciscanum in 1638, originated in the Franciscan province of Bosna Argentina during the Ottoman rule. Following the Ottoman conquest, a majority of Bosnians converted to Orthodoxy or Islam, and the Franciscans started promoting Catherine as a symbol of Bosnia's statehood and of its pre-Ottoman Catholic identity. This is particularly evident in Central Bosnia, where folk tradition concerning Catherine is most vivid. The life of Queen Catherine has been one of the most popular themes in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attracting the attention of scholars from the neighbouring countries of Croatia and Serbia as well. With the rise of ethnic nationalism, historians attempted to ascribe to her a particular national identity – Croat, Serb or Bosniak, which is completely anachronistic to medieval times. Due to her association with both of its eponymous historical regions, as well as her personal and close familial ties to Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Bosnian Christianity and Islam, Queen Catherine is increasingly becoming an important state symbol in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The anniversary of her death attracts more attention each year and is now marked with a \\"Mass for the Homeland\\". Schools, community centers, institutions and various associations are being named after the Queen. An official delegation of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina laid a wreath at her tomb for the first time in 2014. Moreover, Catherine is becoming a transethnic symbol, although mainly between Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks. Both groups tend to claim her as exclusively their own, as is the case with the rest of Bosnian medieval history. The political and religious leaders of the third group, Orthodox Serbs, also tend to claim Bosnian medieval history as exclusively their own but have not yet shown significant interest in Catherine herself.

Mechanisms of termination  In polymer chemistry, there are several mechanisms by which a polymerization reaction can terminate depending on the mechanism and circumstances of the reaction. A method of termination that applies to all polymer reactions is the depletion of monomer. In chain growth polymerization, two growing chains can collide head to head causing the growth of both of the chains to stop. In the case of radical or anionic polymerization, chain transfer can occur where the radical at the end of the growing chain can be transferred from the chain to an individual monomer unit causing a new chain to start growing and the previous chain to stop growing. With step-growth polymerization, the reaction can be terminated by adding a monofunctional species containing the same functionality as one or more of the types of monomer used in the reaction. For example, an alcohol R'-OH can be used to stop a reaction between a polyisocyanate and a polyol because it will react with the isocyanate functionality R-N=C=O to produce R-(N-H)-(C=O)-O-R' which is then no longer reactive with the polyol.  Termination of radical polymerization  The termination steps of free radical polymerization steps are of two types: recombination and disproportionation.Harry R. Allcock and Frederick W. Lampe Contemporary Polymer Chemistry (3rd ed., Prentice Hall 2003), p.70-72 In a recombination step, two growing chain radicals form a covalent bond in a single stable molecule. For the example of a vinyl polymer, :-------CH2–C°HX + -------CH2–C°HX → -------CH2–CH2X–CH2X–CH2\\\\------- Termination by recombination increases the chain length and therefore the molecular weight of the final polymer. In a disproportionation step, one radical transfers a hydrogen atom to the other to form two stable molecules: :-------CH2–C°HX + -------CH2–C°HX → -------CH2–CH2X + -------CH=CHX Termination by disproportionation usually has a higher activation energy since it involves breaking of one bond, and therefore is more important at higher energy.

He is also noted for design of pioneering cigar-hulled ships. Winans, one of the United States' first multi- millionaires, was involved in national and state politics, a southern- sympathizer and was a vehement \\"states' rights\\" advocate. His outspoken anti- federal stance as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, the lower chamber of the General Assembly, (state legislature) led to his temporary arrest on board a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train returning from an early session of the legislature held in the western Maryland town of Frederick to avoid the Union Army-occupied state capital of Annapolis in April–May, 1861, to consider the possibilities of state secession, during the early decisive period of the American Civil War. Winans was related to James McNeill Whistler through marriage (Whistler's brother George married Winans' daughter Julia). Early life Ross Winans was born in Vernon Township, New Jersey on October 17, 1796. His parents were William and Mary Winans. He married Julia de Kay (1800-1850) in 1820 and they had five children. He moved his family to Baltimore, Maryland in the late 1820s and did business with the newly founded Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B. & O.).Hager, Guy W.(2009). \\"Ross Winans (1796-1877).\\" Friends of Orianda House, Baltimore, Maryland. Following the death of his wife Julia in 1850, he married Elizabeth K. West (1807-1889) in 1854. Railroad Work Ross Winans by Whistler Winans came from a New Jersey family of horse breeders, but successfully made the transition to other forms of motive power. In 1828 he developed a friction wheel with outside bearings which established a distinctive pattern for railroad wheels for the next one hundred years or so. In the late 1820s also he became associated with the B&O;, eventually entering their service as an engineer. One of his first and more important tasks was to help the famous inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper, (1791-1883), of New York City build the new revolutionary \\"Tom Thumb\\" steam-powered locomotive, to eventually replace the horse-drawn rail cars then being pulled along the short route of the Baltimore and Ohio that had been built so far - from the city's waterfront temporary depot facing \\"The Basin\\" (today's \\"Inner Harbor\\") at East Pratt Street and South Charles Streets to the southwest 20-some miles to its first terminus at Ellicott Mills on the upper Western Branch of the Patapsco River. By 1831, he was appointed assistant engineer of machinery on the B. & O. He invented and patented an improvement in the construction of axles, or bearings on July 20, 1831. Also in this productive year he built the \\"Columbus\\", his first double-truck car, which he immediately patented, even though it is widely known he stole the idea for after the original inventor failed to do so. In 1835, Winans went into partnership with George Gillingham and in 1836 they succeeded to the 1834 lease of Phineas Davis and Israel Gardner of the B. & O. Company's shops at Mount Clare and continued the manufacture of locomotives and railroad machinery. \\"As far back perhaps as the year 1836, the firm of Gillingham and Winans, and, after the dissolution of that firm, I myself, down to 1841 or 1842, manufactured a Rail Road Wheel...\\" (letter #322). In 1841, he opened his own shop adjacent to the B. & O.'s new Mount Clare Shops, along West Pratt Street, between Arlington and Schroeder Streets in southwest Baltimore, with that railroad as his primary customer. He was a pioneer in the development of substituting coal-burning steam locomotives, for the less efficient wood- burners. He was eccentric, and his locomotive business made him independently wealthy. His customer relations were simple—he built engines his way, and you bought them. Bored with the business, and having a design disagreement with the B. & O., he closed his shops, which were later leased to the Hayward, Bartlett, and Co. iron and steel foundries. He went on to do significant work for the Czar's railroad from the new imperial capital St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea to the old traditional medieval capital of Moscow in central Russia. All of the listed engines are type 0-8-0, called the \\"Camel.\\" They were all acquired from predecessor roads. Engine sales to the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad (C. & P.) were recorded in 1863. James Millholland, the C. & P. Master Mechanic, was familiar with keeping these \\"Camel\\" engines running, and making improvements to them. Winans set trends in locomotive and car design rather than followed them. His steam locomotives, popularly known as \\"Crabs,\\" \\"Muddiggers,\\" and \\"Camels\\" were used all over the fledgling rail network of the burgeoning industrial northeastern United States, from the 1840s until after the turn of the 20th Century. The B. & O. was Winans' largest locomotive customer, with one hundred and forty locomotive deliveries going to that road. Winans had a disagreement with Mr. Hayes of the B. & O., which delayed delivery of some engines into 1863. Winans' second best customer was the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. These two customers represented 70 percent of his sales. Winans typically offered a thirty-day trial period at the customer site. About three hundred engine deliveries to twenty-six American railroads by Winans are documented during the period 1843–1863. He is also credited with being the first manufacture to export a locomotive to Europe. The Winans engine designs impressed a Russian delegation, and he was asked by the Czar to build the Imperial railroad from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Winans sent his two sons, as well as engineer George W. Whistler (father of painter James Whistler) to Russia for several years for that project. Winans may have sold as much or more equipment in Russia as he did in the United States, with both future 20th Century \\"super-powers\\" now setting the stage by building up their industrial and transportation networks on a continental scale, unknown in the smaller countries and kingdoms of Europe. Winans' son Thomas returned to build a Russian style estate in west Baltimore, named \\"Alexandrofsky\\", surrounded by a somewhat forbidding-looking wall which also enclosed an eclectic sculpture garden. Further west, another country estate of Italianate design with fieldstone walls in future suburban Baltimore County overlooking along the Gwynns Falls stream valley named \\"Crimea\\", off the Franklintown Road. \\"Alexandrofsky\\", located near what is now the Hollins Market, built in the 1830s, was demolished a century later to expand the housing stock of the city and fill in the regular street grid of white marble- stepped brick rowhouses. \\"Crimea\\" was later sold to the city, using a substantial money bequest from Mr Leakin in the 1920s to be set aside for purchasing a large parcel of property for a future park somewhere in the city. The Crimea purchase and park development was added to the Gwynn's Falls Park with the added name of Leakin Park. The contents of the \\"Crimea\\" mansion were sold at auction. Luckily, twenty-three boxes of Winans papers and journals were donated to the Maryland Historical Society in the old Enoch Pratt mansion on Park Avenue and West Monument Street in Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood for safekeeping. The new municipal park was designated and designed as a \\"wilderness forest reserve\\" to preserve the natural foresting along the stream valleys Gwynns Falls-Leakin still maintains the original fieldstone mansion, with extensive porches and balconies, with a variety of interior uses. Surrounding the estate is the remnants of an intriquing cannon embankment with slotted places for carved logs resembling iron artillery pieces, supposedly Winans' attempt to deter Northern troops from camping on his grounds, a testimony to his infamous pro-Southern sympathies. Also a water wheel apparatus still exists along the stream for drawing fresh water uphill along with a small family cemetery now wooded in by the forest. The Carrie Murray Nature Center was recently established here in the early 1980s in remembrance of the mother of a famous Baltimore Orioles baseball team player Eddie Murray of the time, who donated it, to educate and enlighten visiting school children from the Baltimore City Public Schools. A clap-board Gothic stylish small chapel also exists on the grounds along the entrance road, Eagle Driveway from West Forest Park Avenue. Winans' next important development in steam locomotive design was an 8-wheel connected freight locomotive in the early 1840s. In 1843, Gillingham and Winans built their own shop to maximize their profits. The company's most notable product was the \\"camelback locomotive\\". Winans quit the locomotive business in 1857 after a dispute with Henry Tyson, then head of motive power for the B. & O., over the use of leading bogies (trucks) on his locomotives. Winans generated a great many patents and was heavily engaged in litigation (legal lawsuits) over ideas he claimed as his own. The majority of the Winans engines were burden (freight) as opposed to passenger type. Engines delivered after June 1848 are almost all of the Camel 0-8-0 type, favored by Winans. The early models are sometimes referred to as the \\"Baltimore engines\\". The \\"Camel\\" name derives from the first of class of that name, delivered to the B. & O. in 1848. All \\"Camel\\" engines were of the 0-8-0 wheel arrangement. Winans did not believe in the use of leading (pony) trucks. The \\"Camel\\" engines were all low-speed, heavy haul units. The speed was limited to 10–15 miles per hour by the steam capacity of the boiler, and the lack of a pilot truck. However, at that speed, a single \\"Camel\\" could haul a 110 car train of loaded coal hoppers on the level. The most distinctive feature of the \\"Camel\\" was the cab atop the boiler. They had a large steam dome, slide valves, and used staybolts in the boiler. More than 100 iron tubes, each over long, were installed in the boiler. A \\"Camel\\" was about long, with an wheelbase. There were three major variations: the short, medium, and long furnace models. The small units had 17\\" × 22\\" cylinders, and the others had 19\\" × 22\\" cylinders. The medium unit had about of grate area, expanded to more than in the large furnace model. The long furnace model had a firebox more than long, requiring lever-operated chutes for the fireman to feed the front of the fire. The fireman worked in the tender, as the firebox was behind the drivers. This design required that the drawbar passed beneath the firebox, and it typically heated to a cherry red color. Even after rebuilds with a more conventional cab design, the fireman worked in the tender. The standard Camel engine had 43\\" wheels, and was painted green. \\"Camel\\" tenders were 8-wheeled, generally with brakes on the rear truck only. They held 5 tons of coal, and 8 tons (more than 2000 gallons) of water. Fully loaded, the tenders weighted 23 tons, only 4 tons less than the locomotive. Ten \\"Camels\\" were delivered to the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad, which was running its lines from the north near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania including one \\"engine sold them from Maryland Mining Co., $8000 cash.\\" Ten more sales were also recorded to the B. & S.'s successor line, the Northern Central Railway. Two units went to the Elmira & Canandaguia Railroad in New York, and were subsequently sold to the Cumberland & Pennsylvania. The P. & R. engine \\"Susquehanna\\" is described in detail in rail historian White's book (ref. 71). Two Winans engines went to the Huntingdon & Broad Top Mountain (H. & B.T.M.) Railroad in southwestern Pennsylvania in 1863. One unit blew up in 1868, with the loss of four lives. The H. & B.T.M. ran along the west side of Broad Top Mountain, best known for the narrow gauge line on its east side, the East Broad Top Railroad. The C. & P. interchanged with the H. & B.T.M. at State Line, Pennsylvania. Most of the Winans \\"Camel\\" engines sold for around $10,000. Engine sales were expedited by syndicates of what we would now call investment bankers, such as Mr. Enoch Pratt. Banks did not yet have the accumulated capital to make loans for commercial purposes. The records of the Philadelphia & Reading contain detailed information on \\"Camel\\" engine mileage's and rebuildings. This line received a series of forty-eight deliveries from 1846 to 1855. By 1858, the P. & R. had racked up in excess of 3.5 million miles on its 44 engines, with the \\"Camel\\" fleet representing 20 percent of the P. & R. motive power roster. By the end of the Civil War period in 1865, 28 of its 48 engines had not yet been rebuilt. By 1870, only 4 of the 48 were not yet rebuilt, but these four had accumulated almost one million miles of road service. The average service life before a rebuild was about thirteen and one-half years. Similar data for the B. & O. gives an average service life of 8.5 years before rebuilding. A total of 15 \\"Camel\\" rebuilds are recorded at the C. & P. shops in Mount Savage, Pennsylvania from 1866 through 1875. There are only three documented catastrophic failures in \\"Camel\\" engines. Non-catastrophic failures were more prevalent, but fewer were documented. Railroad historian/author Roberts (reference 48) gives the performance of a Winans \\"Camel\\" on the B. & O.’s grade, circa 1855, as 144 trailing tons. Rail historian James Dilts (reference 17) gives the performance of B&O; engine 71 as 117 trailing tons up a 2.2 percent grade at . Engine 71 was a Winans \\"Camel\\", built in April 1851. The Winans engine could haul 40 empty coal hoppers up the Eckhart Branch, based on a tare weight of 3 tons for the Winans-designed 6-wheel hoppers in use in 1854. Civil War politics During the Civil War Winans was elected a member of the Maryland House of Delegates (the lower house of the state legislature) for the 1861 special sessions called to discuss the issue of secession,Archives of Maryland: Historical List: House of Delegates, Baltimore City (1790–1864) and was arrested twice due to his anti-Federal activities and speeches. On the day before the Baltimore riot of 1861, Winans moved a resolution \\"protest[ing] in the name of the people of Maryland against the garrisoning of Southern forts by militia drawn from the free States\\" and 'calling upon citizens of the state unite \\"to repel, if need be, any invader who may come to establish a military despotism over us.\\" He was arrested shortly after the riot, was released, and elected again on April 24 as part of a States Rights ticket. Meanwhile, Winans' firm was reportedly preparing weapons and munitions for the defense of Baltimore against union troops. According to the American of April 23, \\"At the works of the Mssrs. Winans, the entire force is engaged in the making of pikes, and in casting balls of very description...\\" (Brown, 65). On May 14, one day after martial law was declared in Baltimore, Winans was again arrested while returning from a special session of the Maryland legislature in Frederick (the session in which the Maryland legislature considered, but ultimately rejected, secession). He was quickly released, after signing a \\"parole\\" guaranteeing his loyalty to the federal government. Winans' arrest, by Benjamin Butler's Federal troops, was one of the cases where Lincoln's emergency suspension of habeas corpus was employed. Winans' brief incarceration was not legally challenged, as it was in the case of Johns Merryman (Ex parte Merryman). While Winans is often credited as the inventor of the Winans Steam Gun, said to be among the weapons bought from the five hundred thousand dollar fund that Baltimore Mayor Brown and Maryland Governor Hicks gathered \\"for the defense of the city. This experimental weapon was in fact not designed by Winans, but was invented by Charles S. Dickinson, and built in Boston in 1860. It passed through Winan's machine shop during the period when his workers were making pikes, shot and other items ordered by city authorities. When it emerged, its former history was forgotten, and word spread that it was built by Winan's to oppose Federal troops. Though this novelty ultimately had no military impact, it was widely discussed at the time and its connection to Winans, along with his political views reputation as a threat to federal control of Maryland. The Russian Connection, and the Czar's St. Petersburg Railroad Railroad construction began to be of interest in Russia in the 1830s. Two colonels were sent to the United States as a Russian Railroad Mission to assess the State of the Art. The Tsar was interested in a new passenger locomotive on the Reading, a design of Moncure Robinson. The Colonels reported back favorably on American Railroad practice, and recommended Major George Washington Whistler as consultant for the project. Various gauges were in use on American lines. Whistler went to St. Petersburg in 1842. He recommended a 5-foot gauge. Whistler got things going, but he died of Cholera in 1849. T. S. Brown, an American, was his replacement. Whistler's son (the painter) and his wife (the subject of the famous painting) went to England. Another son, George, stayed until his death in 1869. Whistler recommended that Winans take charge of the mechanical works at St. Petersburg. The Russian Colonels also wanted Joseph Harrison, of Eastwick & Harrison of Philadelphia to construct the rolling stock, under a contract for three million dollars. The company had built a locomotive in 1839, the Gowan and Marx, an 11-ton 4-4-0 unit for the Philadelphia and Reading. this locomotive had several technological innovations, which impressed the Russians. The boiler was set over the driving wheels, resulting in excellent traction. Also, Eastwick and Harrison of Philadelphia introduced the equalizing lever, a spring suspension that distributed the engine's weight over three points. In this arrangement, each of the four driving wheels could bounce independently as the engine negotiated rough track, greatly improving stability and traction. Later add-ons to the Russian contract, included another two million dollars, partially for the cast-iron bridge over the Neva River, the first time the river had been bridged. Much of the machinery for the railroad, and the equipment came from the United States. Winans brought a \\"large and powerful locomotive\\" as well as \\"three steam pile driving machines.\\" Four Otis steam shovels were imported from the U. S. By the order of the Czar, equipment was brought in duty-free. The firm Harrison, Winans, and Eastwick was organized in Russia for the venture. Winans had impressed the Russians with his rail wagons, and he was invited to go to Russia and set up a factory. He declined, but sent his sons Thomas and William. Harrison sent a large portion of his Philadelphia manufacturing machinery to Russia, and installed it at the Alexandrovsky Works at St. Petersburg. This factory produced locomotives and rolling stock. It had a 5-year contract to develop locomotives and rolling stock. They impressed the Czar by finishing a year early, and secured a new contract. They eventually got a third extension, but were subsequently bought out by a Russian government entity, formed to operate the facility and the railroad. Thomas Winans followed in his father's footsteps, and was on a trip to deliver locomotives to the Boston and Albany, when he met George W. Whistler. Whistler was impressed by the young man. This meeting lead to the very lucrative Russian Contracts. The Moscow to St. Petersburg Railway by built under the direction of Czar Nicholas I to connect his summer palace and his winter palace. There was a concern that the railway would enable social upheaval if the serfs were allowed to travel, so the service was restricted to the affluent and the aristocracy. The serfs were used to do the heavy labor, with a reported large loss of life. This is documented in the poem, The Railway, by Nikolay Nekrasov. After 10 years of construction, the line opened in November 1851. George Washington Whistler was involved with the Czar on the rail project, as a consulting engineer. Winans was related to James McNeill Whistler through marriage (Whistler's brother George married Winans' daughter Julia) Another participant was John Hazelhurst Latrobe, son of the B&O;'s Benjamin Latrobe. He served as legal council for Winans, because he spoke Russian. The Winans Brothers and Harrison bought out the interests of Eastwick, and formed a company for operations and future railroad construction. Winans and Eastwick also seemed to get involved in the manufacturing of gunpowder in Russia. This was eyed by American gunpowder manufacturer DuPont with some suspicion.. The Crimean War had broken out in 1854. The U. S. Department of State was consulted, and Winans was assured that U. S. interests were not involved. William Winans served for a while as U. S. vice-consul to Russia at St. Petersburg, but resigned to continue his private business. The great St. Petersburg fire in May 1862 was partially contained by a steam pump from the Winans factory. A financial crisis in 1865-66 lead to the Russian Finance Minister initiating a special Railroad Fund to ensure continuity of operations. One key point was the privatization of the railroad. The Winans' contract with the government was highly profitable for William Winans, but was draining the Imperial coffers. The Czar raised some money by selling Russian America (Alaska) to the Americans, and decided the privatization of the railroad would proceed. It was to go to the recently formed Grand Society of Russian Railroads. Winans was seen as \\"the robber of the Russian Treasury.\\" Russian America was sold for nine million rubles, and Winans received six and a half mission. William Winans retired to England with an estimated 25 million rubles ($18–29 million). He wisely used some of this to buy shares in the new railroad venture in Russia, and became an influential, but not controlling, stockholder. The St. Petersburg to Moscow remains in daily operation at this writing. References from the Journal of the Railroad and Locomotive Historical Society: The Cigar Ship (or Boat) Engraving of the first Winans cigar ship/boat from the \\"Illustrated London News\\", 1858 In the mid-19th Century, Winans and his son Thomas designed and built a series of spindle-shaped boats, usually referred to as the \\"cigar ships\\" or \\"cigar boats\\". The first was constructed in 1858 and featured an unprecedented (and in the end, technically unfeasible) midship propeller, enclosed in a shroud. This propeller was driven by steam engines located in each hull section. The intent was to allow the ship to progress with less disturbance from weather and waves. This ship was discussed at length in the pages of the \\"Scientific American\\" national journal/magazine, and in the end remained tied up at the Winans docks at Ferry Bar, southside of the Whetstone Point peninsula and along the north shore of the Middle Branch or Ferry Branch of the Patapsco River, just west of old Fort Covington and Fort Babcock which supported Fort McHenry in the September 1814 Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812 for many years, (later the site of the Port Covington railroad and harbor piers of the Western Maryland Railway built in the late 1890s and early 1900s) after a series of trials and modifications. It was never subjected to a sea trial. In his own words, \\"the length of the vessel was more than eleven times it breadth of beam, being 16 feet wide by 108 feet long.\\" It included four high pressure steam engines, driving a large iron wheel with fins amidships. It did achieve a speed of 12 miles per hour on its trial in January 1859. He then lengthened the ship to 194, and then 235 feet. It went to England for further trials, but was never a great success. After the Civil War, Winans and his son took their enterprise to Europe, and several similarly-designed boats were built in England and in St. Petersburg, Russia. None of these were also put to full sea trials, though press reports survive of trips in the Solent and the English Channel. The boats themselves remained tied up in Southampton into the 1880s, but inspired no imitators. The Russian Naval Journal reported on the ships in 1858. Winans shifted his interests outside of the United States during the Civil War. His son William had gained experience in naval construction during the Crimean War, outfitting gunboats for the defense of St. Petersburg. The Railroad Shops at Alexandrovsky were employed for the Naval work. Winans presented a proposal to the Russian Government entitled, \\"War Vehicles on the Spindle Principle,\\" July 1861. This was favorably received by the Grand Duke Nuikolaevich, Chief of the Russian Navy. A Winans Cigar boat was tested on the Neva River, and ran to Kronstadt, where it conducted tests in the Gulf of Finland. The Russian Shipbuilding Technical Committee were not impressed.. Winans then proposed to the U. S. Government the design of his ships, in what he saw as a pending conflict with England. Nothing came of this. Winans took his cigar boat construction to England with his experimental Russian craft loaded on the British steamboat Nautilus. He built another cigar ship in Havre, France. He constructed a private yacht for himself in England, the fourth cigar ship. It was launched in 1866 on the Thames. Winans wanted to register his yacht at the Imperial Saint Petersburg Yacht Club. Numerous problems preventing the ship making the voyage. Thomas Winans stayed for a time in Russia and contracted with the Czar's government to develop Russian railroads. Other Interests Winans took an interest in sanitary engineering and public health, publishing a number of pamphlets on sanitation, particularly in regard to water and ventilation. He lobbied for the development of a public water supply for Baltimore City. Winans was a pioneer in the development of low income housing building a housing project he called \\"workingmen's housing\\" in Baltimore. Today a public housing project remains on the site and is named Mount Winans. He also published religious writings, including a pamphlet on religious tolerance and a collection of Unitarian sermons. The Winans' cigar ship and its shape inspired Captain Nemo's submarine ship, in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. Death Winans died in Baltimore on April 11, 1877 at the age of 81. Sources * Bell, J.

He was made President of Haiti on March 1, 1846. Life Riché was born free, the son of a prominent free black man of the same name in the North Province of Saint- Domingue (the French colony that later became Haiti). His father was a sergeant in the colonial militia and probably served in the rebel forces. Riché himself joined the Haitian Revolutionaries probably some time in 1801. After Haiti gained independence at the end of the revolution in 1803, Riché joined the forces of Henri Christophe, who in 1807 promoted him to the rank of general and deputy commander of his army. During the civil war that followed between Alexandre Pétion and Christophe, Riché was instrumental in Christophe's victory at the Battle of Siebert on January 1, 1807.During the siege of Port-au-Prince in 1811, Riché commanded the left wing of Christophe's army. A loyal officer, Riché quickly became one of Christophe's most trusted commanders, and as a consequence he was placed in command of Haïti's Northern Province, where he was effective in subduing the mulatto population.When Henry Christophe became King in 1811, He proclaimed him Count of Grande-Riviere-du- Nord. When the Kingdom was abolished in 1820 after Prince Jacques-Victor Henry's death, he lost the title of Count of Grande-Riviere-du-Nord. Presidency After Christophe's downfall in 1820, Riché supported the new government and was therefore able to retain his post during the subsequent administration of Jean-Pierre Boyer, and those that followed. This continued until Jean-Louis Pierrot became President of Haïti in 1845. Pierrot attempted to reform the Haitian government, causing the Boyerist hierarchy of Haiti to sponsor a rebellion in the provinces of Port-au-Prince and Artibonite in 1846. The rebel army under mulatto control proclaimed Riché president of Haiti on March 1, 1846. After much of the Haitian army sided with the rebels, President Pierrot relinquished his office on March 24, 1846. After gaining the presidency of Haiti, one of Riché's first acts was to restore the Constitution of 1816. As president, Riché was considered a failure by his Boyerist backers. Originally intended to be a figurehead, Riché quickly began to take an active role. He soon proposed reforms similar to those espoused by former President Pierrot. Probably as a result of these proposals he died on February 27, 1847, possibly from being poisoned, although this has never been established. Riché's presidency, considered ineffective by historians, opened the way for considerable changes in the political landscape of Haiti during the succeeding administrations. As a result, his presidency can be considered a turning point in the history of Haitian politics. After Riché's death in 1847, he was replaced by Faustin-Élie Soulouque, who was anticipated to be similar to Riché. Soulouque later appointed himself Emperor Faustin I.

Devaraj Urs (20 August 1915 – 6 June 1982) was an Indian politician who served two terms as the eighth Chief Minister of Karnataka (1972–77, 1978–80), a state in southern India. He entered politics in 1952 and was an MLA for 10 years. When the Indian National Congress split in 1969 as Samstha(Congress(O)) and Indira Congress (Congress (R)), he stood with Indira Gandhi. He became the Chief Minister of Karnataka (fifth Assembly) for the first time from 20 March 1972 to 31 December 1977 and later for the second time from 17 March 1978 to 8 June 1980 (sixth Assembly). Early life D. Devaraj Urs was born at Kallahalli Hunsur Taluk, Mysore district, the then Kingdom of Mysore. His father, also named Devaraj Urs, was a land-owner and his mother, Devira Ammanni, was a pious and traditional lady. His younger brother, Kemparaj Urs was an actor. The family belonged to the Arasu community and were very distant relatives to the Wodeyar royal family. Urs was married to 11-year-old Chikkammanni (or Chikka Ammani), a girl from his own community and from a suitable family, in a match arranged by their parents when he was almost 15. The marriage proved to be harmonious and conventional. They had three daughters – Chandra Prabha, Nagrathna and Bharathi. Urs had his primary and high school education at the Urs Boarding School in Mysore, which had been set up by the Maharaja of Mysore expressly to provide suitable education to the sons of the Arasu community, to equip them for higher responsibilities in their adulthood. After passing school, Urs studied at the Central College in Bengaluru and took a BSc Degree. Politics After completing his education, Urs returned to Kallahalli and engaged himself in agriculture, overseeing the extensive lands owned by his family. However, his innate leadership quality did not permit him to stay in the village and brought him to politics. Urs entered politics in 1952 by contesting the first elections held in the country after it attained independence. At this time, the Maharaja was still the head of state in Mysore (until 1956), the state retained the same boundaries as before independence, and the Arasu community was entrenched in the countryside due to centuries of ties with village communities. Urs easily won a seat to the state legislature and served as a member of the legislative assembly for ten years (two successive terms). An Indian National Congress party leader from Mysore, Urs was a member of the intra-party \\"Syndicate\\" of powerful regional leaders. However, he was never as antagonistic towards Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as other leaders of the Syndicate, such as K. Kamaraj. When push came to shove, he chose to abandon the Syndicate and go with Indira Gandhi. Urs had practically retired from politics when the first Congress split took place in 1969, and the Syndicate formed the Congress (O) ('O'for \\"Organization\\") while Indira Gandhi formed the Congress (R). The Congress (O), under S. Nijalingappa, Veerendra Patil, Ramakrishna Hegde and Deve Gowda dominated Karnataka electorally and had a majority in the state assembly, but Urs declined an invitation to join it. Instead, he agreed to lead the Congress (R) in the state and helped win all the 27 seats at the 1971 Lok Sabha elections and majority in the 1972 legislative assembly elections. Under his leadership Congress(R) won 165/216 seats, thus garnering more than 75% of the seats. Congress(O) came a distant second with 24 seats. Independents won 20 seats. CPI won 3 while BJS, the earlier avatar of BJP stood second in 16 seats, winning none . He was chief minister of Karnataka for the full term of the assembly from 1972 to December 1977. In January 1978, he joined Congress (I) as Mrs Gandhi split the party yet again. The new party won the assembly elections in February 1978 and Urs was appointed Chief Minister. But in 1979, he left Congress(I) following differences with Indira Gandhi, and joined the other Congress faction, Congress(S). He continued to be CM as many MLAs joined him. https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/of-a-political-landmark-in- bengaluru/article6625410.ece The other Congress faction was even known as Congress(Urs) briefly when he became its president. But in the 1980 Lok Sabha elections, his party won just one seat in Karnataka. Most MLAs in his camp deserted him to re-join Congress(I) and Gundu Rao became Chief Minister in January 1980. Urs then formed the Karnataka Kranti Ranga in 1982, a few months before his death. Chief Minister of Mysore=Dates in power During the Fifth Assembly of Karnataka State, D. Devaraj Urs was the Chief Minister from 20-03-1972 to 31-12-1977. President's Rule was imposed from 31-12-1977 to 28-02-1978 in the run-up to 1978 election. The Sixth Assembly lasted its five- year term, from 17 March 1978 to 8 June 1983. Devraj Urs was Chief Minister from 28-02-1978 to 07-01-1980, first with Congress(I) up to 24-June-1979, and then Congress(S) when he was expelled from Congress(I) following differences with Indira Gandhi. https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/forty-years-ago- june-25-1979-congress-expels-urs-5797855/ When Mrs Gandhi swept to power in Delhi in January 1980, most of the MLAs backing him re-joined Congress(I). Devaraj Urs was ousted and succeeded by R. Gundu Rao as CM in January 1980. https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/of-a-political-landmark-in- bengaluru/article6625410.ece * 20-03-1972 to 31-12-1977. Karnataka CM (Congress) * 28-02-1978 to July 1979. Karnataka CM (Congress (Indira)) * July 1979 to 07-January-1980. Karnataka CM (Congress(Socialist)) Tenure Devaraj Urs' tenure is particularly remembered for his reforms that targeted the depressed classes of Karnataka, namely the scheduled castes and the other backward castes. In response to the prime minister's declaration that poverty was her first priority (\\"Garibi Hatao!\\") and her Twenty-Point Programme, Urs formed a state cabinet dominated by technocrats and academics. His priority was land reform, and his slogan was \\"Land to the tiller\\"; under him a sustained effort was made to equalize the land distribution through much of the state. Karnataka, thus, other than the communist bastions of Kerala and West Bengal, has had one of the most successful land redistributions in the country. A side-effect of this was to break the hold of the previously dominant Lingayat and Vokkaliga castes over local politics. He was helped in his endeavours by his colleagues Huchamasti Gowda, B Subbayya Shetty and others from his cabinet. Other schemes included the building of shelters for migrant workers; the forgiveness of rural debt; and, in a populist masterstroke, a plan to have an electric bulb in every house. When R. K. Baliga, founder of Electronics City proposed the concept of developing the electronic city in the early 1970s it was met with skepticism but Devaraj Urs supported him and approved the project. This initial seed investment by the Karnataka State Government in 1976 laid the foundation for Electronics City. In 1979, however, he exited Congress (I). He had quarrelled with Indira Gandhi, and was appearing before the Supreme Court in Karnataka vs. Union of India, and thus felt the time was right to cut his losses and leave the Congress. This was a miscalculation because although many legislators in Karnataka, Kerala and Goa went with him – such as A. K. Antony, Priyaranjan Das Munshi and K. P. Unnikrishnan – Mrs. Gandhi swept back to power at the national level and the fledgling Congress (Urs) was routed. Urs subsequently joined the Janata Party, and his protégé Ramakrishna Hegde recaptured power in Karnataka from the Congress in 1984. The Congress (Urs) itself became Congress (S) in 1983. Achievements Urs espoused the causes of poor and ushered in a \\"silent social revolution\\" in Karnataka. He was the voice of the poor and stood for the cause of the downtrodden in society. Urs was elected continuously from Hunsur as an MLA for 28 years, from 1952 to 1980 and is one of the longest serving Chief Ministers of Karnataka. Among the contributions of the late Chief Minister was the stress laid on the education of the people belonging to the backward classes and establishment of the backwards and minorities hostels for the students hailing from those sections of society. Absorbing 16,000 unemployed graduates in the stipendiary scheme whose services were confirmed later, abolition of carrying night soil by Dalits and bonded labour, renaming Mysuru as Karnataka in 1973 were some landmark decisions taken by him. D. Devaraj Urs was one of the greatest social reformers the State had seen. The land reforms spearheaded by him, in which the tiller of the land became the owner, was exemplary. It reduced the chasm between the rich and the poor, doing away with social inequality. Mysore district had the highest incidents of bonded labour in India during that time and the decision of the Urs Government to abolish it was remarkable. Urs must be remembered for his achievements in weaning away poor people from the clutches of the rich moneylenders. The deeds of the late Chief Minister in the irrigation sector too had helped the farmer community tremendously. The Kali project, one of them, was executed amidst opposition from several quarters. his measures brought several changes but his land reforms brought poverty to many families who were solely dependent on their small land holdings.

They are artifacts caused by light diffracting around the support vanes of the secondary mirror in reflecting telescopes, or edges of non-circular camera apertures, and around eyelashes and eyelids in the eye. Diffraction spikes due to support vanes The optics of a Newtonian reflector telescope with four spider vanes supporting the secondary mirror. These cause the four spike diffraction pattern commonly seen in astronomical images. In the vast majority of reflecting telescope designs, the secondary mirror has to be positioned at the central axis of the telescope and so has to be held by struts within the telescopes tube. No matter how fine these support rods are they diffract the incoming light from a subject star and this appears as diffraction spikes which are the Fourier transform of the support struts. The spikes represent a loss of light that could have been used to image the star.Internal Reflections and Diffraction Spikes. Caltech. Accessed April 2010 Although diffraction spikes can obscure parts of a photograph and are undesired in professional contexts, some amateur astronomers like the visual effect they give to bright stars – the \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" appearance – and even modify their refractors to exhibit the same effect,https://web.archive.org/web/20120203213753/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jan.rek/equipment.htm#starspike or to assist with focusing when using a CCD.http://astronomy.qteaser.com/diffspike.html A small number of reflecting telescopes designs avoid diffraction spikes by placing the secondary mirror off-axis. Early off-axis designs such as the Herschelian and the Schiefspiegler telescopes have serious limitations such as astigmatism and long focal ratios, which make them useless for research. The brachymedial design by Ludwig Schupmann, which uses a combination of mirrors and lenses, is able to correct chromatic aberration perfectly over a small area and designs based on the Schupmann brachymedial are currently used for research of double stars. There are also a small number of off-axis unobstructed all-reflecting anastigmats which give optically perfect images. Refracting telescopes and their photographic images do not have the same problem as their lenses are not supported with spider vanes. Diffraction spikes due to non-circular aperture Iris diaphragms with moving blades are used in most modern camera lenses to restrict the light received by the film or sensor. While manufacturers attempt to make the aperture circular for a pleasing bokeh, when stopped down to high f-numbers (small apertures), its shape tends towards a polygon with the same number of sides as blades. Diffraction spreads out light waves passing through the aperture perpendicular to the roughly-straight edge, each edge yielding two spikes 180° apart. As the blades are uniformly distributed around the circle, on a diaphragm with an even number of blades, the diffraction spikes from blades on opposite sides overlap. Consequently, a diaphragm with n blades yields n spikes if n is even, and 2n spikes if n is odd.

In vision In normal vision, diffraction through eyelashes – and due to the edges of the eyelids if one is squinting – produce many diffractions spikes. If it is windy, then the motion of the eyelashes cause spikes that move around and scintillate. After a blink, the eyelashes may come back in a different position and cause the diffraction spikes to jump around. This is classified as an Entoptic phenomenon. Other uses of diffraction spikes=Special effects Effect of a triangular star filter A cross screen filter, also known as a star filter, creates a star pattern using a very fine diffraction grating embedded in the filter, or sometimes by the use of prisms in the filter. The number of stars varies by the construction of the filter, as does the number of points each star has. A similar effect is achieved by photographing bright lights through a window screen with vertical and horizontal wires. The angles of the bars of the cross depend on the orientation of the screen relative to the camera. Bahtinov mask Use of diffraction spikes to focus a telescope with a Bahtinov mask In amateur astrophotography, a Bahtinov mask can be used to focus small astronomical telescopes accurately. Light from a bright point such as an isolated bright star reaching different quadrants of the primary mirror or lens is first passed through grilles at three different orientations. Half of the mask generates a narrow \\"X\\" shape from four diffraction spikes (blue and green in the illustration); the other half generates a straight line from two spikes (red). Changing the focus causes the shapes to move with respect to each other. When the line passes exactly through the middle of the \\"X\\", the telescope is in focus and the mask can be removed.

A cupola with a clock sits on the roof. The Pennsylvania State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Pennsylvania located in downtown Harrisburg which was designed by architect Joseph Miller Huston in 1902 and completed in 1906 in a Beaux-Arts style with decorative Renaissance themes throughout. The capitol houses the legislative chambers for the Pennsylvania General Assembly, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme and Superior Courts of Pennsylvania, as well as the offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor. It is also the main building of the Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex. The seat of government for the state was originally in Philadelphia, then was relocated to Lancaster in 1799 and finally to Harrisburg in 1812. The current capitol, known as the Huston Capitol, is the third state capitol building to be built in Harrisburg. The first, the Hills Capitol, was destroyed in 1897 by a fire and the second, the Cobb Capitol, was left unfinished when funding was discontinued in 1899. President Theodore Roosevelt attended the building's dedication in 1906. After its completion, the capitol project was the subject of a graft scandal. The construction and subsequent furnishing cost three times more than the General Assembly had appropriated for the design and construction; architect, Joseph Huston and four others were convicted of graft for price gouging. The Pennsylvania State Capitol is often referred to as a \\"palace of art\\" because of its many sculptures, murals and stained-glass windows, most of which are Pennsylvania themed or were made by Pennsylvanians. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006; the boundaries of the designation were expanded to include the Capitol Complex in 2013 with the capitol as a contributing property. History William Penn formed the first government of the then-Province of Pennsylvania on October 28, 1682, in Chester, Pennsylvania. The government did not have a regular meeting place and often met in Quaker meeting houses or at private residences in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania's first statehouse, now known as Independence Hall, was built in Philadelphia starting in 1732 and was completed in 1753. With both the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the First and Second Continental Congresses, and the Confederation Congress, three predecessors of the modern Congress of the United States occupying Independence Hall from 1774 to 1789, the state legislature considered proposals for moving the seat of the state government. John Harris, Jr. offered to give and 21 square perches (5,717 ft2; 531 m2) of land near the banks of the Susquehanna River in central Pennsylvania to the state, provided that it be eventually used as the site of the capital. Harris also laid out a city in 1785, near his plot of land, and named it in honor of his father. In 1799, the legislature voted to relocate the capital to Lancaster instead of Harrisburg, because of Lancaster's greater population. From 1799 to 1812, the legislature resided in Lancaster at the Old City Hall.  Hills Capitol  The legislature voted in 1810 to relocate the capital again, and moved the seat of government to Harrisburg in October 1812 onto the land originally given by Harris a decade earlier. An additional was also purchased from United States Senator William Maclay. The legislature met in the old Dauphin County courthouse for the next decade until a new capitol was constructed. A competition was held to determine the design of the capitol starting in 1816, which \\"was the first formal contest for [designing] an American statehouse\\". The designs submitted, including one from William Strickland, were rejected as being too expensive. Another contest was started in January 1819. Of the seventeen designs submitted, two were selected as semifinalists. One was from Harrisburg architect Stephen Hills and the other was from the designer of the Washington Monument, Robert Mills; Hills' design was selected. Hills had designed a \\"red-brick, Federal-style\\" capitol to \\"architecturally represent the function of democratic government.\\" Construction began on the Hills Capitol in 1819 and it was completed in 1822. The capitol's construction and subsequent furnishing was estimated to have cost $244,500. The Hills Capitol was visited by famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Abraham Lincoln visited the capitol in 1861 as president- elect, and then his body lay in state there after his 1865 assassination. Pennsylvania's collection of Civil War battle flags, which were accumulated in 1866, was moved from the State Arsenal to the second floor of the capitol in 1872. The flags were moved, again, in 1895 to the Executive, Library and Museum Building. On February 2, 1897, around noon, smoke was discovered coming from the Lieutenant Governor's offices. By early evening, the Hills Capitol had been reduced to a \\"smoldering mass of debris\\".  Cobb Capitol  alt=A sepia-toned photograph of a large, rectangular building. After the destruction of the Hills Capitol, the now \\"homeless\\" legislature moved to a nearby Methodist Church. There were soon demands that the capital be relocated to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia; the legislature quickly appropriated money to build a new capitol in Harrisburg. Governor Daniel H. Hastings opted for a pay-as-you-go policy to allow the construction costs to be spread over multiple annual budgets. Governor Hastings also figured that $550,000 was enough to build \\"a small legislative building\\" that could be added onto as needed over time. After building designs were submitted by various architects in another competition, Henry Ives Cobb was chosen in 1897 to design the new capitol. Construction of the Cobb Capitol began on May 2, 1898. The legislature met in the finished building, which they had deemed complete, even though it was an \\"unadorned, unfinished, several-story brown brick structure that looked like a factory\\", on January 3, 1899. Cobb himself described the building simply as \\"ugly\\" but believed that he would be able to finish it eventually, when more funding became available.  Huston Capitol  The capitol building, photographed by William H. Rau shortly after its dedication Governor William A. Stone appointed a new Capitol Building Commission in 1901. The commission then held another design competition, for Pennsylvania architects only, which prevented Cobb, a Chicagoan, from submitting a design or finishing his capitol. The Building Commission also stipulated that parts of the unfinished, current capitol were to be used in the new capitol. The General Assembly had appropriated $4 million for the construction of the capitol. It did not limit the total amount to be used in furnishing the building. This caused problems after construction completion of the capitol. The American Institute of Architects was opposed to competition, citing that the terms of the competition were \\"calculated to only 'encourage favoritism and injustice' and that they in no way obligated the Capitol [Building] Commission to select the best design or the best architect\\". The Institute also advised that no Pennsylvania architects enter the competition; Philadelphia architect Addison Hutton was subsequently expelled from the organization after submitting an entry. Joseph Miller Huston's design was chosen from among nine entries in the competition in January 1902. The ground was broken for the Huston Capitol on November 2, 1902, but the cornerstone was not laid until May 5, 1904. Ownership of the capitol was handed over to the state government on August 15, 1906, and the Capitol Building Commission was dissolved. Stereo card of President Roosevelt at the 1906 dedication of the Huston Capitolalt=Two identical photos of a man looking out over a large crowd. The images are mounted side-by-side on a card. Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker dedicated the new capitol on October 4, 1906. Former Governor Stone, who had become president of the Building Commission after leaving office, ceremoniously gave the key to the capitol to Governor Pennypacker. President Theodore Roosevelt, who had arrived earlier that morning by a special train to deliver a speech and tour the new capitol, declared it \\"the handsomest building I ever saw\\". The Pennsylvania, Northern Central, Reading, and Cumberland Valley railroads each ran special trains to accommodate the crowds traveling to and from Harrisburg for the dedication. Although the building was completed, the majority of the artwork in and around the capitol would not be completed for another two decades. The murals in the rotunda were not installed until 1908 and the sculptures outside the entrance to the capitol were dedicated on October 4, 1911. The collection of Civil War flags were removed from the Executive, Library and Museum Building. After a parade and a ceremony, they were installed in glass display cases in the capitol rotunda on June 14, 1914. The decoration of the capitol was completed on May 23, 1927, when the murals in the Supreme Court Chambers were unveiled. = Graft scandal = William H. Berry was elected in 1906, shortly after the dedication, to the office of State Treasurer on a reform \\"fusion ticket\\". Berry was the only Democrat elected to a statewide office from 1895 to 1934. His successful campaign was deemed by Governor Pennypacker to be \\"one of those freaks of ill fortune\\". Berry began investigating the costs of the capitol project and brought its $13 million pricetag to the attention of the public. Part of the reason for the discrepancy was Pennsylvania's \\"over-elaborate\\" and sometimes \\"unintelligible\\" method of \\"ordering and purchasing supplies, equipment [and] furnishings, commonly called the 'per-foot rule' \\". Because the methods of measuring under the \\"per-foot rule\\" were not rigorously enforced, furnishing could be, intentionally, overpriced by the supplier. For example, a flagpole installed on the capitol roof was priced at $850; Berry estimated the value of the pole to have been only $150. Other expenses included $1,619 for a $125 bootblack stand and $3,257 for a $325 \\"mahogany case in the Senate barber shop\\". Pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with the capitol were reasonable in comparison with similar notable structures. He pointed out that the United States Capitol cost $18 million, but had \\"fifty-five less [rooms] than the Capitol at Harrisburg.\\" Pennypacker also showed how the New York State Capitol had cost $24 million, and was still unfinished. After an investigation, a total of five people, including Huston, were convicted, on December 18, 1908, and sentenced to two years in prison for \\"conspiring with State officials to defraud the State in the erection and furnishing of the Capitol.\\" The Superintendent of Public Ground and Buildings James Shumaker and Auditor General William P. Snyder were also convicted. Among the convicted, John H. Sanderson and William L. Mathues died before going to prison. = Brunner plan = alt=A city located on the opposite side of a large river, with a domed building in center of the city. From 1912 to 1917, the state acquired all of the 541 separate properties that comprise the Eighth Ward east of the capitol. The Eighth Ward was situated between the capitol and a set of railroad tracks, then owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Arnold Brunner was hired in 1916 to develop new accommodations for state government, which had already outgrown the capitol. He introduced his plan in 1920, which called, first, for the demolition of the Eighth Ward. Brunner planned two office buildings behind the capitol, the North and South Office Buildings, and these were separated by a courtyard he named the People's Court. The South Office Building was completed in 1921. The leveling of the Eighth Ward was finished in 1925. Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, elements of his plans were still completed, except for his People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross the railroad tracks and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13th Street. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, on the west side of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931. = Restoration and preservation = The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission erected two historical markers on August 11, 1953--one commemorating the Hills Capitol and another for the current capitol. The capitol was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 1977. Beginning in 1981, highly regarded historic preservation architect, Hyman Myers, of the Philadelphia architecture firm, Vitetta Group, oversaw the restoration of the capital building. In 1982, the Capitol Preservation Committee (CPC) was created \\"to supervise and coordinate the historic preservation of the State Capitol Building\\". One of the CPC's first projects was the preservation of the 390 Civil War flags and 22 flags from the Spanish-American War, which had been undisturbed since being placed in the rotunda in 1914. Between 1985 and 1987, scaffolding was erected in the rotunda and the murals removed for restoration. The statue atop the capitol dome was removed for restoration via helicopter in the summer of 1998, being returned in September of the same year. It was decided to restore the Senate Chamber after it was flooded with of water on February 14, 1999. The capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark on September 20, 2006, during its centennial. On February 27, 2013, the boundaries of the designation were revised to encompass the grounds and surrounding buildings.  Exterior  The capitol is long and tall. It is wide at its center wing and its two side wings are . The facade of the capitol is constructed out of granite from Hardwick, Vermont. The dome is topped by the gilded brass statue of Commonwealth by Roland Hinton Perry. Standing tall atop a ball, the statue is the personification of a commonwealth. The dome itself weighs and was architecturally inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Huston designed the large bronze doors at the capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The doors are decorated with scenes from the history of Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important in the construction of the capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of the doors. The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole. The entrance is flanked by two sculptures, entitled Love and Labor: The Unbroken Law and The Burden of Life: The Broken Law. Both were sculpted out of Carrara marble from models created by George Grey Barnard in 1909.  Grounds  The Pennsylvania Capitol Grounds, officially the Capitol Park, comprises and 26.4 square perches (7,187 ft2; 668 m2). The grounds are bounded by North Street on the north, 7th Street on the east, Walnut Street on the south and 3rd Street on the west. Arnold Brunner designed the layout of the grounds, which originally totaled only from the land Harris and Maclay gave to the state. The remaining were added when the state bought the Eighth Ward. A monument, dedicated to the citizens of Pennsylvania who died in the Mexican-American War, was built in 1858. The monument was not placed onto the grounds until 1868 and was moved to the southeast corner of the grounds in 1893, when the Executive, Library and Museum Building was built. In 1896-97, a monument, dedicated to former governor John F. Hartranft, was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull. The monument was unveiled on May 18, 1899, and was placed in front of the capitol. It was moved in 1927 to in front of the Executive, Library and Museum Building. Friends of Penrose in the General Assembly, who had died in 1921, passed legislation for a memorial to Penrose. The monument was dedicated on September 23, 1930, and is located near the corner of North 3rd and Walnut Streets.  Interior  alt=The interior of a rotunda, with three half-moon paintings aare visible and two circle paintings between each. The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement. The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\". The interiors of the rotunda and the dome are inscribed with a quote from William Penn made upon the foundation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: House Chamber The lower house of the bicameral General Assembly, the House of Representatives, has 203 members, elected for a term of 2 years, and presided over by the Speaker of the House. The House Chamber, or Hall of the House, is the largest of the three chambers at wide and long. It is located on the south side of the rotunda. alt=A view of a large, ornately-decorated room with several rows of curved desks, arranged in a semicircle. A large mural is visible on the wall at the far end of the room. The House Chamber was designed with an Italian Renaissance theme. William B. Van Ingen created the fourteen circular, stained-glass windows in the House Chamber, and Abbey painted its five murals. The largest of the murals is situated behind the Speaker's rostrum. Named the Apotheosis of Pennsylvania, it depicts 28 famous Pennsylvanians. Senate Chamber The Senate is the upper house of the state legislature and has 50 members, elected to 4-year terms. The Senate is presided over by the President of the Senate, who is also the Lieutenant Governor. The Senate Chamber, or Hall of the Senate, is the second-largest chamber and was designed with a French Renaissance theme. It is located on the north side of the rotunda, opposite the House. Violet Oakley painted the murals in the Senate Chamber. Ingen also made 10 stained-glass windows for the Senate Chamber. Both the House and Senate Chambers are on the second floor, each with an entrance on the upper third and fourth floors leading to a press and media gallery. Supreme Court Chamber Divine Law mural by Violet Oakley in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's chamber. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the court of last resort in the Commonwealth. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania is one of two intermediate appellate courts in state. The Supreme Court Chamber, officially the Supreme and Superior Court Chamber, is used by both courts and was designed using ancient Greek and Roman themes. It is located on the fourth floor of the capitol, on the east side of the rotunda. The Supreme Court Chamber is the smallest of the three chambers at . Violet Oakley painted the 16 murals in the \\"Supreme Courtroom\\" to depict the history of law. The cycle of 16 panels, painted between 1917 and 1927, begins and ends with Divine Law as its keystone, over the main entrance. Around the room clockwise the murals represent the Law of Nature; Greek, Hebrew, and Christian Revealed Law; Roman Law of Reason; English Common Law; William Penn as Law-Giver; State, National, and International law, and finally, the Spirit of Divine Law. A stained-glass dome, designed by Pennsylvania native Alfred Godwin, is in the center of the ceiling.  Capitol Complex  The Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex includes the buildings owned by Commonwealth, which are controlled by the Pennsylvania Department of General Services, and are centered on the capitol in Harrisburg. The Capitol Complex became a National Historic Landmark in 2013 when the designation was revised to include not just the capitol, but the surrounding building as contributing property--except for the East Wing. The complex and greater area is protected full-time by the Pennsylvania Capitol Police—its dedicated law enforcement agency—as well as the Harrisburg Bureau of Police, which patrols the entire city. The oldest building in the complex is the Executive, Library and Museum Building. Situated next to the Hills Capitol and the Huston Capitol, it was built in 1894. It was designated the Matthew J. Ryan Legislative Office Building on June 14, 1999, in recognition of former Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. The Ryan Office Building is the oldest building in the complex and was originally designed to house the State Library and State Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the Governor's Office and Reception Room. Today it houses the offices of the members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. The seven-story North and South Office Buildings are situated behind the capitol and overlook the East Wing. The South Office Building was renamed the K. Leroy Irvis Office Building on December 20, 2002, in recognition of former Speaker K. Leroy Irvis. The State Museum and State Archives buildings were constructed in 1964. A addition, called the East Wing, was dedicated on December 2, 1987. The East Wing replaced the decades-old parking lot and fulfilled Brunner's plan of a People's Court. It was built partially underground, such that the tallest point on the East Wing barely reaches the first floor of the capitol.

During the mobilization waves of March and August of that year, all peace-time units were deployed to airfields throughout the country and attached to respective commands of Air Force, Naval Air Service and squadrons supporting each of the Polish armies. In the last stages of the air campaign, whole units coordinated all actions in the fight against the invaders. The Polish fighters claimed 134 air victories, including 7 enemy aeroplanes shot down by Polish PZL P.7a fighters, 125 by PZL P.11 fighters of all types (mostly P.11c, several P.11a), and 2 downed by PZL P.11g. In addition, the Polish air forces had a number of PZL.37 Łoś and PZL.23 Karaś bombers, as well as a number of non-combat planes used for reconnaissance, observation, communications, army cooperation and transport. Among the latter were Lublin R-XIII, LWS-3 Mewa, RWD-8, RWD-14 Czapla, PWS-10 and PWS-26.  Command structure  The Polish war-time command structure was based on inter-war structure of the air forces. Apart from two air brigades held in reserve by the Commander in Chief (one of them being the Bomber Brigade, the other - Pursuit Brigade), Polish forces were divided onto the following units: * Air regiment () (Wing or Group) usually 4 squadrons or 8 escadrilles / Flights. * Air squadron () (Squadron) usually 2 escadrilles / Flights. * Air escadrille () (Flight) usually 8 to 12 planes. Each escadrille was given a respective number and a proper name, depending on its main tasks. Hence the escadrilles were divided onto: * Bombing escadrille () * Fighter escadrille () * Observation escadrille () * Reconnaissance escadrille () * Staff escadrille () The second number in the name of each of the fighter squadrons shows part of which air regiment the unit was part of, prior to mobilisation. For example, the III/1 dywizjon myśliwski (composed of 111 eskadra myśliwska and 112 eskadra myśliwska) was part of the 1st Air Regiment located in Warsaw.  Reserve of the Commander in Chief  The strategic reserve of the commander in chief of the Polish Army consisted of two air brigades stationed around Warsaw and additional communications squadrons used for easier handling of orders from the headquarters to respective armies. Altogether, on 1 September 1939 Edward Rydz-Śmigły had 146 combat aeroplanes and 60 non-combat planes at his disposal.

Agriculturally derived fill deposited in adjacent ravines to a depth of 2 meters is found covering stumps from the 17th century. Beaver dams and ponds dot the flood plains as well as several old mill ponds which interrupt the flow. Historically, the navigation of the creek has been limited to shallow-draft vessels with present depth up to one meter augmented by 0.3 to 0.4 meter tide. The tributary continues to shoal as the sea level rises driving Potomac silt more than a kilometer inland. Core drilling in the delta has indicated 15 meters of mollusk-bearing sediment, over peat and sand deposits dating back over 6000 years.Geologic History of Popes Creek, Virginia The taking of oysters is abundantly evident. Aboriginal shell middens were found during archeological excavations, post structure and land preparation for the Visitors’ Center at the site of George Washington’s birthplace.

Early reports of dead fish on June 18, enumerating species involved, estimated hundreds of hogchoker at Muses Beach and hundreds of gizzard shad at Stratford Hall. The highest concentration of the characteristic reddish-brown toxin was located below the mouth of Mattox Creek on July 17. The number of fish killed at Mattox Creek was 296,000 with approximately 56 percent young menhaden, 30 percent white perch, and 12 percent croaker. Other species seen in the kill were gizzard shad, mummichog, white and channel catfish, young American eel, hogchoker, largemouth bass and blue crabs.Algal Bloom in the Potomac River, Aug. 21, 2007  See also  *List of Virginia rivers  Notes  References  * *  External links  *Algal Bloom in the Potomac River, Aug. 21, 2007 *Geologic History of Popes Creek, Virginia Category:Rivers of Virginia Category:Rivers of Westmoreland County, Virginia Category:Tributaries of the Potomac River ","title":"Popes Creek (Virginia)"},{"id":"3562951","text":"Crown glass Crown glass was an early type of window glass. In this process, glass was blown into a \\"crown\\" or hollow globe. This was then transferred from the blowpipe to a punty and then flattened by reheating and spinning out the bowl-shaped piece of glass (bullion) into a flat disk by centrifugal force, up to 5 or 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 metres) in diameter. The glass was then cut to the size required. The thinnest glass was in a band at the edge of the disk, with the glass becoming thicker and more opaque toward the center. Known as a bullseye, the thicker center area around the pontil mark was used for less expensive windows. In order to fill large window spaces with the best glass, many small diamond shapes would be cut from the edge of the disk and these would be mounted in a lead lattice work and fitted into the window frame. Crown glass was one of the two most common processes for making window glass until the 19th century. The other was blown plate. Crown glass window panes with ceramic frames have been found at Soba East, the medieval capital of Alodia. They are only in diameter and were probably used to provide light to storerooms.D. Welsby (1992), \\"Windows in Medieval Nubia: The Evidence from Soba East\\", The Antiquaries Journal, 72, 174–178. The process of making crown glass window panes was perfected by French glassmakers in the 1320s, notably around Rouen, and was a trade secret. As a result, crown glass was not made in London until 1678. Crown glass is one of many types of hand-blown glass. Other methods include: broad sheet, blown plate, polished plate and cylinder blown sheet. These methods of manufacture lasted at least until the end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate, machine drawn cylinder sheet, flat drawn sheet, single and twin ground polished plate and float glass.

Typically The Not was a piece of wood, a ruler or a stick, often inscribed with the letters \\"WN\\". This was given to the first pupil to be heard speaking Welsh. When another child was heard using Welsh, The Not was taken from its current holder and given to the latest offender. Whoever was in possession of The Not was encouraged to pass it on to any of their Welsh-speaking classmates by informing the teacher that they had caught someone else speaking Welsh. The pupil in possession at the end of the day was subjected to corporal punishment or other penalty (some reports suggest the punishment was administered at the end of the week, or at the end of each lesson). Language policy Within the Walls of Westminster, the removal of the language was widely discussed, this is evident in the published 'Parliamentary Papers - Volume 16' [1844], which reads; 'as far as your experience goes, there is a general desire for education, and the parents are desirous that their children should learn the English language?--Beyond anything.' and later reading mentions: 'There is the greatest anxiety to catch one another speaking Welsh, and there is a cry out immediately, \\"Welsh not.\\"' Parliamentary Papers - Volume 16, p102. Effects The effect of The Not was to stigmatise the use of the Welsh language among children, and engender the idea that English, as the preferable medium of instruction, was the language of moral progress and opportunity. The practice and wider social changes of the nineteenth and the beginning of the 20th century saw many Welsh speakers come to view the speaking of Welsh as a disadvantage. History=Origin The use of \\"The Not\\" was recorded as early as the 18th century, and there is strong evidence of numerous incidents in both Anglican and Nonconformist schools throughout Carmarthen, Ceredigion and Meirionnydd, it was commonly known as the , the 'Welsh stick' or the 'Welsh lead' (if a lump of lead was used).The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2006 Cultural impact The most frequent use of the Welsh Not in schools appears to be in the first decades following the publication of the government's Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales in 1847. The reports noted that schools in Wales were inadequate, with English monoglot teachers and English textbooks in use in areas where the children spoke only Welsh. It concluded that the Welsh as a race were \\"ignorant\\", \\"lazy\\" and \\"immoral\\", and that one of the main causes of this was the continuing use of the \\"evil\\" Welsh language. The Reports had great influence in Wales, becoming known as Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books) among Welsh speakers, and supporting the removal of Welsh as a moral endeavour. In linking the Welsh language with low educational standards and poor morality, the report also highlighted the effective use of the \\"Welsh Not\\" and, while it did not officially endorse its use, it popularised the method as an effective tool for educators throughout Wales. Later use The use of the \\"Welsh Not\\" appears to have decreased with the introduction of compulsory education in the later decades of the 19th century. After the school boards were absorbed by the county councils following the Local Government Act 1888, instruction in Welsh became the norm in primary schools in Welsh-speaking areas. However, incidents of the \\"Welsh Not\\" were still reported.John Davies, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, , p 455 Owen Morgan Edwards describes his experience of the Welsh Not in school in Llanuwchllyn in his book Clych Atgof. Susan Jones, Member of Parliament for Clwyd South, claimed in 2010 that the use of the Welsh Not, including caning as the punishment, persisted in some schools in her constituency until \\"as recently as the 1930s and 1940s\\". Discouragement of use in disabled children As recent as 2000, a few therapists, health visitors & other healthcare staff were advising parents not to speak to their disabled child in Welsh, thinking that speaking two languages would disadvantage them, but this only caused grievances among families.https://archive.org/details/WELSHINTHEHEALTHSERVICETheScopeNatureAndAdequacyOfWelshLanguageProvisionInTheNat/page/n73/mode/2up?q=%22not+to+speak+Welsh%22 See also *Language policy *Symbole *Treachery of the Blue Books Similar policies in other countries *Vergonha (French suppression of regional languages), and specifically le symbole in French schools. *Dialect card , suppression of Ryukyuan languages and dialects of the Tōhoku region in Japan. *Beatings were used in a similar fashion by American Indian boarding schools through the 1960s, perhaps even later. *In Canada, **Beatings were used in a similar fashion by the Canadian Indian residential school system. **Canadian gaelic was suppressed by use of the \\"maide-crochaidh\\" \\"hanging stick\\" *Russification, policies in Imperial Russia and Soviet Union. * The White terror, a Taiwanese policy from 1949 to 1987 that suppressed non-Mandarin languages within Taiwan.

Revolution During the Haitian Revolution Pierrot led a black battalion at the Battle of Vertieres in 1803. During the period of the Haitian Kingdom, Henri Christophe (Henry I) promoted Pierrot to the rank of Lieutenant General in the Army and granted him the hereditary title of Baron and Prince of Hayti. He later became The Grand Marshal of the Empire under Emperor Faustin I. President Pierrot was elected president of Haiti by the Council of State on April 16, 1845, the day after the death of Philippe Guerrier. As President of Haiti, he was intended to be a figurehead for the mulatto ruling class. Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the Dominicans, who were harassing the Haitian troops along the borders. Dominican boats were also making depredations on Haiti's coasts. President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the Dominicans, whom he considered merely as insurgents. Haitians, however, were not inclined to go to war with their neighbors, and were unwilling to support the President's views. Furthermore, Pierrot had displeased the army by conferring military rank on the leaders of the peasants of the Sud department and on many of their followers. In addition, the inhabitants of the towns of this department felt uneasy regarding the tendencies of Pierrot, who had appointed Jean-Jacques Acaau, the former terrorist of Cayes, as Commandant of the Anse-à-Veau Arrondissement. Fearing a peasant revolt, the townsmen decided to divest Pierrot of his office. In consequence, on March 1, 1846, General Jean-Baptiste Riché was proclaimed President of the Republic at Port-au-Prince. On that same day, Pierrot resigned and retired to his plantation called Camp-Louise, where he led a quiet and peaceful life. Death Pierrot died on February 18, 1857. Pierrot's daughter, Marie Louise Amélia Célestine (Princess Pierrot), in 1845 married Lieutenant-General Pierre Nord Alexis, a provincial governor under Emperor Faustin I, who later became Haitian Minister for War from 1867 to 1869 and president of Haiti from 1902 to 1908.

Yamashita graduated from the 10th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1883, ranked 4th out of 27 cadets. His classmates included Katō Sadakichi. His midshipman service was aboard the ironclad warship during its long-distance navigational training voyage to Wellingtion, Valparaíso, Callao and Honolulu in 1886. After his return to Japan, he was assigned to a number of ships in the early navy as gunnery officer, including the ironclad , gunboat (1889), corvettes (1891), (1892) and (1893). During the First Sino-Japanese War, Yamashita served as the chief gunnery officer on the corvette , followed by the cruiser In 1896, Yamashita was sent to the United Kingdom to oversee warship construction and to study then latest designs of the Royal Navy.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 429.

In July 1900, Yamashita was assigned command of Japanese marines during the Boxer Rebellion at Tientsin and, after performing special duty in Hong Kong and Chefoo, he was promoted to captain in 1903. During the Russo-Japanese War, Yamashita served as an operations planner at the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. In particular, he was central to the efforts to locate the Russian Baltic Fleet and to predict its movements through the Tsushima Strait, leadings to the crucial Battle of Tsushima. Following the war, in February 1906, he was assigned command of the cruiser , which proved to be the only time he ever captained a ship. In November of the same year, he became chief- of-staff of the IJN 1st Fleet. As admiral Yamashita was promoted to rear admiral in 1908 and subsequently served as chief-of-staff of the Combined Fleet for October to December, when he as assigned to command the Sasebo Naval District. In March 1909 he returned to the Navy General Staff as chief of the First Bureau (Operations) and in December of the same year became commandant of the Naval Academy. Yamashita was promoted to vice admiral in December 1912. While commanding the Navy Academy, he was known for being honest and strict in temperament, but on holidays he often invited the cadets to the his office and served them with rice. He was also a great matchmaker who arranged for the marriages of 24 of his cadets. Many of the cadets of the Academy during this period went on to play major roles in World War II. Following Japan's entry into World War I, Yamashita served as vice chief of the Navy General Staff until 1915. From 1915 to 1917, he was the Commander in Chief of the Sasebo Naval District. In August 1915, soon after he as transferred to Sasebo, his ten-year old son was stabbed to death by a junior officer. In December 1917, Yamashita was given command of the IJN 1st Fleet. Promoted to admiral on 2 July 1918, Yamashita served as commander of the Combined Fleet from September 1918 until the end of October 1918, shortly before the war's end. Yamashita served as Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff from December 1920 until April 1925.He was outspoken in his opposition to the Washington Naval Treaty and Japan's abandonment of the \\"Eight-eight fleet\\" concept. Although he pledged to abide by government policies, he focused on new technologies (such as aviation and submarine warfare) which were not restricted by the treaty. Yamashita held several honorary and ceremonial posts after 1925 until being placed on the second reserve list in July 1928. He was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system on 10 November 1928,『官報』号外「授爵・叙任及辞令」November 10, 1928and lived in retirement until his death in 1931.

History The firm was founded in 1920 as Shreve & Lamb, a partnership of Richmond Harold (\\"R.H.\\") Shreve, a Canadian from Nova Scotia, and William F. Lamb, from Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—Shreve was the administrator, while Lamb was the designer. The two met while working at Carrère & Hastings, and Shreve & Lamb was initially a Carrère & Hastings firm. In 1924 the pair decided to leave Carrère & Hastings and became an autonomous architectural company. In 1929 Arthur Loomis Harmon, from Chicago, Illinois, U.S., joined Shreve & Lamb, and the firm became Shreve, Lamb & Harmon.Klose, Oliivia. \\"500 Fifth Avenue Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (December 14, 2010) Prior to joining the firm, Harmon's works included battle monuments at Tours, Cantigny and Somme-Py in France, a YMCA in Jerusalem, and the Shelton Hotel in New York, U.S. For the construction of the Empire State Building, the firm's most notable work, Lamb was responsible for the design, while Shreve's planning skills facilitated the completion of the construction in a year. Shreve's planning skills were recognized in New York and he was involved in projects beyond the firm, such as the Slum clearance Committee of New York. Shreve, Lamb & Harmon primary focus was commercial office buildings and their work in this area was described as \\"spare and functional\\" in 2010 by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. However, the firm completed numerous residential projects, such as No. 130 East 57th Street, and this facet of the company's work was mainly conducted in neo-Tudor, as well as other popular historical styles of the 1920s. Shreve, Lamb and Harmon had also employed the future architect behind the original World Trade Center complex, Minoru Yamasaki after he had completed a masters degree in architecture in 1936. Lasting until 1945, this professional relationship was cut short when Yamasaki took a job at Smith, Hinchman &Grylls.; It's not entirely clear when the company went out of business, with 1989 being a likely date.

The book warned of future difficulties, on an interpretation of the population increasing in geometric progression (so as to double every 25 years) while food production increased in an arithmetic progression, which would leave a difference resulting in the want of food and famine, unless birth rates decreased. While it was not the first book on population, Malthus's book fuelled debate about the size of the population in Britain and contributed to the passing of the Census Act 1800. This Act enabled the holding of a national census in England, Wales and Scotland, starting in 1801 and continuing every ten years to the present. The book's 6th edition (1826) was independently cited as a key influence by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in developing the theory of natural selection. A key portion of the book was dedicated to what is now known as the Malthusian Law of Population. The theory claims that growing population rates contribute to a rising supply of labour and inevitably lowers wages. In essence, Malthus feared that continued population growth lends itself to poverty. In 1803, Malthus published, under the same title, a heavily revised second edition of his work.The fourth edition appeared in 1807 in two volumes. See , volume II via Google Books His final version, the 6th edition, was published in 1826. In 1830, 32 years after the first edition, Malthus published a condensed version entitled A Summary View on the Principle of Population, which included responses to criticisms of the larger work.  Overview  Between 1798 and 1826 Malthus published six editions of his famous treatise, updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject. He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. Malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of William Godwin (1756–1836) and of the Marquis de Condorcet (1743–1794). Part of Thomas Malthus's table of population growth in England 1780–1810, from his An Essay on the Principle of Population, 6th edition, 1826 Malthus regarded ideals of future improvement in the lot of humanity with scepticism, considering that throughout history a segment of every human population seemed relegated to poverty. He explained this phenomenon by arguing that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until a relatively large size of population, relative to a more modest supply of primary resources, caused distress: Malthus also saw that societies through history had experienced at one time or another epidemics, famines, or wars: events that masked the fundamental problem of populations overstretching their resource limitations: The rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns; it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex pre-industrial societies. These findings are the basis for neo-Malthusian modern mathematical models of long-term historical dynamics.See, e.g., Peter Turchin 2003; Turchin and Korotayev 2006 ; Peter Turchin et al. 2007; Korotayev et al. 2006.  Proposed solutions  Malthus argued that two types of checks hold population within resource limits: The first, or preventive check to lower birth rates and The second, or positive check to permit higher mortality rates. This second check \\"represses an increase which is already begun\\" but by being \\"confined chiefly, though not perhaps solely, to the lowest orders of society\\". The preventive checks could involve birth control, postponement of marriage, and celibacy while the positive checks could involve hunger, disease and war; .Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii Malthus highlighted the difference between governmentally instituted welfare and privately supported benevolence and proposed a gradual abolition of poor laws which he thought would be accompanied by a mitigation of the circumstances within which people would need relief and by privately supported benevolence supporting those in distress.Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Chapter V, pp 39–45, in Oxford World's Classics reprint. He reasoned that poor relief acted against the longer-term interests of the poor by raising the price of commodities and undermining the independence and resilience of the peasant. In other words, the poor laws tended to \\"create the poor which they maintain.\\"By doing what appears good, we may do harm. Unintended consequences play a major role in economic thought; see the invisible hand and the tragedy of the commons. It offended Malthus that critics claimed he lacked a caring attitude toward the situation of the poor. In the 1798 edition his concern for the poor shows in passages such as the following: In an addition to the 1817 edition he wrote: Some, such as William Farr and Karl Marx, argued that Malthus did not fully recognize the human capacity to increase food supply. On this subject, however, Malthus had written: \\"The main peculiarity which distinguishes man from other animals, in the means of his support, is the power which he possesses of very greatly increasing these means.\\" Quoted in He also commented on the notion that Francis Galton later called eugenics:  On religion  As a Christian and a clergyman, Malthus addressed the question of how an omnipotent and caring God could permit suffering. In the First Edition of his Essay (1798) Malthus reasoned that the constant threat of poverty and starvation served to teach the virtues of hard work and virtuous behaviour. \\"Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state,\\" he wrote, adding further, \\"Evil exists in the world not to create despair, but activity.\\"Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p 158 Similarly, Malthus believed that \\"the infinite variety of nature...is admirably adapted to further the high purpose of the creation and to produce the greatest possible quantity of good.\\" Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population, 1st ed., published anonymously, (St. Paul's Churchyard, London: J. Johnson, 1798), p. 73. Nevertheless, although the threat of poverty could be understood to be a prod to motivate human industry, it was not God's will that man should suffer. Malthus wrote that mankind itself was solely to blame for human suffering:  Demographics, wages, and inflation  Malthus wrote of the relationship between population, real wages, and inflation. When the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes the cost of living (i.e., the cost of food) to go up. Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages: > \\"A circumstance which has, perhaps, more than any other, contributed to > conceal this oscillation from common view, is the difference between the > nominal and real price of labour. It very rarely happens that the nominal > price of labour universally falls; but we well know that it frequently > remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually > rising. This, indeed, will generally be the case, if the increase of > manufactures and commerce be sufficient to employ the new labourers that are > thrown into the market, and to prevent the increased supply from lowering > the money-price. But an increased number of labourers receiving the same > money-wages will necessarily, by their competition, increase the money-price > of corn. This is, in fact, a real fall in the price of labour; and, during > this period, the condition of the lower classes of the community must be > gradually growing worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich > from the real cheapness of labour. Their increasing capitals enable them to > employ a greater number of men; and, as the population had probably suffered > some check from the greater difficulty of supporting a family, the demand > for labour, after a certain period, would be great in proportion to the > supply, and its price would of course rise, if left to find its natural > level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently the condition of the > lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrograde movements, > though the price of labour might never nominally fall.Essay (1798), Chap. > IV. Accessed from http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1945 on 2010-02-13 In later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (e.g., hunger, disease, and war, termed by Malthus \\"positive checks on population\\") would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles. On the other hand, \\"preventive checks\\" to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability.Essay (1826), I:2.

An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint: xxix Chronology.  1st edition  The full title of the first edition of Malthus' essay was \\"An Essay on the Principle of Population, as it affects the Future Improvement of Society with remarks on the Speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and Other Writers.\\" The speculations and other writers are explained below. William Godwin had published his utopian work Enquiry concerning Political Justice in 1793, with later editions in 1796 and 1798. Also, Of Avarice and Profusion (1797). Malthus' remarks on Godwin's work spans chapters 10 through 15 (inclusive) out of nineteen. Godwin responded with Of Population (1820). The Marquis de Condorcet had published his utopian vision of social progress and the perfectibility of man Esquisse d'un Tableau Historique des Progres de l'Espirit Humain (The Future Progress of the Human Mind) in 1794. Malthus' remarks on Condorcet's work spans chapters 8 and 9. Malthus' essay was in response to these utopian visions, as he argued: The \\"other writers\\" included Robert Wallace, Adam Smith, Richard Price, and David Hume. Malthus himself claimed: Chapters 1 and 2 outline Malthus' Principle of Population, and the unequal nature of food supply to population growth. The exponential nature of population growth is today known as the Malthusian growth model. This aspect of Malthus' Principle of Population, together with his assertion that food supply was subject to a linear growth model, would remain unchanged in future editions of his essay. Note that Malthus actually used the terms geometric and arithmetic, respectively. Chapter 3 examines the overrun of the Roman empire by barbarians, due to population pressure. War as a check on population is examined. Chapter 4 examines the current state of populousness of civilized nations (particularly Europe). Malthus criticises David Hume for a \\"probable error\\" in his \\"criteria that he proposes as assisting in an estimate of population.\\" Chapter 5 examines The Poor Laws of Pitt the Younger. Chapter 6 examines the rapid growth of new colonies such as the former Thirteen Colonies of the United States of America. Chapter 7 examines checks on population such as pestilence and famine. Chapter 8 also examines a \\"probable error\\" by Wallace \\"that the difficulty arising from population is at a great distance.\\" Chapters 16 and 17 examine the causes of the wealth of states, including criticisms of Adam Smith and Richard Price. English wealth is compared with Chinese poverty. Chapters 18 and 19 set out a theodicy to explain the problem of evil in terms of natural theology. This views the world as \\"a mighty process for awakening matter\\" in which the Supreme Being acting \\"according to general laws\\" created \\"wants of the body\\" as \\"necessary to create exertion\\" which forms \\"the reasoning faculty\\". In this way, the principle of population would \\"tend rather to promote, than impede the general purpose of Providence.\\" The 1st edition influenced writers of natural theology such as William Paley and Thomas Chalmers.  2nd to 6th editions  Following both widespread praise and criticism of his essay, Malthus revised his arguments and recognized other influences: > In the course of this enquiry I found that much more had been done than I > had been aware of, when I first published the Essay. The poverty and misery > arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, > and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato > and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a > manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, > among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, > and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited > more of the public attention. The 2nd edition, published in 1803 (with Malthus now clearly identified as the author), was entitled \\"An Essay on the Principle of Population; or, a View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an enquiry into our Prospects respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which it occasions.\\" Malthus advised that the 2nd edition \\"may be considered as a new work\\", and the subsequent editions were all minor revisions of the 2nd edition. These were published in 1806, 1807, 1817, and 1826. By far the biggest change was in how the 2nd to 6th editions of the essay were structured, and the most copious and detailed evidence that Malthus presented, more than any previous such book on population. Essentially, for the first time, Malthus examined his own Principle of Population on a region-by-region basis of world population. The essay was organized in four books: * Book I – Of the Checks to Population in the Less Civilized Parts of the World and in Past Times. * Book II – Of the Checks To Population in the Different States of Modern Europe. * Book III – Of the different Systems or Expedients which have been proposed or have prevailed in Society, as They affect the Evils arising from the Principle of Population. * Book IV – Of our future Prospects respecting the Removal or Mitigation of the Evils arising from the Principle of Population. Due in part to the highly influential nature of Malthus' work (see main article Thomas Malthus), this approach is regarded as pivotal in establishing the field of demography and even to him being regarded as its founding father. The following controversial quote appears in the second edition: > A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get > subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the > society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest > portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At > nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be > gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, if he does not work upon the > compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for > him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The > report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous > claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that > before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is > destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the > hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at > not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests > learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all > intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all > guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited > numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already > full. Ecologist Professor Garrett Hardin claims that the preceding passage inspired hostile reactions from many critics. The offending passage of Malthus' essay appeared in the 2nd edition only, as Malthus felt obliged to remove it. From the 2nd edition onwards – in Book IV – Malthus advocated moral restraint as an additional, and voluntary, check on population. This included such measures as sexual abstinence and late marriage. As noted by Professor Robert M. Young, Malthus dropped his chapters on natural theology from the 2nd edition onwards. Also, the essay became less of a personal response to Godwin and Condorcet.  A Summary View  A Summary View on the Principle of Population was published in 1830. The author was identified as Rev. T.R. Malthus, A.M., F.R.S. Malthus wrote A Summary View for those who did not have the leisure to read the full essay and, as he put it, \\"to correct some of the misrepresentations which have gone abroad respecting two or three of the most important points of the Essay\\".Thomas Robert Malthus, George Thomas Bettany, \\"A Summary View on the Principle of Population, p 36\\" A Summary View ends with a defense of the Principle of Population against the charge that it \\"impeaches the goodness of the Deity, and is inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the scriptures\\". Malthus died in 1834 leaving this as his final word on the Principle of Population.  Other works that influenced Malthus  * Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc. (1751) by Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) * Of the Populousness of Ancient Nations (1752) – David Hume (1711–76) * A Dissertation on the Numbers of Mankind in Ancient and Modern Times (1753), Characteristics of the Present State of Great Britain (1758), and Various Prospects of Mankind, Nature and Providence (1761) – Robert Wallace (1697–1771) * An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) – Adam Smith (1723–90) * Essay on the Population of England from the Revolution to Present Time (1780), Evidence for a Future Period in the State of Mankind, with the Means and Duty of Promoting it (1787) – Richard Price (1723–1791).  Reception, criticism, and legacy of Essay = Personalia  Malthus became subject to extreme personal criticism. People who knew nothing about his private life criticised him both for having no children and for having too many. In 1819, Shelley, berating Malthus as a priest, called him \\"a eunuch and a tyrant\\".Percy B. Shelley: \\"A philosophical view of reform.\\" In The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. London: Gordian, 1829. (vol. 7, p. 32) Marx repeated the idea, adding that Malthus had taken the vow of celibacy, and called him \\"superficial\\", \\"a professional plagiarist\\", \\"the agent of the landed aristocracy\\", \\"a paid advocate\\" and \\"the principal enemy of the people\\".

New York: Academic Press. p. 258 In the 20th century an editor of the Everyman edition of Malthus claimed that Malthus had practised population control by begetting eleven girls.Fogarty, Michael P. 1958. Introduction to Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population. Dent, London. vi In fact, Malthus fathered two daughters and one son. Garrett Hardin provides an overview of such personal comments.  Early influence  The position held by Malthus as professor at the Haileybury training college, to his death in 1834, gave his theories some influence over Britain's administration of India.Petersen, William. 1979. Malthus. Heinemann, London. 2nd ed 1999. p 32 According to Peterson, William Pitt the Younger (in office: 1783–1801 and 1804–1806), on reading the work of Malthus, withdrew a Bill he had introduced that called for the extension of Poor Relief. Concerns about Malthus's theory helped promote the idea of a national population census in the UK. Government official John Rickman became instrumental in the carrying out of the first modern British census in 1801, under Pitt's administration. In the 1830s Malthus's writings strongly influenced Whig reforms which overturned Tory paternalism and brought in the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Malthus convinced most economists that even while high fertility might increase the gross output, it tended to reduce output per capita. David Ricardo and Alfred Marshall admired Malthus, and so came under his influence. Early converts to his population theory included William Paley. Despite Malthus's opposition to contraception, his work exercised a strong influence on Francis Place (1771–1854), whose neo-Malthusian movement became the first to advocate contraception. Place published his Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population in 1822.Petersen, William. 1979. Malthus. Heinemann, London. 2nd ed 1999. Chapter 9: Fertility  Early responses in the Malthusian controversy  William Godwin criticized Malthus's criticisms of his own arguments in his book Of Population (1820). Other theoretical and political critiques of Malthus and Malthusian thinking emerged soon after the publication of the first Essay on Population, most notably in the work of Robert Owen, of the essayist William Hazlitt (1807)A Reply to the Essay on Population, by the Rev. T. R. Malthus. For an annotated extract, see: Malthus And The Liberties Of The Poor, 1807 and of the economist Nassau William Senior,Two Lectures on Population, 1829 and moralist William Cobbett. True Law of Population (1845) was by politician Thomas Doubleday, an adherent of Cobbett's views. John Stuart Mill strongly defended the ideas of Malthus in his 1848 work, Principles of Political Economy (Book II, Chapters 11–13). Mill considered the criticisms of Malthus made thus far to have been superficial. The American economist Henry Charles Carey rejected Malthus's argument in his magnum opus of 1858–59, The Principles of Social Science. Carey maintained that the only situation in which the means of subsistence will determine population growth is one in which a given society is not introducing new technologies or not adopting forward-thinking governmental policy, and that population regulated itself in every well-governed society, but its pressure on subsistence characterized the lower stages of civilization.  Marxist opposition  Another strand of opposition to Malthus's ideas started in the middle of the 19th century with the writings of Friedrich Engels (Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy, 1844) and Karl Marx (Capital, 1867). Engels and Marx argued that what Malthus saw as the problem of the pressure of population on the means of production actually represented the pressure of the means of production on population. They thus viewed it in terms of their concept of the reserve army of labour. In other words, the seeming excess of population that Malthus attributed to the seemingly innate disposition of the poor to reproduce beyond their means actually emerged as a product of the very dynamic of capitalist economy. Engels called Malthus's hypothesis \\"the crudest, most barbarous theory that ever existed, a system of despair which struck down all those beautiful phrases about love thy neighbour and world citizenship\\".Engels, Friedrich, \\"Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy\\", original in DEUTSCHFRANZÖSISCHE JAHRBÜCHER, First (and only) Issue, February 1844, reprinted in Meek (1971), (transl. not specified) Engels also predicted that science would solve the problem of an adequate food supply. In the Marxist tradition, Lenin sharply criticized Malthusian theory and its neo- Malthusian version, See V. I. Lenin: \\"The Working Class and NeoMalthusianism\\" in Pravda No. 137, 16 June 1913; see also calling it a \\"reactionary doctrine\\" and \\"an attempt on the part of bourgeois ideologists to exonerate capitalism and to prove the inevitability of privation and misery for the working class under any social system\\". In addition, many Russian philosophers could not easily apply Malthus’ population theory to Russian society in the 1840s. In England, where Malthus lived, population was rapidly increasing but suitable agricultural land was limited. Russia, on the other hand, had extensive land with agricultural potential yet a relatively sparse population. It is possible that this discrepancy between Russian and English realities contributed to the rejection of Malthus’ Essay on the Principle of Population by key Russian thinkers. Another difference which contributed to the confusion and ultimately the rejection of Malthus's argument in Russia was its cultural basis in English capitalism. This political contrast helps explain why it took Russia twenty years to publish a review of the work and fifty years to translate Malthus's Essay.  Later responses  In the 20th century, those who regarded Malthus as a failed prophet of doom included an editor of Nature, John Maddox.Maddox, John 1972. The Doomsday Syndrome: an assault on pessimism. Economist Julian Lincoln Simon has criticised Malthus's conclusions.Simon J.L. 1981. The ultimate resource; and 1992 The ultimate resource II. He notes that despite the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-Malthusians, massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a Malthusian catastrophe. Many factors have been identified as having contributed: general improvements in farming methods (industrial agriculture), mechanization of work (tractors), the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants (Green Revolution), the use of pesticides to control crop pests. Each played a role. Antony Trewavas: \\"Malthus foiled again and again\\", in Nature 418, 668–670 (8 August 2002), retrieved 28 December 2008 The enviro-sceptic Bjørn Lomborg presented data to argue the case that the environment had actually improved,Lomborg, Bjorn. 2001. The Skeptical Environmentalist. Cambridge UP, London. Chapter 5 Food and hunger, pp60–69; and note also Part III: \\"Can human prosperity continue?\\" pp91–160. and that calories produced per day per capita globally went up 23% between 1960 and 2000, despite the doubling of the world population in that period.Graph in Lomborg 2001 p61; data from United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization database http://apps.fao.org/ From the opposite angle, Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, has argued that Malthus was too optimistic, as he failed to recognize any upper limit to the growth of population — only, the geometric increase in human numbers is occasionally slowed down (checked) by the arithmetic increase in agricultural produce, according to Malthus' simple growth model; but some upper limit to population is bound to exist, as the total amount of agricultural land — actual as well as potential — on Earth is finite, Georgescu-Roegen points out. Georgescu-Roegen further argues that the industrialised world's increase in agricultural productivity since Malthus' day has been brought about by a mechanisation that has substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu- Roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Political advisor Jeremy Rifkin and ecological economist Herman Daly, two students of Georgescu-Roegen, have raised similar neo-Malthusian concerns about the long run drawbacks of modern mechanised agriculture. Anthropologist Eric Ross depicts Malthus's work as a rationalization of the social inequities produced by the Industrial Revolution, anti-immigration movements, the eugenics movement and the various international development movements.Ross, Eric B. 1998. The Malthus factor: population, poverty, and politics in capitalist development. Zed Books, London, 1998.  Social theory  Despite use of the term \\"Malthusian catastrophe\\" by detractors such as economist Julian Simon (1932–1998), Malthus himself did not write that mankind faced an inevitable future catastrophe. Rather, he offered an evolutionary social theory of population dynamics as it had acted steadily throughout all previous history.See Elwell (2001) for an extended exposition Eight major points regarding population dynamics appear in the 1798 Essay: # subsistence severely limits population-level # when the means of subsistence increases, population increases # population-pressures stimulate increases in productivity # increases in productivity stimulate further population-growth # because productivity increases cannot maintain the potential rate of population growth, population requires strong checks to keep parity with the carrying-capacity # individual cost/benefit decisions regarding sex, work, and children determine the expansion or contraction of population and production # checks will come into operation as population exceeds subsistence-level # the nature of these checks will have significant effect on the larger sociocultural system—Malthus points specifically to misery, vice, and poverty Malthusian social theory influenced Herbert Spencer's idea of the survival of the fittest,Spencer, Herbert 1864. Principles of Biology, vol. 1, p 444 and the modern ecological-evolutionary social theory of Gerhard Lenski and Marvin Harris.Lenski, Gerhard. Ecological-evolutionary theory: Principles and applications. Routledge, 2015 Malthusian ideas have thus contributed to the canon of socioeconomic theory. The first Director-General of UNESCO, Julian Huxley, wrote of The crowded world in his Evolutionary Humanism (1964), calling for a world population policy. Huxley openly criticised communist and Roman Catholic attitudes to birth control, population control and overpopulation.  Biology  Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace each read and acknowledged the role played by Malthus in the development of their own ideas. Darwin referred to Malthus as \\"that great philosopher\\",Letter to J.D. Hooker, 5 June 1860 and said of his On the Origin of Species: \\"This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied with manifold force to the animal and vegetable kingdoms, for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage\\".Darwin, Charles 1859. On the origin of species by means of natural selection. Murray, London. p. 63 Darwin also wrote: Wallace stated: Ronald Fisher commented sceptically on Malthusianism as a basis for a theory of natural selection. Quoted in: Fisher emphasised the role of fecundity (reproductive rate), rather than assume actual conditions would not reduce future births.Quoted in: John Maynard Smith doubted that famine functioned as the great leveller, as portrayed by Malthus, but he also accepted the basic premises: : Populations cannot increase geometrically forever. Sooner or later, a shortage of resources must bring the increase to a halt.  Later parallels Writers who have presented ideas that have paralleled various of those of Malthus include: Paul R. Ehrlich who has written several books predicting famine as a result of population increase: The Population Bomb (1968); Population, resources, environment: issues in human ecology (1970, with Anne Ehrlich); The end of affluence (1974, with Anne Ehrlich); The population explosion (1990, with Anne Ehrlich). In the late 1960s Ehrlich predicted that hundreds of millions would die from a coming overpopulation-crisis in the 1970s. Other examples of work that has been accused of \\"Malthusianism\\" include the 1972 book The Limits to Growth (published by the Club of Rome) and the Global 2000 report to the then President of the United States Jimmy Carter. Isaac Asimov also produced many essays on topics related to overpopulation. Ecological economist Herman Daly has recognized the influence of Malthus on his own work on steady-state economics. Other scholars have more linked population and economics to a third variable, political change and political violence, and to show how the variables interact. In the early 1980s, Jack Goldstone linked population variables to the English Revolution of 1640–1660 and David Lempert devised a model of demographics, economics, and political change in the multi-ethnic country of Mauritius. Goldstone has since modeled other revolutions by looking at demographics and economics and Lempert has explained Stalin's purges and the Russian Revolution of 1917 in terms of demographic factors that drive political economy. Ted Robert Gurr has also modeled political violence, such as in the Palestinian territories and in Rwanda/Congo (two of the world's regions of most rapidly growing population) using similar variables in several comparative cases. These approaches suggest that political ideology follows demographic forces. Physics professor, Albert Allen Bartlett, has lectured over 1,500 times on \\"Arithmetic, Population, and Energy\\", promoting sustainable living and explaining the mathematics of overpopulation. Malthus is directly referenced by science-fiction author K. Eric Drexler in Engines of Creation (1986): \\"In a sense, opening space will burst our limits to growth, since we know of no end to the universe. Nevertheless, Malthus was essentially right.\\" The Malthusian growth model now bears Malthus's name. The logistic function of Pierre François Verhulst (1804–1849) results in the S-curve. Verhulst developed the logistic growth model favored by so many critics of the Malthusian growth model in 1838 only after reading Malthus's essay.

It is the most active College drama society in the University, staging or producing over 25 drama productions and comedy smokers every year. It is also the only College drama society to run its own international tours. During its lifetime it has been the starting point for many prominent actors and comedians, such as Clive James, Peter Cook and Eric Idle, and more recently Tom Hiddleston, Jonny Sweet and Joe Thomas. The Society celebrated its 60th birthday in 2015. History=The early days Pembroke Players was founded in the Autumn of 1955 in Room F3, next to the chapel bike racks. In addition to theatre, the underlying purpose of the society was to enable students at the then all-male college to meet ladies from across the University, and accordingly the first meeting was attended by 5 Pembroke men and 48 assorted New Hallers, Girtonians and Newnhamites. (This first meeting subsequently culminated in several marriages.) The first theatre production, Ring Round the Moon by Christopher Fry after Jean Anouilh, took place in snow-struck Blinco Grove in February 1956. (College guarantee £50, bill for damage to hall £18.) The history of the society has also been documented in Pembroke In Our Time (2007, Third Millennium Press). Pembroke Players also has many distinguished alumni. Recordings survive from early productions and Smokers in the 1950s and 1960s featuring original material written and performed by, inter alia, Peter Cook, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Germaine Greer, Clive James, and Jonathan Lynn. Pembroke Smokers were also the first meeting place for some of the Monty Python group. Innovation was not limited to the performances either; a poster from a 1970 production features one of the earliest examples of computer generated ascii art in advertising. =Notable Alumni= *Robert Bathurst *Tim Brooke-Taylor *Peter Cook *Germaine Greer *Tom Hiddleston *Eric Idle *Clive James *David Hugh Mellor *Bill Oddie *Bert Parnaby *Michael Rowan- Robinson *John Sulston *Jonny Sweet *Joe Thomas *Yorick Wilks Today Whilst a term's worth of shows constituted one or two productions and involved a dozen or so people back in 1955, 60 years later the story is much different. The society now holds up to 9 theatre and comedy shows per term (in the college's studio theatre), alongside producing up to three shows in other venues across Cambridge. In addition, they produce an annual College Pantomime written and starring freshers, multiple shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and the Pembroke Players Japan Tour. Pembroke Players also hosts a yearly Black Tie Smoker in the tradition of the '50s and '60s Smoking Concerts,From Fringe to Flying Circus: Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy, 1960-1980 Roger Wilmut, p.33 with performances from both college and Footlights regulars, and several less formal smokers throughout the year. Pembroke New Cellars Pembroke New Cellars, the home of the Players, is a small studio theatre situated in the basement of Foundress Court in Pembroke College. It was completed in 1997 and now stages up to 9 shows a term, as well as comedy smokers and poetry events. New Cellars is a 'black box' space, and remains one of the most versatile student theatres in Cambridge. It offers an intimate setting with maximum flexibility for staging plays 'conventionally', in traverse, or in the round; with performers on the same level as the audience or raised on staging blocks; with seats in an L-shape or one three sides of the stage. Once New Cellars was even transformed into a restaurant for a week, complete with tables for the audiences to sit at while they watched the drama unfold around them. The New Cellars seats 70-90 people. International tours=Pembroke Players German Tour (1957 - 1970, 2005) The first Tour of West Germany took place in the summer of 1957, after one of the founders of the Society became the unintended recipient of a letter addressed to the Cambridge Mummers, inviting them to record Hamlet for German radio. Following a little moonlighting the Pembroke Players secured the tour for themselves instead, playing at venues in Bielefeld, Essen, Düsseldorf and Cologne. The tour was recorded in its entirety for Nord West Deustche Rundfunk and was conducted under the auspices of 'Die Bruecke', a spin-off of the British Council. Many other tours have been run since; the most recent being The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde in 2005. However, in recent years, the German Tour has been superseded by the Pembroke Players Japan Tour. Pembroke Players China Tour (2012) In July 2012, Pembroke Players performed a short run of Much Ado About Nothing (directed by Holly Maguire) at the Haidian Theatre, Beijing. The cast and crew were composed entirely of students of Pembroke College. Pembroke Players Japan Tour (2007 - ) The Pembroke Players Japan Tour was conceived by a small group of Pembroke students in 2006 and spun off from the main committee as a separate body. It was launched with a vision of youth exchange via a modern, accessible Shakespeare production and accompanying workshops. The tours build upon Pembroke's long historical links with Japanese institutions. The society has enjoyed the patronage of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation and the GB Sasakawa Foundation since its inception. =PPJT 2007= The inaugural tour of Romeo and Juliet staged five performances in Japan, visiting Tokyo, Wakayama and Kochi. It also held UK performances at the Embassy of Japan and the Barrandov Opera in Needham Market. Press and public reaction was highly favourable.https://www.meitoku-gijuku.ed.jp/news_school/eigogeki070921.htm An edited record of the performance is on YouTube: Romeo & Juliet. =PPJT 2008= The Midsummer Night's Dream tour (directed by James Lewis) expanded in September 2008 under the auspices of the British Council's UK-Japan 2008UK- Japan 2008 Page project, with nine performances at universities across Japan.Cambridge Students Spreading the Bards Words Daily Yomiuri Sep 19th 2008 UK productions were held in King's College Chapel, Cambridge and the Greenwood Theatre, London. The tour was also offered a BBC weblog which it maintained in conjunction with its first Japanese language blog.http://cuppjt.jugem.jp/ It was directed by James Lewis. =PPJT 2009= The Tempest (directed by Oscar Toeman) was the chosen production of the PPJT tour this year, with the company performing in Tokyo, Nagoya and Yokohama. The production, unlike previous years, was a pre-existing show, directed by Oscar Toeman, and which had previously played at the ADC Theatre, Cambridge, receiving critical acclaim and sellout crowds.http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/issue/theatre/the- tempest/#more-2479 The 2009 tour was supported by the Japan-British Society. =PPJT 2010= The fourth tour staged seven performances of Much Ado About Nothing (directed by Alice Malin) at venues in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kochi and Tateshina-Kougen. UK performances took place at Ely Cathedral and Pembroke House in Walworth, along with an October home-run in the Howard Theatre, Downing College, Cambridge. =PPJT 2011= The fifth anniversary tour took a production of Twelfth Night (directed by Chloe Mashiter) to Japan in summer 2011, with a preview performance at Ely Cathedral followed by shows in Yokohama, Yoyogi, Ochanomizu and Kichijoji. The final show at Seikei University on 1 October formed part of the university's 100th anniversary celebrations and was attended by an audience of over 600. Typhoon Roke caused problems for the group with two actors trapped on a bullet train for 11 hours near Nagoya. =PPJT 2012= The sixth tour returned to Japan with a production of Macbeth (directed by Tom Adams), set in Edwardian Britain. The Players spent a week with principle sponsors, Seikei University, along with shows and workshops at Meiji University, Daito Bunka University and two international schools. In addition, the Players performed two sell-out public performances at Nigiwai-za in Yokohama and led workshops at the Kanto Plains Drama Festival. Four pre-tour performances were held at Ely Cathedral and the Round Church in Cambridge, followed by a post-tour home run at the Corpus Playroom. =PPJT 2013= The seventh annual Japan Tour was a gender- reversed production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona (directed by Charlie Risius). The play was performed in Ely Cathedral and the Round Church, Cambridge, before playing to seven venues in Japan. The tour finished with a week-long home run in the Corpus Playoom in October. =PPJT 2014= The eighth inauguration of the Pembroke Players Japan Tour was The Merchant of Venice (directed by Emma Wilkinson) in 2014. =PPJT 2015= The ninth Japan Tour was The Comedy of Errors (directed by Atri Banerjee), and toured in September and October.

The legend has many variations; most involve a man wearing a rabbit costume who attacks people with an axe or hatchet. Most of the stories occur around Colchester Overpass, a Southern Railway overpass spanning Colchester Road near Clifton, Virginia, sometimes referred to as \\"Bunny Man Bridge\\". Versions of the legend vary in the Bunny Man's name, motives, weapons, victims, description of the bunny costume or lack thereof, and sometimes even his possible death. In some accounts, victims' bodies are mutilated, and in some variations, the Bunny Man's ghost or aging spectre is said to come out of his place of death each year on Halloween to commemorate his passing. Origin and history Fairfax County Public Library Historian-Archivist Brian A. Conley extensively researched the Bunny Man legend. He has located two incidents of a man in a rabbit costume threatening people with an axe. The vandalism reports occurred ten days apart in 1970 in Burke, Virginia. The first incident was reported the evening of October 19, 1970, by U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Robert Bennett and his fiancée, who were visiting relatives on Guinea Road in Burke. Around midnight, while returning from a football game, they reportedly parked their car in a field on Guinea Road to \\"visit an Uncle who lived across the street from where the car was parked\\". As they sat in the front seat with the motor running, they noticed something moving outside the rear window. Moments later, the front passenger window was smashed, and there was a white- clad figure standing near the broken window. Bennett turned the car around while the man screamed at them about trespassing, including: \\"You're on private property, and I have your tag number.\\" As they drove down the road, the couple discovered a hatchet on the car floor. When the police requested a description of the man, Bennett insisted he was wearing a white suit with long bunny ears. However, Bennett's fiancée contested their assailant did not have bunny ears on his head, but was wearing a white capirote of some sort. They both remembered seeing his face clearly, but in the darkness, they could not determine his race. The police returned the hatchet to Bennett after examination. Bennett was required to report the incident upon his return to the Air Force Academy. The second reported sighting occurred on the evening of October 29, 1970, when construction security guard Paul Phillips approached a man standing on the porch of an unfinished home, in Kings Park West on Guinea Road. Phillips said the man was wearing a gray, black, and white bunny costume, and was about 20 years old, tall, and weighed about . The man began chopping at a porch post with a long-handled axe, saying: \\"You are trespassing. If you come any closer, I'll chop off your head.\\" The Fairfax County Police opened investigations into both incidents, but both were eventually closed for lack of evidence. In the weeks following the incidents, more than 50 people contacted the police claiming to have seen the \\"Bunny Man\\". Several newspapers, including The Washington Post, reported that the \\"Bunny Man\\" had eaten a man's runaway cat. The articles that mentioned this incident were: *\\"Man in Bunny costume Sought in Fairfax\\" (October 22, 1970) *\\"The 'Rabbit' Reappears\\" (October 31, 1970) *\\"Bunny Man Seen\\" (November 4, 1970) *\\"Bunny Reports Are Multiplying\\" (November 6, 1970) In 1973, Patricia Johnson, a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, submitted a research paper that chronicled precisely 54 variations on the two incidents. Colchester Overpass Colchester Overpass was built in about 1906 near the site of Sangster's Station, a Civil War era railroad station on what was once the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. Because of its association with the legend, the overpass is a popular destination for paranormal enthusiasts (ghost hunters) and curiosity seekers (legend trippers). Interest increases around Halloween, and starting in 2003, local authorities began controlling access to the area during that time. During Halloween 2011, over 200 people, some from as far away as the Pennsylvania–Maryland state line, were turned away during a 14-hour traffic checkpoint into the area.

Spadoro is an American Democratic Party politician who served three terms as Mayor of Edison, New Jersey, and two terms in the New Jersey General Assembly, where he represented the 18th Legislative District. Early life and education George A. Spadoro was born on March 27, 1948, in Jersey City, New Jersey. After moving to Edison, New Jersey he attended J. P. Stevens High School and graduated in 1966. He attended college at the University of Connecticut for 4 years where he served as Chairman of the Student Senate and Vice President of the student government. He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts in 1970. Spadoro then continued on to the University of California Hastings College of Law where he named to the Hastings Law Journal, was elected Student Government President of the Associated Students of Hastings (ASH) and served as an ex officio member of the law school Board of Governors. As ASH president, Spadoro worked to implement a number of programs, such as The Placement Policy Committee, which was designed to aid the director in expanding job placement services for Hastings graduates and other operational difficulties. He also developed and implemented the Judicial Clerkship Committee to assist students in determining the educational and career advantages of a post-graduate Judicial clerkship. At the same time he obtained assistance for this program from individual members of the Hastings Faculty. Another program Spadoro worked to develop and implement was The California Supreme Court Externship Program, which allowed for a carefully selected student to spend a considerable part of a full semester working as a judicial clerk under the auspices of a California Supreme Court judge. George Spadoro graduated University of California Hastings College of Law with a J.D. in 1973.  Political career  Spadoro first ran for public office in 1978, challenging incumbent Democratic Congressman Edward J. Patten in the primary election and receiving 41% of the vote.  Mayor for Edison, NJ  Spadoro was elected mayor of Edison Township in November 1993. His campaign focused on the issues of job creation and tax stabilization, environmental protection and the preservation of open spaces, and open and accessible government. Mayor Spadoro took office on January 1, 1994. He won a second term in 1997, defeating seven challengers. In the landslide victory, Spadoro received 14,081 votes. His nearest competitor, Republican Eileen Germain Teffenhart, received 5,782. Shortly after being sworn in as Mayor, Spadoro had the honor of hosting the visit of President Bill Clinton to Edison on February 16, 1994. The President had come to deliver an address to the American Association of Retired Persons in Edison. On March 23, Spadoro led Edison and the regions response to Edison's most serious disaster—the Texas Eastern gas line explosion and fire at the Durham Woods Apartment Complex. He received national attention and was commended for his emergency response implementations and was also recorded banging on doors to help evacuate apartment residents in the nearby explosion. The explosion resulted in 1,500 residents were evacuated, 100 were residents were left homeless, 60 were injured and one died of a heart attack. After the disaster, he fought to improve pipeline safety conditions and had become a nationally recognized figure for pipeline safety reform nationwide. The mayor cited the township's reverse 911 system, a \\"state-of- the-art\\" emergency communications center, improved public safety equipment, and the civilian emergency response team (ECERT) as examples of measures taken to make the township safer. At the local level, budgets proposed by Mayor Spadoro included a stabilized tax rate for Edison's almost 100,000 residents. His commitment to reduce the tax burden on local residents was also manifested in several major efforts to create a business-friendly environment in Edison, including the establishment of the Edison Economic Development Corporation. Other achievements include the establishment of the Edison Youth Service Corps. The Youth Service Corps features high school-age students who perform a wide range of community service activities in exchange for modest wages and college tuition assistance. Also among George Spadoro's accomplishments as Mayor was the formation of a community-policing program. Under this program, law enforcement officers establish a closer bond with Edison residents and business establishments in an effort to better understand problems in the community and to stop crimes before they actually occur. Community Policing consisted of Edison's first Police Bike Patrol, Civilian Police Academy, and other programs to take a proactive approach to policing. George Spadoro ran for re-election for Mayor in November 1997 and 2001 and was chosen by the people to continue to serve at the helm of the 5th largest municipality in the state. He began his third term on January 1, 2002. The establishment of the Edison Arts Society marked a triumph for the Mayor, as he increased community awareness about the rich arts culture in Edison. The first Arts Summit, held in June 1998, included speaker Robert Pastorelli, an actor who has played 'Eldin' on Murphy Brown, and focused on the importance of the arts in Edison. Following the establishment of the Arts Society, a number of programs including the organization of the Edison Symphony Orchestra and an Annual High School Art Competition, Holiday Dance Extravaganza, Poetry readings, and Outreach Workshops in poetry, drama, and art. In 1999, the Mayor announced the implementation of a new Defibrillator program for Edison. By increasing the number of Defibrillators in town and by training personnel in the use of them, Mayor Spadoro hoped to save lives. The program included training of police, fire, and municipal personnel as well as companies and citizens around Edison. He also introduced a police car take home program, reducing maintenance costs and increasing police visibility in the community. Following the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, Spadoro, along with many other New York municipalities, authorized members of the Edison Police and Fire Department to provide emergency response support at ground zero, the site of the attack. Amongst Spadoro's post 9/11 efforts, he actively had the Edison Police Department work with the joint terrorism task force to help in anti terrorism efforts. Spadoro recognized that Edison, being one of the largest municipalities near New York City, was a target-rich environment, with such potential sites as warehouses, distribution centers, factories and chemical plants. He allocated $500,000/year in Edison's annual budget over five years for more police officers, training for first responders, new equipment to cope with terrorism, and the formation of a police intelligence unit. He participated in the coordinated network of intelligence gathering and emergency responses put together by the State and its counties. Also, among his post 9/11 efforts as mayor, he dealt with an anthrax attack at a city post-office and other safety concerns. On December 9, 2001, Ford had announced their plans to close their assembly plant which was expected to impact 1,700 employees. Spadoro played a role in attempts to prevent the massive layoff when he urged an \\"economic summit\\" with Ford officials, the United Auto Workers and members of McGreevey's administration. His attempts extended further with James McGreevey and their traveling to Michigan to meet with Ford Executives. After the attempts to prevent the factory closing, Spadoro made plans for redevelopment of the land that was anticipated to have a positive impact on the town of Edison . Mayor Spadoro led an initiative to purchase and preserve several parcels of open space important to the environment. Mayor Spadoro also explored the use of the seven miles of Raritan Riverfront, that wind through Edison, for recreational use and possible development. Also along the Raritan, the Mayor was actively pursuing the establishment of ferry service between Edison and lower Manhattan. George Spadoro continued his work with increasing senior citizen services by instilling programs such as one where senior citizens were introduced to the World Wide Web in a relaxed atmosphere at the Edison Senior Center and the creation of the Mr. Fix It service, which consisted of a free handyman service that provided a home safety inspection and common repair jobs. On August 4, 2002, Spadoro made efforts to restore the Thomas Edison Memorial Tower by hiring its first full- time employee who helped restore the tower and its museum. The newly hired employees title was museum director and his job included everything from painting the base of the tower to persuading famous people, such as President Gerald R. Ford and Walter Cronkite, to record their voices on a 1909-cylinder phonograph invented by Edison. During his tenure as Mayor, Spadoro served on the board of directors of Keep Middlesex Moving Inc., an organization dedicated to promoting transportation issues, opportunities, and alternatives in Middlesex County. He was also a member of the Garden State Games and the Environmental Management Hazardous Waste Institution. Seeking a fourth term, he was defeated in the 2005 Democratic mayoral primary by Jun Choi. Reasons cited for Spadoro's loss include a split in the local Democratic party, the loss of union support due to the approval of a Walmart retail store, and a large turnout of first-time Asian voters due to the New Jersey 101.5 radio controversy.  New Jersey State Assemblyman  After being elected in 1987, from 1988 to 1991 (two terms), he represented District 18 in the New Jersey General Assembly. He became Chairman of the State Assembly Transportation Authorities, Telecommunications, and Technology Committee. During his term as chairman, George authored and was responsible for the passage of legislation that opened the door for the use of fiber optics. This legislation was hailed as marking the turning point in New Jersey's emergence as a leader in the telecommunications revolution. One of Spadoro's major accomplishments as Assemblyman was his sponsorship of the New Jersey Bias Crimes Act, which has become the primary vehicle for the prosecution of bias-related crimes in New Jersey. Through his leadership in the State Legislature, he authored and enacted New Jersey's strongest financial disclosure law which won him praise from many grassroots citizen organizations and government reform groups. The Director of New Jersey Common Cause, referred to Spadoro's legislation as \\"a real reform, not just cosmetic reform...a major milestone in reforming the way New Jersey State government operates.\\" During his tenure in the Assembly, George was also a member of the Insurance and Financial Institution Committee, the Veterans Committee, and the Special Committee on College Alcohol Abuse and Hazing in New Jersey.  Edison Councilman  George Spadoro served as an Edison Township Councilman for eight years between 1981 and 1988, serving as Council President from 1987 through 1988. Spadoro demonstrated an unending commitment to open government, the safety and security of Edison residents and senior citizens, and the preservation of the environment. His involvement with the shutting down and cleaning up of the Kin-Buc chemical waste landfill, a superfund site, extended through his political career into his days as Edison Mayor. Among his accomplishments as Councilman, Spadoro created Edison's Senior Citizen Housing Agency and sponsored the unique Senior Citizens' Set Aside Ordinance, which required developers of multiple-unit dwellings to designate 10% of the total number of units for low and moderate income senior citizens. He led the fight to halt the construction of two co-generation incinerators in Edison and voted to save the Dismal Swamp, a 1,240-acre wetland that serves as the largest natural area in northern Middlesex County. In 1988, he organized the Edison Township Waterfront Recreation Area Study to evaluate the merits of recreational development along miles of the raritan river in Edison.  Legal career  Spadoro began his legal career as an associate with a well known and top ranking Wall Street Law Firm, Sullivan & Cromwell. He also spent several years as Assistant General Counsel for a large telecommunications company called Teleprompter Corporation. Later, Spadoro became a senior partner in the law firm Spadoro & Hilson in Woodbridge Township, NJ and was well known and recognized in the Edison community as a leader and citizen activist. On January 1, 2008, Spadoro joined as Senior Member of CSG Law where he counsels senior executives in financing, commercial litigation and strategic planning. His primary areas of practice includes general corporate, commercial and business matters, family-business law, financial matters and mergers and acquisitions. He works with accountants and other tax experts to advise U.S. clients on their domestic legal structures. Spadoro also advises on international matters and has experience negotiating cross-border transactions.  Current life  In addition to maintaining a full-time legal practice, Spadoro now provides expert television commentary on legal matters as well as current state and national political issues through multiple media outlets. His wife is the Founder and CEO of Future Care Inc. His son, Michael Spadoro, works as a Political Director for U.S. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman and was featured in the Insider NJ 2018 Insider 100: Millennials.

In 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) decided to fund a Coastal Resources Management Project (CRMP) in Sri Lanka, to establish integrated management of coastal resources in order to improve their sustainability by addressing the problems of coastal erosion, pollution, unmanaged fishing, over-exploitation of resources and poverty in the coastal areas. The Bar Reef was declared part of a Special Management Area (SAM) composed of the northern part of the Kalpitiya peninsula and the islands in Portugal Bay; all areas where human activity impinges directly on the welfare of the reef ecosystem. The threats to the ecosystem of the Bar Reef were identified as over-exploitation of fish resources (there is an observable decline in the number of fish), unsuitable fishing methods (such as deep purse seining, which damage the coral and deplete fish resources) and pollution from human activities (prawn farms and agriculture).

The case was one of the earliest, most sensational and most well documented cases of vampire hysteria. It was described in the report of Imperial Provisor Frombald, an official of the Austrian administration, who witnessed the staking of Blagojević. Scholars have noted the influence of Blagojević's case upon the development of the image of the modern vampire in Western popular culture. The case Petar Blagojević lived in a village named Kisilova (possibly the modern-day town of Kisiljevo), in the part of Serbia that temporarily passed from Ottoman into Austrian hands after the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718) and was ceded back to the Ottomans with the Treaty of Belgrade (1739) (see Arnold Paole - Background for more details on the historical context). Blagojević died in 1725, and his death was followed by a spate of other sudden deaths (after very short maladies, reportedly of about 24 hours each). Within eight days, nine people perished. On their death- beds, the victims allegedly claimed to have been throttled by Blagojević at night. Furthermore, Blagojević's wife stated that he had visited her and asked her for his opanci (shoes); she then moved to another village for safety reasons. In other legends, it is said that Blagojević came back to his house demanding food from his son and, when the son refused, Blagojević brutally murdered him, probably via biting and drinking his blood. The villagers decided to disinter the body and examine it for signs of vampirism, such as growing hair, beard and nails, and the absence of decomposition. The inhabitants of Kisilova demanded that Kameralprovisor Frombald, along with the local priest, should be present at the procedure as a representative of the administration. Frombald tried to convince them that permission from the Austrian authorities in Belgrade should be sought first. The locals declined because they feared that by the time the permission came, the whole community could be exterminated by the vampire, which they claimed had already happened \\"in Turkish times\\" (i.e. when the village was still in the Ottoman-controlled part of Serbia). They demanded that Frombald himself should immediately permit the procedure or else they would abandon the village to save their lives. Frombald was forced to consent. Together with the Veliko Gradište priest, he viewed the already exhumed body and was astonished to find that the characteristics associated with vampires in local belief were indeed present. The body was undecomposed, the hair and beard were grown, there were \\"new skin and nails\\" (while the old ones had peeled away), and blood could be seen in the mouth. After that, the people, who \\"grew more outraged than distressed\\", proceeded to stake the body through the heart, which caused a great amount of \\"completely fresh\\" blood to flow through the ears and mouth of the corpse. Finally, the body was burned. Frombald concludes his report on the case with the request that, in case these actions were found to be wrong, he should not be blamed for them, as the villagers were \\"beside themselves with fear\\". The authorities apparently did not consider it necessary to take any measures regarding the incident. The report on this event was among the first documented testimonies about vampire beliefs in Eastern Europe. It was published by Wienerisches Diarium, a Viennese newspaper, today known as Die Wiener Zeitung. Along with the report of the very similar Arnold Paole case of 1726-1732, it was widely translated West and North, contributing to the vampire craze of the eighteenth century in Germany, France and England. The strange phenomena or appearances that the Austrian officials witnessed are now known to accompany the natural process of the decomposition of the body.Ruickbie, Leo, 'Vampire Autopsies', Fortean Times, 288 (Special Issue, 2012), 44-8. Commentary In De masticatione mortuorum in tumulis (1725), Michaël Ranft attempted to explain folk beliefs in vampires.Bunson, Vampire Encyclopedia, p. 63. He writes that, in the event of the death of every villager, some other person or people—most likely a person related to the first dead—who saw or touched the corpse, would eventually die either of some disease related to exposure to the corpse or of a frenetic delirium caused by the panic of merely seeing the corpse. These dying people would say that the dead man had appeared to them and tortured them in many ways. The other people in the village would exhume the corpse to see what it had been doing. He gives the following explanation when talking about the case of Petar Blagojević: \\"Kisiljevo revisited\\" Recently, the story has sparked some interest in the village of Kisiljevo among some Serbian journalists. According to Belgrade newspaper Glas javnosti, which cites local official Bogičić, the villagers are unable to identify Blagojević's grave and don't know whether the local family that bears that surname is related to him. One person recalled stories of a certain female vampire by the name of Ruža Vlajna, who was believed to haunt the village in more recent times, in the lifetime of her grandfather. She would make her presence felt by hitting pots hanging from roofs and was seen walking on the surface of the Danube, but it is unknown whether she was ever staked.

Lynton and Lynmouth are separated by a high cliff, making it hard for people and goods to move between them. In the late 1800s, interest arose in building a funicular or cliff lift to join them. The civil engineer George Croydon Marks played a key role in both its design and bringing in financing from his business partner, Sir George Newnes. Local contractor Robert Jones was involved in designing the funicular's innovative braking system and the line's construction and maintenance in the first decades of its operation. In 1887, construction commenced and a year later, an Act of Parliament authorised the Lynmouth & Lynton Lift Company to operate it. The completed railway was opened on Easter Monday 1890; it has been in continuous use since. While early use was largely focused on moving freight, the funicular railway became popular with tourists and it became mostly used for passenger travel. Its flat platforms were converted into passenger carriages in 1947. It is the world's highest and steepest water-powered cliff railway in operation.Smith, Claire. “Landslip closes Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway.” ‘’geplus.co.uk’’, 31 August 2018. History The railway shortly after construction was completed Origins The high cliffs separating Lynton and Lynmouth made travel and economic development in the area difficult. Most goods, including coal, lime, foodstuffs and other essentials, were delivered by sea to Lynmouth and then carried by packhorses and carts up the steep hill to Lynton. The cliffs posed difficulties for the burgeoning tourist industry in the region. Holidaymakers arrived at Lynmouth on paddle steamers from Bristol and Swansea and other ports in the Bristol Channel, from about 1820. Ponies, donkeys and carriages were available for hire, but the steep gradients led to the animals having short working lives. As the 19th century progressed, it was apparent that the cliffs were restricting the transport of goods between the villages and deterring prospective visitors. In 1881, proposals for a tramway or a rail- based lift emerged. The scheme would have used a stationary steam engine at Lynton but was not progressed. In 1885, another proposal was made for a pier and cliff lift. Construction In 1888, an Act of Parliament authorised the formation of the Lynmouth & Lynton Lift Company. It was given the perpetual rights to extract up to 272,760 litres of river water from the Lyn Valley per day.“Proposed 1300 kW hydroelectric scheme - Objection.” ‘’ exmoor- nationalpark.gov.uk’’, 10 November 2014. The water-powered railway was designed by civil engineer George Croydon Marks, who provided the company's engineering expertise. Its construction was financed mainly by his business partner, publisher Sir George Newnes who owned a large residence at Hollerday Hill and who also backed the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway in 1898 and the construction of Lynton Town Hall in 1900. Robert Jones, was appointed the contractor to build the cliff railway; Jones also contributed to the system's design. Construction started in 1887. A cutting was excavated in the limestone cliff to form the trackbed and three bridges were built over it to carry existing cliff paths. Progress relied entirely on manual labour. The railway was completed in February 1890. Jones served as the company's engineer until 1921. Operations The cliff railway opened on Easter Monday, 7 April 1890, and has been in continuous use ever since. It quickly found use in carrying various goods including coal, ice, sand, granite, cement, petrol and paraffin. The cars were horizontal platforms with sprung, demountable passenger carriage bodies on them. An unusual feature is the halt just below Lynton station at North Walk which has road access. Larger freight items, including motor cars, were moved by the railway into the late 1950s.Gussin, Tony. “Classic cars to be carried up Lynmouth Cliff Railway.” ‘’North Deavon Gazette’’, 27 January 2018. During rail replacement operations in winter 2006, the halt was used for access and material storage.Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Magazine, Spring 2007. In June 1995, the upper and lower waiting rooms were given Grade II listed status. On 18 September 2014, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMECHE) recognised the railway as a unique and outstanding example of British engineering as the first public water-powered total-loss funicular railway in the UK.“Lynton and Lynmouth cliff railway receives award.” ‘’Institution of Mechanical Engineers’’, 19 September 2014. In April 2018, the cliff railway was briefly closed for safety checks following a landslip near the middle bridge. The collapse, caused by a combination of heavy rain, freezing conditions, and high winds, deposited debris onto the track; the railway was not operating at the time.“Lynton and Lynmouth cliff railway closed after landslip.” ‘’ITV News’’, 3 April 2018. Technical details Cliff Railway car, showing the braking mechanism The railway has two cars, each carrying up to 40 passengers. They are attached to cables running up and down from each car and passing round pulleys at each end of the incline, an example of a bottom towrope used to balance the weight of the cables. The system originally used single cables, but this was later replaced by double cables, presumably as a safety measure. The cars require no power to operate, and the system has a relatively low carbon footprint. Water is piped over from the West Lyn River through diameter pipes to a storage reservoir at the upper station. Each car has a tank mounted between the wheels. When the descending car arrives at the lower station, its tank is emptied ready for the return journey. Once passengers have loaded at both stations, water is added to the tank in the upper car until it begins to descend, hauling the lower car up the incline. During the descent, the speed is controlled by a driver in each car; they communicate using hand signals to synchronise their efforts. Due to the steepness of the railway, the original carriages incorporated four independent braking systems, the primary system using hydraulically-actuated callipers that directly clamp onto the under-side of the rail heads, secondary friction brakes are provided by steel shoes that press onto the rails; water instead of oil is used as hydraulic fluid, a unique feature of the Lynmouth & Lynton Cliff Railway. The lower platform was fitted with inter-connected hydraulic buffers - the arriving down car would push the water from its pair of buffers through a narrow pipe into the opposite pair, thus setting them for the next descending car. In June 1888, the braking arrangement was jointly patented by Newnes, Jones and Marks. The parallel gauge tracks rise and are long, giving the line a gradient of 1:1.724 (58%). Halfway up the incline is a passing bay where increased separation of the tracks allows the car to pass. The track uses Bullhead rails. Originally the line used larch sleepers bolted to the exposed rock, and in places to blocks of concrete. The wooden sleepers have since been replaced with modern concrete ones.

Carol Park went missing on 17 July 1976, and was never seen alive again by her family. In 1997, her body was discovered by divers in Coniston Water and Gordon Park was arrested on suspicion of murder. Reputedly he said \\"Oh dear\\", after being informed they had found her body. The charges were subsequently dropped, but in 2004 Park was arrested again and found guilty of his wife's murder. The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment and recommended that he should serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole. He was held at Garth prison, Leyland, Preston. In December 2007, he lodged an appeal against his conviction which was dismissed in November 2008. On 25 January 2010, he was found hanged in his cell, and pronounced dead at the scene. The details of the murder are sketchy. Carol was killed by blunt trauma to her face by means of some instrument, alleged in court to have been an ice axe. She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown overboard from a boat on Coniston Water. The body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers. Had it been dropped a few metres further from the shore, it would have sunk to the much deeper bottom and probably never have been discovered. There was a great deal of controversy surrounding the case. Park received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Park from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder. Case history=Carol Park vanishes Prior to her disappearance, according to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted.Lean, Sandra. Page 61. \\"Several of her friends and family who had seen Carol in the week prior to her disappearance had reported her as appearing to be down or depressed. She had spoken to some about tracing her real parents, as she was adopted.\\" On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, that he did not report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time, he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed.Lean, Sandra. Page 61. \\"It was at that point, when Carol failed to return, that he reported her missing through his solicitor, and her family were informed.\\" On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, and that there was no sign of a struggle.Lean, Sandra. Page 61. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it.Lean, Sandra. Page 62. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason.Lean, Sandra. Page 73. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect. Discovery of body and post mortem results On 13 August 1997, amateur divers discovered Carol Park's body, clad only in a nightdress, 75 feet down at the bottom of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed \\"the Lady in the Lake\\" by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her eyes had been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found. Details of Carol's death were revealed in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and it was said that her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑ to 48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial. Gordon Park is arrested, but charges are dropped At the time of the discovery of the body, Gordon and his third wife, Jenny, were on a cycling holiday in France. They heard news of the discovery of the body, and are said to have seen footage of the police searching their house. On 24 August, they arrived home, and Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder at 8.00am the next morning. He was charged with the murder of Carol Park, and remanded in Preston prison. However, after two weeks, his solicitors managed to persuade the court to grant him bail. On 6 January 1998, the charges against Gordon were dropped due to lack of evidence. The Crown Prosecution Service released a statement saying- > After a conference with leading counsel and the police, a decision was > taken, in agreement with all parties, that there was insufficient evidence > for a realistic prospect of conviction. Reportedly he told another inmate that \\"she deserved it\\" as he had discovered his wife being unfaithful. After the charges were dropped, Gordon said that he wished to \\"try to put all this, including the events of 21 years ago, behind me and try to return to my everyday life\\". However, the fact that the charges were dropped angered Carol's brother, Ivor Price, who said that he was disgusted by the way that Carol was portrayed in the proceedings, and talked of how Carol was not \\"someone who [was] cheap or had a string of lovers.\\" Gordon Park's second arrest and trial Gordon was again arrested on 13 January 2004. Police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest followed new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a \\"mysterious stranger or secret lover\\". Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to weight down the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the \\"terrible concealment\\" of the body. Park claimed he and his wife had an open marriage. The court found that Gordon had first put his hands around Carol's neck to strangle her, but that she had struggled. He then grabbed his ice axe, and brought it down with what was described as \\"considerable\\" force on Carol's face, and smashed the front right-hand side of her face, splitting open her head and smashing her teeth. He then did this again - the attack was described as consisting of \\"two big heavy, crushing blows\\" by pathologist Dr. Edwin Tapp. After this, Gordon dumped his wife's body in the lake, and went back to his day-to-day life. During the trial, the prosecution speculated that Gordon had \\"drugged his wife, possibly on or around the 17 July, tied her up and stored her body in a chest freezer before dumping it in Coniston Water\\". Gordon Park's appeal On 6 December 2007, it was reported that Clarion Solicitors, representing Gordon Park, said that they would launch an appeal. In a public statement, they said: > The appeal is based upon fresh evidence that was not available at the > original trial, it is hoped the conviction will be quashed and a retrial > ordered... Upon his conviction, Mr Park's family and friends launched a > campaign to clear his name, claiming there was no single piece of evidence > that pointed indisputably to him. Representing Park in the appeal was solicitor Rob Rode and Simon Bourne-Arton QC. They did not initially reveal what the new evidence was, only that it was not available at the original trial\\" and that it was \\"very strong and significant\\". Cumbria Constabulary released a statement saying: > Detectives from Cumbria Constabulary carried out a full and thorough > investigation and the full facts of the case were presented to the CPS. The > case was then tried by a jury, where Gordon Park was found guilty of the > murder of Carol Park in 1976. In October, campaigners in support of Park said \\"We have in our possession, a signed, witnessed, statement, made this week, by one of the main prosecution witnesses, stating, ‘police officers did put words in my mouth regarding Gordon Park’ and ‘the police told me what to say in court.’\\" Pastor George Harrison, acting as a spokesperson for the campaigners, also claimed that the appeals process was flawed and \\"rendered virtually impossible\\" due to costs. In November 2008, the appeal bid was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. QC Simon Bourne, representing Park, had wanted to call an expert witness to challenge geological evidence used at the trial. Lord Justice Keene said that the new evidence did not raise \\"a reasonable doubt as to the safety of this conviction\\", saying that the geological evidence was only a small element of the \\"strong circumstantial case against the applicant\\". The new evidence presented by geologist Andrew Moncrief concerned the rock found with the body, said to have been from the wall outside the Parks' house. Moncrief argued that the rock was \\"indistinguishable\\" from others in the area, and therefore \\"meaningless\\". Gordon Park's death On 25 January 2010, the morning of Park's 66th birthday, he was found hanged and unconscious in his prison cell in Garth Prison, and pronounced dead at the scene later in the morning. It is believed that a ligature was involved, and that Park inflicted the injuries upon himself. Park had not been assessed for the risk of suicide. His son, Jeremy Park, said that \\"we are all completely devastated and still believe his innocence 100%.\\" Since his death, Carol Park's family has tried to trace her ashes. Review On 26 November 2014, it was confirmed that the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) was examining the verdict and new DNA evidence had come to light.Lady in the Lake killer could be cleared 5 YEARS after he was hanged in prison - Mirror Online Carol Park's niece has accused Gordon Park's family of 'clutching at straws' and has argued: \\"Gordon went to the High Court of Appeal and lost, so what makes them think after all this time they could find any information that could overturn the court’s decision?\\" On 28 October 2018, the CCRC confirmed that they were referring Park's conviction to the court of appeal. The CCRC \\"considers there is a real possibility that the Court will quash the conviction in light of new evidence\\". The CCRC released the following findings: * Evidence undermining the Crown's claim that Park used his mountain climbing axe to murder his wife. * Evidence undermining the testimony of a prison witness. * Park was not a contributor to the DNA found on the rope used to tie up his wife's body. * A rock found in the lake near Mrs Park's remains could not be linked specifically to the rocks found at the Parks' house. Park's appeal began on 5 November 2019 at the Court of Appeal. On 1 May 2020, his appeal was rejected. Case controversy=Support for Park There was much local interest in the matter, as was shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail, when it ran special editions on the case. Park maintained his innocence, and received much support from his family and friends. His children, Jeremy and Rachael, appointed a new legal team in an attempt to find grounds for appeal. Jeremy also set up a website, www.freegordon.com, in a bid to raise awareness and support of the case for Gordon. Notable individuals offering support included Tony Benn, who said that there was considerable doubt about Gordon's conviction, and that he would do all he could to help campaign for his freedom. Benn has been quoted as saying the case is a \\"grave injustice\\". He is one of over 300 people who have signed the \\"Gordon Park is Innocent\\" petition. A year into Park's life sentence, around forty family members and friends held a vigil at Strangeways Prison in a bid to raise awareness of \\"the fact that there is an innocent man in prison\\". Another was held a year later, led by Jenny Park, and a third on the third anniversary of Park's imprisonment. It was due to these vigils, claimed Evangelical Pastor George Harrison, that he was barred from visiting Park once he was transferred to Garth prison, in Lancashire. Other fronts for the campaign included an offer of £5,000 for anyone providing evidence that led to Gordon's freedom. Included in this were planned adverts in the North-West Evening Mail and leaflets to 20,000 homes in the Furness area. However, this was being organised by Harrison, with whom Gordon and his third wife Jennifer stayed during the trial. Jeremy Park wrote to the North-West Evening Mail to confirm that he wanted nothing to do with the reward, and that Harrison had no right to include his name, contact details or email address, or mention the freegordon website, in the adverts. Subsequently, Harrison claimed to have delivered 6,000 booklets and leaflets in the Furness area. Not everyone with a link to the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with \\"a stick or cane\\" and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had \\"no doubt\\" that justice had been done, and added that \\"Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has been said about her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol.\\" Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he \\"knew it was her, and knew who had done it\\", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, he said that he was \\"distressed\\" by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said \\"It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there.\\" She added that \\"It is finally justice for Carol.\\" The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment. Claims of flawed investigation The case was reported to be difficult for the prosecution, with the time between the murder and the trial making it extremely difficult to track potential witnesses. Keith Churchman, a police officer involved in the case, said that \\"the other difficulty was of course the body was taken away from the place where it was killed.\\" However, on top of the difficulties outlined by the police, the freegordon website detailed a number of what Park's supporters claim are holes in the evidence used to convict him. A story about the problems with the evidence was published in the Daily Mail on 12 October 2005, at the request of Jeremy, though it was not written by him. Bob Woffenden, the author, later wrote an article for Inside Time, in December 2006, talking about the trial and its controversies. Another similar article, pointing out holes in the evidence, was published in the Sunday Herald, on 23 July 2006. =Witnesses= The first problem with the evidence is the use of inmate informant evidence, such as that from Michael Wainwright, described as \\"the most disreputable [form of evidence] of all\\", despite the fact that it was one of the key pieces of evidence in the trial. Glen Banks, a man with whom Park had briefly shared a cell and who claimed in court that Park had admitted his guilt to him, was described as \\"highly suggestible\\", frequently changed his story, and also claimed that Park had admitted to killing Carol while sailing to Blackpool. Wainwright, the other informant, was said to be a heavy cannabis smoker and admitted to hearing voices. He claimed that Gordon had said that he went upstairs, found Carol in bed with another man, and killed her in a fit of rage. This seemed unlikely, as the Parks lived in a bungalow, and the supposed lover has never come forward. Park also claimed to have never actually met Wainwright. Joan Young, who was the only first-hand witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming that she had seen someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, it has been said that Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location where Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year. There are three witnesses who provide direct evidence supporting the idea that Park was innocent. The first, a neighbour, claims that they saw Carol at the bottom of her driveway. A second, another neighbour, claims that they saw an unidentified man in a Volkswagen Beetle in the Parks' drive for twenty minutes. The presence of the unidentified car has never been accounted for. Around 6pm that night, another witness, a woman who knew Carol, saw her at Charnock Richard services. She had mentioned to her husband the fact that Carol had not greeted her, describing her as \\"snobby\\". =Other evidence= The rock supposedly found in the lake, said to be taken from the Parks' garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed that if he had found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defence witness, said that there was no evidence that the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all. The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying that he ever found it. Two more issues are addressed in the Sunday Herald article, but not in the Daily Mail article. The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body - the knots on Carol's body were mostly granny knots, of which there was no evidence that Gordon ever used - indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this, and he responded, \\"I do not use granny knots\\". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this. Both articles address the issue of who the killer could alternatively have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention that he was in the Barrow area around the time of the murder, but both of them are careful to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer. No Smoke On 1 May 2007, No Smoke - The Shocking Truth About British Justice, by Sandra Lean, was published by Exposure Publishing. This book features the stories of seven high-profile convicted murderers, including Park, Luke Mitchell and Sion Jenkins. The book claims that the expert testimonies in the Lady in the Lake trial were flawed, that certain evidence was withheld, and that the sensationalist reporting of the press at the time influenced the court by persuading them that Park was the only person who could have killed his wife. Personal life of Gordon Park Park worked as a village primary school teacher, but was retired by the time he was prosecuted for the murder of his first wife, Carol. Park had two children by Carol, Jeremy and Rachael. Gordon and Carol also adopted their niece Vanessa when she was 18 months old after her mother, Christie (who was Carol's sister), was murdered by her boyfriend in 1969, aged 17. This was described as a \\"rare and appalling coincidence\\", but has been picked up on by the case for the defence since the trial. Park remarried twice after Carol was murdered. His second wife was named Catherine, and his third, to whom he remained married until his death, is named Jenny. Park met all of his wives through teaching, Carol was a teacher at Askam Village School when she was killed. When rejecting Park's request for appeal, Lord Justice Keene, Mr Justice Beatson and Mr Justice Macduff noted that both Gordon and Carol had had affairs in the year leading up to Carol's disappearance. Park's interests included sailing and climbing, which was relevant to the case due to the knots used to tie his wife's body. While in prison, Park spent time practising t'ai chi, taking a maths degree and keeping fit. In an exclusive written interview with The Westmorland Gazette nine months into his sentence, Park talked of how he had struggled with prison, saying: \\"They [other inmates] may smoke incessantly, play loud music, the TV or video games, rifle your drawers, steal, lie etc. There is not a lot you can do about it... I watched a guy \\"chasing the dragon\\". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before.\\" He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying \\"If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I would have said so. I did not know then. I do not know now.\\" References * FootnotesExternal links *Freegordon.com , the website established by Park's son to campaign for his father's freedom Category:2005 in England Category:1976 in England Category:Crime in Cumbria Category:Furness Category:Murder in England Category:Murder trials Category:Trials in England Category:2005 in British law Category:1976 murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Lady in the Lake trial"},{"id":"3563216","text":"Costes may refer to: ;People * Arnaud Costes (b. 1973), French rugby union footballer * Dieudonné Costes (1892-1973), French aviator * Jean-Louis Costes (b. 1954), performing as \\"Costes,\\" French noise musician, performance artist, and film actor ;Other * Hôtel Costes, a hotel in Paris, France, noted for its Hôtel Costes lounge music compilation CDs ","title":"Costes"},{"id":"3563230","text":"Ah My Buddha, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Toshinori Sogabe that was serialized in Comic Gum magazine from March 25, 2004 to February 24, 2007. An anime adaptation aired on TV Tokyo's anime satellite channel, AT-X between July and September 2005. A second \\"season\\" of the manga, named: Amaenaideyo!! MS! was serialized from July 25, 2007 to August 22, 2009. A second season of the anime, , aired between January and March 2006 and introduces a new antagonist, the fifteen-year-old girl Kazuki Kazusano, who is actually very affectionate to Ikkou, unlike the other girls. The second season is also more serious and dramatic than the last one, and focuses more on Hinata's unstable powers, Haruka's childhood years and Kazuki's tricks to get her hand on Ikkou's powers. The show was broadcast in Japan with an R-15 rating, which is the Japanese equivalent of a \\"Restricted\\" rating. Media Blasters licensed and released both seasons of the anime in North America under the title Ah My Buddha (a title parody of the popular anime/manga Ah! My Goddess), first as six single bilingual DVD volumes throughout 2009, and then as a six-DVD collection in April 2010. Right Stuf Inc. has since rescued the series for a complete collection release under their Lucky Penny label in 2014. Plot The protagonist of the series is the monk-in-training Ikkou Satonaka, who transforms into a super-monk with the ability to perform mass exorcisms for the girls he lives with (Note: In the anime, he transforms from seeing a naked girl). He lives in the Saienji Temple as a Buddhist priest in training with six other nuns: Haruka Amanogawa, Sumi Ikuina, Hinata and Sakura Sugai, Chitose Nanbu and Yuuko Atouda, each of whom represents one of the bosatsu of the six lower realms of the traditional Buddhist cosmology. Chitose is the main love interest and has a love-hate relationship with Ikkou which is somewhat typical in many other anime, involving numerous misunderstandings, beatings, and angry tirades where the male is clearly at a disadvantage to the female. A side effect of Ikkou using his ultimate power is that immediately afterwards he turns into an even bigger pervert than he normally is. The subject matter of the series is Ikkou's self- destructive power and the powers of the other nuns and their training to control these powers, as well as their (mostly non-romantic) relationships. Characters From left to right: Ikkou, Jotoku, Haruka, Chitose, Hinata, Sumi, Sakura, and Yuuko. ; * : The main character of the series, Ikkou is able to release a powerful but uncontrollable power when confronted with intense lust. He is 16 years old. Each time, in the aftermath of his \\"awakening,\\" he will bear a curse of lust, and will \\"attack\\" Chitose or the other nuns, who respond by running from him and attacking him. In some episodes he is struck by the other characters more than a half dozen times before the midway point of an episode (for instance, in episode one he was hit 21 times in the first five minutes.) Sometimes he brings it on himself, and sometimes he's the victim of misunderstanding. His character is, essentially, the center of slapstick. Ikkou seems not to enjoy his life at the temple (at least at the beginning of the series) and often complains that he is missing out on his youth. He seems not to have chosen the monastic life and resents the work given to him. He is also the least educated on Buddhist doctrine of all the characters in the show, excluding (possibly) those who are part of the laity. Indeed, he does not seem to have good grades in school nor does he seem to participate in any particular club at school, claiming that his duties at the temple prevent him from having enough time. However, while his fellow novices also have chores, they do not seem prevented from taking on school and hobbies. The head nun of Saienji (Jotoku) believes this is because he is lazy. In his defense, he does seem to be hired out for more temple errands than the other nuns, possibly because he is male and therefore stereotypically better suited to manual labor. ; * : Represents the Human Realm, although she has a crush on Ikkou, she constantly denies it. She is 15 years old. Even though she acts nice much of the time, she fails to admit her crush to herself or Ikkou, often harming him when others flirt with him, overall a stereotypical tsundere. She is usually the first to put Ikkou down as low as possible at times as well as beat him with little provocation. She claims to have no hobbies initially, although she enjoys horror films. She is one of the characters in the series that is harassed by Yuuko for her large cup size, perhaps more frequently than the others. In early episodes there is a running gag to the question of where she used to live, one of the clues being that the entire towns businesses (post office, movie rental, clothing store, etc.) is located in one small two story building. ; * : Represents the Asura Realm, she is a tomboy and does not hesitate to join fights in her High School, she is the sole enemy of a High School Gang that has used Ikkou as a hostage. She is 15 years old. She tends to be jealous of girls that have big breasts compared to her own and angry with guys that prefer such girls, for example, when an underwear thief chose to steal underwear of only C-Cup and above, when she obviously is not a person with a C-Cup. She has no romantic attachments, and seems to think that she would need to change her personality to something more \\"girly\\" in order to have a successful romantic relationship with a male. Like most of the others she likes to physically hurt Ikkou on a daily basis, but unlike the others, her relationship with him is more a sibling bond than romance and she does not appear to have a crush on him. ; * : Represents the Devas Realm (Heaven Realm) is the most powerful exorcist of the group. (Excluding times when Ikkou awakened.) She is 17 years old. She flirts with Ikkou on more than one occasion to get a response only to sit back and watch when he gets beaten by the other girls. She has the biggest cup size of all the novice nuns. She seems to take most everything in good humor, and might even come off as a ditz. However, she might be more intelligent than she looks. ; * : Represents the Animal Realm. She is a kind girl who does not mind Ikkou and some times tries to defend him verbally only to fail and let him get beaten up. She is 16 years old. Her kindness extends even to animals, and this seems to be where her spiritual talents lie. In one second-season episode, she is chased by dogs and treated by them with excessive affection, apparently a side effect resulting from her lack of training. She is also sometimes harassed by Yuuko due to her breast size. Also due to her being of the Animal Realm, during a certain time each year she releases a pheromone that draws countless animals to her, though is later able to control this. ; * : Represents the Naraka Realm (Hell Realm), has a little fire-spitting-demon pet by her side at all times that converts to a full sized demon when Hinata cannot suppress her Naraka bosatsu. She is 14 years old. Later in the series, when Ikkou is on the verge of awakening she often commands her demon to burn him, often successfully preventing him from awakening while others times it seems for the hell of it. She is Sakura's younger adopted sister. She appears very calm and rarely speaks. Her hobby is collecting and studying haniwa, and there is an episode in the second season devoted to the Haniwa Research Club which she joins - the school's smallest club. It is also hinted she has feelings for Ikkou, though unknown if it is like a brother or something more. ; * : Represents the Hungry Ghosts Realm, is the sister of Hinata, and has the incredible ability to eat anything without ever feeling satisfied and without changing her appearance. She is 16 years old. Also has some political skills, as she is the president of the student council of the High School the group attends. Her love of politics seems based in a joy of enforcing the rules. She also has her own internet site, \\"Dr. Sakura,\\" where she berates she calls \\"hopeless\\" in what some might consider an attempt to help them - though she obviously gets a good deal of sadistic enjoyment out of ridiculing their complaints. (The anime suggests that she herself might qualify as a \\"hopeless\\" person). She seems to pull Ikkou into doing extra work for her own (or her sister's) convenience, or for the temple. All in all, she is a sadistic character, but she is not without concern for other people, and is especially attached to her younger sister, Hinata. ; * : Head Monk of the Temple that the group resides in, grandmother to Ikkou, and Assistant Principal to the High School that the group attends. She is extremely strict to Ikkou more than anyone, though this is primarily because she believes him to be spoiled and lazy and does not train hard enough to keep himself from awakening. There have been occasions in the early part of the series where she has let an awakening or another infringement of temple policy go by unpunished, but by the end of the second season she seems to think she might have been too lax with him. She is generally firm with the nuns as well as Ikkou, though Ikkou seems to be the one most frequently in a position to be punished. She, like the other characters, strikes Ikkou repeatedly without remorse but she uses her staff. There seems to be some indication that in her youth Jotoku was a beauty (not only she claims this, but all the older monks around her still seem to think of her as attractive). In the brief points where she is portrayed young, we do not see her face, but she has long hair and even seems to be taller (Humans do actually shrink as they get older, the main cause of this is Osteoporosis. Animators often use this to the extreme for comical effect, making characters appear almost Chibi (term) in appearance. It's not unusual to see older characters in flash backs appearing much taller). ; * : The main antagonist of the second season, her purpose is to awaken Ikkou so that she can release her innate and uncontrollable spiritual powers. Even though she has an antagonistic role in the series, in another sense she seems to be on Ikkou's side - that is, she seems to want to enjoy her youth as much as Ikkou does, and in much the same way - with a member of the opposite sex, and is also considered in a love triangle like situation with Ikkou and Chitose's relationship even though her feelings are known while Chitose hides them from even herself. She states that she wants to help him in developing his spiritual powers since they are the same age, although what she seems to consider \\"helping\\" is different from what the protagonists would consider helping. Since Ikkou's powers are dangerous, the nuns of Saienji hope for Ikkou to restrain himself from using his power too much, while Kazuki seems to believe that the very nature of his powers are essentially good and therefore incapable of doing harm. (The last episode of the series confirms that a strong, uncontrolled awakening can be warped into a force for evil, causing riots and the like.) Nonetheless, she does not seem to want to hurt Ikkou, and while her infatuation with him makes her forceful and competitive (even to the point of violence against Chitose), she is very determined and puts in strong effort to realize a goal that ought to be easier than it apparently is which is to be happy with Ikkou. Her catchphrase in Japanese is . ; * : The chief priestess of Saichouji and older sister to Haruka. She has long black hair and is very beautiful and busty. She seems very understanding of Ikkou; her main role in the series is to help train Hinata and, perhaps, help Ikkou to train his spiritual powers. One might also say she uses him to help Hinata, though it does not seem to be without some benefit (or at least not detrimental) to his own spiritual journey. At one point she even indicated that she would not mind if Ikkou left his present temple to work at hers. Like her younger sister she is flirtatious and does not mind if Ikkou thinks anything perverted about her. She is shown in only a few episodes and is a relatively minor character.

He's on his way to his grandmother, as it is his first time travelling to the Saienji temple. The girls welcomes him, and is very excited to have a boy at the temple for the first time. Well, everyone except Yuko. But the next day at the morning, Ikkou goes inside the bathroom when Sumi already is inside... And that makes them think twice about him. The second audio drama is just added as a \\"bonus chapter\\" of Kazuki. Reception T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews's Carlos Ross commends Ah My Buddha girls as being \\"very cute\\" but justifies his comment by criticising the premise of the anime for being \\"barely more clever than anything else in this genre, and in the end, it's simply another lame excuse for a \\"harem\\" to exist\\". Anime News Network's Theorin Martin commends Ah My Buddha for \\"Generally sharp coloring, occasional funny moment\\". But he criticises the anime for its \\"weak English dub, flat writing, insufficient fan service given its focus\\". Mania.com's Chris Beveridge commends the anime by saying, \\"It's a good sexy light hearted comedy with lots of good character designs, a solid sense of pacing and execution and a healthy dose of fun\\".

The Bubbleator was a large, bubble-shaped hydraulic elevator with transparent acrylic glass walls operated from an elevated chair built for the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle. These transparent walls gave the illusion of looking through an actual 'soap bubble' by refracting light to obtain a rainbow-like effect for the riders inside.

T. C. Howard of Synergetics, Inc. designed the Bubbleator and the exhibit. After the fair, the Bubbleator was relocated to the Center House at Seattle Center. By 1984, it had been removed and put in storage to make way for the Seattle Children's Museum. It was sold to a private owner in Des Moines, Washington, who recycled the upper part of the dome into a greenhouse.

Biography \\"Still life with Spanish iris, morning glory, and cherries\\" by Georg Flegel. Flegel was born in Olmütz (Olomouc), Moravia. Around 1580 he moved to Vienna, where he became an assistant to Lucas van Valckenborch I, a painter and draughtsman. Flegel and his employer later moved to Frankfurt, which at the time was an important art-dealing city. As an assistant, he inserted items such as fruit, flowers, and table utensils into Valckenborch's works. He is probably the same person Kramm found in Utrecht as ‘juriaen vlegel, Constschilder.’ in the \\"Protokol\\" of the notary (or real estate agent) Verduyn, noted as \\"Acte van 21 Maart, 1616\\".Biography in Christiaan Kramm's De levens en werken der Hollandsche en Vlaamsche kunstschilders, beeldhouwers, graveurs en bouwmeesters, van den vroegsten tot op onzen tijd., Gebroeders Diederichs, Amsterdam, 1857-1864 If so, then he probably moved there because of the new Utrecht Guild of St. Luke and probably knew other still life painters active there in that period, such as Roelandt Savery (who had made a trip to Tyrol) and Balthasar van der Ast. According to the RKD he was pupil of Lucas van Valckenborch in Linz during the years 1582-1592.Georg Flegel in the RKD In a period of about 30 years (c. 1600–1630), he produced 110 watercolor and oil pictures, mostly still life images which often depicted tables set for meals and covered with food, flowers and the occasional animal. Among his students were his own two sons, Friedrich (1596/1597–1616) and Jacob (probably Leonhard, 1602–1623), as well as the flower artist Jacob Marrel.

The relevant section of the treaty reads: * \\"from thence\\" (Kittanning) \\"a direct Line to the nearest Fork of the west branch of Susquehanna\\" This line was not clearly defined until in a meeting between Indian and Pennsylvania representatives in 1773 at the well-known \\"Canoe Place\\" or upper limit of canoe navigation on the Susquehanna at its confluence with Cush Cushion Creek at present-day Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania.

Conway and his wife were travel agents with offices in Harrow and Muswell Hill. Early years Alan Conway was born Eddie Alan Jablowsky in Whitechapel London in 1934. At the age of 13 he was sent to a borstal for theft. Around this time, he began frequently changing his name and fabricating various personal histories. Among other stories, he told people he was a Polish Jew who had been imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. During the 1980s, Conway left his wife for a male lover, who later died of AIDS. Conway's business soon collapsed and he descended into alcoholism. Kubrick impersonation Conway's impersonations of director Stanley Kubrick occurred during the early 1990s, by which time Kubrick had been withdrawn from public view for about 15 years. Kubrick had also worn a full beard since the late 1960s and Conway was clean-shaven, allowing his impersonation to appear more legitimate. He convinced several figures in the entertainment industry that he was the famed director, promising them both roles in films and exclusive interviews. On occasion, he conned others into paying for meals and drinks, claiming his studio would reimburse them. Frank Rich, a theatre critic for The New York Times, was taken in by Conway's act in Joe Allen's restaurant when he invited Conway and his friends to join him at his table. Rich was so convinced by Conway's act that he later said that he thought Stanley Kubrick was homosexual after meeting Conway. Rich and his journalist friends were excited at the prospect of an exclusive interview with \\"Stanley Kubrick\\", only later discovering that he was, in fact, an impostor after contacting executives at Warner Brothers who were aware of the scam but had been unable to identify the imposter. Kubrick's lawyer was apprised of the scam and, when he informed Kubrick of the impostor, Kubrick was said to be highly amused by the idea. Kubrick's wife, Christiane, was less impressed with it. As she later reflected: \\"It was an absolute nightmare. This strange doppelgänger who was pretending to be Stanley. Can you imagine the horror?\\" Conway was tracked down in part through the efforts of Kubrick's personal assistant Anthony Frewin, who went on to write the screenplay for the film Colour Me Kubrick (2005) based on these incidents, with John Malkovich starring as Conway. Conway died in December 1998 of a heart attack three months before Kubrick's death, also from a heart attack, in March 1999.

Airbats, known in Japan as , is a manga by Shimizu Toshimitsu which was later adapted into a seven episode anime series, produced by Studio Fantasia and Victor Entertainment. The series was released in Japan on LaserDisc as a series of OVA episodes between 1994 and 1996, and was licensed for English language distribution by ADV Films. The title has been out of print since 2005. The series had aired on TVB in Hong Kong on April 9, 1996. Plot The plot focuses on the activities of Japan Air Self-Defense Force technician Takuya Isurugi, who is transferred to the 801st Tactical Training Squadron, an elite aerobatics team - originally a dumping ground for difficult cases and near-rejects -, at the beginning of the series. Isurugi is a shy otaku who initially makes a bad impression with the four pilots of the unit, all of whom are female. The plot quickly turns into that of a love triangle when two of the pilots, Miyuki Haneda and Arisa Mitaka, fall in love with the surprised Isurugi. This inflames their already-existing rivalry, which causes trouble for their co-operation in the air. With the JASDF already considering disbanding their unit, Isurugi must persuade the girls to work together to improve their performance and save the team. The first three episodes circulate around the love triangle between the pilots and Isurugi, however the remaining four episodes become more typical of an anime series and feature more comical and unusual plots (such as a food eating contest amongst the crew, visiting haunted locales etc.) as well as feature more explicit details behind some of the characters backgrounds. Characters ; :The star of the series, Isurugi is an overly-eager airplane mechanic who loves everything about airplanes. He repairs and works on them for the 801st and joins the team at the start of the series. Isurugi is a very positive and upbeat person; he keeps the team's spirits high and believes anyone who loves airplanes so much can't be a bad person. He first develops a relation with Miyuki which causes jealousy within Mitaka, who even tries to split them apart by spreading rumors about Miyuki. Isurugi still cares for Mitaka however when she develops a fever, and eventually both girls fall in love with him. Isurugi nervously can't decide between the girls and states \\"One will be my girlfriend, the other will be my mistress!\\" Despite being unable to choose, Isurugi still maintains strong friendships with both girls and the others and remains positive and upbeat. :Isurugi Takuya ; :One of the top two pilots in the 801st, Miyuki is considered to be a \\"goody good\\", always being polite, friendly, kind, and not the kind to break the rules or get in trouble. She was placed in the 801st after she struck a superior officer with her hand, though Mitaka talks about the incident rather differently. Miyuki and Mitaka do not get along at all and are polar opposites in terms of personality. Despite their rivalry, however, they manage to work together when the time comes and make an excellent team. Miyuki originally thought Isurugi was a pervert (mostly due to the fact he accidentally saw her undressing). However, she eventually grew to love him and competes for his affection alongside Mitaka. :Haneda Miyuki ; :One of the top two pilots in the 801st, and a constant rival for Miyuki in terms of flight and love. The dusky-skinned Mitaka keeps to herself and is usually more aggressive and hostile to others; she is said to be a troublemaker and is constantly at odds with Miyuki, trying to upset her anyway she can. Mitaka is a top notch pilot and has proven it on many occasions. Mitaka at first did not care for Isurugi, but became slightly jealous when he and Miyuki started dating, so she spread rumors and \\"faked\\" being sick to ruin Miyuki's relationship with Isurugi. However, she wound up falling in love with him as well and fiercely tries to win his affection by constantly competing with Miyuki. She is fiercely competitive, very strong willed, and stubborn. :Mitaka Arisa ; :The captain of the 801st and school rival with Kengamine Kouji. Konishi is an easy going, larger than life man who speaks in very high tones and is almost never seen without his sunglasses. Konishi is very supportive of his team members and works very hard to keep their squad safe from disbandment. When he was younger, Konishi won a ramen- eating contest and was school-mates with Kouji. Before becoming captain, Konishi was secretly in love with Saginomiya Sakura, however so was his best friend, Toshimitsu Tokaji and Sakura was in love with Tokaji. Konishi even proposed to Sakura on the day of her flight exam, but she thought it was Tokaji and said his name which forced Konishi to say Tokaji was in fact, the \\"real\\" person giving her the ring. He is unaware that she secretly returns his affections. :Konishi Mitsuru ; :Sakura is second in command of the team who picks up Isurugi to drop him off at the 801st HQ in the beginning of the first episode. She has an aged dog named Patriot (who she loves very much) and is a compulsive gambler. Sakura gambles on virtually everything from flight exams, food contests, to horse racing, she also happens to be very good at it. Sakura loves karaoke, despite her team mates unusual fear of her singing voice. When Sakura was younger, she became known as one of the top up and coming female pilots and her skills are actually one of the causes for the 801st being formed, which caused tension amongst other female pilots who were jealous of her talent and her stealing the heart of Konishi's best friend, Tokaji. Both Tokaji and Konishi were in love with Sakura but she seemed only interested in Tokaji. On the day of her flight exam, Sakura had been promised by Tokaji he'd be there to see her exam but was distracted by 3 jealous girls. Konishi ran up to Sakura and proposed to her but she expected Tokaji and said his name, forcing Konishi to give her the ring in Tokaji's name. Sakura took the ring and wears it to this day, never knowing until years later Konishi was the one who proposed and though it is never clearly stated, it is implied she has strong feelings for Konishi and seemed to reveal she loved Konishi in return. :Saginomiya Sakura ; :The sweet, short and pink-haired Yoko is used mainly as the comedic character in the series. She is very fond of sweets and junk food, gets rather nasty when she's drunk, and has a pet bat (Chi-chan) who bites people who are either scary or just new to him. Her bat serves as the team's mascot. Yoko is known for having an annoying high voice (in the dub anyway) and is prone to small fits of immaturity and child like behavior. Yoko is the least experienced pilot and is nowhere near as good as Mitaka or Miyuki, as Kengamine Kouji once stated \\"Yoko is the kind of pilot who got her license out of a cereal box.\\" :Shimorenjaku Yoko ; :The thieving, sneaky commander in charge of the 801st division. Kouji makes no mystery hiding the fact he despises being in charge of the 801st; he constantly tries to think up new ways to disband the team or gain a promotion to escape. He thinks the idea of female pilots to be utterly ridiculous and always gets upset when the team continues to surpass exams and tests. Kouji shares a rivalry with Mitsuru Konishi having known him from their training days in the academy. Despite his hatred for the 801st, Kouji defended them when the American flight team (The Thunderbirds) insulted the quality of Japanese pilots, Kouji is very proud to be a Japanese pilot. :Kengamine Kouji ReferencesFurther reading  * External links * Category:1991 manga Category:1994 anime OVAs Category:1997 manga Category:2007 manga Category:ADV Films Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Aviation comics Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Shōnen manga Category:Tokuma Shoten manga Category:Japan Self-Defense Forces in fiction Category:Studio Fantasia Category:Shōnen Gahōsha manga ","title":"801 T.T.S.

She was raised in Brooklyn, New York City. One of her teachers was Abram Chasins. She won the Naumburg Piano Competition in 1943. In 1946, she stood in for Vladimir Horowitz when he was unavailable for a concert, and she asserted that she was the only female pianist ever to have been given this honor. She also appeared with Benny Goodman and his orchestra in a performance of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. In 1949 she married Chasins, who died in 1987. They performed and recorded music for piano duo. Through her husband, who had himself studied with pianist Josef Hofmann, she met other concert pianists, including Vladimir Horowitz. She and Chasins regularly socialized and played bridge with Horowitz and his wife Wanda Toscanini Horowitz during Horowitz's 12-year retirement from the concert stage. As a teen she met Hofmann, Godowsky, and Rachmaninoff; as an adult she and Chasins helped Van Cliburn before his rise to fame. She was close to William Kapell, Abbey Simon, and other pianists. Later in life she often hosted rising young pianists such as Evgeny Kissin and Lang Lang at her Upper West Side home. She later became an accomplished teacher herself. Her pupils included the children of Arthur Rubinstein, who said of her performances of Rachmaninoff's Preludes that he was \\"flabbergasted by the colour, sweep and imagination and ... incredible technique.

The glacier was considered a snow field until a Mazama committeeThe Mazamas committee consisted of Rodney L. Glisan, L. A. Nelson, Earl A. Marshall, Raymond Smith, Fred McNeil, Everett Philpoe, T. Raymond Conway, and Fred W. Stadter. investigated on October 19, 1924 and determined it was, in fact, a glacier and should be named on maps. For some time after that it was known as Salmon River Glacier as it is the headwaters of the Salmon River. Silcox Hut is a small lodge originally built as a warming hut for skiers and climbers, but is now available for group rental for events and rustic overnight accommodation. It is located near the base of the glacier, about vertically up from Timberline Lodge near the upper terminal of the Magic Mile ski lift. The glacier is bounded on the east by a ridge shared with White River Canyon (which contains White River Glacier) and on the west by Zigzag Glacier and Zigzag Canyon, the source of the Zigzag River. The upper glacier narrows to a vertex near the base of Steel Cliff, an area known as Triangle Moraine. Below the glacier, its snowfield varies significantly seasonally, varying in length by almost . Palmer Glacier in mid- autumn During the summer ski season (approximately May through September), the upper half of the Palmer Chairlift terrain is divided into lanes. Lanes nearest the lift are open to the public, while the others are allocated to ski and snowboard camps, ski coaches and other organizations. Between late summer and the first snowfalls of autumn, the glacier is generally unusable for skiing.

It was renamed The Paley Center for Media on June 5, 2007, to encompass emerging broadcasting technologies such as the Internet, mobile video, and podcasting, as well as to expand its role as a neutral setting where media professionals can engage in discussion and debate about the evolving media landscape.\\"The Museum of Television & Radio announces new name\\" Locations With an ever- growing collection of content broadcast on radio and television, the Paley Center has two branches; in New York City and Los Angeles. The New York City branch is in the heart of Midtown Manhattan at 25 West 52nd Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. The Los Angeles branch is located at 465 N Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, near Rodeo Drive. New York The original Museum of Broadcasting, founded in 1975 with a $2 million gift by William S. Paley, opened in Manhattan on November 9, 1976, occupying two floors in an office building at 1 East 53rd Street, near the corner of 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue. This was adjacent to the Doubleday Book Store on Fifth Avenue. The Museum of Broadcasting's name was changed to The Museum of Television & Radio with the September 12, 1991 move into the William S. Paley Building. Designed by Philip Johnson and located at 25 West 52nd Street (adjacent to the famed 21 Club at 21 West 52nd Street), the 16-story building was itself renamed The Paley Center for Media in 2007. It has two front entrances: the one on the left is for office staff, and the main entrance on the right for the general public. The Alexander Mackendrick film Sweet Smell of Success (1957) has an exterior location scene with different angles revealing how the neighborhood looked in the years before the building was constructed. The ground-level floor of the New York museum features the ticket and information area and the Steven Spielberg Gallery, used for exhibitions, receptions and fund-raising events. Reservations to use the Library are made at the front desk. In addition to the elevator, a staircase on the first floor leads down to the large basement-level theater. The fourth floor has numerous computers, used by visitors to locate programming in the collection. When a selection is made, it can be watched on the computer. Computers are available both for individuals and for groups. Los Angeles The Museum of Television & Radio in Los Angeles at 465 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, opened March 18, 1996 in a new building designed by Richard Meier and named for Leonard H. Goldenson. When the Los Angeles building opened, it featured a collection duplicated from the tapes in the New York collection. Rooms were named for the celebrity sponsors: the Danny Thomas Lobby, the Aaron Spelling Reception Area and the Garry Marshall Pool. Screenings were held in the 150-seat John H. Mitchell Theatre. The Ahmanson Radio Listening Room had headphones for use with five pre-programmed channels. In early 2020, the museum at North Beverly Drive closed. The archives moved to the Beverly Hills Public Library and the staff moved to an office in Century City. Archives The Paley Center for Media is committed to the idea that many television and radio programs are significant works and should be preserved for posterity's sake. Instead of collecting artifacts and memorabilia, the Paley Center comprises mostly screening rooms, including two full-sized theaters. Nearly 160,000 television shows, commercials, and radio programs are available in the Paley Center's library, and during each visit, viewers can select and watch shows at individual consoles, and radio programs are accessed through these same consoles. Some television programs are from the 1940s with radio programs dating back to the 1920s. The earliest TV program in the Museum's collection is a silent film of NBC's 1939 production of Dion Boucicault's melodrama The Streets of New York (1857), with Norman Lloyd, George Coulouris, and Jennifer Jones.Ritchie, Michael.

(June 5, 2007) \\"New Name and Mission for Museum of Television\\" The New York Times The Paley Center has acquired many lost episodes of classic television shows and has produced documentary features about the history and impact of television and radio. In recent years, the Center has sponsored advance viewing of the pilot episodes of each network's new programs. The cast and crew of Melissa & Joey at an \\"Onstage @ Paley LA\\" event Television and radio shows are added to the collection after archival discoveries and through donations from individuals and organizations. In 2002, the Museum held a showing of the previously unseen rehearsal film of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella telecast from March 17, 1957. This rehearsal was found in the CBS vault while the Museum was on a quest for other \\"lost\\" Cinderella materials. It had been believed that on the night of the live broadcast the show was preserved on both kinescope and videotape and then transmitted to the West Coast. Seeking either of these, Jane Klain, the Director of Research at the New York facility, asked CBS to search their vaults. The CBS database listed three 16mm films featuring five-minute segments of Julie Andrews performing in the show. When the earliest one was brought from the CBS vault, it was discovered to be the full dress rehearsal. The Center is also known for its many discoveries involving daytime game shows. Episodes of destroyed shows such as High Rollers, Celebrity Sweepstakes, The Money Maze, the Chuck Woolery version of Wheel of Fortune, To Say the Least, and daytime Hollywood Squares episodes are all available for viewing in the library. Episodes of other game shows such as Tattletales, Let's Make a Deal, and The Gong Show are also in the library. Programming and education Seminars and interviews with public figures are conducted frequently, all of which are recorded and available for later viewing on individual consoles. Past seminar participants have included Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Dick Cavett, Alan Alda, Al Franken, John Frankenheimer, James Garner, Bob Hope, Roy Huggins, Jack Paar, Dennis Potter, Dick Van Dyke, and Gore Vidal. Also available for viewing are seminars featuring creators and cast members from TV shows, including The Larry Sanders Show, Seinfeld, King of the Hill, The Simpsons, South Park, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Arrested Development, House, Battlestar Galactica, and The League. Panel discussions have varied from what it was like to work with Orson Welles to a celebration of Roy Huggins's career. PaleyFest, also known as the William S. Paley Television Festival, is an annual television festival hosted by the Paley Center in the Los Angeles area. Founded in 1984, the festival, held annually in the spring, features panels composed of the casts and prominent creative talent from popular television shows such as Community, Parks and Recreation, Mad Men, and Lost, among many others. The panels field questions from a moderator and a public audience and often present exclusive content from their respective series. The festival has been in many venues over its history, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Bing Theater, the Directors Guild of America theater, the Cinerama Dome, and the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills. It was relocated to the larger Dolby Theatre in Hollywood in 2014. Media Advanced Management Program In 2010, The Paley Center for Media announced a partnership with IESE Business School to offer the Advanced Management Program in Media and Entertainment or the \\"Media AMP\\", a postgraduate level program for media and entertainment executives to preparing them for high level leadership roles in their companies. Launched in January 2011, the program’s goal is to bring executives up to speed on new business models, management techniques, and technologies. A key feature is access to leaders in the industry. The Media AMP curriculum covers four modules over a six-month period. Three of the modules are held in New York, and one in Los Angeles. Key discussion topics include: Value Creation; Digital Strategy; Accounting, Finance and Management Control; Content and Customers; Leadership; Production, Technology and Operations Management; Entrepreneurship and Innovation; IT Systems and Strategy; Managerial Economics and Decision Analysis; Marketing Strategy; and others.

The massacre was ordered by Hitler, who directed to kill \\"anything that moves\\" to stop the Warsaw Uprising soon after it began. From 5 to 12 August 1944, tens of thousands of Polish civilians along with captured Home Army resistance fighters were brutally and systematically murdered by the Germans in organised mass executions throughout Wola. Whole families, including babies, children and the elderly, were often shot on the spot, but some were killed after torture and sexual assault. Soldiers murdered patients in hospitals, killing them in their beds, as well as the doctors and nurses caring for them. Dead bodies were piled up to be burned by the Verbrennungskommando (\\"burning detachment\\") to destroy the evidence of the massacre; though first, dogs were let loose to find survivors to be killed. The operation was led by Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, though its main perpetrators were the Dirlewanger Brigade and the \\"RONA\\" Kaminski Brigade, whose forces committed the cruelest atrocities, drawing criticism from Bach- Zelewski himself. The Germans anticipated that these atrocities would crush the insurrectionists' will to fight and put the uprising to a swift end. However, the ruthless pacification of Wola only stiffened Polish resistance, and it took another two months of heavy fighting for the Germans to regain control of the city. Massacre The Warsaw Uprising broke out on 1 August 1944. During the first few days the Polish resistance managed to liberate most of Warsaw on the left bank of the river Vistula (an uprising also broke out in the district of Praga on the right bank but was quickly suppressed by the Germans). Two days after the start of the fighting, SS General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski was placed in command of all German forces in Warsaw. Following direct orders from SS-Reichsfűhrer Heinrich Himmler to suppress the uprising without mercy, his strategy was to include the use of terror tactics against the inhabitants of Warsaw.THE SLAUGHTER IN WOLA at Warsaw Uprising Museum No distinction would be made between insurrectionists and civilians as Himmler's orders explicitly stated that Warsaw was to be completely destroyed and that the civilian population was to be exterminated. Professor Timothy Snyder, of Yale University, wrote that \\"the massacres in Wola had nothing in common with combat ... the ratio of civilian to military dead was more than a thousand to one, even if military casualties on both sides are counted.\\" Polish civilians murdered during the Wola massacre in Warsaw, August 1944 On 5 August, three German battle groups started their advance toward the city centre from the western outskirts of the Wola district, along Wolska and Górczewska streets. The German forces consisted of units from the Wehrmacht and the SS Police Battalions, as well as the mostly Russian SS-Sturmbrigade RONA and the SS- Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger, an infamous Waffen SS penal unit led by Oskar Dirlewanger, which included Aserbaidschanische Legion (part of the Ostlegionen).Rolf Michaelis Die SS-Sturmbrigade „Dirlewanger“. Vom Warschauer Aufstand bis zum Kessel von Halbe. Band II. 1. Auflage. Verlag Rolf Michaelis, 2003, British historian Martin Windrow described Dirlewanger's unit as a \\"terrifying rabble\\" of \\"cut-throats, [foreign] renegades, sadistic morons, and cashiered rejects from other units\\". A column of Polish women with children being led by German troops along Wolska Street in early August 1944 Shortly after their advance toward the centre of Warsaw began, the two lead battle groups — Kampfgruppe \\"Rohr\\" (led by Generalmajor Günter Rohr) and Kampfgruppe \\"Reinefarth\\" (led by Heinz Reinefarth) — were halted by heavy fire from Polish resistance fighters. Unable to proceed forward, some of the German troops began to go from house to house carrying out their orders to shoot all inhabitants. Many civilians were shot on the spot but some were killed after torture and sexual assault. Estimates vary, but Reinefarth himself has estimated that up to 10,000 civilians were killed in the Wola district on 5 August alone, the first day of the operation. Most of the victims were the elderly, women and children. The majority of these atrocities were committed by troops under the command of SS-Oberführer Oskar Dirlewanger and SS- Brigadeführer Bronislav Kaminski. Research historian Martin Gilbert, from the University of Oxford, wrote: > \\"More than fifteen thousand Polish civilians had been murdered by German > troops in Warsaw. At 5:30 that evening [August 5], General Erich von dem > Bach gave the order for the execution of women and children to stop. But the > killing continued of all Polish men who were captured, without anyone > bothering to find out whether they were insurrectionists or not. Nor did > either the Cossacks or the criminals in the Kaminsky and Dirlewanger > brigades pay any attention to von dem Bach Zelewski's order: by rape, > murder, torture and fire, they made their way through the suburbs of Wola > and Ochota, killing in three days of slaughter a further thirty thousand > civilians, including hundreds of patients in each of the hospitals in their > path.\\" Ashes of 4,000 Wola massacre victims murdered at the Franaszek factory buried in a hole in the ground and commemorated by provisional cross On 5 August, the Zośka battalion of the Home Army had managed to liberate the Gęsiówka concentration camp and to take control of the strategically important surrounding area of the former Warsaw Ghetto with the aid of two captured Panther tanks belonging to a unit commanded by Wacław Micuta. Over the next few days of fighting this area became one of the main communication links between Wola and Warsaw's Old Town district, allowing insurrectionists and civilians to gradually withdraw from Wola ahead of the superior German forces that had been deployed against them. On 7 August, the German ground forces were strengthened further. To enhance their effectiveness, the Germans began to use civilians as human shields when approaching positions held by the Polish resistance. These tactics combined with their superior numbers and firepower helped them to fight their way to Bankowy Square in the northern part of Warsaw's city centre and cut the Wola district in half. German units burned down two local hospitals with some of the patients still inside. Hundreds of other patients and personnel were killed by indiscriminate gunfire and grenade attacks or selected and led away for executions. Służba sanitarna w Powstaniu Warszawskim: Wola, SPPW1944 The greatest number of killings took place at the railway embankment on Górczewska Street and two large factories on Wolska Street — the Ursus Factory at Wolska 55 and the Franaszka Factory at Wolska 41/45 — as well as the Pfeiffer Factory at 57/59 Okopowa Street. At each of these four locations, thousands of people were systematically executed in mass shootings, having been previously rounded up in other places and taken there in groups. Between 8 and 23 August the SS formed groups of men from the Wola district into the so-called Verbrennungskommando (\\"burning detachment\\"), who were forced to hide evidence of the massacre by burning the victims' bodies and homes. Most of the men put to work in such groups were later executed. On 12 August, the order was given to stop the indiscriminate killing of Polish civilians in Wola. Erich von dem Bach issued a new directive stating that captured civilians were to be evacuated from the city and deported to concentration camps or to Arbeitslager labour camps. Aftermath The Monument to Victims of the Wola Massacre, displaying a list of execution sites across Wola and estimates of the number of victims at each site A close-up of a detail of the Monument to Victims of the Wola Massacre listing some of the Wolska Street execution sites No one belonging to the German forces who took part in the atrocities committed during the Warsaw Uprising was ever prosecuted for them after the end of the Second World War. The main perpetrators of the Wola massacre and similar massacres in the nearby Ochota district were Heinz Reinefarth and Oskar Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger, who presided over and personally participated in many of the worst acts of violence, was arrested on 1 June 1945 by French occupation troops while hiding under a false name near the town of Altshausen in Upper Swabia. He died on 7 June 1945 in a French prison camp at Altshausen, probably as a result of ill- treatment by his Polish guards.Wistrich, Robert S. (2001). Who's Who of Nazi Germany: Dirlewanger, Oskar. Routledge, p. 44. .Walter Stanoski Winter, Walter Winter, Struan Robertson. Winter Time: Memoirs of a German Sinto who Survived Auschwitz. 2004. Page 139. . In 1945, Reinefarth was taken into custody by the British and American authorities but was never prosecuted for his actions in Warsaw, despite Polish requests for his extradition. After a West German court released him citing a lack of evidence, Reinefarth enjoyed a successful post- war career as a lawyer, becoming the mayor of Westerland, and a member of the Landtag parliament of Schleswig-Holstein. The West German government also gave the former SS-Obergruppenführer a general's pension before he died in 1979. In May 2008, a list of several former SS Dirlewanger members who were still alive was compiled and published by the Warsaw Uprising Museum.Odkryta kartoteka zbrodniarzy, Rzeczpospolita, 17 May 2008.

Whitlock (September 15, 1915 – October 26, 1999) was a British-born motion picture matte artist best known for his work with Disney and Universal Studios. Life and career Whitlock began his film career as a page at Gaumont Studios in London in 1929, before going on to build sets and work as a grip. Trained as a sign painter, he began an intermittent association with Alfred Hitchcock, assisting in the miniature effects for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and then completing all of the signs for The 39 Steps (1935). Whitlock began working as a matte artist during World War II. Recruited by Walt Disney, who admired his work, he relocated to the United States in the early 1950s. At Disney, where the head of the Matte Department was fellow- Londoner and near-exact contemporary Peter Ellenshaw, he successfully mastered the impressionistic approach to matte painting for which he would become known. He remained with the studio for seven years, helping with the design of Disneyland as well as film work, before moving to Universal in 1961. There he served as the head of their matte department, resuming his collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock and many other directors, until retiring from the company in 1985 (though he continued to work on the odd production for a few years afterwards). His most substantial achievement was the creation of over 70 individual matte paintings for the disaster film Earthquake (1974), for which he received an Academy Award. He won the Oscar again the following year for The Hindenburg, in which he re-created the great airship and its final voyage. Universal loaned out Whitlock and his team to other studios for visual effects work on films including Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes, the David Lynch version of Dune, Mame, The Learning Tree and Bound for Glory. In the latter film, Whitlock created the famous Dust Storm with moving cotton- covered disks. One of his last projects was John Carpenter's 1982 sci-fi film The Thing, where he reportedly painted all the shots of the uncovered alien starship, including both distant and close-up viewpoints.http://www.creaturebuzz.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/09/ThingWhitlockBig.jpghttp://thing.popapostle.com/images/episodes/The- Thing-prequel/hatch_1982.JPG However, in 2020, Carpenter claimed that Whitlock had left his assistants in the art department to create the matte paintings, apparently because he disliked Carpenter personally. Carpenter claimed that Whitlock took credit for his assistants' work, and told Carpenter \\"I didn't take a brush to canvas.\\" In addition to his film work, Whitlock worked on the original series of Star Trek contributing matte paintings for several first- season episodes, some of which he reworked for use in later episodes. These have been replaced by CGI replicas in the remastered version of the series. Whitlock was also responsible for the matte paintings in History of the World, Part I, and appeared in the movie as a character hawking used chariots. He also produced background mattes for Brooks earlier film High Anxiety, and appeared in that film in a small role as \\"noted industrialist Arthur Brisbane.\\" Awards=Awards won *1975: Academy Award for Special Achievement in Visual Effects in Earthquake (shared with Frank Brendel, Glen Robinson) *1976: Academy Award for Special Achievement in Visual Effects in The Hindenburg (shared with Glen Robinson) *1985: Emmy for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in A.D. shared with Syd Dutton, Mark Whitlock, Bill Taylor, Dennis Glouner, Lynn Ledgerwood) Awards nominated *1968: Academy Award for Special Effects in Tobruk (shared with Howard A.

Biography  The son of a carpenter, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and did an apprenticeship with the renowned piano manufacturer (1763–1848), whose workshop he took over in 1828. He received the concession for his business by the Vienna city administration on July 28, commonly regarded as the founding date of the Bösendorfer company.

The antonym \\"hypogamy\\" refers to the inverse: marrying a person of lower social class or status (colloquially \\"marrying down\\"). Both terms were coined in the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century while translating classical Hindu law books, which used the Sanskrit terms anuloma and pratiloma, respectively, for the two concepts. The term hypergyny is used to describe the overall practise of women marrying up, since the men would be marrying down.  In India  In rural India, hypergamy is an opportunity to modernize. Marriages in rural India are increasingly examples of hypergamy. Farmers and other rural workers want their daughters to have access to city life, for with metropolitan connections comes internet access, better job opportunities, and upper-class social circles. A connection in an urban area creates a broader social horizon for the bride's family, and young children in the family can be sent to live with the couple in the city for better schooling. Hypergamy comes with a cost though; the dowry, which often costs as much or more than an entire house. The high price that has to be borne by parents to arrange a suitable marriage for a daughter has led to increasing rates of abortion of female fetuses. The concept of marrying up in India is prevalent due to caste- based class stratification. The women from the higher castes were not allowed to marry men from lower castes. This concept of women marrying up, cited in the Smritis as the Anuloma, was justified as the mechanism to keep the Hindu ideological equivalent of the gene pool from degrading. The opposite of the Anuloma, called the Pratiloma, was not allowed in the ancient Indian society. However, the Mahabharata cites examples where exceptions were allowed, as for instance when Devayani, the daughter of Shukracharya, married the Kshatriya Yayati.  Mating preferences  Studies of mate selection in dozens of countries around the world have found men and women report prioritizing different traits when it comes to choosing a mate, with men tending to prefer women who are young and attractive and women tending to prefer men who are rich, well-educated, ambitious, and attractive. Evolutionary psychologists contend this is an inherent sex difference arising out of sexual selection, with men driven to seek women who will give birth to healthy babies and women driven to seek men who will be able to provide the necessary resources for the family's survival. Social learning theorists, however, say women value men with high earning capacity because women's own ability to earn is constrained by their disadvantaged status in a male-dominated society. They argue that as societies shift towards becoming more gender-equal, women's mate selection preferences shift as well. Some research supports that theory, including a 2012 analysis of a survey of 8,953 people in 37 countries, which found that the more gender-equal a country, the likelier male and female respondents were to report seeking the same qualities as each other rather than different ones. However, Townsend (1989) surveyed medical students regarding their perception of how the availability of marriage partners changed as their educational careers advanced. Eighty-five percent of the women indicated that \\"As my status increases, my pool of acceptable partners decreases.\\" In contrast, 90 percent of men felt that \\"As my status increases, my pool of acceptable partners increases.\\" Gilles Saint-Paul (2008) argued that, based on mathematical models, human female hypergamy occurs because women have greater lost mating opportunity costs from monogamous mating (given their slower reproductive rate and limited window of fertility), and thus must be compensated for this cost of marriage. Marriage reduces the overall genetic quality of her offspring by precluding the possibility of impregnation by a genetically higher quality male, albeit without his parental investment. However, this reduction may be compensated by greater levels of parental investment by her genetically lower quality husband.Saint-Paul, G. (2008). Genes, Legitimacy and Hypergamy: Another look at the economics of marriage. Econstor, IZA Discussion Papers, No. 4456. An empirical study examined the mate preferences of subscribers to a computer dating service in Israel that had a highly skewed sex ratio (646 men for 1,000 women). Despite this skewed sex ratio, they found that \\"On education and socioeconomic status, women on average express greater hypergamic selectivity; they prefer mates who are superior to them in these traits... while men express a desire for an analogue of hypergamy based on physical attractiveness; they desire a mate who ranks higher on the physical attractiveness scale than they themselves do.\\" One study did not find a statistical difference in the number of women or men \\"marrying-up\\" in a sample of 1,109 first-time married couples in the United States. Another study has shown that in the UK, hypergamy has decreased significantly since the 1950s. Traditional marriage practices in which men “marry down” in education do not persist for long once women have the educational advantage.  Prevalence  Forms of hypergamy have been practiced throughout history, including in the Indian subcontinent, imperial China, ancient Greece, the Ottoman Empire, and feudal Europe. Today, most people marry their approximate social equals, and in some parts of the world hypergamy has decreased. It is becoming less common for women to marry older men. (Hypergamy does not require the man to be older, only of higher status, and social equals usually refers to social circles rather than economic equality). Though in a 2016 paper that explored the income difference between couples in 1980 and 2012, researcher Yue Qian noted that the tendency for women to marry men with higher incomes than themselves still persists in the modern era.

Earlier he had served as director of ballet for the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. He was also associate director of the American Ballet Theatre from 1984 to 1989, and artistic associate of the Houston Ballet from 1989 to 1992. From a family with no background of ballet or music, MacMillan was determined from an early age to become a dancer. The director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Ninette de Valois, accepted him as a student and then a member of her company. In the late 1940s, MacMillan built a successful career as a dancer, but, plagued by stage fright, he abandoned it while still in his twenties. After this he worked entirely as a choreographer; he created ten full-length ballets and more than fifty one- act pieces. In addition to his work for ballet companies he was active in television, musicals, non-musical drama, and opera. Although he is mainly associated with the Royal Ballet, MacMillan frequently considered himself an outsider there and felt driven to work with other companies throughout his career as choreographer. His creations for the Stuttgart Ballet and the Deutsche Opera ballet include some of his most frequently revived works. Life and career=Early years MacMillan was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, the youngest of four surviving children of William MacMillan (1891–1946), who was a labourer and, from time to time, cook, and his wife, Edith (1888–1942) née Shreeve.Parry, Jann. \\"MacMillan, Sir Kenneth (1929–1992)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2008, retrieved 22 November 2014 His father had served in the army in the First World War, and suffered permanent physical and mental damage. In search of work he moved with his family to his wife's home town, Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. After attending a local primary school, Kenneth studied from 1940 at Great Yarmouth Grammar School, to which he won a scholarship. As Great Yarmouth was a target for German air raids in the Second World War, the school was evacuated to Retford in Nottinghamshire. In Retford, MacMillan was introduced to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately.Parry, pp. 36–39 In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that the feeling of being an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood. When the grammar school returned to Great Yarmouth in 1944 MacMillan found a new ballet teacher, Phyllis Adams. With her help, MacMillan, aged fifteen, secured admission to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School (later the Royal Ballet School). He saw his first performances of ballets, given by Ninette de Valois' Sadler's Wells company, at the New Theatre in London. Dancer Ninette de Valois, who recruited and encouraged the young MacMillan When David Webster was appointed chief executive of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden at the end of the war, his assignment was to establish permanent opera and ballet companies for the house. He set about building the opera company from scratch but persuaded de Valois to make Covent Garden the main base for her ballet company.Haltrecht, pp. 55 and 66–67 In 1946, while still a student, MacMillan appeared in the production of The Sleeping Beauty with which Webster and de Valois reopened the opera house. At first he was a non-dancing extra, and later he was promoted to a small dancing role.Parry, p. 61 With the main company now resident at Covent Garden, de Valois established a smaller ensemble to perform at Sadler's Wells and act as a training ground for young dancers and choreographers. In April 1946 MacMillan was a founder member, and quickly made progress. He was cast by Frederick Ashton, de Valois' principal choreographer, in a leading role in a new ballet, Valses nobles et sentimentales, in October 1946.Thorpe, p. 12 The success of the piece encouraged Ashton to revive his 1933 Les Rendezvous. Although initially only in the corps de ballet for this work, MacMillan was unexpectedly promoted to the male lead because of injuries to all the eligible company principals. His biographer Jann Parry comments that he was able to take over without notice because he had a rare ability to remember and reproduce the steps of every dancer in any piece in which he appeared.Parry, pp. 77–78 He was promoted to the senior Covent Garden company at the start of the 1948–49 season,Parry, p. 81 touring in Europe and dancing Florestan in the third act pas de trois of The Sleeping Beauty in the company's opening gala in New York in October 1949. The first new role he created was The Great Admirer of Mademoiselle Piquant in John Cranko's ballet Children's Corner (1948), followed by both Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty in Margaret Dale's The Great Detective (1953), and Moondog in Cranko's The Lady and the Fool (1954).\\"A guide to Sir Kenneth MacMillan\\", Royal Opera House, retrieved 28 November 2014 Despite his rise within the company, MacMillan became unhappy as a performer. He suffered from severe stage fright, and his leading roles became an ordeal for him. De Valois gave him three months' leave of absence, during which he spent some time dancing with his friend John Cranko's small group in the little Kenton Theatre, away from the spotlight, in Henley-on-Thames.Thorpe, pp. 17–18 Cranko, himself a former dancer who had moved to choreography, concluded that MacMillan might well follow the same course.Parry, p. 113 When MacMillan returned to work, his confidence as a dancer somewhat restored, he took part in de Valois' new Choreographers Group, set up in response to Marie Rambert's \\"Ballet Workshops\\". For this group, MacMillan choreographed his first ballet, Somnambulism, which was first given on 1 February 1953. It was well received, and the next year he followed with another small-scale work, Laiderette. This introduced the \\"outsider\\" character that became a hallmark of his ballets,Simpson, Jane. \\"Kenneth MacMillan: For Better or For Worse?\\", Dance View, 15.4, Summer 1998, pp. 3–5 in this case a female clown who attends a ball at which her host falls in love with her until she loses the mask that has made her attractive.Percival, John. \\"Different Drummer\\", Dance View, 27.1, Winter 2010, pp. 30–32 MacMillan's eclectic choice of music was evidenced in these two early works; the first was danced to jazz composed by Stan Kenton, and the second was to the harpsichord music of Frank Martin.Parry, p. 708 On the strength of the workshop successes, de Valois commissioned the 25-year-old MacMillan to create a ballet for performance at Sadler's Wells. Danses concertantes, to music by Stravinsky, was first produced in January 1955, with designs by Nicholas Georgiadis, with whom MacMillan collaborated extensively over the next years. Parry counts among MacMillan's early influences the modernism of choreographers such as Roland Petit, Jerome Robbins and Antony Tudor, and the craftsmanship of Ashton, from whom MacMillan said he learned how a ballet was made. The Times commented that with this piece it was clear that a powerful choreographic talent had arrived.\\"Sir Kenneth MacMillan\\", The Times, 31 October 1992, p. 15 The critic Clement Crisp has described the piece as \\"a bravura display using a witty, allusive classical vocabulary, remade by a creator who knew the cinema and spoke the movement language of his generation\\".Crisp, Clement. \\"Maker of Dances\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 With the success of Danses concertantes MacMillan concluded that his future lay in choreography rather than dancing. After a fierce argument with de Valois, who wanted him to continue in both capacities, he got his way, and from 1955 his contract with the company (on a slightly reduced salary) was purely as a choreographer.Parry, p. 152 His only Covent Garden appearances as a dancer after that were two performances as an Ugly Step- sister in Cinderella alongside Ashton in 1956.\\"Kenneth MacMillan\\", Royal Opera House performance database, retrieved 28 November 2014 Choreographer MacMillan next produced a series of one-act ballets. For the junior company he choreographed House of Birds (1955), based on the Grimm brothers' Jorinde and Joringel,\\"House of Birds\\" Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 and for Covent Garden he created Noctambules (1956) about a Svengali-like hypnotist.\\"Noctambules\\" Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 He also worked in television, with Punch and the Child (1954), The Dreamers, a television adaptation of Sonambulism, and Turned Out Proud (1955).\\"Turned Out Proud\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 In 1956 he took leave of absence to spend five months in New York, working with American Ballet Theatre, choreographing Winter's Eve and Journey for the dramatic ballerina Nora Kaye. For the Covent Garden opera company he staged the Venusberg ballet in Tannhäuser, regarded by some critics as the best part of a disappointing production.Heyworth, Peter. \\"'Tannhauser' Misproduced\\", The Observer, 27 November 1955, p. 9 ; and \\"Tannhäuser (Venusberg)\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 MacMillan was the first of his generation of choreographers to have an entire evening of his works presented by the Sadler's Wells Ballet.\\"Solitaire\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 In June 1956 his new \\"divertissement ballet\\" Solitaire was given in a quadruple bill with Somnambulism, House of Birds and Danses concertantes.\\"Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet\\", The Times, 8 June 1956, p. 3 His 1958 work, The Burrow, with its menacing echoes of war, oppression and concealment, won praise for venturing into territory seldom explored in ballet. The critic in The Times admitted that its dramatic impact was strong enough \\"to make one glad when it ends\\".\\"The Royal Ballet\\", The Times, 3 January 1958, p. 3 The work marked the beginning of MacMillan's association with Lynn Seymour, who was his muse for many subsequent ballets. The company had by now been granted a royal charter and was known as the Royal Ballet, with the smaller company based at Sadler's Wells called the Royal Ballet Touring Company.\\"Britain's 'Royal Ballet'\\", The Times, 17 January 1957, p. 3 Margot Fonteyn, whose casting as Juliet dismayed MacMillan despite public acclaim In the late 1950s MacMillan choreographed two musicals: one for the stage (The World of Paul Slickey, 1958) and one for the cinema (Expresso Bongo, 1959).Parry, pp. 209 and 211 The Invitation, first shown at the Royal Opera House on 30 December 1960, is probably MacMillan's most controversial ballet. This one-act work about rape was interpreted by Lynn Seymour and Desmond Doyle and provoked, at the time, mixed reactions in the press and the audience.The Royal Opera House Magazine, January 2016, p. 66. Among MacMillan's works for the Royal Ballet in the early 1960s was The Rite of Spring (1962); he selected an unknown junior dancer, Monica Mason, to dance the lead role of the chosen maiden who dances herself to death in a primitive ritual. Dance and Dancers described it as \\"a singular and signal triumph\\"; Mason's performance was judged \\"brilliantly done ... one of British ballet's most memorable performances\\".\\"The Rite of Spring\\", Dance and Dancers, 25 October 1962, p. 16 In The Times John Percival commented that ever since Nijinsky's original attempt in 1913 The Rite had been waiting for a choreographer who could make it work on stage, and MacMillan's was the most successful version to date.Percival, John. \\"A Gala Worthy of the Name\\", The Times, 4 May 1962, p. 20 In the mid-1960s two of his ballets, though both immensely successful, strained relations between MacMillan and the Royal Opera House management. In 1964 Webster and the Covent Garden board turned down MacMillan's proposal to create a ballet using the music of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde The Song of the Earth; the decision was made on the grounds that the score was unsuitable for use as a ballet. Cranko, by now in charge of the Stuttgart Ballet, invited MacMillan to create the work there in 1965. It was a huge success, and within six months the Royal Ballet had taken the piece up.\\"Song of the Earth\\", Royal Opera House archive, retrieved 30 November 2014 MacMillan's first full-length, three-act ballet, Romeo and Juliet (1965), to Prokofiev's score, was choreographed for Seymour and Christopher Gable, but at Webster's insistence the gala premiere was danced by Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.Haltrecht, p. 277 The decision was made for commercial rather than artistic reasons: Fonteyn and Nureyev were internationally known stars and guaranteed a full house at premium prices, as well as huge publicity.Parry, p. 285 In Parry's words, MacMillan and his two chosen dancers felt betrayed. Berlin, 1966–69 Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan accepted an invitation from the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera at the expense of the ballet,Haltrecht, pp. 209–211 MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke. For the Berlin company, MacMillan created seven ballets: Valses nobles et sentimentales, Concerto, Anastasia (one act version), The Sleeping Beauty, Olympiad, Cain and Abel and Swan Lake. The critic Jane Simpson considers that some of MacMillan's finest work was done for Berlin and Stuttgart. Royal Ballet: director 1970–77 In 1970 Ashton, who had been artistic director of the Royal Ballet since de Valois stepped down in 1963, retired, somewhat reluctantly.Parry, p. 341 Webster retired in the same year and wanted a wholesale change of management to coincide with his own departure.Parry, p. 321 For the opera he arranged the joint directorship of Colin Davis and Peter Hall, and for the ballet he secured MacMillan and John Field as co- directors.Haltrecht, p. 301; and \\"Frederick Ashton to Retire\\", The Times, 27 April 1968, p. 1 Neither of the joint directorships succeeded. Hall did not take up his post, instead moving to run the National Theatre,Waymark, Peter. \\"Peter Hall will not take Royal Opera job\\", The Times, 8 July 1971, p. 1 and Field, who had run the junior Royal Ballet company under de Valois and Ashton, found the split directorship untenable and left within months to become director of ballet at La Scala, Milan.\\"John Field\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved 30 November 2014 The Royal Opera House, with statue of Fonteyn MacMillan was in an awkward position. It was widely known that Ashton had been forced out, and many resented it.\\"Biography\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 30 November 2014 Company morale was lowered by an announcement, to which MacMillan and Field were party, that the two ballet companies would merge, with numerous job losses.Percival, John. \\"Royal Ballet reshaping will save £100,000\\", The Times, 10 January 1970, p. 2 The managerial side of the post was no more congenial to MacMillan than it had been in Berlin, and some felt that his creative work suffered during his seven-year term. His expansion of Anastasia into a three-act version (1971) and the other full-length work from this period, Manon (1974), divided opinion, receiving fiercely adverse reviews as well as laudatory ones. His Joplin ballet Elite Syncopations (1974) and Requiem (1976) were immediately successful and have been regularly revived.\\"Elite Syncopations\\" and \\"Requiem\\", Royal Opera House performance database, retrieved 30 November 2014 The latter was dedicated to the memory of Cranko, who had died suddenly in 1973. It was premiered at Stuttgart, because as with Song of the Earth the Royal Opera House board thought the chosen music – Fauré's Requiem – inappropriate for a ballet.Parry, p. 458 The work was not given at Covent Garden until 1983.\\"Requiem\\", Royal Opera House performance database, retrieved 30 November 2014 At the age of 42 MacMillan, hitherto unmarried and enigmatic about his personal life, married the 26-year-old Australian painter Deborah Williams. The writer John Percival comments that MacMillan's marriage \\"saved him, both physically and mentally [and] gave him stability in his private life and seems to have resolved his confused sexuality\\". There was one daughter of the marriage. Royal Ballet: principal choreographer 1977–92 After seven years as director of the Royal Ballet, MacMillan resigned in 1977, wishing to concentrate on choreography. He was succeeded as artistic director by Norman Morrice, whose background was the more avant garde Ballet Rambert.Meisner, Nadine. \\"Norman Morrice: Modernising director of Rambert and the Royal Ballet\\", The Independent, 16 January 2008 MacMillan took up the post of principal choreographer. His fourth full-length ballet, Mayerling (1978), was a dark work, portraying the suicides of the Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf and his young mistress. Parry comments that some scenarios for his new one-act ballets featured similarly dark themes: \\"a disturbed family in My Brother, My Sisters, a lunatic asylum in Playground; Valley of Shadows ... included scenes in a Nazi concentration camp.\\" Different Drummer (1984) was a balletic version of Georg Büchner's Woyzeck, familiar to Covent Garden audiences from Berg's 1925 opera Wozzeck: all three depict the brutal fate of the downtrodden.\\"Different Drummer\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 1 December 2014 Even the lighter of MacMillan's ballets could have their serious side: La fin du jour (1979), to Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, depicts a way of life of the 1930s soon to be shattered by the Second World War, and is described by Crisp as \\"a requiem for the douceur de vivre of an era\\".Crisp, Clement. \\"La Fin du Jour\\", The Financial Times, 16 March 1979, p. 21 In the 1980s MacMillan ventured into non-balletic theatre, directing productions of Strindberg's The Dance of Death (Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, 1983) and Tennessee Williams's Kingdom of Earth (Hampstead Theatre, 1984). Parry, writing in The Observer, thought that the drama in the first play failed to spring fully to life;Parry, Jann. \\"Cosmetics\\", The Observer, 18 September 1983, p. 32 Michael Billington of The Guardian praised MacMillan's \\"immensely detailed, atmospheric production\\" of the second piece.Billington, Michael, \\"Kingdom of Earth\\", The Guardian, 28 April 1984, p. 10 From 1984 to 1989, while remaining chief choreographer of the Royal Ballet, MacMillan was associate director of the American Ballet Theatre. For that company he staged new works, Wild Boy and Requiem (this time to Andrew Lloyd Webber's music rather than Fauré's), restaged his Romeo and Juliet, and created a new production of The Sleeping Beauty. Despite a serious heart attack in 1988 MacMillan continued to work intensely. In 1989 he made his first new ballet for Covent Garden for five years, a new version of Britten's The Prince of the Pagodas. The company had never found the original 1956 Cranko version satisfactory, and it was neglected during the composer's lifetime. MacMillan thought the piece could be successfully reworked with some cuts to the score, but the Britten estate refused to allow any alterations.Parry, p. 664 MacMillan reverted to classical ballet for the piece, creating a fairy-tale work far from his accustomed style. The result was not judged among his best works, but it marked the emergence of the 19-year-old Darcey Bussell, whom he picked to dance the young heroine. Along with the former Bolshoi principal dancer Irek Mukhamedov, who joined the Royal Ballet in 1991, Bussell was MacMillan's final important muse. For the two of them he created Winter Dreams (1991), inspired by Chekhov's Three Sisters. Mukhamedov was the brutish male leading character in MacMillan's last ballet, The Judas Tree (1992).\\"The Judas Tree\\" , Kenneth MacMillan, retrieved 1 December 2014 MacMillan died from a heart attack backstage at the Royal Opera House during a performance of Mayerling. Jeremy Isaacs, the general director of the Royal Opera House, announced the death from the stage after the performance and asked the audience to rise and bow their heads and leave the theatre in silence.Anderson, Jack. \\" Sir Kenneth MacMillan, 62, Choreographer, Dies\\", The New York Times, 31 October 1992 On the same night the junior company was presenting MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet in Birmingham.Parry, pp. 699–700 MacMillan had nearly finished work on the dances for a new production of Carousel by the National Theatre, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre six weeks later, with his family and many of his friends in the audience. Honours and awards MacMillan was knighted in 1983, and he received honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh (1976) and the Royal College of Art (1992). His awards include the Evening Standard Ballet Award (1979); Society of West End Theatre Managers Ballet Award, 1980 and 1983; and, posthumously, the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production in 1993 for The Judas Tree; the Society of London Theatre Special Award in 1993; and the Tony Award for Best Choreography in 1994 for Carousel.\\"MacMillan, Sir Kenneth\\", Who Was Who, Oxford University Press, April 2014, retrieved 22 November 2014 Lister, David \\"National's night of triumph: West End productions lose out as subsidised theatre dominates Olivier awards\\", The Independent, 19 April 1993; and Nightingale, Benedict. \\"For Tonys, read Brits – Tony awards\\", The Times, 14 June 1994 Choreography=Full-length ballets { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" - !

Fossils of limb bones and armor fragments have been found in middle to late Jurassic-aged strata of England and France. Discovery Limb bones, Muséum national d'histoire naturelle In the early 1880s collector Alfred Nicholson Leeds acquired a skeleton of a dinosaur excavated at a small brick pit at the hamlet of Tanholt, close to Eye, Cambridgeshire. In September 1885 the remains were shown to paleontologist Henry Woodward whose notes form the first documentation on the subject. Later it was mistakenly assumed the find had been made at the industrial brick pits at Fletton, the usual source of Leeds' specimens.Leslie F. Noè, Jeff J. Liston and Sandra D. Chapman, 2010, \\"‘Old bones, dry subject’: the dinosaurs and pterosaur collected by Alfred Nicholson Leeds of Peterborough, England\\", Geological Society, London, Special Publications 343: 49-77 In 1887 the fossil was described by John Whitaker Hulke and named as a new species of the stegosaurian Omosaurus: Omosaurus durobrivensis. The specific name referred to the old Roman town of Durobrivae.J.W. Hulke, 1887, \\"Note on some dinosaurian remains in the collection of A. Leeds, Esq, of Eyebury, Northamptonshire\\", Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society 43: 695-702 On 30 May 1892 the specimen was bought by the British Museum of Natural History. The holotype, BMNH R1989, was found in the Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation, more especially the Kosmoceras jason biozone dating from the middle Callovian. Hulke mistakenly assumed a provenance from the younger Kimmeridge Clay Formation. It consists of a sacrum of five vertebrae, and two ilia. Other bones were referred to the species, among them two plates thought to be part of the dermal armour. However, on 22 August 1888 Othniel Charles Marsh visited Leeds' collection at Eyebury and recognised these elements as belonging to a giant fish, in 1889 by Arthur Smith Woodward named Leedsichthys. The plates are in fact part of the latter's skull roof. Close up of vertebrae In 1915 Omosaurus durobrivensis was renamed Dacentrurus durobrivensis, as the name Omosaurus had been preoccupied, which had already been indicated by Marsh in the 1870s. In 1957 the French palaeontologist Robert Hoffstetter created a separate genus for the species: Lexovisaurus. The generic name is derived from the Lexovii, a Gallic tribe in ancient times inhabiting the region of Normandy, where several stegosaurian specimens had been discovered which by Hoffstetter were referred to Lexovisaurus. While the type species remains Omosaurus durobrivensis, the combinatio nova is Lexovisaurus durobrivensis. Hofstetter also referred a much more complete stegosaurian skeleton in 1901 discovered by Leeds in the Fletton brick pit, specimen BMNH R3167 that in 1911 had been named Stegosaurus priscus.Hoffstetter, R, & Brun, R., 1956, \\"Un Dinosaurien Stégosauridé dans le Callovien du Calvados\\", Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, 243: 1651-1653Hoffstetter, R., 1957, \\"Quelques observations sur les Stégosaurinés\\", Bulletin du Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, 2nde série 29: 537-547P.M.

This made Lexovisaurus a nomen dubium, while O. vetustus was found to be undiagnostic and declared a nomina dubium. Other workers though, combining the English material collected by Leeds due to its shared provenance, have considered Lexovisaurus a valid taxon.D. Naish and D. M. Martill, 2008, \\"Dinosaurs of Great Britain and the role of the Geological Society of London in their discovery: Ornithischia\\", Journal of the Geological Society of London 165: 613-623Buffetaut, E. and Morel, N., 2009, \\"A stegosaur vertebra (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the Callovian (Middle Jurassic) of Sarthe, western France\\", Comptes Rendus Palevol, 8: 545-549 In the meantime, Omosaurus vetustus has been renamed Eoplophysis,Ulansky, R.

[DOWNLOAD PDF] http://dinoweb.narod.ru/Ulansky_2014_Stegosaurs_evolution.pdf. although this genus is not regarded as valid. The nomen nudum \\"Omosaurus leedsi\\" (mistakenly considered a nomen dubium by Maidment et al. 2008) has since been referred to Loricatosaurus.Galton, P.

Description Life restoration of Lexovisaurus. If Lexovisaurus is limited to the holotype, little information about it is available apart from it having a general stegosaurian build and a pelvis width of 114 centimetres. Part of the material described by Hulke was a left femur, specimen BMNH R1991, with a length of ninety-nine centimetres, indicating a body length of about five metres (16.5 ft). The Fletton and Normandy material, suggesting a body length of about six metres and a weight of two tonnes,Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 221 show a combination of narrow flat plates on the back and round pointed spines that ran along the tail. A large spine was found that by Hoffstetter was placed on the shoulder, by Galton on the hip and by Maidment on the tail. Hoffstetter assigned Lexovisaurus to the Stegosauridae and Stegosaurinae in 1957. See also * Timeline of stegosaur research  References  Further reading  * Benton, Michael. 1992.

His exceptional play has been credited with reviving interest in box lacrosse in the 1950s. He was the father of lacrosse player Gaylord Powless. He was named an inductee for Canada's Sports Hall of Fame class of 2020/21 as a builder for lacrosse. Playing career He played with the Peterborough Timbermen when they won four consecutive Mann Cups from 1951 to 1954, during which time he lived for a while with his wife Wilma and son Gaylord in a tent at Fairy Lake, near Peterborough. He won the Mike Kelly Memorial Trophy for most valuable player in the series in 1953. In 1956, as player-coach for a Hamilton team, he won the league scoring championship and every Ontario Lacrosse Association trophy except for best goalie, for which he did not qualify.Beare, Ted. Expositor, Brantford Ontario, 27 May 2003: B1 Following his playing career, Powless coached various All-Indian teams to three national titles, including leading the Rochester Chiefs to the Can-Am Lacrosse League title in 1969. He also coached a team featuring six of his sons to the championship at the North American Indian Lacrosse Tournament, which he later said was one of his biggest thrills. He twice won the Tom Longboat Award as Canada's outstanding First Nations athlete, and was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1969. Ross is also a member of the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame. His last season as a player was in 1967 when he played for the Hagersville Warriors and in one game played in Whitby had the opportunity to play against his son Gaylord who was with the Oshawa Steelers. Ross and son Gaylord, are the only father and son inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. They are also both inducted to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame; Gaylord in the athlete category (2017), and Ross as a builder in lacrosse (2020). Coaching and leadership Ross was a member of Local 18 of the Hamilton Carpenters Union and worked on the construction of the original Burlington Skyway Bridge in 1956, and was proud of the fact that his son Gary worked on the twinning bridge in 1986. Ross was a player/coach with the Hamilton Lincoln Burners, and was involved with the formation of the Brantford Warriors. He led the establishment of hockey and lacrosse leagues on the Six Nations reserve. Ross was also a community leader, serving as a band councillor for eight years and a band administrator for twelve years. His community service was instrumental in changing the political climate on the Six Nations reserve near Brantford, Ontario. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he coached the Brantford Warriors lacrosse team, which featured four of his sons, Gaylord, Gary, Harry and Greg. The team won the Canadian Senior B championship in 1968. Ross also organized the Iroquois Nations Cup Tournament in the 1960s and 70s. In 1997, he received the volunteer service award of the Ontario Municipal Recreation Association. Personal and family In later years, Ross was a building inspector on the Six Nations Reserve outside of Brantford, and he enjoyed spending time hunting with his dogs Lady and George. Ross was also an excellent pool player, gardner, and joke teller.Zeman, B. (1988). The Hall of Famer's After-Dinner Speech: Ross Powless. In B.

It was built between 1910 and 1912 by the British on high ground on the seaward face of Benghisa Point, the southern arm of Marsaxlokk Bay. It is the southernmost fortification in Malta. It was part of a chain of fortifications intended to protect Marsaxlokk Harbour, along with Fort Delimara and Fort Tas-Silġ on Delimara point, the north arm of Marsaxlokk Bay, Fort San Lucian on Kbira point in the middle of the bay, and the Pinto and Ferretti batteries on the shores of the bay. History The fort's gatehouse Initially, a battery called Hassan Battery was proposed at Benghisa Point. However, the design was developed into a polygonal fort in 1909. Construction started in 1910 and was completed in 1912. The fort was armed with two 6 inch and two 9.2 inch breech loading guns. The 17th-century Bengħisa Tower was demolished to clear Fort Benghisa's line of fire in 1915. The fort has a ditched pentagonal perimeter, with the perimeter wall and parapet being built from earth excavated during the building of the ditch. The cliffs on the seaward side were also used as part of the fort's defensive perimeter. Fort Benghisa was the last polygonal fort that the British built in Malta. The fort was rearmed prior to World War II. In the 1950s, dual purpose guns were installed but these were dismantled soon afterwards. It was finally abandoned by the British in the late 1970s. Present day The fort is currently in private hands and its interior is inaccessible. Part of the fort was rented in 1973 for an annual sum equivalent to €93, while other parts were rented out in 1981 and 1996 for an annual €177 and €419 respectively. The rents were renewed until 2011, when the government stopped accepting them with the intention to evict the tenants. The fort and its environs are currently in a state of neglect, although the gatehouse and the shoreward ditch are in fair repair.

A new character named Mabel West, Miss Marple's great-niece, who becomes Poirot's junior assistant, is used to connect the two detectives. The series was broadcast from 4 July 2004 to 15 May 2005 on NHK, and continues to be shown in re-runs on NHK and other networks in Japan. The series was adapted as manga under the same title, which was released in 2004 and 2005.  Adaptation  The TV series is a generally faithful adaptation of the original stories given the time constraints (typically one 25-minute episode for a short story, four episodes for a novel). Despite being a modern Japanese adaptation, the original (mainly English) locations and time period are retained. The most obvious story change is the addition of Mabel West and her pet duck, Oliver. However, apart from her soliloquies, most of her lines are taken from the incidental dialogue of other characters in the original stories, so her presence does not materially alter the plot development. Other changes include Inspector Japp becoming \\"Inspector Sharpe\\", possibly due to the derogatory implications attached to the word \\"jap\\". The significance of some details which rely on English idioms is changed, for example when a dying uncle taps his eye in Strange Jest, this was originally a reference to the saying All my eye and Betty Martin, but in the anime it becomes a reference to a stamp in which an angel appears to be winking (however the clue still achieves the same end).

In January 1976, an approaching storm prompted authorities to move the ship to a different harbor. However, her engines malfunctioned and would not turn off when they were supposed to. As a result, the ship was unable to stop in time before it struck the wall of the reef. The resulting breach in the hull led authorities to strive for days to keep her afloat, until the attempts failed and the ship was abandoned. Kirk Pride was abandoned when she sank, so there was no loss of life in the sinking. The wreckage lay unnoticed until 1985, when it was discovered off the Cayman Wall. The wreck of Kirk Pride lies under 800 feet of water near the base of the Wall in George Town Harbor, Grand Cayman. Trapped by two pinnacles, one at the bow and another at the stern, it rolled down the 45–60° slope to the edge of the shelf. Underwater visibility is approximately 300 feet horizontally at this depth and twice that when looking upward. The ship has interested divers following its sinking. A brief film of the wreck can be viewed on the episode \\"Reefs and Wrecks\\" of the BBC television series Wild Caribbean, produced in 2008. The name of the ship is visible at filming on the stern.

The novel introduces the Motswana Mma Precious Ramotswe, who begins the first detective agency in Botswana, in the capital city Gaborone, after her beloved father dies. She hires a secretary and solves cases for her clients. Precious tells her own story, from birth, and her father tells his story. When her father dies, she moves from Mochudi to Gaborone, the capital city, to begin her detective agency. She solves three cases, and meets important new people, her secretary Grace Makutsi and good friend, the excellent mechanic, Mr JLB Matekoni. The novel was first published in Scotland, where it gained a following. After two more novels in the series were published, all three were published in the US to much acclaim; in 2002, for example, Publishers' Weekly called it a \\"little gem of a book\\". The series did not catch on in England, despite being so close to Scotland, until the fifth novel in the series. Plot summary Mma Ramotswe sits in her office, the Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency. She has a secretary, and she has clients. She is in Gaborone the capital of Botswana, a place of which she is proud. She is the only child of Obed Ramotswe, a man who worked long years in the mines in South Africa, until one day he witnessed a crime, and knew he had to leave the mines. He had married a year or two earlier, and their daughter was born in Mochudi. He was wise with the money he earned in the mines, using it to buy cattle and slowly grow his herd, watched by a cousin while he was in the mines. Not long after he returned, his wife died. A cousin, left by her husband because she was barren, came to help him raise his daughter Precious. The cousin taught her well, caring for her until a second man asked her to marry him, when Precious is about 10 years old. Precious continues at school until she is 16. Her father wants her to pursue more education, but she wants to stop school and does. She itches to see new places. She lives with her cousin and cousin's husband. He has a business running buses, and is doing well. She takes a job in the firm, and uncovers thievery by another employee, defrauding the company. Each weekend she takes a bus home to Mochudi to see her father. On one bus trip she meets a boy, a musician named Note Mokote. Soon he proposes marriage to her, going to her father for his permission. Precious is already pregnant at the marriage, but Note is not pleased at being a father. He beats his wife as part of his lovemaking, for any reason. Once she must see a doctor for treatment after a beating. On return home, he has left her. Her child lives only for five days. She heads back to Mochudi to be with her father until he dies from the lung disease he got in the mines, just after she is 34. Her father's herd is large, and the price was good. She sells some of the good herd of cattle to set up her office in Gaborone and buy a house there. The house is on Zebra Drive. The office is well-located. She hires Mma Makutsi from the Secretarial College and the first client appears directly. Characters *Mma Ramotswe: She starts the first detective agency in Botswana when she is 34. Prior to that time, she lived with her father, save for a brief and painful marriage to a musician. *Obed Ramotswe: Father of Precious Ramotswe, and wise breeder of cattle. He loves his daughter, focussing his life on her when his wife dies not long after he returns from the mines to live in Mochudi full time with her and their daughter. He dies at age 62, when his daughter is 34. *The cousin: Woman, a cousin of Obed Ramotswe, who is left by her first husband because she cannot have children. She raises Precious until she is about 10 years old. Then, she is asked to marry a second time, to a man successful in his own business running buses in Botswana. *Note Mokote: The musician who catches the eye of Precious after she has been living with the cousin near Gaborone, working in the husband's firm. Note is cruel to her, and leaves her pregnant after a few months of marriage. *Mma Grace Makutsi: Hired as secretary to the detective agency based on the college's reference. She earned the highest score from the Secretarial College, at 97 percent. She wears large oval glasses. * Mr JLB Matekoni: Auto mechanic with his own business, Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. He has known Mma Ramotswe for years, as her father was friends with his uncle. The new detective agency is not far from his garage. He proposes marriage to her twice. He is ten years older than her. * Happy Bapetsi: A client who never met her father is confronted by a man who claims that role, and her care of him. * Mr Patel: Very rich retired businessman in Gaborone, a client with a 16 year old daughter who worries him. he engages Mma Ramotswe to find what boy his daughter is meeting. * Dr Maketsi: Doctor who treated Obed Ramotswe in his last illness, and later becomes her client with a problem he has with a doctor in the hospital. Themes=National identity In the second chapter, the author states, through Obed’s character, that Precious’ father is proud to be a Motswana because of Botswana's political stability. Alexander McCall Smith describes Mma Ramotswe as an African patriot, who loves Africa \\"for all its trials.\\" He says that they never had political prisoners, that their banks are full of money and that they owe nothing. Animals Africa is home to many dangerous and some of the most feared creatures. The novel describes snakes and the crocodiles with great emotion and drama. In domestic life, the cattle in Africa are important. Always needed for food, care of cattle is a vital skill, and in some ways a currency in the local economy. Allusions to historical events, persons Part of the novel's plot is based on the murder of Segametsi Mogomotsi in 1994, a ritual killing in Mochudi. The novel gives a happier ending to the story, as the kidnapped child is not murdered, and Mma Ramotswe rescues him. Reviews This novel gained more reviews when the second and third novels were published in the US in 2002. A reviewer in 2014 in The Guardian says \\"I really enjoyed this book, I found it thoroughly entertaining. Sometimes, while reading, I'd get so involved with the case Mma Ramotswe was solving that I wouldn't leave my chair until the case got over.\\" The Dallas Public Library review says of Precious Ramotswe: \\"Always optimistic and appreciative of her life in her beloved country, Mma has more than common insight into human foibles and is therefore able to tackle her cases not so much from evidence (of which there is some) but from the psychology of the people involved.\\" Publishers Weekly considers this a \\"little gem of a book\\" the pace desultory, which works well, as \\"Mma Ramotswe's love of Africa, her wisdom and humor, shine through these pages as she shines her own light on the problems that vex her clients.\\" The novel explores Botswana with a deft touch as well as telling the detective stories, \\"in a way that is both penetrating and light\\". Kirkus Reviews is upbeat about the first novel, mentioning it with the next two in its review, and feels that the main character is ready for prime time. \\"Precious Ramotswe . . . she's ready for prime time. The first American publication of this 1999 debut has been preceded by two special Booker citations and two sequels, Tears of the Giraffe (2000) and Morality for Beautiful Girls (2001), both forthcoming in the series.\\" Publication history This novel was released in 1998 in Scotland.

Renovations The main floor was originally dirt, which was not uncommon for a collegiate multi-purpose field house in that era; Hec Edmundson Pavilion in Seattle long had an unfinished earthen floor. With its usage as a rodeo venue, the dirt surface in Bozeman was practical at the time. A portable raised basketball court was assembled in the center of the space and wooden boardwalks led spectators from the entrance to the concession stand and bleachers. Basketball players were obliged to wipe their feet after emerging from the dressing rooms and before stepping up to the court. In 1980, the entire arena floor was covered with a hard tartan (polyurethane) surface and new folding bleachers were installed on the main level. Other than the new floor, the facility changed very little in its first forty years.Renovation Montana vs. MSU basketball player introductions, 2017 In 1998, a $13.2 million renovation was completed that transformed the building into a modern multi- purpose arena. A new main entrance was constructed on the south side that brings spectators into the arena at the mezzanine level. Elevators and other features were added to make the building handicapped accessible. Old bleacher and chairback seats were replaced. The building's mechanical systems were upgraded, and additional fire, life-safety, and seismic features were added to bring the building up to modern codes. The renovation also featured new administrative and coaches offices, locker room improvements, better concession stands, new reception areas, and a new Hall of Fame. The arena can be converted quickly from athletic events to concerts, to theater performances.

The football teams of San Jose High School and Lincoln face off at San Jose City College each Thanksgiving in the Big Bone Game. This rivalry game has been held since 1942 and is held annually at neutral-site San Jose City College. It gets its name from a San Jose High School student who, in 1942, found a large steer leg in his father's butcher shop and declared it the trophy for the winning school. The junior varsity football teams from both schools hold the Little Bone Game annually on the Thursday prior to the Big Bone Game. The track and field is named after Don Bowden, a Lincoln High School student who went on to the Olympics and to become the first American to beat the 4 minute mile.http://twofeet.weebly.com/walking-blog/bikes-guns-and-fast-feet-lincoln- high-school Demographics 0.3% American Indian, 4.4% Asian, 2.4% Filipino, 3.0% African American, 16.9% White, 69.2% Latino, 0.5% Pacific Islander, two more races 2.2% Notable alumni *Don Bowden, an Olympic runner and the first American to break the 4 minute mile.http://bringbackthemile.com/news/detail/don_bowden_opened_gateway_for_american_milers *Courtney Bryan, professional American football player *Lorna Dee Cervantes, poetLorna Dee Cervantes *Bob Bowman (outfielder), former Major League Baseball player for Philadelphia Phillies *Megan Dirkmaat, 2004 Summer Olympics silver medalist; Rowing *Shamako Noble, hip-hop artist and political activist *Bud Ogden, professional basketball player *Ralph Ogden, professional basketball player ReferencesExternal links *Official website *San Jose Unified School District Category:San Jose Unified School District Category:High schools in San Jose, California Category:Public high schools in California Category:Magnet schools in California ","title":"Abraham Lincoln High School (San Jose, California)"},{"id":"3563675","text":"Flash burn is any burn injury caused by intense flashes of light, high voltage electric current, or strong thermal radiation.
