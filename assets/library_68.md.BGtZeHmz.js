He is the founder of the Russian noble family of Poltoratsky. Biography Father ‚Äì Cossack Fyodor Poltoratsky ‚Äì settled in the centenary town of Sosnitsa of the Chernigov Regiment of the Hetman's Ukraine and accepted the priesthood. During the period of the hetmanship of Daniel Apostle, on April 28, 1729, son Mark was born in Fyodor Poltoratsky's family. The boy grew up clever, inquisitive, and his father identified him in the \\"Latin schools\\" of Chernigov, in which he studied for four years. Then his studies continued within the walls of the Kiev-Mogila Academy. Since childhood, Mark had a beautiful voice and, as a student, he sang in an academic choir. In 1744, Mark‚Äôs voice was heard by Count Alexei Razumovsky (himself a former chorister), who accompanied Empress Elizabeth Petrovna on her trip to Ukraine. A year later, the young man left his Kiev classmates and decided to go to St. Petersburg for the singing service in the choir at the imperial court. Mark's career was developing successfully, he was soon appointed as the \\"installer\\" of the court choir. In 1750 he was the first of the Slavs enlisted in the Italian opera troupe, acted under the name \\"Marko Porturatsky\\". Three years later he was appointed regent of the Court Singing Chapel. With nominal decrees of the Empress, he repeatedly traveled to select the best voices to Ukraine. In 1754 he was promoted to colonel. Mark Poltoratsky selected the \\"small singers\\", listening to church, monastic, school and other choirs in the hetman's regiments. Dmitry Bortniansky, 9 years old, the son of a Cossack of the Glukhovsky Hundreds of the Nezhinsky Regiment, got into the register of \\"small singers\\" of October 30, 1760.

He died in St. Petersburg and was buried at the Lazarevskoe Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

Common names for this species include the wrinkled seapump, the wrinkled sea squirt and the warty tunicate. Description This sea squirt is nearly as tall as it is wide, growing to about . It is not attached to the substrate by a stalk, as are some members of the genus, but is attached over a wide base and appears roughly globular, with two obvious siphons projecting upwards. these siphons can be projected a long way when feeding, and can be retracted if danger threatens. The tunic is tough, wrinkled and folded, and does not have spiny projections. The color is usually dark brown, tinged with red on the siphons, but much of the surface is often hidden by sand, shell fragments or debris adhering to the tunic, or the tunic may be overgrown with other organisms. Distribution and habitat Pyura haustor is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean where its range extends from the Shumagin Islands in Alaska southwards to San Diego County, California. It is found attached to rocks, piers, pilings and floats, as well as to the holdfasts of kelp. It occurs in both sheltered and exposed locations, but in the San Juan Islands, where it is common, it avoids the areas with the strongest currents. Its depth range is from the lower intertidal zone down to about . Ecology Like other tunicates, this sea squirt draws in large quantities of water through its buccal siphon, filters out the edible particles and expels the water through the atrial siphon. Among the planktonic particles ingested are a variety of invertebrate larvae, however researchers have found that the activities of the sea squirt are not sufficient to deplete the local larval populations appreciably. The diet includes the eggs and larvae of crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and other tunicates. The eggs of this sea squirt are gray, but there are conflicting reports on whether this species liberates the eggs into the water column or whether the developing embryos are brooded. The seastar Solaster stimpsoni is a predator of this tunicate.

Managerial career Almeida spent his early managerial career as an assistant at Estoril and Trofense. His first stint as a professional manager was with the Syria under-23 team in an attempt for qualification to the 2012 Summer Olympics. A polyglot (speaking Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, English and French), he left Syria to become assistant manager to Jesualdo Ferreira at Panathinaikos, Sporting, Braga and Zamalek before managing again with Red Star in Ligue 2 in June 2015. He was dismissed in December 2016 when the club was in 16th, and had been eliminated from the Coupe de France by fifth-tier Blagnac. Almeida then joined Bastia in Ligue 1 in February 2017, on a two-and-a-half-year contract; the Corsican team was five points within the relegation zone. He left in June, as the team faced a financial crisis after their descent. On 30 May 2018, Almeida was announced as the manager of Troyes in Ligue 2, on a two-year deal. He led the team to third, one point off promotion, in his only season and was then linked to English club West Bromwich Albion, though no official approach was ever made. In July 2019, Almeida was appointed manager of Caen, newly relegated to Ligue 2. He signed a two-year deal with the option of a third, and compensation was paid for his remaining year contracted to Troyes. After a poor start to the season, he was removed from his duties on 28 September. Almeida was given his first outright job in his own country at the end of May 2019, when he was chosen to succeed V√≠tor Oliveira at Gil Vicente F.C. in the Primeira Liga.

Career In 1997-98, Rai taught as a visiting Lecturer at the Tufts University. In 1999, she taught as Adjunct Instructor at the Columbia University. Between 1999-2007, she served as assistant professor first at the Bowdoin College and later at Yale University. From 2007-10, she served as an associate professor at the Yale University.

She is currently working on a history of Kashmir and on the geography of justice pertaining to caste violence in North India. Publications =Book= * Her book Hindu Rulers, Muslim Subjects won a prize for the \\"first best book on an international subject\\" from Yale University. Hindu Rulers, Muslim Subjects: Islam, Rights, and the History of Kashmir In 2004, Rai published Hindu Rulers, Muslim Subjects: Islam, Rights, and the History of Kashmir. W.W. Reinhardt of Randolph-Macon College notes that Rai's scholarly work examines Kashmiri history since the state of Jammu and Kashmir was \\"bizzarely created\\" in 1846, how Gulab Singh cemented his \\"dubious position\\" with reference to Hindu symbolism and how the Kashmiri Muslim population fell into a condition of \\"abject helplessness\\" by the 1930s. Weinhardt concludes by giving the book his highest recommendation for all levels. Sumit Ganguly in a review in the Journal of Asian Studies, notes \\"Rai's contribution lies in the extremely thorough and painstaking documentation\\". He adds that, \\"her account of the growth of Muslim religio-political consciousness in the early part of the twentieth century ... unearths a wealth of detail. He further adds that, \\"Rai's book is a useful one. Those interested in understanding the background of the continuing tragedy in Kashmir will find much to consider in her substantial account of the historical backdrop\\". Tapan Raychaudhri calls Rai's account of the way the sovereignty of the Dogras, with no basis in Kashmir, interacted with the British rule, \\"illuminating.\\" Alexander Evans of the King's College London calls the book \\"a major contribution to Kashmir studies\\". He adds that it sets \\"the standard for the next generation of publications on Kashmir. Challenging the existing literature, this work is heady and fresh--and deserves attention.\\" Peter van der Veer of the University of Amsterdam notes that the book reminds readers of the \\"crucial importance of colonial history to the present\\". He adds that Rai is \\"able to de-essentialize religion and secularism in the Kashmir conflict, which is very useful in light of India's secularist claims and the ways in which some sociologists have theorized those claims\\". He further adds: \\"Carefully researched and lucidly conceptualized and written, this book forwards an important thesis on an important topic\\". Sugata Bose of Harvard University calls it \\"a brilliant work of historical scholarship that will become indispensable reading\\". He further added that it is \\"a pioneering historical study of rights, religion, and regional identity in Kashmir that could also inspire future studies on other regions of the subcontinent\\". Roger D. Long in the 'History: Reviews of New Books' journal, notes that the book \\"is a post-modernist tract and an exercise in the usual identity politics that aims to 'reinsert' the people of Kashmir into the history of the state\\". Long concludes that this is a useful work for Kashmir's history since 1846. Aaron Peron Ogletree reiterates the value of Rai's work on Kashmiri history. Chandra D. Bhatta calls it an \\"excellent piece of historical scholarship.\\" Raychaudhri observes that this \\"highly scholarly work\\" examines the role of religion in Kashmir's geopolitics since 1846. Rai examines the legitimacy of the Dogra state and argues that its fall lay in its sidelining of the Muslim population in favour of Hindu nationalism. Bhatta concludes by highlighting that the book is a \\"valuable contribution\\" to the scholarship on Kashmir. = Chapters in books =   =Journal articles=  * =Review essays= * =Book reviews=   References Category:Living people Category:Indian women historians Category:Historians of South Asia Category:Tufts University faculty Category:20th-century Indian historians Category:Presidency University, Kolkata faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mridu Rai"},{"id":"59656815","text":"Piero Antonio Bonnet (Comacchio, August 2, 1940 ‚Äì Rome, February 18, 2018) was an Italian jurist and the iudex unicus of the Vatican City State.scomparsa Professore Piero Antonio Bonnet Biography From 1947 to 1953, he studied at the Nobile Collegio Mondragone run by the Jesuits in Frascati.

March 2018Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Remembering Dale Emery\\", written 23 March 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018)), nicknamed \\"The Snail\\" (sometimes \\"Schnoz\\"), was an American drag racer. Emery raced Fuel Altereds and Funny Cars, and briefly in wheelstanders,Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Dale Emery: A life of Pure Hell, wild rides, and big wins\\", written 14 August 2012, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) as well as serving as crew chief for several top teams.  Personal life  Emery was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma and was raised in Northern California. Emery was easy-going and fun-loving, friendly with Willie Borsch, Dale Funk, Rich Guasco, and John \\"Tarzan\\" Austin, and long-time friends with Pat Galvin. While generous with tools and equipment, even to competitors, he was also extremely hard-working and focused in dealing with his racing. He was married to Brenda, and lived near Dallas, Texas. Emery died after a prolonged illness.  Career  In 1955, he began racing, starting with a C/G ‚Äò41 Chevrolet coup√© gassers. He moved up to fuel cars in 1959, running a rear-engined coup√©. He returned to the gas classes in 1960, at the wheel of a dragster, before taking the wheel of car owner Woody Parker's Top Fuel dragster (TF/D) in 1962. That car was built by Pete Ogden, who also built the Pure Hell Fuel Altered (AA/FA) for Rich Guasco. When Don Petrich quit the Pure Hell team in 1965, Emery replaced him, and stayed five seasons; he frequently match raced his friend \\"Wild Willie\\" Borsch. It was while driving Pure Hell he met D. Gannt, who was a crewman for Borsch, during that time.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Remembering Dale Emery\\", written 23 March 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018)2018) Pure Hell was entered in a 1968 showdown event between Funny Cars and Altereds at OCIR; Emery won the event. A week later, he recorded a pass, on his way to winning the Hot Rod Magazine Championships at Riverside Raceway (and bettering Borsch's pass of the year before), a speed no Altered would surpass that season. After Pure Hell was wrecked, Guasco fielded a Pure Hell Funny Car; Emery denies ever driving the car, though some sources say he did. Of his time with Guasco's team, Emery said, ‚ÄúDriving the Pure Hell was the most fun of anything I ever did. There was no money to be made doing it, but we did it because we liked racing.‚Äù From Guasco's AA/FA team, Emery went to the fuel slingshot of the Rousin-O‚ÄôHare team in 1970, where he spent six months and won TF/D at DIMS. His next ride was in partnership with Gary Watson on the Flying Red Baron wheelstander Mustang, which he helped build‚Äîand crashed. After the rollover, Emery refused to drive it again, believing \\"it was too much of a clown deal\\" Emery first encountered \\"Waterbed Fred\\" Miller, with whom he would continue to associate for more than fifty years, when Emery and Gannt came into Bob Riggle's Mansfield, Ohio, shop with Flying Red Baron. Delivering Don and Roy Gay‚Äôs Infinity to Riggle, who had just purchased the funny car, led to Emery driving for the new owner. Riggle owned the famous Hemi Under Glass wheelstander, and gave Emery his first Funny Car ride. Emery later worked for Sam Harris at Chaparral trailers. Starting a Funny Car team in 1973, Jeg Coughlin, Sr. hired Emery to drive for him; he was joined by Gantt (then on Willie Borsch's crew) and Miller. Coughlin's Chevrolet Camaro won the IHRA national event at Bristol that year, taking a win over Pat Foster in Barry Setzer's Vega.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Remembering Dale Emery\\", written 23 March 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018). Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) makes no mention of it, here or here ; this page omits any mention of Foster or the Setzer Vega. Emery won Funny Car at Le Grandnational at Sanair in 1973, defeating Frank Mancuso in the final. Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) At the U.S. Nationals, Emery qualified #10, and was eliminated in round one by #2 qualifier \\"Jungle Jim\\" Liberman. Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) The same month, he won the IHRA All American Nationals at Bristol Motor Speedway, defeating top qualifier Raymond Beadle in the final,38035 Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) and lost to Foster at the IHRA U.S. Open at North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina. Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) He also reached the final round in the 1973 Supernationals at Ontario, being eliminated by Tom \\"Moogoo$e\\" McEwen,.Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 12 January 2019) Emery finished the 1973 season in spectacular fashion. \\"Moogoo$e\\" McEwen, though successful as a match racer, had yet to win his first NHRA national event; his 1973 Duster qualified #17 and only made the field at all after Bobby Rowe could not race. Emery reached the semifinal (having recorded a best pass of 6.28), where he faced Don \\"The Snake\\" Prudhomme, who was eager to face teammate McEwen. Going to the staging lights, Emery had a fuel line fitting leaking at one injector, but hoped it would survive the pass. Instead, the supercharger exploded and the body blew off the chassis, flipping the car over and slamming into the hay bales at the end of the strip. Replacing the destroyed one with a new, lighter body (Emery always passionate about weight reduction), qualifying #6, the team defeated \\"Snake\\" Prudhomme and Dale Pulde, to meet the 1973 Vega of Frank Hall in the final, and win Funny Car, at the Winternats in 1974, taking home a purse of US$13,800. Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) When Coughlin stopped touring with his team, the Emery and Gannt combination provided two wins at NHRA national events that year before Coughlin decided to quit racing to focus on his mail order business. Emery quit in a disagreement over pay, and went back to Chaparral. Emery briefly drove the Vega, owned by Fuel Altered racers Leroy Chadderton and Glen Okazaki (the car later raced in Britain as Gladiator), turning in one pass at 6.99 with the car on fire, after a valve lifter failure. At the 1975 IHRA World Nationals, Emery qualified Gene \\"Snowman\\" Snow's Vega #5, only to be eliminated in the first round by #1 qualifier (and eventual event winner) Dale Pulde. Ultimateracinghistory.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) In 1976 and 1977, Emery and ‚ÄúBig Mike‚Äù Burkhart worked together, making the final at the first ever NHRA Cajun Nationals, where Emery lost to Beadle. The duo also had peculiarly bad luck against McEwen. Emery wrecked Burkhart‚Äôs silver Camaro fuel funny car at the 1977 U.S. Nationals. Though track marshals had to cut him from the car, Emery suffered only a broken bone in his left arm, which was pierced by the lever of the fuel shut-off valve. It proved to be his last race. The day after his 1977 wreck, Emery returned to the track with his arm in a cast, and was offered the chance to tune the Blue Max, which had been in the left lane the day before, by Beadle; Emery hesitated to accept, having only ever tuned his own cars before that. When Beadle also offered to let Emery work as a substitute driver, he accepted. He eventually joined the team and, working with Miller and Gannt, Emery drove Blue Max, hired by Beadle (on behalf of car owner and team tuner Harry Schmidt). Emery transformed the troubled team into one \\"that dominated Funny Car in the late 1970s and 1980s\\". 1978 was a difficult year for Emery. The Blue Max had been a top ten car three years running before that, but suffered persistent fuel system difficulties, keeping the car from even doing successful burnouts, for most of a year. When that was cured, Blue Max promptly won at Seattle, Boise, and Kansas City. Qualifying for the 1978 Nattionals, the team recorded their first five-second pass, a 5.98, making Beadle just the second driver in the fives.Prudhomme had done it at the World Finals at Ontario in 1975. Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Dale Emery: A life of Pure Hell, wild rides, and big wins\\", written 14 August 2012, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) They closed 1978 by defeating Tom \\"Mongoo$e\\" McEwen at the World Finals. This was precursor to winning NHRA's Funny Car championship the next three seasons in a row. In 1979, Emery tuned Blue Max to final round finishes at the Winternationals, Springnationals, and Mile-High Nationals, and wins at the Summernationals and Fallnationals, just edging out Don Prudhomme. Blue Max took three event wins and two final-round finishes in 1980, easily beating Billy Meyer, and capped a victorious 1981 season with a win at NHRA's most prestigious event, the U.S. Nats. Beadle's increasing attention on NASCAR left the Blue Max suffering, though Emery tuned the car, driven by \\"Lil' John\\" Lombardo, to a win at Indy in 1985; it was eventually sold in 1990. Following the sale of Blue Max, Emery opened Dale Emery Fuel Systems, to provide fuel pumps and fuel injectors for nostalgia drag racing teams, as well a small number of existing teams. By 2012, he was supplying a Blue Max nostalgia funny car team.  Incidents  Emery survived a couple of frightening incidents. While driving Pure Hell at Fremont Dragstrip, an improperly fastened steering wheel came off the steering column, and the car ended up in a flooded ditch, upside down, forcing him to hold his breath until the car could be righted. While racing at the 1977 U.S. Nationals, Burkhart's silver Camaro fuel funny car got out of shape, veering toward the centerline (reminiscent of an Altered), then swerved toward the guardrail and abruptly stood on its nose, something never seen before or since (through 2012), rotating along the rail two or three times before coming to rest.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Dale Emery: A life of Pure Hell, wild rides, and big wins\\", written 14 August 2012, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018); Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Dale Emery: A life of Pure Hell, wild rides, and big wins\\", written 14 August 2012, at NHRA.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) Though track marshals had to cut him from the car, Emery suffered only a broken bone in his left arm, which was pierced by the lever of the fuel shut-off valve. It proved to be his last race. = Talent = Besides being a driver, Emery was a skilled innovator and engineer, able to conceive and build parts when needed, including the team's first sixteen-plug heads, as well as a revival of an old idea, dual magnetos. His ability to innovate, and to build from scratch, has been compared to Dick LaHaie, Alan Johnson, Tim Richards, Austin Coil, and Don Garlits.

Having resided on the Costa Brava for years, his oeuvre has been praised for conveying rare beauty and serenity, while taking after the vivid luminosity distinctively seen in the art of native mediterranean masters. Romero Redondo's oeuvre has been exhibited with honors across borders in Europe and beyond. Life and career Raised in an art loving family, Romero Redondo took an early interest in drawing and sketching at school. At 19 he enrolled at San Fernando Faculty of Fine Arts in Madrid where he graduated as a \\"Licenciado\\" in sculpture in 1982. 2014, Pastel by Vicente Romero Redondo, 116x89 cm For several years he worked as a nomad street portraitist along coastal locations on the Spanish peninsula and islands while self-learning and further developing his plastic expression skills, until finally adopting pastel as his most favoured medium. Romero Redondo settled on Calonge, Costa Brava in 1987 where his art matured to his present luminous mediterranean style. Regarded as a pastelist master, Romero Redondo has been recently distinguished as a special guest at international pastel events in France, Turkey and Philippines. Besides Spain, his work has also been exhibited in many other countries including Italy, Russia, the US, Taiwan and China, among others.

The case was widely publicized by Chicago newspapers. Multiple police investigations failed to determine the couple's fate. Background At the time of their disappearance, the Andrews resided in Arlington Heights. Edward Andrews was a manager and bookkeeper for a Chicago manufacturer, and Stephania was a credit investigator. Both were planning to retire within the year. Disappearance On the evening of May 15, 1970, the Andrews attended a cocktail party at the Sheraton-Chicago hotel, located at 505 North Michigan Avenue. About 9:30 PM, the hotel‚Äôs parking garage valet and manager observed Edward Andrews \\"staggering\\" as he approached his vehicle. When exiting the garage, the Andrews' vehicle sideswiped a door at which time the valet observed Stephania Andrews seated in the front passenger seat, crying. Edward Andrews then proceeded out of the garage onto the lower deck of Michigan Avenue where he illegally drove south in the northbound lanes toward the Michigan Avenue Bridge and Wacker Drive. This was the last reported sighting of the Andrews and their vehicle, a 1969 Oldsmobile. The Andrews failed to attend a scheduled dinner party the next night and neither reported to work the following Monday. Investigation Police theorized that the couple drowned when Andrews attempted a U-turn on the lower level of the Michigan Avenue bridge and accidentally drove into the Chicago River through an area unprotected by a guardrail. Police searched the river twice during the spring and summer of 1970 using dragging equipment, sonar, and divers, but failed to locate their vehicle. According to Edward Andrews‚Äô coworkers, he became ill during lunch on the day he vanished and remained sick for the rest of the afternoon. Attendees at the cocktail party reported that Andrews appeared ill, but told his wife that he was hungry and wished to leave the party in order to get a meal. Police speculated that Andrews may have been intoxicated or suffering from a disorienting illness when he drove out of the hotel's garage. Police discounted robbery as a theory since the couple carried little cash or valuables at the time they vanished and their bank accounts and credit cards showed no activity in the months that followed. The Andrews left behind all of their personal belongings in their home. Friends and neighbors described the couple as conscientious and unlikely to leave town without notifying their employers and family. Later developments In 1971, additional searches of the Chicago River and adjacent areas of Lake Michigan were carried out at which time a sonar technician stated he was ‚Äú95% sure‚Äù the car was not in the area. In 1973, an Arlington Heights detective speculated that a barge might have crushed the Andrews' car into the river bottom or pushed it out into the lake. In 1974, a tip led police to carry out underwater searches in the harbor near Navy Pier but no further evidence was found. In 1975, a psychic became involved with the case and stated that the couple had been murdered on Chicago's South Side. In 1976, another psychic claimed that the Andrews were murdered and their bodies and their car were submerged in a lake. The couple was declared legally dead in 1978. In 1994, the case was revived when a tipster informed police that the couple had been murdered and then submerged with their car in a Green Oaks, Illinois pond. Police searched the pond and found no evidence of the Andrews or their car.

One particularly large rock smashed the front windshield and crushed her skull. In December 2018, five teenage boys from a nearby Jewish religious boarding schools where detained as suspects of the crime. Four of them were released in January 2019, but the last one, a 16-year-old boy were held until he was placed in house arrest in May. In May 2020, it was reported that he had been allowed to return home to his settlement in the West Bank. His trial has not yet begun. The attack was labelled a terrorist attack by the Israeli government but Aisha al-Rabi's family has not received compensation from it because they are not Israeli citizens. They are currently processing against the Israeli government to receive what they think is fair compensation for the attack.  The killing  Aisha, her husband Yaqoub (also translit: Aykube), 51, and her daughter Rama, 8, were on their way home to Bidya, Salfit Governorate in the northwestern West Bank, south of Nablus from Hebron where one of Aisha and Yaqoub's six daughters live. They were traveling in their car on Highway 60. At around 9:30 pm Yaqoub, who drove the car, slowed down about 100 meters before the Tapuah Junction where a permanent Israeli checkpoint is located. At that point, a group of settlers on the right shoulder of the road began hurling stones at the car. The front windshield and the right passenger side window where Aisha was sitting was hit by the barrage. One particularly heavy rock, weighing roughly two kilos, was dropped on the car, smashing the windshield and hitting her on the right side of her face on the ear as she was talking to Yaqoub. The rock crushed her skull and caused her to lose consciousness. Yaqoub rushed Aisha to Rafidia hospital in Nablus, a 20 minutes drive away, where his wife was pronounced dead.  Investigation  A few days later, the Israeli secret police, Shin Bet, began investigating the case. Itamar Ben-Gvir, leader of the far-right party Otzma Yehudit was critical of the agency's involvement: \\"Experience shows the Jewish Division investigates... in an aggressive and problematic manner which does not allow the truth to come out, but at most brings out false confessions.\\" According to The Times of Israel, the involvement of Shin Bet indicated that the authorities suspected that the attack was carried out by settlers. The investigation led Shin Bet to focus on Pri Ha'aretz, a religious boarding school in Rechelim,Jacob Magid, ‚ÄòMurder suspects‚Äô yeshiva seen as a radical bastion in a more moderate settlement,‚Äô The Times of Israel 8 January 2019:'Pri Haaretz opened its doors in the fall of 2016 and is home to roughly 70 students.

This was seen as suspicious because Saturday is the Jewish day of rest and most religious Jews would observe the religious injunction to not drive on that day. At the end of December 2018, the Shin Bet arrested three students from Pri Ha'aretz and interrogated them for a week without allowing them to meet with attorneys. Five days later, two more students were arrested and were also prevented from meeting with lawyers. On January 6, 2019, it was announced that the minors had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder. On January 10, four of the minors were released but kept under house arrest.Jacob Magid,'Court releases four of five suspects in Aisha Rabi killing to house arrest,' The Times of Israel 10 January 2019 On January 15, a Statement of Claimant was filed in court by the prosecutor on the intention to file an indictment against the 16-year-old minor who remained in detention. During these weeks Shin Bet came under fire from settler and pro-settler groups who accused it of torturing the suspects. Shin Bet denied the allegation and released evidence from the investigation to justify why it had to keep the minors detained. Among the evidence was an Israeli flag with a swastika drawn over the Star of David and the text \\"Death to Zionists\\" written on it. On January 24, 2019, an indictment was filed against the minor on suspicion of manslaughter, stone throwing at a vehicle and intentional sabotage of a vehicle, all under the circumstances of a terrorist act. According to the indictment, the minor threw a rock that weighs close to two kilograms in order to harm vehicle passengers of Arab descent.

The chief pathologist at the National Center of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir, Dr. Hen Kugel, stated regarding the wounds: \\"In searching the professional literature, there was no case found in which such broad wounds [found on the victim] were the result of one strike of a stone.\\" However, he noted that he was one of seven pathologists at Abu Kabir who studied the case and only two of them agreed with his conclusion, two found the evidence inconclusive, and two believed that the evidence indeed showed that the wounds had been caused by a single rock. The minor was subsequently released to house arrest. In May 2020, it was reported that he had been allowed to return home to his settlement in the West Bank. He has not yet been brought to trial. Responses The US Consulate General in Jerusalem expressed condolences for Aisha Rabi's family and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. Jason Greenblatt, the US Special Envoy for Middle East Negotiations, also expressed condolences for Aisha's family and called her killing \\"reprehensible.\\" The United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov condemned the attack and called the Israeli authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Minister of Tourism Yariv Levin criticized left-wing activists for blaming Jewish incidents, claiming they were basing their allegations on \\"scraps of an incident.\\" Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked meet with the families of the five suspects on January 7, 2019 to hear their concerns.  Compensation  Israeli victims of political violence or their relatives are eligible for compensation from the Israeli National Insurance Institute. In January 2020, it was revealed that Aisha al-Rabi's family was not eligible for compensation because she was not an Israeli citizen. Though the family would have the right to appeal to an inter-governmental committee the Israeli Defense Ministry said. Nabila Kaboub, one of the lawyers representing al-Rabi's family said she would appeal the decision. She further demanded that the defendant's home be demolished, referring to the Israeli policy of demolishing homes belonging to Palestinian attackers. In August 2020, the Israeli government offered NIS 670,000 in compensation to the family. The family who had demanded over NIS 7 million in compensation rejected the government's offer.

It is located in the city of Ypsilanti in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The dam was constructed in 1914, and the resulting reservoir is an unnamed 177-acre (31.1 ha) pond along the river. The Peninsular Paper Dam is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) downstream from the Superior Dam and 6.5 miles (10.4 km) upstream from the Ford Lake Dam. The dam is approximately 42.4 miles (68.2 km) from the river mouth at Lake Erie. In May 2019, the Ypsilanti city council voted to completely remove the dam in the future instead of continuing costly maintenance to repair the aging dam. History The Peninsular Paper Company, the dam, and power station in the early 1900s The first dam was built on the site by the Peninsular Paper Company as early as 1867. At the same time, a large paper mill was constructed on the south side of the river, and a smaller one was built directly across the river in 1876. The smaller paper mill was heavily damaged by a fire in 1898. That mill was closed down, and the surviving equipment was moved to the larger facility. The original dam was replaced with the current dam in 1914. Heavy rain caused a dam failure on May 14, 1918 that caused considerable damage to some bridges further downstream, and the dam was completely repaired within two years. The larger facility remained in operation until 1970. In 1986, the city of Ypsilanti acquired the land with intent to restore it or convert the facilities for other usage, but the ideas never materialized before it was decided to demolish the remaining structures. The larger south-side paper mill was demolished in 2004 to make room for two residential apartment buildings called the Peninsular Place Apartments. The only remaining remnant of this paper mill is the original chimney that now stands in the courtyard of the apartment complex. Current status The hollowed out exterior of the smaller north-side paper mill and signage remains standing. The surrounding area has been reorganized as Peninsular Park and is a popular destination for picnickers and shore fishermen. The dam is directly across North Huron River Drive from the main campus of Eastern Michigan University. In September 2018, the city of Ypsilanti and the Huron River Watershed Council conducted a report to assess the feasibility of removing the Peninsular Dam and remaining structures. The report concluded that dam removal is feasible. The dam has a \\"high\\" hazard potential classification, which means a high degree of damage will result if the dam should fail in the future, although the structural integrity of the dam is fair. An early estimated cost of the demolition of the dam exceeded $800,000. The dam is considered obsolete, because it no longer serves an economic purpose and is in need of repairs and ongoing maintenance. The report stated the possibility of maintaining the existing connected powerhouse structure and sign atop it, as the structure poses no hazard and is an iconic feature in the area. On May 7, 2019, the Ypsilanti city council voted 5‚Äì1 to approve an initial $500,000 toward the deconstruction of the dam instead of continuing maintenance of the now-defunct structure. Upon further assessment, the total cost of removing the dam is estimated at $2.7‚Äì4.3 million. No future timeline has been set, although the surrounding parkland may be preserved and possibly upgraded.

Besides novels and stories, she also published plays, children's stories and travelogues. In 1899, she married Wlllem van Gogh; the couple had two daughters and three sons. They lived in Lisse and then Sassenheim. After 1906, they lived in Haarlem. From 1919 to 1924, they lived in Arnhem; in 1924, they moved to Amsterdam.

History Previously a milling town, the locale was flooded when a dam was built on the Catawba River to create Lake Norman in 1959. John J. Shuford and Avery M. Powell built Long Island Mill in the early 1850s. Brothers Columbus and Wilfred Turner bought the mill in 1881. It was located \\"on a mile-long stretch of island in one of the river's wider spots\\". Columbus Turner built a house nearby which he called Mont Beaux, which the mill workers pronounced Monbo. Eventually, the Turners called their company Monbo Mill Company. In the late 1880s, they sold Long Island Mill to English businessman Jim Brown and focused on Monbo Mill. Osborne Brown took over the Long Island Mill after his father';s death in 1894. The Turners expanded their operation into Iredell County and created the mill village of East Monbo. In 1910, they replaced a wooden dam which went across only part of the river to Goat Island, named for the wild goats in the area. The new concrete dam went all the way across the river. World War I helped the business succeed, as soldiers needed warm uniforms and blankets. The idea for a dam on the Catawba River dated back to before 1900. Buck and Benjamin Duke saw dams on the Catawba as a way to help industry. Duke Power had planned for a dam in this area since the early 1920s, when the company bought Long Island Mill, Monbo Mill and other properties to prepare for the building of a new lake. Superior Yarns Company operated Long Island Mill when it closed October 3, 1959 for the building of Lake Norman. 120 people worked in each of the mills at the time. The workers still lived in the mill villages for $1 per month and free electricity. Duke let the workers keep the homes if they could move them, since the entire area would soon be part of the lake.

Hadley was Nashville, Tennessee's first African American librarian, serving as the first librarian of the Nashville Negro Public Library, a branch of the Nashville Public Library for African American patrons. She went on to work at the Chicago Public Library for almost twenty years, building and promoting the library's collection of African American history and culture. Early life and education Marian M. Hadley was born in Nashville, Tennessee and was an alumna of Fisk University. Work at the Nashville Negro Public Library Andrew Carnegie gave $50,000 to the city of Nashville in 1913 to fund the building of two libraries with the stipulation that funds were to be split equally between a branch for white patrons and another as the first branch in Nashville for African American patrons. At the time, Nashville's library only allowed African Americans to check out books via a bookmobile. Thirty-five people applied for the librarian and assistant librarian positions; the Carnegie Public Library hired Hadley, a twenty-nine-year-old Nashville resident. After accepting the position in the fall of 1915, Hadley moved temporarily to Louisville, Kentucky to take part in a two-month apprenticeship at the Western Colored Branch of the Louisville Public Library under Thomas Fountain Blue. The all-white library board of trustees required that she pay her own train fare and board to attend the training. The Nashville Negro Public Library was opened on February 10, 1916. Nashville Public Library's head librarian, Margaret Kercheval, also provided guidance in running a library to Hadley and Negro branch assistant librarian Hattie Watkins. In her role as librarian, Hadley became \\"a driving force in the Nashville African American community.\\" She was highly respected, with a library administrator writing \\"her work was of the highest order, and in all respects she manifested commendable zeal and interest in whatever she undertook.\\" Hadley served as librarian of the branch for three years before resigning in 1919. After resigning from the library, she became the first executive secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association chapter in Nashville in 1919, helping to establish a local YWCA for African Americans, the Blue Triangle chapter. She returned to the library in the spring of 1921, this time at a salary of $70 per month instead of her previous $60 per month; she worked another two years as the librarian of the Negro Public Library before resigning again. Work at the Chicago Public Library In the 1920s, Hadley moved to Chicago to work for the Chicago Public Library. She was one of a talented group of black women professionals brought to the library by Vivian G. Harsh (CPL's first African American librarian), including Charlemae Hill Rollins and Doris E. Saunders. Hadley worked with Harsh to build the library's Special Negro Collection and promote its use through programming; frequent visitors to that collection included Richard Wright and Langston Hughes. She exchanged a number of letters with W. E. B. Du Bois, who was also a visitor to the collection. Beginning with her time at Fisk University, Hadley had a strong interest in African American history and culture and collected over 1,000 images of African American people and topics. By the 1950s her slide collection was one of the largest in the country on the subject, and she gave talks featuring these images at clubs and churches throughout Chicago. She worked at the Chicago Public Library for almost twenty years, retiring in 1959. After her retirement, Hadley was a founding member of Chicago's Ebony Museum of Negro History and Art, which would later become the DuSable Museum of African American History. Hadley died around 1974.

Each move was controversial. Background and first Prescott capital First Territorial Capital and Governor's Mansion, 1864 After the Gadsden Purchase expanded the New Mexico Territory in 1853, there were several proposals for a division of the territory and the organization of a separate Arizona Territory. No proposal succeeded for a nearly decade until the American Civil War when the southern part of the territory, more under the influence of southern sympathizers, attempted to secede and join the Confederate States of America. The United States Congress then partitioned the territory into the Arizona Territory in the west with New Mexico retaining the eastern part. This had the effect of splitting the area with confederate sympathy. Conflict over the location of the capital began immediately. The bill passed in March 1862 by the United States House of Representatives to create Arizona stipulated that the capital would be in Tucson, located in the southern part of the territory. The final bill, the Arizona Organic Act, passed by the United States Senate in February 1863 and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on February 24, 1863 included no such language. Territorial officials, en route to Arizona in 1863 to establish its government, arrived at Fort Union in New Mexico after a ten-week journey over the Santa Fe Trail. There they discussed a location for the Arizona capital with post commander General James Carleton who argued against Tucson. Carleton felt that although Tucson was the most populous city in the territory, it suffered from strong Confederate and Mexican influences and recommended that the capital be located in the northern Union-controlled area. He suggested the geographic center of the territory where a gold rush was attracting miners to the Walker Mining District. The prior month, Carleton sent troops there to protect the miners. They established Fort Whipple, near present-day Chino Valley. Governor John N. Goodwin heeded the advice and traveled to the fort, arriving on January 20, 1864. Goodwin shortly concluded that the site was too far from the mining settlements on Granite Creek, Lynx Creek, and Hassayampa Creek and too far from timber sources needed for buildings. After a month, Goodwin took a party of 84, including a military escort, to explore the area and search for a better location. He decided to move Fort Whipple south to its present location on Granite creek and establish the territory capital two miles further south in what became Prescott. Goodwin's decision was relayed to General Carleton who agreed and ordered the fort moved. While the Governor had chosen Prescott as the site of the capital, the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature, which met in September 1864, had the authority to move it and considered doing so. Two other locations were proposed, La Paz, along the Colorado River at the state's western border with California, and a new community named Aztlan to be located at the juncture of the Salt and Verde rivers in central Arizona. Efforts to move the capital to either location failed. Tucson The capital remained in Prescott for several years until the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature and Governor Richard C. McCormick moved it to Tucson in 1867. The move was controversial; Prescott residents were angered and accused several members of the legislature of accepting bribes and Governor McCormick of selling his support for the bill in exchange for assistance in his election to become the Territorial Delegate to Congress. No evidence of actual wrongdoing was ever produced and the capital was officially moved on November 1, 1867. Tucson at the time was the most developed city in the territory and it may have been felt that locating the capital there would help reduce Confederate sympathy in the southern part of the territory. The 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1875 voted to make Tucson the \\"permanent\\" capital. Prescott, second tenure The legislature met in the two story building (center) in Prescott (photo ) The capital was in Tucson for only a decade before the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature, in 1877, in its first action and despite the prior legislature's naming Tucson the permanent capital, voted to return it to Prescott effective January 1, 1879. Prescott had considerable political strength at the time, with twelve representatives in the legislature from Yavapai County, while second-place Pima County (the southern home of Tucson) had only seven. The matter of the capital's location was still not settled and was re-visited in the 10th Arizona Territorial Legislature which met in January 1879. A bill was introduced to move the capital to Phoenix in centrally-located Maricopa County, but it died in committee. After reapportionment of the legislative districts per the 1880 census, Pima County had 16 representatives, Maricopa with 5, and Yavapai with 4. The 11th Arizona Territorial Legislature met in January 1881 and considered the issue again. Prescott, although a prosperous mining community, was far from the population centers of the territory (Phoenix and Tucson), was difficult to reach without railroad access, and had harsh winter weather. Bills were introduced to move the capital to Tucson, Phoenix, and \\"at the geographical center of this Territory\\". Tucson argued that Pima County was the ideal location because it had a large population, much mining wealth, was on the Southern Pacific Railroad, and had a favorable climate. Phoenix countered that it was prosperous agricultural area and the population midpoint of the territory. Prescott realized that for it to keep the capital, it would have to counter Tucson and Phoenix by gaining support from other areas. The new town of Tombstone in Pima County wanted to split off as Cochise County with Tombstone as the county seat. The Prescott and Tombstone representatives agreed to support each other as well as to jointly fight a bill that would rescind the \\"Bullion Tax\\" on mined ore that provided significant revenue to those towns. The creation of Cochise County passed with full support of Yavapai County, but the Bullion Tax did not receive full support from the Tombstone delegation, and it was repealed. A bill to move the capital to Tucson passed the lower house but failed in the upper house (then called the council) with the Prescott-Tombstone alliance held together. Proposals for the matter to be decided by a vote of the people, or to be decided by the U.S. Congress both failed to gain support. The next meeting of the legislature was the Twelfth in 1883 where one measure to move the capital to Phoenix died late in the session. 13th Legislature proposals The Thirteenth Legislature of 1885 addressed the issue again. Prior to the legislative session, a group of Tucson businessmen had raised a $5,000 slush fund to lobby for the return of the territorial capital. Before the Tucson delegates, delayed by flooding on the Salt River, forcing a detour through Los Angeles and Sacramento, California could reach Prescott, an alliance of representatives met privately and agreed to keep the capital in Prescott in exchange for support of other items. Proponents of moving the capital centered on the inaccessibility of Prescott in the winter, when it was often necessary to reach Prescott from southern Arizona via Los Angeles. Legislators who traveled that way were reimbursed thirteen cents per mile for up to a 2,200 mile round-trip. The Prescott and Arizona Central Railway was proposed that year to connect Prescott with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad that crossed northern Arizona. A subsidy for construction of $292,000 was approved by the legislature, with the backing of Jerome mining interests including Governor Frederick Tritle. The railroad would be a benefit to the mines, as well as make Prescott more easily reached. Prescott supporters hoped this would end attempts to move the capital elsewhere. Tucson and Phoenix still wanted to host the capital. This legislature was allocating funds for many major projects. There were many rumors about delegations making deals, such as Tucson supporting moving the capital to Phoenix in exchange for receiving an insane asylum. The asylum was put in Phoenix, a normal school (teachers college) went to Tempe (near Phoenix), the territorial prison was kept in Yuma, and a bridge was built across the Gila River in Florence. While the Tucson delegation had been working to move the capital to Tucson, near the end of the session the Tucson Arizona Weekly Citizen said Tucson should have the territory university instead of the capital. A vote to move the capital to Tucson failed with all but one of the alliance members voting \\"nay\\" as pledged. The alliance also succeeded in all their other objectives (preventing a new Sierra Bonita County to be split from Cochise County, keeping the prison in Yuma, not regulating railroad fares) except one, a bill to disfranchise Mormons. A final bill established the University of Arizona in Tucson. 14th Legislature proposals No action was taken in the Fourteenth Legislature of 1887 by Tucson. There was concern by some prominent citizens of Tucson that another attempt could hinder development of the university. This, coupled with the new railroad connection from Prescott to Prescott Junction (now Seligman), caused both Tucson newspapers to advocate keeping the capital in Prescott. However, the Maricopa County member of the Council proposed a bill to move the capital to Phoenix. A Prescott newspaper claimed this was just a ploy to bargain for additional funding for the asylum. Some in Tucson felt Phoenix should be satisfied with the asylum and normal school. In the end, no action was taken. Phoenix Phoenix City Hall, used as the capitol when the capital was first moved to the city The political climate relating to the location of the capital had changed by 1889 when the Fifteenth Legislature met. The southern counties realized that Yavapai County could be defeated if they worked together to move the capital from northern Arizona. The movement centered around Phoenix, with better climate, proximity to the major population centers of the territory, rail connection to the Southern Pacific Railroad. In addition, supporters said Phoenix had better restaurants and hotels, and the City Hall had space to temporarily house the capital functions. Phoenix sought to exchange support with other areas for such things as additional funding for the Yuma prison and Tucson university ($50,000), and the separation of northeastern Yavapai County. It also provided money, as much as $10,000, to influence the votes of southern delegates. Prescott, although vigorously opposed to relocation, had little practical means to resist. Prescott claimed that Tucson supported the move to Phoenix only because they believed Prescott would support a future move to Tucson to avenge Phoenix. Prescott also claimed that by supporting the various appropriations, Phoenix was buying votes (and the capital) with territorial debt. They argued that Prescott should keep the capital since Phoenix and Tucson had the other public institutions, and that Prescott was near the geographic center of the territory and in spite of harsh winters, lacked the desert summers of Phoenix and therefore had a better year-round climate. Tucson supported the move but had sympathy for Prescott, suggesting that the asylum be moved there in exchange. Tucson newspapers noted that the issue had been a \\"disturbing and corrupting element in territorial politics\\" and should be permanently settled. The legislature met in Prescott January 22, 1889 and passed a bill to move the capital to Phoenix in both houses within days before adjourning to resume in Phoenix on February 7. The bill, Legislative Act No. 1, was signed by Governor Zulick on January 26. There were celebrations in Phoenix as the legislators road a special train to Los Angeles and then back to Phoenix. Prescott newspapers alleged bribery by Phoenix and complicity by Governor Zulick. Prescott was even more disappointed because the move was effective immediately instead of January 1, 1891 (the start of the next legislature) which would have been customary. Despite the charges and complaints, Phoenix became Arizona's fourth and final capital. Legends A popular legend about the 1889 vote to move the capital to Phoenix says that the block intending to move held a one-vote lead in the house before the vote. Delegate Charlie Warren of Bisbee engaged a lady of the evening the night before the vote. He supposedly placed his glass eye in a glass of water and later mistakenly swallowed the eye when he awoke thirsty and took a drink. Refusing to appear in public without the eye, he refused to vote which would have kept the capital in Prescott. The prostitute eventually persuaded a friend with a glass eye to loan it to Warren, who then cast the tie-breaking vote to secure the capital for Phoenix. This story cannot be true as there was no one named Charlie Warren in the legislature and furthermore, there was no one-vote margin (13-9 and 9‚Äì2 in the two chambers). In another variation of the tale, attributed to Arizona state historian Marshall Trimble, the legislator was from Yavapai County and the prostitute swallowed the eye at the behest of the Maricopa County legislators. The delegate, whose vote was needed to keep the capital in Prescott, refused to appear causing the bill to pass and the capital to move to Phoenix.

He entered the Royal Engineers in 1923, with appearances in first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team coming in 1925 and 1927. He was taken prisoner by the Japanese following the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941, spending the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war. Following the war he retired from the military in 1948, and later served as a senior administrator for the Tunbridge Wells Hospital Group from 1966 to 1970. Early life and military career The son of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Charles Evans Grose and Ida Macdonald, Grose was born at South Stoneham in Hampshire and was educated at Felsted School. After leaving Felsted he attended the Royal Military Academy, graduating into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in February 1923. In August of that year he played minor counties cricket for Wiltshire, making two appearances in the Minor Counties Championship. He became a lieutenant in February 1925. Grose made his debut in first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1925, with a further appearance in that same year against Oxford University. He made two further first-class appearances against the same opposition in 1927. Across his four matches for the Army, he scored 113 runs with a high score of 35.

Johnson (born 1926) is an American photographer. He is known for his portrayal of society, urban life, and the jazz culture of San Francisco's Fillmore District in the 1940s and 1950s, as well as figures of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Born in Florida under segregation and trained at the California School of Fine Arts, he was the first African American student of photographer Ansel Adams. Johnson's work was largely overlooked until the early 2000s, when his works were featured in a documentary on the history of the Fillmore District. His photographs have since appeared in several books and gallery exhibits, and a selection was purchased by the Library of Congress. His collection is archived in the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley.  Early life  Johnson was born in 1926 in Jacksonville, Florida, and raised by foster parents Alice Johnson (from whom he took his name) and John Henry. He grew up poor in segregated Florida and his foster father was sent to prison when David was four. David was the only person in his household who could read or write. He attended Lewis Grade School and Stanton High School in Jacksonville. He developed an interest in photography as a child after winning a camera in a contest, and his desire to be a photographer was solidified while in high school during a summer trip to Washington D. C. Before finishing high school he was drafted into the U.S. Navy during World War II. He visited San Francisco during his time with the Navy, then was deployed to the Philippines. Upon returning to Jacksonville he read that Ansel Adams had established a fine art photography program at the California School of Fine Arts. With no formal training in photography but equipped with G.I. Bill funds, Johnson wrote to Adams requesting admission to the program, informing Adams he was black. Adams replied that race did not matter, but that the classes were full. After a student dropped out, creating a vacancy, Adams wrote again, inviting Johnson to join the program, and to live with Adams until he found a place to live.  San Francisco  Johnson arrived in San Francisco in 1945, and lived for a time at Adams' home in the Sea Cliff neighborhood, becoming his first black student. Johnson credits Adams with teaching him to visualize a shot before it is taken, and said his interest in documentary photography was sparked by Adams photographing the Japanese internment camps. Johnson became part of the School of Fine Art's \\"Golden Decade\\" (1945‚Äì1955), a group of photography students who trained under noted artists like Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Dorothea Lange and Minor White. Clarence (1947) is considered one of Johnson's signature works. Johnson soon discovered the Fillmore District, a neighborhood that was home to a large majority of the city's rapidly growing African American population. His photographs are some of the only photos of African American life in the Fillmore before urban redevelopment of the 1960s. His subjects included children, community members, activists, and musicians, and he photographed prominent African Americans in politics, society, and civil rights, including Langston Hughes, Thurgood Marshall, Jackie Robinson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Willie Brown. A popular photograph, and one of Johnson's own favorites, is of a 5-year-old boy sitting on the steps of a church. Entitled Clarence, it was the San Francisco Chronicles Picture of the Week in 1947, and the first photograph for which Johnson was paid. Johnson graduated in 1949, and with his wife, Lucy, opened the Johnson Photography Studio in San Francisco's Western Addition neighborhood. He also worked as a post office clerk and as freelance photojournalist with the Sun Reporter and other Bay Area papers. At the post office he became active in the worker's union, and in 1953 became president of the San Francisco chapter of the National Alliance of Postal Employees, a chapter he had helped establish. He became involved with San Francisco politics and the local NAACP chapter, and was sent as a delegate to photograph the 1963 March on Washington. Eventually he was unable to financially sustain his photography business and closed his studio, giving up professional photography while pursuing social and community work. He became involved with the local Republican Party and ran unsuccessfully for San Francisco County sheriff in 1968. Shortly after, he was hired by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where he worked in the personnel department to recruit minority employees. He was a founding member of the UCSF Black Caucus and received the Chancellor's Public Service Award in 1976. He retired from UCSF in 1983, and at age 65 returned to school, earning a master's degree in social work from Barry University in Miami, Florida. He returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and became a social worker for foster families.  Later years  Johnson shows his original folding camera at a 2010 talk In 1999, his daughter encouraged him to submit photographs to a KQED documentary on the history of the Fillmore District. The documentary subsequently included 17 historic photographs of Johnson's, and renewed his photography career. In the summer of 2000, an exhibition of his Fillmore collection was held at Fort Mason and the Center for African and African American Art and Culture. Exhibits of historic and contemporary photographs followed, including showings at California State University, Chico, the University of California, Merced, and galleries in Atlanta and Washington, D. C. He was the recipient of the Certificate of Honor in Photography from Mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom in 2004, and the Fillmore Heritage Pioneer Award in 2011. In 2012 he produced a book, A Dream Begun So Long Ago, written by his wife Jacqueline Annette Sue. He has served as chairman of the Mayor's Committee to Restore Haight Ashbury and as past president of the San Francisco African American Historical & Cultural Society. His name is engraved in the sidewalk of the Fillmore's Gene Suttle Plaza. In 2017, his name was among the contenders to replace the name of San Francisco's Justin Herman Plaza. Johnson considers himself a modern-day \\"griot\\", a story teller, historian and narrator of West African culture. He is still active in photography, although has shifted more towards preserving his legacy, and as of 2015 was working on a project on the black slaves of Sullivan's Island, South Carolina. In 2016 the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley acquired Johnson's archive of some 5,000 negatives and prints, the first collection of an African American photographer to be archived in the library.  Personal life  Johnson had four children with his first wife, Lucy Ellis, who died in 2008. He later married Jacqueline Annette Sue, an author. He was a long-time resident of the Fillmore, and later relocated to Marin County, where he resides in Greenbrae, California.

It is in the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA), Detroit, Michigan, United States. The Diggers is sometimes called Two Diggers among Trees (Dutch: Twee Gravers onder Bomen) to distinguish it from The Diggers (after Jean-Fran√ßois Millet), 1889. Composition The Diggers depicts two men digging up a tree stump in St. Remy, France. The painting shows Van Gogh's relationship with nature and his admiration of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet's work (Millet painted similar scenes). The painting is considered to be of high quality but not among Van Gogh's most valuable paintings. The painting was valued in 2006 at approximately $10‚Äì15 million. Provenance Van Gogh painted The Diggers in 1889, shortly before his death, in Saint-R√©my, France. After his death the painting was owned by Van Gogh's sister-in-law, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In 1907, it was acquired by Garlerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris and then by Frankfurter Kunstverein in 1909. The Diggers was purchased in 1912 by Hugo Nathan, a prominent art collector in Frankfurt, and his wife Martha (Dreyfus) Nathan, and inherited by Martha upon her husband's death in 1922. In 1938, Nathan sold the painting for $9,364 to a consortium of dealers ‚Äì Justin Thannhauser, Alex Ball, and Georges Wildenstein ‚Äì who, in turn, sold it to Detroit collector Robert H. Tannahill in 1941 for $34,000. Tannahill donated the painting, along with over 450 other works of art, to the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the museum took possession upon Tannahill's death in 1970. =Controversy over ownership= In 2014, an ownership dispute began between the Detroit Institute of Arts and fifteen of Martha Nathan's heirs. The heirs claimed that Martha Nathan, a German Jew, was forced to sell the painting (along with Gauguin's Street Scene in Tahiti, owned by the Toledo Museum of Art) under duress and for a lower-than-fair- market price. The heirs wanted the painting returned or for the museum to pay restitution. The museum hired an art provenance specialist to carry out a detailed study of the painting's provenance. According on her report, published by the museum in 2006, Nathan had moved The Diggers to Basel, Switzerland, in 1930, three years before the Nazis came to power. When she left Germany for Paris in 1937, she had paid all applicable exit taxes, without having to sell the painting. Nathan sold The Diggers in 1938 for a price that was consistent with prices of comparable works sold voluntarily in Europe at the time. After the war, when Nathan sought compensation for property sold under duress, The Diggers was not included in the claim. Although the painting was publicly exhibited by the museum with acknowledgment of Nathan's prior ownership, no restitution claim was made by the heirs until 2004. Based on these conclusions, the museum asked the Nathan heirs to recognize the museum's ownership of The Diggers. The heirs, in turn, stated that they would accept a decision made by an independent arbitrator but not one made solely by the museum. When no agreement could be reached, the museum filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 2016, claiming a need to defend their ownership. In 2007, the court ruled against the Nathan heirs. The decision has been criticized by the World Jewish Restitution Organization who stated that the museum had used a statute of limitations defense even though the it had adopted the American Museum Guidelines, set by the American Alliance of Museums, which call for restitution claims to be decided on merit. The museum states that the use of the statute of limitations was a last resort after spending $500,000 on researching the painting's provenance, yet failing to reach agreement with the heirs. Several historians have pointed out that the case against Detroit Institute of Arts is weak compared to other art restitution cases. According to Jonathan Petropoulos, author of The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany, \\"The fact that [Nathan] was able to transport [the painting] to Switzerland, let alone that she did so in 1930, almost three years before Hitler came to power, means that she had freedom of action with regards to the disposition of the works.\\" Similarly, Sidney Bolkosky at University of Michigan-Dearborn stated that while Nathan rightfully received restitution for property seized by the Nazis, the painting was never stolen and it was sold outside of Nazi control.

It was designed for anti-submarine warfare, but was completed too late in the war to be used extensively in that role. The class were designed to be double-ended to confuse submarine observers, and were painted in dazzle camouflage. Kilbride entered service towards the end of the war, and was sold for commercial use in 1920. She was subsequently sold to Italian owners and was sunk by British aircraft in January 1943. Construction and design The Kil class was intended as a patrol and escort ship to equip the Auxiliary Patrol with better sea-keeping and greater endurance and speed than the trawlers that were being used by and then being built for built for the Auxiliary Patrol. Large orders (eventually reaching 85 ships) were placed for the new design of \\"fast trawlers\\" from July 1917. The type was re-classified as a patrol gunboat in January 1918. The ships were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal. The ships had a symmetrical, double-ended hull, with identical bow and stern, in order to make it harder for enemy submarines to estimate the ship's course. They were powered by a single triple-expansion steam engine, with steam supplied from a coal-fired cylindrical boiler. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Design armament was a single 4-inch gun, with at least six depth charges also carried. The ships had a crew of 39 officers and other ranks. Kilbride was launched at Hall Russell's Aberdeen shipyard on 21 August 1918. Mutiny On 13 January 1919, there was a mutiny on board while the ship was docked at Milford Haven. Eight men were court-martialled on charges of non-violent mutiny and sentenced to 90 days and two years hard labour followed by dismissal. Sale and civil use Kilbride was sold on 14 February 1920 to Robinson, Brown & Joplin for conversion to civilian use and resale and was renamed Scotsgap. She was subsequently renamed Rebus and then Poggioreale. By 1930, the ship was registered at Genoa as Nino di Gailura, and she was renamed as Alfredo in 1933, by which time she had been re-engined with an oil engine. Alfredo was torpedoed and sunk by RAF aircraft on 20 January 1943. She remained listed on Lloyd's Register at the start of 1943, but was listed by Lloyds as a War Loss during that year.

It did not prove popular and only one was built. Design and development The Jaworski WJ 3 was a Polish primary glider designed in 1935 and first flown the following year. It was a single seat, open frame (uncovered flat girder fuselage), wooden aircraft, designed to keep costs to a minimum by using the cheapest construction materials and, with no welded joints, to be within the capabilities of basic workshops. It had an undivided wing of rectangular plan mounted on top of the fuselage and built around a single spar, which was the rear part of a torsion-resistant, plywood-covered D box forming the leading edge of the wing. Behind the spar the wing was fabric- covered. A single strut on each side braced the spar to the lower fuselage. Rectangular ailerons reached out to the wing tips. The fuselage was a modified Warren truss, with a curved lower chord or longeron and two additional, near vertical cross-members under the wing. The WJ 3's pilot sat without back support against the foremost of these on an exposed seat mounted on an extension of the lower longeron that also carried the controls. An unsprung, wooden landing skid was attached underneath. Another vertical cross-member formed the rudder-post, reaching above the fuselage. Fabric from this to the nearest diagonal cross-member formed a fin between the longerons. Its near- rectanglar rudder was generous and fabric-covered. A narrow, roughly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron and strut braced to the lower one. It carried an elevator with two tetragonal, fabric-covered surfaces mounted on a common axle, allowing rudder movement between them. Despite the W.J.6's low cost, build-simplicity, low weight, which allowed easy ground transport, and decent handling in flight trials only one was built.

He later returned to British India and was mentioned in dispatches for service in Baluchistan. Collins was with British forces during the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919 and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his actions. From 1932 to 1936 he was a brigadier and commandant of the Indian Military College at Dehra Dun. Early life, cricket and military career The seventh son of Henry Collins, he was born at Reading on 27 November 1878. Collins was educated at Marlborough College, before going up to Keble College, Oxford in 1898. He had debuted in minor counties cricket for Berkshire in 1897, before debuting in first-class cricket for Oxford University against AJ Webbe's XI at Oxford in 1899. He made six further first-class appearances for the university, all of which came in 1899 and gained him a blue. While attending Oxford, he also gained a blue in hockey. After graduating from Oxford, Collins enlisted in the British Army in April 1900 as a second lieutenant in the 6th (militia) battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment. He transferred to a regular army battalion in January of the following year. In October 1901 he was seconded to serve in British India with the Indian Staff Corps, being promoted to lieutenant on 21 December. Collins toured India with a Gurkha Brigade cricket team in February 1904 and three times in ten days made two centuries in the same match. Wisden described the feat as \\"quite without parallel in the history of the game\\". Collins returned to England in 1907, when he played eight first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), including two on their 1907 tour of North America. He also played seven matches for Berkshire in the 1907 Minor Counties Championship. By 1910, he was serving in the 4th Gorkha Rifles and was promoted to captain in March of that year. Collins once again returned to England in the summer of 1910, where he resumed playing first-class cricket. He made one appearance for the MCC against Oxford University, and appeared for the combined Army and Navy cricket team against Oxford and Cambridge Universities at Aldershot, as well as appearing for Berkshire in minor counties cricket. Collins made two final first-class appearances in 1913 for the Free Foresters. Across nineteen first-class matches, he scored 858 runs at an average of 26.81. He made one century, a score of 102 not out against Oxford University in 1910. He played his final minor counties match for Berkshire in the same year, having by that point appeared for the county in 42 Minor Counties Championship matches. WWI and later military career Collins served with the Gurkhas in the First World War, during which he received the Distinguished Service Order in May 1915 for gallantry and devotion to duty during an attack on a German trench during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. He was made a brevet major in June 1916, and was confirmed permanently in the rank in April 1917. He was made a temporary lieutenant colonel while in change of a battalion in May 1917. He returned to British India with the Gurkhas in 1918, where he was mentioned in dispatches during action in Baluchistan. Shortly after the conclusion of the war, he was again made a temporary lieutenant colonel while in change of a battalion in January 1919, but relinquished the rank the following month. Collins served in the Third Anglo- Afghan War of 1919 and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 3 August 1920 for his role in this campaign. He was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel permanently in February 1925. From 1932 to 1936 Collins, then a temporary brigadier, was the first commandant of the Indian Military College at Dehra Dun. He was appointed as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1934 Birthday Honours. In the 1936 Birthday Honours he was made a Companion to the Order of the Star of India. He retired from military service in October 1936, upon which he was granted the honorary rank of brigadier. From 1934 to 1936, Collins was an aide-de-camp to George V, ceasing in the post upon the king's death in January 1936. He died at Fleet, Hampshire, on 28 September 1957. Family Collins married Gladys Lysaght in 1910. The couple had two sons (Peter Rutherford Collins born 1911 and John Humphrey Collins born at Quetta, Indian in 1918) and one daughter Rosemary Emily Collins.

She was wrecked by a storm a couple years later. On December 16, 1996 the remains of Light Vessel No.57 were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Light Vessel No.57 was built in 1891, in Toledo, Ohio by the Craig Shipbuilding Company, at a cost of $14.225. She was one of three federal lightvessels designed for use during the navigational season as an experiment to avoid the construction of a much more expensive permanent lighthouse. Her wooden hull was long, and was built of white oak planks, that were fastened together with 5.8 inch iron spikes. Her beam was wide, and her hull was deep. She also had a gross tonnage of 130 tons, and a net tonnage of 101 tons. She had two masts, and a cluster three oil burning lens lanterns that were hoisted onto each masthead. She had a top speed of eight knots. From 1891 to 1923, Light Vessel No.57 was stationed at Grey's Reef, a ridge of rock 18 miles west of the Mackinac Bridge in northeastern Lake Michigan. Due to the increased ship traffic in the area, it was decided that she would be moved to Gray's Reef to make the area safer. Later history Light Vessel No.57 was retired in 1923. In 1924 she was sold to the South Shore Yacht Club, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was no longer in the federal government's records. Later, she was condemned and dismantled and finally brought to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She lay in Norwegian Alley for several years. In 1928, Light Vessel No.57 was taken to the South Shore Beach, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was used as a clubhouse until she was wrecked by a storm several years later. A November 28, 1926 issue of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Light Vessel No.57 was bought by a junk dealer who \\"removed the pig iron and sold it with all else removable and salable.\\" Wreck of Light Vessel No.57 The remains of Light Vessel No.57 were discovered by divers along the shore, about south off the tip of South Shore Park.

Rider Haggard. Made by the Thanhouser Company, the film was directed by George Nichols and featured his wife Viola Alberti as Amenartes. It starred Marguerite Snow in the title roleShe (1911) - British Film Institute Database and James Cruze in the joint role of Kallikrates and Leo Vincey and was based on a scenario by Theodore Marston.She (1911) - The Devil's Manor: A Clssic horror and Fantasy Film Archive She (1911 - And You Call Yourself A Scientist website Synopsis 'She' has a vision of the approach of Kallikrates The film opens in an outer court of a temple in ancient Egypt in the year 350 B.C. Here Amenartas, the Pharaoh's daughter (Viola Alberti) awaits her love, Kallikrates (James Cruze), who has just become a Priest of Isis. She begs him to leave the priesthood and flee with her from Egypt. Eventually he can resist her entreaties no longer and they escape from the temple. In the desert they meet friendly Arabs who give the weak Kallikrates a camel on which to travel.Review of She - The Moving Picture World (Oct-Dec 1911) After journeying for \\"twice twelve moons\\" they land with their infant son on the East coast of Africa at a point called the Negro's Head. Here lives \\"She Who Must Be Obeyed\\" (Marguerite Snow), the white witch of Africa, who has learned the secret of eternal youth. With her mystic power \\"She\\" sees Kallikrates approach and realises he is the perfect man who must join her by bathing in the fires of eternal youth and with her rule the world. \\"She\\" takes Amenartas and Kallikrates to the mystic flame but when Kallikrates spurns her love \\"She\\" strikes him down dead. Amenartas flees to safety with her infant son, vowing that one day her son or his descendants will return to avenge her husband's death. The body of her dead love is preserved through the generations by \\"She\\", who patiently awaits the return of his reincarnation. Leo Vincey (James Cruze) and Horace Holly (William C. Cooper) open the chart in She Centuries later, in 1885, while \\"She Who Never Dies\\" continues to grieve for her lost love, Horace Holly (William C. Cooper) becomes the guardian of the young English boy Leo Vincey (Marie Eline) on the death of the boy's father. Leo is the descendant of Kallikrates. With the boy comes a mysterious chest and a letter saying the trunk must not be opened before Leo's 25th birthday. 'She' (Marguerite Snow) offers the dagger to Leo Vincey (James Cruze) In 1910 Leo Vincey (James Cruze) is now 25. He and Holly open the chest to discover a letter and a chart; the former entreat them to avenge the death of Kallikrates while the chart shows them the way. The two travel to the East coast of Africa where they see a strange rock, the Negro's Head. \\"She\\" sees Leo approach in a vision; so alike is he to Kallikrates that she believes him to be the reincarnation of her dead love. Leo's boat is stopped by a tribe of natives who blindfold him and Holly lead them into the presence of \\"She‚Äù- who welcomes Leo as her lost love. However, Leo tells \\"She\\" he has come to end her life in revenge for the death of his ancestor. \\"She\\" gives him a knife and baring her bosom bids him to strike, but blinded by her beauty he is unable to do so . After leading Leo and Holly through passageways cut deep into the rock \\"She\\" reveals to Leo the perfectly preserved mummy of Kallikrates. So alike is it to Leo that he believes it actually is himself. \\"She\\" destroys the mummy as she believes she has found her living love. Leading Leo and Holly to the cave which contains the Pillar of Fire that has given her youth for 2,000 years, \\"She\\" entreats Leo to step into the flame so that he too will receive eternal youth and live with her forever. As Leo hesitates ‚ÄúShe‚Äù steps into the flames to calm his fears. However, in the many centuries since ‚ÄúShe‚Äù last stepped into them the nature of the flames has changed and she instantly grows old, until she shrivels into an ape-like creature. Reaching out to Leo and begging him to remember her \\"She\\" dies. Driven nearly mad by what they have just seen, Holly and Leo make their way back to the village. Leaving the strange land they return to England where Leo‚Äôs golden hair turns white with the shock of all he has seen.

Made quickly in a week, probably in November 1911, the film marked Thanhouser's attempt to depict the epic romance of H. Rider Haggard's tale of love across the centuries. Made on a low budget (the characters arrive off the African coast in a row boat!) the film was made with only a dozen or so actors and extras and cheaply painted scenery.

Circa will have a two-story casino, a three-story sportsbook, 777 hotel rooms, five restaurants, and a six-tiered swimming pool area. The property was previously occupied by the Las Vegas Club hotel-casino, the Mermaids Casino, and the Glitter Gulch strip club. Circa is owned by brothers Derek and Greg Stevens, who own other downtown casinos. They purchased the Las Vegas Club in 2015, followed by the acquisition of Mermaids and Glitter Gulch. The three businesses were demolished in 2017, and construction on Circa began in February 2019, with an opening scheduled for December 2020. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, new safety precautions were put in place and the project faced disruptions in its supply chain, both causing an alteration in the construction schedule. As a result, construction on the first five floors was expedited for an early opening on October 28, 2020. The hotel portion is scheduled to open on December 28, 2020. History In August 2015, brothers Derek and Greg Stevens purchased the Las Vegas Club, located at 18 Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada. The Stevens also owned the nearby Golden Gate Hotel and Casino and The D Las Vegas. They closed the Las Vegas Club in August 2015. Derek Stevens initially considered renovating the Las Vegas Club, but he disliked its design and decided to demolish it entirely to build a new resort in its place. In 2016, the Stevens purchased the nearby Mermaids Casino and the Glitter Gulch strip club. The additional property opened new possibilities for a larger version of the Stevens' upcoming resort, and the brothers took additional time to determine specifics about the new project. Mermaids and Glitter Gulch closed later in 2016, with plans to demolish them to make more room for the new resort. That year, Derek Stevens also purchased a 2-acre site across the street from the Las Vegas Club, between the Plaza Hotel & Casino and the Main Street Station. The property would become the site of the new resort's eventual parking garage. The Las Vegas Club, Mermaids, and Glitter Gulch were demolished in 2017. The new resort project was once referred to as \\"18 Fremont\\" because of its address, although the final street address of the resort will be 8 Fremont Street. By May 2018, the project was planned to include a 459-foot-tall hotel, the tallest building in downtown Las Vegas, which raised FAA concerns about height and airspace due to the project's proximity with the North Las Vegas Airport. The new resort, with a height of 459 feet, was approved by the Las Vegas City Council in July 2018. On January 10, 2019, the resort's name was unveiled as Circa Resort & Casino, during a party at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center. The name is a homage to the history of Las Vegas, including past casino builders such as Benny Binion, Jackie Gaughan, Jay Sarno, and Sam Boyd. A video montage explained the resort's name, listing examples of earlier well known Las Vegas properties and their establishment dates and founders, such as, \\"Circa 1941, Jackie Gaughan, El Cortez. Circa 1951, Benny Binion, Binion's Horseshoe. Circa 1966, Jay Sarno, Caesars Palace. Circa 1969, Kirk Kerkorian, International.\\" The video further stated that the announcement of Circa's name would one day be referred to as, \\"Circa January 2019.\\" Other names were considered, including Overland, which was the original name of the Las Vegas Club; and The Mint, which was the name of a former property adjacent to the Las Vegas Club. Circa would be the first new resort to be constructed on Fremont Street since 1980, and was scheduled to open in December 2020. Derek Stevens intended for the resort to be opened prior to 2021 for tax advantages. =Construction= Circa was designed by Steelman Partners. The construction manager was Tr√© Builders, while McCarthy Building Companies Inc. was the general contractor. Construction began in February 2019. The tight size of the property meant that only three days' worth of materials could be delivered at a time. Parts of the resort were prefabricated off-site and then transported to the construction site for integration into the resort. A concrete pour took place in April 2019, with an estimated of concrete. As of June 2019, there were nearly 600 construction workers on the project, including approximately 200 workers on the main property and approximately 40 workers on Garage Mahal. Construction progressed with a continuous schedule. The project began vertical construction that month. Beginning in October 2019, the project had approximately 1,000 construction workers. Three months later, construction reached the 23rd floor. The COVID-19 pandemic occurred during construction, having various effects in Nevada. A Circa construction worker tested positive for COVID-19 in April 2020. Social distancing had been implemented as a safety precaution for COVID-19, and this meant that fewer workers were allowed to work on the upper floors. The construction elevator, normally capable of holding 15 workers, had its capacity reduced to less than five as a pandemic safety measure. The project also faced disruptions in its construction supply chain, another result of the pandemic. Rather than finish the entire resort before opening, the Stevens agreed to a new proposal from the construction team to expedite work on the first five floors, including the casino and pool. The lower floors provided wide-open spaces for social distancing and they were more easily accessible than the upper floors. The Circa hotel tower was topped out on June 19, 2020. During construction, a minor error occurred on the west side of the tower's 30th-floor exterior. Mo Pierce, one of the project engineers, installed a white-colored glass panel in the wrong spot, making it stand out from the rest of the panelling. By mid-2020, the mistake had gained an online following, and Derek Stevens said the misplaced panel was nicknamed as the \\"MoDot\\" and was used as a reference point: \\"(We'd say) plumbing is going on three floors below the MoDot, we're doing this above the MoDot. It became a noun, it became part of our regular vocabulary.\\" =Operation= In June 2020, plans were announced to open the first five floors early, on October 28, while the hotel portion is to open December 28. Derek Stevens also announced that Circa will be an adult-only property, stating that Las Vegas once held \\"a certain mystique as this fabulous place where only grown-ups could play. Call us old-fashioned, but we think adults need some of that mystique back in their lives.\\" The hotel will open without its seven top floors; a decision about completing those will be made a year after the opening. Stevens said that waiting to finish the upper floors would allow time to determine what type of rooms each floor should have: standard rooms or suites. Circa will have 1,500 employees, helping the city amid high unemployment rates caused by the pandemic. Circa is expected to help bring tourism back to the downtown area, away from the Las Vegas Strip. Facilities The Vegas Vickie sign, seen in 2010, will be incorporated into Circa's lobby. The 777-room hotel will have 44 floors, although the top floor will be labeled as \\"60,\\" with some floor numbers being skipped. The resort's lobby will incorporate the former Vegas Vickie cowgirl sign that once advertised Glitter Gulch. Circa will have six bars, including a rooftop lounge known as the Legacy Club, which will honor prominent Las Vegas figures. A cocktail lounge known as Vegas Vickie's will be located in the hotel lobby and will contain the eponymous sign. Circa will also have the state's longest indoor bar, and the longest outdoor bar on the Fremont Street Experience. Circa's nine-story parking garage, known as Garage Mahal, is located across the street from the resort. It will contain 982 parking spaces, artwork, and an air-conditioned skybridge connecting it to the Circa resort. =Gaming= Circa will include a two-story casino, with 1,350 slot machines, 49 table games, and a sportsbook. Circa will heavily focus on sports betting. Its three-story, stadium-style sportsbook is planned as the biggest in Las Vegas and will be a prime aspect of the new resort, unlike other newer resorts in Las Vegas that place less emphasis on sportsbooks. Circa's sportsbook will have seating for 1,000 people. It includes a three- story, high-definition television screen, built at a cost of approximately $20 million. Derek Stevens said that the sportsbook would be the largest in the world, beating out the SuperBook at the Westgate Las Vegas. Stevens' vision for the sportsbook was inspired by his initial visits to the books at Caesars Palace and the Hilton (now the Westgate), both of which he considered impressive. The sportsbook will include the Vegas Stats & Information Network, and Circa is expected to become the center of sports wagering in downtown Las Vegas. In June 2019, Derek Stevens opened sportsbooks at his Golden Gate and D casinos under the name Circa Sports. The Circa resort would house the primary Circa Sports location of the three, and will also offer a Circa Sports betting app. =Stadium Swim= Circa's rooftop pool area is known as Stadium Swim, and is located above the casino. It includes a six-tiered pool area with a 125-foot screen, as well as a DJ booth and two swim-up bars. Sporting events will be primarily shown on the pool's television screen. The pool will be temperature-controlled, allowing it to remain open year-round. Derek Stevens expects the pool to become a top tourist destination, and he envisions the pool as becoming the greatest in the history of the world. =Restaurants= Circa will offer several restaurants, including some operated by people from the Stevens' home state of Michigan. Those restaurants include: * 8 East, an Asian restaurant serving Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese food. * Barry's Downtown Prime, a steakhouse and seafood restaurant by chef Barry Dakake, with an atmospheric setting of 1950s and 1960s Las Vegas. Barry's will be the only part of the resort to allow people under the age of 21. * Project BBQ, an outdoor barbeque restaurant that will feature a food truck fa√ßade. * Saginaw's Delicatessen, serving breakfast specialties and delicatessen options. * Victory, a burger and chicken wing restaurant overlooking the sportsbook.

It was premiered on 24 April 2017 in Madrid. The one-movement Adagio in tempo Lento assai has a duration of approximately forty minutes. Background Initially the Hagen Quartet asked Widmann to compose a clarinet quintet. Widmann's unsuccessful first attempt to write a clarinet quintet was in 2009 and initially abandoned because \\"music history ... suddenly appeared as a great burden\\". The Clarinet Quintet was finally composed in 2017. The work is commissioned by Centro Nacional de Difusi√≥n Musical Madrid, Muziekgebouw Amsterdam, Strijkkwartet Biennale Amsterdam, LuganoMusica, Carnegie Hall, Cit√© de la Musique Paris, Stiftung Mozarteum Salzburg, Philharmonie Essen, and Wigmore Hall. Music The material of the clarinet quintet is reduced to a minimum. A sighing motif of a falling fifth, a direct citation from the final of Brahms's Clarinet Quintet opens the clarinet part. The fifth is a melodic and harmonic (as drone) leitmotif of the whole composition. Another stamping element is a simple three note figure, consisting of one step up and two steps down. It is derived from Mozart's Clarinet Quintet first-movement theme. Special extended techniques are multiphonics, string harmonics, extended bowing techniques, \\"Toppan\\"-Staccato and echo effects.

It served as the high school for black students until the public schools were integrated in 1971. History Tallahatchie Agricultural High School was opened in 1917 for the purpose of educating the negro students of East Tallahatchie County. The interior of the buildings was plastered and finished with red gum, and each room had steam heat, electric lights, and running water. Boarding at the school was provided at cost, with a maximum of $8.00 per month. In addition, students paid the cost of books and a $5.00 matriculation fee. During the depression the school was closed due to lack of funds. In 1970, the federal courts mandated integration of the schools. The school district of East Tallahatchie County attempted to satisfy this requirement by busing entire classes of white children, along with their teachers, from East Tallahatchie to Allen Carver, while transporting a similar number of black students from Allen Carver to Tallahatchie. This allowed the district to maintain completely segregated classrooms but claim that integration had been achieved. Black students protested, so the Tallahatchie County sheriff arrested 125 black students On October 19. The students were incarcerated at the state penitentiary at Parchman, but on October 21, most were released. A Federal judge ordered the school board to meet with the students. While a meeting took place, the school board refused to act on the students grievances, and ridiculed the student representatives. The Community Relations Service (CRS) met with both parties, and in November reached an agreement which allowed the 125 students to return to school, new elections for student council, cheerleaders, and the school's mascot were held. In addition, the classrooms and cafeteria were integrated. The next year high school students attended East Tallahatchie High School and the Allen Carver buildings became Charleston Middle School.

Early life Coster was born in New York and lived at a large home at 103 East 71st Street. He was one of four children born to Charles Robert Coster (1839‚Äì1888) and Marie Bay (n√©e James) Coster (1841‚Äì1904), who were married in 1864. Among his siblings was brother Charles Coster, and sister Elizabeth Mary Coster, who married Alfred Egmont Schermerhorn. His father was a soldier and public official, who is best known for commanding a brigade at the Battle of Gettysburg.Conklin, George W. (1999). Under the Crescent and Star: The 134th New York Volunteer Infantry in the Civil War, p. 31. Axworthy Publishing. . His maternal grandfather was Augustus J. James of Albany, the brother of theologian Henry James Sr., making William's mother Marie a first cousin of author Henry James, psychologist William James, and diarist Alice James. His paternal grandparents were John H. Coster and Sarah Adeline (n√©e Boardman) Coster, making his father a first cousin of fellow New York clubman, Harry Coster. His great-grandfather, John Gerard Coster, came from Haarlem in the Netherlands to the United States shortly after the Revolutionary War and founded the family fortune through the mercantile firm, \\"Henry A. & John G. Coster\\". Career Coster became a stockbroker and opened up an office with his brother Charles and John M. Knapp in 1893. He later transferred his seat to Knapp in 1907, and resigned from the firm. He later became a partner in Morgan Drexel. He was known as a speed walker, who could be seen \\"traversing the sidewalks between the New York Athletic Club and the stock exchange in record time.\\" In 1908, his brother committed suicide \\"after he'd been caught bilking his customers out of millions of dollars.\\" Although William was accused of wrongdoing, and, along with his other siblings, worked out of the same office as Charles, William himself was eventually declared by the New York Stock Exchange to be completely innocent in the debacle. Coster also served in the New York National Guard as the aide de camp of the First Brigade, achieving the rank of captain in 1896. =Society life= In 1892, Coster, one of the best-known bachelor clubmen, was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Coster was a member of the Union Club. Personal life On October 1, 1900, Coster was married to Maria \\"Minnie\\" Griswold Gray (1868‚Äì1947) at St. Saviour's Episcopal Church in Bar Harbor, Maine. Minnie, a close friend of etiquette author Emily Post, was the daughter of Henry Winthrop Gray and Mary (n√©e Travers) Gray, and the granddaughter of William R. Travers. Her parents divorced and her father remarried to Matilda Frelinghuyhsen (daughter of U.S. Secretary of State F. T. Frelinghuysen) in May 1889. Together, William and Maria first lived in New York, then Paris, and became the parents of three children: * Matilda Gray Coster (1901‚Äì1962), who married Stanley Yates Mortimer Jr. (1897‚Äì1984), a grandson of Valentine Hall Jr., nephew of Richard Mortimer, and first cousin of Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1925. They divorced in 1928, and she remarried to Luis Mart√≠nez de las Rivas, in 1932. They later lived in Cuernavaca, Mexico. * Mary Griswold Coster (1903‚Äì1918), who died of pneumonia at age 15. * William Bay Coster Jr. (1908‚Äì1945), who rowed on the Pembroke College crew at Oxford and was an air-raid warden in London during World War II. After living in New York and Paris for many years, Coster died \\"of a long illness, patiently borne,\\" in Bournemouth, England on December 19, 1918. His widow, who lived in Paris at 5 Rue Vaneau, died at her home, 39 East 79th Street in New York, at the age of 79 in July 1947. =Descendants= Through his daughter Matilda, he was the grandfather of Mathilda Coster Mortimer (1925‚Äì1997), Duchess of Argyll. Mathilda was first married to Clemens Heller, founder of the Salzburg Global Seminar, a school in Salzburg, Austria. They divorced in 1962, and in 1963, she remarried to Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll (1903‚Äì1973), following his rather public divorce from Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll. Mathilda and the Duke of Argyll were the parents of one child, Lady Elspeth Campbell, who lived only five days after her birth in 1967.

He was the father of musician Peter Frampton and a teacher of musician David Bowie. Early life Frampton was born in the Kennington district of London, England. His family later lived in other communities, including Sheerness and Beckenham. After the beginning of World War II, he enlisted in the British Army. He became an officer in the Royal Artillery, and participated in the North African Campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily, and the Battle of Monte Cassino. He left the army and returned to Great Britain in 1946. Family In 1941, he married his childhood friend Peggy , to whom he remained married for 64 years, until his death. They had two sons, Peter and Clive. Frampton provided Peter with his first musical instrument, a banjolele that had belonged to his mother (Peter's grandmother). After Peter learned to play that, he gave him the gift of a six-string guitar for Christmas. He also introduced him to the music of Django Reinhardt, which Peter Frampton later cited as being influential to his own musical style. Teaching career In 1946, while taking classes at Beckenham Art School, Frampton began teaching in the art department of Beckenham Technical School, later known as Bromley Technical High School, and currently known as the Ravens Wood School. Besides teaching art, Frampton also taught boxing. His students included David Jones (later David Bowie) and George Underwood, as well as his own sons Peter and Clive. Peter Frampton later reflected on his early interest in performing popular music: > \\"I asked my father, who was head of the art department at the school, who > was into music... ...and he said well there's this David Jones character -- > he seems to play guitar and sax. So it was the three of us [Jones, > Underwood, and Peter Frampton] exchanging licks really -- they taught me > Buddy Holly numbers and I showed them what I knew on guitar --so that's when > our friendship started on those stone steps.\\" Owen Frampton later wrote of his experiences teaching Jones and Underwood in a later (unpublished) autobiography: > \\"David was quite unpredictable. He was completely misunderstood by most of > my teaching colleagues, but in those days, cults were unfashionable and > David, by the age of 14, was already a cult figure. At this period in my > teaching career, I was thoroughly used to very individualistic pupils and > was rarely surprised by anything that occurred. Even when David varied the > colour of his hair or cropped it short, or plucked his eyebrows, I accepted > his actions as a means of projecting his personality, and of that he had > plenty! I did however experience a sense of relief when I obtained > employment for both him and George Underwood in advertising studios and at > the time I thought that probably it would be the last I would hear of either > of them.\\" Another of his students, Aziz Cami, who would go on to co-found a design consulting firm, said of Frampton, \\"The school ‚Äòlosers‚Äô ‚Äì the art stream ‚Äì weren‚Äôt a lost cause for him... ...His ambition to have his secondary school course recognised as an accredited pre-Diploma year by art colleges was uniquely fulfilled in 1967. He achieved this by encouraging a passion for design which involved us designing book jackets, album covers, TV credits, posters, fabrics, ceramics and furniture at the age of 16.\\". Later years After his retirement from teaching at age 60, Owen and Peggy Frampton moved to New York, near Peter's home, but returned to live in England after several years. In the 1970s, Frampton wrote a still-unpublished memoir, Our Way: the Autobiography of a Teacher of Art & Design (The Frampton Papers).

As a member of the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (Society for Women's Suffrage) and Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, she strove to secure enfranchisement for women and worked as an advocate peace. Early years Frederika Wilhelmina Broese van Groenou was born on 1 April 1875 in Djokjakarta, Dutch East Indies, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Jeannetta Emilia (n√©e Wieseman) and Wolter Broese van Groenou. She was the oldest of the seven siblings and her father was serving in the Royal Dutch East Indies Army at the time of her birth. In 1878, he left the military and became director of a sugar company and managed the Tandjong Tirto factory. Broese and her next youngest sister, Miel were sent to live and attend school in The Hague in 1883. The rest of the family joined them there in 1890 and established a household. Wolter continued to manage the Javanese sugar plant from the Netherlands and as a liberal who believed in women's suffrage and world peace, he encouraged his daughters in attaining their education. In 1891, Broese was sent to Allenswood Boarding Academy, an exclusive girls' school in Wimbledon, London. Enrolling in the Haagsche Kookschool (Hague Cooking School) the following year, she took classes there before deciding to obtain her in 1893. Though able to teach school with the certificate, Broese wanted to be an actress and though initially her parents did not approve they finally gave consent. Between 1898 and her graduation in 1900, she attended the Amsterdam Theater School. Career Upon completing her schooling in 1900, Broese adopted the stage name Wilma and debuted in Friedrich Schiller's play Mary Stuart with the Rotterdam Theater Company. She performed with this theater troupe for two years and then switched to the Netherlands Theater Company, where she performed for an additional year. On 12 May 1903, Broese married Jan Richard van Wulfften Palthe, director of industrial textile firm specializing in dying and laundering. Settling in the Van Stolkweg neighborhood of The Hague, Palthe-Broese gave up theater and focused on raising the couple's three sons: \\"Wolter (1905), Richard (1907) and Joachim Adolf (1908)\\". Palthe-Broese's active involvement with women's suffrage began in 1908. Up to that point, she had been apathetic to the cause, but when the International Woman Suffrage Alliance scheduled their 4th conference to be held in Amsterdam, her family donated six hundred guilders (the equivalent of around ‚Ç¨7,000 or $8,000 US in 2016 currency), to provide assistance for foreign attendants' travel expenses and lodging. During the conference, she and her sister Miel, hosted teas for the conventioners and Palthe-Broese met Aletta Jacobs, who would become a close friend for the remainder of her life. After the Conference, Palthe-Broese became dedicated to the cause of women's enfranchisement and joined the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (Society for Women's Suffrage). From 1915, she served as chair of The Hague branch's chapter committee of promulgation and hosted a booth to disseminate information about women's suffrage each Monday in the market near the intersection of the Brouwersgracht and Prinsengracht canals. That same year, she participated in the Women's Conference at The Hague, which occurred between 28 April and 1 May, to protest World War I and develop a plan to prevent war in the future. Palthe-Broese chaired the committee to provide accommodations for those attending the conference and met influential foreign feminists like the Hungarian sisters, Franciska and Rosika Schwimmer. An organization was formed at the conference which would become the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). When the congress ended two delegations of women were formed to meet with European heads state over the next several months. Jane Addams and Jacobs led one group of women while Rosika Schwimmer and Chrystal Macmillan led another. The women who made up the delegations included Palthe-Broese, Emily Greene Balch, Rosa Genoni, Alice Hamilton, Lola Maverick Lloyd, Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann, and Julia Grace Wales and were divided according to whether their countries were involved in the war. Those from countries who were active combatants visited neutral countries and those who were from countries which were neutral visited the governments of countries involved in the war. The women secured agreement from reluctant Foreign Ministers, who overall felt that a mediating body would be ineffective. Nevertheless, they agreed to participate, or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other nations agreed and if President Woodrow Wilson would initiate a body. In the midst of the war, Wilson refused. In 1918, Palthe-Broese used her theatrical talents to present a performance for the Hague chapter of the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht, parodying Parliamentary actions concerning women's suffrage. The following year at the Women's Peace Congress held between 12 and 17 May in Zurich, she was one of the featured speakers, just four months before Queen Wilhelmina signed into law women's right to vote. Shortly thereafter, she and her husband helped Aletta Jacobs move to The Hague and provided her with financial support, as she had lost her earnings due to poor investments. For the remainder of her life, Jacobs was financially supported by Palthe-Broese and her family. Once the suffrage fight was won, Palthe-Broese turned her energies toward the peace movement. She became treasurer of the national branch of the WILPF in 1924. That same year, she helped organize the festivities to celebrate Jacob's 70th birthday. When Jacobs died in 1929, Palthe-Broese was designated as her sole heir. She provided a burial space in her family's mausoleum in Loenen op de Veluwe for Jacobs and worked to create a monument in Driehuis to join Jacobs' remains with her husband, Carel Victor Gerritsen's remains. Gerritsen and Jacobs' remains were reinterred at this monument in in 1931. She continued as treasurer of the Dutch branch of the WILPF until 1940. Death and legacy Palthe-Broese died on 11 November 1960 from leukemia and was buried in the Broese family estate of . As Jacobs' heir, Palthe-Broese donated the papers of Aletta Jacobs to Rosa Manus one of the founders of the International Archives for the Women's Movement. The majority of the papers were looted by the Nazis in 1940 and not returned to the Netherlands until a decade after they were rediscovered in a in Russia in 1992. Jacobs' papers now are housed at the Atria Institute in Amsterdam, as are Palthe-Broese's archival records.

It has been an annual event since 1974. Each year, it features some forty writers from Israel and other countries who take part in events on the Mishkenot campus and other locations in the city. The festival has been organized by Moti Schwartz since 2014.  History The Mishkenot Sha'ananim conference center, founded by The Jerusalem Foundation and situated across from the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, is an international cultural institution and conference center for writers, artists, scholars, and intellectuals from all over the world. Over the years, the center has welcomed writers and hosted literary events with guests from the worlds of music, film, theater, museums, architecture, and other cultural realms. Mishkenot offers programs based on a profound commitment to dialogue, tolerance, and diversity. It provides a platform for cultural exchange in a friendly, pluralistic atmosphere. Mishkenot's residency programs, some of which operate in the framework of the International Writers Festival, host prominent artists from a variety of spheres who spend significant periods of time at the center and draw inspiration from it. For example, in the mid-1970s, Saul Bellow visited Israel and was the guest of Mishkenot. Immersing himself in the landscape and culture of Israel, he recorded the opinions, passions, and dreams of Israelis of varying viewpoints ‚Äì from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to novelist Amos Oz and others. His book To Jerusalem and Back presents his account of his time there.  2020 (Digital Edition)  Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Festival took place in a digital format.

Early life and education Louise Petr√©n was one of twelve children of the vicar of Halmstad. Her father had earned a doctorate in mathematics in 1850, and her great-uncle had been a professor of mathematics at Lund University. One of her brothers was physician and researcher Karl Anders Petr√©n. With two older sisters doing the housework, she was left free to concentrate on her studies. As a child, ill with scarlet fever, she told her family that she would not go to heaven unless she could bring her mathematics books there. She earned an education certificate through private tutoring in 1899, and earned a bachelor's degree at Lund University in 1902, as one of roughly a dozen women at the university and the only one in the sciences. She earned a licenciate in 1910 and defended her doctorate at Lund in 1911, with the dissertation Extension de la m√©thode de Laplace aux √©quations. Contributions Nail Ibragimov writes that Petr√©n \\"made a profound contribution to the constructive integration theory of partial differential equations in the direction initiated by Euler and continued by Laplace, Legendre, Imschenetsky, Darboux, Goursat. In her PhD thesis she extended to higher-order equations Laplace‚Äôs method of integration of second- order linear hyperbolic equations with two independent variables.\\" Later life Petr√©n married Ernest Overton, a professor at Lund, but as a woman could not obtain a position there herself.

Apart from his pioneering work on stemming algorithms and evaluation methods he made other research contributions in the area of Information Retrieval, anaphora resolution and automatic abstracting. , University Trier, DBLP Computer Science Bibliography , ACM Author page, C D Paice  Teaching career  Christopher D Paice was a member of the School of Computing and Communications (SCC) at Lancaster University, United Kingdom for around forty years, initially joining the then Department of Computer Studies as a Research Associate in 1969-70; then moving on to a Lectureship. He was acting Head of Department in 1977-78, Head of Department 1979-82 and retired in 2009., Lancaster University, In Memory of Chris Paice  The Paice-Husk Stemming Algorithm  The Paice-Husk Stemmer was developed by Chris D Paice with the assistance of Gareth Husk in the Computing Department at Lancaster University, in the late 1980s, it features an externally stored set of stemming rules, and this flexibility over the Porter stemmer made it of interest to several researchers., Improvements to the Lancaster Stemming Algorithm (Paice-Husk Stemmer), Antonio Zamora Originally implemented in Pascal programming language, further implementations have been made using ANSI C and Java. A Perl version was implemented by Mary Taffet at the Center for Natural Language Processing at Syracuse University, USA., GitHub, Paice-Husk Stemmer in several languages The stemmer consists of a stemming algorithm and a separate set of stemming rules. The standard set of rules provides a 'strong' stemmer. Stemmer strength is a quality that is advantageous for index compression, however, it produce a larger number of Overstemming errors relative to the number of Understemming errors; users who need a lighter stemmer can easily develop their own set of rules. The Stemmer is iterative (i.e. endings are removed piecemeal in an indefinite number of stages) and the rules may specify the removal or replacement of an ending. The replacement technique avoids the need for a separate stage in the process to recode or provide partial matching; this helps maintain the efficiency of the algorithm. The rules are indexed by the last letter of the ending to allow efficient searching. Stemmer Evaluation Apart from the Stemmer itself, Chris Paice developed a method for directly measuring the performance of stemmers using grouped lists of words applied to the stemmer, counting the number of overstemming and understemming errors, then comparing the results with what would have been obtained by using a set of truncation stemmers.

Since the invention of monolithic integrated circuit (IC) by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, Al interconnects were widely used in silicon (Si) ICs until its replacement by copper interconnects during the late 1990s and early 2000s in advanced process technologies. Al was an ideal material for interconnects due to its ease of deposition and good adherence to silicon and silicon dioxide. Initially, pure aluminum was used, but due to junction spiking, Si was added to form an alloy. Later, electromigration caused reliability problems, and copper (Cu) was added to the alloy. Al interconnects are deposited by physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition methods. They were originally patterned by wet etching, and later by various dry etching techniques.

The primary focus of research at this laboratory is in the fields of nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics, where five accelerators are currently used. It is one of the most important facilities in Italy for research in these fields. The main future project of the laboratory is the Selective Production of Exotic Species (SPES), in which various radionuclides will be produced for research and medicinal purposes. History The establishment of a laboratory in Legnaro was first suggested in 1956 to promote nuclear physics research in Italy in addition to previous work in particle physics. In 1959, the University of Padua decided that a new laboratory would be built near Legnaro, rather than install new equipment in older facilities. The laboratory was founded in 1960 by physicist Antonio Rostagni and research commenced within the next year. After initial investigations demonstrated the conceived role of the Legnaro Laboratories in nuclear physics research, the facility became integrated into the INFN in 1968. In subsequent years, several accelerators were newly installed or upgraded. The original CN accelerator, whose operations commenced with the opening of the laboratory, was upgraded to allow use and study of heavier ions. More advanced facilities were installed in the next decades: the XTU Tandem accelerator in 1981 (inaugurated in 1982) and the Linear Superconducting Accelerator (ALPI) in 1991. The installation of new facilities enabled more advanced studies to be performed at the Legnaro laboratories, increasing its importance in international research in nuclear physics. Currently, most work at the Legnaro National Laboratories involves studies of nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, and gamma-ray spectroscopy; the last was internationally recognized in the 1990s. The recent focus of the Legnaro Laboratories, and the main future project, is SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species). A new accelerator for the production of radioactive ion beams has been under construction since 2007, and the alpha phase of the project, featuring a new cyclotron, was inaugurated in December 2016. Subsequent beta, gamma, and delta phases are planned, approved, and funded by INFN and the Italian government; it will be possible to synthesize new isotopes and mass produce medically useful isotopes once they are completed. Facilities and projects The XTU Tandem accelerator at Legnaro National Laboratories =Accelerators= There are six accelerators in operation at the Legnaro National Laboratories: * CN: installed in 1961. Maximum energy reached for beams was 7 MeV, but nowadays run in 5.5 MeV energy. 7 meter tall (vertically installed) electrostatic accelerator. * AN 2000: installed in 1971, 2 MeV beams. Electrostatic accelerator. * XTU-TANDEM (or TANDEM-XTU): inaugurated 1982. Beam energy few hundred MeV. Electrostatic accelerator. * ALPI (Acceleratore Lineare Per Ioni, Linear Superconducting Accelerator): Started operation in 1991. A superconducting cryogenic linear accelerator. Boosts beams from the TANDEM-XTU and PIAVE accelerators. * PIAVE (Positive Ion Accelerator for Very Low velocity ions): Entered operation in late 2014. Superconducting linear accelerator used as injector to ALPI. A few meters in length. * P70 cyclotron: inaugurated 2 December 2016. Part of the SPES project. All accelerators are used to accelerate various ions for nuclear physics purposes. =AURIGA= The Legnaro National Laboratories are the site of AURIGA, a gravitational wave detector for astrophysical gravitational waves research. It became operational in 2004, and has been continuously in operation since then. In 2016, it was proven that the AURIGA resonant mass detector is sufficiently sensitive for dark matter searches, and perhaps more suitable than more modern detectors such as LIGO. =SPES= The SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species) project involves the construction of several new accelerators specially designed for the production of radioisotopes. In the beta phase, fission at 1013 fissions per second and fragmentation of uranium will be studied to yield exotic neutron-rich isotopes and produce beams with these isotopes at higher intensities than those currently available. These include nuclei near the nuclear drip lines and shell closures that play an important role in the astrophysical r-process. A variety of medically useful radioisotopes will also be mass produced as part of the project's gamma phase. By 2017, significant progress was made on the construction of the SPES facility; the first beams of exotic isotopes are expected to be available in late 2019. =GAMMA experiment= The GAMMA experiment is underway at several European laboratories including the Legnaro National Laboratories. It uses gamma-ray spectroscopy to study the structure of light nuclei, as well as their unbound states and roles in nucleosynthesis processes. At present, LNL is one of the facilities delivering stable ion beams, though the development of SPES will also allow contribution of high- intensity radioactive ion beams. =PVLAS= PVLAS is an axion search experiment.

Training provision Military combat in the Caatinga encompasses the set of techniques for survival and warfare in the semi-arid biome of the Caatinga, which is uniquely Brazilian. The caatinga is an inhospitable environment, found mainly in the Northeast region of Brazil. Military training to operate in the semi-arid operational environment means that Brazil has the capacity to send troops to any region with a similar climate. Brazilian Army soldiers in guidance instruction. Brazilian soldier during night operation. Several units of the Brazilian Army are instructed for caatinga operations. The Operations Training Center in the Caatinga (CIOpC), located in the 72nd Motorized Infantry Battalion in Petrolina (PE), is responsible for providing courses to army military and Military Fire Brigade. The courses offered are the Basic Caatinga Combatant Training Course, lasting one week, the Advanced Stage of Caatinga Combatant and the Caatinga Hunter Stage, both lasting for two weeks. Caatinga snipers The studies related to military operations in the Caatinga are expanding, with the mission of studying, planning and developing a specific operational doctrine for this environment. The caatinga bioma requires a uniform that allows a more efficient action than those normally used by the Brazilian Army, made of more resistant material to allow the movement inside the caatinga without compromising the physical integrity of the troop, besides providing some camouflage. Army fighters wear a khaki-colored denim with leather reinforcement on their arms, legs and chest, to protect the body of the military from contact with thorns, dry branches and stones. In opposition to the kevlar helmet, which concentrates great amounts of heat, causes noise in contact with the shrubs and reflects the light, a hat similar to that adopted by the regional cowboys is used, with a foldable flap and extension to protect the nape of the neck. The coturno is similar to the traditional one, with leather tube, more resistant with the top of canvas. There is a need to use acrylic glasses and leather gloves that protect the back and the palm of the hand but allow the free movement of the fingers. History From its inception in 1995 until 2016, the 72nd Motorized Infantry Battalion stages have taught 6,742 soldiers to survive in the hostile caatinga environment.

It is located at a distance of circa 53 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 1386 is about 50,000 light years across. It is a Seyfert galaxy, the only one in Fornax Cluster.  Observation history  NGC 1386 was discovered by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt on January 19, 1865. Julius Schmidt was then director of the National Observatory of Athens and he was inspecting the Cape catalogue nebulae with a 6 ft refractor. Along with NGC 1386, he also discovered the nearby galaxies NGC 1381, NGC 1382, NGC 1389, and NGC 1428. The publication of their discovery was delayed by 10 years and was published in 1876 with the work √úber einige im Cape-Catalog fehlende Nebel.  Characteristics  NGC 1386 is seen nearly edge-on and it has been classified both as a spiral and as a lenticular galaxy. It features a spiral pattern with dust lanes. No HII regions are visible in the images of the Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies,Sandage, A., Bedke, J. (1994), The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies. Volume I, Carnegie Institution of Washington however HII emission has been detected in the arms. Dust features have also being observed at the central region of the galaxy. Based on observations by the Herschel Space Telescope the total dust mass of NGC 1386 is estimated to be and the stellar mass . The galaxy has two ring structures, with diameters of 0.5 and 1.67 arcminutes. = Active galactic nucleus = NGC 1386 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that has been categorised as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy. It is one of the nearest Seyfert galaxies. The source of nuclear activity in galaxies is suggested to be material accretion around a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. The black hole in the centre of NGC 1386 is estimated to be based on stellar velocity dispersion. The central region of NGC 1386 has three distinct kinematic components. The first has low velocity dispersion (approximately 90 km/s) and is identified as gas rotating in the galaxy disk. The second is observed in the inner 150 pc around the continuum peak and has two components, one redshifted and one blueshifted, which are identified as a bipolar outflow with an outflow rate of 0.1 per year. The third element appears in velocity residual images and could be gas streaming inwards along the spiral. The galaxy disk has elevated emission at the location it intersects with the radiation from the AGN. Observations in 8.4 GHz radio waves by the Very Large Array reveal the presence of a linear radio feature extending to the south of the nucleus and a marginally detectable north extension. The brightest part of the south extension is 0\\".52 from the central source. Ionised gas is detected north and south of the nucleus in a position similar to the radio emission but a comparison with optical images shows no direct association. A linear feature has also been observed by Hubble Space Telescope in [O III] and [N II] + HŒ± with similar characteristics as the radio one. An emission plume extending for one arcsecond east-northeast of the nucleus was also observed. No trace of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission has been detected in mid- infrared observations of the central 20 pc of NGC 1386, while there is mild silicate absorption, which may be associated with a dust torus around the AGN. The Fornax Cluster by VLT Survey Telescope. NGC 1386 can be seen at lower centre left. Observations by BeppoSAX and Chandra X-Ray Observatory suggested that the nucleus of NGC 1386 is obscured by a Compton thick column, with high column density, estimated to be cm‚àí2 as measured by NuSTAR. The observations imply that the torus covers much of the nucleus. The torus obscures much of the soft X-ray spectrum, but harder X-rays, as indicated by the Fe-KŒ± line manage to get through and be observed. NGC 1386 has a corona with faint diffuse soft X-ray emission that appears distorted at its outer parts. NGC 1386 has been found to host a cosmic water maser. It also features a HII region at the circumnuclear region. The border between the narrow-line region that is photionisated by the AGN, and the surrounding HII regions is estimated to be at 6 arcseconds form the nucleus. That corresponds to 310 parsecs at the distance of NGC 1386. A faint, inclined ring of emission extending up to 12 arcseconds from the nucleus can be seen in [N II] + HŒ± images, indicating also the presence of HII regions in the circumnuclear region.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 1386 is considered to be part of the Fornax Cluster. However, the redshift of NGC 1386 is smaller than that of the cluster and this has led to the assumption it is a foreground galaxy. Makarov and Karachentsev grouped NGC 1386 in the NGC 1386 group, along with NGC 1389 and NGC 1396.

The method was originally outlined by Bernie Devlin and Kathryn Roeder in a 1999 paper. It involves using a set of anonymous genetic markers to estimate the effect of population structure on the distribution of the chi-square statistic. The distribution of the chi-square statistics for a given allele that is suspected to be associated with a given trait can then be compared to the distribution of the same statistics for an allele that is expected not to be related to the trait. The method is supposed to involve the use of markers that are not linked to the marker being tested for a possible association. In theory, it takes advantage of the tendency of population structure to cause overdispersion of test statistics in association analyses. The genomic control method is as robust as family-based designs, despite being applied to population-based data. It has the potential to lead to a decrease in statistical power to detect a true association, and it may also fail to completely eliminate the biasing effects of population stratification. A more robust form of the genomic control method can be performed by expressing the association being studied as two Cochran‚ÄìArmitage trend tests, and then applying the method to each test separately.

The Huashui protest began as opposition to pollution from the Zhuxi Chemical Industrial Park (Á´πÊ∫™Â∑•‰∏öÂõ≠), which had been affecting villages in the area since its construction in 2001. After the Dongyang County leadership intervened by sending in officials and police officers to disperse the protesters in what is known as the ‚ÄúApril 10th Incident,‚Äù the protest developed to oppose the local government's repression, too. The protest was notable for its participants, mostly elderly residents of the most seriously affected site Huaxi (Ëä±Ê∫™) No. 5 village, for the theatrical tactics employed by protestors, and for its success in shutting down 11 of the 13 factories in the chemical park.  Background  = October 2001 protest = Construction on the Zhuxi Chemical Industrial Park began in October 2001, with Dongnong Chemical Industry Company (‰∏úÂÜúÂåñÂ∑•), a pesticide factory, set to relocate to land belonging to Huaxi and Huangshan villages. The Huaxi No. 5 village Party secretary opposed this move, writing a pamphlet titled ‚ÄúA portrait of Dongnong Company‚Äù and disseminating it to villagers to inform them of the dangers of Dongnong's pollution to health and environment. Villagers took note of the damaging effects of the factory's pollution in the village of Luzhai and became additionally concerned with the effects of pollution on their families and lineages. In response, they questioned local officials whether Dongnong produced toxic waste, which officials countered by saying that Dongnong met all environmental criteria. Dissatisfied with official responses, villagers forced the Huashui Town Party secretary to walk barefoot around the factory complex and smell the factory waste, and some also vandalized or stole property in what became known as the \\"October 20th Incident.\\" However, this early protest did not stop the relocation of Dongnong to Huaxi and Huangshan territory, and some villagers were prosecuted and imprisoned for disturbing social order. = Zhuxi Chemical Park expansion = The \\"October 20th Incident\\" deterred follow-up protests for the next two and a half years. The Zhuxi Chemical Park expanded to about 960 mu (64 hectares) and included 13 factories, which mainly produced chemicals, pesticides, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. Many of these factories generated substantial air and water pollution; production of weedkillers and defoliators in particular killed much local vegetation and crops. In July 2003, residents of Xishan Village found that their entire green rice field had turned yellow and withered, and many other villagers who relied on agriculture as their main source of income had similar experiences. Many crops affected by pollution were also feared to be poisoned, so villagers in the Huashui Town region were not only unable to sell their cash crops, but were also forced to buy vegetables for personal use from other towns outside the polluted area, causing vegetable prices to surge. = Government policies on land regulation = In China, land-related regulations are more straightforward than environmental laws, and from 2003 to 2004, the central government became more committed to disciplining local governments that had violated such regulations. In December 2003, the central government stipulated that all developmental zones established by county officials or lower-ranking authorities should be shut down, and that lower-level government authorities that complied and carried out \\"self-checking and self-rectification\\" (Ëá™Êü•Ëá™Á∫†) would receive more lenient treatments. Most local governments, including those of Zhejiang province and Dongyang county, complied in order to avoid punishment and nominally revoked the licenses of the illegal industrial parks within their jurisdiction without actually halting factory activity. In April 2004, the Zhejiang provincial government listed the Zhuxi Chemical Park on a list of sites to be shut down, and in July 2004, the Dongyang county government issued documents instructing any illegally seized land to be returned to the Huaxi villagers.  Response  Villagers understood that their 2001 protest on the grounds of environmental pollution had failed, partly because not enough time had passed to prove the definitive relationship between pollution and illness or other health effects. As a result, they petitioned to remove the Zhuxi Chemical Park based on violation of land regulations and ownership rights since the park had been built on illegally seized land. This process included sending representatives to file complaints at government offices in Zhejiang Province and in Beijing, for which villagers fundraised for two years. Later on, villagers used the documents issued by the Zhejiang and Dongyang governments as evidence and fuel for their second round of protests, and during the 2005 action, much of the initial protesting was land-oriented.  Protest  = Events = On March 24, 2005, residents of Huaxi No. 5 village took peaceful direct action against the Zhuxi Chemical Park and set up a tent at the entrance, hoping to block deliveries of supplies to the factories. The following evening, local officials and police dismantled the tent, but the protesters immediately erected a second one, with this process occurring three times. Over the next 10 days, residents of 10 other nearby villages joined in the protest, and each village erected its own tent despite attempts of authorities to pull them down. County leadership then employed a team of 60 people to conduct \\"thought work\\" to influence protesters to leave the encampment. Protesters responded to such repression tactics by pestering the \\"thought workers,\\" calling them traitors acting against the villages' interests, and forcing local leaders to give speeches, then preventing them from leaving until they promised to halt pollution and gave a date for doing so. For most of late March and early April, protesters maintained moderate protest tactics like kowtowing to local officials and police officers, and the protest site became a center of entertainment, drawing many onlookers from nearby villages. Despite the detention of several protest leaders, the number of tents outside the chemical park continued to grow, reaching about two dozen by April 9. At about 3 am on April 10, over 1,500 local officials and public security personnel were sent to dismantle the encampment. The protesters resisted and violence broke out, injuring over 100 officials or police officers and over 200 villagers and damaging 68 government vehicles. One villager recounted that several thousand officials drove up in 60 to 70 vehicles carrying knives, truncheons, and gas canisters. Local reports stated that the violence began after a police vehicle allegedly crushed an elderly woman, and that protesters responded by smashing windows, attacking police officers who had used tear gas, and overturning police cars and buses. = Aftermath = Villagers regarded such repression as excessive when dealing with mostly peaceful, elderly protesters. As a result, protesters turning to more aggressive tactics like mock funerals, big-character posters, interrogations of factory owners, and breaking into the homes of people deemed as traitors to the protest, which became part of an extensive \\"protest spectacle\\". Over 50,000 people from beyond local towns came to the chemical park after the \\"April 10th Incident,\\" according to villager accounts. Many of these onlookers made financial contributions and offered moral support to the protesters, and the presence of such large crowds attracted media and higher level government attention to Huaxi. Pressure from the villagers, central government, and widespread media attention eventually caused the Dongyang county government to close 11 of the factories in the park, and protesters finally took down their tents on May 20. An investigation after the protest revealed that pollution from the park had affected about 11,685 mu (779 hectares) of land in the park's vicinity.  Significance  = Mobilization of elderly protesters = The group of protesters was mainly composed of elderly people, who were chosen as protesters because of their spare time and limited family responsibilities, local legal limitations on detaining individuals over 70 years old, and the general disapproval of state representatives using force on the elderly. Elderly protesters were mobilized by the Societies of Senior Citizens (SSCs) of various villages in Huashui Town. While SSCs are generally non-political organizations focused on community service for the elderly, some SSCs promote economic growth and participate in determining land usage and development projects in their regions. At the time of the Huashui protests, the SSCs of Huashui Town were relatively autonomous from local politics and were able to engage in economic and political activities that other organizations like the Communist Youth League and Public Safety Committee, belonging to the village party committee, could not. Prior to the 2005 protest, the Huaxi No. 5 village SSC worked to fundraise for protesters who had been imprisoned after the \\"October 20th Incident\\" in 2001 and was active in petitioning the local and central government regarding environmental and land rights. During the 2005 protest, the Huaxi No. 5 SSC encouraged elderly villagers to participate in the protests, offered salaries for participating, organized logistics for the protesters, and pressured SSC members that did not join the protest immediately. Additionally, the SSCs from Huaxi, Huangshan, and Xishan provided crucial assistance in recruiting additional participants to the protest from other nearby villages. = Protest tactics = Initially, protesters, who were mostly elderly women, brought various household items and cooking tools to the site to spend their time in the tents eating, sleeping, and socializing. They were instructed by protest leaders not to touch people or cars going into the factories, nor to enter the chemical park. As a form of protest, tent-sitting also attracted many people to the protest site, and after only a few days, the encampment took on the atmosphere of an open-air market with small crowds and food stands Later on, many of the escalated tactics employed by elderly protesters were successful due to their connections to Chinese culture. While kowtowing to younger members of the \\"thought work\\" team, elderly protesters wore white robes, burned incense, chanted \\"We beg you to save us\\" (Ê±ÇÊ±Ç‰Ω†‰πàÊïëÊïëÊàë‰ª¨), and placed handfuls of dirt with incense onto officials' cars. Although these mock funeral proceedings began as ambiguous processes, protesters also held mock funerals specific individuals, like the county party secretary who had approved the repression. His \\"funeral,\\" held on May 5, included big-character posters, an urn, a photograph of him, and burning incense, and attracted more than 10,000 people. These occurrences were regarded as inauspicious, and were perceived as wishing a shortened life on the government officials and police officers. Protesters also used remnants of police uniforms, batons, helmets, shields, knives, tear gas shells, and red armbands from the violence on April 10 to decorate the protest site. These items served as evidence to prove the protesters' stories in the face of contradictory media reports, and also attracted additional spectators and attention to the protest site, adding pressure on the local government to resolve the situation.

She was raised and still resides in Los Angeles, California. Aside from being an artist, Isabel Castro's extensive career includes curatorial work, education, journalism and photography.  Education  Isabel Castro attended Belmont High School. In 1976, she received a bachelor's degree of Fine Arts at USC Roski School of Fine Arts. She also did research at USC Rossier School of Education in 1998 and received her master's degree in Arts Journalism (USC) in 2015.  Artwork  Isabel Castro's ‚ÄúWomen Under Fire‚Äù series (1980) is mixed media, scratched and dyed slides printed on Xerox. The pictures are underdeveloped and the scratched pigments element is strategically placed over the women's faces and bodies to represent the systemic violence imposed on Mexican American women. At the time, forced sterilization was occurring at USC Medical Center in Los Angeles and at an East Los Angeles hospital in the 1970s. The gun targets on the images were strategically placed on each woman to make their bodies targets of stereotypes. The women that posed for the photographs in the ‚ÄúWomen Under Fire‚Äù Series were not survivors of forced sterilization themselves but had family or friends that had been forcibly sterilized. Another artwork by Isabel Castro is \\"X Rated Bondage\\" (1980). The artwork includes six gelatin silver prints.The images depicted are rephotographed images from pornography magazines that illustrate the sexual exploitation of Mexican America women. This exploitation relates to Mexican American women choosing sex work due to systematic racism limiting their career opportunities. Other artwork by Isabel Castro includes \\"Corpus Christi, from M√©chicano 1977 Calendario\\" created in 1976 and is screen print on paper.  Career  = Curator = Isabel Castro's curatorial career began in the late 1990s. Some of her curatorial activities include co-curating ‚ÄúCorridos Sin Fronteras: A New World Ballad Tradition‚Äù, which was an exhibition at the Fowler Museum at UCLA in June 1998. This exhibition was presented again in 2002 with support from the Chicano Studies Research Center, Smithsonian Latino Center and Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services. The \\"Corridos Sin Fronteras\\" exhibition represents the history and celebrates the diversity of Mexican American ballads (corridos). Around the same time, she assisted with the Arhoolie Foundation‚Äôs Strachwitz Frontera Collection project at the Chicano Studies Research Center (CSRC) at UCLA. The Frontera Collection was sponsored by Los Tigres Del Norte fund at UCLA and is the largest digitized collection of Spanish music recorded in the U.S from 1905 to 1955. = Educator = Isabel Castro has served as an executive board member of the Plaza de la Raza Cultural Center for the Arts and Education. She has also worked on \\"Teach and Learn\\" by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. Castro has also contributed to the websites of Newseum and \\"Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage Project\\". = Journalist = Isabel Castro's journalism master's thesis project was the archival \\"Echoes of the Mexican Voice\\" website, as part of the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism's Specialized Journalism program. The project stemmed from the Mexican Voice Collection that documents Mexican American youth culture from 1930 to the 1940s. Parts of the collection are housed in various university libraries, including Charles E. Young Research Library at UCLA.

These migrations were accompanied by a set of domesticated, semi-domesticated, and commensal plants and animals transported via outrigger ships and catamarans that enabled early Austronesians to thrive in the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, Near Oceania (Melanesia), and Remote Oceania (Micronesia and Polynesia), Madagascar, and the Comoros Islands. They include crops and animals believed to have originated from the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures in the hypothetical pre-Austronesian homelands in mainland China, as well as other plants and animals believed to have been first domesticated from within Taiwan, Island Southeast Asia, and New Guinea. Some of these plants are sometimes also known as \\"canoe plants\\", especially in the context of the Polynesian migrations. Domesticated animals and plants introduced during historic times are not included. Plants Domesticated, semi-domesticated, and commensal plants carried by Austronesian voyagers include the following: =Aleurites moluccanus (candlenut)= Candlenut (Aleurites moluccanus) leaves, flowers, and fruit from Maui The candlenut (Aleurites moluccanus) was first domesticated in Island Southeast Asia. Remains of harvested candlenuts have been recovered from archaeological sites in Timor and Morotai in eastern Indonesia, dated to around 13,000 BP and 11,000 BP respectively. Archaeological evidence of candlenut cultivation is also found in Neolithic sites of the Toalean culture in southern Sulawesi dated to around 3,700 to 2,300 BP. Candlenut were widely introduced into the Pacific Islands by early Austronesian voyagers and became naturalized to high volcanic islands. Babulo, Timor-Leste Candlenut has a very wide range of uses and every part of the tree can be harvested. They were primarily cultivated for the high oil content in their nut kernels. They were used widely for illumination, prior to the introduction of other light sources, hence the name \\"candlenut\\". The kernels were skewered on coconut midribs that were then set alight. Each kernel takes about three minutes to burn and thus the series could act as a torch. This tradition of making candlenut torches exist in both Southeast Asia and Oceania. Candlenut oil extracted from the nuts can also be used directly in lamps. They can also be utilized in the production of soaps, ointments, and as preservatives for fishing gear. Other traditional uses include using the timber for making small canoes and carvings; the sap for varnish and resins; the nut shells for ornamentation (most notably as leis), fish-hooks, toys, and the production of black dyes; the bark for medicine and fiber; and so on. Some non-toxic varieties are also used as condiments or ingredients in the cuisines of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word for candlenut is reconstructed as *kamiri, with modern cognates including Hanun√≥'o, Iban, and Sundanese kamiri; Javanese and Malay kemiri; and Tetun kamii. However the Oceanian words for candlenut is believed to be derived instead from Proto-Austronesian *CuSuR which became Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *tuhuR, originally meaning \\"string together, as beads\\", referring to the construction of the candlenut torches. It became Proto-Eastern-Malayo- Polynesian and Proto-Oceanic *tuRi which is then reduplicated. Modern cognates including Fijian, Tongan, Rarotongan, and Niue tui-tui; and Hawaiian kui-kui or kukui. =Alocasia macrorrhizos (giant taro)= Giant taro (Alocasia macrorrhizos) plantation in Tongatapu, Tonga The giant taro (Alocasia macrorrhizos) was originally domesticated in the Philippines, but are known from wild specimens to early Austronesians in Taiwan. From the Philippines, they spread outwards to the rest of Island Southeast Asia and eastward to Oceania where it became one of the staple crops of Pacific Islanders. They are one of the four main species of aroids (taros) cultivated by Austronesians primarily as a source of starch, the others being Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, Colocasia esculenta, and Cyrtosperma merkusii, each with multiple cultivated varieties. Their leaves and stems are also edible if cooked thoroughly, though this is rarely done for giant taro as it contains higher amounts of raphides which cause itching. The reconstructed word for giant taro in Proto-Austronesian is *biRaq, which became Proto-Oceanic *piRaq. Modern cognates for it in Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia include Rukai vi'a or bi'a; Ifugao bila; Ilocano, Cebuano, and Bikol biga; Tiruray bira; Ngaju biha; Malagasy via; Malay and Acehnese birah; Mongondow biga; Palauan b√≠s…ô; Chamorro piga; Bima wia; Roti and Tetun fia; Asilulu hila; and Kowiai fira. In Oceania, cognates for it include Wuvulu and Aua pia; Motu and 'Are'are hira; Kilivila and Fijian via; and Hawaiian pia. Note that in some cases, the cognates have shifted to mean other types of taro. =Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (elephant foot yam)= Elephant foot yam in Taman Negara, Malaysia The elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius) is used as food in Island Southeast Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Its origin and center of domestication was formerly considered to be India, where it is most widely utilized as a food resource in recent times. But a genetic study in 2017 has shown that Indian populations of elephant foot yams have lower genetic diversity than those in Island Southeast Asia, therefore it is now believed that elephant foot yams originated from Island Southeast Asia and spread westwards into Thailand and India, resulting in three independent domestication events. From Island Southeast Asia, they were also spread even further west into Madagascar, and eastwards to coastal New Guinea and Oceania by Austronesians. Though they may have spread south into Australia without human intervention. The elephant foot yam is one of the four main species of aroids (taros) cultivated by Austronesians primarily as a source of starch, the others being Alocasia macrorrhizos, Colocasia esculenta, and Cyrtosperma merkusii, each with multiple cultivated varieties. Elephant foot yam, however, is the least important among the four and was likely only eaten as a famine crop, since they contain more raphides that cause irritation if not cooked thoroughly. =Artocarpus= Numerous species of Artocarpus are traditionally cultivated or harvested from semi-domesticated or wild populations in Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia for food, timber, traditional medicine, and other uses. They include Artocarpus anisophyllus (entawak), Artocarpus heterophyllus (jackfruit or nangka), Artocarpus integer (cempedak), Artocarpus lacucha (lakuch), Artocarpus mariannensis (Marianas breadfruit), Artocarpus odoratissimus (tarap or marang), and Artocarpus treculianus (tipuho), among many others. The most important species pertaining to the Austronesian expansion however, are Artocarpus camansi (breadnut or seeded breadfruit) and Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit). Cempedak (Artocarpus integer) in Malaysia Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) Breadfruit tree in Fatu-Hiva, Marquesas Islands According to DNA fingerprinting studies, the wild seeded ancestor of Artocarpus altilis is the Artocarpus camansi, which is native to New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Philippines. A. camansi was domesticated and selectively bred in Polynesia, giving rise to the mostly seedless Artocarpus altilis. Micronesian breadfruit also show evidence of hybridization with the native Artocarpus mariannensis, while most Polynesian and Melanesian cultivars do not. This indicates that Micronesia was initially colonized separately from Polynesia and Melanesia through two different migration events which later came into contact with each other in eastern Micronesia. Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) in Hawaii The reconstructed Proto- Malayo-Polynesian word for breadfruit is *kulu Ä, which became Proto-Oceanic *kulur and Proto-Polynesian *kulu. Modern cognates include Malay and Sundanese kulur or kelur; Acehnese kulu; Iban kurur; Cebuano kulo or kolo; Muna kula; Mussau ulu; Kapingamarangi gulu; Wayan Fijian kulu; Emae kuro; Tuamotuan, Takuu, and Rarotongan kuru; Tahitian  ªuru; Samoan and Hawaiian  ªulu; and MƒÅori kuru. Note that in MƒÅori, kuru is only mentioned in tradition, but does not refer to the plant because breadfruit did not survive into Aotearoa. Also note that it is believed that breadfruit only reached western Island Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra, Malay Peninsula) during the recent centuries, as a result of trade with the Maluku Islands. Another notable reconstructed word for breadfruit is Proto-Oceanic *maRi or *mai. It is a common root for words for breadfruit in Micronesia, northern and western New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Admiralty Islands, St Matthias Islands, New Caledonia, and parts of the Central Pacific. The term itself may have originally been for Artocarpus mariannensis instead of Artocarpus altilis. Cognates include Pohnpeian, Mokil, and Ngatik mƒÅi; Palauan, Satawal, and Tuvaluan mai; Puluwat mais; Yapese maiyah; and Tongan, Niuean, and Marquesan mei. Artocarpus heterophyllus (jackfruit) The jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) was domesticated independently in South Asia and Southeast Asia, as evidenced by the fact that the Southeast Asian names for the fruit are not derived from the Sanskrit roots. It was probably first domesticated by Austronesians in Java or the Malay Peninsula. The word for jackfruit in Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian is reconstructed as *la≈ãkaq. Modern cognates include Javanese, Malay, Balinese, and Cebuano nangka; Tagalog, Pangasinan, Bikol and Ilocano langka; Chamorro lanka or nanka; Kelabit nakan; Wolio nangke; Ibaloi dangka; and Lun Dayeh laka. Note, however, that the fruit was only recently introduced to Guam via Filipino settlers when both were part of the Spanish Empire. = Bambusoideae (bamboos)= Bamboo forest in Taiwan Various species of bamboo (subfamily Bambusoideae) are found throughout Island Southeast Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia. In Austronesian regions, different types of bamboos have different names, as well as the products made from them. They are used variously as building materials, fishing gear, musical instruments, knives, water and food vessels, and so on. Bamboo shoots are also a food source in Southeast Asia. A few species of bamboo were carried by Austronesian settlers as they colonized the Pacific islands. They include the  ªohe (Schizostachyum glaucifolium), the common bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris), and the thorny bamboo (Bambusa bambos). Reconstructed Proto-Austronesian words that referred to bamboo include *qauR, *kawayan, *buluq, and *betung. The latter entered Proto-Malayo-Polynesian and Proto-Oceanic as *bitung, with cognates including Malay awi bitung; Fijian bitu; and Tongan pitu. Most terms for bamboo in Polynesia, however, originated from Proto-South-Central-Pacific *kofe (originally from Proto-Polynesian *kofe, \\"root\\"). Modern cognates include Tongan and Niue kofe; Tokelau, Marquesan, Tuamotuan, and MƒÅori kohe; Rarotongan ko ªe; Samoan and Tahitian  ªofe; and Hawaiian  ªohe. Some names have also shifted refer to bamboo-like plants; especially in islands where they were not introduced into or did not survive, like in Aotearoa. =Broussonetia papyrifera (paper mulberry)= Kapa cloth being pounded in Maui, Hawaii Paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera), better known as \\"tapa cloth tree\\" in the Pacific, originates from subtropical regions in mainland Asia and is one of the best evidence for the mainstream \\"Out of Taiwan\\" hypothesis of the Austronesian expansion. Various genetic studies have traced the origins of paper mulberry populations in the Remote Pacific all the way to Taiwan via New Guinea and Sulawesi. In the Philippines, which was along the expansion path, paper mulberry are mostly descendants of modern introductions in 1935. It is presumed that ancient introductions of paper mulberry went extinct in prehistory due to its replacement with hand-woven fabrics, given that paper mulberry generally only survives under human cultivation. However, its absence in the Philippines further underlines its origins in Taiwan, and not within Island Southeast Asia. Additionally paper mulberry populations in New Guinea also show genetic inflow from another expansion out of Indochina and South China. Paper mulberry fruits It is believed to be the most widely transported fiber crop in prehistory, having been transported along with the full range of the Austronesian expansion, as opposed to most of the other commensal crops in Oceania. Paper mullbery is present in almost every island or island group in Polynesia, including Rapa Nui and Aotearoa. Some populations have gone recently extinct after they stopped being cultivated, like in the Cook Islands and Mangareva, although accounts and prepared barkcloth and herbarium specimens of them exist in museum collections gathered by Europeans during the Colonial Period. They were spread by Polynesians primarily through vegetative propagation with cuttings and root shoots. They were rarely cultivated from seeds as most plants were harvested prior to flowering, when the stems reach around in diameter, as described by 18th century European accounts. It is also unknown if the feral plants reproduced sexually as the plants are dioecious and require both male and female specimens to be present in one island. Dayak woman pounding barkcloth (likely made from Ficus or Artocarpus spp.) in Borneo, c. 1900 ‚Äì 1938 Paper mulberry is primarily used in the Pacific Islands to make barkcloth (tapa in most Polynesian languages). Barkcloth, can also be made from other members of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including Ficus (figs) and Artocarpus. Barkcloth was also occasionally made from Pipturus nettles, especially in Hawaii. However the highest quality of barkcloth was from paper mulberry. Barkcloth was mainly used for clothing among ancient Austronesians and is traditionally made using characteristic stone or wooden beaters which are among the most common artifacts found in Austronesian archaeological sites. Numerous archaeological remains of barkcloth beaters in southern China has been regarded as evidence that the pre-Taiwan Austronesian homelands were located in the region prior to the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty, particularly around the Pearl River Delta. The oldest such remains is from the Dingmo Site in Guangxi, dated to around 7,900 BP. Barkcloth remained an important source of clothing fabrics in pre-colonial Melanesia, Polynesia, and parts of Indonesia. However, it has been mostly replaced by woven fiber clothing in most of Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia. There are numerous names for paper mulberry throughout Austronesia, the most general can be reconstructed to Proto-Central Eastern Malayo-Polynesian *malaw, which also refers to the loincloth and other items of clothing made from paper mulberry bark. Its cognates including Selaru mal; Asilulu mala ai; Buli mƒÅl; Numfor mƒÅr; Tanga, Tolai, and Gedaged mal; Rennellese mago; Kairiru myal; Lusi, Kove, Manam, Gitua, Mota, Niue, Futunan, Samoan, Tuvaluan, Nukuoro, Anuta, and Hawaiian malo; and Arosi, Rarotongan, and Ma≈çri maro. In Eastern Polynesia, terms for paper mulberry can also be reconstructed to Proto-Central Eastern-Polynesian *aute, with cognates including Tahitian and Rarotongan aute; Marquesan ute; Hawaiian wauke; Rapa and Ma≈çri aute. In most of Polynesia, the term for barkcloth can also be reconstructed from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian *taba, meaning \\"bark\\", with cognates including Wayan taba; Tongan, Samoan, Mangareva, and Rarotongan tapa; and Hawaiian kapa. Other terms widely used for barkcloth and paper mulberry are derived from the Proto-Polynesian reconstructed word *siapo, with cognates including Niue, Tongan, and Marquesan hiapo; and Samoan and East Futunan siapo. The term for barkcloth beater, however, can be reconstructed more extensively back to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ike, with cognates including Uma ike; Sa'a iki; Bauan, Tongan, and East Futunan ike; and Samoan and Hawaiian i ªe. =Calophyllum inophyllum (mastwood)= Mastwood in Wai ªanapanapa, Maui Mastwood (Calophyllum inophyllum) is a widespread timber tree native to tropical Asia. It is notable for its ability to grow to massive sizes in sandy or rocky beaches of island and coastal habitats, as well as its habit of sending out arching large trunks over the water where its seeds are dispersed via the currents. Due to these characters, mastwood are of particular importance to traditional shipbuilding of the larger Austronesian outrigger ships and were carried with them as they migrated to Oceania and Madagascar. Other species of the genus Calophyllum were also used similarly, like Calophyllum soulattri, Calophyllum peekelii, and Calophyllum goniocarpum. The wood grain of the members of the genus are characteristically interlocked, which make them harder to work with but also makes them stronger as well as being more suitable for carving intricate shapes. They were comparable in importance to how oaks were in European shipbuilding and timber industries. In many parts of Polynesia, mastwood groves planted in marae were considered sacred and abodes of spirits. Mastwood were also carved into religious objects like tiki. They are also commonly mentioned in the chants and folklore of Polynesia. mastwood in Beqa, Fiji Various parts of the mastwood were integral to the manufacture of outrigger canoes. The large curving limbs were commonly carved into the dugout canoes that formed the keel of the Austronesian outriggers ships. The strakes, which are attached to the keel by the uniquely Austronesian technique of \\"sewing\\" them with a combination of dowels and lashed lugs instead of nails, can also be made from mastwood, but it is more commonly made from other \\"softer\\" timber species like Artocarpus. Other pieces became masts, outrigger floats, and outrigger spars. Smaller curving limbs can also be carved into the ribs of the boat. Aside from shipbuilding, tamanu oil extracted from the fruit kernels were important in Polynesian culture. The oils, as well as poultices made from leaves and flowers, are also commonly used for traditional medicine. The leaves contain compounds that are poisonous to fish and can be used as fish poison. The reconstructed Proto-Austronesian word for mastwood is *bitaquR, with modern cognates including Ilocano bitt√°ug; Ifugao bit√°ul; Bikol, Cebuano, Maranao, Mansaka and Manobo bit√° ªog or bita ªug; Nias bito; Palauan bt√° ª…ôs; Wetan witora; and Asilulu hataul. The Western Malayo-Polynesian words for mastwood is derived from the doublet Proto-Austronesian *binta≈ãuR, with cognates including Iban, Malay and Toba Batak bintangur or bentangur; Tontemboan wintangor; and Malagasy vint√°no. In Proto-Oceanic, the reconstructed word is pitaquR, with cognates including Nauna pit…®; Loniu pitow; Nali pirow; Seimat hita; Aua pi ªaw; Pohnpeian isou; Rotuman hefau; Fijian vetau, Tongan feta ªu; Niue, Samoan, and Tuvaluan fetau; Nukuoro hedau; and Rennellese heta ªu. In most of these languages, the name specifically refers to C. inophyllum, although in Ifugao, Maranao, Nias, Wetan, and Fijian, the name has become more generalized to large timber trees. Another set of cognates for C. inophyllum in Proto-Oceanic can be reconstructed as *tamanu. Its difference from *pitaquR is unclear, but given the distinction between the terms in the Mussau reflex, *tamanu probably originally referred to specimens of the tree that grow in island interiors and not on the coastlines. Modern cognates include Mussau, Tongan, Niue, Samoan, and Rarotongan tamanu; Fijian damanu; and Hawaiian kamani. =Cocos nucifera (coconut)= Inferred historical introduction of coconuts from the original centers of diversity in the Indian subcontinent and Island Southeast Asia The region between Southwest Asia and Melanesia is the center of origin for coconuts (Cocos nucifera), where it shows greatest genetic diversity. A study in 2011 identified two highly genetically differentiated subpopulations of coconuts, one originating from Island Southeast Asia (the Pacific group) and the other from the southern margins of the Indian subcontinent (the Indo-Atlantic group). The Pacific group is the only one to display clear genetic and phenotypic indications that they were domesticated; including dwarf habit, self-pollination, and the round \\"niu vai\\" fruit morphology with larger endosperm-to-husk ratios. The distribution of the Pacific coconuts correspond to the regions settled by Austronesian voyagers indicating that its spread was largely the result of human introductions. Coconuts in Rangiroa in the Tuamotus, French Polynesia It is most strikingly displayed in Madagascar, an island settled by Austronesian sailors at around 2,000 to 1,500 BP. The coconut populations in the island show genetic admixture between the two subpopulations indicating that Pacific coconuts were brought by the Austronesian settlers that later interbred with the local Indo- Atlantic coconuts. Most words for \\"coconut\\" in Austronesian languages are derived from proto-Malayo-Polynesian *√±iu Ä. Modern cognates include Tagalog niyog; Chamorro niyok; Malay nyiur or nyior; Tetum nuu; Drehu nu; Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan, Fijian, and Rapa Nui niu; and Malagasy nio. Dwarf coconut in Luzon, showing the typical rounder niu vai fruit morphology of Pacific coconuts Genetic studies of coconuts have also confirmed pre-Columbian populations of coconuts in Panama in South America. However, it is not native and display a genetic bottleneck resulting from a founder effect. A study in 2008 showed that the coconuts in the Americas are genetically closest related to coconuts in the Philippines, and not to any other nearby coconut populations (including Polynesia). Such an origin indicates that the coconuts were not introduced naturally, such as by sea currents. The researchers concluded that it was brought by early Austronesian sailors to the Americas from at least 2,250 BP, and may be proof of pre-Columbian contact between Austronesian cultures and South American cultures, albeit in the opposite direction than what early hypotheses like Heyerdahl's had proposed. It is further strengthened by other similar botanical evidence of contact, like the pre-colonial presence of sweet potato in Oceanian cultures. During the colonial era, Pacific coconuts were further introduced to Mexico from the Spanish East Indies via the Manila galleons. In contrast to the Pacific coconuts, Indo-Atlantic coconuts were largely spread by Arab and Persian traders into the East African coast. Indo-Atlantic coconuts were also introduced into the Atlantic Ocean by Portuguese ships from their colonies in coastal India and Sri Lanka; first being introduced to coastal West Africa, then onwards into the Caribbean and the east coast of Brazil. All of these introductions are within the last few centuries, relatively recent in comparison to the spread of Pacific coconuts. =Colocasia esculenta (taro)= Taro fields in Hanalei Valley, Kaua'i The taro (Colocasia esculenta), sometimes referred to as the \\"true taro\\", is one of the most ancient cultivated crops and pre-dated the Austronesian expansion. Taro is found widely in tropical and subtropical regions of South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, and northern Australia and is highly polymorphic, making taxonomy and distinction between wild and cultivated types difficult. It is believed that they were domesticated independently multiple times, with authors giving possible locations as New Guinea, Mainland Southeast Asia, and northeastern India, based largely on the assumed native range of the wild plants. However, more recent studies have pointed out that wild taro may have a much larger native distribution than previously believed, and wild breeding types may also likely be indigenous to other parts of Island Southeast Asia. Auckland, New Zealand Taro corms being sold in the Philippines Archaeological traces of taro exploitation have been recovered from numerous sites pre-dating the Austronesian expansion, though whether these were cultivated or wild types can not be ascertained. They include the Niah Caves of Borneo, dating to <40,000 BP; Ille Cave of Palawan, dated to at least c. 11,000 BP; Kuk Swamp of New Guinea, dated to 10,200 to 9,910 cal BP; and Kilu Cave in the Solomon Islands dated to around c. 28,000 to 20,000 BP. In the case of Kuk Swamp, there is evidence of formalized agriculture emerging by about c. 10,000 BP, with evidence of cultivated plots, though which plant was cultivated remains unknown. A taro plantation in Palau using dug pits and compost to create richer soil Regardless, taro were definitely among the cultivated plants of Austronesians as well as preceding populations in Island Southeast Asia. However, their importance in Island Southeast Asia had largely been replaced by rice, although they are still planted at the margins of rice paddies in some communities. They remained a staple in the islands of Melanesia and Polynesia where rice wasn't introduced. They are one of the four species of aroids (taros) cultivated by Austronesians primarily as a source of starchy corms, the others being Alocasia macrorrhizos, Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, and Cyrtosperma merkusii. They are the most important and the most preferred among the four, because they were less likely to contain the irritating raphides present in the other plants. Taro is also identified as one of the staples of Micronesia, from archaeological evidence dating back to the pre-colonial Latte Period (c. 900 - 1521 AD), indicating that it was also carried by Micronesians when they colonized the islands. Due to the unsuitability of the low-lying atoll islands of most of Micronesia, Micronesians innovated by digging pits that could then be filled up with compose suitable for taro cultivation. Taro pollen and starch residue have also been identified in earlier Lapita sites, dated to around c. 3,050 - 2,500 cal BP. There are numerous terms for taro in the Austronesian languages, both specific and generalized. The reconstructed Proto-Austronesian term for taro is *cali, with cognates in Formosan languages including Seediq sali, Thao lhari; Bunun tai; and Amis tali. It became *tales in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, which in turn became *talos or *talo in Proto-Oceanian. Modern cognates include Hanun√≥'o t√°lus; Aborlan Tagbanwa talis; Palawan Batak t√§l√§s; Nias tal√µ; Minangkabau talas; Rejang and Sundanese taleus; Javanese tales; Palauan d√°it; Rotinese tale; and Tetun talas. In Polynesian languages, the cognates include Motu, Marovo, Tongan, Samoan, Niue, Futunan, Tuvaluan talo; Kwaio, Lau (Malaita), and Toqabaqita alo; 'ƒÄre'ƒÅre, Arosi, and Bauro aro; Nakanamanga na- tale; Sye tal or nal; Fijian and Nukuoro dalo; Rennellese tago; Anuta, Rarotongan, and MƒÅori taro; and Hawaiian kalo. The English name for the plant is itself derived from the Polynesian names. A red variety of taro also has names derived from reconstructed Proto-Polynesian *pongi, with cognates including Niue pongi; Marquesan poki; Hawaiian poni; and MƒÅori pongi. In Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian, another reconstructed term is *kaladi, with cognates including Agutaynen, Sabah Bisaya, Iban, Tae', and Wolio kaladi; Balinese and Malay keladi; and Mongondow koladi. =Cordia subcordata (beach cordia)= Flowering beach cordia in O ªahu The beach cordia (Cordia subcordata) is an important timber tree with light, finely textured, and somewhat soft wood ideal for carving. It has no taste and thus was most commonly used for carving utensils, cups, bowls, and other containers; as well as ornamental carvings and musical instruments throughout Austronesia. The wood is flammable and is commonly used in New Guinea as firewood. In some cultures, the wood may also be used to build paddles and the keels of the boats. The seeds can also be eaten, though only as famine food. Other parts can also be used for traditional medicine and for the extraction of dyes. Like Calophyllum inophyllum, beach cordia were commonly planted in marae. They have cultural and religious significance in some cultures like in Kiribati and the Karimunjawa Islands of Indonesia. In Hawaii, it was traditional to plant beach cordia around houses and use their bright orange flowers as leis. Beach cordia, like most trees favored by Austronesians, grow well in sandy, clay, and rocky soil and are a common component in coastal forests and mangrove forests. Beach cordia was once thought to be an introduced species, but it is now known to be indigenous to most of the islands and coastlines of the Indo- Pacific, propagated naturally by their buoyant seeds. Nevertheless, they were still deliberately introduced in some islands, with artificial introductions usually found growing with other common trees cultivated by Austronesians. Especially in the atolls of Micronesia. Terms for beach cordia is reconstructed to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *kanawa, with cognates including Iban kenawa; Makasarese kanawa; Palauan k…ôl√°u; Gilbertese kanawa; Tokelau kanava; and Nukuoro ganava. Another set of cognates can be reconstructed to Proto- Oceanic *toRu, with cognates including Nehan to-tor; Petats to-tol; Fijian, Tongan, and Rarotongan tou; and Hawaiian kou. An older reconstructed term is Proto-Austronesian *qaNuNa≈ã, however it is not specific to beach cordia and can refer to other members of the genus with sticky fruits, especially the glue berry (Cordia dichotoma) and the lasura (Cordia myxa). It also did not reach the Oceanic languages. Cognates include Tsou h…ôhng…ô; Isneg an√∫nang; Hanun√≥'o and Cebuano an√∫nang; Maranao nonang; Manobo enunang; Mansaka anonang; Malay, Minangkabau, Sasak, Manggarai, and Rembong nunang; and Mongondow onunang. =Cordyline fruticosa (ti)= Red ti plants in R√©union Ti (Cordyline fruticosa) is a palm-like plant growing up to tall with an attractive fan-like and spirally arranged cluster of broadly elongated leaves at the tip of the slender trunk. It has numerous color variations, ranging from plants with red leaves to green, yellow, and variegated cultivars. Its original native distribution is unknown, but it is believed to be native to the region from Bangladesh, to Mainland Southeast Asia, South China, Taiwan, Island Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Northern Australia. It has the highest morphological diversity in New Guinea and is believed to have been extensively cultivated there. It is commonly misidentified as a \\"Dracaena\\", along with members of the genus Cordyline, due to past classification systems. ti in Singapore It was carried throughout Oceania by Austronesians, reaching as far as Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island at their furthest extent. A particularly important type of ti in Polynesia is a large green-leafed cultivar grown for their enlarged edible rhizomes. Unlike the ti populations in Southeast Asia and Near Oceania, this cultivar is almost entirely sterile in the further islands of eastern Polynesia. It can only be propagated by cuttings from the stalks or the rhizomes. It is speculated that this was the result of deliberate artificial selection, probably because they produce larger and less fibrous rhizomes more suitable for use as food. Ti has many uses but it is most notable as one of the most important plants related to the indigenous animist religions of Austronesians, along with fig trees (Ficus spp.). It is very widely regarded as having mystical or spiritual powers in various Austronesian (as well as Papuan) cultures. Among a lot of ethnic groups in Austronesia it is regarded as sacred. Common features include the belief that they can hold souls and thus are useful in healing \\"soul loss\\" illnesses and in exorcising against malevolent spirits, their use in ritual attire and ornamentation, and their use as boundary markers. Red and green cultivars also commonly represented dualistic aspects of culture and religion and are used differently in rituals. Red ti plants commonly symbolize blood, war, and the ties between the living and the dead; while green ti plants commonly symbolize peace and healing. They are also widely used for traditional medicine, dye, and ornamentation throughout Austronesia and New Guinea. Their ritual uses in Island Southeast Asia have largely been obscured by the introduction of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islamic, and Christian religions, but they still persist in certain areas or are coopted for the rituals of the new religions. In Polynesia, the leaves of the green-leafed form are used to wrap food, line earth ovens and fermentation pits of breadfruit, and their rhizomes harvested and processed into a sweet molasses-like pulp eaten like candy or used to produce a honey-like liquid used in various sweet treats. In Hawaii, the roots are also be mixed with water and fermented into an alcoholic beverage known as okolehao. Fibers extracted from leaves are also used in cordage and in making bird traps. The consumption of ti as food, regarded as a sacred plant and thus was originally taboo, is believed to have been a daring innovation of Polynesian cultures as a response to famine conditions. The lifting of the taboo is believed to be tied to the development of the firewalking ritual. Red ti planted alongside traditional houses of the Ifugao people in the Banaue Rice Terraces, Philippines In Philippine anitism, ti were commonly used by babaylan (female shamans) when conducting mediumship or healing rituals. A common belief in Filipino cultures is that the plant has the innate ability to host spirits. Among the Ifugao people of Northern Luzon, it is planted around terraces and communities to drive away evil spirits as well as mark boundaries of cultivated fields. The red leaves are believed to be attractive to spirits and is worn during important rituals as part of the headdresses and tucked into armbands. In the past, it was also worn during ceremonial dances called bangibang, which was performed by both men and women for warriors who died in battle or through violent means. They are also used to decorate ritual objects. Among the Palaw'an people, it is planted in burial grounds to prevent the dead from becoming malevolent spirits. Toraja houses in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi Feral green ti plants in Makawao Forest, Maui In Indonesia, red ti are used similarly as in the Philippines. Among the Dayak, Sundanese, Kayan, Kenyah, Berawan, Iban and Mongondow people, red ti are used as wards against evil spirits and as boundary markers. They are also used in rituals like in healing and funerals and are very commonly planted in sacred groves and around shrines. The Dayak also extract a natural green dye from ti. During healing rituals of the Mentawai people, the life-giving spirit are enticed with songs and offerings to enter ti stems which are then reconciled with the sick person. Among the Sasak people, green ti leaves are used as part of the offerings to spirits by the belian shamans. Among the Baduy people, green ti represent the body, while red ti represent the soul. Both are used in rice planting rituals. They are also planted on burial grounds. Among the Balinese and Karo people, ti plants are planted near village or family shrines in a sacred grove. Among the Toraja people, red ti plants are used in rituals and as decorations of ritual objects. They are believed to occur in both the material and the spirit worlds (a common belief in Austronesian animism). In the spirit world, they exist as fins and tails of spirits. In the material world, they are most useful as guides used to attract the attentions of spirits. The red leaves are also symbolic of blood and thus of life and vitality. Among the Ngaju people, ti plants were symbolic of the sacred groves of ancestors. They were also important in ritual promises dedicated to high gods. They were regarded as symbolic of the masculine \\"Tree of Life\\", in a dichotomy against Ficus species which symbolize the feminine \\"Tree of the Dead\\". Flowering green ti plant in Tonga In New Guinea, ti are commonly planted to indicate land ownership for cultivation and are also planted around ceremonial men's houses. They are also used in various rituals and are commonly associated with blood and warfare. Among the Tsembaga Maring people, they are believed to house \\"red spirits\\" (spirits of men who died in battle). Prior to a highly ritualized (but lethal) warfare over land ownership, they are uprooted and pigs are sacrificed to the spirits. After the hostilities, they are re-planted in the new land boundaries depending on the outcome of the fight. The men involved ritually place their souls into the plants. The ritual warfare have been suppressed by the Papua New Guinea government, but parts of the rituals still survive. Among the Ankave people, red ti is part of their creation myth, believed as having arisen from the site of the first murder. Among the Mendi and Sulka people they are made into dyes used as body paint, and their leaves are used for body adornments and purification rituals. Among the Nikgini people, the leaves have magical abilities to bring good luck and are used in divination and in decorating ritual objects. Among the Kapauku people, ti plants are regarded as magical plants and are believed to be spiritual beings themselves. Unlike other magical plants which are controlled by other spirits, ti plants had their own spirits and are powerful enough to command other spiritual beings. Red plants are used in white magic rituals, while green plants are used in black magic rituals. They are also commonly used in protection and warding rituals. Among the Baktaman people, red plants are used for initiation rites, while green plants are used for healing. The Ok-speaking peoples also regard ti plants as their collective totem. In Island Melanesia, ti are regarded as sacred by various Austronesian-speaking peoples and are used in rituals for protection, divination, and fertility. Among the Kwaio people, red ti are associated with feuding and vengeance, while green ti are associated with ancestor spirits, markers of sacred groves, and wards against evil. The Kwaio cultivate these varieties around their communities. Among the Maenge people of New Britain, ti leaves are worn as everyday skirts by women. The color and size of leaves can vary by personal preference and fashion. New cultivars with different colors are traded regularly and strands of ti are grown near the village. Red leaves can only worn by women past puberty. Ti is also the most important plant in magic and healing rituals of the Maenge. Some ti cultivars are associated with supernatural spirits and have names and folklore around them. In Vanuatu, Cordyline leaves, known locally by the Bislama name nanggaria, are worn tucked into a belt in traditional dances like MƒÅ ªulu ªulu, with different varieties having particular symbolic meanings. Cordylines are often planted outside nakamal buildings. In Fiji, red ti leaves are used as skirts for dancers and are used in rituals dedicated to the spirits of the dead. They are also planted around ceremonial buildings used for initiation rituals. Hula dancers in a Luau in LƒÅhainƒÅ, in traditional kƒ´ leaf skirts In Micronesia, ti leaves are buried under newly built houses in Pohnpei to ward off malign sorcery. In instances of an unknown death, shamans in Micronesia communicate with the dead spirit through ti plants, naming various causes of death until the plant trembles. There is also archaeological evidence that the rhizomes of the plants were eaten in the past in Guam prior to the Latte Period. Pu ªu Moaulanui heiau (temple) in the summit of Kaho ªolawe, Hawaii In Polynesia, green ti were cultivated widely for food and religious purposes. They are commonly planted around homes, in sacred places (including marae and heiau), and in grave sites. The leaves are also carried as a charm when traveling and the leaves are used in rituals that communicate with the species. Like in Southeast Asia, they are widely believed to protect against evil spirits and bad luck; as well as having the ability to host spirits of dead people, as well as nature spirits. Ti leaf bundles (puolo) used as offerings to spirits in Hawaii In ancient Hawaii the plant was thought to have great spiritual power; only kahuna (shamans) and alii (chiefs) were able to wear leaves around their necks during certain ritual activities. Ti was sacred to the god of fertility and agriculture Lono, and the goddess of the forest and the hula dance, Laka. Ti leaves were also used to make lei, and to outline borders between properties. It was also planted at the corners of the home to keep evil spirits away. To this day some Hawaiians plant ti near their houses to bring good luck. The leaves are also used for lava sledding. A number of leaves are lashed together and people ride down hills on them. The leaves were also used to make items of clothing including skirts worn in dance performances. The Hawaiian hula skirt is a dense skirt with an opaque layer of at least fifty green leaves and the bottom (top of the leaves) shaved flat. The Tongan dance dress, the sisi, is an apron of about 20 leaves, worn over a tupenu, and decorated with some yellow or red leaves. In Aotearoa, certain place names are derived from the use and folklore of ti, like Puketƒ´ Forest and Temuka. The ti plants in Kaingaroa are known as nga tƒ´ whakƒÅwe o Kaingaroa (\\"the phantom trees of Kaingaroa\\"), based on the legend of two women who were turned into ti plants and seemingly follow people traveling through the area. The reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word for ti is *siRi. Cognates include Malagasy s√≠ly; Palauan sis; Ere and Kuruti siy; Araki jihi; Arosi diri; Chuukese tii-n; Wuvulu si or ti; Tongan sƒ´; Samoan, Tahitian, and MƒÅori tƒ´; and Hawaiian kƒ´. The names in some languages have also been applied to the garden crotons (Codiaeum variegatum), which similarly have red or yellow leaves. The cognates of Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian *sabaqa≈ã, similarly, have been applied to both garden crotons and ti plants. In the Philippines, they are also known by names derived from the Proto-Austronesian *kilala, \\"to know\\", due to its use in divination rituals. Cognates derived from that usage include Tagalog sagilala; and Visayan and Bikol kil√°la or kilaa. In New Zealand, the terms for ti were also transferred to the native and closely related cabbage tree (Cordyline australis), as tƒ´ k≈çuka. =Cyrtosperma merkusii (giant swamp taro)= Giant swamp taro plantation in Butaritari, Kiribati. =Dioscorea (yams)= Yams (Dioscorea spp.) is a very large group of plants native throughout tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Various species of yams were domesticated and cultivated independently within Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea for their starchy tubers, including the ube (Dioscorea alata), round yam (Dioscorea bulbifera), intoxicating yam (Dioscorea hispida), lesser yam (Dioscorea esculenta), Pacific yam (Dioscorea nummularia), fiveleaf yam (Dioscorea pentaphylla), and pencil yam (Dioscorea transversa). Among these, D. alata and D. esculenta were the only ones regularly cultivated and eaten, while the rest were usually considered as famine food due to their higher levels of the toxin dioscorine which requires that they be prepared correctly before consumption. D. alata and D. esculenta were the most suitable for long transport in Austronesian ships and were carried through all or most of the range of the Austronesian expansion. D. alata in particular, were introduced into the Pacific Islands and New Zealand. They were also carried by Austronesian voyagers into Madagascar and the Comoros. Dioscorea alata (ube) Ube (Dioscorea alata) from the Philippines where the dominant cultivated variety is vividly purple The ube (Dioscorea alata), also known as the greater yam or water yam, is one of the most important staple crop in Austronesian cultures. It is the main species cultivated among Dioscorea, largely because of its much larger tubers and its ease of processing. Its center of origin is unknown, but archaeological evidence suggests that it was exploited in Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea before the Austronesian expansion. Ube is believed to be a true cultigen, only known from its cultivated forms. It is a polyploid and is sterile, and thus can not cross bodies of water. This restricts its introduction into islands purely by human agency, making them a good indicator of human movement. Some authors have proposed an origin in Mainland Southeast Asia without evidence, but it shows the greatest phenotypic variability in the Philippines and New Guinea. Ufi (Dioscorea alata) vine in Vava ªu, Tonga Based on archaeological evidence of early farming plots and plant remains in the Kuk Swamp site, authors have suggested that it was first domesticated in the highlands of New Guinea from around 10,000 BP and spread into Island Southeast Asia via the Lapita culture at around c. 4,000 BP, along with D. nummularia and D. bulbifera. In turn, D. esculenta is believed to have been introduced by the Lapita culture into New Guinea. There is also evidence of an agricultural revolution during this period brought by innovations from contact with Austronesians, including the development of wet cultivation. Uhi (Dioscorea alata) in Maui However, much older remains identified as being probably D. alata have also been recovered from the Niah Caves of Borneo (Late Pleistocene, <40,000 BP) and the Ille Cave of Palawan (c. 11,000 BP), along with remains of the toxic ubi gadong (D. hispida) which requires processing before it can be edible. Although it doesn't prove cultivation, it does show that humans already had the knowledge to exploit starchy plants and that D. alata were native to Island Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it opens the question on whether D. alata is a true species or cultivated much older than believed. Ube remains an important crop in Southeast Asia. Particularly in the Philippines where the vividly purple variety is widely used in various traditional and modern desserts. It also remains important in Melanesia, where it is also grown for ceremonial purposes tied to the size of the tubers at harvest time. Its importance in eastern Polynesia and New Zealand, however, has waned after the introduction of other crops, most notably the sweet potato. The reconstructed Proto-Austronesian word for ube is *qubi, which became Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qubi, and Proto-Oceanic *qupi. It has some of the most recognizable and widespread reflexes in Austronesian languages. Modern cognates include Yami uvi; Itbayaten ovi; Bontoc and Hanun√≥'o √∫bi; Ilocano, Tagalog, Cebuano, Pangasinan, Aklanon, Itneg, and Itawis √∫bi or √∫be; Kalamian Tagbanwa kubi; Maranao obi; Tiruray ubi; Manobo uvi; Kenyah, Malay, Iban, Balinese, Sasak, Mongondow, and Toba Batak ubi; Javanese uwi; Kelabit ubih; Melanau ubey; Ngaju Dayak owi; Malagasy √≥vy; Tsat phai; Jarai hebey; Moken koboi; Sundanese huwi; Tontemboan, Bimanese, and Manggarai uwi; Ngadha uvi; Rotinese ufi; Erai uhi; Selaru uh or uhi-re; Watubela kuwi; Buruese ubi-t; Koiwai uf; Buli up; and Waropen uwi. Among Oceanic languages, cognates include Nauna kuh; Penchal kup; Leipon uh; Tolai up; Lakalai la-huvi; Gapapaiwa and Kilivila kuvi; Papapana na-uvi; Simbo, Bugotu, and Nggela, and Fijian uvi; Kwaio, Niue, and Samoan ufi; Sa'a, Arosi, Tuamotuan, Hawaiian and Rapa Nui uhi; Marquesan puauhi; Haununu a-uhi; Avava 'o-ovi; Rennellese uhi; Tongan ufi; Anuta upi; Rarotongan ui; and MƒÅori uwhi or uhi. In some ethnic groups, the word has been generalized or shifted to mean other types of yams, as well as the sweet potato and cassava. Other words for ube are also derived from the ancestral names of other species of yam. Dioscorea bulbifera (air yam) D. bulbifera in Indigenous Flowers of the Hawaiian Islands (Frances Sinclair, 1885) The air yam (Dioscorea bulbifera), also known as the bitter yam, is one of the lesser cultivated species of yam. It is usually only eaten as famine food in Island Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and Polynesia, because of the toxicity of some wild or feral plants when not cooked correctly. However it is one of only three yams that were carried by Austronesians into Remote Oceania, the others being D. alata and D. nummularia. The part of the plant harvested are the aerial tubers, as it does not usually produce large underground tubers. It can be reconstructed to Proto-Oceanic as *pwatika or *p ∑atik, with cognates including Lou puet; Lamusong patik; Boanaki posika; and Kwara'ae fasia. However, in Lamusong its meaning has shifted to the lesser yam, while in Boanaki, the meaning has shifted to a more generalized term for yams. It can also be reconstructed to the more generalized Proto-Oceanic *balai, meaning \\"wild yam\\", which became Proto-Micronesian *palai, with cognates including Rotuman parai; Tongan, Niue, and Samoan palai; and Rennellese pagai. Dioscorea esculenta (lesser yam) Dioscorea esculenta in Botanischer Garten der Universit√§t Karlsruhe The lesser yam (Dioscorea esculenta) is the second most important yam crop among Austronesians. Like D. alata, it requires minimal processing, unlike the other more bitter yam species. However, it has smaller tubers than D. alata and is usually spiny. Like D. alata it was introduced to Madagascar and the Comoros by Austronesians, where it spread to the East African coast. They are also a dominant crop in Near Oceania, However, it did not reach to the furthest islands in Polynesia, being absent in Hawaii and New Zealand. Starch grains identified to be from the lesser yam have been recovered from archaeological sites of the Lapita culture in Viti Levu, Fiji, dated to around 3,050 to 2,500 cal BP. Traces of D. esculenta (along with D. alata, D. bulbifera, D. nummularia and D. pentaphylla) yams have also been identified from the M√© Aur√© Cave site in Moindou, New Caledonia, dated to around 2,700 to 1,800 BP. Remains of D. esculenta have also been recovered from archaeological sites in Guam, dated to around 1031 CE. D. esculenta is believed to have been introduced by the Lapita culture into New Guinea at around 4,000 BP, along with agricultural innovations like wet cultivation as well as swidden farming. In archaeological sites in New Guinea, it is associated with the appearance of high-density populations in the coastal areas. Terms for lesser yam in Austronesian languages are mostly affixed or two-word forms derived from the *qubi root for D. alata, like Samoan ufi lei, Javanese ubi gemblii, Sundanese ubi aung, and Malay ubi torak. A term for lesser yam can be reconstructed in Proto-Philippine as *tugiq, but its cognates are limited to the island of Luzon, including Ivatan togi; Ilocano and Kankana-ey tug√≠; Bontoc and Ifugao tugi; and Tagalog tugi. No Proto-Oceanic term can be reconstructed for the lesser yam because it is absent in Remote Oceania. However, it can be reconstructed in Proto-Western-Oceanic as *kamisa, *qamisa, or *mamisa. Dioscorea hispida (intoxicating yam) The intoxicating yam (Dioscorea hispida), is native to tropical Asia and New Guinea. It is only cultivated minimally in parts of Java. Elsewhere it is harvested from the wild. Like D. bulbifera it has toxic tubers that need to be prepared correctly before they can be eaten, and thus were only suitable for famine food. However, it is one of the Dioscorea species identified from the Niah Caves archaeological site dating to <40,000 BP. Its names can be reconstructed to Proto-Western-Malayo- Polynesian *gadu≈ã. Its modern cognates in most Western Malayo-Polynesian languages is gadung or gadong (also ubi gadung or ubi gadong). The names are also applied to the similarly toxic introduced cassava. =Ficus (fig trees)= =Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato)= =Lageneria siceraria (bottle gourd)= =Morinda citrifolia (noni)= Noni fruits and flowers in Bulacan, Philippines Noni (Morinda citrifolia) is native to Southeast Asia extending to New Guinea and northern Australia. It grows readily in beach and rocky environments. It has been introduced widely into the Pacific. All parts of the plant were used by Austronesians for traditional medicine and timber, but its most common traditional use is for the extraction of red or yellow dyes. The odor of the plant and the fruit was also traditionally believed to repel evil spirits. The fruit is also edible, but is usually only eaten as famine food. There are several terms for noni that can be reconstructed. The most widespread is Proto-Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian *√±…ô√±u. Cognates include Kapampangan lino; Tagalog and Bikol n√≠no; Cebuano nin√∫; Gedaged nanom or nonom; Takia nom; Bimanese nonu; Tetun nenu-k; Leti and Asilulu nenu; Leti (Moa) nienu; Wetan neni. It became Proto-Oceanic *√±o√±u, with cognates including Nali non; Leipon and Wogeo √±o√±; Bipi √±oy; Gitua and Rarotongan nono; Gilbertese non; Motu, Tongan, Niue, Futunan, Samoan, Tuvaluan, Kapingamarangi, Nukuoro, and Anuta nonu; and Hawaiian noni (from which the English name is derived from). In some languages the meaning has shifted to mean \\"small tree\\" or \\"shrub\\" or to the closely related Morinda umbellata and Morinda bracteata. In Western Malayo-Polynesian, another term that can be reconstructed is Proto- Western Malayo-Polynesian *ba≈ãkudu, which may have referred to a different species of Morinda originally. Its cognates including Tagalog and Cebuano bangk√∫ro; Agutaynen bangkoro; Tausug, Toba Batak, and Balinese bangkudu; Sundanese cangkudu; Sasak bengkudu; and Mongondow bongkudu. There are also smaller cognate sets, like Proto-Philippine *apatut for the tree and Proto- Oceanic *gurat and *kurat for the red dye produced from the tree. =Musa (bananas)= Iholena bananas in Maui, Hawaii The earliest domestication of bananas (Musa spp.) were initially from naturally occurring parthenocarpic (seedless) individuals of Musa acuminata banksii in New Guinea, before the arrival of Austronesian-speakers. Numerous phytoliths of bananas have been recovered from the Kuk Swamp archaeological site and dated to around 10,000 to 6,500 BP. From New Guinea, cultivated bananas spread westward into Island Southeast Asia through proximity (not migrations). They hybridized with other (possibly independently domesticated) subspecies of Musa acuminata as well as Musa balbisiana in the Philippines, northern New Guinea, and possibly Halmahera. These hybridization events produced the triploid cultivars of bananas commonly grown today. From Island Southeast Asia, they became part of the staple crops of Austronesian peoples and were spread during their voyages and ancient maritime trading routes into Oceania, East Africa, South Asia, and Indochina. Fe'i bananas in Tahiti These ancient introductions resulted in the banana subgroup now known as the \\"true\\" plantains, which include the East African Highland bananas and the Pacific plantains (the Iholena and Maoli- Popo'ulu subgroups). East African Highland bananas originated from banana populations introduced to Madagascar probably from the region between Java, Borneo, and New Guinea; while Pacific plantains were introduced to the Pacific Islands from either eastern New Guinea or the Bismarck Archipelago. A second wave of introductions later spread bananas to other parts of tropical Asia, particularly Indochina and the Indian Subcontinent. Musa abaca (abac√°) Abac√° (Musa textilis), also known as Manila Hemp, is grown traditionally for its fiber in the Philippines. It was once one of the world's premier fibers, valued for its use in soft, lustrous, and silky fabrics. It was a major luxury export of the Philippines during the Colonial Era, and was introduced to Hawaii and Central America by Europeans. It has since been replaced by synthetic fibers like rayon and nylon. Musa √ó troglodytarum (fe'i banana) Fe'i bananas (Musa √ó troglodytarum), also spelled Fehi or F√©i, are banana cultivars unique to Melanesia, the Maluku Islands, and Polynesia. Unlike other domesticated banana cultivars which are derived from Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, fe'i bananas are believed to be hybrids derived from entirely different species. Proposed progenitors of fe'i bananas include Musa jackeyi, Musa lolodensis, Musa maclayi, and Musa peekelii, all of which are native to New Guinea and surrounding islands. Like other bananas, they were spread eastwards to Polynesia for use as food. However, they are absent in Island Southeast Asia, reaching only as far as the Maluku Islands. =Oryza sativa (rice)= Map of the Neolithic China (8,500 to 1,500 BC) Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most ancient Austronesian staples, and is likely to have been originally domesticated by their ancestors long before the Austronesian expansion. It remains the main crop plant cultivated in Island Southeast Asia. There are two most likely centers of domestication for rice as well as the development of the wetland agriculture technology. The first, and most likely, is in the lower Yangtze River, believed to be the homelands of early Austronesian speakers and associated with the Kauhuqiao, Hemudu, Majiabang, and Songze cultures. It is characterized by typical Austronesian innovations, including stilt houses, jade carving, and boat technologies. Their diet were also supplemented by acorns, water chestnuts, foxnuts, and pig domestication. Ifugao hogang, guardian spirits carved from tree fern trunks overlooking the Banaue Rice Terraces of Luzon The second is in the middle Yangtze River, believed to be the homelands of the early Hmong-Mien-speakers and associated with the Pengtoushan and Daxi cultures. Both of these regions were heavily populated and had regular trade contacts with each other, as well as with early Austroasiatic speakers to the west, and early Kra-Dai speakers to the south, facilitating the spread of rice cultivation throughout southern China. The spread of japonica rice cultivation to Southeast Asia started with the migrations of the Austronesian Dapenkeng culture into Taiwan between 5,500 and 4,000 BP. The Nanguanli site in Taiwan, dated to ca. 4,800 BP, has yielded numerous carbonized remains of both rice and millet in waterlogged conditions, indicating intensive wetland rice cultivation and dryland millet cultivation. Latte stone pillars (haligi) from Hag√•t√±a, Guam From about 4,000 to 2,500 BP, the Austronesian expansion began, with settlers from Taiwan moving south to colonize Luzon in the Philippines, bringing rice cultivation technologies with them. From Luzon, Austronesians rapidly colonized the rest of Island Southeast Asia, moving westwards to Borneo, the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra; and southwards to Sulawesi and Java. By 2,500 BP, there is evidence of intensive wetland rice agriculture already established in Java and Bali, especially near very fertile volcanic islands. However, rice (as well as dogs and pigs) did not survive the first Austronesian voyages into Micronesia due to the sheer distance of ocean they were crossing. These voyagers became the ancestors of the Lapita culture. By the time they migrated southwards to the Bismarck Archipelago, they had already lost the technology of rice farming, as well as pigs and dogs. However, knowledge of rice cultivation is still evident in the way they adapted the wetland agriculture techniques to taro cultivation. The Lapita culture in Bismarck reestablished trade connections with other Austronesian branches in Island Southeast Asia. The Lapita culture also came into contact with the non-Austronesian (Papuan) early agriculturists of New Guinea and introduced wetland farming techniques to them. In turn, they assimilated their range of indigenous cultivated fruits and tubers, as well as reacquiring domesticated dogs and pigs, before spreading further eastward to Island Melanesia and Polynesia. Rice, along with other Southeast Asian food plants, were also later introduced to Madagascar, the Comoros, and the coast of East Africa by around the 1st millennium CE by Austronesian sailors from the Greater Sunda Islands. Much later Austronesian voyages from Island Southeast Asia succeeded in bringing rice to Guam during the Latte Period (1,100 to 300 BP). Guam is the only island in Oceania where rice was grown in pre-colonial times. =Pandanus (pandanus)= Woman using pandanus leaves in traditional weaving (lauhala) in Moloka'i, Hawaii (c. 1913) Pandanus (Pandanus spp.) are very important cultivated plants in the Pacific, second only in importance and pervasiveness to coconuts. Every part of the plant is utilized, including for food, building materials, traditional medicine, and fiber and weaving materials in various cultures in Austronesia. The plants (particularly the fragrant flowers) also had spiritual significance among the native animist Austronesian religions. Crab claw sail woven from pandanus leaves on a tepukei, an ocean‚Äëgoing outrigger canoe from Temotu, Solomon Islands Pandanus were also profoundly crucial in enabling the Austronesian expansion. Their leaves were traditionally woven into mats used in the sails for Austronesian outrigger ships. Sails allowed Austronesians to embark on long-distance voyaging. In some cases, however, they were one-way voyages. The failure of pandanus to establish populations in Rapa Nui and Aotearoa is believed to have isolated their settlements from the rest of Polynesia. The word for pandanus in Austronesian languages is derived from Proto-Austronesian *pa≈ãudaN, which became Proto-Oceanic *padran and Proto-Polynesian *fara, the latter two usually referring specifically to Pandanus tectorius. Cognates in modern Austronesian languages include Kanakanavu pang…ôtan…ô; Thao and Bunun panadan; Tagalog pandan; Chamorro pahong; Ratahan pondang; Malay pandan; Manggarai pandang; Malagasy fandrana; Lau fada-da; Fijian vadra; Samoan fala; Tongan fƒÅ; Tahitian fara; Hawaiian hala; and MƒÅori whara or hara. Note that among the Formosan languages of Indigenous Taiwanese, the meaning of the words have largely shifted to mean \\"pineapple\\", a physically similar non-native European- introduced plant. In MƒÅori, as well, the meaning has shifted to Astelia spp. and Phormium tenax (harakeke), similar plants used for weaving, since pandanus did not survive the voyage into Aotearoa. Pandanus tectorius with fruit in Beqa, Fiji Pandanus grow well in island habitats, being very salt-tolerant and easy to propagate, making them ideal plants for early Austronesian sailors. Like coconuts, they grow predominantly along strandlines, mangrove forests, and other coastal ecosystems. They can also be found in the understory of forests in larger islands. Others may also be found in highland groves, likely planted by humans. Both pandanus and coconuts are adapted to withstand the strong winds of the frequent typhoons of the Indo-Pacific. The greatest center of diversity of Pandanus is the western Pacific and Island Southeast Asia. The genus has around 600 species, but the most important and the most widespread group of species in Austronesian cultures and is the Pandanus tectorius complex. Philippine basket woven from leaves of karagumoy (Pandanus simplex) in the hexagonal kinab-anan pattern Pandanus tectorius in Oceania show evidence of long cultivations, with hundreds of different selectively bred cultivars which are primarily propagated through cuttings. These varieties often have different names in local languages and have different physical characteristics. The varieties are predominantly distinguished by the color and edibility of their fruit, but they may also be differentiated based on other criteria like the color and shape of their leaves used for weaving. Very old fossils of Pandanus tectorius have been recovered from Hawaii, dated to more than 1.2 million years old. This indicates that the plants once colonized Hawaii (and likely the rest of the Pacific islands) naturally through their buoyant fruits. However, useful domesticated varieties were carried by Austronesians from island to island. Especially since wild pandanus have calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) in their fruit tissue. They cause itchiness and irritation when eaten raw and thus need to be cooked. Domesticated varieties which have less raphides (which are also usually less fibrous and more nutritious), were therefore valued . It is thus considered both native and introduced. There are also fossil evidence of pandanus fruits being harvested for food in New Guinea from archaeological sites dated to around 34,000 to 36,000 BP. Other important species of pandanus utilized by Austronesians include Pandanus amaryllifolius, Pandanus odorifer, Pandanus furcatus, Pandanus julianettii, Pandanus simplex, Pandanus utilis, Pandanus dubius, and Pandanus whitmeeanus, among many others. Pandanus odorifer is widespread in the region from western Micronesia, to Island Southeast Asia and South Asia. It is possibly a subspecies of Pandanus tectorius and they hybridize readily. Pandanus amaryllifolius, the pandan, is another important species widely used as a spice in the cuisines of Southeast Asia for their vanilla-like fragrant leaves. =Piper (peppers)= Peppers (Piper) ancestrally cultivated by Austronesians include the betel (Piper betle), cubeb pepper (Piper cubeba), kava (Piper methysticum), and the Javanese long pepper (Piper retrofractum). Many others were also harvested from the wild for medicinal or religious purposes, including Piper caducibracteum, Piper excelsum, Piper ornatum, and Piper sarmentosum. Black pepper (Piper nigrum) and long pepper (Piper longum) were also extensively cultivated in Island Southeast Asia after early contact by Austronesian traders with South India and Sri Lanka. Piper betle (betel) Betel vine The betel (Piper betle) is one of the two plants that comprise the main ingredients of betel chewing, the other being the areca nut (Areca catechu). It is one of the most ubiquitous practices of the Austronesians. It is consumed by taking a leaf of betel, wrapping it around an areca nut and some lime (obtained from grinding seashells), and then chewing it for some time. It is a stimulant, inducing slight dizzines followed by euphoria and alertness. It is also highly addictive, damages the teeth and gums, and stains the teeth red. A betel mortar from Manam Motu, c. 1680 to 1890 CE Based on archaeological, linguistic, and botanical evidence, betel chewing is most strongly associated with Austronesian cultures, despite its widespread adoption by neighboring cultures in prehistoric and historic times. The original range of betel is unknown, but Areca catechu is known to be originally native to the Philippines, where it has the greatest morphological diversity as well as the most number of closely related endemic species. It is unknown when the two were combined, as areca nut alone can be chewed for its narcotic properties. In eastern Indonesia, however, leaves from the wild Piper caducibracteum (known as sirih hutan) are also harvested and used in place of betel leaves. The oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines. Specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of Palawan island dated to around 4,630¬±250 BP . The dentition of the skeletons are stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes Anadara shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in Bohol dated to the first millennium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian term *buaq originally meaning \\"fruit\\" came to refer to \\"areca nut\\" in Proto-Malayo- Polynesian, it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the Austronesian expansion (~5,000 BP). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of Austronesia. East Sumba, Kingdom of Kapunduk, early 20th century It reached Micronesia at around 3,500 to 3,000 BP with the Austronesian voyagers, based on both linguistic and archaeological evidence. It was also previously present in the Lapita culture, based on archaeological remains from Mussau dated to around 3,600 to 2,500 BP. But it did not reach Polynesia further east. It is believed that it stopped in the Solomon Islands due to the replacement of betel chewing with the tradition of kava drinking prepared from the related Piper methysticum. It was also diffused into East Africa via the Austronesian settlement of Madagascar and the Comoros by around the 7th century. The practice also diffused to the cultures the Austronesians had historical contact with. It reached South Asia by 3,500 BP, through early contact of Austronesian traders from Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula with the Dravidian-speakers of Sri Lanka and southern India. This also coincides with the introduction of Southeast Asian plants like Santalum album and Cocos nucifera, as well as the adoption of the Austronesian outrigger ship and crab-claw sail technologies by Dravidian-speakers. It Mainland Southeast Asia by 3,000 to 2,500 BP through trade with Borneo, as well as the settlement of the Champa polities in southern Vietnam. From there, it was spread northwards into China. Lastly, it reached Northern India by 500 BP through trade in the Bay of Bengal. From there it was spread westwards into Persia and the Mediterranean. There are very old claims of betel chewing dating to at least 13,000 BP at the Kuk Swamp site in New Guinea, based on probable Areca sp. recovered. However, it is now known that these might have been due to modern contamination of sample materials. Similar claims have also been made at other older sites with Areca sp. remains, but none can be conclusively identified as A. carechu and their association with betel peppers is tenuous or nonexistent. There are numerous cognate sets reconstructible in Austronesian languages relating to various aspects of betel chewing. Ranging from chewing something without swallowing to equipment used to climb areca nut palms to the betel spittle. One cognate set that can be reconstructed for betel pepper is Proto-Western Malayo-Polynesian *Rawed which became Proto- Philippine *gawed, with cognates including Yami gaod, Itbayaten gawed; Ilocano gaw√©d; Isneg khaw√°d; Casiguran Dumagat gaw…ôÃÅd; and Ibaloy kawed; Balangaw law…®'d; Kalagan law√≥d; and Kenyah auat or awet. Two other cognate sets reached into Oceania. The first is Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *pu-pulu, which became Proto-Oceanian *[pu-]pulu. Cognates include Mussau ulo; Loniu pun; Bipi pun or puepun; Lukep ul; Takia ful; Gedaged fu; Manam ulusalaga; and Bugotu vu-vulu. The other is Proto-Meso-Melanesian *siqa(r,R)(a), with cognates including Kara and Lihir sie; Tabar sia; Patpatar sier; Tolai ier; Nehan hiara; Petats sil; Teop hia(kuru); Tinputz (ta)sian; Banoni si…£ana; and Marovo hirata. Piper cubeba (cubeb pepper) The cubeb pepper (Piper cubeba) are native to Island Southeast Asia. Like Piper retrofractum, however, it was only cultivated extensively in the Greater Sunda Islands for the spice trade. The Javanese protected the monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the seeds before trading them. It has a pungent smell, often compared to allspice, quite unlike that of the other culinary peppers. It also has a slightly bitter taste. It is notable as having reached as far as Greece during ancient times via the Silk Road. It was a valuable rare spice in Medieval Europe and the Middle East, reputed to have medicinal and magical properties. Medieval Arab physicians commonly used it for a range of treatments, ranging from treating infertility to poison antidotes. It is mentioned in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights as well as in the travelogues of Marco Polo. Its trade waned during the Colonial Era when the Portuguese Empire banned its importation to promote the black pepper produced by its own colonies. Piper excelsum (kawakawa) Kawakawa in Auckland, New Zealand Kawakawa (Piper excelsum) is a small tree or shrub endemic to New Zealand and nearby Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. It was exploited by Austronesian settlers based on previous knowledge of the kava, as the latter could not survive in the colder climates of Aotearoa. The MƒÅori name for the plant, kawakawa, is derived from the same etymon as kava, but reduplicated. It is a sacred tree among the MƒÅori people. It is seen as a symbol of death, corresponding to the rangiora (Brachyglottis repanda) which is the symbol of life. Boughs of kawakawa are often used in purification rituals. However, kawakawa's resemblance to true kava is only superficial. Kawakawa roots do not have psychoactive properties. Instead, kawakawa's primary use is for traditional medicine. Piper methysticum (kava) Kava (Piper methysticum) is a small tree or shrub believed to have been domesticated in either New Guinea or Vanuatu by Papuans. It is believed to be a domesticated variety of Piper subbullatum which is native to New Guinea and the Philippines. Traditional kava preparation ceremony in Fiji Kava plant in Maui It was spread by Austronesians after contact into the rest of Polynesia. It is endemic to Oceania and is not found in other Austronesian groups. Kava has great cultural and religious significance among Polynesians. The roots are pounded and mixed with water then strained through fibers. The resulting cloudy gray liquid is bitter with mildly psychoactive and narcotic properties, with a common effect being numbness around the lips and mouth. However, it is not hallucinogenic nor addictive. The potency of the root depends on the age of the plants. The leaves and roots can also be chewed directly resulting in a numbing effect and relaxation. It is traditionally consumed both in everyday social interactions and in religious rituals. Kava reached Hawaii, but it is absent in Aotearoa where it can not grow. Consumption of kava is also believed to be the reason why betel chewing, ubiquitous elsewhere, was lost for Austronesians in Oceania. According to Lynch (2002), the reconstructed Proto- Polynesian term for the plant, *kava, was derived from the Proto-Oceanic term *kawaRi in the sense of a \\"bitter root\\" or \\"potent root [used as fish poison]\\". It originally referred to Zingiber zerumbet, which was used to make a similar mildly psychoactive bitter drink in Austronesian rituals. Cognates for *kava include Pohnpeian sa-kau; Tongan, Niue, Rapa Nui, Tuamotuan, and Rarotongan kava; Samoan and Marquesan ava; and Hawaiian awa. In some languages, most notably MƒÅori kawa, the cognates have come to mean \\"bitter\\", \\"sour\\", or \\"acrid\\" to the taste. In the Cook Islands, the reduplicated forms of kawakawa or kavakava are also applied to the unrelated members of the genus Pittosporum. And in other languages like in Futunan, compound terms like kavakava atua refer to other species belonging to the genus Piper. The reduplication of the base form is indicative of falsehood or likeness, in the sense of \\"false kava\\". Piper retrofractum (Javanese long pepper) The Javanese long pepper (Piper retrofractum) is native to Island Southeast Asia from the Philippines to Sumatra. Its northern range also extends to southern China, mainland Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. However it was historically only cultivated in any great extent in the islands of Java and Bali, and surrounding islands, for the spice trade. Elsewhere it is mostly grown informally in the backyards of houses. It is very similar to the Indian long pepper (Piper longum) and is used in the same way in Southeast Asian cuisine. =Saccharum (sugarcane)= Map showing centers of origin of Saccharum officinarum in New Guinea, S. sinensis in southern China and Taiwan, and S. barberi in India; dotted arrows represent Austronesian introductions There are two centers of domestication for sugarcane (Saccharum spp.): one for Saccharum officinarum by Papuans in New Guinea and another for Saccharum sinense by Austronesians in Taiwan and southern China. Papuans and Austronesians originally primarily used sugarcane as food for domesticated pigs. The spread of both S. officinarum and S. sinense is closely linked to the migrations of the Austronesian peoples. Sugarcane field in Pampanga, Philippines Saccharum officinarum was first domesticated in New Guinea and the islands east of the Wallace Line by Papuans, where it is the modern center of diversity. Beginning at around 6,000 BP they were selectively bred from the native Saccharum robustum. From New Guinea it spread westwards to Island Southeast Asia after contact with Austronesians, where it hybridized with Saccharum spontaneum. The second domestication center is mainland southern China and Taiwan where S. sinense (though other authors identify it as S. spontaneum) was one of the original major crops of the Austronesian peoples from at least 5,500 BP. Introduction of the sweeter S. officinarum may have gradually replaced it throughout its cultivated range in Island Southeast Asia. From Island Southeast Asia, S. officinarum was spread eastward into Polynesia and Micronesia by Austronesian voyagers as a canoe plant by around 3,500 BP. It was also spread westward and northward by around 3,000 BP to China and India by Austronesian traders, where it further hybridized with Saccharum sinense and Saccharum barberi. From there it spread further into western Eurasia and the Mediterranean. The reconstructed word for \\"sugarcane\\" in Proto-Austronesian is **CebuS or *t…ôbuS, which became Proto-Malayo- Polynesian *tebuh, Proto-Oceanic *topu, and Proto-Polynesian *to. Modern cognates include Hoanya and Bunun sibus; Rukai cobos…ô or tib√≥so; Tagalog tub√≥; Chamorro tupu; Murik Kayan tebu; Malay tebu; Ansus tobu; Malmariv tov; Fijian dovu; Mele-Fila and Takuu toro; Samoan tolo; Tagula ro; Pohnpeian cheu; Tahitian to; Pukapukan, Rarotongan, and Tongan t≈ç; Hawaiian k≈ç; and Rapa Nui to or ta. In Malagasy, however, the word for \\"sugarcane\\" is fary, which is instead derived from Proto-Austronesian *pajey, meaning \\"rice\\". =Syzygium= Trees in the genus Syzygium contain some of the most important fruit trees among Austronesian peoples. Species cultivated or harvested for their edible fruit include the Java plum (Syzygium cumini), jambos (Syzygium jambos), lubeg (Syzygium lineatum), swamp maire (Syzygium maire), mountain apple (Syzygium malaccense), lipote (Syzygium polycephaloides), and the Java apple (Syzygium samarangense), among others. Two species are also important sources of spice: the clove tree (Syzygium aromaticum) and Indonesian bay leaf (Syzygium polyanthum). Syzygium malaccense (mountain apple) Mountain apples in Maui The mountain apple (Syzygium malaccense) along with the closely related species like the water apple (Syzygium aqueum) and the Java apple (Syzygium samarangense), are native throughout Island Southeast Asia and were cultivated since prehistory. They were all carried by Austronesians into the Pacific and planted deliberately. Mountain apple in bloom in Tonga They were valued primarily for their abundant edible fruits. It is also used for timber (usually for building houses) and parts of the trees are used in traditional medicine. The attractive flowers are also worn as personal hair adornments and in making leis. They were primarily propagated through cuttings by Melanesians and Polynesians. The groves of mountain apples found in the Pacific are often remnants of ancient plantings, as the seeds of the fruits are too large to be dispersed by the native birds. Related species endemic to the Pacific Islands were also utilized similarly, like Syzygium corynocarpum and Syzygium neurocalyx. There numerous names for mountain apples in Austronesian languages. In the Philippines, the terms can be reconstructed to Proto- Philippine *mak√∫pa, with cognates including Ilocano, Aklanon, and Cebuano mak√∫pa; and Tagalog and Bikol mak√≥pa. In Oceania, there are several cognate sets reconstructible for mountain apples and related species. Four of which are *pokaq, *marisapa, *sakau and *cay, with limited reflexes and may have originally referred to other species. The most widespread cognate set, however, can be reconstructed to Proto-Oceanic *kapika. Its cognates include Mussau kaviu; Seimat ahi, Lou keik; Maenge and Nakanai gaiva; Tami kapig; Yabem √†ing; Motu gavika; Bola kavika; Babatana kapika; Gela gaviga; Kwara'ae afio; Paamese ahie; Wayan, Niue, East Uvean, and Bauan kavika; Tongan fekika; Anutan kapika; Marquesan kehika; Mangarevan keika; Tahitian ahia; Hawaiian oohiaai; Rarotongan kaika; and MƒÅori kahika. In MƒÅori, the names have shifted to Metrosideros fulgens, which have similar-looking flowers, as Malay apples did not survive into Aotearoa. =Tacca leontopetaloides (Polynesian arrowroot)= Polynesian arrowroot (Tacca leontopetaloides) is another ancient Austronesian root crop closely related to yams. It is originally native to Island Southeast Asia. It was introduced throughout the entire range of the Austronesian expansion, including Micronesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. Polynesian arrowroot have been identified as among the cultivated crops in Lapita sites in Palau, dating back to 3,000 to 2,000 BP. It was also introduced to Sri Lanka, southern India, and possibly also Australia through trade and contact. Polynesian arrowroot in Maui Polynesian arrowroot, was a minor staple among Austronesians. The roots are bitter if not prepared properly, thus it was only cultivated as a secondary crop to staples like Dioscorea alata and Colocasia esculenta. Its importance increased for settlers in the Pacific Islands, where food plants were scarcer, and it was introduced to virtually all the inhabited islands. They were valued for their ability to grow in low islands and atolls, and were often the staple crops in islands with these conditions. In larger islands, they were usually allowed to grow feral and were useful only as famine food. Several cultivars have been developed in Polynesia due to the thousands of years of artificial selection. The starch extracted from the root with traditional methods can last for a very long time, and thus can be stored or traded. The starch can be cooked in leaves to make starchy puddings. Due to the introduction of modern crops, it is rarely cultivated today. The names for Polynesian arrowroot in Austronesian languages reflect its secondary importance as a crop. They are often reassignments from names of other starch crops, rather than specifically being for Polynesian arrowroot. Usually, the names of Polynesian arrowroot are transferred from the names of the sago palms (Metroxylon sagu), giant swamp taros (Cyrtosperma merkusii), and fermented breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis). Derivations from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *sagu (\\"sago palm\\"), include Chamorro and Toba Batak sagu. Derivations from Proto-Polynesian *mƒÅ (\\"fermented breadfruit\\"), included Tongan mƒÅhoaa; Tokelauan mahoƒÅ; Anutan maoa; East Futunan mƒÅsoƒÅ; Samoan mƒÅsoƒÅ; and Tuvaluan mƒÅsoa. Derivations from Proto- Polynesian *bulaka (giant swamp taro) include Patpatar and Tolai pulaka. Derivations from Proto-Austronesian *biRaq (giant taro) include √Ñiwoo (to)piya. And finally, derivations from Proto-Oceanic Rabia (sago) include Bauan yabia; and Pileni, Rarotongan, and Hawaiian pia. =Talipariti tiliaceum (sea hibiscus)= Sea hibiscus flowers in Puna'auia, Tahiti Sea hibiscus (Talipariti tiliaceum) is a common tree in beaches in the tropical Indo- Pacific. It is widely used by Austronesian peoples for timber and fiber. It has several subspecies, two of which are endemic to the Philippines and Sulawesi, with the rest widespread throughout its range or native to large regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The seeds remain viable for months after floating in the sea. However, no remains of beach hibiscus have been recovered from Polynesia prior to the Austronesian arrival, making it clear that they were introduced by Austronesian voyagers. The wood is soft and not very durable, so it is mostly only used for products like carvings, spears, bowls, and bracelets. However, it is also resistant to saltwater and thus can be used to make small canoes and outriggers. The wood is also preferred for fire making by friction. The fiber extracted from the bark is widely used to make cordage and for caulking. The bark is also used in the production of tempeh in Southeast Asia, and kava drinks in Polynesia. The attractive flowers are commonly made into leis in Hawaii. The terms for beach hibiscus can be reconstructed to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *baRu, which became Proto-Oceanic *paRu and Proto-Micronesian *kili-fau. Modern cognates include Itbayaten vayu; Ilocano bag√≥; Kankana-ey b√°go; Chamorro pagu; Tagalog balibago; Cebuano malabago or maribago; Maranao bago; Ngaju Dayak baro; Malagasy baro or varo; Malay baru; Javanese, Rembong, and Kambera waru; Sangir and Soboyo bahu; Makasar baru; Erai hau; Leti paru; Paulohi haru; Buruese fahu; Gitua paru; Mailu waru; Mota var or varu; Sye nau or vau; Anejom n-hau; Fijian vau; Tongan and Samoan fau; Rotuman, Rennellese, and Hawaiian hau; and MƒÅori whau. In addition, there are numerous terms relating to the use of sea hibiscus for cordage and fiber in various Austronesian languages which can be traced back to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian or Proto-Austronesian, like *Calis, \\"rope\\". =Thespesia populnea (Pacific rosewood)= Pacific rosewood in Hawaii The Pacific rosewood (Thespesia populnea) is closely related to beach hibiscus. They are similar in appearance and grow in the same habitats, thus they are commonly confused with each other. It is also used similarly among Austronesian cultures, being one of the main sources of bast fibers for the production of cordage and wood for Austronesian outrigger ships and carving. Pacific rosewood is native to the Old World tropics. Like beach hibiscus, the seeds remain viable for months after floating in the sea but no remains of T. populnea have been recovered from Polynesia prior to the Austronesian expansion. Thus it is regarded as deliberate introductions by Austronesian settlers. The trees were regarded as sacred in Polynesian culture, and were commonly planted in marae sites along with trees like Ficus, Fagraea berteroana, Casuarina equisetifolia and Calophyllum inophyllum. The terms for Pacific rosewood can be reconstructed to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *balu, with cognates including Itbayaten valu; Malagasy v√°lo; Simeulue falu; Ngela valu; Arosi haru; and Lonwolwol bal. Another term which extends to Oceanic is Proto- Malayo-Polynesian *banaRu with cognates including Hanun√≥'o banagu; Tolai banar; Patpatar banaro; Mota vanau; and Pohnpeian pana. In Eastern Polynesia, most modern names can be reconstructed back to Proto-Eastern Oceanic *milo, with cognates including Tongan, Niue, Samoan, and Hawaiian milo; Rapa Nui, Tahitan, Tuamotuan, and MƒÅori miro; and Marquesan mio. In some islands, the names have shifted to refer to trees that are used similarly, like Prumnopitys ferruginea in Aotearoa and Sophora toromiro in Rapa Nui. =Zingiberaceae (gingers)= Gingers (family Zingiberaceae) were cultivated extensively by Austronesians for food, medicine, weaving materials, and for religious purposes. The most commonly cultivated species include the lengkuas (Alpinia galanga), fingerroot (Boesenbergia rotunda), turmeric (Curcuma longa), torch ginger (Etlingera elatior), and ginger (Zingiber officinale). Other species were also exploited at a smaller scale or harvested from the wild, including dwarf cardamom (Alpinia nutans), panasa cardamom (Amomum acre), white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria), jiddo (Hornstedtia scottiana), white ginger lily (Hedychium coronarium), and bitter ginger (Zingiber zerumbet). Alpinia galanga (lengkuas) Lengkuas rhizomes from Malaysia The lengkuas (Alpinia galanga) is native to Southeast Asia. Its original center of cultivation during the spice trade was Java, and today it is still cultivated extensively in Island Southeast Asia, most notably in the Greater Sunda Islands and the Philippines. It is valued for its use in food and for traditional medicine and is regarded as being superior to ginger. It has a pungent smell reminiscent of black pepper. The red and white cultivars are often used differently, with the red cultivars being primarily medicinal, and the white cultivars being primarily a spice. Lengkuas is also the source of the leaves used to make nanel among the Kavalan people of Taiwan, a rolled leaf instrument used as a traditional children's toy common among Austronesian cultures. Lengkuas can be reconstructed to Proto-Western Malayo-Polynesian *la≈ãkuas, with cognates including Ilokano langku√°s; Tagalog, Bikol, Kapampangan,Visayan, and Manobo langk√°uas or langk√°was; Aklanon eangkaw√°s; Kadazan Dusun hongkuas; Ida'an lengkuas; Ngaju Dayak langkuas; Iban engkuas; and Malay lengkuas (from which the English name is derived from). Some of the names have become generalized and are also applied to other species of Alpinia as well as for Curcuma zedoaria. Curcuma longa (turmeric) Turmeric (\`≈çlena) in Hawaii There is strong evidence that turmeric (Curcuma longa) as well as the related white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria) were independently domesticated by Austronesians. Turmeric has a very widespread distribution and names that pre-date contact with India, being found among all Austronesian regions with the exception of Taiwan. However, it was seemingly originally domesticated for the production of dyes, eventually contributing to the words for \\"yellow\\" and \\"red\\" in various Austronesian languages. White turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria) The plant is important in the Philippines and Indonesia as a traditional dye for clothing and food coloring. It was particularly valued for coloring food offerings to spirits as well as body painting in religious rituals or social ceremonies. It is also used as a spice, as medicine and as food. Similar uses are also found in the other islands settled by Austronesians, including Madagascar and the Comoros in East Africa. In Micronesia, it was a valuable trade item acquired from Yap. In Polynesia and Melanesia, they are primarily used as body paint in rituals or as a cosmetic. The latter regions have been isolated for centuries from the rest of Island Southeast Asia prior to European contact. Turmeric (kunyit) in Singapore There are two main cognate sets for C. longa and C. zedoaria (both of which produce yellow dye) in Austronesian languages. The first is reconstructed as Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *kunij which originally referred to turmeric. Its cognates include Ilocano, Kankana-ey, and Isneg k√∫nig; Bontoc k√∫n…ôg; Ifugao ≈´nig; Casiguran Dumagat kuneg; Iban and Malay kunyit; Toba Batak hunik; Javanese kunir; Sangir and Tae' kuni ª; Uma kuni; Rembong kunis; Ngadha wun√©; and Manggarai wunis. In Malagasy and Betsimisaraka, the cognates h√≥nitra and h√∫nitra have shifted meaning to a different plant used to make red dye. Other cognates like Ilocano kimm√∫nig; Uma mo-kuni, and Tae' pakuniran all mean \\"yellow\\" or \\"to dye something yellow\\". The other cognate set is derived from reconstructed Proto-Western- Malayo-Polynesian *temu, and originally meant C. zedoaria which was used primarily as a spice. It also sometimes shifted to ginger and other ginger- like plants used for cooking (rather than dye production). Its cognates include Kapampangan and Balinese tamu; Tagalog t√°mo; Visayan tamangyan; Bukidnon tamohilang; Bikol tamahilan or tamaylan; Malay, Javanese, and Sasak temu; Makasarese tammu; and Malagasy tamutamu. In other Austronesian languages in East Africa, however, the other cognates mean \\"yellow\\", including Comorian Shibushi and Antemoro tamutamu; and Antambahoaka and Antankarana manamutamu. In Proto-Oceanic, there are two main cognate sets derived from reconstructed *a≈ão and *de≈ã(w)a, both are unrelated to the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian etymons. The latter probably originally applied to the dye produced from turmeric, while the former referred originally to the plant itself. Cognates include Fijian cango; and Tongan and Rennellese ango. Cognates that mean \\"yellow\\" also exist in numerous other languages in Near Oceania. Ginger plants in Mindanao Zingiber officinale (ginger) Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is native to Island Southeast Asia and was probably originally domesticated by Austronesians. It is an ancient and ubiquitous crop among Austronesians, reaching all the way to Remote Oceania and Madagascar. Aside from being used for cuisine, ginger appears to have significant religious and medicinal roles in early Austronesian cultures, based on the glosses it acquired. Ginger were chewed by shamans and spat out intermittently in rituals for healing, warding, and blessing ships. In Proto-Austronesian, the terms for ginger can be reconstructed to *dukduk. With cognates including Pazeh dukuduk; Thao suksuk; Tsou cucu; and Saaroa suusuku. This was replaced by *laqia in languages south of Taiwan. The terms for ginger beyond Taiwan can be reconstructed to Proto- Malayo-Polynesian *laqia, which became Proto-Oceanic *laqia and Proto-Central Polynesian *laya. Cognates include Ilocano, Agta, Isneg, Itawis, Kankana-ey, and Casiguran Dumagat lay√°; Bontoc, Ifugao and Kapampangan l√°ya; Batad Ifugao lƒÅya; Tagalog luya; Bikol l√°ya; Visayan luya; Tboli leiye; Kadazan Dusun hazo; Tombonuwo and Abai Sembuak layo; Ida'an Begak lejo; Basap, Long Anap Kenyah, Sangir, and Tontemboan lia; Lun Dayeh and Kelabit lieh; Berawan and Miri º lejeh; Narum lejieh; Kenyah (√íma L√≥ngh) lez√≥; Murik and Iban lia; Kelai and Wahau Kenyah je; Segai aljo; Modang lejaoÃØ; Kiput lecih; Bintulu leza; Iban lia; Dayak roii; Jarai reya; Malay halia; Tialo lo√≠a; Balaesang l√°ia; Bare'e leia; Tae laia or laya; Makasarese laia; Muna longhia; Bimanese rea; Manggarai, Roti, Erai, Leti, Wetan. and Lamaholot lia; and Sika and Ngadha lea; Kowiai and Kei leii. In Oceanic languages, cognates include Lou and Kairiru lei; Penchal lai; Ahus and Kurti liy; Drehet lip; Lindrow ley; Mussau and Wuvulu, Neham laia; Tanga lae; Lakalai la lahia; Gitua laea; Wedau naia; 'ƒÄre'ƒÅre and Arosi ria; Sa'a lie; and Fijian cango laya. Zingiber zerumbet (bitter ginger) Bitter ginger in Maui Bitter ginger (Zingiber zerumbet) is native to tropical Asia and Australasia. Like the ginger, was carried by Austronesian settlers all the way to Remote Oceania during prehistoric times. Thus it is likely that it was originally domesticated by Austronesians. Remains of bitter ginger have also been identified from the Kuk Swamp archaeological site in New Guinea at the Phase 1 layers dated to 10,220 to 9,910 BP. However, whether they were cultivated or simply exploited from the wild is unknown. Bitter ginger is primarily used for traditional medicine. It also has mildly psychoactive properties when consumed, and thus had ritual importance among early Austronesian cultures. According to Lynch (2002), terms for bitter ginger in the sense of \\"bitter root\\" or \\"potent root [used as fish poison]\\", reconstructed as Proto-Oceanic *kawaRi, is believed to have been transferred to the kava (Piper methysticum), which has similar properties and is also bitter-tasting, when Austronesians of the Lapita culture first encountered it among the indigenous non-Austronesian peoples in Melanesia. Some reflexes of it still refer to bitter ginger, including Sissano (una)kaw; Gapapaiwa kaware; Tikopia, Anutan, and Wallisian kava-pui; Samoan ava-pui; Tahitian ava-puhi; and Hawaiian awa-puhi. Other reflexes also refer to other members of the genus Piper, to fish poison, or as words to describe bitter, sour, or acrid flavors. In non-Oceanic languages, terms for bitter ginger can be reconstructed to Proto-Western Malayo-Polynesian *lampuya≈ã, with cognates including Cebuano and Ngaju Dayak lampuyang; Javanese lempuyang; and Malay lempoyang. Animals Domesticated, semi-domesticated, and commensal animals carried by Austronesian voyagers include the following: =Bubalus bubalis (water buffalo)= The carabao, a swamp-type water buffalo from the Philippines Water buffaloes are essential work animals in Austronesian paddy field agriculture and were carried along with rice to Island Southeast Asia from mainland Asia. Early introductions were specifically of the swamp-type water buffaloes (like the carabao), although they are increasingly being replaced by river-type water buffaloes imported from South Asia in recent times. The earliest remains of water buffaloes in Island Southeast Asia with signs of domestication comes from multiple fragmentary skeletal remains recovered from the upper layers of the Neolithic Nagsabaran site, part of the Lal-lo and Gattaran Shell Middens (~2200 BCE to 400 CE) of northern Luzon. Most of the remains consisted of skull fragments, almost all of which have cut marks indicating they were butchered. The remains are associated with red slipped pottery, spindle whorls, stone adzes, and jade bracelets; which have strong affinities to similar artifacts from Neolithic Austronesian archeological sites in Taiwan. Based on the radiocarbon date of the layer in which the oldest fragments were found, water buffaloes were first introduced to the Philippines by at least 500 BCE. =Canis lupus familiaris (dog)= Map depicting possible phylogeographic origins of dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and Island Southeast Asian and Oceanian dogs, based on recent genetic evidence (Fillios & Ta√ßon, 2016) Dogs were primarily valued for their social functions in various Austronesian cultures, acting as companions and pets. They were also trained to be hunting or guard dogs. Ornaments made from dog fur, teeth, and bones are found in archaeological sites throughout Austronesia. These could be traded as commodities, along with dog pups. Dogs were also sometimes eaten, but this varies by culture, with most groups refusing to eat dogs, while in others they were apparently a main food source. A taumi, a traditional breast ornament fringed with dog hair from the Tuamotus, James Cook Collection: Australian Museum The origins of the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) population in Island Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Guinea are contentious, with various authors proposing origins from either Mainland Southeast Asia, Taiwan, or both at different times. These introduction events have been linked to the origin of the Australian dingoes and the New Guinea singing dogs, both of which are clearly descended from domesticated dogs. The specifics of which population they are derived from, who introduced them, and whether they come from a common ancestor, however, still do not have a consensus. Regardless, most authors agree that there were at least two introduction events. One arriving with Paleolithic maritime hunter-gatherers by at least 10,000 to 5,000 BP, and another arriving with later Neolithic migrations of farming and trading cultures (including those of Austronesians) by at least 5,000 BP. The Neolithic dogs are differentiated from previous populations in having the ability to digest starch, indicating that they accompanied humans that cultivated cereal crops. Lei niho  ªƒ´lio from Hawaii using dog teeth Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphic depiction of an  ªƒ´lio (Hawaiian Poi Dog) The Neolithic introductions are believed to have partially replaced the original introductions and became the ancestors of the modern village dogs of Southeast Asia. Unlike the first wave, they have adaptations that enable them to digest starch, indicating that they accompanied cultivators of cereal crops. The oldest archaeological remains of dogs in Island Southeast Asia and Oceania is a dog burial in Timor and dingo remains in Australia, both of which are dated to around 3,500 BP. The former are believed to have been part of the second wave and the latter from the first wave. From Island Southeast Asia, they were carried by Austronesian voyagers into Near Oceania. Dogs, however, were rare in Lapita culture archaeological sites. Some authors have suggested that Austronesian dogs were \\"lost\\" during the early colonization of Near Oceania, purportedly because they were less useful in small island environments. This is said to be the reason for the discontinuity for the terms for \\"dog\\" in languages in Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Island Melanesia, and the Pacific Islands. The dog remains in Lapita therefore may have been from individual dogs and dog ornaments acquired from traders from Southeast Asia or more likely from neighboring non-Lapita cultures in New Guinea, where dogs were widely present. But this remains a hypothesis. Nevertheless, dogs were subsequently carried eastward into Polynesia by post-Lapita Austronesian migrations, reaching as far as Hawaii and Aotearoa. Genetic studies have shown that Polynesian dogs are apparently descended from the first wave of dog introductions and are not related to the dogs originating from Taiwan and the Philippines, though this may be an artifact of a founder effect. On certain Pacific islands, settlers did not bring dogs, or the dogs died out after original settlement, notably: the Mariana Islands, Palau, Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas, Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island, Chatham Islands, and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs in order to escape discovery by passing ships). Dogs were not introduced to Madagascar by Austronesians. A genetic study by Ardalan et al. (2015) revealed that the dog population in Madagascar were all derived solely from African dog populations and did not come from Southeast Asian dog populations. This aberrant origin is also reflected in the Malagasy languages, where the terms for \\"dog\\" originate entirely from African Bantu languages. Given the inferred importance of dogs to Austronesian voyagers, the authors proposed that the Austronesian settlers in Madagascar may have initially brought dogs, but they either died or were used as food sources during the journey. Another possibility is that the limited initial number of Austronesian dogs may have simply resulted in their genes getting swamped by the influx of a far larger population of dogs from Africa. =Gallus gallus (chicken)= Junglefowl were one of the three main animals (along with domesticated pigs and dogs) carried by early Austronesian peoples from Island Southeast Asia in their voyages to the islands of Oceania. =Sus scrofa domesticus (pig)= Pigs were one of the three main animals (along with domesticated chickens and dogs) carried by early Austronesian peoples from Island Southeast Asia in their voyages to the islands of Oceania. =Rodentia (rodents)= The following rodent species are common in mainland Southeast Asia, but are restricted to areas of wet rice cultivation in western Indonesia (Sumatra and Java).Groves, Colin P. 2006. Domesticated and Commensal Mammals of Austronesia and Their Histories.

The event overall had 3,036 participants making it the largest FIBA-sanctioned tournament ever. This record is to be confirmed by FIBA. Background The organizing of the Manok ng Bayan-SBP 3X3 was an attempt to break world records in participation in FIBA-sanctioned 3x3 basketball tournaments. The previous record for the most participated FIBA-sanctioned youth tournament is at 1,114 participants while the most participated tournament record overall was set at 1,898 players.

As of January 11, 2019, the Philippines is ranked 55th in the Federation Rankings with 545,311 points. Collegiate players Kobe Paras and Thirdy Ravena also joined the event as guests. The fundamentals of 3x3 basketball, which has several differences to the standard five-a-side basketball, was also taught to students since the event also served as an outreach program. The event was an initiative of the Cebu Provincial Sports Commission and commercial basketball coach Van Halen Parmis. Chooks-to-Go and the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas selected the Sisters of Mary Schools as the venue of the event. The event also served as the official kickoff to the upcoming Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3 league. Participants had to get themselves registered with the FIBA 3x3 play database. One hundred coaches were also tapped in order to prepare the participants of the event.

Throughout her career Lamassonne has explored a plethora of disciplines such as film, printmaking, painting, graphic design, video art, and music. Lamassonne‚Äôs work is notable for reflecting this combination of several different studies, most noticeably that of her paintings having a very cinematic vision behind them. Noteworthy works of Lamassonne‚Äôs all contain this sense of multifaceted technical skills put into them. A majority of Lamassonne's work contains motifs of sensuality from a woman's perspective, specifically she includes sexuality from her own perspectives and experiences. Moreover, her signature combination of feminine-led sexuality and a frank expression of true life have led to both Lamassonne and her work being the subject of criticism via censorship.  Early life and education  Lamassonne was born in 1954 in New York to an Argentine father and Colombian mother. Her childhood was split between New York and Bogota, with Lamassonne residing in Colombia for the majority of the beginning of her artistic career. Lamassonne studied the arts throughout grade school. Towards the end of the 1960s, while attaining her bachelor's degree in California, Lamassonne began to study under the artist Charles Garoian. Specifically, she attended Foothill College (1969‚Äì1971) at Los Altos, California at which she focused her studies on printmaking and painting. Later on, in 1973, Lamassonne decided to further her study of paintings by studying under the artist David Manzur in Bogot√°.  Notable works  = Ba√±os (1979‚Äì1980) = A series of watercolors which began in 1979, when Lamassonne left Europe to return to Bogota. Ba√±os is a notable series as it established Lamassonne's reputation as an artist who did not follow the typical rules assigned to her gender, since she chooses to explicitly depict her sexuality and moments of intimacy as a feminine being. Furthermore, this series gained notoriety due to the censorship it received when it was displayed at an executive's gallery; during a meeting at the Galer√≠a del Club de Ejecutivos, one of the executives stopped a lecture and stated that \\"it was impossible to continue ‚Äòif those obscenities‚Äô (the paintings) were not taken down\\". =Pura Sangre (1982) = This film project served as Lamassonne's film and video debut, specifically working as a production designer alongside Mario Cano. Pura Sangre is a notable piece of work for Lamassonne as it not only heavily injected with her visual identity, but it also served as one of the pioneering works for the \\"Caliwood\\" film movement as led by Luis Opsina, the director of Pura Sangre. = Secretos Intimos (1982) = One of Lamassonne's first personal film projects that she both produced and directed. This short features music from artists that Lamassonne listened to throughout her youth, such as Marvin Gaye and The Rolling Stones. \\"Secretos Intimos\\" shows a series of clips that all relate back to Lamassonne's signature explicit expression of her sexuality, in this case it is showcased in its relation to Cali, Colombia. = Ruidos (1984) = Another one of Lamassonne's more well-known personal film endeavors, which also delves into Lamassonne's signature sexuality. This short also focuses on Lamassonne's sexuality in her youth, however it exchanges its Colombia setting for a more New York ambience; the city elements come through via her inclusion of very domestic images.

Life He was born in Kharkiv, and became a student of Vladimir Serbsky. Before World War I he developed an interest in the theories of Alfred Adler. Originally trained as a psychoanalyst, Zalkind was involved in an attempt to promote \\"Freudism\\" as an interpretation of psychoanalysis compatible with Marxism- Leninism. When this proved politically impossible, he became an advocate of paedology and when he took over as Director of the Psychological Institute of Moscow it was renamed the Institute of Psychology, Paedology and Industrial Psychology. Works His most famous text was The Twelve Sexual Commandments of the Revolutionary Proletariat (1925). Here Zalkind argues for sexual abstinence. In 1928 with Ernst Kolman he edited Life and Technology of the Future: Social and Scientific-Technical Utopias, an anthology of various historic utopian texts supplemented by six texts written by the contemporary Soviet intellectuals. Whereas the first five of these depict non-political technocratic utopias, the sixth, by Zalkind, entitled \\"The Psychology of the Future Man (Socio-Psychological Study)\\" was more critical: Zalkind criticised previous utopian writers for their inability to realise their utopias, something which could at that time be overcome, he claimed, thanks to the scientific nature of Marxism-Leninism. He then described a future where social environment would be transformed by a ‚Äúmature Communist‚Äù ideology: human body function would alter, women would give birth to children less frequently and would experience easier pregnancies; sexuality would be less ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù both physically and emotionally. Personal physical instincts would become social instincts; people succumb less frequently to physical and mental exhaustion. However the bodies of future humanity would be smaller and finer, while their life expectancy would be almost infinite. In 1930 Zalkind wrote a hostile preface to Sigmund Freud's The Future of an Illusion, which was the last of Freud's works to be translated into Russian in the Soviet Era.

Family Guy follows an American nuclear family led by oafish Peter Griffin in the fictional New England town of Quahog. Continuing from \\"Hefty Shades of Gray,\\" Griffin is invited by Donald Trump to become the White House Press Secretary. Although the producers of Family Guy have mocked Trump as well as many prominent Republican figures in the past, this was the first episode focused on Trump. Plot Peter Griffin and his family move to Washington D.C. after he was hired to work for Donald Trump, at the end of the previous episode, \\"Hefty Shades of Gray\\". Meg Griffin is less than pleased about the move, but after meeting Ivanka Trump and getting a makeover, she suddenly becomes more attractive, at least by \\"Washington D.C. standards\\". But when Ivanka leaves her with Donald, he grabs Meg inappropriately by her privates, leaving her shocked and her family refusing to believe her when she tells them. But when he tries to molest her a second time, the rest of the Griffins catch him in the act. This leads Peter to resign his job and to try to be a kinder man. But when he is unsurprisingly unable to keep this vow, Trump rubs it in his face and insults him as a failed role model. Peter and Trump engage in a protracted fight, after the former questions his actual net worth. The fight leads to a point where their lives are threatened by falling off the Washington Monument before being saved by Justin Trudeau with an industrial air mattress. In the finale, the Griffins break the fourth wall to encourage Americans to read the Steele dossier.

The life cycle of Coolia involves an asexual stage where the cell divides by binary fission and a sexual stage where cysts are produced. Some of the species, for example, Coolia tropicalis and Coolia malayensis, produce toxins that can potentially cause shellfish poisoning in humans. Etymology The genus was named after a Pharmacist, M. Cool, from Nieupoort, Belgium, where the first species of the genus Coolia, Coolia monotis was originally discovered in the oyster beds. Taxonomy Coolia was first described by Alphonse Meunier (1919). At the time of discovery, it was placed in its own monospecific genus. At that time, the only species identified was Coolia monotis, which was discovered in oyster beds and the waters surrounding Nieupoort, Belgium. Between 1928 and 1956, Coolia monotis was placed in the same genus as Ostreopsis species, which is a genus also in the family Ostreopidaceae, because Coolia and Ostreopsis have similar patterns on their epithecae. In 1956 however, because of distinct differences in the hypotheca, it was put back into its individual genera in the family Ostreopidaceae. Coolia monotis remained the only species in the Coolia until 1995. In 1995, Coolia tropicalis was described. In 2000, Coolia areolata was described. In 2008, Coolia canariensis was described. In 2010, Coolia malayensis was described. Most recently in 2015, Coolia santacroce and Coolia palmyrensis were described. Species include: *Coolia areolata *Coolia canariensis *Coolia malayensis *Coolia monotis *Coolia tropicalis *Coolia santacroce *Coolia palmyrensis Description =Morphology= Coolia has small spherical cells and is anteroposteriorly compressed. The cell size varies based on the species, but they have been typically reported to be approximately between 23-50 Œºm in length and 21-45 Œºm wide. Coolia cells are distinguished by having a round hypotheca that is larger than their round epitheca. Coolia has plates covering the thecal surface that have an irregular pattern and are various sizes. In most species, the thecal surface contains intercalary bands and is smooth and covered with large thecal pores that are round and ovoid. Another distinguishing feature to identify Coolia is a plate on the epitheca that is off centred and contains an apical pore complex with a long, curved pore that has a slit containing two costae. This apical pore is often visible because of its large size. Coolia also has an ellipsoidal-shaped ventral pore on the ventral surface. From a dorsal view of the cell, the lipped cingulum (located equatorially) can be viewed. The cingulum is narrow and the inside surface has round pores with smooth edges. There are also marginal pores surrounding the lipped cingulum. Coolia also has a narrow sulcus that contains relatively short longitudinal flagellum at the posterior end. As Coolia is photosynthetic, it contains golden-brown discoid chloroplasts. The cells also only contain one nucleus with condensed chromosomes in the hypocone. =Life cycle= Coolia has an asexual and a sexual life cycle. It is thought that under low nutrients, low light, or low temperature conditions, sexual reproduction may be initiated, resulting in the production of a resting cyst. Cells divide asexually by binary fission. The division process begins as the single nucleus with condensed chromosomes elongates and two nuclei develop parallel to each other. Before dividing into daughter cells, the dividing cells stay attached to each other for approximately 12-24 hours. The doubling time of Coolia is approximately 3-4 days Sexual reproduction occurs as gametes begin to form in the population; this is an irreversible transition. Gametes move around each other rapidly and then align laterally, forming gamete pairs with the girdle and sulcus contacting each other, forming a fertilization bridge. A planozygote is formed when the cells stop moving and the fertilization bridge disappears, allowing the two nuclei to join together. This indicates that karyogamy has occurred. The theca then begins to develop and the cell becomes motile. As the planozygote matures, it shrinks and becomes immobile, eventually developing into a cyst. The cyst further develops to contain a single nucleus that makes up much of the volume of the cell. At the end of the process, meiosis occurs. The sexual life cycle is thought to last approximately 2 months. =Genetics= Phylogenetic analysis of different regions of rDNA supports the separate genus‚Äô for Ostreopsis and Coolia. Analysis of 5.8S rDNA-ITS sequence alignments from European and Asian isolates and their out-groups supports distinct lineages of Ostreopsis and Coolia. Lineages of Ostreopsis from Europe and Asia are genetically isolated and separate from lineages of Coolia from Europe and Asia. This indicates that the lineages of Ostreopsis and Coolia evolved independently. Additionally, analysis of LSU rDNA data shows that all the species of Coolia share a more recent common ancestor with each other than they do with Ostreopsis, who share a more recent common ancestor with other species in its genus. Habitat and ecology Coolia is found globally in coastal marine regions of both temperate and tropical waters. Coolia monotis have a large habitat range and is found in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate regions, whereas other species such as Coolia areolata and Coolia tropicalis have a more restricted range and are typically found in tropical regions. Coolia is typically a benthic type organism and can be attached to sandy substrates, coral, or brown and red seaweed. In addition, it also can act as a planktonic organism and form blooms in the water column. Coolia, especially in tropical regions, forms assemblages with Gambierdiscus toxicus; thus, they are often falsely described as being responsible for causing ciguatera. Cigutera is actually caused by Gambierdiscus toxicus, not Coolia. Human importance Coolia is considered a toxic dinoflagellate genus. Some of the species are known to be toxic and produce harmful algal blooms (HABs) that are of potential concern to human health. They produce yessotoxins. The species that are known to produce the toxins are Coolia tropicalis, Coolia malayensis, Coolia santacroce and Coolia palmyrensis. However, it is possible other species of the genus also produce toxins.

Early life and education  Webb was a native of Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. After three years of study at Guy's Hospital in London, he came to the United States in 1893.Gilbert, G. Burton, \\"Dr. Gerald B. Webb\\" Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc. 1948; 60: lvi‚Äìlvii He and his American- born wife settled in Denver, in the hope that the mountain air would prove beneficial to the tuberculosis with which she had been diagnosed. They remained in Denver for several years, with Webb receiving his M.D. degree from the University of Denver in 1896 and subsequently working in private practice.The American Association of Immunologists: Gerald B. Webb, M.D.  Tuberculosis research  Webb's wife finally succumbed to her tuberculosis, dying in 1903, and he himself suffered a near-fatal bout of sepsis leading him to return to Europe to further his medical education. He spent two years pursuing postgraduate work, first in Vienna and later in London. In the latter, he worked in the laboratory of the pioneering British immunologist Almroth Wright. When he returned to the United States in 1907, he opened a specialized practice limited to the research and treatment of tuberculosis. Webb spent more than forty years working against tuberculosis. At first, he believed that inoculation with virulent tuberculosis was the only path towards immunity, but a long series of inoculation experiments convinced him of the impracticality of this approach. He then moved towards other methods, researching the effects of altitude on the blood of tuberculosis sufferers and refining existing methods of pneumothorax treatment. During World War I, he volunteered for service with the U.S. Army Medical Corps; he helped to organize the military's tuberculosis screening program, and was appointed one of the tuberculosis consultants for the American Expeditionary Forces. During the war, he spent much of his time in France, performing clinical examinations as well as lectures and other educational programs. After the war's end, he designated several hospitals for the treatment of TB-infected soldiers returning to America.Byerly, Carol R., \\"Good Tuberculosis Men: The Army Medical Department's Struggle with Tuberculosis\\", pp. 116-119 In 1924, Webb founded the Colorado Foundation for Research in Tuberculosis, which was renamed in his honor following his death.  Marriages and family  Webb married twice, both times to Americans. His first wife, Jenny Raphael Kenny, died in 1903 after suffering several years of tuberculosis. He remarried in 1904 to Varina Hayes, a granddaughter of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his second wife Varina. He and his second wife had five children: Varina Margaret Webb, Frances Robine Webb, Eleanor Leila Constance Webb, Joel Addison Hayes Webb, and Gerald Bertram Webb, Jr. (who died before his father, in 1947). His second wife predeceased him as well, leaving him her interest in Brierfield Plantation.Everett Jr., Frank Edgar, \\"Brierfield: Plantation Home of Jefferson Davis\\", pg. 118 Webb died of a heart attack at his home in Colorado Springs on 27 January 1948.

Generally .22 caliber and bolt- action, they also come in semi-automatic versions. They are often miniature .22 caliber versions of standard issue service rifles. Older 19th century cadet rifles were simply smaller and lighter versions of standard issue service rifles designed to fire reduced power cartridges.  Examples  * The Martini Cadet is a centerfire single-shot rifle produced in the United Kingdom by BSA and W.W. Greener for the use of Australian military Cadets. Although considered a miniature version of the Martini‚ÄìHenry, it is internally different. Chambered for the .310 Cadet cartridge (aka: .310 Greener), it was used from 1891 to 1955. * The Schmidt-Rubin Model 1897 cadet rifle was intended as a replacement for the earlier Vetterli rifles. The Model 97 rifles were single-shot using the bolt mechanism of the Schmidt-Rubin Model 89/96 rifle. It was to use a reduced power 7.5√ó55mm Swiss cartridge for the smaller younger cadets. The rifles sights were graduated both for the light and the standard loads. There were approximately 7900 of the cadet rifles made. * The Springfield Model 1922 is a .22 caliber bolt-action rifle. It features a 24-inch (61 cm) barrel and a 5-round magazine. It was built as a cadet rifle, designed to mimic the M1903 Springfield rifle for training purposes. It was produced in several different versions until World War II, when shortages of materials made production of a training rifle impractical. * The No.8 cadet rifle is a bolt-action .22 caliber version of the Lee‚ÄìEnfield designed for British Army target shooting. They are simple single-shot, hand-fed cadet rifles and were originally designed to be used by military marksmen firing in civilian competitions, before being turned over to the cadet forces. Currently, the Number 8 is used by the British cadet services as a basic target rifle. Some examples are in civilian ownership worldwide, especially following the disposal by the New Zealand cadet forces of their Number 8 and Number 9 rifles at auction. * The TOZ-8 is a single-shot, .22 caliber cadet rifle conceived in 1932 by the designer-gunsmith D. M. Kochetov and serially produced at the Tula Arms Plant. The TOZ-8 is a simple device, trouble-free and reliable in operation. It was widely used as the primary cadet rifle for military, paramilitary and police organizations in the USSR for decades. It is also used today for hunting small game. * The Mauser KKW cadet rifle is a single-shot, .22 caliber rifle that was introduced in 1938. It is virtually identical to the Karabiner 98k. These cadet rifles were used by all German military, paramilitary and police organizations, especially the Hitler Youth. * The CZ 452 (aka: the Trainer, Special or Special Military Training Rifle) is a .22 caliber, magazine-fed bolt-action rifle, equipped with a 24.8\\" (630 mm) barrel that is provisioned with tangent sights. The barrel is polished whereas the receiver has a matte finish; both are blued. The barreled action sits in a beech stock in the European-style with checkered grip, schnabel fore-end, and arched (curved) comb sometimes referred to as a Bavarian or \\"hogback\\" stock, and is trimmed with European sling swivels and a hard plastic butt plate. The lower drop at the heel and arched comb of the stock are designed to aid shooting with iron sights. The rear tangent sight is graduated in 25 meter increments with calibrated markings from 25 to 200 meters, while the sight leaf is adjustable for windage. The hooded front sight blade is adjustable for elevation. * The TOZ-17 is a Soviet .22 Long Rifle, bolt-action cadet rifle with 5 round detachable magazine made by the TOZ firearms company. It has a similar appearance and functions much the same as the Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle. The design reflects Soviet tradition, as it is very simple to use yet strong and functional. The rifle is very well built, reliable and accurate. It features twin extractors on the bolt which makes case ejection very positive. The bolt is considered large compared with most rimfire designs, paired with a large firing pin and spring assembly. The TOZ-17 has a free-floating barrel for increased accuracy. * The Parker Hale L81A2, officially known as the L81A2 Cadet Target Rifle (CTR), is a 7.62x51mm, heavy-barrel, bolt action, hand-fed, single-shot rifle. It replaced the L81A1 and is used by the ATC, ACF, SCC and CCF in competitions such as The Schools Meeting, The Ashburton staged annually in July by the Council for Cadet Rifle Shooting (CCRS), and the Inter Service Cadet Rifle Meeting (ISCRM) held at Bisley Ranges. * The C12A1 cadet target rifle is a 7.62x51mm, heavy-barrel, bolt-action, hand-fed, single-shot rifle with a free-floating barrel. It is a competition rifle used by members of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets for advanced training and target shooting competition. * The WASR-22 or AK-22 Trainer is a .22 Long Rifle, semi- automatic cadet rifle loosely based upon the AK-47 and manufactured in Romania by Cugir Arms Factory. Unlike the AK-47, it uses a simple blowback method of operation. As such, it has no gas system and the internal components have been modified accordingly. While designed to be a cadet rifle for basic firearms and marksmanship training for the Romanian Army, it was never used as such. Instead, it was sold on the civilian market, primarily in the United States in collaboration with Century International Arms. Because of its cheap ammo and low recoil, it is marketed as a ‚Äústarter‚Äù or ‚Äútrainer AK‚Äù. It is usually shipped with two 10-round magazines and is currently sold with the price ranging from $200 to US$500. * The L98A1 Cadet GP Rifle was a 5.56√ó45mm NATO cadet rifle used by the Combined Cadet Force and Sea, Royal Marine, Army Cadet Force and Royal Air Force Air Cadets in the United Kingdom. It was introduced in 1987 to replace the .303 Lee‚ÄìEnfield No 4 rifles and .303 Bren guns used for weapons training. The L98A1 rifle began a phased decommission in early 2009 and is now no longer in use. UK cadet forces have now received the updated L98A2 rifles. The L98A1 was similar to the L85A1, but lacked the gas components. It was a manually operated, single-shot rifle, with a cocking handle extension piece mounted on the right side of the weapon, and was cocked with the right hand. It was also fitted with adjustable iron sights. The L98A2 has the same gas parts and cocking handle of the L85A2, but lacks the selective fire switch. This means the L98A2 can only be operated in the semi- automatic mode but is the same in all other ways. * The Smith & Wesson M&P15-22; is a .22 Long Rifle variant of the Smith & Wesson M&P15.; It is blowback-operated, rather than direct impingement-operated. It is made with a polymer upper and lower receiver, rather than the aluminum that is normally used in M16 and AR-15 style rifle. It also uses proprietary polymer 10- and 25-round magazines. It was designed to be a less expensive alternative for training with an AR-15, as the rifle itself is much less expensive than most AR-15s, and the ammunition is also much less expensive than the .223 Remington/5.56√ó45mm NATO. The rifle features a safety, magazine release, operating handle and bolt lock that operate just like an AR-15's. * The SIG 522LR is a .22 LR semi-automatic, blowback operated rifle. It is patterned after the SIG 55x series rifles that fire 5.56x45mm centerfire cartridges. The 522 fires .22 LR ammunition and serves as a training rifle for its larger counterparts due to mostly identical controls and features. It differs from its centerfire counterpart in a number of ways. The 522 series has no adjustable gas block as the 55x series does. Instead, a mock gas block is installed. SIG refers to this as a storage container. Instead of 30-round magazines, the 522 series accepts 10-round or 25-round magazines that are manufactured by Black Dog Machine and re-branded for distribution with the SIG 522.  Conversion kits  .22 caliber conversion kits are commonly used on standard M16 rifles and M4 carbines. As .22LR ammunition is cheaper and less powerful than the standard 5.56x45mm ammo, this allows for cheaper target practice on indoor pistol ranges.

It would be part of the Alberta Provincial Parks system and governed by Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation under Alberta Environment and Parks. Proposed provincial park Alberta's provincial government under Premier Rachel Notley is proposing the new park as one way among many of \\"diversifying Alberta's economy through tourism. The proposed area to be set aside near Rocky Mountain House is \\"about the size of Rhode Island\\" and is the largest of four proposals for \\"new or expanded\\" parks.According to a January 7, 2019 The Globe and Mail article, with the oil industry in the early stages of a recovery following x years of a deep downturn, the Alberta provincial deficit is \\"projected at $8.8-billion\\". \\"In November, Alberta's NDP proposed four provincial parks, including the Bighorn Wildland Provincial Park, plus four provincial recreation areas and a new public-land-use zone in the area on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, west of Nordegg.\\" The proposed region, situated between Banff National Park and Jasper National Park , would provide a vast and critical wildlife corridor for numerous wildlife species, including sensitive species, such as bull trout‚ÄîAlberta‚Äôs provincial fish, wolverine, and grizzly bears, that would extend from Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in the south to the Yukon in Northern Canada. According to Lorne Fitch, who studied the bull trout for 50 years as a biologist with the fisheries, the bull trout is a \\"sentinel species\\" \\"whose abundance and distribution serve as an indicator of how well we have managed the landscape\\". The headwaters of the North Saskatchewan River, the source of drinking water for the province's capital city, Edmonton, which is hundreds of kilometres to the east, is located in the proposed region. The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) has indicated this region along with several others, as one that could \\"help Canada meet conservation targets under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Consultations on the four proposed parks will end in February 2019. \\"In an open letter that Phillips posted on Facebook, she specifically expressed her disappointment at United Conservative Party MLA Jason Nixon's \\"inaccurate statements\\" and \\"misinformation.\\" \\"Two telephone town hall sessions will be scheduled so people in Drayton Valley and Red Deer can ask government officials questions about the proposal.\\"  Activities  The following activities may be available in the proposed park:Alberta Parks \\"Over five years, the province would spend $40 million on developing infrastructure for camping, hiking, paddling, snowmobile and off-highway vehicle use.\\" Background In 1974 former premier Peter Lougheed held the eastern slopes hearings, to begin a conversation with \\"ranchers, hunters and sportsmen\\" about protecting the Bighorn Backcountry. In the 1980s roadmaps were created then \\"quickly rescinded.\\" Since the 1990s, The Bighorn Heritage ATV Society, ATV riders, such as the Bighorn Heritage ATV Society and other recreational vehicles, have \\"fought restricted access to the area\\", which is \\"popular with quadders and snowmobilers\\". In 1993 Harvey Locke began an essay entitled \\"Yellowstone to Yukon\\". It became the framework for one of Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y), a joint Canada‚ÄìUnited States charitable organization that supports the creation of the wildlife corridor, one of \\"North Americas leading conservation partnerships\\". Since 2002 with the creation of Alberta's Forests Act's \\"patchwork of land-use agreements\\", the area has been \\"protected by an access management plan.\\" In 2016, the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative sponsored a survey that was contracted to NRG Research Group and the Praxis Group‚Ñ¢ to poll Albertans' attitudes towards a new Bighorn Headwaters park. The report found that \\"There is strong support for establishing a park in the Bighorn. Over eighty percent (83%) of Edmonton residents and 68% of those living in communities and rural areas near the Bighorn support establishment of a park.\\" By 2017, the Y2Y project included \\"300 partner groups\\" and had \\"expanded its protected land into a 3,500-kilometre-long corridor that stretches from southern Wyoming to northern Yukon\\". In January 2018, \\"Hops and Headwaters\\" in support of a campaign to protect the headwaters of the Bighorn Backcountry\\" was held in Edmonton. It was criticized for its alleged association with Y2Y and Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS), described by critics as a \\"foreign- funded\\" organizations meddling in the Alberta's affairs.Y2Y and CPAWS are non- profit organizations that \\"receive some of their funding from foundations located outside of Canada.\\" In May 2018, the NDP government announced that Alberta was going to \\"create the largest protected area of boreal forest in the world by setting aside four new provincial parks and expanding another along its northeastern borders\\". With the announcement of the potential creation of Bighorn Wildland Provincial Park, concerns were raised that the park would lead to \\"encouraging more tourism, development of more campsites, cabins, tourist spots, tourist accommodations...\\" In September 2018 concerns were raised that, \\"existing mineral leases would be phased out, commercial development would be banned in the park, cattle grazing allotments would not be granted and motorized recreation vehicles would be prohibited in critical wildlife zones. Camping and trail access would also be restricted.\\" According to the November 2018 Alberta Parks document, existing activities and agreements would be honoured and continue, such as such as petroleum and natural gas agreements, grazing allocations, hunting and trapping, and the use of motorized recreation vehicles (OHV) on designated trails. The \\"plan calls for areas with a variety of permitted activities, including off-highway vehicles and hunting\\".

Biography Born in Norwalk, Connecticut, Frassetto was the daughter of pioneering filmmakers Robert J. Flaherty and Frances Hubbard Flaherty. On her third birthday, Frassetto's parents brought their daughter to the Pacific island of Samoa where they began working on Moana, their 1926 documentary film. Frassetto attended school in Heidelberg, Germany, and Devonshire, England. While in Europe she apprenticed with German scenic designer Hein Hechroth and Swiss painter Kurt Seligmann. In 1940, Frassetto took flying lessons in the United States. From 1942‚Äì44, she was stationed in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where she was a ferry pilot and Women Airforce Service Pilot. After the war, Frassetto took a job as a researcher at Fortune and worked for the Betty Parsons Art Gallery in New York from 1948‚Äì1952. She married Roy Lockwood, a British film and radio director, in 1947. They divorced in 1951. Frassetto lived in the US Virgin Islands from 1951‚Äì56, where she organized archaeological research programs there and in Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, she met and married Roberto Frassetto, an Italian archaeologist. They worked together and lived in La Spieza, Italy, between 1960 and 1966. Frassetto then returned to Puerto Rico, where she lived until 1970, when she moved back to the Flaherty farm in Dummerston, Vermont, to look after her mother. She lived in Vermont for 38 years, where she continued to run the Flaherty film study center, started by her mother. After she returned to Vermont, Frassetto donated her home in Puerto Rico to the Conservation Society of Puerto Rico. Moana with Sound Frassetto received an NEA grant in 1975 on which she returned to the island of SAVAI'I in Western Samoa, where her parents had first filmed Moana in 1924. She traveled with long-time friend and fellow filmmaker Richard Leacock. There she recorded a new soundtrack for the film consisting of field recordings and traditional songs, which she edited and synched to the film once back at MIT, again with Leacock. As the two had not recorded dialogue, Frassetto later returned to Hawaii to record with Samoan people there. She toured with the new film‚ÄìMoana with Sound‚Äìfrom 1981 until her death. Archaeology In 2018, her rubbings of Ta√≠no petroglyphs like ones found in the town of Jayuya in the mid-1950s were selected by artist Jorge Gonz√°lez for inclusion in his installation titled Ayacavo Guarocoel, shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art. For a 1960 study, \\"A Preliminary Report on Petroglyphs in Puerto Rico,\\" Frassetto made sixty surface prints at 13 sites in Puerto Rico.

Her recent work is artisanal but combines multi genre practice of the developing world and new innovations. Biography Corona Benjamin was born in Ensenada, Mexico and now works in both Mexico and the United States. She attended The Art Center in Pasadena, California where she received her Bachelor of Fine Arts. In 2009, she received the Guggenheim Fellowship award for her project Two Million Homes for Mexico. Furthermore, she was a recipient for SNCA Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, along with being a nominee for the Prix Pictet in 2013. In her recent work Nobody Knows, Nobody Knew , she explores social economic history and political symbolism that tackles the structures built in rural communities. This work consists mostly of photographs, painting and videos that uncover these grain silos that damage rural Mexico. Most of her projects unveil the disuse of these silos and mass migration from rural Mexico to the United States. Livia Corona Benjamin has had success with her artwork, as she has been in many exhibits. Her work has been seen worldwide which include LACMA, Los Angeles, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, Mexico City, Spain, and many more international exhibits. These works can be found in a collections of the Museo de Art Carrillo Gil, the Portland Museum of Art, William Benton Museum of Art, along with many other private collections. Benjamin's work expands to monographs, books, and catalogues. Education * Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Art Center in Pasadena, California Artworks Pacha, Llaqta, Wasichay: Indigenous Space, Modern Architecture, New Art discusses indigenous artwork that contains to Indigenous American ideas about their built environment and natural world. The title of the artwork are in Quechua, which is the language spoken by many Indigenous Americans. Each of the three words in the title hold a true significant value. For instance, Pacha means ‚Äúdenotes universe, time, space, nature, or world‚Äù. Llaqta values ‚Äúplace, country, community, or town‚Äù. Lastly, Wasichay means ‚Äúbuilding or constructing a house‚Äù. All of these meaning are influenced within the artwork that explore means of Indigenous groups from Mexico and South America. These include: Aymara, Maya, Aztec, and Taino. Although this work consists of various artists, Livia Corona Benjamin inputs her notion of complex relations amongst construction, land, and space that are indigenous in the Americas. Nadie Sabe, Nadie Supo is Benjamin's first solo exhibit that is primarily composed of two parts of photograms and a video. These two parts are separate but ultimately combine with Benjamin's project of exploring the silos in her native Mexico, which are built by the government. For instance the photograms aspect relates to Benjamin's project entitled, Infinite Rewrite. This project features images composed of granulated particles that create an illusion. Individually, each images establishes an equilibrium, that is replaced by the next image. These photograms play a role of photography during a time of digital reception and automation. Manhattan Transfer is presented in photography and sculpture, is Benjamin's first solo show in New York. This piece draws the ideal of Manhattan being the center for artistic achievements. The artwork includes a series of sculptures and unique photographs that pairs American idioms of culture with the trade goods of colonization along with cultural commodities. Previous/Next uses her fond interests of silos by taking photographs of abandoned grain solos that are throughout Mexico. Using these images, she is able appropriate the characteristics of her interests in silos in order to investigate of making and viewing images. Ultimately, Benjamin's goal is to discover the architectural process of salvage, deconstruction, and reuse. The Week In Pictures consists of C-prints which are silhouetted shapes against a different colored background. Overlapping, these create echoing contours of white negative space. These images appear to be abstract, but each are sketches drawn from Benjamin by the process of abstraction. By this method, she is able to rebuild her own scheme and offer and new transformed picture. The Road Was Paved With Silver is a socio-political artwork that explores Mexico's artisanal tourist trade. It further elaborates on the country's history as well as the global market in economic instability and political violence. The piece all use a silver material that helps \\"read\\" the piece, as the country's conflicting histories with these materials. Furthermore, Benjamin considers Mexico's booming silver tradition. As a result, Benjamin works to distance toward the flow of industrial world trade, while reflecting upon the individual and their works as they become embodied into the pressure of mass production.

He described over 200 species of wasps during his lifetime, almost all of which have been revised as synonyms of other species.  Biography  Rudow was born in the town of Eckartsberga, in what is now Germany. His father was a merchant. Rudow began working as a teacher in 1865. He was granted his doctorate in 1869 by Leipzig University with a thesis on mallophaga, or chewing lice. By 1876 he was a senior teacher, later a professor, at a Gymnasium (a type of secondary school) in the German city of Perleberg. He retired from teaching in 1906, although he continued to publish. He died in Naumburg in 1920.  Taxonomic work  Ferdinand Rudow and entomologist Fritz Hoffmann, date unknown Initially interested in studying lice and mites, Rudow began to focus on wasps in 1871. Over the course of his research, he described 234 species and varieties within the Ichneumonidae family of parasitoid wasps, eventually amassing a collection of close to 14,000 insect specimens. Rudow donated the collection to the of Jena personally in 1919. Numerous specimens in the collection were improperly stored, poorly identified, or damaged, although due to poor documentation it is impossible to say how much was received in poor condition and how much damage was caused by later poor storage. His work was heavily criticised as unscientific by his contemporaries. Richard Ritter von Stein denounced the poor quality of his publications as early as 1884. Rudow was aware of the criticism, and may have begun to withdraw from the scientific community as a result. He refused to accept modern systems of nomenclature, and often wrote critically of them. In 1908, for example, he wrote that he was \\"disgusted by the activities of the so-called 'systematics',\\" whose changes he felt were confusing and unhelpful. He was known for describing the same species more than once, or calling different species by the same name in a single paper. He also described already-known species as new, likely by accident. His early publications, until approximately 1888, were comparatively detailed, but the descriptions in his later work were often so vague or inaccurate that comparisons of described species or identification by specimen was not possible. Basic information such as the location where specimens were found, their habitats, and their preferred hosts was generally either full of errors or not included at all. The species he described have been extensively revised by subsequent entomologists, including English entomologist John Frederick Perkins in the 1930s and J. Oehlke in the 1960s, and most of them are now considered synonyms of other species. In a 1993 article which presented a revision of 167 species described by Rudow, German entomologist Klaus Horstmann described him as \\"undoubtedly the most incompetent\\" taxonomist of Ichneumonidae. Only eleven of the species names examined in the article were retained as valid names. Later that same year, Horstmann and Martin Schwarz published a revision of 67 species described by Rudow in the wasp genera Pezolochus and Pezomachus between 1914 and 1917; only two, Pezomachus haemorhoidalis and Pezomachus rificeps were retained.

She was killed by ex-boyfriend John Mack Herring (September 23, 1943\\"OBITUARY John Mack Herring September 23, 1943 ‚Äì January 5, 2019.\\"-January 5, 2019) at her own request in Winkler County, Texas. Herring was tried and acquitted for the killing after his lawyers argued that he had temporary insanity. The case ran in newspapers throughout the United States. Background Williams and Herring were both students at Odessa High School. Williams, who had counter-cultural views, was not considered popular, while Herring, an American football player, was considered to be popular. Williams engaged in sexual activity with boys she was not in a relationship with, something seen as taboo at the school. The two became lovers, but Herring later broke up with her. Williams asked multiple individuals to kill her, requests they took as jokes. Homicide and trial Herring killed Williams on March 20, 1961. Herring and Williams went next to a stock tank on his parents' hunting property in Winkler County, from Downtown Odessa. He shot her in the head with twelve-gauge shotgun, destroying much of it, attached weights to the body, and threw it into the tank. Herring stated that Williams chose the weapon he used to kill her. On March 22, 1961, she was reported missing, and Herring took police to the body after he was interrogated. Herring was tried for murder but was acquitted. His lawyers argued he had temporary insanity. He was tried twice, once in Kermit, Texas, in a hearing that was only meant to determine whether Herring was sane at the time. After a legal challenge the Texas Supreme Court stated that the judge lacked the authority to do so. A second trial was held in Beaumont, Texas, resulting in an acquittal. Aftermath Odessa High School staff did not provide counseling after the homicide occurred. Herring did not lose social status from the event, and instead town gossip maligned Williams, accusing her of leading him astray. Shelton Williams, a cousin of the homicide victim and an alumnus of Permian High School who played against Herring in American football games, wrote the book Washed in the Blood, published in 2006. The television program A Crime to Remember covered the case in its finale episode of its third season. Shelton Williams assisted the making of the program. Odessa High students reported ghost sightings and paranormal phenomena at the school for decades, up to 2006, centering around Betty Williams. Odessa High's administration applied paint to the school auditorium's windows to counter the ghost story culture. In 2019 CBS 7 Odessa stated \\"Many believe her ghost still haunts the halls of Odessa High School to this day.\\" Herring attended Texas Tech University and worked various blue collar jobs. He married twice, and both ended in divorce. Pamela Coloff of Texas Monthly stated that he appeared \\"utterly unremarkable\\", at odds with his appearance in his youth. Herring died on Saturday January 5, 2019, at the age of 75.

Other names for this are the systematic name 2,3-Aziridinedione or oxalimide. The chemical formula is C2HNO2. Its core is a three member heterocycle, aziridine. Production In 1886 Ost and Mente claimed to produce oximide by the reaction of oxamic acid with phosphorus pentachloride (PCL5). However, a product with a six member ring, tetraketopiperazine may have been produced instead. Later attempts to reproduce the production of oximide by this method were a failure. However the first successful manufacture of oximide was by Hiromu Aoyama, Masami Sakamoto, and Yoshimori Omote in 1980. Properties Aziridine-2,3-dione has an infrared absorption band at 1954 cm‚àí1. Related The term \\"oximide\\" has also been used for oximes. Derivatives of oximide exist where the hydrogen atom is substituted by other organic groups such as methyl or phenyl. When 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazolinedione is irradiated by ultraviolet light with wavelength 335 nm in a noble gas matrix, some methylaziridine-2,3-dione is made (along with isocyanates, carbon monoxide and dinitrogen). Similarly 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolinedione irradiated by ultraviolet light with wavelength 310 nm makes some phenylaziridine-2,3-dione. Shorter wavelength ultraviolet light decomposes these compounds to isocyanates (-NCO). Another method to produce oximide derivatives is by the photolysis of substituted diphenylmaleylimide ozonide at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) in a potassium bromide matrix. Derivatives made this way are methyl, isopropyl and phenylethyl-aziridine-2,3-dione. These compounds are unstable at higher temperatures, and when heated, decompose to carbon monoxide and isocyanates.

In accordance with the SFO, if it appears to the SFC that market misconduct or a breach of a disclosure requirement under Part XIVA of the SFO has or may have taken place, the SFC may institute proceedings before the MMT. The MMT conducts civil proceedings and, where appropriate, imposes civil sanctions against those it determines to be wrongdoers. It helps promote market confidence by protecting the interests of the investing public and reducing market malpractice. Chairmen The Chairman of the MMT is appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the Chief Justice. In its proceedings, the Chairman sits with two members who are prominent members of Hong Kong's business and professional community appointed by the Financial Secretary under the authority delegated by the Chief Executive. Every sitting of the MMT must be held in public unless the MMT considers, in the interests of justice, that a sitting (or any part of it) should be held in private. The following judges are currently appointed as Chairmen of the MMT: * Mr. Michael John HARTMANN, G.B.S. * Mr. Garry TALLENTIRE * Mr. Kenneth KWOK Hing-wai, S.B.S., S.C., J.P. * Mr. Michael Victor LUNN, G.B.S.

It is one of a series of such basins which developed across northern England in this period separating upstanding blocks which were typically underlain by buoyant granites. The basin trends roughly east‚Äìwest and is bounded by the Lake District block to the northwest, the Askrigg Block to the northeast and the Central Lancashire High to the south. One distinct section of the basin is a half graben which contains over 3km thickness of late Devonian to Courceyan strata and is referred to as the Bowland Sub-basin. These basins resulted from the crust of the region being subjected to a north‚Äìsouth lateral tension regime which began in the late Devonian and lasted through until the Visean. Fill The proven sedimentary fill in the Craven Basin starts with Courceyan age mudstones and limestones of the Chatburn Limestone Group, followed by the similar sediments deposited from Chadian to Asbian times and assigned to the Worston Shale Group. The basal part of this group is the Clitheroe Limestone which is unconformably overlain by the Hodder Mudstone. Completing the group are the Hodderense Limestone and Pendleside Limestone. The basin fill is completed by the Brigantian age Bowland Shale Group which comprises the Pendleside Sandstones within what is otherwise a mudstone succession. Craven Fault System The boundary between the Craven Basin and the Askrigg Block is defined by the Craven Fault System which comprises the North, Middle and South Craven faults. The last-named actually extends into the basin. There is a reef belt which runs along the line of the Middle Craven Fault between Settle and Cracoe.

Raised in Beijing, Gleysteen graduated from Yale University and began working for the United States Department of State in 1951. He served as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Korea between 1978 and 1981.  Early life  Gleysteen was born in Peking, China, to American parents who were Presbyterian missionaries, Theodora (Culver) and William Henry Gleysteen.http://iagenweb.org/boards/sioux/obituaries/index.cgi?read=364624https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/26/archives/theodora- gleysteen.html His paternal grandparents were Dutch. Gleysteen grew up in Beijing and attended the Peking American School. His father was principal of a large middle school for boys, where his mother also taught. Japan controlled Beijing starting in 1937, and after the Pearl Harbor attack Gleysteen and his family were eventually sent to an internment camp in Wei Xian, Shandong. They were repatriated to the United States in December 1943, after which Gleysteen finished his high school education and graduated from Westtown Friends School in Pennsylvania. After graduation he served in the United States Navy for two years, first as a student in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and later as an enlisted sailor.Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, June 10, 1997, \\"\\" At the end of the war, Gleysteen attended Yale University, where he majored in European intellectual history. He remained at Yale to complete a master's degree in international relations. While at Yale, Gleysteen was influenced by fellow students who were foreign service officers, as well as his older brother Culver, who was already a foreign service officer by that time.  Foreign service career  Gleysteen joined the State Department's Civil Service in 1951 as a clerk typist in the Executive Secretariat, during the time of Secretaries Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles. He was converted to a Foreign Service Officer in 1954 as part of a policy (‚ÄúWristonization‚Äù) adopted by Dulles designed to integrate the Foreign and Civil Services, which caused the Foreign Service to double in size in just four years.Office of the Historian, \\"\\" Gleysteen subsequently served in Taiwan (twice), Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, along with several assignments in Washington, DC. He spoke Mandarin fluently, having first learned it as a child and then studying it again in Taiwan before beginning his assignment.  Ambassador to the Republic of Korea  Gleysteen was nominated by the Carter administration to serve as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Korea. He arrived in Seoul in June 1978, and stayed until his retirement in 1981. While serving as Ambassador Gleysteen had to contend with several important events which deeply affected the bilateral relationship. The Koreagate scandal erupted during the 1976 U.S. elections when it came out that members of Congress had accepted bribes from South Korean agents in return for favorable treatment of Korean interests. This issue was still being investigated when Gleysteen arrived in Seoul in 1978. One of Gleysteen's first tasks as Ambassador was to convey a request from House Speaker Tip O‚ÄôNeill, which would give two House members access to former Korean ambassador to the United States Kim Dong-jo and alleged Korean agent Park Tong-sun. The furor died down several months later following the 1978 U.S. elections. Another issue during Gleysteen's tenure as Ambassador was President Carter's proposed withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula. Then-governor Carter had criticized South Korea's human rights record during his presidential campaign, and after assuming the presidency in January 1977, he directed that plans for a full withdrawal be drawn up. Gleysteen opposed the withdrawal and persuaded President Carter to reconsider the policy in a famous exchange in the President's limousine during a 1979 presidential visit to Seoul. Although the United States generally earned plaudits among South Koreans for its consistent criticism of political repression in the Park and Chun eras, Gleysteen said that those positive emotions were ‚Äúmuffled for many years by emotions and misinformation that mushroomed after the Kwangju Uprising in the spring of 1980.‚ÄùWilliam Gleysteen, Massive Entanglement, Marginal Influence, 1999 (pp. 53‚Äì76 of The Brookings Institution 2000 softcover edition) In his memoirs, Gleysteen said the Kwangju Uprising took place in the context of the long-running democratization movement as well as regional rivalry between the Cholla Province and Park Chung-hee's native Gyeongsang Province.William Gleysteen, Massive Entanglement, Marginal Influence, 1999 (pp. 127‚Äì143 of The Brookings Institution 2000 softcover edition) The proximate cause of the incident was a renewed and extended nationwide state of martial law declared by Chun, along with the arrest of democratization leaders, including Cholla native Kim Dae- jung. The uprising began on May 18 with a protest by approximately 200 students at the Chonnam National University. A series of violent skirmishes with the police quickly increased the number of protestors, and by May 20 the number of protesters had grown to 10,000. On May 21 a group of students, workers, and other citizens of Kwangju attacked government buildings, seizing weapons and ammunition. As the rebellion unfolded, Ambassador Gleysteen and General Wickham (commander of the United Nations Command at that time) criticized military and political leaders for their handling of the incident, and on May 21 the South Korean troops were withdrawn to the edge of the city, beginning a standoff which continued until May 27, when some 6,000 troops entered Kwangju, ending the rebellion. During the uprising but before the outbreak of serious violence, Gleysteen met with General Chun to urge restraint with regard to the student protests, and received multiple assurances that the Korean government was \\"very aware of the danger of over reaction and the use of military force,\\" and that \\"the president was determined to go to great lengths to avoid using the army except as an instrument of last resort\\". President Choi made a speech in June expressing regret for the violent turn of events, but he did not offer an apology, although Gleysteen said that he had encouraged him to do so.  Personal life  Gleysteen married his first wife, Zoe Clubb, in December 1952. They had three children together: Thea Clarke, Guy Gleysteen, and Michael Gleysteen. He married his second wife, Marilyn Wong Gleysteen, in 1981. They had one child together: Anna Wong Gleysteen.  Later career and death  Gleysteen retired from the State Department shortly after stepping down as ambassador. He was subsequently named director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Gleysteen died of leukemia on December 6, 2002, at the Washington Hospice.Department of State, \\"\\"  Notes  Category:1926 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the United States to South Korea Category:Yale University alumni Category:United States Navy sailors Category:Deaths from leukemia Category:Deaths from cancer in Washington, D.C.

Biography  Katherine was born in Kentucky, the only child of George Albert and Logie Bell Evans. As a young girl, she dreamed of becoming an actress, and she persuaded a family friend who was related to D. W. Griffith to get her an introduction when she moved to California at age 16. Griffith brought her onto his stock company, and she appeared in a few small roles on the stage and in silent films before deciding that acting wasn't for her. The family moved away from Los Angeles for a time. When she moved back to Hollywood in her early 20s, she began writing for publications like The Los Angeles Daily News and Photoplay before getting a job in MGM's publicity department. Early on in that assignment, she was charged with working with Greta Garbo, who she apparently didn't get along well with. At MGM, she met Dale Eunson, who later become editor of Cosmopolitan magazine. The pair married in 1931, and together, they collaborated on a number of short stories, stage plays (including Loco, which ran on Broadway in 1946-47), and screenplays. Loco was later used, together with Zoe Akins' The Greeks Had a Word for It, as a source for the 1953 film How to Marry a Millionaire starring Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall. They had a daughter, Joan Eunson (aka Joan Evans), named after Joan Crawford, who became an actress and entertainment journalist. Albert was encouraging of Joan's career, but preferred not to meddle: \\"I've had to work with a lot of movie mamas. Believe me, I want no part of that\\". She and Euson wrote most of their films and TV episodes after Albert suffered a major heart attack around 1950. During the 1950s and 1960s, they wrote half a dozen films and over a dozen TV episodes. They worked almost all the way up through Albert's death in 1970.

Each carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen. Production Reacting sodium oxamate (the sodium salt of oxamic acid) with hydrochloric acid yields some tetraketopiperazine. A higher yield result from reacting ethyl oxamate with sodium ethoxide. Yet another way to make tetraketopiperazine is a condensation of oxamide with ethyl oxalate with sodium ethoxide present. Excessive nitration of 2,6-diaminopyrazine ends up with tetraketopiperazine. Reactions The nitrogen atoms in tetraketopiperazine are slightly acidic losing their hydrogen atoms as ions. Salts of tetraketopiperazine exist. Tetraketopiperazine reacts with sodium bicarbonate to yield a monosodium salt. A disodium salt results from reaction with sodium hydroxide or sodium alkoxide. These are likely to be tautomeric with a hydrogen moving to an oxygen atom. Potassium salts also exist. A monosilver salt can be made from a silver compound and a dissolved tetraketopiperazine potassium salt. Ammonia and mercury salts of tetraketopiperazine also exist. Tetraketopiperazine also can form a monohydrazone. Reduction of tetraketopiperazine yields trikeopiperazine and then 2,5-diketopiperazine. Glyoxalic acid and oxamide are side products. Properties When heated tetraketopiperazine does not melt, but turns black at 250¬∞C. Tetraketopiperazine is slightly soluble in water. Tetraketopiperazine is soluble in boiling acetic acid.

He is the founder and managing director of Crescent Wealth, Australia's first Islamic wealth management company, that launched the country's first Islamic superannuation fund, the Crescent Wealth Superannuation Fund, and the country's first Islamic equities index, the Thomson Reuters Crescent Wealth Islamic Australia index. He holds an Honorary Professorial Fellowship at the Crawford School of Public Policy within the Australian National University College of Asia and the Pacific. Also, he served as Chairman of the Council for Australian-Arab Relations for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), a member of the board of DFAT's Australia Malaysia Institute, and a member of Australian Multicultural Council. For his works, he was named Professional of the Year in 2012 and Man of the Year in 2016 in the Australian Muslim Achievement Awards. In 2010, he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for his contribution to the country's business, education, and multicultural community.  Personal life and education  He is the eldest of eight children of Lebanese Muslims Ali, a poor tobacco farmer, and Fatma Yassine from the rural north of Lebanon. He was four years old when his family migrated to the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia in 1977 to escape the war in their country of origin. His father worked in a factory while his mother looked after the six boys and two girls. Education was prioritized in the household, although neither parents were highly educated and the family struggled financially. All of the children are professionals and have about 30 degrees between them. Attending Granville Boys High School from 1984 to 1990, he was elected as school captain and dreamed of becoming a lawyer, practicing the profession in the local community. At first, he went to study at the University of Sydney, then transferred to Macquarie University where he graduated with a law degree. He holds a Master of Laws, a Master of Business Administration, and completed his Doctor of Business Administration degree with a focus on international business strategy. In an interview by the Australia Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National on July 22, 2018, Yassine said that he's married with three daughters and a son.  Career  In 2010, he started working at the law firm Dunhill Madden Butler, which later merged with the accounting company Price Waterhouse Coopers in 2000. Later, he entered politics by putting his name down for Australian Labour Party's (ALP) preselection for the legislative seat of Auburn in 2001. ALP Premier Bob Carr, in his book, Run For Your Life, said that the party passed over Yassine amidst intense anti-Lebanese, anti-Muslim sentiments after a series of gang rape attacks were committed against women in Sydney by Lebanese Australian youths led by serial rapist Bilal Skaf a year before. Carr later characterized the decision as unfair and unjust to Yassine. However, Yassine stated in the ABC's RN interview that he was fortunate he did not push through with politics then as anti-Islamic rhetoric intensified when weeks after the 2001 election, the September 11 attacks occurred. Later, he worked in corporate finance and technical real estate divisions for the investment bank and fund manager Babcock & Brown for two years and quit before the company collapsed in 2009. Together with Ben Keneally, spouse of former New South Wales premier Kristina Kenneally, he co-founded the Australian division of electric car company, Better Place, and was responsible for the company's business development and strategic partnership. In mid-2011, he stepped back from the day-to-day management of the company while still holding financial interest. Yassine holds a seat in several corporate boards including as Executive Chairman of the Board at First Quay Capital and LandCorp Australia, Chairman of the Australian Advisory Board of Gulf Australia Corporation, formerly as chairman at Platinum Hearing, and a member of the Australian Arab Dialogue board.  Crescent Wealth  He founded and is the current managing director of Crescent Wealth, Australia's first Islamic wealth manager. In an interview by The Australian on February 15, 2013, he stated that after he failed to find investment products that would satisfy Islamic requirements and were available in Australia to be offered to Muslim investors back then, he established the company in partnership with the U.S. fund manager Saturna Capital to oversee international shares, with Sigma Funds to handle local shares portfolio, and with the Islamic finance subsidiary of HSBC Bank. On November 2010, it was granted the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's Australian Financial Services Licence. By 2011, it launched Crescent Australian Equity fund with $5.5 million of seed capital from Aon Hewitt targeting the retail market and self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF) in particular. Other financial products include the Crescent Islamic Cash Management Fund, the Crescent Diversified Property Fund, and Crescent International Equity Fund. The company also launched Crescent Wealth Superannuation Fund, the country's first Islamic superannuation fund, on December 17, 2012. Complying with Islamic guidelines, it does not invest in alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, pork, and financial stocks like banks due to a ban on interest charges. On February 1, 2012, Crescent Wealth in partnership with Thomson Reuters launched the Thomson Reuters Crescent Wealth Islamic Australia index, Australia's first Islamic equities index.  Civil service  Yassine's works in civil service were as a member of the boards of Sydney Ports, Sydney West Area Health Service, the New South Wales Casino Control Authority, and New South Wales Casino Liquor & Gaming Authority. Moreover, he served as non-executive director on the board of Australian Postal Corporation since August 2, 2012 until August 2015. He also was a member of the Council for Australian-Arab Relations for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for four years, serving as Chairman for three years, a member of the board of DFAT's Australia Malaysia Institute, and a member of the Australian Multicultural Council.  Academe and philanthropy  He is an adjunct Business School professor at University of Western Sydney and currently serves as an Honorary Professorial Fellow at Crawford School of Public Policy within The Australian National University. Additionally, he also served as board member of Whitlam Institute within Western Sydney University and Macquarie University. Moreover, according to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, he is affiliated the following philanthropic organizations: Crescent Foundation Fund Trust, Islamic Museum of Sydney Limited, Media Diversity Australia Limited, The Trustee For Whitlam Institute Within Western Sydney University Trust, and Whitlam Institute Within Western Sydney University Foundation Council Board.  Recognition  In 2010, he received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2010 for his services to business, education, and multicultural community. He received in 2012 the Professional of the Year Award from Australian Muslim Achievement Awards. Also, he won the Man of the Year Award on the 2016 Australian Muslim Achievement Awards, with Crescent Wealth winning Business of the Year Award and Event of the Year Award. During the 24th Sir Syed Day organized by Aligarh Muslim University Alumni of Australia on February 11, 2017, he was given recognition for his outstanding contribution to the community. He was included in The Muslim 500: The World's 500 Most Influential Muslims in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The Amendment does not make such reservations mandatory in State Government-run educational institutions or State Government jobs. However, some states have chosen to implement the 10% reservation for economically weaker sections. Currently, the quota can be availed by persons with an annual gross household income of up to . Families that own over 5 acres of agricultural land, a house over 1,000 square feet, a plot of over 100-yards in a notified municipal area or over a 200-yards plot in a non-notified municipal area cannot avail the reservation. Persons belonging to communities that already have reservations such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the \\"creamy layer\\" of Other Backward Classes are also not eligible for reservation under this quota. Legislative history The bill of Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act, 2019 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 8 January 2019 as the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019. It was introduced by Thawar Chand Gehlot, Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment. The bill sought to amend Articles 15 and 16 of the constitution. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 9 January 2019, the last day of the House's winter session. The bill received overwhelming support from the 326 members present with 323 votes in favour and only 3 members voting against. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the passage of the bill a \\"landmark moment in our nation's history\\". The Bill was tabled in the Rajya Sabha the following day. The House rejected 5 amendments proposed by members of the Opposition. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP Kanimozhi moved a motion, supported by Left parties, to refer the Bill to a parliamentary select committee. The motion was rejected receiving 18 votes in favour, 155 against, and one abstention. The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 10 January 2019 with 165 votes in favour and 7 against. The Bill received assent from President Ram Nath Kovind on 12 January 2019. It was notified in The Gazette of India on the same date. The 103rd Amendment came into effect on 14 January 2019. Constitutional challenge Within hours of the bill passing the Rajya Sabha, non-governmental organization Youth For Equality filed a PIL challenging the Bill in the Supreme Court. The NGO argues that the Bill violates the basic structure of the Constitution which they claim does not permit reservation based on economic factors. They also argue that a previous Supreme Court judgement had fixed the maximum reservation allowed under all quotas at 50%. The 103rd Amendment raises the total reservation quota to 59.5%. The DMK filed a motion in the Madras High Court challenging the Amendment on 18 January 2019. The party argues that reservations should be based on the community to which an individual belongs and not their economic status. On 8 February 2019, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi declined to pass a stay on the Amendment, but agreed to hear the petitions challenging the Amendment. Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal defended the government's position before a three judge bench of the Supreme Court on 31 July 2019 arguing that the 103rd Amendment was \\"necessitated to benefit the economically weaker sections of the society who were not covered within the existing schemes of reservation, which as per statistics, constituted a considerably large segment of the Indian population.\\" Venugopal noted that Article 46 of the Directive Principles of State Policy commands the State to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the population and protect them from social injustice. The Attorney-General also added, \\"In the country‚Äôs higher educational system, private unaided institutions play an important role providing education to over 1.34 crore students in various programmes. It is therefore essential that the socially and economically weaker section gets access to these facilities as mandated in the Constitution.\\" The bench led by Justice S.A. Bobde declared that the Court would reserve its orders and decide whether to refer the matter to a Constitution Bench. The Court declined to pass a stay order and the 103rd Amendment remains in effect. Implementation Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced that Gujarat would implement the 10% reservation policy beginning 14 January 2019, becoming the first state to implement the law. Telangana Chief Secretary S.K. Joshi said on 14 January that the state would also implement the Amendment, but would consider making some changes that differ with the Amendment.

Life  Vuk Vidor is the son of the painter, illustrator and engraver Vladimir Veliƒçkoviƒá and the older brother of artist Marko Velk. Born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1965, he studied architecture at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts de Paris-Tolbiac (Paris- Tolbiac National School of Fine Arts) and graduated in 1990. He shows several of his utopian and conceptual architectural projects alongside pioneers such as Zaha Hadid, Morphosis, Coop Himmelblau, Eric Moss... In 1992, Vuk Vidor decides to turn to painting. A series of drawing he started in 1989 and entitled \\" King Ink \\" often serves as the basis for his works.  Work  = Artistic practice = Vidor's work is characterized by its eclecticism. His reflexion about life and death is prominent in a series of paintings entitled \\" Ascendance \\" that depicts interconnected skulls. It is a way to represent emotional, historical or even cosmic connexions between beings. His works are full of irony. The \\" Everlast \\" series is about the 4 ages of life : childhood, Adulthood, old age and death. He works with several mediums, mostly painting and drawing, but sometimes sculpture or installation as well. In 2000 he contributed to an exhibition about the color red, symbolizing eros, blood and violence. In 2015, Vuk Vidor created an exhibition around a fictitious industrial and scientist, Thomas Jerome Newton, a character from the 1976 movie The Man Who Fell to Earth. He built a story around the character, pretending that he was about to give an interview to Time Magazine. He feigned to have had access to the character's archives and exhibited documents about him. David Bowie, who impersonates Thomas Jerome Newton in the movie, is omnipresent in the exhibition. Vuk Vidor had previously focused on another icon, the singer and musician Elvis Presley, whose name he had changed to ‚ÄòEvils‚Äô. Vuk Vidor has worked with musicians Goran Bregoviƒá and Marc Cerrone, and English rock band Duran Duran. He directed numerous music clips in Serbia in the 90s. In 2006, he directed a vido clip about greed for the launch of the Chrysler 300. = Committed art = Vuk Vidor is a committed and political artist. In 2003 he takes side for the Refugees in an installation called Serbia Remix Project. The subject of the installation is a blue, white, and red striped plastic bag. This bag is according to him, a common feature of every victim of modern conflicts. His work is fraught with historical references and frequently deals with the idea of war. He has built a gold statue of himself in an attempt to reflect both on his ego as an artist. and on Serbian nationalism. In a 2009 series entitled \\" American Quartet \\", he delivers his own vision of the United States. Through figures of weary Superheroes, he denounces the myth of the Frontier and the omnipotence of the US. Captain American becomes an Atlas-like figure, bearing on his shoulder not the world but the American Dream. Jesus is also part of the exhibition, but is shown crucified to Shareholders. The inspiration of his post 9/11 world comes from pop art and American comics ‚Äì a genre he likes to parody. He twists American symbols and turns heroes into useless villains. He exhibits his works in the United States to force Americans to face their contradictions. He intends to show that today \\" even super-heroes cannot save us \\". Generally speaking, his work constantly interrogates the place of humanity in the universe. = Conception of art = Vuk Vidor's vision of art is sometimes controversial. \\" Vuillard was better than Bonnard, same for Tapi√®s, Rauschenberg used to be better, Twombly has always painted crap, Bacon was better when he was alive. \\", he said in a 1999 manifesto-like work entitled \\" Art history \\". In 2007 he co-signed an editorial in the French newspaper L‚ÄôHumanit√©, criticizing how the French Ministry for Culture was contributing to create a normalized and monopolistic \\" official art \\". He spoke against the \\" masked puppeteers \\" who are imposing diktats of fashion and trends in the art world. He asked for a fair repartition of temporary exhibition spaces. His work is transgressive : he even directed erotic videos. In 2012, Vuk Vidor created the under-realist movement with Kosta Kulundzic, a Franco-American artist of Serbian origin, and the French artist St√©phane Pencr√©ac‚Äôh. The movement is a reaction against the over-conceptualisation of contemporary painting. For them, the image is more important than the idea. The under- realism is a grouping of artists who share the same vision of the artist's condition and are trying to free themselves from the diktats of market and trends.  Recognition  Vuk Vidor was awarded the Ito Ham Prize in 1986. He was awarded the International Painting Prize of Vitry-sur-Seine in 1996.

He was the first person to be executed in Cambridge following the end of public execution, and a dedicated building was constructed for his hanging. His conviction was notable for relying solely on circumstantial evidence. Murder of Annie Holmes In 1897 Horsford, aged 26, was a well-off farmer living in Spaldwick. He was in an intimate relationship with his cousin, Annie Holmes, a widow with three children. In October of that year, Horsford married another cousin of his, Bessie Mash. Shortly after this marriage, Holmes left Spaldwick and lodged in an inn in St Neots. In December she wrote to Horsford claiming she was pregnant. On 7 January 1898 Holmes received a postal packet from Horsford, and went to bed. An hour later her daughter heard Holmes screaming and found her in agony. Holmes died within a few minutes of a doctor arriving. At an inquest the following day Horsford stated he had not written to Holmes nor seen her since she left. When medical evidence pointed to strychnine poisoning, the police searched her bedroom and found two packets. One contained 30 grains of strychnine with the words \\"one dose, take as told\\" and the other was empty with \\"take in a little water, it is quite harmless\\" written on it. On 10 January Horsford was arrested for perjury at the inquest, and later that day further arrested for murder. The trial took place on 2 June 1898. At the trial it was stated that the impression of handwriting on the packages could be traced on a blotter on a desk in Horsford's home. Horsford had also purchased strychnine from a local chemist on 28 December 1897, claiming he was overrun with rats, and signed the register with his name. The jury did not retire but returned a guilty verdict immediately after the judge's summing up. Horsford was sentenced to death and executed on 28 June in Cambridge prison. Other murders Horsford was suspected of three other murders. The first was his former fianc√©e Fanny James who died in 1890 after claiming she had become pregnant, and after receiving a letter from Horsford. According to her family her symptoms were consistent with strychnine poisoning. However the inquest at the time recorded a verdict of death through eating a hearty meal. The second was a \\"girl from Peterborough\\" with whom he had been intimate, and who died after receiving a letter from him. The third case involved a man with the surname James who was a relative of Fanny James. Horsford supplied the usual beer to a group of men after working a day threshing wheat. He took James aside and gave him an extra quart, and he died in agony later that night. The inquest verdict recorded death from sunstroke, apparently without seeing the body.

He studied medicine in the 1970s and after his marriage and graduation left for Brazil in 1978 to work in the missions as a doctor. He tended to ill children and also to the lepers before being forced to return to Verona in 1982 after one of his daughters fell ill with malaria. He sought work there in a hospital where he remained until his death; just a month before he died he established the Comunit√† Regina Pacis in the hills. The beatification process for the late doctor launched in the 2000s and he became a Servant of God - the first stage on the road to sainthood. The cause reached a decisive point in mid-2017 after Pope Francis confirmed he lived a life of heroic virtue thus allowing for him to be titled as Venerable. Life Alessandro Nottegar was born in Verona on 30 October 1943 as the ninth of ten children to devout parents; one sibling was Teresa. His father sent him to a friar-run boarding school in the hopes that he would become a priest. Following high school he began theological studies but decided he did want to pursue the religious life or the priesthood. He instead decided to do medicine and so began a medical course at the college in Verona before he married Luisa Scipionato on 27 February 1971. The pair together had three children: * Chiara (b. 1972) * Francesca (b. 1975) * Miriam He graduated in 1977 and then in 1978 relocated with his wife and children to Brazil for experience in the missions there. He was one of the first doctors to have arrived in the missions to lend their medical expertise and tended to ill children. The arrival of more doctors over time in the area allowed for him to move to Rodonia in the Amazon rainforest area where he began working to help the lepers. The Bishop of Rio Branco Moacyr Grechi not long after asked him to move to a small village in an area where there was no doctor at all and he set himself on tending to the medical needs of the population there. Nottegar also taught the people there how to prepare some medicines on their own. But Nottegar was forced to return to Verona in 1982 after his daughter Chiara contracted malaria (added to his daughters' desire to see their grandparents again) where he found work in a lab in the Saint Bonifacio hospital. Nottegar also sold the lands inherited from his father before depositing the funds into a checking account thus later allowing him to purchase a large house in the Veronese hills. He later founded the Comunit√† Regina Pacis in the hills on 15 August 1986 and it would later spread to have seven communities in places like Grezzana and Budapest. Nottegar was returning home from the hospital in the afternoon on 19 September 1986 after he suffered a heart attack and so was rushed to hospital. His wife was taken to the hospital where the doctor handed her his personal effects (his glasses as well as his watch and wedding ring) just as his daughter Chiara arrived. His funeral saw 28 priests concelebrate the Mass. His remains are housed in his group's motherhouse in Verona. Beatification process The beatification process launched on 22 February 2007 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree thus providing their assent to the cause being opened and titling Nottegar as a Servant of God. The diocesan process opened in Verona on 14 May 2007 and concluded later on 6 June 2009 after a period of gathering evidence that could attest to Nottegar's reputation for holiness (writings or other documentation as well as witness interrogatories). The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan investigation in Rome on 23 April 2010 after confirming it adhered to their guidelines for conducting causes. The postulation drafted and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials in Rome on 21 November 2013. The theologians approved the cause after reviewing the dossier on 14 January 2016 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 4 April 2017. Nottegar became titled as Venerable on 4 May 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that Nottegar had practiced heroic virtue during his lifetime.

She is known for dramatic roles by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, including Br√ºnnhilde, Isolde, Ortrud, Kundry, Elektra and the Dyer's Wife, which she performed internationally.  Career  = Training and artistic beginnings = Born in Wuppertal, Vinzing first learned the profession of seamstress. She then took private singing lessons, first with Elisabeth Boeker in L√ºdenscheid. Without the knowledge of her family she continued her studies with Francesco Carrino in D√ºsseldorf. In December 1966, she won first prize at the first Bundeswettbewerb Gesang.,Alle Preistr√§ger*innen Oper/Operette/Konzert 1966-2016 Bundeswettbewerb Gesang, with Josef Greindl and Elisabeth Gr√ºmmer as jury members. She then received an audition from Wieland Wagner, who recommended her to Bernhard Klee, then Generalmusikdirektor at the Theater L√ºbeck, who made her a member of the ensemble.. In 1967, she made her debut at the Theater L√ºbeck in the role of Marie in Smetana's Die verkaufte Braut. During the following three years in L√ºbeck she worked on 14 leading roles. At first she was mainly used in the Italian repertoire, but sang these roles in German, as was customary at the time. Her L√ºbeck roles included among others Mim√¨ in Puccini's La Boh√®me, the title role in his Madama Butterfly, Desdemona in Verdi's Otello, Leonora in his Die Macht des Schicksals, as well as roles in contemporary repertoire, such as in Auff√ºhrung by J√°n Cikker and the Bride in Fortner's Bluthochzeit. In the latter production, she got to know Martha M√∂dl, from whom she subsequently received instruction in voice training and language treatment. In L√ºbeck she also performed her first Wagner parts: Elisabeth in Tannh√§user and Senta in Der Fliegende Holl√§nder. From 1971 to 1976, Vinzing joined the ensemble of the Opernhaus Wuppertal under the direction of Kurt Horres, where she expanded her dramatic roles.

She has worked exclusively as a freelance singer since. = Guest performances in Germany and Austria = From 1972 Vinzing performed extensively on German stages. During her engagement in L√ºbeck she appeared several times at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein. There she was especially successful as Senta, which she performed more than 100 times during her career. In 1972, she first appeared as Isolde in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde at the Theater Hagen. In 1973, she took over the Empress in Die Frau ohne Schatten by Richard Strauss at the Staatstheater N√ºrnberg, staged by Hans-Peter Lehmann and conducted by Hans Gierster, with Karl-Heinz Thiemann as the Emperor and Astrid Varnay as the Nurse. In 1976 she first appeared in the title role of Elektra by Strauss, with Anny Schlemm as Klyt√§mnestra, at the Staatstheater Hannover, where she appeared regularly. She made her role debut as Kundry in Wagner's Parsifal there in the 1981/82 season in a new production with Siegfried Jerusalem in the title role and Bent Norup as Klingsor.

In 1987, EMI released an unabridged studio recording of Die Frau ohne Schatten, with Wolfgang Sawallisch conducting.

Described as a powerful prophet, he led his people in revolt against the Anglo-Egyptian authorities in 1923. He was captured in 1925 but after swearing allegiance to the British was freed and placed in position as indirect ruler of his former territory. After the British district commissioner was murdered in 1927 a force led by Major Lionel Bostock captured Garluark once again. He was freed once more in 1935 and reinstated as ruler.  Life  Garluark has been described as a \\"powerful and influential prophet\\" of the Nuer people. Sudan was at the time under the control of an Anglo-Egyptian condominium and the British administrator for Garluark's territory was district commissioner Captain V. Fergusson. Initially, in 1922, Garluark refused to communicate with Fergusson however later that year he agreed to meet for negotiations which seemed to be proceeding well until Garluark left abruptly. In 1923 Garluark led the Nuer in the eastern portion of Bahr-al-Ghazal in rebellion against the Anglo-Egyptian authorities. British troops led by Fergusson were initially unable to put down the revolt, but in January 1925 he led a strong force through the Nyuong region which killed the Nuer and burnt their villages. Garluark was captured but, after swearing his allegiance, Fergusson set him free to rule the region on behalf of Britain. He was said to be much feared by the chiefs and sub-chiefs of the region owing to his links with the British. Fergusson was murdered in December 1927, allegedly on the orders of a local chief, but Garluark was blamed. A simultaneous uprising occurred by the Nuer of the Sobat River region. Two expeditions were launched against the Nuer, one to the Sobat River under Captain JR Chidlaw-Robert and one against Garluark under Major Lionel Bostock. Garluark's men were surrounded by ground troops and attacked by Royal Air Force aircraft. The campaign ended on 7 February 1928 and Garluark was captured and imprisoned at Malakal. Garluark was reinstated as an indirect ruler in 1935 after Fergusson's murderers had been brought to justice.

It is located in the direction of the Indus constellation, at a distance of circa 150 million light years. It was discovered by the English astronomer John Herschel in 1834 using a 47.5 cm (18.7 inch) reflector. NGC 7196 appears slightly distorted, with asymmetric outer isophotes. Asymmetry is also observed near the centre. The inner luminosity pattern resembles that of lenticular galaxies with circumscribing dust lanes, except that the feature is extremely close to the center.Sandage, A., Bedke, J.

He is a dissident, who fled to Australia in 2014 and subsequently gained Australian citizenship in March 2019. He was arrested on arrival in Thailand from Australia for a vacation in November 2018 on the basis of an Interpol \\"red notice\\" issued by Bahrain, and was held there pending deportation to Bahrain, which he opposed. There was a campaign urging Thailand not to extradite him until 11 February 2019, when the Thai Office of the Attorney-General dropped the extradition case against him at Bahrain's request. He was returned to Australia the next day and became an Australian citizen in the weeks thereafter. Life and career in Bahrain Al-Araibi was a professional footballer, playing as a defender for the Bahrain national football team and for local Manama club Al-Shabab. Al-Shabab spent years in Bahrain's top division and included a number of young players who had represented the country's various national youth teams. Al-Araibi was one of these, playing for Bahrain's Olympic team. As a 15-year-old in 2009, he had been spotted playing by a school teacher, whose suggestion to a local scout brought him to the attention of the BFA. In 2010 he was called up to the Under-17 squad. He was overjoyed, and saw the national teams as symbols of unity between the Shia and Sunni populations of the country. In 2009 his family lived in Jidhafs, a few kilometres west of Manama. He has a brother, Emad, who is imprisoned in Bahrain for the same offence as that with which Hakeem is being charged. Emad had come to the attention of authorities as an activist before the 2011 uprising, and one night at the end of 2011 police turned up at the family home at 3 a.m, looking for him. As Emad was not there, they took Hakeem, accused him of burning tyres, which he denied, and held him for three months, until February 2011 and the uprising was under way. The BFA targeted Al-Shabab, being a Shia club, and for almost a year after the revolution there was no football there. Eventually they demoted the club to the second division. After his arrest and detention in November 2012, Hakeem returned to play for Al-Shabab and in late 2013 was called up for the senior national team by the newly-appointed English coach, Anthony Hudson. In November 2013 al-Araibi travelled with the national team to Qatar for the 2014 West Asian Football Federation Championship, where the team drew 0‚Äì0 with Iraq on 28 December 2013.  Dissent and conviction  Al-Araibi spoke out against the persecution and torture of other footballers who had demonstrated against the ruling regime during the Bahraini uprising of 2011 (which was mostly led by Bahrain's majority Shia, as is al-Araibi, whilst the ruling family is Sunni). On his 19th birthday on 7 November 2012, walking on his way to a caf√© in Bahrain, he was picked up by Bahraini security forces. They accused him of vandalising a police station four days earlier, based on the supposed confession of his brother Emad, who allegedly told them that Hakeem had been part of a crowd of protesters who set upon the building with Molotov cocktails. The next day Al-Araibi told the public prosecutor he had been playing in a televised football match when the attack took place and denied the allegations. But his detention was extended for 45 days, during which he says security forces tried to torture a confession out of him. He told German broadcaster ARD \\"They spent three hours hitting me hard on my legs, while saying we will break your bones, we will destroy your future, you will never play football again with these legs.\\". He was then released on bail. =Details of alleged offence and the prosecution case= After fleeing the country, al-Araibi was tried in absentia for vandalism of Al Khamees police station in Manama on 3 November 2012, when, according to police, a mob of 150 people had attacked the building, throwing Molotov cocktails and smashing windows, which he denies, and sentenced to ten years in prison. Amnesty International describe this trial as \\"unfair\\". The alleged vandalism was said to have taken place at around the time that al-Araibi was playing in a televised football match. The time of the attack on the police station is key to Hakeem Al-Arabi's alibi. His brother said the attack took place at 6.30 pm, but Hakeem was playing in a nationally televised game for his club Al-Shabab at the Al-Muharraq Stadium from 5.30 pm to 7.20 pm, with the Bahrain Football Association, the Al-Shabab club and fellow players confirming this. Footage from the game broadcast by Bahrain Sports Channel 1 showing al-Araibi playing was also submitted. However prosecution said that the mob had gathered earlier and the attack had taken place at 8 pm and that Hakeem would have had enough time to leave the stadium after finishing the match and take part in it 40 minutes later. The Al Khamees police station is 20 km south-west of the stadium, across on the other side of the city, and it was a Saturday night. The entire case being brought by Bahrain is based on the alleged confession by his brother Emad to Bahraini police, which led to Emad's imprisonment. BIRD has said that Emad's testimony was obtained through physical and psychological duress.  Asylum and life in Australia Al-Araibi took his opportunity to flee the country when out on bail and playing football for the national team in 2013 in Qatar.NOTE: This must have been either in the 21st Arabian Gulf Cup in January 2013 or the Under-23s GCC Championship in August 2013 ‚Äì probably the former as it would have been soon after his detention. He fled first to Iran, then Malaysia, then Thailand and eventually, nearly six months later, to Australia where he sought asylum in May 2014. Since then, he has lived in Melbourne, marrying his wife (whom he had known since he was 17) and playing semi-professional football. He was granted refugee status in Australia in 2017, which allowed him to travel with documentation and the assurance of protection. He has played as a defender in several semi-professional football teams in Victoria, his current team being Pascoe Vale FC in Melbourne. =Speaking up about torture in Bahrain= Speaking to international media from Australia in 2016, al-Araibi said that Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim Al- Khalifa, a member of Bahrain's ruling royal family and then running for president of FIFA, should be investigated for possible involvement in the mass torture of pro-democracy athletes who had protested against the royal family during the 2011 uprising. Al-Araibi also accused Sheikh Salman of discriminating against Shia Muslims. Salman lost his bid for the FIFA presidency, but remains president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and is still a FIFA vice-president. =After return from Thailand: Feb 2019= On 27 February 2019 al-Araibi told of his ordeal in The Guardian, expressing his gratitude to all concerned for helping to secure his release and his relief at his return, but also of his belief that Bahrain will continue to pursue him. He also wrote of several cases of Bahrain's abuse of human rights, including the detention of activist Najah Yusuf and jiujitsu champion Mohamed Mirza, and his belief in the ability of sports bodies to apply effective pressure to bring about change.  Detention in Thailand  Al-Araibi and his wife flew to Thailand on 27 November 2018 for a belated honeymoon, but both were detained upon arrival at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport , at the request of Bahraini authorities, and in response to an Interpol red notice. The couple were moved to the Suan Plu immigration detention centre on 2 December. Al- Araibi's wife was later released and he was moved to Bangkok Remand Prison. Questions about the role of the Australian Federal Police in his arrest were raised after it was reported that the AFP, working as locally based Interpol, had notified Thailand of his arrival and did not flag his refugee status. However, this was denied in a later press statement given by the Australian government, which said that by Bahrain had issued the Red Notice on 8 November 2018. The statement said that on 30 November Interpol rescinded the Red Notice, which had been issued erroneously and contrary to Interpol's rules regarding refugees and asylum-seekers, upon advice from Australia. On 4 February 2019 al-Araibi arrived at the Bangkok court with his feet shackled together in front of many international supporters and news cameras, begging not to be sent back to Bahrain. However the Thai attorney-general's office ruled that Bahrain had a legitimate \\"criminal\\" case, and the court granted him 60 days, until 5 April, to submit his legal defence to stop his extradition to the country of his birth. He would have to remain in a Thai prison until his next court appearance on 22 April, after he was denied bail, when decisions would be made on permissible witnesses and the length of the extradition hearing. Al-Araibi's lawyer, Nadthasiri Bergman, said that it was \\"clearly a political case\\". On 11 February, he was released after Thai prosecutors dropped the case, arriving in Australia the following day. He was granted Australian citizenship one month later, on 12 March 2019. = Local and international campaigns and other responses = In response to al-Araibi's detention, Amnesty International, who have criticised the low level of human rights in Bahrain, pointed out that under international law, it is prohibited to return an individual to a territory when there is a reasonable fear that the individual will be at real risk of suffering torture or other serious human rights violations. Refoulement is considered a grave breach of a fundamental international human rights law. His case was widely reported on major news outlets throughout the world, and was compared to that of Saudi Arabian woman Rahaf Mohammed, who was detained in Bangkok on 5 January 2019 at the request of Saudi authorities after fleeing the country, but released after criticism on social media and United Nations intervention, after being granted asylum in Canada. Amnesty International Australia created a \\"Write for Rights\\" campaign for individuals to email Thai officials via their website, attracting 53,218 signatories as at 4 February 2019. The Australian government, Football Federation Australia (FFA), Professional Footballers Australia (PFA), and FIFA all called for his release and return to Australia. FIFA called for al- Araibi's return to Australia in early December 2018 in communications with the FFA (although did not issue a media statement until January), and the FFA called for his return to Australia on 10 December. Craig Foster, retired Australian captain, SBS Australia chief football analyst and PFA representative, campaigned on al-Araibi's behalf since news broke of his detention. He travelled to Switzerland to present a petition with more than 50,000 signatures demanding the release of the detained footballer and held talks with general secretary Fatma Samoura FIFA on 29 January 2019. He also spent time in Thailand speaking to al-Araibi's legal team and visited al- Araibi in prison. Foster's many tweets on the topic were widely shared and the hashtag #SaveHakeem has been trending on social media platforms. Foster was joined in Thailand by Francis Awaritefe, former Australian footballer, past Director of Football at Melbourne Victory and vice-president of FIFPro (International Federation of Professional Footballers), Awaritefe, who said on 4 February that the Australian government had done a good job so far, but more needed to be done. Foster said that football sanctions should be imposed on Thailand and Bahrain. Australian football teams joined Pascoe Vale FC club in calling for his release, staging protests, wearing armbands and stopping for a minute's applause at A-League games around the country. On 28 January 2019, Thai FA Cup champions football club Chiangrai United F.C. became the first Thai club to publicly support the detained footballer, club president Mitti Tiyapairat posting on the club's Facebook page and calling on its supporters to demand the Thai government meet its international obligations. On 29 January 2019 the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) called for al-Araibi's release, after being criticised for its inaction, although Sheikh Salman made no public statement himself. The chair of Football Federation Australia has been seeking a place on the executive of the AFC. On 4 February 2019, international football stars Didier Drogba and Jamie Vardy tweeted their support. After the Bangkok court's judgement on 4 February, Australia's ambassador-designate in Thailand, Allan McKinnon, urged the Thai Prime Minister to allow al-Araibi to return to Australia, saying that he had the power to intervene and release him at any time and should do so. Also present outside the courtroom were ambassadors and representatives from the US and European Union countries and FIFA, as well as human rights groups and advocates for al-Araibi. Representatives of 14 countries attended the hearing. The London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) disagreed with Thailand's decision and his conviction in absentia to 10 years‚Äô jail by Bahrain, saying that the documentation of al-Araibi's trial was full of \\"flaws and contradictions\\". On 6 February 2019, in the first instance of sporting sanctions, Australia's Under-23s Olyroos' pre-tournament camp to Thailand was cancelled by the FFA and alternatives were sought. Also on 6 February 2019, TwitterSports tweeted a snapshot of Trendsmap showing that there had been nearly 1 Million #SaveHakeem tweets from all over the world, showing a high concentration in Thailand. On 7 February 2019, a coalition of 57 Thai human rights and civil liberties groups, academics and leading legal figures called on the Thai government to release al-Araibi, citing the political character of the charges and the \\"persecution, torture, cruel treatment or a life- threatening situation\\" to which al-Araibi may be subject if he is extradited. =Australian government responses= In early December 2018, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said that she had raised the matter with her Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai, requesting that Al-Araibi be allowed to return to Melbourne as soon as possible. His status as a permanent resident allows him to remain in Australia indefinitely and to travel abroad, so long as he does not travel to Bahrain. On 30 January 2019 it was reported that Australian prime minister Scott Morrison had called upon his Thai counterpart Prayut Chan-o-cha a few days earlier in a letter, stressing that al-Araibi had been issued a permanent protection visa by Australia after a deliberate and considered process and that returning the footballer to Bahrain would infringe his rights under international human rights law. In late January, the office of Marise Payne said that her government was making \\"extensive efforts\\" on behalf of al- Araibi. On 5 February 2019 the Australian government urged Thailand to exercise its legal discretion to free the footballer, saying \\"Thailand's office of the Attorney-General has publicly confirmed that Thailand's Extradition Act allows for executive discretion in such cases. This was also confirmed by the prosecutor in the context of yesterday's hearing.\\". On 7 February 2019, in response to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs' press release on 6 February and Deputy Permanent Secretary Thani Thongpakdi's statements earlier in the day on 7 February, the Australian government issued a statement saying that \\"Australia never issued a Red Notice against Mr Alaraibi. This Red Notice was issued by Bahrain on 8 November 2018.\\" It went on to say that the Red Notice should never have been issued because of his status as a protected refugee; this was a breach of Interpol's regulations. The Australian government not initially being aware of this, in line with procedure notified Thailand of his travel. When they had become aware of the situation, they ensured the Red Notice was rescinded as soon as possible, on 30 November. Australian government representatives had said unequivocally on many occasions that al-Araibi should be returned to Australia as soon as possible.\\" =Thai government responses= On 5 February 2019, Thai prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha broke his silence on the issue, telling reporters not to \\"jump to conclusions\\" regarding the verdict and not to politicise the issue, commenting that the Foreign Ministry was working with both Australia and Bahrain to find a solution. Foreign minister Don Pramudwinai said Australia and Bahrain should negotiate a solution, with Thailand ready to mediate, and that \\"for now Hakeem will be under the care of Thai authorities\\". Australian PM Scott Morrison said that he had received a reply to his letter to Mr Chan-ocha, but had written to him again after being disturbed at the appearance of al-Araibi in shackles at the hearing the day before. The head of Thailand's prisons defended the decision to use leg restraints, after photos and video of al-Araibi in chains and prison garb dominated local media discussion panels. On 6 February, the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an eight-point press release, stressing Thailand's role as a disinterested party which had unwittingly become tangled in a dispute between Australia and Bahrain, but which as a sovereign country has \\"legal obligations and commitments to the international community\\". It expressed the hope that \\"Australia and Bahrain will have the goodwill to earnestly work together towards finding a win-win solution to this issue\\". On 7 February, MFA deputy permanent secretary Thani Thongpakdi said the Australian branch of Interpol had emailed the Thailand and Bahraini branches in the morning of 27 November to alert them to the fact that Araibi was travelling to Bangkok was subject to a Red Notice. Later that day the Thais had received a note from the Bahraini embassy informing them similarly that al-Araibi would soon be arriving in Thailand and that he had a Red Notice, and seeking their cooperation. Thongpakdi said that the Red Notice had been issued by Bahrain in August 2018. He also said that it was possible for the Thai Prime Minister to intervene in the case, but only after the extradition request has gone through court and all appeals had been exhausted. =Bahraini government responses= Bahrain has said little publicly about the case, but interior minister Sheikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa issued a statement condemning external interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain, saying that critics of Bahraini courts should remember that al-Araibi was released on bail and allowed to travel to Qatar to play for the national team. = Relationship between Thailand and Bahrain = Thailand is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, has a history of returning alleged criminals to their countries of origin, and has strong economic links with Bahrain. Academics and human rights groups raised the issue of the very close ties between the two countries, both financially and between the two royal families. Political leaders from each country, as part of a joint commission aimed at strengthening cooperation between their nations, last met in August 2018. According to Dr Aim Sinpeng, an expert in South-East Asian politics at the University of Sydney, the Thai and Bahraini royal families have always had a close relationship and the Bahraini royal family visits Thailand every year. He believes Thailand was stuck in a \\"no win\\" situation over Al-Arabi's detention, adding that Australia and Thailand also share close ties. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Surapong Tovichakchaikul had said in 2012 that the relationship between Thailand and Bahrain \\"was very close and strong\\" and also disclosed Bahrain Prime Minister was a \\"close personal friend\\" of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and had \\"donated roughly $2 million of his own money\\" to Thailand for flood relief. The latest new business venture between the two countries is a new Thai shopping centre in Manama, set to launch in the first half of 2019 and described as an opportunity for Thai small and medium-sized enterprises to reach a huge potential market of Saudi shoppers, said to be the biggest economic centre in Bahrain, with import and exports between the two countries expected to be worth around US$400m annually. =Freedom and aftermath = On 11 February 2019 it was announced by the Thai Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) that the extradition case against Al- Araibi had been dropped by the criminal court at Bahrain's request. No reason was given by the foreign ministry, but the decision was made under Section 21 of the Prosecution Act, which allows for cases to be dropped if not in the public interest, and he would be released and allowed to return to Australia as soon as possible. He was subsequently placed on a flight to Melbourne, landing there on 12 February and being welcomed by a huge crowd. On 18 February, the AFP and Home Affairs Assistant Minister Linda Reynolds were questioned in a Senate estimates hearing about the circumstances leading to al-Arabi's detention. Reynolds said that the outdated system for Interpol notices caused the delay in Home Affairs notifying the AFP of Al-Araibi's refugee status. AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin defended his staff, saying that the Australian Interpol NCB (National Central Bureau) adhered to the policies and procedures of Interpol, but that reviews were being undertaken to improve inter-agency co-ordination and reduce similar incidents in the future. He said that the NCB acted within 24 hours to rescind Interpol's red notice once it became aware of Mr Al-Araibi's status, and the Red Notice against Al-Araibi would never have been issued in the first place if they had known he was a refugee.

Qatar's largest seaport, Hamad Port, is located here. Etymology The first constituent, 'umm', is the Arabic word for mother and is a common prefix used to denote geographical features. 'Houl' is an Arabic term reserved for a type of snare. Historically, birds of considerable size were commonly caught here using traps, lending the area its name. Geography Strategically located to the immediate north of the Mesaieed Industrial Area and approximately south of Hamad International Airport, the area was chosen as a maritime hub for its suitable geography and close distance to Qatar's industrial and economic centers. History In 1895 the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi attempted to claim it as his western frontier but his claim was rejected by his superiors in the British government. J.G. Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf gives an account of Umm Al Houl in 1908, referring to it as \\"Dohat [bay] Umm al-H≈´l\\" and giving its location as 5 miles south of Al Wakrah.

Kaysan converted to Islam after the Muslim conquest of Persia and became a mawlƒÅ affiliated with the Urayna clan of the Arab tribe of Bajila. Early on, Kaysan allied himself with the Alid cause. He ultimately became a leader of the mawƒÅlƒ´ faction in the pro-Alid movement of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi (685‚Äì687 CE), serving as the head of the latter's personal guard. Kaysan was chosen for this role either due to the high level of trust al-Mukhtar placed in him or Kaysan's significant influence among the mawalƒ´ of Kufa. He was among the handful of al-Mukhtar's loyalists who secured the support of the prominent leader Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar for the pro-Alid movement. Kaysan also oversaw the punishments of the Arab nobles of Kufa, where al-Mukhtar was based, including Umar ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and Shemr ibn Ziljawshan, for their participation in the events surrounding the killing of Ali's son al-Husayn in 680. His reputation was such that a common expression, \\"Abu Amra has visited him\\", was used by the Kufan nobles to refer to anyone who was stripped of their wealth. His fate is not precisely known but he may have died during the Battle of Madhar, in which he again commanded the mawalƒ´ of al-Mukhtar's army, in mid-686 since there is no post-battle mention of him in the sources. The extinct Shia sect, the Kaysanites, is most likely named after Kaysan, although there are other opinions about the origin of the term as well. Kaysan is reported to have preached extreme views. He cursed all the three caliphs preceding Ali, declaring them infidels, and claimed that angel Gabriel visited Mukhtar although the latter could only hear Gabriel's voice and could not see him. He is alleged to have asserted that Ali had designated Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah as his successor as Imam, and that Hasan and Husayn were usurpers. According to Wilferd Madelung, this claim is likely to be a later fabrication.

Her mother, a math teacher, encouraged her to pursue studies in mathematics. Instead, Micu elected to study fine arts in high-school, and later at the Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca. She chose to study painting at a time when the trends in contemporary Romanian art favored photography, video, and conceptual art. Career Early in her career, Micu became known as a figurative painter, exploring body language and movement through informal portraiture, and incorporating paintings within paintings in her work. Her more recent work has focused on self-portraiture and the depiction of interior, personal spaces, which attempt to demonstrate that a woman approaching her 40s can live alone in an apartment and produce significant artistic output. Micu is a realist painter, working with photography, sketching, graphite drawings, and easel painting. She often takes snapshots of her apartment and studio, using the photographs as the basis of works that incorporate elements of still life, landscape, and self-portrait. Her artworks are celebrated for their attention to detail of every object in the painting, where \\"light is the star of the show\\".
