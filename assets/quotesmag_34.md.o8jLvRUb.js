He is an allrounder who bats left-handed and bowls slow left-arm orthodox deliveries. He plays for South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers. Youth career Andrews started his cricket career playing for the Darwin Eagles in the Northern Territory. He represented the Northern Territory in both Under-17 and Under-19 National Championships and started playing for South Australia Under-23s in the Futures League in 2012. Andrews also represented Australia at under-19 level, his best performance being a five- wicket haul against Zimbabwe in a thumping 147-run win. In total Andrews played 16 Youth ODIs for Australia, including at the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, taking 26 wickets. Domestic career Andrews made his one-day debut on 24 July 2014 for the Australia National Performance Squad against India A, as part of the Australia A Team Quadrangular Series in 2014. He scored twelve runs and took a wicket. For the 2014‚Äì15 summer he was given a rookie contract with South Australia and performed well in both the Futures League and in grade cricket for Woodville Cricket Club. During the grade cricket season he scored 469 runs at a batting average of 52.11 and took 26 wickets at a bowling average of 21.81. Thanks to his form his rookie contract was renewed for the 2015‚Äì16 summer. During the 2015 winter Andrews trained in England with Bashley Rydal on a scholarship. Andrews went on to play his first one-day matches for South Australia in the 2015‚Äì16 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, being included in the state's 14-man squad for the tournament. During the tournament he took 4/41, the best bowling figures for the match, in a big win over Cricket Australia XI that took South Australia into the elimination final. Overall he performed well, taking nine wickets from eight matches, and as a result he was included in the Cricket Australia XI squad to take on the West Indians in their tour of Australia, his first-class debut. His fortunes continued to improve and he made his Sheffield Shield debut for South Australia when their usual spin bowler, Adam Zampa had been selected to play for Australia in the Chappell‚ÄìHadlee Trophy, and he impressed with a four- wicket haul. South Australia made it to the Sheffield Shield final, but Andrews wasn't included in the team (he was there as their twelfth man) as they decided to play with four fast bowlers. After breaking into both the first-class and one-day teams for South Australia, Andrews was upgraded from his rookie contract to a full contract with the team, and rather than going back to England to train he went back to Darwin to play with the Darwin Eagles in the newly formed Darwin and Districts cricket competition. He spent most of the 2016‚Äì17 season playing in the Futures League, but was brought into the Adelaide Strikers team as an injury replacement for BBL06. He made his Twenty20 debut for the Strikers on 31 December 2016. He was brought into South Australia's Sheffield Shield squad for the Sheffield Shield final as a potential second spin bowler because the pitch at Traeger Park in Alice Springs is traditionally a spinner-friendly pitch.

It is a scheduled monument. The current house dates from 1908 following the destruction of the later portion of the mansion by fire, although the exterior of the original building is almost intact. History Margaret Scott, heiress of Monzie, deeded three-quarters of the lands in 1613 to her son, James Graeme, who later built a house on the property.Gifford, p. 540 It may have incorporated a earlier fortalice as there are garderobes in the walls of the west wing. The estate was sold to Colin Campbell of Lagvinshoch in 1666 and his descendant, General Alexander Campbell, MP, enlarged the house by adding a much larger castellated building on its east side in 1797‚Äì1800 that was designed by John Patterson. The house was inherited by Charles Maitland-Makgill-Crichton in 1900. The interior of the addition was gutted by a fire in 1908 and rebuilt by Sir Robert Lorimer over the next four years in his own style.Gifford, pp. 540‚Äì541 Description The original house was a rubble-walled three-storey building built in a L-shape.

Born in Pennsylvania, Will studied medicine in a town in the western portion of the state before moving to Illinois. His farm in Jackson County, Illinois became the first county seat there. Will co-authored the Constitution of Illinois in 1818 and then served in the Illinois Senate for the 1st Illinois General Assembly. Will remained in one of the two houses of the general assembly until his death. The following year, Will County was named in his honor. Biography Conrad Will was born near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 3, 1779. He was the sixth of ten children born to Daniel and Maria Will. As a youth, Will helped his father on the family farm. He attended a subscription school during winters and took an interest in medicine. He attended a medical school in Philadelphia and graduated with a doctor's degree. He moved west to Somerset County, Pennsylvania to establish a practice. In the early 1810s, Will decided to strike out as a pioneer and decided to visit the Illinois Territory. Impressed with the region, he returned home then moved his family to Kaskaskia. Arriving in the spring of 1815, he found a suitable location on the Big Muddy River in southern Randolph County to live, building a double room log cabin. He obtained a license to practice medicine for around him. In 1816, Will purchased some kettles and began to manufacture salt from a spring near his farm, but the venture was unsuccessful. When Jackson County, Illinois was created later that year, Will's farm was named the county seat as Brownsville. Will was named one of the first county commissioners. Will was one of two representatives from Jackson County at the Convention of 1818, which wrote the first Constitution of Illinois. Following its approval, Will was named the first state senator from the county, making him one of the fourteen at the 1st Illinois General Assembly. The next term he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, where he served until returning to the Senate in 1828. While serving in the House of Representatives in 1823, Will issued a minority report in response to Governor Coles' request for legislation to eliminate slavery in the state; Will argued that Illinois lacked the authority to abrogate slavery and recommended that the state convene a constitutional convention in which delegates might remove restrictions on slavery as they saw fit, repeatedly urging the possibility of expanding slavery within the state.Illinois Gazette, January 18, 1823. He served in the upper house until his death in 1835. Will married Susanah Kimmel in 1804. In his free time, Will liked to hunt. He also collected timber, soil, flowers, and fruits. He died near Brownsville on June 12, 1835. The following December, the Illinois General Assembly unanimously passed legislation dedicating thirty days of mourning in the assembly. On January 12, 1836, the legislature created a new county from the lower portion of Cook County. The new county was named Will County in his honor.

The inscriptions include three Egyptian hieroglyphic stelae from Pharaohs including Ramesses II, six Cuneiform inscriptions from Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian kings including Esarhaddon and Nebuchadnezzar II, Roman and Greek inscriptions, Arabic inscriptions from the Egyptian Mamluk sultan BarquqBritannica Al Kalb River and the Druze prince Fakhr-al-Din II, a memorial to Napoleon III's 1860 intervention in LebanonCommemorative stela of Nahr el-Kalb at Livius.org and a dedication to the 1943 independence of Lebanon from France. As such, the site has been said to summarise all of Lebanon's history in one place.UNESCO Memory of the World application The earliest European to identify the site was the 17th-century traveller Henry Maundrell in 1697, and Franz Heinrich Weissbach was the first editor of the inscriptions in 1922. In 2005, the stelae at the river were listed in the UNESCO Memory of the World initiative. Description Map of the inscriptions, 1887. The number 1-9 are Egyptian inscriptions (square numbers) and Assyrian (circled numbers). The Babylonian inscriptions is on the north bank (small oval sign) and on the western road is the Roman inscription (the letter S and small arrow). Past generals and conquerors have traditionally built monuments at the mouth of the Nahr al- Kalb. Ramses II, Nebuchadnezzar, Esarhaddon, Caracalla, and even armies from modern-day France and Great Britain have engaged in this practice.Fisk, Robert. Pity the Nation: The Abduction of Lebanon. New York: Nation Books, 2001, pp. 52‚Äì53. The inscriptions are carved on a strategic location commanding the North-South coastal road along the Eastern Mediterranean. The earliest inscription is that of Ramesses II, and relates to the New Kingdom of Egypt's control of the region. The earliest Egyptian incursions into the region were many centuries earlier, as recorded by the Autobiography of Weni (c. 2280 BC)\\"Inscription of Uni\\" in Ancient Records of Egypt by James Henry Breasted, 1906, Part One, sections 291‚Äì294, 306‚Äì315, 319‚Äì324 and the Sebek-khu Stele (c. 1860 BC).The stela of Sebek-khu, the earliest record of an Egyptian campaign in Asia (1914) The earliest European to identify the site was the 17th-century traveller Henry Maundrell in 1697, who wrote of the river crossing: > To accommodate the passage, you have a path of above two yards breadth cut > along its side, at a great height above the water; being the work of the > emperor Antoninus... The memory of which good work is perpetuated by an > inscription, engraven on a table plained in the side of the natural rock, > not far from the entrance into the way... In passing this way, we observed, > in the sides of the rock above us, several tables of figures carved; which > seemed to promise something of antiquity... as if the old way had gone in > that region, before Antoninus cut the other more convenient passage a little > lower. In several places hereabouts, we saw strange antique figures of men, > carved in the natural rock, and in bigness equal to the life. Close by each > figure was a large table, plained in the side of the rock, and bordered > round with mouldings. Both the effigies and the tables appeared to have been > anciently inscribed all over: but the characters are now so defaced, that > nothing but the footsteps of them were visible; only there was one of the > figures that had both its lineaments and its inscriptions entire. Inscriptions =Egyptian inscriptions= Three Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions are known, all of which bear the cartouche of Ramses II. This was first identified by Karl Richard Lepsius. At least one of these is thought to have been placed during the Pharaoh's first campaign in the Levant, and set the Nahr al-Kalb as the border between Egypt's province of Canaan and the possessions of the Hittites. However, the inscription is so weathered that only the name Ramesses II and the date \\"year 4\\" can be read. Scholars such as Edward Robinson connected the Ramses II inscriptions to Sesostris, the Egyptian Pharaoh mentioned by Herodotus, in reference to Herodotus's note that \\"The pillars which Sesostris of Egypt set up in the various countries are for the most part no longer to be seen extant; but in Syria Palestine I myself saw them existing with the inscription upon them which I have mentioned and the emblem.\\"Herodotus, The Histories, Book II, 106 =Assyrian and Babylonian inscriptions= Six cuneiform Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian inscriptions are known. The Esarhaddon stele refers to Esarhaddon's seizure of Memphis from Egyptian Pharaoh Taharqa in 671 BC. The passage is badly damaged, but is understood to include reference to the cities of Ashkelon and Tyre, as well as Taharqa and 22 vassal kings. One inscription is attributed to Nebuchadnezzar II.Rocio Da Riva, The Nebuchadnezzar Inscription in Nahr el-Kalb pp. 255‚Äì302 in: A. ‚ÄìM. Afeiche (ed.) Le Site du Nahr el-Kalb, BAAL Hors Serie 11. Beirut: Ministry of Culture, Republic of Lebanon 2009} A plaster cast of one of the Assyrian inscriptions became the first relic of the ancient Assyrian empire to be brought to the United Kingdom, having been prepared by Joseph Bonomi the Younger in 1834. =Classical antiquity inscriptions= A number of Greco- Roman inscriptions were carved at the site. The most significant of these is attributed to the Legio III Gallica of Roman Emperor Caracalla (211‚Äì217 AD), who was of Punic and Syrian descent and whose official name was \\"Marcus Aurelius Septimius Bassianus Antoninus\\". The inscription relates to the road his forces there. The inscription includes the words \\"Lyco Flumen\\", which provided scholars such as Edward Robinson to conclude that the Nahr el-Kalb was the ancient Lycus river. Two of the inscriptions are in Greek, one of which still can be read as commemorating road or engineering work left by Proclus, Byzantine governor of Phoenicia in 382 AD under Theodosius I (379‚Äì395 AD). =Islamic inscriptions= Two Arabic inscriptions are known. The earliest was dedicated to the Mamluk sultan Barquq (1382‚Äì1399). An inscription dedicated to Emir of Lebanon Fakhr-al-Din II (1572‚Äì1635) was noted by Henry Maundrell in 1697, but by the 19th century this inscription was no longer legible. =Colonial inscriptions= The first colonial memorial is dedicated to Napoleon III's 1860‚Äì61 intervention in Lebanon. Two inscriptions (1919 and 1930) mark the Pursuit to Haritan, when the Allied forces took Damascus, Homs and Aleppo in October 1918 towards the end of World War I. The first inscription is dedicated to Harry Chauvel's Desert Mounted Corps, and the second to the Australian, New Zealand, Indian, and French contingents, as well as the Sharifian Army of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca. In October 1918, an inscription was carved to mark the British and French occupation of Beirut and Tripoli, during the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. The next inscription was left by French troops under General Gouraud, of the French Fourth Army, who took Damascus in July 1920 in the Battle of Maysalun. General Gouraud proclaimed the establishment of the State of Greater Lebanon on 1 September 1920. In 1942, the Allied forces \\"cut in the face of the cliff an inscription commemorating the freeing of Syria and the Lebanons\\" from Vichy France.Jungle warfare with the Australian Army in the South-West Pacific. Canberra: Australian War Memorial, 1944, p1 =Lebanese inscription= In 1946, a monument was erected in celebration of the independence of Lebanon from France, which came in 1943. In 2000, Lebanese demonstrators, including supporters of ex-general and current politician Emile Lahoud, erected a monument to marking the departure of Israeli troops from Lebanon.Robert Fisk Who's Running Lebanon, \\"There are the remains of Roman, Phoenician, Crusader, Mameluke, Ottoman, French and British armies ‚Äì along with the Australians, we \\"liberated\\" Beirut from Vichy France in 1941 ‚Äì and even a modern inscription recording the Israeli army's retreat from this country in 2000, placed there by Siniora's nemesis and Syria's best friend, the current President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon.\\" UNESCO Memory of the World In 2005, the stelae were accepted into the UNESCO Memory of the World initiative. The application stated that the stelae \\"sum up the entire history of Lebanon, from High Antiquity to the present, evoking clearly the successive advances of the Pharaonic, Assyro-Babylonian, Greek, Roman, Arab, French and British armies which braved all the obstacles surrounding this difficult and very steep crossing point to carve commemorative stelae on the rocks.\\" Gallery Notes References  UNESCO Memory of the World: Commemorative stela of Nahr el-Kalb .

He made his first-class debut on 30 October 2013 for South Australia against Queensland and played a series of List A matches for the National Performance Squad in 2014. He is the younger brother of fellow cricketer James Smith. Domestic career Smith made his first-class debut at the age of 19 in a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland on 30 October 2013. He batted at number 5 with and made scores of 1 and 12. In three matches during the season he scored 100 runs at an average of 20.00, including his maiden first-class fifty against Western Australia. In 2014 Smith was part of the National Performance Squad, playing five matches in the Australia A Team Quadrangular Series. He was named as the Adelaide Strikers' community rookie for BBL04, but after an injury to pace bowler Chadd Sayers he was promoted to the senior list. He made his Big Bash League debut in January 2015 against the Melbourne Renegades with a solid 41 runs not out from 34 balls to help the Strikers win the match. He then regained his spot in South Australia's Sheffield Shield side for the remaining five matches of the season. He scores two fifties and averaged 28.10. At the age of 19 he also became the youngest ever captain of the West Torrens Cricket Club. Smith signed a two-year contract with the Strikers for the 2015‚Äì16 and 2016‚Äì17 seasons. His form wasn't good enough in the 2015‚Äì16 season to consistently make it into the Sheffield Shield side. He only played three Sheffield Shield matches, scoring just 103 runs with an average of 17.16 and playing the rest of the season in the Futures League where he averaged 31.22. He didn't play any matches in BBL05. Smith prepared for the 2016‚Äì17 season in the West End Premier League playing for the Western Grit and scoring a century against the Northern Territory Strike. He made his mark early in the season proper with a double century in the opening match of the Futures League against the ACT side, after which he opened the batting with Jake Weatherald in the first half of the 2016‚Äì17 Sheffield Shield season, getting his highest score for the season with a 62 against Tasmania. He had poor form, only averaging 22.25 runs per innings, and in his only match for BBL06 he was out for a 3-ball duck. He went back to the Futures League and scored a century in his first match back against Tasmania, finishing the tournament with an average over 50.

Separation of Motivational Intensity and Valence  In psychology, the term valence is used to describe stimuli, events, situations and emotional states that are intrinsically attractive (positively valenced) or intrinsically aversive (negatively valenced). The valence of a stimulus or event tells us whether we are likely to approach or avoid it. Valence, however provides no information about the strength of this tendency as it is either positive or negative. Instead, the strength of this association is quantified as the Motivational Intensity. By analogy, the valence of a stimulus or event is like the sign of a correlation coefficient and its motivational intensity is like the coefficient magnitude. It has been suggested that valence ratings in normative data sets such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) might be used as proxies for motivational intensity. However, valence and motivational intensity do not always go hand in hand with one another. For example, viewing a positively valenced picture of a cute cat is associated with low motivational intensity because participants like it but are not intrinsically driven towards it. In contrast, viewing a positively valenced picture of a dessert is associated with high motivational intensity because participants want and desire it. Valence and motivational intensity can be at odds with one another with negatively valenced stimuli as well.  Separation of Motivational Intensity and Arousal  Motivational intensity and arousal are related, but are considered to be separate ideas; arousal has implications for action, but motivational intensity does not and it is possible to experience high levels of arousal, but not experience motivational intensity (e.g., laughing). Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants‚Äô to view pictures and then complete an attention task. Half of the participants pedaled on a stationary bicycle (to induce high arousal), while others did not. Results demonstrated that there was no difference in performance on the attention task with high or low levels of arousal, but pictures high in motivational intensity narrowed attention, compared to pictures that were low in motivational intensity.  Motivational Intensity, Valence and Attention  According to motivational intensity theory, high approach motivational intensity will narrow attention and conversely, low motivational intensity will broaden attention. This theory is at odds with a more traditional explanation of the effects of affect on cognitive scope, which suggest that positive affect broadens attention and negative affect narrows attention, respectively. = Measurement and Manipulation of Motivational Intensity = Motivational intensity has been experimentally measured and manipulated in a variety of contexts as highlighted below.  Film Clips  Gable and Harmon-Jones examined the effects of high and low motivational intensity on the scope of attention. Motivational intensity was manipulated using film clips. Half of the participants watched a film showing cats to induce low motivational intensity. Half of participants watched a film showing appetizing desserts to induce high motivational intensity. After watching the film, participants completed a Kimchi and Palmer task to measure their scope of attention. Results showed that participants experienced narrowing attention following the high, but not the low motivational intensity film.  Goals  Hart and Gable examined the effect of low and high motivational intensity on positive affect. Participants were either asked to write about a positive event where someone was kind to them to induce low motivational intensity, write down a goal they want to accomplish and the steps it will take to accomplish it to induce high motivational intensity, or write about a typical day in their life, as a neutral control condition. Results indicated that high motivational intensity positive affect lead to more successful goal pursuit and occurred only when task goals were explicitly stated. No effect occurred in the neutral condition, which suggests that motivational intensity alone did not impact goal pursuit.  Monetary Incentive  Gable and Harmon-Jones have manipulated motivational intensity using a delayed monetary incentive paradigm. Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants to respond to shapes that were presented on a computer screen. Half of the participants were told that participants could gain money when circles, but not squares appeared on the screen (pre-goal; high motivational intensity). Half of the participants were not given this instruction. Next, neutral words were presented either centrally or peripherally on the screen. Participants then completed a goal- related flanker task, where they were told that if they were faster than average on each trial, they could gain money on that trial (post-goal; low motivational intensity). Finally, participants‚Äô memory for the words was tested. Results suggested that compared to the neutral condition, high motivational intensity (i.e., pre-goal) lead to better memory for centrally presented information and low motivational intensity (i.e., post-goal) lead to better memory for peripherally presented information. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated using desirable (e.g., desserts) and neutral pictures.  Pictures  Pictures varying in high and low motivational intensity have been used in a variety of different studies including time perception. Poole & Gable asked participants to judge if pictures that were either high or low motivational intensity, appeared for long or short amount of time. Pictures were high (e.g., pictures of desserts), or low (e.g., pictures of flowers) in motivational intensity or neutral images (e.g., geometric shapes) and have been used in previous experiments to induce motivational intensity. Results demonstrated that participants‚Äô perception of time was shorter when high motivational intensity pictures were presented compared to low motivational intensity or neutral pictures. Gable and Harmon-Jones (Experiment 2) used a neutral picture (e.g. rocks) or a high motivational intensity picture (e.g., dessert) appeared followed by the Navon letter task to measure attentional scope. Results indicted that participants‚Äô attention was narrowed following the high motivational intensity pictures, compared to the low motivational intensity pictures. Gable and Harmon-Jones (Experiment 3) first measured overall approach motivation of participants using Carver and White‚Äôs (1994) Behavioral Inhibition Scale and Behavioral Activation Scales. Participants were presented with the dessert pictures used in Experiment 2 to induce high motivational intensity and baby pictures to induce low motivational intensity. Results showed that participants with higher Behavioral Activation scores in the beginning of the experiment showed more evidence of attentional narrowing following high motivational intensity pictures of desserts. Gable and Harmon-Jones (Experiment 4) manipulated motivational intensity using pictures and participant‚Äôs expectancy to act. Participant‚Äôs viewed high motivational intensity pictures (e.g., desserts) or neutral pictures (e.g., paper plates) and half of the participants who viewed the high motivational intensity pictures of desserts were given the expectation that they would eat the desserts later, while the other half were not. Following the viewing of the pictures, participants completed the Navon letters task to measure the scope of attention. Results suggested that participant‚Äôs attention narrowed the most when they viewed high motivational intensity pictures and were expected to consume them. This expectancy to consume the desserts showed further narrowing of attention than viewing high motivational intensity pictures alone. Gable and Harmon-Jones induced motivational intensity using photos from the International Affective Picture System.Lang, P. J., Bradley, M. M., & Cuthbert, B. N. (2005). International affective picture system (IAPS): Affective ratings of pictures and instruction manual. NIMH, Center for the Study of Emotion & Attention. Pictures were negative or neutral. One picture was presented followed by one trial of the Navon letters task to measure scope of attention. Results showed participants attention was broadened following low motivational intensity pictures, compared to the neutral picture. Experiment 2 was identical to experiment 1, but pictures high motivational intensity negative pictures were used. Results showed a narrowing of attention following these type of pictures. Liu and Wang used the same high and low motivational intensity pictures used in previous studies along with neutral pictures to examine the effects of motivational intensity on cognitive flexibility. Results showed that low motivational intensity increased cognitive flexibility and high motivational intensity reduced flexibility. Neuropsychological measures have been used in previous research to measure participant‚Äôs neurological responses while they view high and low motivational intensity pictures  See also  *Affect (psychology)#Motivational intensity and cognitive scope *Reinforcement sensitivity theory References Category:Motivational theories ","title":"Motivational intensity"},{"id":"43668148","text":"Nawa Nagatoshi (ÂêçÂíåÈï∑Âπ¥) (died August 7, 1336) was a Kamakura Period military figure who defended the Southern Court during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period.

The name also applies to at least three other forts built at almost the same location, one during the Texas Revolution, and two during the Civil War. In response to fear of annexation of Texas by the United States during the era of Mexican Texas, the Mexican Congress passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which halted legal immigration by Americans and established military occupation. Initially, sporadic efforts were made to establish a customs post at this location in 1830 and then again in 1831, but these efforts were less than successful. As a result, \\"Fortaleza de Velasco\\" was erected in April to May 1832 by the order of General Ter√°n to enforce the customs and immigration provisions of the new law for the customs port of entry. The original Fort Velasco has been briefly described in several first-hand or contemporaneous accounts. William J. Russell wrote ‚Äú‚Ä¶ The plan and structure of the fort were well understood, of circular form, of logs and sand, with strong stakes, sharpened, and placed close together, all around the embankment. In the center, stood a bastion, in height considerably above the outer wall, on top of which was mounted a long nine-pounder, worked on a pivot, and around which, on top of the bastion, was a parapet made of wood, about two feet in height.‚ÄùRussell, William J.

Barnes & Company, 1875, pp. 30-34; also printed in Frontier Times, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Oct 1933). pp. 531-535 Edwin Waller described it as \\"‚Ä¶ fort of circular form, having in the center a mound or raised platform of earth, whereon the artillery was placed en barbette, so as to fire over the outer wall, and command a range on every side. This outer wall was surrounded by a fosse or ditch, and perhaps something intended for chevaux de frize or abattis.\\"Peareson, P. E.; Reminiscences Of Judge Edwin Waller, The Quarterly of The Texas State Historical Association, Vol. IV (4), No. 1 (Jul 1900), pp. 33-53, reprint of a pamphlet entitled ‚ÄúSketch Of The Life Of Judge Edwin Waller‚Äù published at the Galveston News office in 1874, and apparently also copied into the Biographical Encyclopedia Of Texas, pp. 60-69, Southern Publishing Co. (New York) 1880 John H. Brown (whose father was in the Battle of Velasco) wrote ‚Äú‚Ä¶ The fort at Velasco stood about a hundred and fifty yards both from the river and the Gulf shore which formed a right angle. It consisted of parallel rows of posts six feet apart, filled between with sand, earth and shells, for the outer walls, Inside of the walls was an embankment on which musketeers could stand and shoot over without exposing anything but their heads. In the center was an elevation of the same material, inclosed by higher posts, on which the artillery was planted and protected by bulwarks.\\"Brown, John H.; History Of Texas From 1685 To 1892, Volume I, Becktold & Co. (St. Louis), 1892, especially pp. 178-183 Soon after its construction, the fort was the site of a skirmish called the Battle of Velasco in the period of June 25-29, 1832, as one episode of the Anahuac Disturbances, which was an early indication of unrest leading up to the Texas Revolution. After an overnight battle, the Mexican forces inside the fort surrendered (primarily due to lack of ammunition) to the Texian forces besieging the fort, and an armistice was signed on June 29, 1832, with the Mexican forces being paroled back to Mexico. Although the armistice agreement called for them to be transported by sea to Matamoros, the lack of a seaworthy vessel resulted in the troops marching overland via San Felipe de Austin and La Bahia back to Matamoros. After the battle, the fort was abandoned, and was probably scavenged for materials as the new town of Velasco grew up around its location. In the period of late 1835 and early 1836, as the Texas Revolution began, a new fort was constructed nearby mounting several large cannon, known as the best protected location on the coast. This fort was occupied for an extended period, at least through 1840. After the Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the independence of Texas on April 21, 1836, the newly formed \\"interim\\" government chose to establish itself at Velasco, due to available accommodations, and the protection offered by this fort and the newly built and robust Republic Of Texas Navy in the period of May to Oct-1836, when the government moved to a new capital at Columbia, as new elections resulted in the first \\"permanent\\" government. This second Fort Velasco was eventually abandoned after 1840 and was longer in existence by 1852. During the early part of Civil War, an early fort (also named as Fort Velasco) was built near the location of the Republic Of Texas fort, mounting two 18-pound cannon, but was augmented in the winter of 1863-1863 by a larger stacked-earth emplacement with five gun platforms known as Fort Sulakowski or Fort Velasco, at a point nearer the existing town. Armament consisted of one 30-pound Parrot gun, one 32-pounder Navy gun, one 24-pound and one 18-pound Sea coast guns, and one 12-pounder.Freeman, Martha D.; A History Of Civil War Military Activities at Velasco and Quintana, Brazoria County, and at Virginia Point, Galveston County, Texas, Prewitt & Associates, Reports of Investigations, Number 103, Apr 1995 References Velasco Category:Mexican Texas Category:Texas Revolution Category:Buildings and structures in Brazoria County, Texas Category:1831 establishments in Mexico ","title":"Fort Velasco"},{"id":"43668197","text":"Kitabatake AkiyoshiKitabatake Akiyoshi (ÂåóÁï†È°ïËÉΩ) (1326-1383) was a Kamakura Period military figure who defended the Southern Court during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period.

Storyline  Chaos has ensued in Professor Mariarti's five laboratories, as various items of equipment and other inanimate objects have come to life as a result of experiments having gone wrong, and are now a hindrance to the professor's work. Mariarti must shut down his laboratories in order to end the chaos, prove his sanity and avoid being put into a psychiatric hospital.  Gameplay  Screenshot shows a switch, some electric zappers and three conveyor belts on one of which is a steel wrench, which is one of the items that must be collected. The five laboratories are Biological Observations, Chemical Research Dept., Computer Laboratory, Spacerocket Development and Central Power Control. The first four laboratories may be visited in any order; Central Power Control becomes accessible once the other four have been closed down. The Amiga and Archimedes versions combines horizontal scrolling with vertical flip-screen. The Atari ST version uses flip-screen in both directions. In each laboratory, Mariarti must find and use a number of items in order to open up new areas and eventually to shut down the room. Examples of items and how they are used are: * Jam jars used as colour filters to read a secret door code * A diver's helmet enabling the Professor to enter a pressure chamber without being crushed to death * A bean that is to be planted in a pot to grow a beanstalk, which can then be climbed * A battery used to power a robot, which will then fetch another item that cannot otherwise be reached Screenshot shows two different enemy characters. The bottom panel shows, from left to right, the Professor's items, the currently selected item and score, his remaining lives, current weapon and health level. A number of enemy characters are seen in the game, mostly themed around the laboratory in which they are situated (e.g. walking floppy disks and joysticks in the Computer Laboratory, round-bottom flasks and molecular models in the Chemical Research Dept, and mutant plants and animals in Biological Observations). Initially, Mariarti's weapon is an infinite supply of spanners. Other weapons can bought from Tool Vendors using tokens that are scattered around the labs. There are also static obstacles that either drain the Professor's health gradually (such as puddles of acid) or kill him instantly if touched (such as electric zappers of various designs). Most of these cannot be controlled in any way, but some can be disabled via a switch situated somewhere in the laboratory. In each laboratory, Mariarti must eventually reach a second switch in order to close down the room. When a room is shut down, Mariarti is taken back to the lobby where he can choose another laboratory to visit next.

Today, BSL's mission is to \\"support fundamental research into all aspects of earthquakes, solid earth processes, and their effects on society\\". An experimental early warning system developed by BSL issued a warning 10 seconds before the 6.0 magnitude earthquake that hit the Napa region on August 24, 2014. Such a warning system could potentially give people time to take cover in the event of a quake, preventing injuries caused by falling debris, automatically stopping trains or shutting off gas lines. The system, developed in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington, will eventually cover the entire West Coast. The system would cost $80 million in funding to run for five years in California, or $120 million for the whole West Coast. In July 2015, USGS awarded $4 million in funding to the project partners to turn the current ShakeAlert prototype into a more robust system. See also * Andrew Lawson * Harry O.

The Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) had no methods in stopping the onslaught of tanks as they lacked anti-tank weapons and had no tanks at all. Battle On 28 June the ROKA demolished the bridge across the Han River trapping soldiers from the 5th Division and killing hundreds of refugees evacuating the city. North Korean forces were able to cross the river later that day and occupy Seoul.  Aftermath  On 30 June President of the United States Harry S. Truman released a statement that indicated the invasion of South Korea had grown the threat of Communism to the Pacific area and the United States. In response to the invasion, Truman ordered United States provide assistance with air and land forces in Korea. Moreover, Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Formosa and strengthened the United States forces in the Philippines. As a result of North Korea‚Äôs invasion, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 84. The Resolution authorised the use of the UN flag in operations against North Korean forces and those nations partaking.

He grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, where he received his early training as an artist. While studying in New York he was strongly influenced by Frederic Edwin Church of the Hudson River School. After spending four years in Europe he settled in New York in 1881, where he shared a studio with his brother Francis Coates Jones for the rest of his long life. He was celebrated for his realistic depictions of calm rural scenes of the eastern United States at different times of the year, usually empty of people. He won prizes in several major exhibitions in the US and France. His paintings are held in public collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution. Early years Hugh Bolton Jones was born to a respected family in Baltimore, Maryland on 20 October 1848. His parents were Hugh Burgess Jones and Laura Eliza Bolton. His mother was descended from a family that had come to Pennsylvania with William Penn and later moved to Baltimore. His father was an officer in a local insurance company. Hugh attended the Quaker School for his secondary education. He went on to study at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore under David Acheson Woodward, the portrait painter. Between 1865 and 1876 Jones spent a large part of his time in New York, while retaining Baltimore as his residence. In 1865 he took lessons in New York from the art designer Carey Smith (1837‚Äì1911). For a few months he studied under Horace Wolcott Robbins (1842‚Äì1904) before Robbins and Frederic Edwin Church (1826‚Äì1900) left for Jamaica. Church had a major influence on his style. Jones began to exhibit at the National Academy of Design in 1867. He became a close friend of the painter Thomas Hovenden (1840‚Äì1895) in New York. In 1868 Jones and Hovenden set up a shared studio in Baltimore. In the summer of 1870 Jones spent four months in Europe with his family. He exhibited scenes from England and Ireland at the 1871 Baltimore Artists Sale. He had joined the Allston Association of artists and collectors in Baltimore by 1872. He spent the summer of 1873 sketching in Maryland and Virginia, traveling by railway. His 1874 painting Summer in the Blue Ridge was exhibited at the National Academy of Design and was highly praised. In 1876 Jones and his younger brother Francis Coates Jones left for a four-year visit to travel and paint in Europe. They visited Edwin Austin Abbey in his home in London before moving to Pont-Aven, Brittany. H. Bolton Jones may have spent some time at the Acad√©mie Julian. He spent most of his time in the American artists' colony at Pont-Aven. There the brothers painted with Thomas Hovenden, Robert Wylie (1839‚Äì1877) and William Lamb Picknell (1853‚Äì1897). They lived cheaply at the Gloanec Pension, where Gauguin would stay in the late 1880s. He also sketched in Spain, England, Italy, and Morocco. He exhibited in London and in Paris at the Salon and the Exposition Universelle of 1878. Later career Gathering Leaves (1878) H. Bolton Jones returned to Baltimore in June 1880 and sold a set of his paintings in an auction. He then traveled in Spain and North Africa before returning to New York in 1881. In New York he shared a studio with his younger brother Francis. In 1881 Jones became a member of the Society of American Artists, and in 1883 he was elected an academician at the National Academy of Design. He joined the American Watercolor Society (1882), the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the National Arts Club. Jones was an enthusiastic woodcarver, and made his own frames. He also undertook most of the interior decoration of the showpiece studio that he eventually established at 33 West Sixty-Seventh Street in Manhattan. Jones painted in Annisquam, Massachusetts between 1883 and 1889 with William Lamb Picknell and others from the former artists' colony of Pont-Aven. In 1888 the Jones brothers moved to the Clinton Studio Building with their sister Louise Chubb, who was widowed. Jones traveled to the western US around 1890 to obtain material for Our Italy, a book about western America by Charles Dudley Warner that was published in 1891. He bought a summer cottage in South Egremont, Massachusetts. From this base he painted the Berkshires, and made expeditions to Maryland and West Virginia. He won medals in various major exhibitions between 1893 and 1915. In 1905 or 1906 the Jones brothers moved to the Atalier Building. H. Bolton Jones joined the Century Association and the Charcoal Club of Baltimore. His social life came to revolve around the Century Association. He was a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art from its foundation in 1914 until his death at age 78 from pernicious anemia on 24 September 1927 in New York City. Work Jones is best known for his paintings of the flat country of New England and New Jersey. The influence of Frederic Edwin Church and the Hudson River School shows in his handling of light and the precision of his en plein air depictions of nature. He painted the varying landscapes of each season of the year, in peaceful harmony. The Rahway River in Union County, New Jersey was one of his subjects according to Frank Townsend Lent in A Souvenir of Cranford New Jersey (1894). His subtle Barbizon-style studies drew praise, but his insistence on accuracy in his representation of nature was also criticized. His earlier paintings are lit by a clear, bright light, and sharply detailed, while his later works were more muted and lyrical. In his last decades, Jones' work became increasingly stale, repeating the same subjects and compositions in an outdated style. Thomas B. Clarke (1848‚Äì1931) said of him in 1891, Jones exhibited at the National Academy of Design between 1867 and 1927. He exhibited at the Paris Salons (1877‚Äì81), Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Annual (1879‚Äì85, 1891‚Äì1902, 1917‚Äì18), Boston Art Club (1881‚Äì1909). In 1884 Jones exhibited with the first exhibition of the Society of Painters in Pastels. He also exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, Society of American Artists (1902) and the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1907‚Äì12). He won prizes for his submissions at the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893), Exposition Universelle (Paris, 1889), Exposition Universelle (Paris, 1900), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis, 1904) and Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition (San Francisco, 1915). Jones' paintings are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution.

He was loyal to Despot Lazar during the succession conflict between Lazar and his brother Stefan Brankoviƒá on one side, and Grgur Brankoviƒá, Mara Brankoviƒá and Thomas Kantakouzenos on the other side. He also sided with Stefan Brankoviƒá, Helena Palaiologina and their pro-Hungarian party during the plots of pro-Ottoman renegade Mihailo Anƒëeloviƒá in March 1458 which led to Anƒëeloviƒá's downfall and imprisonment. His holdings, which had already expanded during the last years of Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, were further increased with lands all over the Despotate's territory during the reign of Despot Lazar and Despot Stefan as a reward for his loyalty to them and other services. However, they were all under the system of pronoia, in which a nobleman's ownership of his lands was conditional on providing military support to the state, as opposed to ba≈°tina, the other form of land ownership in medieval Serbia, which was full and unconditional. However, by 1459, Stefan Ratkoviƒá, increasingly pessimistic about the greatly reduced and war- devastated Serbia's chances of repelling the ongoing Ottoman invasion, had a change of heart. Stefan Ratkoviƒá assisted the plans of Helena Paleologina and King Stefan Toma≈°, had a leading role in organizing Toma≈°'s son's marriage with late Despot Lazar's daughter Maria and the illegal seizure of power from Despot Stefan Brankoviƒá that followed on 8 April 1459.

They take possession of it, name it Our Boat, and move aboard to use it as their houseboat. Buddy is smart, tough, streetwise, always confident, and the group's self-proclaimed leader; the shy, nervous, and not very bright Dancer is so nicknamed because he is too fidgety to sit still; Stuf is intellectual and sophisticated and a compulsive eater and gourmand who sees beauty in being overweight; Moose is large, muscled, and stupid, but gentle; and Boychick is a Clark Gable-like ladies man. Headquartered aboard Our Boat, they experience many slapstick, almost cartoonish adventures. Suzi Camelli, Julie, and Ralphie are friends of the Bums, Margie is a lifeguard, and Louise is the waitress at Tina Teena's Beach Caf√©. Production On May 13, 1977, ABC broadcast the pilot for The San Pedro Beach Bums, a 90-minute movie entitled The San Pedro Bums which told the story of the \\"Bums\\" finding Our Boat and moving aboard. Although a similar premise had not worked in the unsuccessful NBC comedy-drama It's a Man's World in 1962-1963, ABC believed enough in the concept that it picked up the show as a weekly one-hour situation comedy for its fall 1977 schedule. Concerned that the use of the word \\"bums\\" in the pilots title could be construed as negative and drive some viewers away unless softened by a more lighthearted connotation, ABC changed the name of the weekly series to The San Pedro Beach Bums. A cast change also took place, with Jeff Druce, who played Boychick in the pilot, replaced by Christopher De Rose in the weekly series. To boost viewership for The San Pedro Beach Bums, ABC scheduled it as the lead-in for the 1977 season of the popular ABC Monday Night Football. To garner extra attention for the shows premiere in September 1977, the women who starred as the \\"Angels\\" in the hit ABC program Charlie's Angels - Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith, and Cheryl Ladd - guest-starred as themselves in the episode. Aaron Spelling and Douglas S. Cramer were the shows executive producers. E. Duke Vincent wrote and produced the pilot, and Barry Shear directed it. Episode directors were Jack Arnold, Allen Baron, Earl Bellamy, Gene Nelson, George Tyne, and Don Weis. Episode writers included Earl Barret, William Raynor, and Myles Wilder. Broadcast history The San Pedro Beach Bums aired at 8:00 p.m. on Mondays throughout its run. ABC broadcast new episodes weekly from September 19 to October 31, 1977, followed by one more in November 1977 and two December 1977. Despite heavy promotion, highly favorable scheduling, and cross-marketing with more successful ABC shows, The San Pedro Beach Bums never gained much of an audience, and ABC cancelled the show after the broadcast of its 10th episode on December 19, 1977. An 11th episode did not air.

Described in 2010, the species is a workerless and obligate parasite of the related ant Mycocepurus goeldii. It is known only from Rio Claro, Brazil, and has only been found in nests of M. goeldii. M. castrator and its host are closely related and diverged recently, around 37,000 years ago. They evolved in the same geographic region, making the parasite‚Äìhost pair an example of sympatric speciation. The species is the first inquiline known among the lower attines. Etymology Because M. goeldii nests that host M. castrator appear to only produce sterile workers, the species has been named \\"castrator\\" in reference to that. Description M. castrator is a relatively minuscule species, with the average wing length being about 1.07‚Äì1.23 millimeters. The head is rectangular in shape, measuring about 0.6 millimeters across the face. The antennae consist of 11 segments. The species has stout, sharp, propodeal spines. The body, which ranges between light and dark reddish-brown, is thinly covered in setae. The body surface is shiny and patterned with tiny hexagonal structures. Unlike most species of Mycocepurus, males and females are physically similar. Distinguishing characteristics include the mandibles; the mandible terminates in a tooth in females, but does not do so in males. The first gastric tergite is only slightly concave in males, but markedly so in females. Finally, males' wings are medium to dark brown. The species is not believed to have a worker caste. Habitat and distribution M. castrator has only been observed in nests on the grounds of the S√£o Paulo State University in Rio Claro, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It has only been found in nests of M. goeldii, which is a widely distributed species, known from Brazil to northern Argentina. Like many other inquilines, M. castrator has small and isolated populations. Natural history Described in 2010, M. castrator is a social obligate parasite and the first inquiline known among the lower attines. The sex ratio for the species is skewed strongly toward females, with a ratio of about 11 to 1. The species is host-tolerant, with dealate queens of the species being found in the same nest chambers as queens of M. goeldii. However, it also inhibits its host's reproduction, preventing the production of fertile offspring. Behavior =Interaction with host species= M. goeldii workers will feed M. castrator queens in a process called trophallaxis. The two species will also engage in grooming each other, with dealate M. castrator queens frequently climbing on top of M. goeldii workers and queens. Host workers have also been observed to attack and kill parasite queens. Reproduction M. castrator is polygynous (nests consisting of multiple queens). The species mates inside the nest, as opposed to engaging in a nuptial flight like most ants. During mating, males and females copulate seemingly at random, with copulation lasting 18 to 27 seconds on average. Female alates begin to lose their wings three hours after mating, after which they congregate and engage in social grooming. Males begin to die twelve hours after mating. Relationship to Mycocepurus goeldii M. castrator is directly descended from M. goeldii, its host. Such relationships are not uncommon among social parasites, as recognized by Emery's rule. Less common are cases like M. castrator's, where two species diverge without the benefit of geographic isolation, known as sympatric speciation. Rabeling et al. (2014) analyzed divergence of mitochondrial versus nuclear DNA, finding that the nuclear alleles bore more similarities than the mitochondrial alleles. This led them to rule out the possibility of recent interbreeding, and conclude that sympatric speciation had occurred. The two species are believed to have diverged around 37,000 years ago, during the late Pleistocene.

Located directly on the Mississippi River approximately south of Fort Adams, Clarksville was one of the earliest non-Native settlements in Mississippi, and was considered a place of great promise. Clark Creek joined the Mississippi River at Clarksville, and the settlement was located on the south bank of the creek. Approximately south of Clarksville is the historically-significant 31st parallel north, which now forms the border between Mississippi and Louisiana, and approximately south of Clarksville is the current location of the Louisiana State Penitentiary. History In 1768, Daniel J. Clark, Sr., an Irish merchant and previous commander of a Pennsylvania regiment in the British Army, obtained grants for thousands of acres of land in what was then West Florida. One of the grants was near Natchez on St. Catherine's CreekClaiborne, J.F.H. (1880). Mississippi as a province, territory and state... Jackson: Power & Barksdale. p. 106. and another was for of riverfront land in what is now Wilkinson County. Clark settled there and established a slave-labor plantation. In 1797, Clarksville was the last base Andrew Ellicott used to survey the 31st latitude. There, Ellicott determined he was \\"three mile, and two hundred perches too far north\\" of the 31st parallel. Ellicott wrote that it would be: > impracticable to convey our instruments, baggage and stores directly from > Clarksville, to the most eligible place, owing to the extreme unevenness of > the country on the one hand, and the banks of the Mississippi not being > sufficiently inundated on the other, to give us passage by water through > swamps and small lakes. Ellicot also provided a detailed description of the land east of the Mississippi River at Clarksville: > The first twenty miles of country over which the line passed, is perhaps as > fertile as any in the United States; and at the same time the most > impenetrable, and could only be explored by using the cane knife and > hatchet. The whole face of the country being covered with strong canes, > which stood almost as close together as hemp stalks, and generally from > twenty to thirty five feet high, and matted together by various species of > vines, that connected them with the boughs of the lofty timber, which was > very abundant. The hills are numerous, short, and steep: from those untoward > circumstances, we were scarcely ever able to open one-fourth of a mile per > day, and frequently much less. Early settlers believed Clarksville had potential to be a significant settlement. In 1799, Clarkville was established as a port used by the government for revenue collection. That same year, William Dunbar, a friend of Clark's, wrote a letter to Winthrop Sargeant, the territorial governor, telling him that \\"Clarksville destined by nature, to become a considerable place at a future day, possesses advantages which give it a decided preference\\". Dunbar wrote that the settlement was \\"the first safe and commodious landing place north of the line of demarcation at 31 degrees\\", and that Clarksville was a \\"handsome plain ornamented by seven elegant Indian mounts\\" which will \\"become the site of a great commercial town\\". Clark Creek could be \\"converted into a grand Canal capable of conveying the largest commercial boats into and beyond the town\\", and that the creek formed a \\"harbour of perfect security\\" along the Mississippi River. As well, Clarksville could be protected by the soldiers stationed at Fort Adams. One objection to Dunbar's hopes for Clarksville described how \\"the country in the neighborhood of Clarksville is but thinly inhabited by persons, generally of small property; no person has as yet been induced to think the situation sufficiently advantageous, to establish a trading house at Clarksville\\".

He was also involved in the Burr conspiracy, and once wounded William C. C. Claiborne, the first territorial governor of Mississippi, in a duel. Clarksville appeared on a map of the Mississippi Territory in 1804, and continued to appear on some maps and was mentioned in records until the late 1800s. In the census of 1805, the population of Clarksville was two white males over 21, two whites males under 21, two white females, and 130 slaves. Two cemeteries were located near Clarksville. The Riverside Cemetery was a short distance west of Clarksville, and was used between 1835 and 1860. The cemetery is overgrown with vegetation, but the markers of several graves are still visible. The Clarksville Cemetery is located north of the settlement, and contains grave markers from as recent at 1988, indicating that the cemetery continued to be used long after Clarksville ceased to exist. Access to the former settlement is by Fort Adams Main Street, a dirt road which runs south from Fort Adams, then east along the north bank of Clark Creek. Several cottages and hunting lodges are located nearby, though nothing remains of Clarksville.

She also used the pseudonym Elke Klent. Life and career Elfriede Br√ºning was born in Berlin, the daughter of a cabinetmaker and a seamstress who were involved in the workers' movement.Carsten Wurm, \\"Br√ºning, Elfriede\\", Wer war wer in der DDR?, online edition, Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur Deutsche Presse- Agentur, \\"DDR- und Nachwende-Autorin: Schriftstellerin Elfriede Br√ºning ist tot\\", Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 5 August 2014 . Forced to leave school after the tenth year to help support the family, she worked in offices; beginning in 1929, she was a secretary at a Berlin film company. After forging a letter of recommendation,Oliver Das Gupta, \\"'Wir dachten, man m√ºsste das Volk zum Gl√ºck zwingen'\\", Interview, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 8 November 2010 . she began to publish articles in the Feuilleton sections of newspapers such as the Berliner Tageblatt, the Berliner B√∂rsen-Courier and the Vossische Zeitung. After attending a Marxist Workers' School, she joined the Communist Party (KPD) in 1930 and thereafter wrote mainly for the Communist press.Sabine Kebir, \\"Vom Alltag in der Etappe: Veteranin der Frauenemanzipation: Ein Nachruf auf die Schriftstellerin und Reporterin Elfriede Br√ºning\\", Junge Welt, 8 August 2014 . In 1932 she joined the Association of Proletarian- Revolutionary Authors; then the youngest in her branch, she was to be the last surviving member.Karlen Vesper, \\"Und au√üerdem ist Sommer ...

Her first novel, Handwerk hat goldenen Boden, was a social criticism and was to be published in 1933 but was not because of the Nazi seizure of power; it appeared in 1970 under the title Kleine Leute. Br√ºning turned to lighter reading and in 1934 published Und au√üerdem ist Sommer, which was a success. Br√ºning (left) in 1953 During the early years of the Nazi r√©gime, Br√ºning participated in the Communist resistance, writing for the exile newspaper Neue Deutsche Bl√§tter under the pseudonym Elke Klent and making trips to Prague, where it was published, as a courier for the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors. The KPD's illegal central committee met in the flat at her parents' shop. On 12 October 1935 she was arrested and imprisoned in the women's prison on Barnimstra√üe, but was released after her trial for treason in 1937, since the Gestapo was unable to prove she had engaged in illegal activities. She was able to obtain permission to write in prison, so in 1936 she published another novel, Junges Herz mu√ü wandern. In 1937 she married Joachim Barckhausen, a writer and editor;Sabine Kebir, \\"Blo√ü nicht aufh√∂ren\\", Interview, Der Freitag, 5 November 2009 . their daughter Christiane Barckhausen, born in 1942, also became a writer. Br√ºning worked as a script evaluator for a film company and with Barckhausen co-wrote the scenario for Semmelweis ‚Äì Retter der M√ºtter, which was filmed by DEFA after the war. She spent the last years of the war on her in-laws' estate in the Magdeburg B√∂rde. Br√ºning returned to Berlin in 1946, reactivated her KPD membership, and wrote for and edited news periodicals in what later became the German Democratic Republic. Her marriage ended in 1948. From 1950 on, she was self-employed as a writer and lived in Berlin. After German reunification she became a member of The Left. She continued to give interviews into her old age. She died in Berlin and was buried in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery.Nachrichten II , RBB, 25 August 2014, retrieved 26 August 2014 Her papers for the years 1930-2007 are in the Fritz H√ºser Institute in Dortmund.\\"Literarische Nachl√§sse, Vor- und Teilnachl√§sse und Sammlungen\\", Fritz-H√ºser-Institut f√ºr Literatur und Kultur der Arbeitswelt, City of Dortmund.

Her novels often have an autobiographical element; they usually concern women's lives and even the four she published under the Nazis have female protagonists who are determined to go against the party line by pursuing careers. They were popular in East Germany; by her 103rd birthday in 2013, a million and a half copies had been printed.\\"Mein Held h√§lt mich jung: Elfriede Br√ºning feiert Freitag mit ihrem Helfer Filip Wilhelm den 103. Geburtstag\\", B.Z., 7 November 2013 But especially in the 1950s, she was officially attacked as \\"petty bourgeois\\" for her themes of women seeking equality in marriage, and her work was insufficiently optimistic for official tastes. Although often nominated, she did not receive the most prestigious East German prizes, the Literature Prize of the Democratic Women's League of Germany and Art Prize of the Free German Trade Union Federation, until the 1980s, when she was in her seventies. After reunification she continued to write about social injustices, including those of the reunification. References Further reading * \\"Br√ºning, Elfriede\\". In: Inge Diersen, et al.

Course Big Run looking upstream above the falls Big Run begins in eastern Davidson Township. It flows east for a short distance, nearly reaching the border between Sullivan County and Luzerne County. It then turns north, entering a valley. Once inside the valley, the stream turns west and then southwest, as the valley gets deeper. After less than a mile, the stream turns northwest and leaves the valley. It then merges with Sullivan Branch to form East Branch Fishing Creek. =Tributaries= Big Run has two unnamed tributaries. These are known as Unt 28011 and Unt 28012. Both are considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by atmospheric deposition. Hydrology The average discharge of Big Run is 1404 gallons per minute. The average concentration of aluminum in the stream is 0.167 milligrams per liter. The pH of Big Run during average flow conditions is 5.61. Its pH ranges from less than 3 to nearly 7. The stream experiences episodic acidification. Big Run is considered to have \\"good\\" water quality during average flow conditions, but \\"severe\\" water quality during high flow conditions.

Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art. . In antiquity, the area was named Pharsalos, and became known for the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BCE, where Julius Caesar defeated Pompey during the Great Roman Civil War.Fields, Nic (2010). Julius Caesar: Leadership, Strategy, Conflict. Osprey Publishing. pp. 23‚Äì26. . . Heuzey and the architect Henri Daumet were involved in an official mission to collect objects related to Caesar's campaigns; they also were interested in other artifacts unrelated to their work. In 1863, they found this marble bas- relief embedded in the walls of a church in the neighborhood of Paleo-Loutro in Farsala and named it The Exaltation of the Flower. Heuzey was informed that the stone was originally discovered in a garden, close to another stone that was not recovered. Heuzey purchased the stone and had it sent to the Louvre in Paris.Heuzey, L.; H. Daumet (1876). Mission arch√©ologique de Mac√©doine. Volume 1. Paris. pp. 415‚Äì417. .

Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others.Louvre Ma 701 (Sculpture). Perseus Project. Tufts University. . British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate.

Atlas: the database of the exhibited works of art (in French). Mus√©e du Louvre. Retrieved March 25, 2015. . Analysis In his 1868 paper, Heuzey argued that the images in the stele suggested the goddesses Persephone (Kore) and Demeter, referring to the cult of Kore and the legend of Demeter found in the Homeric Hymns. French archaeologist and art historian Maxime Collignon explained, \\"Heuzey believes that this monument refers to the cultus of Core, daughter of Demeter, a divinity suggesting in Greek legend the ephemeral but incessantly recurring bloom of nature.\\" French archaeologist Olivier Rayet (1847‚Äì1887) disagreed with the interpretation Heuzy offered. While Heuzey's perspective still has adherents, it has largely fallen out of favor among art historians. According to the Perseus Project at Tufts University, \\"It is now generally agreed ... that the figures represented are mortals rather than goddesses.\\" Heuzey c. 1883 German archaeologist Heinrich Brunn believed the decorative qualities of the Pharsalos stele originated in Asia Minor. Following this line of reasoning, Scottish archaeologist Alexander Stuart Murray compared the facial features of the stele, such as the eyes, lips, and nose, to similar facial features found in the Harpy Tomb relief from Xanthos in Lycia.Murray, Alexander Stuart (1880).

German classical archaeologist Roland Hampe (1908‚Äì1981) disagreed with Picard's hypothesis, saying that the size of the stele should demonstrate that both women were standing, not sitting. Flowers, fungi, or bones It is generally agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895‚Äì1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy.Picard, Charles. (1953). Die Stele aus Pharsalos im Louvre by Roland Hampe. Gnomon, 25 (2): 82‚Äì85. . Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837‚Äì1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep used to play the game of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.De Ruyt, Franz. (1952). Roland Hampe, Die Stele aus Pharsalos im Louvre. L'antiquit√© classique, 21 (2): 544. . In 1911, Greek scholar and archaeologist Rufus B. Richardson, formerly of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, observed that what was being described as flowers in the relief, looked similar to mushrooms.Richardson, Rufus Byam (1911). A History of Greek Sculpture. American Book Company. pp. 73, 96. . English classicist Robert Graves and Italian ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini both have referred to the fragment as evidence for the entheogen hypothesis, speculating that the significant items depicted in the work are a type of psychoactive mushroom that was used in the Eleusinian Mysteries.Samorini, Giorgio (1998). The Pharsalus Bas-Relief and the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Entheogen Review, 7(2): 60‚Äì63. .Samorini, Giorgio; Gilberto Camilla (1995). Rappresentazioni fungine nell‚Äôarte greca. Annali del Museo Civico di Rovereto, 10: 307‚Äì326. (html). . Graves even featured the image as the cover of one edition of The Greek Myths, noting that although it might be depicted in artwork, it would remain unnamed in texts because of its sacredness. American classicist Carl A. P. Ruck has made similar arguments. Although the entheogen hypothesis is controversial and generally rejected by mainstream scholarship,Samorini (1998) writes: \\"This bas-relief takes us to the very heart of the 'Eleusinian question,' its mysteries, and the controversial issue of the Eleusinian entheogen‚Äôs psychopharmacology. Researchers have recently cast doubts on and rejected the hypothesis put forward by Wasson, Hofmann & Ruck in 1978 that presents ergot and its visionary alkaloids as the psycho-pharmacological key to the Eleusinian Mysteries...\\" in a review of Hampe's Die Stele aus Pharsalos im Louvre (1951), Picard notes that \\"one may be increasingly reminded that Pharsalos was indeed an Eleusinian center\\".

It was announced on 28 September 1927 with a six-cylinder engine and a four-speed gearbox. A cautious move downmarket. \\"The first time any six-cylinder Vauxhall has been sold under ¬£1000!\\" \\"British & Vauxhall\\". The initial 2.7-litre engine was enlarged to 3-litres after twelve months. Priced to be at the lower end of the luxury market with six cylinders, four speeds and five brakes, the better endowed 20-60 replaced the 4-cylinder Vauxhall 14-40. Though the new engine's capacity or swept volume was enlarged just 465cc the vagaries of the RAC or tax formula moved its tax rating from 14HP to 20HP. This tax increase was a significant impost for owners. Its design was completed before General Motors took control in late 1925 making the car \\"in construction and plan British\\". The 20-60 ‚Äì it was given a 3.3-litre engine in October 1930 and renamed 80, later Silent Eighty ‚Äì remained in production until the introduction of Vauxhall's first true General Motors large-car design, the Vauxhall Big Six, announced and displayed in October 1933 but not delivered until August 1934 long after the GM-designed medium-sized Cadet released in October 1930. This gap in Vauxhall's programme may reflect the sales-failure of their very expensive 25-70 sleeve-valve car. General Motors had taken control of Vauxhall 16 November 1925. Design and specifications =Engine= The iron engine block is cast in one unit with the crankcase. It has been given a crankshaft with nine bearings which makes the strongest contribution to the engine's smooth running, even at high speed. The overhead valves have been given double springs and the cup-and-ball joints on the rockers are fed with oil forced up to the rocker shaft. The cast-iron cylinder head may be removed without disturbing valve settings. The valve mechanism has an easily removable light aluminium cover. The crankcase has a breather on the oil filling cap. Drive to the three-bearing camshaft and the built in generator is provided by chain. Spark timing is controlled automatically. The distributor is positioned at the back of the engine. Inlet and exhaust manifolds are on the right hand side of the block. the inlet manifold's two branch mixing chamber has a vee-shaped piece inside which is heated by exhaust gases. An air-cleaner is provided. Petrol is supplied from a 14-gallon tank at the rear of the car through an Autovac tank on the dashboard. Further engine details are provided in the panel to the right. Engine clutch and gearbox are assembled as one unit and mounted at three points. Designer Charles Evelyn King. =Transmission= The single plate dry clutch has a central external spring and roller spigot bearing. The gears are changed by a central lever working in an invisible gate. There is a brake lever just to the left of the gear lever operating a band transmission brake mounted directly behind the gearbox. The band may be adjusted by a threaded rod. Drive is taken by an open propellor shaft coupled by triple Hardy disc joints to the half-floating spiral-bevel driven rear axle which has a banjo case. =Chassis= The suspension is by half-elliptical springs in front and behind, those at the back being underhung. The front springs are flat-set, held out-of-centre and shackled forward. Dampers are fitted front and back. The four-wheel brakes are cable operated. Steering is by Marles cam and roller. R-type saloon R-type Melton open 2-seater 1928 with dickey seat R-type Cabriolet 1928 Road test The motoring correspondent of The Times reported that he liked the car though he thought the suspension could be improved, the springs at the back were too harsh with just two persons in the car. Otherwise he considered the car pleasing, the engine well balanced and it made no noise, the controls were light and simple and functioned correctly. He considered the four wheel brakes to be some of the best he had experienced, particularly as they are without servo- assistance. The saloon body, he said, seats five in comfort having two adjustable seats in front, four doors and four winding windows. The instruments have concealed lighting and are neatly grouped on the dash. The battery is kept under the front floor boards in front of the passenger's seat and tools are in a box on the running board. There is a good sized luggage grid at the back. The spare wheel and its tyre are mounted forward of the driver's door. Improvements for 1929 The engine bore has been increased from 73mm to 75mm adding 465cc to the swept area and it is now a 2.9 litre engine. The combustion head, intake manifold, camshaft and silencer are redesigned. Pistons are now aluminium and the crankshaft bearings have been enlarged to meet the greater power output. The steering has been modified. Vauxhall now produced just the one model. The luxurious 25-70 sleeve-valve six and the 30-98 had been dropped from production. The car has been given a taller narrower radiator (2 inches higher), the top of the radiator and the top of the scuttle are now almost level, and a more slender body with wider front wings. Larger nickel finished headlamps are mounted high on a nickel finish bar. There is a 25% increase in the engine's power output; improved acceleration and flexibility; improved brakes; a stronger chassis and better springs { Grosvenor Carriage Co 1929 thumb } =Controls= The position of the handbrake and change-speed levers has been changed. A new shape of handbrake lever is now on the right side of the driver but allows entry through that doorway. The change-speed lever is now in the centre of the car and is of the flexible type working in an invisible gate. It has very short travel allowing three passengers in front.

The new larger engine detailed below had several refinements. =Modified engine with increased power= The T-80 enlarged six-cylinder was now rated 23.8 hp for tax purposes. Bore had been increased by 5mm to 80mm and capacity was now 3,317 cc. Power was increased by 15 per cent and it was now 62 bhp at 3,000 rpm. Valves had been increased in diameter and the mechanism lightened. The camshaft was now driven by triple roller chain from the crankshaft. The dynamo had been switched to the left hand side and was now driven by an additional v-belt from the fan pulley. The four-point rubber suspension of the engine had been improved and to meet the higher compression the starter had been made stronger. The full transmission line had also been strengthened. Small modifications have been made to the brakes. =Catalogue October 1930= * Richmond saloon ¬£495 formerly ¬£540, sliding roof ¬£10 extra * Kingston Sportsman's Coup√© ¬£535 formerly ¬£595 * Grafton Coup√© ¬£575 formerly ¬£660 * Grosvenor 7-seater limousine ¬£650 formerly ¬£695 ‚Äì formerly known as the Westminster : A Velox fabric saloon ¬£495 was added to the catalogue in early 1931 : Then a Westminster 7-seater Limousine ¬£695 returned in addition to the Grosvenor =Road test= \\"The engine was exceptionally pleasing, quiet, well balanced at all speeds, flexible with fine acceleration . . . the lower gears might be quieter . . .\\" ‚Äì reported The Times's motoring correspondent ‚Äì \\"the four-wheel brakes were above reproach . . .

Carpenter, who specialized in the Reconstruction Period following the American Civil War, published biographies of Oliver Otis Howard and Ulysses S. Grant. Early life and education Carpenter was born to Charles Francis Carpenter and Marion Jewett Carpenter in Boonton, New Jersey on August 1, 1921. His father's active interest in the Civil War piqued his own childhood interest and later career focus. After attending St. John's School (now Wilson School) in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey,Carpenter graduated from Morristown School in Morristown, New Jersey in 1938. He completed his bachelor's degree at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1942. Carpenter attended Harvard through a scholarship from the Harvard Club of New Jersey. During his studies at the university, Carpenter played on the rowing team, and he participated in the glee club. He also first connected with Howard while writing a paper on his career in the U.S. Army for a course. After serving for three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Carpenter completed a master's degree at Columbia University in 1947. His master's thesis examined industrial development in Paterson, New Jersey between 1792 and 1913. In 1954, Carpenter earned a Ph.D. from Columbia after he studied Howard for his dissertation. His dissertation had the title: An Account of the Civil War Career of Oliver Otis Howard Based on His Private Letters. Faculty career In 1957, Carpenter joined the faculty of Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania as an assistant professor of history and political science. He received a promotion to associate professor in 1960. Carpenter taught at the school until 1965 when he joined the faculty of the Department of History at Fordham University in the Bronx. He served in that role through 1978 and held the position of chair of the department. During his faculty career, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded Carpenter grants to fund his research on the Freedmen's Bureau. The American Philosophical Society also funded his research. In 1974, Carpenter contributed his expertise to the 54-part series \\"The American Presidency: The Men and the Office\\" on CBS-TV. The 1976 book Power and the Presidency discusses the scholarship presented in the series. Public speaking Carpenter earned notoriety among the historian community for his guest lectures. He frequently spoke to civic groups, historical societies, and service groups. In 1967, Carpenter spoke about \\"Stephen A. Douglas and the Election of 1860\\" at the convocation program at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut. Legacy The John A. Carpenter Research Material Collection at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library in New York City houses Carpenter's papers. The collection includes manuscripts, typescripts, research notes, reviews of Carpenter's books, his articles and lectures, and other materials. It also contains his materials for a project biographing all agents of the Freeman's Bureau. Books *1964 Sword and Olive Branch: Oliver Otis Howard *1970 Ulysses S.

The field has been home to many professional teams in the past, and is now used as part of developmental baseball leagues. Some notable teams to call Marsh Field home include the Muskegon Clippers, a now defunct farm team of the New York Yankees, the Muskegon Belles, an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League team for the 1953 season, the Muskegon Lassies, an AAGPBL team that played at Marsh Field from 1946‚Äì1950, and the Outwin Zephyrs, a Negro league baseball team. Currently, Marsh Field is used by the Muskegon Clippers (no relation to the previous farm team), a wooden bat college level team, the Muskegon City League, the Muskegon Big Reds baseball team, and is used as part of the Extra Innings Muskegon Fall Baseball league. Frank Barnes, a major league catcher, played two seasons of minor league baseball at Marsh Field. He later played in Major League Baseball for the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals. He and Elston Howard were the first ever African-American players signed by the Yankees. Howard played one season at Marsh Field.

It was released on Microsoft Windows and OS X on September 29, 2015. It employs branching narrative storytelling, allowing the player to make choices that impact the plot. Plot and gameplay In 80 Days, players have to make choices that impact the direction the story takes. The plot is loosely based on Jules Verne's 1873 novel Around the World in Eighty Days. The year is 1872 and Monsieur Phileas Fogg has placed a wager at the Reform Club that he can circumnavigate the world in eighty days or less. The game follows the course of this adventure, as narrated by Phileas Fogg's manservant Passepartout, whose actions and decisions are controlled by the player. After leaving London on an underwater train to Paris or a mail carriage to Cambridge, the player can choose their own route around the world, travelling from city to city. Each city and journey contains unique narrative content. The developers estimate that on one complete circumnavigation of the globe players will see approximately 2% of the game's 750,000 words of textual content. In their role as valet, players must manage finances, their master's health, and time as well as buying and selling items in different markets around the globe. The choices made by the player in story sections can also have a large impact on how the journey proceeds. The game has several secrets, Easter Eggs and hidden endings, as well as several references to Verne's works, including Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and From the Earth to the Moon. The game is also partly inspired by the steampunk genre, featuring such elements as sapient mechanical transport, hovercraft, submersibles and an entire city that walks on four gigantic legs. Reception The game has a rating of 88/100 and 84/100 for iOS and PC respectively on Metacritic. Phil Cameron of The Daily Telegraph described it as \\"one of the finest examples of branching narrative yet created\\". AppleNApps said \\"The story is absolutely superb with the little twists, and nuances on the classic to keep you constantly engaged to press onwards.\\" PocketGamer said \\"It's rich with ideas, brilliantly written, and creates a world that you'll want to visit over and over again.\\" Gamezebo wrote \\"80 Days has a solid amount of depth to it, [and] a great story...It's a challenge ‚Äì but an intelligent one.\\" GrabItMagazine said \\"the studio inkle deserves high praise for creating an accessible and, ultimately, fun way for people to experience Verne's classic work.\\" It was named as Times 2014 Game of the Year. Despite being a game, The Telegraph newspaper also named it as \\"one of the best novels of 2014\\". The lead writer, Meg Jayanth, won a UK Writer's Guild award for her work on the project. The game received four BAFTA nominations in 2015, for Best British Game, Best Story, Best Mobile Game and Game Innovation, as well as three IGF nominations for 2014, for Excellence in Design, Excellence in Narrative and in the Grand Prize category.

Both are used to describe the understanding that what exists is not nothing without needing to address the existence of everything. The philosopher, David Lewis, has pointed out that these are necessarily vague terms, asserting that \\"ontological assertions of common sense are correct if the quantifiers‚Äîsuch words as \\"something\\" and \\"anything\\"‚Äîare restricted roughly to ordinary or familiar things.\\"Eli Hirsch, Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology (2011), p. 106. The idea that \\"something\\" is the opposite of \\"nothing\\" has existed at least since it was proposed by the Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry in the 3rd century.Iamblichus, Fragments of Iamblichus' Commentary on the Timaeus, John Myles Dillon trans. (1973), p. 211. One of the most basic questions of both science and philosophy is: why is there something rather than nothing at all?See, e.g., Tyron Goldschmidt, ed., The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? (2014). A question that follows from this is whether it is ever actually possible for there to be nothing at all, or whether there must always be something.See, e.g., D. M. Armstrong, Truth and Truthmakers (2004), p. 89. Grammatically, \\"something and anything are commonly classified as pronouns, although they do not stand for another noun so clearly as does thing itself, a word always classified as a noun\\".Robert Eustis Morsberger, Janet Rankin Aiken, Commonsense Grammar and Style (1975), p. 54. In predicate logic In predicate logic, what is described in layman's terms as \\"something\\" can more specifically be regarded as existential quantification, that is, the predication of a property or relation to at least one member of the domain. It is a type of quantifier, a logical constant which is interpreted as \\"there exists,\\" \\"there is at least one,\\" or \\"for some.\\" It expresses that a propositional function can be satisfied by at least one member of a domain of discourse. In other terms, it is the predication of a property or relation to at least one member of the domain. It asserts that a predicate within the scope of an existential quantifier is true of at least one value of a predicate variable. Nothing and something Though considered to exclude one another, the concepts of something and nothing can coincide under special circumstances. One example would be when a person says \\"I am doing nothing\\"; they are really doing something, because it is physically and mentally impossible to do nothing. At the specific level, nothing can be used as a label describing something. The requirement is that the nothing equates to not changing the outcome. For instance, when hiking up and down a mountain, the trip can be expressed in increments of height. Climbing the mountain, the increments can be described as pluses (as in positive increases) and when descending the increments are described as minuses (negative increases). Yet walking around at the top of a mountain, one does not ascend or descend, and the increments are neither positive nor negative. Nothing in height was added or subtracted when reviewing these specific moments during the mountain climb. This reality of nothing can only occur as a subset of somethings. In the example above, the somethings can be seen as the mountain and the person climbing the mountain. Next, the nothing can be recognized as a something, but again only as part of the subset of the exercise, since walking around can be referred to as doing something while the exercise adds nor subtracts anything in height. To set nothing correctly apart from something, one must declare the specific level at which the something and the nothing are articulated. Both are therefore not only declared by their own definition but need to be declared within a larger reality as well. Without declaring the overall setting ‚Äî and this brings us to the overall level that G√∂del already explored ‚Äî it becomes difficult to declare whether we're talking about a tree or about a forest, particularly where nothing is concerned. Anything Often pronounced in a way that indicates evading specifics, anything provides full freedom about the something that is supposedly covered by the word. \\"Anything goes\\" indicates maximization of freedom, just like \\"Do as you please\\" means there are no restrictions other than the restrictions put in place by oneself. One can make the statement that anything is a specific word where everything can be seen as a general word. Still, both meanings may readily be understood by everyone, while their definitions will equally contain some aspects of murkiness as to what is included and what is not. First of all, anything does not need to be covered by an actual something, since an act of god or fate, a coincident or an unintended consequence can also be included in the list of anything. Also, the question whether an actual nothing can also be used to take up the place of anything is harder to debate at the abstract level and requires actual input to declare whether this is true or false. Examples of this position are that not the amount of money, but rather the lack of money can make us rise and shine early from bed to go to work, and that not the abundance of food, but rather hunger and the lack of food make us hunt and till the soil. See also: Much Ado About Nothing. Singular and plural somethings Since words are abstracts and are actualized only through the action of understanding, an interesting distinction exists between singular somethings and plural somethings. When describing a single object or describing more than one object in an action of, for instance, breaking something, the verb is conjugated differently. In \\"The glass was broken\\" and \\"The glasses were broken,\\" the verb to be is conjugated differently according to the singular or plural reality described. However, when using a singular word describing multiple items, the verb is (correctly) conjugated as if this were a singular entity: \\"The collection was destroyed\\" and not \\"The collection were destroyed.\\" The example shows that plural somethings can be presented as singular somethings. Actual somethings can therefore as shown above be hidden under the banner of an abstract something. Some claim to have evidence that a singular something does not occur in actuality at the overall level ever, and that a singular overall truth can only exist correctly at the abstract level in our minds. As such, the concept of something would then also have a direct correlation to the concept of everything just as this exists for the concept of nothing. References Further reading * Bertrand Russell.

In late November, Wurmser pulled back from his defenses behind the Zorn River and assumed a new position along the Moder River at Haguenau. After continuous fighting, Wurmser finally withdrew to the Lauter River after his western flank was turned in the Battle of Froeschwiller on 22 December. Haguenau is a city in Bas-Rhin department of France, located north of Strasbourg. Consisting of troops from Habsburg Austria, Hesse-Kassel and Electoral Bavaria, plus French Royalists, the Coalition army broke through the French frontier defenses in the First Battle of Wissembourg on 13 October 1793 and overran Alsace as far as the Zorn River. The French government reacted to the emergency by appointing Pichegru to lead the Army of the Rhine and urging it to attack. Beginning on 18 November, Pichegru ordered continual attacks on the Coalition lines which slowly forced Wurmser's army back. The Battle of Berstheim was a notable action during the French offensive. Unfortunately for Wurmser, a Prussian army failed to pin down Lazare Hoche's Army of the Moselle to the west. When Hoche began to put pressure on the Coalition right wing, Wurmser was unable to spare sufficient troops to resist the new threat because of Pichegru's relentless frontal attacks. The next combat was the Second Battle of Wissembourg on 25-26 December. Background In the First Battle of Wissembourg on 13 October 1793, the Coalition army under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser assaulted and defeated the French Army of the Rhine led by Jean Pascal Carlenc. The Coalition mustered 33,599 infantry and 9,635 cavalry while the French counted 45,312 foot soldiers and 6,278 horsemen. The mostly Austrian army with allied Hessians, Swabians and French √âmigr√©s suffered 1,800 casualties while inflicting losses of 2,000 killed and wounded on the French. In addition the Coalition captured 1,000 soldiers, 31 guns and 12 colors. Another source gave a total of 43,185 Coalition troops and 34,400 French. A number of French officers behaved poorly. Right Wing commander Paul-Alexis Dubois retreated unnecessarily while Carlenc refused to order a counterattack without authorization from French political officials. The French army fell back south toward Strasbourg. Jean-Charles Pichegru On 23 October 1793, the chilling Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and his colleague Philippe-Fran√ßois- Joseph Le Bas arrived as representatives on mission with extraordinary powers. They immediately sent for Jean-Charles Pichegru, who commanded troops on the upper Rhine River, to lead the army. They stopped the practice of officers and men visiting Strasbourg and insisted on strict discipline. They also purged the army staff of noblemen and instituted a harsh regime of shooting and sacking officers. Meanwhile, a gang of revolutionaries dragged a guillotine from village to village visiting retribution on supposed enemies. The gang's activities became so extreme that even Saint-Just had to call for a stop.Phipps (2011), pp. 76-77 On 29 October 1793, Pichegru arrived at Strasbourg to assume command of the Army of the Rhine.Phipps (2011), p. 81 Carlenc was dismissed and arrested, though he avoided the guillotine.Phipps (2011), p. 74 On 30th the army's organization included the Advanced Guard under Jean Baptiste Meynier, Right Wing under Dubois, Left Wing under Claude Ferey and Center under Louis Dominique Munnier. Jean Fran√ßois Ravel de Puycontal led the artillery and pioneers. In the following order of battle, the numbered regular army infantry units are in demi brigades and the battalions named after their departments are National Guard units. The nominal total was 57,369 men while the number of soldiers fit for duty was 42,420. Louis Saint-Just Ravel's command comprised the 5th Artillery Regiment, the 1st Battalion of the Bas-Rhin, one battalion of Pioneers and 22 Guides. The Advanced Guard consisted of the 6th, 12th, 48th and 105th Line Infantry, 1st and 2nd Grenadier Battalions, the Chasseurs du Rhin, the 1st Battalions of the Corr√®ze and Jura and the 2nd Battalion of the Lot-et-Garonne. Jean Claude Loubat de Bohan commanded a cavalry brigade that comprised the 8th, 11th and 17th Dragoon, 7th Hussar, and 8th and 10th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. The Right Wing included the 37th and 40th Line and 11th Light Infantry, the 1st Battalion of the Pyren√©es-Orientales, the 3rd Battalions of the Charente- Inf√©rieur, Haute-Sa√¥ne and Rh√¥ne-et-Loire, the 5th Battalion of the Ain, the 7th Battalion of the Haute-Sa√¥ne and a free company. Dagobert von Wurmser The Left Wing counted the 13th and 27th Line and 7th Light Infantry, the 1st Battalions of the Haute-Rhin, Haute-Sa√¥ne, Indre and Vosges, the 2nd Battalion of the Rh√¥ne-et-Loire, the 3rd Battalions of the Indre-et-Loire and Haut-Rhin, the 4th Battalions of the Jura and Seine-et-Loire and the 10th Battalion of the Vosges, the 7th Chasseurs √† Cheval and one squadron each of the Gendarmes and 2nd Cavalry Regiments. In the Center, Jean Nicolas Mequillet's brigade consisted of the 3rd and 30th Line Infantry, the 1st Battalion of the Ain, the 3rd Battalions of the Ain and Doubs and the 12th Battalion of the Jura. Augustin-Joseph Isambert's brigade was made up of the 46th Line Infantry, the 2nd Battalions of the Eure-et-Loire and Puy-de-D√¥me, the 3rd Battalion of the Bas-Rhin and the 11th Battalion of the Doubs. Paul Louis Darigot de la Ferri√®re's brigade had two battalions of the 93rd Line Infantry, the 1st Battalion of the Lot-et-Garonne, the 2nd Grenadier Battalion of the Rh√¥ne-et- Loire and the 5th Battalion of the Seine-et-Oise. Saint-Just declared that \\"for the good of the army\\" a general needed to be executed as an example. Because he had retreated before a small body of Austrian horsemen, Isambert was chosen as the example. The 60-year-old Isambert died on 9 November. Isambert was one of 17 generals executed in 1793; in the following year the number would almost quadruple.Rothenberg (1980), p. 36 Dubois was replaced in command of the Right Wing. Louis Desaix was appointed to lead the Advance Guard on the far right while Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino took over the Left Wing from Ferey who reassumed command of his brigade. The senior division commander Munnier was temporarily put in charge of the army but when it looked like the appointment might be permanent, he simply stopped communicating any orders. He was of course arrested and sent to Paris, but he managed to escape execution.Phipps (2011), p. 70 After Wissembourg, the Left Wing retreated to the Zorn River at Hochfelden. On 14 October, a 4,700-man Coalition force led by Austrian Franz von Lauer undertook the Siege of Fort-Louis. The 4,500-man garrison under Michel Durand manned the fort's 111 artillery pieces. The defenders included three regular and four National Guard battalions. The attacking force counted three Electoral Bavarian battalions, two Hesse- Darmstadt battalions, one battalion and two Hussar squadrons of Austrians and 55 siege cannons. The fort surrendered on 14 November and the French became prisoners of war.Smith (1998), p. 61 On 22 October 1793 Austrian Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze's troops attacked Ferino's positions at Saverne. With the help of six battalions of reinforcements from the Army of the Moselle, Ferino drove off the Coalition force. It is probable that Nicolas Oudinot won a promotion to chef de brigade (colonel) on this occasion.Phipps (2011), p. 85 On the 27th, the Austrians attacked Desaix's division but the capable general fought his division well and held his ground. Battle Map shows Haguenau and the Moder and Zorn Rivers in Alsace. Starting on 18 November, Pichegru began a series of attacks on the Coalition lines. Wurmser was Alsatian and fiercely resisted being driven out of his homeland. By this time the French division commanders were Desaix on the right, Claude Ignace Fran√ßois Michaud on the right-center, Ferino on the left-center and Pierre Augustin Fran√ßois de Burcy on the left. Michaud assaulted the woods near Brumath but his and Desaix's divisions were turned back. On the left, Burcy and Ferino's divisions drove back Hotze and threatened Bouxwiller. Knowing that the allied Prussian army of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel was withdrawing into winter quarters on his right flank, Wurmser ordered a retreat to positions closer to the Moder River and Haguenau.Phipps (2011), p. 91 Pierre Ferino Burcy followed up the Coalition withdrawal to Gundershoffen, where, on 26 November, the representatives ordered Burcy to attack a strong Coalition redoubt. When Burcy hesitated, the politicians threatened to arrest him. He attacked with one brigade, was repulsed, attacked again with the last intact unit and was killed while leading his troops. The soldiers retreated to Uttenhoffen, leaving a second brigade isolated in the Mietesheim forest. Forgotten for two days amid the battle, this brigade was attacked on 28 November and held its position largely thanks to the leadership of Oudinot. Burcy's replacement was his chief of staff Jacques Maurice Hatry who ordered the brigade to pull back into line that afternoon. Hatry attacked the Gundershoffen redoubt again on 1 December and was repulsed.Phipps (2011), p. 92 Ferino's division fought its way across the Zorn to the village of Mommenheim. Here the French were opposed by Siegfried von Kospoth's Austrians on their right and the French Royalist Army of Cond√© on their left. After Ferino's left brigade under Ferey was repulsed by the Royalists and lost some cannons, Jean Ignace Pierre was appointed to lead the unit. Ferino directed Pierre to clear the village of Berstheim which the √©migr√©s had fortified. On 27 and 28 November Pierre proved unable to carry out this assignment so Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr offered to capture and hold the village. On 2 December Saint-Cyr rapidly seized the village with two battalions under the noses of the astounded Royalists. However, Pierre in his haste advanced his troops in poor order and the √©migr√©s took cruel advantage of his mistake. The Royalist cannons suddenly opened up on the Republicans, causing confusion. Part of the Royalist cavalry routed Pierre's brigade, capturing its artillery, while another part charged Ferino's cavalry.Phipps (2011), p. 93 At length, the French cavalry recovered a few of the lost guns, but Saint-Cyr was compelled to withdraw from Berstheim. The combat ended when some Austrian troops arrived to help. Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon was wounded in the hand.Phipps (2011), p. 94 Pichegru ordered Saint-Cyr, a mere lieutenant colonel, to take command of Pierre's brigade on 6 December. After his brigade was reinforced, Saint-Cyr moved on Berstheim on the 8th. The Royalists taunted the Republicans, asking if they were bringing them more artillery to capture. Saint-Cyr advanced his light troops to the edge of the village before pulling back. The √©migr√© infantry under General Gelb and cavalry led by Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien rushed in pursuit. On this day the Royalists were mauled and Gelb was killed while Enghien's coat was riddled with bullet holes. The Duke of Bourbon narrowly escaped death. When he cut his way into the 19th Line Infantry,Phipps (2011), p. 95 a Republican officer recognized him and saluted with his sword rather than running him through.Phipps (2011), p. 96 On 9 December, Saint-Cyr advanced on Berstheim again and was surprised to find that the Royalists had retired. This move was part of Wurmser's deliberate withdrawal to the Moder. Village of Berstheim Jacques Hatry Once established in his Moder defenses, Wurmser repelled assault after assault by Pichegru. The French commander reinforced Desaix on the right in an effort to seize Bischwiller. Michaud hammered at the Coalition forts north of Brumath while Ferino attacked southwest of Haguenau. Off to the west, Hatry's division repeatedly tried to cross the Zinzel River at Mertzwiller but was driven back each time. Despite being able to hold off the frontal attacks of the Army of the Rhine, Wurmser became anxious about his western flank. In the Battle of Kaiserslautern on 28 to 30 November 1793, the Duke of Brunswick repulsed the Army of the Moselle under Lazare Hoche.Smith (1998), pp. 62-63 Thwarted there, Hoche began shifting his army to the right. Already on 23 November Philippe- Joseph Jacob's division reached Niederbronn-les-Bains on the edge of the Vosges, behind Wurmser's right flank. Hoche feinted at Kaiserslautern again but in actuality, he ordered his left wing to fortify Pirmasens and Blieskastel while throwing his weight to the east. On 5 December, a second division arrived near Niederbronn and its commander Alexandre Camille Taponier assumed control of both divisions.Phipps (2011), p. 97 Taponier's 12,000 troops began fighting their way down the Niederbronn valley on 8 December. On 12 December, Jean Grangeret's 10,000-man division joined the other Army of Moselle troops. Pichegru and Hoche met at Niederbronn on the 14th to arrange for their two armies to act together. A series a battles ensued in which Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre took command of Jacob's division and Jean-de-Dieu Soult led an independent detachment. The Battle of Froeschwiller ended on 22 December when the Army of the Moselle captured Froeschwiller, Woerth and Reichshoffen. This event prompted Wurmser to abandon Haguenau and begin retreating to the Lines of Wissembourg on the Lauter River, closely pursued by the Army of the Rhine.Phipps (2011), pp. 98-99 Results Fran√ßois Bourcier By continually attacking while shrugging off frequent repulses, the French wore out their enemies rather than defeating them. Pichegru was able to use the dangerous Saint-Just and La Bas for his purposes. He also selected good military advisers. These men were Barth√©lemy Louis Joseph Sch√©rer, his successor in command of the Upper Rhine Division, Desaix, Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand and his chief of staff Fran√ßois Antoine Louis Bourcier. Pichegru also had the courage to protect Desaix from dismissal for the crime of being a nobleman.Phipps (2011), p. 83 The next action was the Second Battle of Wissembourg on 25 and 26 December 1793. The Coalition forces were beaten, the Austrians retreating to the east bank of the Rhine and the Prussians falling back toward Mainz. The French were able to end the Siege of Landau which had begun on 20 August 1793.Smith (1998), p. 65 Notes References   Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Battles involving Hesse-Kassel Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles in Grand Est Category:Conflicts in 1793 ","title":"Battle of Haguenau (1793)"},{"id":"43669648","text":"Tiandao (; Vietnamese: Thi√™n ƒê·∫°o, Japanese: Tend≈ç) is a Chinese word used in many philosophical and religious contexts in China and the Sinosphere.

Early life and education  Ribera grew up in San Francisco's Richmond District where he attended George Washington High School and went on to earn a Ph.D in Public Administration from Golden Gate University.  Chief of Police  As Chief of Police, Ribera was known for his hair-trigger temper and aggressive \\"my way or the highway\\" approach which was detested in the Department. Deputy Chief Frank Reed responded to an interview about Ribera's style saying \\"Yes, we have had very lively and spirited discussions both in our private conferences and in other places, as well.

He is a German sociologist and political scientist who has resided in the UK since 1997. Previous appointments include Aston University and the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies.  Life and academic career Grundmann took his A-levels at Schelztor Gymnasium in Esslingen. He studied sociology in Berlin and received his doctorate 1989 at the European University Institute (EUI), Florence (Italy). His habilitation about environmental policy on the ozone layer challenge took place at the University of Bielefeld in 1998 under the auspices of Peter Weingart from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research, Bielefeld. Grundmann held post-doctoral positions, at the Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin, at the Graduate college Risk and private law at the University of Bremen, and at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne. In 1997 he took up a position at Aston University and is since 2012 at the University of Nottingham. Grundmann's interest in the role of expertise in modern society is influenced by frameworks such as Post-normal science and Roger Pielke Jr.'s Honest broker. Both are in line with basic works in the sociology of science and technology doubting a direct influence of \\"certain knowledge\\" or \\"settled science\\" on political decision making, which is being discussed as the linear model of science policy interaction.von Storch, H., Meinke, I., Stehr, N., Ratter, B., Krau√ü, W., Pielke, R., Grundmann, R., Reckermann, M., & Weisse, R. (2011): Regional Climate Services illustrated with experiences from Northern Europe. Zeitschrift f√ºr Umweltpolitik und Umweltrecht, 34(1), 1-15. His work challenges widespread believes in global success or failure of environmental policy as result of scientific consensus, or as an outcome of corporate power. In contrast, he shows the relevance of transnational policy networks.  Social theory  = Marxist view on Ecology = Grundmann started his academic career with an analysis of the legacy of Marx‚Äôs theory for the understanding of environmental problems. This work was a direct product of his PhD research at the EUI in Florence, in the late 1980s under the supervision of Steven Lukes. Grundmann described ecology as being no longer confined to the realms of biology since the 1970s. The term, as it had been coined in the 1870s by Ernst Haeckel, a German biologist and monist, was about a branch of biology dealing with the interaction of organisms and their surroundings. The current use of the term started to put the interaction of pollution in a political context and was later to describe a political movement as well. The thesis was published by Oxford University Press in 1991 and a related article by Grundmann himself Available online. and an answer and review of the study by Ted Benton appeared the following year in the New Left Review. The basic approach used Hans Magnus Enzensberger's Zur Kritik der politischen √ñkologieA Contribution to the Critique of Political Ecology, the title being a pun on a famous Marx study published in 1973 in the German KursbuchHans Magnus Enzensberger (1973), Zur Kritik der politischen √ñkologie', Kursbuch, 33 I It has been translated in English in Ted Bentons Greening of Marxism in the 1990s.Enzensberger, Hans Magnus (1973): A Critique of Political Ecology, in: T. Benton (Hg.), The Greening of Marxism, New York, 1996, S. 17-49. Grundmann saw orthodox marxist thinking being caught between Marx's disrespect for the idiocy of rural life and his belief in a resurrection of nature. He attempted to identify problems which could be still dealt with convincingly with Marx's thought and approach. Grundmann dealt in detail with Marx and Engels' discourse on the 'domination over nature‚Äô, which he claims of being of value. Grundmanns explicit advocacy of the term is exemptional The Political Economy of Development and Environment in Korea, A new framework for environmental analysis Jae-Yong Chung, Richard J. Kirkby Routledge, 25.07.2005, p.10 and his introduction into the topic has been quoted as late as 2010 by leading Chinese Scholars as being wonderful. * Online as: Grundmann avoided depicting the domination as being a precondition of destruction, but allowed for interpretations as mastery or stewardship. Grundmann' defence of ‚Äòmastery over nature' as a metaphor in ecologically informed socialism was however not in line with Ted Benton's interpretation of the domination term used by Marx. Benton was positive about Grundmann cutting through a lot of sloppy thinking in the ‚Äòecocentric‚Äô camp. He furthermore acknowledged that Grundmanns interpretation of Marx view of our relation to nature is insofar specific compared to e.g. Francis Bacon and Nietzsche, since in Marx‚Äôs view that ‚Äòman should make an impact on the world‚Äô. Such mastery, according to Grundmann, would be better interpreted as in mastering a musical instrument. Grundmann concluded \\"that the pursuit of productivity and the development of a healthy environment need not be mutually exclusive,\\" arguing that only specific technologies, not technology as such, lead to environmental degradation.Entry of the doctorate at Cadmus Reiner Grundmann: Marxism and Ecology Oxford, Clarendon Press/New York, Oxford University Press, 1991, Marxist introductions URI: http://hdl.handle.net/1814/24716 Whilst the book received some praise and critical attention at the time, it was published at a difficult historical juncture‚Äîafter the fall of communism there was little enthusiasm for theoretical frameworks inspired by Marx.

This move was inspired by the insight of Karl Marx that technology reveals the active transformation of nature, performed by humans and their social forms of organization.‚ÄòTechnology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of the production of the social relations of his life and of the mental conceptions that flow from these relations.‚Äô Footnote 4 in Karl Marx, Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1, trans. Ben Fowkes, Penguin Classics (London, New York: Penguin Books, 1990), p. 493. A partial return to social theory was prompted by the co-operation with Nico Stehr with whom Grundmann worked since the late 1990s. Their common work on Werner Sombart led to a re-evaluation of the legacy of this pioneering German sociologist, examining in particular his low salience in the postwar period.‚ÄòWhy is Werner Sombart not part of the core of classical sociologists? From fame to (near) oblivion‚Äô Journal of Classical Sociology 1 (2): 257‚Äì287 Reviewer Lutz Kaelber from the University of Vermont referred to Stehrs and Grundmanns edition of Werner Sombart's Economic Life in the Modern Age as a valuable and accessible addition to the Anglo-American literature on Werner Sombart. = Sustainability and large technical systems = The study of science and technology related issues led him to research large technical systems, which he did during his time at the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB) in the early 1990s. His special interest was focused on the future of automobility.Grundmann, Reiner ; Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin f√ºr Sozialforschung gGmbH (Ed.): Kommunikation und technische Infrastruktur : √ºber Schienen, Stra√üen, Sand und Perlen. Berlin, 1993 (Schriftenreihe der Forschungsgruppe \\"Gro√üe technische Systeme\\" des Forschungsschwerpunkts Technik - Arbeit - Umwelt am Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin f√ºr Sozialforschung 93-501). URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-30922 In the mid 1990s he spent three years at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne where he studied the efforts to protect the ozone layer (see as well ozone depletion and global warming). Transnational environmental policy - reconstructing Ozone was published in German in 1999 and in 2001 in English. It challenged widespread historical accounts which tend to explain the policies either as a result of scientific consensus, or as an outcome of corporate power. In contrast, it shows the relevance of transnational policy networks. The successful Montreal Protocol is often taken as an exemplar case which serves as the model for an (so far elusive) climate treaty. Grundmann claims that several problematic lessons have been drawn from this case.(2005) Ozone and Climate: Scientific consensus and leadership, Science, Technology, and Human Values 31(1): 73-101 . The book entry quotes Jim Lovelock stating This readable book is the best treatment of the subject published so far and F.Sherwood Rowland with Stimulating and thought-provoking. Grundmann, Reiner:Transnational environmental policy: reconstructing ozone Routledge studies in science, technology, and society, , http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781134592241_sample_543801.pdf Page ii  Science and technology Studies  Grundmann contributed to Science, technology and society (STS) with books about the role of experts and the power of scientific knowledge. He sees a role of science as agenda setter in the political process but stays in line with basice STS assumptions about the failure of the linear model of science and policy interaction.Compare the discussion of Collins and Evans Roger Pielke's Honest Broker assumed with regard to climate studies, that the linear model still is overwhelmingly persistent. The assumption, that STS studies critical of the linear model would automatically translate into practice would echo the very linear model under scrutiny, In a contribution to a volume in Knowledge and Democracy in 2015 Grundmann stated that those previous scholarly critiques already converted into governments attempting to improve management of public expectations on technological risk assessments. = Role of Experts = In their book on expert knowledge (English translation in 2011: Experts: The knowledge and power of expertise), Grundmann and Stehr develop a specific concept of expertise. Contrary to common definitions that stress the centrality of scientists as experts, expertise is defined as mediating between knowledge production and knowledge application. With the expansion of knowledge intensive professions, ever more persons move into positions of experts‚Äîfor some issues, some of the time. The rise of the knowledge society leads to a proliferation of knowledge sources which has not been sufficiently acknowledged by some dominant theories of expertise. A review in the Canadian Journal of Sociology pointed out that the book was published as part of Routledge‚Äôs ‚ÄúKey Ideas‚Äù series and was among the best books in this series, which attempt to both critically review the field and present arguments that reach beyond existing works. Experts: The knowledge and power of expertise got positive reviews e.g. in socialnet.de.Thorsten Benkel University of Passau) 10.15.2010 review of: Nico Stehr, Reiner Grundmann: Expertenwissen. Velbr√ºck Wissenschaft (Weilerswist) 2010. In: socialnet Rezensionen, ISSN 2190-9245, http://www.socialnet.de/rezensionen/10190.php, access 09.05.2015 Perlentaucher mentioned e.g. a positive review of Alexander Kissler in S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, stating Stehr and Grundmann would have successfully started to plough a new field. Climate change is a prominent current case which highlights the question about knowledge and decision making. Grundmann thinks that there exists a mistaken belief that the presence of a scientific consensus will enable ambitious climate policies. He considers that a much praised study overstates the case for scientific consensus.Cook et al., Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature Grundmann is in line with main STS scholars view that science hardly determines policy outcomes. Examples such acid rain ,Maarten A. Hajer, The Politics of Environmental Discourse: Ecological Modernization and the Policy Process, 1995. smoking regulations, ozone depleting substances, genetically modified foodsSusan Wright, Molecular Politics: Developing American and British Regulatory Policy for Genetic Engineering, 1972-1982 (1994). show how cultural, economic and political issues exercised a strong influence. Conversely, the presence of an international science consensus (through the IPCC) has led to different national policies, none of which is on track to achieving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that the IPCC Summary for Policymakers postulate as necessary.Reiner Grundmann (2005) Ozone and Climate: Scientific consensus and leadership, Science, Technology, and Human Values 31(1): 73-101 = Climate change = He wrote about the legacy of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy and whether it revitalized or undermined climate science and climate policy. His own experiences with peer review of another paper about the issue are described in an interview with Hans von Storch on Storch's Klimazwiebel blog.Tuesday, May 29, 2012 Interview with Reiner Grundmann by Hans von Storch According von Storch's intro, Grundmann's paper Climategate and The Scientific Ethos faced severe resistance from social science journals before it was published in Science, Technology, & Human Values. Grundmann and Stehr had themselves a controversy in the peer reviewed literature, when they clashed with Constance Lever-Tracy about the role of sociology in climate affairs. Grundmann stated a politicization of climate science which makes science, technology and society (STS) scholars feel uncomfortable with the topic of climate change. Grundmann identifies a problematic approach of climate scientists who believe to have a prerogative to make political suggestions in the field \\"which society at large should take up because scientists always know best\\" combined with a basic lack of actual feasible solution proposals. He sees climate change as a long term issue requiring more public involvement and debate, not less and asks social scientists to study the interaction between climate and society, Lever-Tracy was more about letting the climatologists having the lead. Mike Hulme noted that Grundmann (2007) pointed out some of the problems, with the circulation of IPCC knowledge or that he suggested that improvements need to be made, for example in form of improved communication. Grundmann wrote that besides the IPCC knowledge, it resulted in inaction in the United States, and that political agenda and high visibility of sceptical scientists in the media based on ‚Äòbalanced reporting‚Äô led to a bias in climate change coverage in advantage of sceptical arguments. In Germany instead, science messaging and warnings from well known scientists prevailed and resulted in climate action. Publications and books * (1991) Marxism and Ecology.

Federalist and pro-Russian insurgents quickly gained large swaths of territory. Ukraine also lost control of the Ukrainian‚ÄìRussian border and this allowed time for a large inflow of insurgents and military supplies from Russia. By August 2014 over 5,600 volunteers had joined defence battalions across Ukraine and about 7,000 volunteers had joined by the end of September. The Russian Communist Party has pushed to label the battalions as terrorist organizations, even though they are directly subordinate to the Government of Ukraine and are legal government agencies of Ukraine. Russian politicians have not pushed for declaring pro-Russian insurgents fighting in Ukraine as terrorists.

Equipment The battalions receive basic resources and weapons from the Interior Ministry or the Ministry of Defence. These resources soon proved to be inadequate and numerous groups have helped to equip the battalions. The best known volunteer groups are Self-defence of Maidan, which has its own warehouses in Melitopol, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv, and Army SOS, an initiative of former Euromaidan activists. Volunteers provide things like: hygiene items, food, sleeping bags, night vision goggles and multicopters (for use as drones).

She has established an international career having performed as a soloist with numerous orchestras, recitalist, and recording artist.  Early life and education  Augustyn was born in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland into a family of professional musicians. Her father, Roman Augustyn, was a bassoonist with the Wroc≈Çaw Opera Orchestra. He died at age 33. Her mother, Mariola Augustyn, is a professional singer (spinto soprano), music and speech therapist, and actress. Her younger brother, Jakub Augustyn, is a professional jazz guitarist. Augustyn's formal violin training started at the age of seven. She attended Pa≈Ñstwowa Podsawowa Szkola Muzyczna (now Og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖca Szko≈Ça Muzyczna I Stopnia) im. Karola Szymanowskiego in Wroc≈Çaw, where she studied violin with Aleksandra Bogdan for six years. She then enrolled in Pa≈Ñstwowe Liceum Muzyczne (now Og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖca Szko≈Ça Muzyczna II Stopnia) im. Karola Szymanowskiego in Wroc≈Çaw as a student of Zbigniew Szuflat. She graduated a year earlier than expected, having completed her baccalaureate exam. During her last year there, she was also a Jungstudentin at Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater in Rostock, Germany, where she studied violin with Petru Munteanu. At the age of 18, Augustyn came to the United States to continue her musical education at The Juilliard School. She studied with Dorothy DeLay (teacher to several renowned soloists such as Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham, and Midori Goto), Naoko Tanaka and Cho-Liang Lin. After receiving her Bachelors and master's degrees, she received a Doctorate degree (Doctor of Musical Arts) from the State University of New York, Stony Brook, where she coached violin and chamber music with Pamela Frank, Philip Setzer (violinist of the Grammy Award-winning Emerson String Quartet), and Gilbert Kalish.  Music career  Augustyn has been a soloist with the Wroc≈Çaw Philharmonic, Chamber Orchestra Leopoldinum, Magdeburg Philharmonic, Riverside Symphonia, Acadiana Symphonie, Glacier Symphony, Queens Symphony Orchestra, Deutsches Kammerorchestrer Berlin, and Manhattan Symphonie. With the Manhattan Symphonie she toured China, making her Asian debut in 2014 at the Beijing Poly Theater and Shanghai Oriental Art Center. Augustyn made her Carnegie Hall (Weill Recital Hall) recital debut in 2008 as a winner of Artist International Presentations, Inc. She has performed solo at Carnegie's Stern Auditorium, as well as at other venues in the USA such as Alice Tully Hall, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Chicago Cultural Center. She has collaborated in performances of Johann Sebastian Bach's Chaconne with the New York City-based Jos√© Lim√≥n Dance Company, established by the renowned Mexican-born modern dancer and choreographer Jos√© Lim√≥n, in multiple performances at the Joyce Theater. She often collaborates with contemporary composers and has premiered and/or made world premiere recordings of works by Kenneth Fuchs, Cynthia Lee Wong, Jakub Ciupi≈Ñski, Michael White, and Piotr Dro≈ºd≈ºewski. Augustyn is a prize winner of music competitions that include first prizes at the Alexander and Buono International String Competition in New York City in 2009, Artist International Presentations in New York City in 2007, and Konkurs Bachowski, in Zielona G√≥ra, Poland In 1999. She received Fourth Prize and Special Audience Award, the 8th International Brahms Competition in P√∂rtschach, Austria in 2001; Fourth Prize and Award for Best Interpretation of a Virtuosic Work, Kloster Sch√∂ntal International Competition, Germany in 1999. She was a 2014 recipient of the Emerging Artist Award from the Sorel Organization and a 2015 winner of the \\"Outstanding Pole Abroad\\" contest in the United States, in the category \\"Young Pole\\" from the Polish Promotional Emblem Foundation. In 2012, Augustyn recorded as part of Trio21 with Robert deMaine (principal cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic), cello, and Jeffrey Biegel, piano, The Runaway Bunny, the contemporary children's classic by Emmy award winner, Glen Roven. Narration of the story was performed by Oscar winner Catherine Zeta-Jones. In 2016 Augustyn released on the RovenRecords label, the 24 Caprices for Solo Violin, Op. 1 by Niccolo Paganini. Written between 1802 and 1817, the 24 Caprices are considered among the most challenging and technically demanding works for the solo violin, and have inspired many prominent composers, including Chopin, Schumann, Berlioz, Brahms, Sarasate, Liszt, and Sibelius. Augustyn's recording of the 24 Caprices has been praised not only for its technical accomplishment, but also for its superior musical interpretation. Augustyn marked her symphonic recording debut with the 2017 release on Centaur Records performing violin concertos by Bruch, Mendelssohn, and Massenet with the Janacek Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jakub Klecker. Augustyn also performs baroque violin and has performed in masterclasses held by William Christie (musician) and his baroque ensemble Les Arts Florissants, as well as by Cynthia Roberts. Augustyn has recorded for Naxos Records, GPR Records, RovenRecords, Albany Records, and Centaur Records. She plays on an early 18th century violin made by Antonio Zanotti, generously on loan to her from a private collector. Augustyn is currently Vice President of the New York Dance and Arts Innovations (NYDAI), a New York City-based not- for-profit organization with the aim of multi-national creative support and promotion of the performing, visual, and literary arts. In addition, she is the Artistic Director of the XXI International Chopin & Friends Festival 2019 sponsored by the NYDAI.  Interest in lesser-known works  In addition to collaboration with contemporary composers, Augustyn has performed and recorded works by lesser-known composers, as well as lesser-known works by prominent composers of the past. She is the first person to record all violin and piano works by the 19th century composer, Aleksander Zarzycki, who was mainly known for his Mazurka in G Major, Op. 26 that was frequently performed by David Oistrakh. Other world premiere recordings include works by Henryk Gorecki, P. Dro≈ºd≈ºewski, and Karol Lipinski. In 2018, Augustyn's second orchestral release was a performance of works by the Polish composer, Romuald Twardowski. The recording was released by Naxos Records and includes Twardowski's Violin Concerto (2006).

It effectively overruled Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] AC 488 in NZ case law. Background Horsburgh was a member of the local meat workers union. In order to support its striking members at a nearby plant, the union required all its members to contribute to a $10 a week strike fund. Horsburgh refused to make these payments, resulting in his expulsion from the union, and due to compulsory unionism at the time, he then lost his job. It was later discovered that the strike levy was illegal to collect, due to it not being first subject to a secret ballot. He sued the union for loss of income, as well as for the distress for losing his job. Held The court of appeal awarded him $8,000 for the distress of losing his job. This was on the basis that this case involved not an employment issue, but for wrongly being expelled from the union, a tenuous basis, considering the loss of his union membership did result in him losing his job.

IEEE, 2014.

The set of learners and the set of teachers in an SLN cannot be disjoint. Rather, an SLN is an evolving peer learning process in which learners acquire, master, and then themselves disseminate knowledge to others over time. At any given time, an actor in an SLN is a teacher of concepts she has mastered, and a learner of those she is not yet familiar with. Collaborative learning has been identified as an important part of SLN formation, because actors can work together and combine their respective skills to solve problems.Huang, Jeff JS, et al. \\"Social Learning Networks: Build Mobile Learning Networks Based on Collaborative Services.\\" Educational Technology & Society 13.3 (2010): 78-92.  Applications  A number of learning scenarios that give rise to social learning networks have been identified. Some of these have a designated teacher and/or teaching staff, while others rely entirely on peer-based instruction: * Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where learning content is created by a designated instructor and/or teaching staff, and the primary means of interaction between students are discussion forums. Since the student bodies of MOOC can reach hundreds of thousands in size, the teacher-to-student ratios are typically fractions of one percent.Christopher Brinton, Mung Chiang, Shaili Jain, Henry Lam, Zhenming Liu, and Felix Ming Fai Wong. \\"Learning about social learning in moocs: From statistical analysis to generative model.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.2159 (2013). As a result of this, peer-based learning has been found to be critical to the scalability of the learning process.Glance, David George, Martin Forsey, and Myles Riley. \\"The pedagogical foundations of massive open online courses.\\" First Monday 18.5 (2013). * Flipped classrooms (FLIP), where class time is primarily used for discussion of course material, rather than as a traditional lecture period. Compared with MOOC, the SLN for FLIP will be at least partially formed through face-to-face communication.Herreid, Clyde Freeman, and Nancy A. Schiller. \\"Case studies and the flipped classroom.\\" Journal of College Science Teaching 42.5 (2013): 62-66. * Training and development initiatives in which the instructor puts particular emphasis on social learning. For example, corporations will sometimes encourage enterprise social networking among employees and supply an internal networking service for this purpose.DiMicco, Joan, et al. \\"Motivations for social networking at work.\\" Proceedings of the 2008 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work. ACM, 2008. * Question and answer sites (Q&A;), where there is typically a common forum on which users can post questions, answer questions, comment on answers, and up/down-vote posts. The SLN on Q&A; sites is formed entirely through social interaction on these forums.Anderson, Ashton, et al. \\"Discovering value from community activity on focused question answering sites: a case study of stack overflow.\\" Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining. ACM, 2012. * Review sites, where contributors learn from one another through a collective sharing of knowledge about experiences with items. * Books&Stuff; An online Books site where all the students can read and rating books who have read in their classe, created in the 2015 by two young students and developers, Adriano Lopez de Onate and Luigi Ruggeri  Graph Types  The structure and dynamics of a social learning network can be represented through a graph. Different combinations of node types and link/weight definitions will yield different properties about the network. Dynamic functionalities on top of these graphs, meaning how they evolve over time in terms of the number of nodes, links, and weights, can be captured too. At least four graph types have been identified: * Undirected graph of learners, where the nodes in the graph are learners, and the (possibly weighted) links are used to indicate the presence or absence of some characteristic(s) between them. These properties can be definitive measures, such as geographic location or whether they have interacted, or measures that may be more difficult to quantify, such as the number of concepts each learner has mastered in common. * Directed graph of learners, where directed (and possibly weighted) links can be used to represent the flow of information between learners in a social network. These can take the form of a multigraph, because it is possible for there to be more than one interaction between two learners. * Undirected graph of learners and concepts, where the concepts of discussion in the networks can also be represented as a second type of node. These concepts can be extracted from the discussions between learners by running content analysis on the discussions. One possible representation of the relationships between learners and concepts is through a bipartite graph. * Directed graph of learners and concepts, where a graph that includes both learner and concept nodes is directed to indicate the flow of information through the network.

The book was released on November 12, 2013 by Little, Brown and Company. Synopsis The book tells a story of a woman whose real name is Etna Bliss, but she doesn't remember it due to her concussion which turn out to be a hysteria that she got when she ran away from her American husband to London. There, she becomes an ambulance driver serving during World War I. During one of her shifts, while wearing only VAD uniform she got hit by a bombardment. After it, she is being awoken at the Abyssinian hospital with shell shock. A cranial surgeon and psychologist named August Bridge finds her in that state next year in London, and becomes her mentor for a time being. While in his care, Etna begins to draw houses and people that she knew of but couldn't remember from where. Later on, she begins to remember someone from Admiralty and demanded Dr. Bridge to go there because she had a hutch that she have someone there. Following her trip, she finds Samuel, an officer who invites her to a restaurant. It turns out to be a person she truly loved when they along with his brother Phillip, immigrated to Camiers before the war happened there in 1915. Following long court proceedings which started in February 1917, despite being diagnosed with shell shock, she wins custody over her adult children Clara and Nicholas only by 1930. Reception The book received mixed reviews, with The Harvard Crimson saying \\"Shreve cannot control dialogue rhythm and the reader's visualization of the scene without relying on punctuation to do her work,\\" hinting on the author's weak parts of the story. USA Today, on the other hand, gave it three stars, saying that \\"If there is a fault in the author's writing then its only the fact that she made it more to be a love story rather than a war one\\". Jim Higgins of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said that the book was reminiscent of Pat Barker's Regeneration. It was also reviewed by such newspapers as the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, the Boston Globe, the Washington Post, and Toronto Star.

Biography Rimington was born in 1739 or 1740. Nothing is known of his parents or early life. He enlisted in the Royal Artillery in 1757 as a matross. He received a commission as a Second Lieutenant on 15 March 1771. In April 1771 he embarked for Quebec, went thence to Montreal, and in August proceeded with a detachment to Fort Niagara. In June 1773 he returned to Quebec, and embarked for England. In December 1775 he went on the recruiting service. In March 1776 he sailed with four companies of artillery for Quebec, and was placed on Lord Dorchester's staff. Rimmington was present at the Battle of Trois-Rivi√®res under Dorchester on 8 June that year. He commanded one of the gunboats in the Battle of Valcour Island, during which Dorchester attacked the American Lake Champlain fleet. In July 1777, he crossed Lake Champlain under General John Burgoyne, and was appointed commissary of horse by Major-General William Phillips. He was present at the Battle of Freeman's Farm on 19 September, as well as at the later actions of the Saratoga campaign, until Burgoyne's army surrendered. He was a prisoner in the Convention Army until being exchanged and released in 1781. On 7 July 1779, while still in captivity, he was promoted to Lieutenant. After his release, Rimington was assigned to the artillery at New York, and commanded a detachment of artillery at Poleshook and Kingsbridge. While there, he was promoted to Captain on 1 December 1782. When peace was agreed in 1783 he received orders to dismantle these posts, and send the guns and ammunition on board the transports. In October of the same year he received a warrant from Lord Dorchester to proceed to Bermuda to inspect and disband the garrison battalion, which took place in May 1784. He then returned to England, but in 1787 left for Canada, where he remained for some four years. In February 1791, he was appointed to command the artillery in Scotland, a post he held for eleven years. On 1 January 1798, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1802, owing to ill-health, Rimington was allowed to retire to the invalid battalion of the Royal Artillery at Woolwich. While in retirement at the invalid battalion, he was promoted to Colonel in 1808, Major-General in 1811, and Lieutenant-General in 1821. He died at his home in Woolwich on 26 January 1826, aged 86.

The Linked Data Platform allows use of RESTful HTTP to consume, create, update and delete both RDF and non-RDF resources. In addition, it defines a set of \\"Container\\" constructs ‚Äì buckets into which documents can be added with a relationship between the bucket and the object similar to the relationship between a blog and its constituent blog posts.  History  LDP evolved from work at IBM's Rational Product Group for application integration. Starting in 2010, IBM looked at linked data for application lifecycle management and sought what was an alternative means for Read‚ÄìWrite Linked Data. IBM joined with the W3C in June 2012 to form a W3C working group, which operated until July 2015. On 26 February 2015, the W3C Linked Data Platform 1.0 was approved as a W3C Recommendation.  Implementation  Read‚ÄìWrite Linked data was previously described using WebDAV and SPARUL by Tim Berners-Lee in his design issues that built upon his 4 rules for linked data. The Linked Data Platform includes Tim Berners-Lee's 4 rules, and focuses on the following concepts. = LDP Resources (LDPR) = * HTTP and RDF techniques to read and write linked data * Resources can be created, modified, deleted and read using standard HTTP methods (i.e., POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, GET) * Cover \\"RDF sources\\" as well as \\"binary resources\\" = LDP Containers (LDPC) = * An LDPR to which you POST to create new things, GET to find existing things * Similar to what AtomPub does for XML * Available in three flavors: BasicContainer, DirectContainer, and IndirectContainer = Paging & Ordering = * A mechanism to get the content of a LDPC in chunks and specify the order in which the content is sorted  LDP and WebDAV Relationship  LDP is not a file system, but it uses Linked Data to produce the kind of information that can be used to create a modern file system abstraction for interacting with HTTP-accessible resources (colloquially referred to as \\"Web Resources\\"). In contrast, WebDAV is a \\"set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers\\". However, LDP can be used with WebDAV. For example, there are live LDP containers in the wild, identified by Linked Data URIs, that can also function as WebDAV endpoints (i.e., mountable by any WebDAV compliant User Agent).

The film is the sequel to The Da Vinci Code (2006) and Angels & Demons (2009), and is the third and final installment in the Robert Langdon film series. It stars Tom Hanks, reprising his role as Robert Langdon, alongside Felicity Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Omar Sy, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Ben Foster, and Irrfan Khan. Filming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy, and wrapped on July 21, 2015, in Budapest. The film premiered in Florence on October 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on October 28, 2016, ten years after release of The Da Vinci Code, in 2D and IMAX formats. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but grossed $220 million against a production budget of $75 million. Plot Harvard University professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in Florence, Italy, with no memory of what has transpired over the last few days, but being plagued with hellish visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks, the doctor tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. An orderly says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the orderly while coming up the hallway. Brooks helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment. Among Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Brooks find a Faraday pointer, a miniature image projector with a modified version of Sandro Botticelli's Map of Hell, which itself is based on Dante's Inferno. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a dangerously unstable villain who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's growing population, and who committed suicide three days earlier after being chased by armed government agents. Langdon and Brooks figure out that Zobrist, who was obsessed with Dante, has created a fictional superweapon he has dubbed \\"Inferno\\", with the potential of annihilating half the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and government agents, who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The government agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called \\"The Consortium\\", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability. Langdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and Venice, while inadvertently killing Vayentha and evading the agents. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he helped a friend of his steal and hide the Dante death mask, a crucial clue, an event he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the attack, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Brooks are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man purporting to be working for the government, warning them that Sinskey has a double agenda and is after the Inferno for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again. Langdon figures out that the attack is in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. With that knowledge, Brooks abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the weapon. Zobrist and Brooks used to play treasure hunt games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard, but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Brooks to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with benzodiazepine to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged. They realize the weapon is in a plastic bag hidden under water in the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The agents team - joined by Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey - race to locate and secure the bag, while Brooks and her allies attempt to detonate an explosive that will rupture the bag and aerosolize the weapon. Sims is killed by Brooks, and when Langdon confronts her, she attempts to release the weapon by triggering a suicide bombing. The detonation is able to rupture the bag but because it was already trapped in a special containment unit, the weapon was secured in time, and after struggling in vain against Sinskey and Langdon to destroy the container, Brooks' allies are killed. The weapon is then taken, and Langdon goes back to Florence in order to return the Dante Death Mask.

Production On July 16, 2013, Columbia Pictures set Ron Howard to direct Dan Brown's fourth novel in the Robert Langdon series, Inferno, with David Koepp writing the script. Imagine Entertainment was set to produce the film, while Tom Hanks was again set to reprise his role as Robert Langdon. On August 26, 2014, Sony had finalized the deal with Howard and Hanks, and set the film for April start of production in Italy. Brian Grazer was also set to produce the film with Howard. On December 2, Felicity Jones was in early talks to join the film. On February 17, 2015, studio revealed the confirmed cast for the film, including Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Omar Sy as Christoph Bruder, Irrfan Khan as Harry \\"The Provost\\" Sims, and Sidse Babett Knudsen as Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the World Health Organization. Ben Foster was set for an unspecified villainous role on March 10, 2015, which later revealed to be the role of Bertrand Zobrist. =Filming= Filming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy, and continued in Florence, Italy, starting at the end of April. Outdoor scenes featuring Hanks were filmed near the Palazzo Vecchio and elsewhere in the historic center of the city, starting on May 2, 2015. Some second unit stunts were filmed at an apartment building close to the Ponte Vecchio, in Florence. Low-flying aerial shots of Florence landmarks, its river and bridges were filmed on May 11, 2015. A sequence displayed in an early trailer features a Padova railway station sign, but locals of Padova immediately recognized the scene as recreated somewhere else.

History  Founded in 1899 as \\"Onderlinge Pharmaceutische Groothandel\\" (English: Mutual Pharmaceutical Wholesale Company), it was a cooperative association of apothecaries who did not want medicine to be supplied by unauthorised people, and who started creating their own pharmaceuticals on a small scale.

In 2009 the name was finally changed to Mediq NV, the current official name.

In 1879 he graduated from the exclusive St. Mary Magdalene high school in Breslau. He then studied economics at the universities of Berlin, Geneva and Bonn. Later the studies prepared him to manage the wealth of the Hochberg family in Silesia. At the age of 22 Hans Heinrich XV, the son of a duke (Herzog von Pless) received from Emperor Wilhelm I a lower princely title and officially became the F√ºrst von Pless (Prince of Pless). In the years 1881‚Äì1882 he served in the German Imperial Army, first as a volunteer in the Royal Hussar regiment and later the Guard Hussars. After two years he left the army as a lieutenant. Between 1882 and 1885 he participated in a long, eventful hunting trip around the world and visited, among others, India and North America. After his return, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin, Germany. There he met and became friend with the young heir to the throne William Hohenzollern (later Emperor Wilhelm II). In 1886, Hans Heinrich XV was moved to a diplomatic post in Brussels, and a year later he became an attach√© at the embassy in Paris.:pl:Jan Henryk XV Hochberg ksiƒÖ≈ºƒô von Pless =Career and First Marriage= Pless Castle in Pszczyna was the official residence of the Hochbergs In 1890, Hans Heinrich XV was awarded the position of secretary at the German embassy in London. There he met and proposed to the younger Mary Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West called Daisy. Since the Cornwallis-West family was impoverished, the Hochbergs were forced to pay and organise the wedding. The wedding ceremony took place at St. Margaret's in Westminster on 8 December 1891. Notable witnesses were Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and his wife Princess Alexandra, while Queen Victoria personally gave the couple her blessing. They began their married life by traveling throughout Europe, Africa, Asia and America. As a wedding gift from Hans Heinrich XI, the senior head of the house, the young couple received Schloss F√ºrstenstein near Waldenburg , where they hosted the finest European aristocracy throughout their entire marriage. The couple had four children:Jan Henryk XV von Pless in: genealogia.grocholski.pl [retrieved 5 February 2015]. *Daughter (25 February 1893 ‚Äì 11 March 1893). *Hans Heinrich XVII William Albert Edward (2 February 1900 ‚Äì 26 January 1984), Prince of Pless, Count von Hochberg and Baron of F√ºrstenstein. Married twice but had no issue. *Alexander Frederick William George Conrad Ernest Maximilian (1 February 1905 ‚Äì 22 February 1984), Prince of Pless, Count von Hochberg and Baron of F√ºrstenstein. Unmarried and childless. *Bolko Conrad Frederick (23 September 1910 ‚Äì 22 June 1936), married his stepmother (the second wife of his father) Clotilde de Silva y Gonz√°lez de Candamo (19 July 1898 ‚Äì 12 December 1978) and caused a scandal. They had two children. Since 1902 Hans Heinrich XV, as one of the representatives of the Prussian House of Lords, was a supporter of the Free Conservative Party (Freikonserwative Vereinigung) that represented and supported the interests of wealthy and influential landowners. At the provincial level Hans Heinrich XV served as Vice President of the Silesian province (1897‚Äì1918) and also participated in the work of the Silesian provincial parliament. Additionally, he was the chairman of the Pless Regional Council (Kreistag). In November 1902 he travelled to the United States as a diplomatic representative of Kaiser Wilhelm II and took part in the inauguration of the German Chamber of Commerce, visited several industrial plants (including the one in Pennsylvania), and the highlight of the trip was a visit to the White House and a conversation with President Theodore Roosevelt. =Prince of Pless and Second Marriage= Hochberg family tomb in Pszczyna After his father's death in 1907, Hans Heinrich XV became the Prince of Pless and the owner of the largest estates in the German Empire ‚Äì In Pless (Pszczyna) (approx. 40 thousand hectares of land, 6 coal mines, a brewery in Tychy and others) and in Waldenburg (Wa≈Çbrzych) (approx. 10 thousand hectares and 3 coal mines). These assets systematically decreased due to debt caused by the profligate lifestyle of the family and huge architectural investments (including the reconstruction of the KsiƒÖ≈º Castle). However between 1914 and 1924 he made many industrial investments in the Upper and Lower Silesia (expansion of mines). He financially supported the German nationalist organisations (e.g. Deutscher Flottenverein), however, opposed the activities Ostmarkenverein in his Upper Silesian estates. During World War I he was promoted to the rank of a colonel and served as an officer. In the years 1915‚Äì1917 he lent his castle in Pless to the German Army. After the war all of his estates in Pless became Polish and the city was renamed to Pszczyna. In 1922 he received Polish citizenship. In order to win the favour of the Polish authorities he often relied on his Piast roots and hosted the representatives of the Polish political establishment in his castles. On 22 October of that year he divorced Princess Daisy. On 25 January 1925 in London he married secondly Clotilde de Silva y Gonz√°lez de Candamo (19 July 1898 ‚Äì 12 December 1978), a Spanish noblewoman and daughter of the 10th Marquis de Arcic√≥llar. They had two children: *Beatrice Maria Luise Margaret (born 15 July 1929). Married twice and has issue. *Conrad Joseph Hans (12 June 1930 ‚Äì 29 November 1934). This marriage also ended in a divorce in 1934 because of the family scandal ‚Äì the seduction of the youngest son of Hans Heinrich XV ‚Äì Bolko ‚Äì by his stepmother. They subsequently married and had two children, Hedwig Maria and Bolko Constantine, the only grandchildren of Hans Heinrich XV. As a result of the global economic crisis, the Lower Silesian estates belonging to the Hochbergs fell into debt. In 1936, against the pressures of creditors Hans Heinrich XV left Waldenburg (now KsiƒÖ≈º) and came to Pszczyna, where his son Hans Heinrich XVII fought tax disputes with the Polish authorities, which became the heading of international media. Finally Hans Heinrich himself led to the end of the crisis by signing in 1937 an agreement in which the Hochbergs lost the privilege of mining in Pszczyna and lost control over the tax system. Eventually the Polish state took over 56% of his assets. =Last years= He died of a heart attack on 31 January 1938 in the Ritz Hotel in Paris and was buried in Pszczyna. During World War II his surviving sons both fought against the Nazis, Hans Heinrich XVII as John Henry Pless in the British RAF and Alexander Hochberg under the name of Aleksander Pszczy≈Ñski as the shooter in the Polish Army under the command of General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders.

This is especially pronounced when the biomolecule has rigidity in its structure such as double stranded DNA. In turn, the changes caused by electrical potentials can be used to affect the biological function of the biomolecule by revealing or changing the access to molecular targets.  Label free molecular interaction  The biomolecule (for instance double stranded DNA) bound to the biosurface can be used to tether a label free target in a label free interaction model. By applying a variable or alternating potential to the biosurface, the biomolecules can be moved systematically. In turn the movement can be measured in real time using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of the fluorescence quenching of an attached fluorescent marker molecule. By analyzing the speed of the biomolecule as it is dragged through the buffer solution by the electric field, the binding of a ligand can be measured in real time. Since the speed of the biomolecule and a bound ligand depend on their hydrodynamic friction the method can be used to measure the size of the biomolecule and/or of the ligand. This can also be directly applied to detect conformational changes of the biomolecule and/or the ligand. It competes with technologies including surface plasmon resonance. Recently, electrical stimulus has also been utilized to influence the binding between a protein and its ligand which could be incorporated into smart surfaces for controlled molecular release.

Early life Born on 15 January 1831 at West Meon in Hampshire, where his father James Benham was postmaster, he was educated at the village school. Its founder, the rector Henry Vincent Bayley, made him his secretary, taught him Greek and Latin, and at his death left instructions that the boy's education should be continued. Benham was sent in 1844 to St. Mark's College, Chelsea, recently established under Derwent Coleridge, to be trained as a schoolmaster. On completing his course he taught in a rural school, and was tutor to John Sebright between 1849 and 1852. With the support of Bayley's family he was able to attend the theological department of King's College, London, where his religious position was influenced by F. D. Maurice. Priest In 1857 Benham was ordained deacon, and priest in 1858. He was appointed divinity tutor and lecturer in English literature at St. Mark's, Chelsea, still under Coleridge. He remained there until in 1865 he became editorial secretary to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. At the same time he engaged in Sunday ministerial work as curate of St. Lawrence Jewry, under Benjamin Morgan Cowie. From 1866 to 1871 he was also professor of modern history at Queen's College, Harley Street, in succession to Maurice. Benham's preaching attracted the attention of Archbishop Charles Longley, who made him in 1867 first vicar of his local parish of Addington, where the archbishop resided. Longley was in poor health: Benham acted as his private secretary during the period of the first Lambeth Conference in 1867, and was with him at his death in 1868. Longley's successor Archibald Campbell Tait gave him the Lambeth degree of B.D., made him one of the six preachers of Canterbury, and in 1872 gave him the vicarage of Margate. In Margate Benham restored the parish church, and was chairman of the first school board of the town. In 1880 Tait made him vicar of Marden and in 1882 he was appointed rector of St. Edmund the King with St. Nicholas Acons, Lombard Street, a post he held for life. In 1888 Archbishop Edward White Benson made him honorary canon of Canterbury, and in 1898 Hartford University, U.S.A., granted him the degree of D.D. He was Boyle lecturer in 1897, and rural dean of East City from 1903 till his death. Death Benham died of heart failure on 30 July 1910, and was buried at Addington. Work Benham was a prolific writer. The Life of Archbishop Tait (1891), with Randall Davidson, was the major work of his later life. He also edited the memoirs of Catherine and Craufurd Tait, the wife and son of the archbishop (1879; abridged edit. 1882). His other main works were: alt=Engraving of a church building * The Gospel according to St. Matthew ‚Ä¶ with Notes, 1862. * The Epistles for the Christian Year with Notes, 1865. * The Church of the Patriarchs, 1867. * A short History of the Episcopal Church in the United States, 1884. * Winchester (in \\"Diocesan Histories\\" series), 1884. * Sermons for the Church's Year, original and selected, 2 vols. 1883‚Äì4. * The Dictionary of Religion; an Encyclop√¶dia of Christian and other Religious Doctrines, ‚Ä¶ Terms, History, Biography, 1887; reissued 1891, begun by John Henry Blunt. * Winchester Cathedral, 1893; illustrated, 1897. * Rochester Cathedral, 1900 (both of these in \\"English Cathedrals\\" series). * Medi√¶val London, 1901 and 1911, with Charles Welch. * Old St. Paul's Cathedral, 1902. * The Tower of London, 1906 (all three of these in the \\"Portfolio Monographs\\"). * St. John and his Work (\\"Temple\\" series of Bible handbooks), 1904. * Old London Churches, 1908. * Letters of Peter Lombard, 1911, posthumous, with a preface by Randall Davidson.

Benham produced an edition of William Cowper's poetry in 1870; published in 1873 a Companion to the Lectionary (new edition 1884); and translated The Imitation of Christ (1874; new ed. 1905). He edited the reprint series Ancient and Modern Library of Theological Literature. Lombard Street in Lent (1894), addresses by various preachers, presented the kind of sermon which he thought a City church should supply to attract businessmen in their lunch hour.

Her friend leaves college because an eve teaser, the son of the Central Minister (Suman), bothers her. When he comes to trouble her for supporting her friend, he gets beaten up by a co-student named Gagan Chakravarthy (Bellamkonda Sreenivas), his father Chakravarthy (Sarath Kumar), and his brother Prudhvi (Nandu). The Central Minister then makes it a point to take Gagan and his family down. Gagan, Chakravarthy, and Pruthvi are best friends and liquor buddies and only have each other, since Gagan's and Pruthvi's mother died (Chakravarthy's wife). They do everything from drinking alcohol to eating roadside foods and beating up wrongdoers in society. Sweety starts getting attracted to Gagan, and they start to hang out, and she gets to know about his family. She comes to Gagan's house and makes a change in their lifestyle for their own sake, for which Chakravarthy happily agrees for. In the meantime, Sweety, learns about Pruthvi's love failure and ends up reconciling with the would-be bride's parents, and the marriage is conducted in a grand manner. Chakravarthy, upon seeing the happiness and joy in the atmosphere at the wedding, realizes that Sweety is the reason behind everything and asks Gagan to always be by her side, and if he is not by her side one day, then Chakravarthy and his family as good as dead. In a parallel track, the CM attends the engagement of the daughter of a very rich and ruthless businessman, Aswith Narayana Varma (Jagapathi Babu). The would-be groom, however, finds a video of Narayana's daughter romancing and kissing another guy that she liked before the engagement. The groom shows Narayana and tells him about this. The next morning, in breaking news on TV, it is revealed that Narayana has intentionally killed the groom in fear of his pride being destroyed. Narayana says that the thing that he cares about the most in the world in his pride, and he will go to any extent to preserve it. He leaves a gun on the table, and his daughter picks it up and shoots herself. Narayana and his company plan to build a highway that will make his company the most successful company in all of Asia, but his son Veerendra (Shashank) reveals that the project has competition in the form of the biggest liquor don in North India, Arjun Pawar(Tarun Arora). Arjun is supported by his two brothers and has bought off all of Narayana's close associates and subordinates except for his lawyer JP (Jayaprakash). Arjun threatens JP, stating that if he does not agree to his terms, that his daughter should marry his youngest brother; otherwise, he will kill her. JP agrees out of fear. Narayana, however, retaliates and sends Veerendra to kill Arjun's brother and breaks up the back and puts him in a critical condition. Now, Arjun then decides to hit back. Sweety realizes that she is truly in love with Gagan and expresses her feelings towards him. Gagan is delighted, and Sweety takes him to her house to her father JP, where he insults him after realizing his lifestyle and the reputation that Chakravarthy has in society, then proceeds to insult Sweety. Enraged, Gagan gives JP a warning, but Sweety, who cares for her father's life more than anything, sends Gagan away and tells him to never come back. Heartbroken, Gagan drives and tries to forget Sweety but is unable to and gets into a car accident. Fearing for his life, Chakravarthy and his uncle send him away with known relatives in Vizag. Faluguni (Pragya Jaiswal) arrives at the airport and picks Gagan up, and Gagan realizes that her lifestyle is young, wild, and free. Falguni, however, has no interest in Gagan romantically. While driving back after a party on the beach. Gagan witnesses a family being attacked. He decides to save them, and they turn out to be Narayana's family, and Arjun's brother has been sent to finish them off. Narayana's family pleads Gagan to save them and their daughter-in-law. Gagan fights off some of Pawar's men and saves the daughter-in-law, who happens to be Sweety. Shocked, Gagan is then shot four times and is left for dead. The doctors end up saving him, and then the flashback is revealed by Narayana's wife (Sithara). After breaking Arjun's brother's back, Narayana then met JP, and they decide to get Veerendra married with Sweety. At the wedding, as Veerendra is about to tie the knot, he is shot and killed, and Arjun's men come and kidnap everyone to kill them. Since Veerendra died at the hands of Arjun, JP has no choice but to let her daughter away from the Narayana family. However, Narayana's sister (Vani Viswanath) phones her brother and tells him that they need Sweety, since she is almost married to Veerendra, and decided to adopt Sweety as their daughter- in-law. Since her would-be husband is dead, Sweety becomes a poor widow with no family emotions. Gagan then vows to protect Sweety until he dies and will solve all her problems. Narayana's sister comes and says that the family must perform a pooja at the Hamsala Deevi river area. She sees Gagan, who says that he cannot come along. Narayana's sister, in reality, has cut a deal with Arjun to get Sweety and leave her family alone, and Arun agrees. As Narayana and the rest of his family perform the pooja, they attacked by Arjun's men. As they are about to attack Sweety, Gagan emerges from the water along with Chakravarthy and Nandu and kills everyone. He takes Sweety along with him, and Narayana feels that his pride has once again been damaged. Then, the Central Minister enrages both Narayana and Arjun on Gagan, so they both join hands with each other in eliminating Gagan once and for all. In the attack, Chakravarthy and Pruthvi are seriously injured, and Narayana kidnaps Sweety. Gagan then lugs his injured brother and father to where Sweety is being kept and kills everyone but Narayana. Finally, Gagan says that Narayana lost his pride a long time ago. As Narayana is listening to this, he shoots himself and dies. Chakravarthy decides to get Gagan married to Sweety and asks what name she would like on the wedding card. Sweety says \\"Janaki\\", and the film ends on a happy note.

Devi Sri Prasad was declared as the music director, Arthur A. Wilson was declared as the cinematographer, A. S. Prakash was declared as the art director while the story and dialogues were written by M. Rathnam.

However, Sreenivas confirmed that his father would produce the film and it has been delayed due to story discussions but not due to financial problems. =Casting= Early reports said that Shruti Haasan would be selected as the female lead of the film. However, in a press meet, Bellamkonda Suresh said that the female lead is yet to be finalized and discussions are going on.

On the day of launch, Boyapati Srinu said that another heroine will act in a guest role. Reports in mid-October 2014 suggested that Tamannaah may opt out of the film as she has to accommodate dates for Baahubali and for a Tamil film. In early November 2014, it was known that Sreenivas is working on his body language and would sport a new look for the film. Due to the halt in the project, search for the female lady began in January 2016 and was reported that makers are keen on signing Shruti Haasan or Rakul Preet Singh.\\"Toss-up between Rakul and Shruti\\" On 17 January 2016 it was confirmed that Rakul Preet Singh was signed in as a female lead on paying her an amount of .\\"Rakul Preet hikes fee, charges Rs 0.25 crore\\" Aadhi Pinisetty was roped in to play a crucial role.

By the 1950s, the village consisted of around 80 cottages, a sweet shop, a Co-op store and a school. There was also a woollen mill. In 1958, Heywood and Middleton Water Board decided that another reservoir was needed to supply water to the growing population of Rochdale and started construction of Greenbooth Reservoir that same year.

During his seclusion, Knight lived within a mile of summer cabins in a crude camp he built in a well-drained woodland obscured within a cluster of glacial erratic boulders. Having entered the woods with almost no possessions, he set up a camp composed entirely of items stolen from nearby cabins and camps. He survived by committing approximately 1,000 burglaries against houses in the area, at a rate of approximately 40 per year, to be able to survive during the harsh winters of Maine. Apart from the fear and notoriety his many burglaries created in the local area, Knight's unusual life also attracted widespread international media reports upon his capture.The New York Times article: \\"'The Stranger in the Woods' for 27 Years: Maine's 'North Pond Hermit' Journalist Michael Finkel wrote an in-depth story about the incident for the GQ magazine, and later wrote a book titled The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit. Life and seclusion Christopher Knight entered the woods in 1986 at 20 years of age, saying goodbye to no one. His parents never reported him missing to the police. In an interview, Knight said, \\"I had good parents\\", and, \\"We're not emotionally bleeding all over each other. We're not touchy-feely. Stoicism is expected.\\" At the time of his notoriety, a neighbor who lived near Knight's childhood home reported that for fourteen years they had exchanged no more than a few words with Knight's mother. Knight survived the bitterly cold Maine winters (with temperatures dipping as low as ) by waking up during the coldest part of the night and pacing his camp until warm. He regularly took cold sponge baths, shaved, and cut his hair, in part to avoid suspicion in the event he was spotted by others. He avoided building smoky fires which might reveal the location of his camp, but relied upon a propane camp stove to cook and melt snow for drinking and bathing. Stolen propane cylinders were transported in canoes borrowed from vacant camps. He quietly paddled along the shadowy shoreline in the pre-dawn hours to avoid being silhouetted on open water. Knight concealed thefts by sprinkling pine needles over the canoes he had used when he returned them. He stockpiled supplies to remain in his camp from November through March to avoid revealing his location by footprints on snow-covered ground. Many have expressed admiration for Knight's outdoor survival skills, especially in the harsh Maine winters. Some also expressed doubt, saying that Knight might have broken into and taken refuge in vacant cabins. =Encounters with others during seclusion= At the time of his arrest, Knight claimed there was only one instance during his 27 years of solitude in which he spoke with another human: at some point in the 1990s, he exchanged the word \\"hi\\" with a hiker whom he encountered on a lightly traveled path. Biographer Michael Finkel later reported that around February 2013, a fisherman named Tony Bellavance (along with his son and grandson) had discovered Knight in his camp, two months before he was apprehended by police. Knight later admitted to having been discovered by the fishermen, but had not mentioned it to police at the time of his arrest because the group swore a pact to not tell anyone of their meeting (after the anglers learned that Knight simply wanted to be left alone). Capture and aftermath Knight was captured by game warden Sergeant Terry Hughes on April 4, 2013, while burgling the Pine Tree Camp in Rome, Maine. He was sentenced to seven months in jail on October 28, 2013, of which he had already served all but a week while awaiting sentencing. In addition to the jail sentence, Knight paid $2,000 in restitution to victims, completed a Co- Occurring Disorders Court Program (designed for people with substance abuse problems and mental health disorders), and completed three years of probation. Knight has described deep-felt ethical misgivings about the burglaries committed, saying that stealing is wrong. Even the prosecutor said a longer sentence would have been cruel. Judge Nancy Mills believes it is very unlikely that Knight will re-offend. After release, Knight met with the judge every week, avoided alcohol, and secured a job with his brother. Journalist Michael Finkel met with Knight for nine one-hour sessions while he was in jail. This was the genesis for first an article in GQ magazine in August 2014, and then the book The Stranger In The Woods, published in March 2017. Knight was largely reluctant to express any inkling of motives or insights gained through his experience, but he did offer that \\"solitude bestows an increase in something valuable... my perception. But... when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for... To put it romantically, I was completely free.\\" Finkel compared this observation to similar statements by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles de Foucauld, and Thomas Merton.

The settlement was in use from about the late 2nd century BC to the early 1st century BC. By surface area, Heidengraben is the largest oppidum in all of mainland Europe. Geography Heidengraben is situated in the municipalities of Grabenstetten, H√ºlben and Erkenbrechtsweiler in the districts of Reutlingen and Esslingen in southern Germany. It sits on a part of the high plateau of the Swabian Jura at the steep escarpment known as Albtrauf which rises as much as 400 m above the foothills. This area is known as the Grabenstettener Halbinsel. Height above sea level is around 700 m. The outer fortifications delineate an area of over 1,700 hectares, making this oppidum the largest known in mainland Europe. The 2.5 km long walls make strategic use of the escarpment to create this large area surrounded either by wall or steep bluff. The walls cut off the inner area from the rest of the plateau and also divide it from three sections that are hard to fortify or oversee. In front of the wall was a moat. The rampart, in parts still about 3 m high, has eight gates ‚Äì variants of the late Celtic . One of them, with a 35 m long entry way, is one of the largest and best-preserved of its kind. The inner fortification, to the south-west, named Elsachstadt, likely marking the core of the Celtic settlement, covers around 153 hectares. It is surrounded by part of the outer wall and another inner rampart with a double moat and three gates. Not much is known about the internal settlement structures, however, as the buildings were made of wood and the area has been subject to erosion and been used for agriculture for centuries. Only the Elsachstadt was apparently also fortified in the direction of the escarpment. Overall, there are around half a dozen wall segments visible today, varying in length from a few hundred to over 1,000 m. They are what is known as Pfostenschlitzmauern constructed of rocks, wood and earth. History Burial mounds at Burrenhof Heidengraben at Elsachstadt Stone artefacts indicate that humans frequented the area from the Ice Age to the 3rd millennium BC. There is some evidence that the area was inhabited since the Neolithic period. However, findings make it more likely that it was not used for settlement by Neolithic farmers but for gaining access to . There is just one grave dating to the middle Bronze Age (1600-1300 BC) but several graves nearby date to the late Bronze Age and some burial mounds (with wooden chambers) are from the early Iron Age. In several locations settlement remains contemporaneous to the necropolis (late Hallstatt period and early La T√®ne period) have been found in the area that later became the Heidengraben. The Heidengraben was likely created in the late La T√®ne period (late 2nd century BC to early 1st century BC). However, in the period of 250 to 150 BC the area seems to have been once again unpopulated. Archaeological findings indicate the presence of a simple agricultural population as well as specialized artisans (metal working, glass production). In addition, a large number of shards from Roman amphorae dating to 130 to 90 BC indicate that a significant amount of Roman wine was imported. This implies the existence of a rich elite that could afford these luxury items. No evidence of a burial site dating to the oppidum period has been discovered, but the earlier necropolis seems to have been used as a cult site and possibly for burial rituals. Why and exactly when the settlement was abandoned remains unclear. It appears that the inhabitants left it in the first half of the 1st century BC, but there is no indication of any reasons. This dating fits in with the abandonment of other oppida in that era, pointing to some fundamental changes in social, economic or political circumstances. Around 85 AD the Romans occupied the Swabian Jura and there were some farms or mansiones in the area. The Romans left c. 260 AD. The next signs of inhabitants date to the 7th century, when the area was settled by Alemanni. In the Middle Ages the area was only sparsely inhabited but some castles were constructed nearby like Hohenneuffen Castle (early 12th century) or Burg Hofen east of Grabenstein. The purpose of a medieval fortification surrounding 55 hectares to the north of Heidengraben (known as Bassgeige) is still unknown. It incorporates parts of a Celtic wall but was extended in late medieval times. Several similar structures nearby (Brucker Fels and Beurener Fels) also served an unknown purpose. Research The Heidengraben is mentioned as early as the 15th century as \\"Haidengraben\\". It was first the subject of scientific studies in the 19th century. It was identified as a pre-historic rampart by (1837-1907) in a sort of guide book published by Gustav Schwab Die Schw√§bische Alb mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Neckarseite in 1878. Initially, most observers attributed the structures as Roman in origin. (1865-1929) conducted excavations that identified the structure as late Iron Age, an oppidum in the sense used by Julius Caesar in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico. Hertlein also coined the name Elsachstadt based on the nearby source of the Elsach. Excavations at the burial site near the Burrenhof since the mid-19th century and in particular after 1983 have yielded significant numbers of findings, pointing to a use by some nearby settlement from the Urnfield period (after 1200 BC) to the late Hallstatt period (6th century BC). Valuable funerary goods indicate the presence of a social elite at that time. Some of the over 30 burial mounds have been recreated after having been removed by farming and excavation work. Although there were rescue excavations at several points in 1974, 1976 and 1981, the first systematic excavations of the Heidengraben itself took place only in 1994-99. These investigated just 1% of the area inside the inner wall and found evidence of widely spaced farm estates typical of oppida. The Heidengraben offered its residents a number of advantages: It was close to very fertile land, 800 hectares of which were actually inside the outer wall. There was plenty of fresh water nearby, a rarity in the uplands of the Swabian Jura due to its permeable geology. It was located close to important long distance trading routes, including the Danube and Neckar and the Albaufg√§nge (passes) connecting the two rivers. Immediately beneath Heidengraben was the Lenninger Tal offering access to Lake Constance (and later the site of a Roman road). The oppidum's inhabitants thus were well placed to profit from the trade flows passing through. In 1930, :de:Paul Reinecke equated the site with a Celtic town named Riusiava in the area of southern Germany by Ptolemy in his Geography. This was later supported by Rolf Nierhaus. However, no hard evidence has been discovered actually linking this oppidum with Riusiava. Similarly, theories that Heidengraben was the capital of the Tigurini are highly speculative. Today Much of the area is accessible to the public and there is an archaeological hiking trail called Achsnagelweg. In Grabenstetten, there is a museum (Keltenmuseum). Other findings can be viewed at the museum of the University of T√ºbingen. References Further reading * Ade, D. et.al., Der Heidengraben ‚Äì ein keltisches Oppidum auf der Schw√§bischen Alb (German).

Life Hoga was born into a Hasidic family in the Lublin area, then and for a few years in Poland. From Kuzmir (Kazimierz Dolny), he was the son of Yehuda Aryeh Leib, named Yehezkel;I.e. Ezekiel in English; variants are Yecheskel, Yecheschel, Ye·∏•ezkel, Chaskel etc. his father was the Rabbi there, and a follower of the Lublin Rebbe Jacob Isaac Hurwitz. After rabbinic education, support from Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski made it possible for him to study in Pu≈Çawy. He became an interpreter for Napoleon's forces in the period 1807 to 1809. After the war Hoga lived in Warsaw (then part of the Russian Empire). He acted from 1816 as assistant to the Jewish censor Adam Chalmelewski. He was himself appointed to the Jewish Censor Committee in 1818. After that he worked for Luigi Chiarini, of Warsaw University, and became his deputy. Under pressure to be baptised a Christian, he converted in the years after 1822, when he had begun to publish in Hebrew and on Jewish tradition. At this point he dropped his Jewish forename, in favour of the Christian name Stanislaus. By then he had left the Jewish censor post, and was engaged in Polish-Hebrew translation. Despite his apostate standing, Hoga defended Hasidism against state investigation in 1824. The authorities had been alarmed by an inquiry in 1823 into Hasidism in P≈Çock, and the Committee for Religious Affairs was asked for a report. Input to it from Jacob Tugenhold and Hoga helped the conclusions to tend to moderation, Tugenhold being another of the Jewish censorship personnel. On 3 August 1824 Hoga defended Hasidism in a public disputation. In Warsaw Hoga met Alexander McCaul of the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews (LSPCJ). With McCaul's encouragement he went to London, and by 1838 he participated in a translation into Hebrew of the New Testament. In later life Hoga took on literary work. He died ar 96 Charlotte Street, London, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. Views The Controversy of Zion (1844) was Hoga's intervention in the debate around the methods of the LSPCJ. His view was that Jews, as Christian converts, should retain the traditions of Jewish law. He expanded what he found in the writings of John Oxlee to the same effect, and allied himself with the views of Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna; similar sentiments went back to Joseph Priestley and Thomas Witherby. After a number of years the LSPCJ found his critical attitude unacceptable, and they parted company in 1849, by which time he was writing in a hostile fashion in periodicals. Moses Margoliouth then followed Hoga with public criticism of the LSPCJ and Anglicans. Works Hoga wrote: * Tu chazy czyli Rozmowa o ≈ªydach (1830), dialogue *Songs of Zion, a selection of English and German hymns translated into Hebrew (1834; 2d ed., with additions, 1842). * In Hebrew, ≈öefat Bri·π≠anya: A Grammar of the English Language for the Use of Hebrews (London, 1840), and The Controversy of Zion: a Meditation on Judaism and Christianity (1845). *In Hebrew translation, Pilgrim's Progress (London, 1844; 2d ed., 1851‚Äì52), and Alexander McCaul's Old Paths (1839).

Chiller has recently been involved in a controversial exchange of views with Nick Kyrgios. This has resulted in Kyrgios withdrawing from contention for the Olympics complaining of unfair treatment. Chiller continued her insistence upon discipline amongst current athletes, by banning Rio gold medallist Emma McKeon and fellow swimmer Josh Palmer from the Olympic closing ceremony after both breached team protocols. The ban on Emma McKeon was later revoked. In December 2017, Kitty Chiller was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Gymnastics Australia.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  History  =Founding= Immediately following the American Civil War, St. Matthias was founded as the \\"Freedmen's Church,\\" a separate congregation of recently emancipated enslaved people at Trinity Episcopal Church with the understanding that as soon as possible, it would be housed in a building of its own. Because the church was founded so close to the end of the Civil War, it considered to be one of the oldest, if not the oldest, African American Church in Asheville. According to the account of Thomas W. Patton, one of the founders of the church, the work of the Freedman's Church \\"started in Trinity Church, where each Sunday afternoon a crowd of Colored people were collected and drilled in the Catechism and other teachings of our church.\\" He continued stating that, \\"It is well remembered by some... how heartily the learners sang chants, hymns, responses, and repeated the Catechism Sunday after Sunday, much to the amusement, and perchance ridicule of some who thought themselves wise. The result has proven who were truly wise of those distant days.\\" The Freedmen's Church began meeting in a small structure near Trinity Episcopal Church that became known as Trinity Chapel. = Construction = As early as 1879 members of the Freedmen's congregation saw a need for a new building. It was several years later when construction on St. Matthias finally began. Although the architect of the church is unknown, the contractor for the project was James Vester Miller. Miller, himself born into slavery, was a member of Trinity Chapel and one of the most well respected brick masons and contractors in Asheville of his time. Miller is also responsible for the construction of Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Asheville, the Asheville Municipal Building, and many other projects across the state. Congregants gathered to lay the cornerstone of the building on February 22, 1894, two days before the Feast of St. Matthias. It was at this occasion that the present Bishop, Joseph B. Cheshire, bestowed the congregation with the name \\"St. Matthias\\" in honor of its new, independent status.

A range of crane models are offered by the company with model numbers reflecting the capacity of the crane pair and design variant. For example, the SB360 is the first generation design of Sidelifter cranes capable of lifting a maximum 36 tonne as a pair. Likewise the SB362 is a third generation design with the same maximum lift capacity.

An idea for organization of conference came in light of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of World War I. It is the first conference in this framework and organizers expressed their desire to continue it in future with Vienna and Paris mentioned as a potential next hosts after Berlin (so called Berlin Process). G√ºnther Oettinger confirmed at conference that event will be organised annually with Vienna as a host city in 2015 and Paris in 2016. The German chancellor announced intention to organize a conference on 7 June 2014. Invitation for participation was sent to all the countries of South Eastern Europe including Croatia and Slovenia that were already members of the European Union at the time of conference. The main intention was to show commitment for process of Future enlargement of the European Union, little progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia in that process and relations of Serbia with Russia in the light of International sanctions during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. During the Foreign Ministers‚Äô segment, Albanian Foreign Minister Bushati underlined the importance of making this initiative periodical, as well as finding the right instruments to enable, in future years, the drafting and implementation of concrete joint projects in the region. In this regard Albanian delegation presented a document under the title \\"Albanian Working Paper for the Western Balkans Conference in Berlin\\", which is based in the vision of \\"a region in peace and well prepared to join the European Union, by guarantying a dignified living for all its citizens.\\"http://www.punetejashtme.gov.al/en/press- office/news/minister-bushati-attends-western-balkans-summit-in-berlin&page;=1 At conference was announced future visit of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama to Serbia. It will be the first meeting of this type between two countries after 1947 meeting of Enver Hoxha with President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito. However, an incident during a football match in Belgrade has cast doubt on this visit. Edi Rama eventually visited Serbia on 10 November 2014 to meet his Serbian counterpart but tempers flared when Rama said that Kosovo's independence was \\"undeniable\\" and \\"must be respected\\" and Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic accused him of a \\"provocation\\". Franz Lothar Altmann, expert on the Balkans, stated in his pre-conference interview for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that conference proves increasing importance of Balkan region, especially with respect to Ukraine crisis. Regional activities before conference Prime ministers of Serbia Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and Deputy Chair of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Council of Ministers of Bosnia Zlatko Lagumd≈æija met in Belgrade on 20 August to agree on joint projects that two countries will present in Berlin. Serbian delegation also announced its intention seek support for infrastructure projectof modernization of the Belgrade‚ÄìBar railway. On 25 August 2014 Prime ministers of Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania meet prior to conference in Croatian town of Cavtat.

He was married to Jean, the sister of Sir Alfred Owen. Owen was proprietor of the BRM team from the early 1950s to 1974. Biography Stanley studied theology at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He worked as a journalist for Queen magazine and was a manager at The Dorchester Hotel in London. He attended the 1959 Monaco Grand Prix with his wife, and as a result became interested in motor racing. Alfred Owen did not attend Sunday races for religious reasons and Stanley and his wife became his representatives at meetings. After the 1960 Dutch Grand Prix, in which a spectator, in a prohibited area, died after Dan Gurney crashed his BRM, Stanley re-organised the team, easing disquiet felt by the drivers. His subsequent promotion of Tony Rudd proved a positive move as BRM secured the Constructors' Championship in 1962, together with the World Drivers' Championship for Graham Hill. This however, proved a high point in the team's existence and it could not compete with the Cosworth-powered cars of the later 1960s and '70s. In the 1970s, the team competed as Stanley-BRM, after the Owen Organisation withdrew its support, but despite arranging innovative sponsorship deals with Marlboro and Yardley, Stanley could not arrest the team's decline. Stanley was instrumental in establishing the Formula One mobile medical unit which for the first time provided good standard medical facilities at circuits. When Jackie Stewart was injured, driving for BRM, in 1966, both he and Stanley were unimpressed with the medical help available at the circuit. Stanley became a strong ally of Stewart in his campaign to improve safety and created the International Grand Prix Medical Service in 1967. Stanley himself funded the mobile medical unit, which was made available to GP circuits in Europe. After Jo Siffert was killed whilst driving for BRM at Brands Hatch in 1971, Stanley personally tested fireproof suits and oversaw the training of fire marshalls. Stanley was honorary secretary and treasurer of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association in its original form and was also a prolific author. Personal life Stanley was married twice; firstly, to Kate Furness (two sons) from whom he was divorced in 1949. In 1955 he married Jean Baber (n√©e Owen) who had four children from her previous marriage. Jean Stanley died in June 2002. Stanley died on 8 January 2004, aged 92, at Trumpington, Cambridgeshire following a stroke.

Life  Enzo Osella was born in Volpiano, near Turin, to Luigi and Maria Osella. His parents ran a grocery store and a transport company in Volpiano until the end of the Second World War. After the war Luigi Osella took over a garage in the centre of Turin. Enzo Osella first job out of school was in a gravel plant. He then started helping his father at the garage by working on the customers' cars. One of his father's regular client was an amateur rally driver who convinced Enzo to assist him as navigator. From 1957 Osella competed as navigator in several rally races, including the Sestriere Rally. Osella even attempted to participate as a driver by borrowing his sister's Fiat 600. He then purchased a Lotus 11, which he modified according to his own wishes and equipped with an Osca engine and an Alfa Romeo differential, and took part in hillclimb races. His racing efforts not particularly successful, Osella in 1963 took a job with Carlo Abarth, who produced Fiat-based racing cars in Turin and also ran a motorsport team. Osella worked for Abarth as a test driver, gaining insight into chassis and engine production and tuning aspects. Osella also worked as a mechanic and driver supervisor for the Abarth racing team during this time. At the end of 1964 Enzo Osella went into business for himself and took over an Abarth factory agency in Turin. In 1971 Carlo Abarth sold the name rights and production facilities to Fiat and retired to Vienna. Osella purchased the racing department, and started operating it under the name Osella Corse. Osella's company is currently based in Verolengo. The team is still competing in sportcar and hillclimb races.  Personal life  Enzo Osella is married and has two children, a boy and a girl.

Not to be confused with the other Don Nichols who kidnapped Kari Swenson who was released from prison 23 August 2017. Biography Nichols, a U.S. Army combat veteran of World War II and Korea who then served in Military Intelligence, later found success as an entrepreneur in Japan before returning to the U.S. and setting up his own company called Advanced Vehicle Systems in 1968. In 1970 he raced his first CanAm car. He decided to call it Shadow, with the team's logo featuring a cloaked spy. Jackie Oliver won the CanAm title for Shadow in 1974. With major sponsorship from Universal Oil Products, Nichols expanded his operation and entered F1 at the start of 1973 with Oliver and George Follmer driving. In 1975 Oliver became the team's commercial director, but the original sponsor pulled out and could not be adequately replaced. In 1977 most of the team management walked out of Shadow to join the Arrows team. Nichols sued and won, claiming copyright infringement, and that year Alan Jones scored Shadow's single Grand Prix victory. Shadow was in financial decline, however, and in 1981 Nichols sold his assets to the Theodore team of Chinese businessman Teddy Yip. He died at the age of 92 on August 21, 2017.

It is notable for its well-preserved 19th-century buildings, and for its relatively uncommon shape, born out of the area's origin as a major road junction. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history In 1722, the legislature of the Province of New Hampshire ordered the construction of a road between Dover and the Lakes Region west of Lake Winnipesaukee. Alton's downtown Main Street follows the route of that road. The Wolfeboro Road was also an 18th-century road, built to provide access to Wolfeboro on the east side of the lake. These two roads met at an acute angle, which developed in the 19th century to become Alton's town center. Early development took place south of this junction, but the area became important in 1830 with the construction of the Cocheco Hotel, which stands at the northern end of the district. The advent of railroad service to the village brought further changes, including the rerouting of the Wolfeboro Road away to the north. The town, however, decided in 1893 to build its Romanesque town hall on the east side of the former Wolfeboro Road alignment, and subsequent development has included the construction of the Colonial Revival Gilman Museum. The district is bounded on the north by the former Cocheco Hotel (now housing other businesses) and Factory Street (New Hampshire Route 140), and is bounded on the south by Depot and Church Streets. The triangular \\"square\\" is mostly paved, with small triangular grassy areas on which monuments to the town's military service members are located. There are eleven buildings in the district, most of which face toward the square. In addition to the town hall, hotel, and museum, there are a few residences and three commercial buildings. The Greek Revival White Lodge, built in the 1850s, is one of Alton's finest period residences.

Declara's online social learning platform learns how users interact through the use of semantic search, machine learning algorithms, and recommendations to deliver personalized suggestions on potential collaborators and resources for projects.  Product  The core of Declara's technology is its platform, called the CognitiveGraph, which analyses and observes how users interact with data ‚Äî including searches, Tweets, posts, blogs, videos, likes, recommendations, messages, and web content ‚Äî to create a personalized, cognitive learning map based on a user's data, history, and interests. Declara's customers include governments, companies, educational institutions, non-profits and research organizations that use its platform to connect everyone in a company or organization to collaborate, learn, and solve problems more effectively.  History  Declara was founded in 2012 by Ramona Pierson and Nelson Gonzalez. The inspiration for Declara, Pierson has said, came from her recovery from a 1984 car accident that tore apart her body and put her in a coma for 18 months. When Pierson awoke, she was blind and was forced to relearn how to walk, breathe, and even smile. She regained partial sight in her left eye after a successful corneal transplant operation. The process of having to relearn such basic skills for her highlighted the importance of being a lifelong learner, which ultimately led to her co- founding Declara. Nelson and Pierson started a company that has been described as building a software simulation of Pierson's mind. With the help of algorithms developed by Pierson and others, including engineers from Google and Microsoft, Declara's system learns how people interact, what types of questions they're looking to answer, and who can provide the best answers. Declara secured $5 million in early investments, which included the backing of Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal. In April 2014, Declara raised $16 million in Series A funding, led by GSV Capital, with participation from Data Collective, Founders Fund, and Catamount Ventures. In June 2014, the company secured $9 million in funding from Linden Venture Fund and EDBI, bringing its total Series A funding to $25 million. At the same time, Declara announced its expansion into Singapore. Customers Education Services Australia (ESA), a national, not-for-profit company owned by Australian education ministers, began using the Declara platform in 2013. In April 2014, Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educati√≥n (SNTE), the largest teachers' union in Mexico and Latin America, selected Declara as the technology platform for professional development of its 1.6 million teachers and administrators. Declara's customers include Genentech and The University of Pennsylvania in the United States; B√©calos, an organization of Mexico's Televisa Foundation; and Tu clase, tu pa√≠s in Chile.

Description and history The Washington Mooney House stands in central New Hampton, on the north side of New Hampshire Route 104, just east of the northbound I-93 onramp. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical arrangement. The main entrance is at the center, with an entrance surround of sidelight windows flanked on both sides by narrow pilasters, and a projecting cornice above. The interior follows a fairly typical central chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule that has a winding staircase in front of the chimney, parlor spaces on either side, and the kitchen extending across most of the rear. The interior retains original floorboards, wainscoting, and interior window shutters, and includes paneled fireplace surrounds in the parlors. Its builder is unknown; the house and associated farm property were probably purchased by Washington Mooney around the time of his 1831 marriage. Despite adaptive reuse of the property in the 20th century for office space, and a succession of owners, the basic fabric of the building has remained little altered. The building is locally distinctive for its particularly fine entrance surround and central hall.

Between June 1974 and August 1975 she raced six times, winning twice. As a two-year-old she won on her debut before being narrowly beaten in the Prix Robert Papin before recording an emphatic six-length success in the Prix Morny. Although she did not race again in 1974 she was the highest-rated juvenile filly of the season in both the official French Handicap and the independent Timeform ratings. After running third when favourite for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches on her three-year-old debut she ran poorly in two subsequent races and was retired from racing. She was not a success a broodmare. Background Broadway Dancer was a small bay mare with a white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Kentucky by the Nickols Brothers. She was one of many important winners sired by the Canadian- bred Northern Dancer, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1964 before becoming one of the most successful breeding stallions in Thoroughbred history. Broadway Dancer's dam Broadway Melody, was a high-class racemare who finished second in the Queen Mary Stakes in 1966 and the Jersey Stakes in the following year. Broadway Melody was a half-sister to the dam of the King's Stand Stakes winner African Song and a distant relative of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Marienbard. The filly was acquired by Daniel Wildenstein and was sent to France to be trained by the Argentinian Angel Penna Sr.. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Broadway Dancer made a successful racecourse debut at Chantilly Racecourse in June when she was an impressive winner of maiden race over 1100 metres. She was then moved up sharply in class and matched against colts in the Group One Prix Robert Papin over the same distance at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 28 July. Ridden by Yves Saint- Martin she started at odds of 7/2 and finished second, beaten a neck by the colt Sky Commander. On 18 August, at Deauville Racecourse, faced Sky Commander again in the Prix Morny. Partnered again by Saint-Martin she started the 4.7/1 second favourite behind the Prix Yacowlef winner Free Round, Broadway Dancer was restrained in the early stages before drawing alongside the leaders 200 metres from the finish, before accelerating away from her rival and winning by six lengths from Princesse Lee. Broadway Dancer did not race again in 1974. =1975: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Broadway Dancer started the 4/5 favourite for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 May. Racing for the first time in eight months, she finished third of the ten runners behind Ivanjica and Nobiliary. Three weeks later, the filly was moved up in distance for the Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres at the same course. She again started favourite but finished eighth of the twelve runners behind Nobiliary. Broadway Dancer was brought back in distance for the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville on 3 August. Ridden by the Italian Gianfranco Dettori she finished unplaced behind Sky Commander. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1974: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the official French Handicap, Broadway Dancer was rated the best two-year-old filly of 1974, two pounds behind the leading colt Mariacci and five pounds ahead of the next-best filly Delmora. The independent Timeform organisation awarded Broadway Dancer a rating of 131, the highest given to any juvenile filly in 1974, but named Cry of Truth (rated 129) as their best two-year-old filly. In their annual Racehorses of 1974, Timeform stated that Broadway Dancer was \\"likely to prove exceptional\\". In the official French Handicap for 1975, Broadway Dancer was rated fifteen pounds behind the leading three-year-old filly Ivanjica. Breeding record Broadway Dancer became a broodmare for Wildenstein's breeding operations. She produced several foals between 1977 and 1990 but only one minor winner. *Behave (filly, foaled 1977, sired by Brigadier Gerard) failed to win in two races *Bombshell (bay filly, 1979, by Ashmore), failed to win in five races *Bal Royal (bay colt, 1980 by Arctic Tern), won two races *Bonnys Niece (filly, 1982, by Great Nephew) *Belle Bleue (filly, 1988, by Blazing Saddles), failed to win in seven races Pedigree References Category:1972 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 12-g ","title":"Broadway Dancer"},{"id":"43672676","title":"Soviet submarine L-22"},{"id":"43672699","title":"List of indoor arenas in Slovenia"},{"id":"43672721","text":"Hafiz Baxish (full name: Hafiz Habib oghlu Baxishov) (1932‚Äì1989) was an Azerbaijani poet.

Crane (Meg Crane) is an American inventor and graphic designer who lives in New York. Crane created the first at home pregnancy test in 1967 while working at Organon in West Orange, New Jersey. She is the listed inventor on US Patent 3,579,306 and 215,7774. There was resistance to marketing pregnancy tests for consumers rather than doctors, and the home pregnancy test did not become available until 1977, except for a market test in Canada in 1972. She was also a juror in the 2004 trial of Martha Stewart for lying to federal investigators during an insider trading investigation. Career Margaret Crane, 26, was hired by Organon Pharmaceuticals in 1967 to work on a new cosmetic line for the company. One day as she was touring the laboratory of the company she noticed many test tubes. Curious to what they were, she asked and to her surprise they were pregnancy tests. Each individual test tube contained reagents that when mixed with a pregnant woman's urine would indicate pregnancy by displaying a red ring at the bottom of the test tube. Inspired by this, Margaret Crane saw the possibility of this as a home pregnancy test. She thought it was easy enough to do that women could perform this test at home and in a quicker fashion. Crane had no previous background in science, however, she saw making the pregnancy test an at-home and private experience was important and necessary. This inspired her to create her first model for the test, similar to the tests she observed in her lab. The model Crane proposed was sold across the nation in 1977. Crane and her partner Ira Sturtevant, who aided Crane in her endeavors, went on to develop an advertisement and design firm called Ponzi & Weill. = Invention = She took matters into her own hands and went to her home in New York to begin working on her prototype. She combined a paper clip holder, a test tube, a mirror, and a dropper. She put her invention together and presented it to Organon but the idea was at first rejected, but they applied for patents in her name in 1969.https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/history-home- pregnancy-test/396077/ When Crane presented her idea, it was met with major pushback. Crane's proposition made the lab hesitant due to worries that the lab would lose business to doctors if women started performing these tests at home. Organon eventually decided to do a test market of the product and Margaret Crane's design was chosen. Organon hired a New York ad agency to do the marketing, and Ira Sturtevant was to head the account. He took a particular interest in Margret Crane's prototype. He was intrigued by how elegantly the home pregnancy kit was put together. Organon chose Canada for the test market and Ms. Crane and Mr. Sturtevant were chosen to head the project. They went on to become partners for more than 40 years until his passing in 2008. With success the pair went on to building their own marketing company named Ponzi and Weill. This advertising business partnership became an important role in the promotion of the pregnancy test. ‚ÄúEvery woman has the right to know whether or not she is pregnant,‚Äù said an early ad for the test that women ‚Äúcan do by yourself, at home, in private, in minutes.‚Äù This was Margaret Crane's biggest motivator to invent the at home pregnancy kit. Before Crane‚Äôs proposed invention, women would have to go to a doctor and have their urine tested in a lab to determine if they were pregnant. As a result, women would have to wait weeks for results. In the 1960s, when Crane‚Äôs idea first came to be, a pregnancy test was processed in a lab by monitoring levels of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. It was discovered that women secrete high levels of hCG when pregnant. Therefore, if hCG was detected it indicated pregnancy. Due to the food and drug administration rules for medical devices it took a while to receive approval for her prototype in the Unites States. The pregnancy test developed by Crane did not receive FDA approval until 1976. Soon after, Crane‚Äôs pregnancy test hit the market in 1977, ten year since she had first proposed her idea. It was marketed as ‚ÄúThe Predictor‚Äù. Although her name was on the patents for the device, Organon licensed the product to three over-the-counter pharmaceutical companies and Crane never received a penny for her design. She had to sign off her rights for a dollar and never saw that dollar. But she was grateful to have met her partner in the process. It was not until 2012 when the New York Times ran a short \\"who Made It\\" feature and Crane received proper recognition for her prototype that simplified the pregnancy of many women.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/unknown-designer- first-home-pregnancy-test-getting-her-due-180956684/ Crane was reading the paper one morning and noticed that the column was about the history of pregnancy test. Her name was not included in the article, and she knew she had to speak up about her contribution in order to receive recognition. Crane was hesitant to come forward because the article was discussing the modern version of the pregnancy test, which Crane did not create. However, since Crane‚Äôs ideas sparked the change in pregnancy tests with her prototype evolving into what is on shelves today, she stepped forward and emailed the author of the article. Since 2012, Crane has received recognition for her invention.

His work, produced primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, falls into three categories: photographs, audio tapes, and videotapes. Hurles' models were typically ex-cons, hustlers, drifters, and lowlifes. Early years In the 1960s, Hurles appeared in movies and magazines, with Guild Press, Washington D.C., for whom he was also a photographer. In 1975, already filming in Super-8 format used by his mentor and longtime friend Bob Mizer of Athletic Model Guild, he met and became a great friend of Jack Fritscher, editor of Drummer magazine, who described David as \\"my longtime pal and housemate\\". The character Solly Blue in Fritscher's novel Some Dance to Remember has much in common with Hurles., but while they share \\"archetypal coincidental adventures\\", Fritscher has denied that Blue is based on Hurles. Hurles has written of San Francisco at the time: \\"Perhaps you had to be there...the 70's, San Francisco, the blossoming and peak of the gay sexual culture. It was a rare time; everything, it seemed, was perfect. So perfect, in fact, that those of us there could not have possibly imagined it might ever be otherwise!\\" Jim Stewart describes his encounter with Hurles, the neighborhood they both lived in, and the birth of the name Old Reliable in the first chapter of his Folsom Street Blues. His first published pictures appeared in Drummer, 21 (January 1978); no other magazine would touch them. He also shot many covers and centerfolds for Fritscher's zine Man2Man Quarterly (1980-1982), whose mailing address was Hurles' San Francisco apartment. Subsequently, Hurles' photos have appeared in dozens of gay magazines. He moved to Los Angeles shortly. Old Reliable In 1990, Hurles issued a catalog of his Old Reliable material, a guide to nearly 500 men and the hundreds of original Old Reliable Video Tapes, as well as the audio cassettes and photos in which the men appear (56 pp.). In 1995, a second volume was published, taking up where the first one left off, also \\"a guide to nearly 500 men\\" (64 pp.). Models were recruited among ex-convicts and addicts. As put by admirer John Waters, \\"David likes psychos. Nude ones. Money-hungry drug addicts with big dicks. Rage-filled robbers without rubbers. And of course, convicts.\\" Many of them were dangerous‚Äîhe wanted them to be, that was a key part of their attractiveness for himJack Fritscher, \\"Call Him 'Old Reliable' Because He Is\\", 1981, http://www.jackfritscher.com/Drummer/Virtual/Old%20Reliable.html#Feature article, retrieved 2014-09-02‚Äîbut part of David's skill, which no one since has duplicated, was being able to manage them so that they would perform as instructed and not attack him. However, Hurles also said: \\"There have been several thousand models. When they are not in prison, or very married, it has been my practice to stay in touch with many of them, often over decades. They are my friends.\\"\\"Old Reliable's Prince Charming Might be on Death Row\\", Box Magazine, issue 6.2, reproduced in http://oldreliablefund.blogspot.com/2009/04/old-reliables-prince-charming- might-be.html , retrieved 2014-08-17 On another occasion he said that one of the hardest parts of his job was not getting caught up in the miserable lives of his models. Although he did not publicize it, sometimes Hurles' models were more mainstream gay pornographic actors. Scott O'Hara made a tape for him, as did Peter O'Brien.Ohara, Autopornography: A Memoir of Life in the Lust Lane, Binghamton, New York: Haworth Press, 1997, , p. 109. =Photographs= Hurles chose to downplay technical fireworks with his camera in order to focus on the emotional pyrotechnics of his models.Rex, quoted by John Calendo, \\"Jailbirds and Drifters: The Men of Old Reliable\\" http://www.nightcharm.com/2010/10/17/jailbirds-and-drifters-the-men-of-old- reliable/#.U-6BafldXwj, retrieved 2014-08-15 His models, picked up on the street or sent to him by referral, would come to his apartment, get naked, and masturbate. Usually they were shot solo, and with an erection; the amount paid depended on \\"the size of your dick and whether you could get it up in front of the camera.\\" They were distinguished by \\"attitude\\" - straight, in your face, angry, contemptuous of fags, dangerous, smoking cigars, giving the finger, flexing their biceps. \\"Rough trade is too tame a word\\", was the description of John Calendo.John Calendo, \\"Jailbirds and Drifters: The Men of Old Reliable\\" http://www.nightcharm.com/2010/10/17/jailbirds-and-drifters-the-men-of-old- reliable/#.U-6BafldXwj, retrieved 2014-08-15 Getting robbed by his models, or having his equipment stolen, he viewed as part of the cost of doing business. His photographs may most easily be consulted in two collections: Speeding, in black and white, then in color Outcast,Green Candy Press, 2010, and to a lesser extent in The Big Penis Book.Ed. Dian Hanson, Taschen America, 2008, Hurles printed his pictures in his own darkroom, and filled all orders single- handedly. 834 of Hurles' photos are reproduced on tribe.net.http://tribes.tribe.net/oldreliablemodels?current=tribephotos&set;=y#tabs, retrieved 2014-08-17 A large number are posted on vintageoldreliable.blogspot.com and also in the Yahoo!

Hurles' pictures are used, with permission, as illustrations in two collections of Boyd McDonald's Straight to Hell: The New York Review of Cocksucking material: MeatMeat: how men look, act, walk, talk, dress, undress, taste & smell: True homosexual experiences from S.T.H. writers, introduction by Charles Shively, with blurbs by Gore Vidal, William S.

Boyd McDonald, introduction by Harold Norse, Bright Tyger Press, 1988, Hurles described McDonald as \\"the kindest person,\\" who \\"gave me such encouragement.\\" =Audio tapes (cassettes)= Besides paying for modeling, Hurles paid many of his models to talk, while alone in a room with the door closed, into an ordinary cassette recorder, typically on how they would like to mistreat fags. In many cases he would go on to record a second audio tape in which he sexually serviced the models. Behind the bravado and aggression of the models there sometimes come through haunting overtones of the fact that they are losers in life and they know it. There also comes through, at times, their bewildered, demasculinized admiration of Hurles' enthusiasm for sex, for being the bottom, paying to give them fellatio, paying them to masturbate, buying their (gay sex) orgasms, which feel disturbingly good, although they see themselves as straight. Other models, however, are not threatened at all; they find it enjoyable to exploit Hurles for cash and sex, and \\"a hole's a hole\\". Some of the models were openly bisexual or gay, but David preferred straight models. He released over four hundred of these tapes of verbal sexual abuse. He has \\"always felt his audiotapes were his finest achievement.\\"Dian Hanson, \\"Treasures from the OR Storage Unit,\\" http://oldreliablefund.blogspot.com/search?updated- max=2009-10-06T19:02:00-07:00 Five CDs of selected recordings have been released by Bijou Video.http://www.bijouworld.com/search.html?searchword=reliable, retrieved 2014-08-17 =Videotapes= With the arrival of home video recording equipment around 1980, David began creating videotapes, eventually releasing over 300 of them.

As World War II broke out, Stavsky relinquished his posts and, as a war correspondent for Pravda newspaper, went first to Mongolia then to the Winter War (where he was severely injured) and finally to the Western front where in 1943 he was killed in combat. Biography Vladimir Petrovich Kirpichnikov was born in Penza, to a family of a cabinet-maker. After his mother's death in 1915, he went to work, in 1918 joined the Red Army and soon became a commander of a fighting unit engaged in the suppression of numerous anti-Bolshevik mutinies. In 1918 Kirpichnikov, now an RKP(B) member, was transferred to the Caucasian Front's First Army's HQ, joined the local military section of Cheka, and by the end of the Civil War had been a brigade commissar. After demobilization in 1922, Kirpichnikov started his journalistic and literary career, starting out as a Rostov-on-Don- based Molot newspaper author. Three years later, now a secretary of the Northern Caucasian Association of Proletarian Writers (–°–ö–ê–ü–ü), and the Communist Party official superintending the stocking up of wheat harvest in Kuban, he joined Na Podyome (On the Rise) magazine as its editor-in-chief. In 1928 he moved to Moscow to become the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers secretary. Writing under the pseudonym Stavsky, Kirpichnikov published several short novels, a book of short stories and numerous documentary sketches, highlighting collectivization, calling for ruthlessness in the class war and singing paeans to Stalin's internal politics.Writers of Moscow, the Great Patriotic War Fighters. Moscow, 1997// . –ü–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã ‚Äì —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã. ‚Äì Moscow, 1997. ‚Äì Pp. 401‚Äî402 In 1932, under the guidance of the CPSU Central Committee, Stavsky took active part in the formation of the Soviet Union of Writers, of which he became the General Secretary in 1936, after Maxim Gorky's death. As such, Stavsky sanctioned the prosecution and subsequent killing of many prominent literary figures. Boris Pasternak, who survived, was one of his first targets. Pasternak crossed Stavsky by refusing to sign an Open Letter calling for death sentences for Grigori Zinoviev and the other defendants at the show trial of August 1936. Stavsky forged Pasternak's signature on the letter, and delivered a long complaint against Pasternak at a writers' meeting in December. Mikhail Sholokhov might have been the victim of his overzealousness too: after paying a visit to the And Quiet Flows the Don author on 16 September 1937, Stavsky wrote a personal report to Stalin, accusing the latter of being 'politically misguided'. In his 1938 letter to the NKVD narkom Nikolai Yezhov, Stavsky demanded to \\"resolve the question of Mandelshtam,\\" labeling the latter's poetry as 'obscene and libelous'. Soon after that, the poet was arrested and sentenced to five years of hard labour. In the same letter Stavsky condemned Valentin Katayev and Iosif Prut for \\"defending Mandelshtam violently.\\" during 1938, he kept a private diary, in which he recorded his growing fear for his own future. In August, he told a fellow bureaucrat, Pyotr Pospelov \\"Sooner or later it will all be clear who it was that wanted to do me in, a good Stalinist and Bolshevik.\\" As World War II broke out, Stavsky relinquished his posts and, as a war correspondent, went first to Mongolia then to the Finnish War (where he was heavily injured), the Western and the Kalinin Fronts. Stavsky, the only Soviet author to have received two Orders of the Red Banner before 1941, was lauded for bravery by colleagues. In November 1943, accompanying the Red Army sniper Klavdia Ivanova, he entered the neutral zone nearby Nevel in Pskov region, where he was killed. Vladimir Petrovich Stavsky is interred in Velikiye Luki, where one of the streets bears his name.

It was originally released on September 30, 2014, on the Turnstile Music record label. Background In March 2014, Owens shared the track, \\"It Comes Back to You\\", writing that the song was \\"from a new album I've made with dear friends\\". Then in May, Owens followed this up with \\"Stephen\\", saying, \\"I think it's a song unlike anything I've ever worked on.\\" In July, Owens shared the album cover and track listing plus a video for the single, \\"Nothing More Than Everything To Me\\", directed by Max Minghella, announcing that A New Testament would be released at the end of September accompanied by a North America and UK tour. In a statement accompanying this announcement, Owens wrote that A New Testament was \\"inspired by the fundamentals of American music‚ÄîGospel, Country, R&B;,\\" and was a demonstration of \\"honest, earnest, simple songwriting‚Äî'three chords and the truth'\\". He also shared that he worked on the album with many of the musicians from Girls' Father, Son, Holy Ghost (2011), including guitarist John Anderson, drummer Darren Weiss and keyboardist Danny Eisenberg, and Lysandre producer Doug Boehm. In an interview with Pitchfork in July, Owens shared that A New Testament was strongly influenced by the music he grew up with: the simple, country-influenced guitar music he played in the Children of God, and the AM radio he heard while working for the late Stanley Marsh 3 in Amarillo, Texas. Owens also commented on the more \\"lighthearted\\" nature of A New Testament, saying that he is \\"happy. And if some of that came out on the record, that's good. I don't want to be afraid to show that. People like me for being this down-and-out character, but I‚Äôm sorry, I'm not your Jesus. Don't hand me that cross. I refuse to play along.\\" Owens attributed his relative contentment to the stable, long-term relationship he is in with Dominant Legs singer Hannah Hunt, and the improved relationship with his estranged father, who he refers to in the song \\"Stephen\\". In August, Owens performed acoustic renditions of \\"I Just Can‚Äôt Live Without You (But I'm Still Alive)\\", \\"Nothing More Than Everything To Me\\" and the unreleased \\"Brian Deneke\\" (named for the 19-year-old punk musician of the same name, who was killed in a deliberate hit-and-run attack in 1997) in London. In the middle of September, Owens released the cowboy-themed music video for \\"Never Wanna See That Look Again\\", directed by Aaron Brown. A week ahead of its release, A New Testament started streaming in full via Pitchfork Advance. Notably, a few songs on A New Testament originated from Owen's time in Girls: \\"Overcoming Me\\" was first written in January 2008, \\"Stephen\\" around 2010, while \\"Oh My Love\\" first premiered in July 2010. Owens commented on this, saying, \\"For me, the songs are good when they preserve a moment that I can always go back to. They serve as a little porthole to that very strong, real memory I had when I wrote it and I like that.\\" In addition, despite the album's forays into gospel music, the opening number \\"My Trouble Heart\\" re-writes Peter, Paul and Mary's 1962 song \\"Early in the Morning\\" from a godless perspective. \\"I‚Äôm a very firm atheist. I never have believed in god,\\" Owens states. Critical reception A New Testament received generally favourable reviews from critics: At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 20 reviews. The Guardian's Tim Jonze called A New Testament \\"a gospel-tinged country record\\", writing that while \\"the melodies here don‚Äôt reflect [Owen's] best work\\", \\"there‚Äôs a passion and honesty here, an uncompromising desire to follow his own vision.\\" Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote, \\"A New Testament is not tormented. Neither is it explicitly a new-morning, season-of-renewal record. It‚Äôs just a different kind of guilelessness, one that uses Hammond organ and steel guitar, and consequently leans toward country and gospel and a certain kind of settled, adult pop more than garage-punk and psychedelia.\\" Track listing  Personnel  Credits adapted from AllMusic. *Christopher Owens ‚Äì design, guitar, keyboards, mixing, percussion, producer, vibraphone, vocals *John Anderson ‚Äì guitar *Doug Boehm ‚Äì engineer, mixing, producer *Dave Cooley ‚Äì mastering *Eddie Efira ‚Äì pedal steel *Danny Eisenberg ‚Äì Hammond B3, piano, wurlitzer *Makeda Francisco ‚Äì background vocals *Jared Hirshland ‚Äì assistant *Hannah Hunt ‚Äì design *Skyler Jordan ‚Äì background vocals *Traci Nelson ‚Äì background vocals *Morgan Stratton ‚Äì assistant *David Sutton ‚Äì bass guitar *Annie Thornton ‚Äì cover photo, inside photo *Darren Weiss ‚Äì drums *Terry Yerves ‚Äì assistant References External links *Official website *Turnstile Music Category:2014 albums Category:Christopher Owens albums Category:Alternative country albums by American artists ","title":"A New Testament (Christopher Owens album)"},{"id":"43672808","text":"R≈´dolfs SauleLatvijas UniversitƒÅtes AkadƒìmiskƒÅ bibliotƒìka (27 January 1903, Vidzeme ‚Äì 16 March 1975, Chicago) was a Latvian performer, professional actor, ballet master and artist. He performed widely for the Latvian National Ballet, as a part of their core team during the late 1920s and 1930s, under Osvalds Lemanis. Saule was renowned for his role in the commedia dell'arte performance of Scaramouche.  Biography  He was born and raised near Cƒìsis in the former Government of Livland. His father, JƒÅnis Saule, died in a car crash, and his mother, Kristƒ´ne died in his youth, and Saule moved to Riga soon thereafter. During the Latvian War of Independence Saule served in the Latvian Army, and moved to Riga, following the end of World War I. R≈´dolfs Saule performed for the Latvian National Ballet. Herein, he studied under great Russians artists and performers whom had inspired Osvalds Lemanis. The idea of establishing a permanent ballet troupe came in 1922 when St. Petersburg Marinsky Theater ballet teacher and director Nikolai Sergeyev began instructing dancers, who gathered in Riga. Saule was perhaps, most renown for his role in the Italian comedy, Scaramouche, performing in 1923.http://www.artoflatvia.lv/darbi/752 Saulƒì is also known for his roles in the Latvian interpretations of Don Quixote, Cavalier of Roses, the cardinal in Esmeralda, Se√±or of Bolero and \\"Cavalier Henry\\" in The Last Dream, among a handful of others. During the World War II, Saule was sent to Germany, where he was initially marked for heavy labor in a German Bosch military industrial complex devoted to replacement parts for tanks and tracked vehicles, approximately 90 km south of Berlin. Upon realization, among the German High Command, that this particular group were professional performers, the prisoners were assigned the task or role of entertainment, while confined by the Wehrmacht. After combat hostilities ceased, the group made their way through Bavaria to Salzburg. During this time, Saule and his peers performed for Allied Commanders (i.e. HQ British Army of the Rhine, July 1948) across Southern Germany and Austria, as they marched onward to secure emigration status to the United States. The Latvian Ballet, at this point, a \\"traveling\\" performance group, performed for the US Third Army in M√ºnchen (Munich) on June 8, 1947 and in Stuttgart, Saule performed the role of \\"Lieutenant Raymond\\" on November 19, 1946. R≈´dolfs Saule moved to Oak Park, Illinois in the early 1950s. He spent his latter years in the presence of asbestos, as he applied sheet rock and dry wall in his newly-found occupation as an internal carpenter and transfer warehouse worker.ChicagoAmerican, November 28, 1957 R≈´dolfs Saule died in 1975 from leukemia, having spent his days in the presence of asbestos, as he applied sheet rock and dry wall as an internal carpenter.ChicagoAmerican, November 28, 1957 He was survived by his wife Dzidra Sandra Saule (n√©e Erikson) and their three children.

It was ranked the 80th best Brazilian album of all time by the Brazilian Rolling Stone magazine. Considered one of the most representative records of the countercultural Tropic√°lia movement, the album features songwriting by various artist associated with the movement, with whom Costa had previously worked with in the 1968 collaboration album Tropic√°lia: ou Panis et Circencis. These include Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Torquato Neto. Composition The music in the album has been considered unprecedented. It represents a strong departure from the style of Domingo, her debut album recorded with Caetano Veloso, which featured a \\"set of airy, somewhat standard bossa nova tunes\\". Writing for Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone, Marcus Petro considered that, despite incorporating new influences from Janis Joplin and James Brown, Costa's music still retained strong bossa nova elements.

It was built from 1926 to 1929, and is a Tudor Revival and Late Gothic Revival style building consisting of two stacked blocks. The lower block is a rectangular slab with rounded corners; it is capped by the second block, a two-tier set-back story. The steel frame and reinforced concrete building was designed to serve as a base for an unbuilt skyscraper. It features a roof deck with a bronze semi- elliptical balcony, molded terra cotta pilasters, and a ziggurat-like arrangement of huge ramps to the roof deck. The building occupies a full city block and housed one of America's first indoor shopping malls. It was sold to the federal government in 1943. The building housed the National Climatic Data Center until 1995. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 1997, the City of Asheville acquired the titled to the building under the National Monument Act. The city then signed a 198-year lease with the Grove Arcade Public Market Foundation, a group founded to preserve the building's structural and historical integrity. Over the next five years, the building would be restored and reopened to the public in 2002.

He is the co-founder and managing director of BlueCrest Capital Management, Europe's third-largest hedge-fund firm which he co-founded in 2000. He is Britain's wealthiest hedge fund manager according to the Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated wealth of ¬£4.859 billion. Early life and education Platt was born in Preston, Lancashire, England in 1968. His father taught civil engineering at the University of Manchester. His mother was a university administrator. His grandmother, whom he has described as \\"a serious equity trader,\\" introduced him to investment. She \\"helped him buy stock in trust savings banks that were selling shares to the public.\\" At 14, he invested ¬£500 in a shipping line, Common Brothers, that soon tripled in price. Some of his first investments were in Britain's newly privatised utilities. He studied Civil Engineering at Imperial College London. After a year, he switched to Mathematics and Economics at the London School of Economics, from which he graduated in 1991. Investment career =Early career= Platt started in the after his grandmother gave him some shares in which to invest and he discovered he had a talent for investing. He joined JP Morgan in 1991. Platt assumed responsibility for developing JP Morgan's swaps and options trading business in April 1992, and in April 1996, became the head of trading for all swaps products relating to the 11 founding nations of the European single currency. In 2000 Platt co-founded BlueCrest Capital Management LLP, with William Reeves. =BlueCrest Capital= Discerning in August 2007 that ‚Äúa stock market crash lay ahead,‚Äù Platt ‚Äúsold his bank shares, and bought ‚Äòsafe‚Äô sovereign bonds,‚Äù and thus ‚Äúavoided the worst of the financial crisis, and profited from the resulting 'flight to quality' and plunge in interest rates.‚Äù As of 2014, BlueCrest was Europe's fourth largest hedge fund. In that year, it managed over ¬£30 billion and employed 350 people. BlueCrest initially focused on trading interest rates and using computer algorithms to capture trends in bonds and commodities. In 2013 it expanded into trading equity to compete with Millennium Management LLC and SAC Capital Advisors LLP. In 2011, George Soros decided to stop managing money for outside clients and turn his hedge-fund firm into a family office. Soros spoke to Platt, asking him to take on more than $1 billion for a 0.5 percent management fee and a 10 percent performance fee. Platt reportedly declined the offer, saying plenty of investors were willing to pay BlueCrest 2-and-20, the industry standard fee structure. That same year, Platt discussed the crisis in the Eurozone, attributing it to \\"the cultural and political divide\\" between north and south. \\"The reality is that there is no willingness within the Eurozone to share wealth,\\" he said. \\"In the United States, if California is having a really difficult time, the rest of the United States will send money to California. This is not the case in Europe.\\" He further maintained that Europe's problem was that \\"almost every part of it has gone wrong now. The banks are undercapitalized‚Ä¶If banks were hedge funds, and you mark them to market properly, I would say that probably most of them are insolvent.\\" By contrast, he was relatively positive about the U.S. and Germany. In 2013, BlueCrest invested $50 million in Meredith Whitney's hedge fund, Kenbelle Capital. In October of that year, BlueCrest made a redemption request, but while Kenbelle said it would comply, no repayment was forthcoming. The next year, BlueCrest sued in Bermuda to get its money back from the firm. In 2015, Whitney closed up shop and paid back all her investors, including BlueCrest. In December 2015, Platt announced that BlueCrest would return $7 billion for outside investors, take no outside money in the future, and become a private partnership. In his letter to investors explaining the change, Platt explained that \\"Recent developments in the industry, including, among other things, downward pressure on fee levels, the increasing cost of hiring the best portfolio management talent and the difficulty in tailoring investment products to meet the individual needs and constraints of a large number of diverse investors, have all significantly reduced industry profitability and flexibility.\\" Consequently \\"BlueCrest believes that a transition to a Private Investment Partnership model is now appropriate for the business.\\" In 2016, BlueCrest had a profit of almost 50 percent; in 2017, Platt \\"led his private investment firm to a 54 percent gain.\\" This contrasted with \\"mediocre returns at some of the largest hedge funds in the world,\\" noted Bloomberg News. In 2018, the Sunday Times named Platt \\"the richest hedge fund manager in the City.\\" During the year, his net wealth had grown by 25 percent. In March 2019, he was named one of the highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders by Forbes. In 2019 BlueCrest's trading operation returned 53.5% net after expenses and made Platt approximately $2 billion. = Strategy = In July 2017, Platt's investment strategy was described as follows: ‚ÄúPlatt splits BlueCrest‚Äôs assets between systematic strategies (based on pattern-spotting computer algorithms) and discretionary (human-driven) trades. The systematic trades are generally trend-following strategies ‚Äì basically, buying assets that are going up, and selling ones that are falling. He delegates the day-to-day management to his traders, but retains overall control. He believes in aggressive stop losses ‚Äì he will cut traders‚Äô allocations drastically if they lose as little as 3% of their capital, but will also lift allocations to winning trades.‚Äù In his first live television interview, given to Bloomberg on 15 December 2011, Platt said that there are ‚Äúthree things he won't touch ‚Äì exposure to banks, peripheral debt risk, and illiquid investments.‚Äù Asked how he finds ‚Äútalented traders‚Äù to employ, he has said that he seeks out ‚Äúsomeone who understands an edge.‚Äù For example, ‚ÄúI look for the type of guy in London who gets up at seven o‚Äôclock on Sunday morning when his kids are still in bed and logs on to a poker site so that he can pick off the US drunks coming home on Saturday night.‚Äù There are at least three other things he looks for in traders: first, ‚Äú[a]n understanding that the market is always right,‚Äù so that in when the market is stress, value is irrelevant; second, ‚Äú[p]aranoia,‚Äù which can lead them ‚Äúto hedge their winning trades‚Äù and help them to ‚Äúmanage when they have losing positions‚Äù; third, an ability to admit when one is wrong. Personal life In 2010, he moved from London to Geneva, Switzerland to avoid increased regulation and for \\"better staffing options\\". In 2014, it was reported that he had relocated to Jersey, along with his hedge fund, which was moving from nearby Guernsey, for tax purposes. He is a notable art collector having built a contemporary art collection not by shopping for pictures, but by commissioning them from well-known artists. He has a private showroom in the crypt of a deconsecrated church at One Marylebone, which displays a selection of art by, among others, taxidermist Polly Morgan, the Turner Prize-winning sculptor and installation artist Keith Tyson and Reece Jones \\"an artist who works mainly in charcoal\\". Platt appeared as \\"himself\\" on Showtime's series Billions in episode 1, Season 3. He also appeared as a passenger in Manny Anzalota's cab in New York on YouTube.

David Levin (top, middle), Reubin Askew (top right), and Fred Levin (bottom left). Levin Papantonio Thomas Mitchell Rafferty Proctor is an American law firm based in Pensacola, Florida, founded in 1955 by David Levin, Reubin Askew, and Fred Levin, originally under the name Levin & Askew. It is best known for its prominent role in the field of mass tort litigation, where it started and continues to host the biannual conference called Mass Torts Made Perfect. In 2016, the National Law Journal recognized Levin Papantonio as one of America's Elite Trial Law Firms. Notable cases and activities The law firm received national recognition in 1980 after receiving an $18 million jury verdict against Louisville & Nashville Railroad after one of its trains derailed in Pensacola, Florida, killing a young doctor and his wife, and leaving their two young children orphaned. The jury verdict was the largest compensatory damage verdict in U.S. history at the time. Because of the size of the verdict, the firm was featured in an April 1981 issue of US magazine. The law firm again made national news in 1989 with its creation of the first live, prime-time talk show to air lawyers providing free legal advice. The show became a lightning rod for potential legal ethics issues, with critics stating: \\"It's obviously advertising for that law firm that is slanted at having the public believe in higher verdicts, more rights of the injury party and anti-doctor.\\" The show resulted in two separate Florida Bar investigations, and one prosecution, when a law firm attorney admitted on-air: \\"I used to enjoy betting on the football games, and now they've arrested my bookie.\\" Another time, a lawyer ranted about the medical profession and accused doctors of having a \\"God-complex - they think they are above the law.\\" The law firm's most controversial act occurred in 1993 when it rewrote a Florida statute that allowed the state of Florida to sue the Tobacco Industry, and then orchestrated its passage through the state legislature. After the law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court, the Tobacco Industry settled with Florida for an unprecedented $13 billion. The secretive legal maneuvering, which some described as immoral, became part of the national debate on whether personal injury law was negatively impacting the American business environment, including a July 2000 article in Time magazine titled \\"Are Lawyers Running America?\\" that included a photo of Fred Levin wearing a red blazer and sunglasses and leaning on a vintage Rolls-Royce. In a 2014 book about the firm and the topic of personal injury litigation, Josh Young wrote, \\"It's rare that any major mass tort in the country does not present itself to Levin Papantonio. The firm clearly is considered one of the very few 800-pound gorillas in the field. It has earned that reputation over many decades . . . .\\" The magazine Action Report reported in 2014, \\"The restrictions on the rights and recoveries of victims of \\"single injury\\" cases ultimately moved many firms into mass torts, with the Levin Papantonio firm leading the way in Florida.\\" Notable members Notable members of the firm have included Reubin Askew, Fred Levin, Mike Papantonio, Robert F.

History First mentioned in 1185, a major renovation occurred in the 15th century. It was used at one time as a telegraph station. By 1900, having become greatly dilapidated, the church is said to have been disused for nearly 150 years; but was restored through the munificence and exertions of Browne Willis, the antiquary, who, in 1756, promoted a subscription for that purpose. In 1834, by a re-arrangement of the interior, 175 additional sittings were obtained. Architecture and fittings The component parts are a nave with side aisles, and a south porch, a chancel, and a west embattled tower, in which are four bells. The whole is a good specimen of Perpendicular work, without the least mixture of any other style, or the introduction of modern windows; the latter are nearly all square-headed. Three arches on each side divide the nave from the aisles. The central cross beam of the roof bears the date of 1630. There is a piscina in the south aisle. The carved oak pulpit was brought from the old church at Buckingham, upon the erection of the modern edifice. The font is octagonal in form, and on the pedestal supporting it, are four eagles displayed. The compartments are decorated with quatrefoils and foliage; and one of them has a shield with two Roman T's impaled in relievo. The chancel is plain, with open wood ceiling. Beneath the chancel arch is an oak screen. On the north side is a mural tablet of black marble to the memory of the Rev. William Watson. Parish status The church is in a joint parish with: *St Mary the Virgin's Church, Great Brickhill *St Mary Magdalene's Church, Little Brickhill *St Luke's Church, Stoke Hammond Organ The pipe organ was installed by Kirkland. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

He is also known as an industrialist who made environmental test chambers for the aircraft and aerospace industries.  Early life  Conrad's parents were James and Ella. He was born in Ludington, Michigan, on July 8, 1917. His father worked for 35 years on carferries. Conrad graduated from Ludington High School in 1935. From 1935 to 1936 he had part-time jobs as a dishwasher at Stearns Hotel and as a woodworker for Carrom Manufacturing Company and Thompson Cabinet Company, both in Ludington. During this time he took correspondence school courses to learn refrigeration. Conrad's first career job was in 1937. During this time Conrad worked full- time as a refrigeration service repairman in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He moved to Lansing, Michigan, in 1940 and worked in the refrigeration field. Conrad then moved to Holland, Michigan, in March 1941, and in that year established a refrigeration service business, having borrowed \\"three or four hundred dollars\\". In 1945 it was re-established as Charles F. Conrad Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Service/Sales Company.  Mid life  Pioneer V satellite with electronic circuits tested in Thermotron chambers In 1951 Conrad started a company called Conrad, Inc that was involved with designing and building extreme temperature environmental chambers for testing precision electrical and mechanical components. The chambers were capable of going to one hundred and twenty-five below zero. He built the first unit on the front porch of his home in Holland, Michigan, and managed to sell a few of these units, one to General Motors Heat Treat Lab in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Conrad's company eventually merged into Crampton Manufacturing Company at the end of 1954. Conrad was a Crampton company employee until 1962, when he quit and started a company called Thermotron with a budget of a thousand dollars. His new Holland company received their first order to build some environmental test chambers from Republic Aviation to test precision aircraft components under extreme temperatures. At the time he was the only employee. The company eventually grew to over 500 employees, becoming the largest in the industry. The company expanded from one office building location to seven factories in Holland, Michigan. The environmental test chambers were also used in the aerospace industry to test satellite electronics and for the national space program of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects. His company title was President, Chief Engineer, and Sales/Marketing manager. Conrad sold the company in 1980. He then operated four Ludington area family-type resorts at Hamlin Lake from 1981 to 1987. Five years later in 1992, after spending a million dollars in renovations for the resorts, he sold them.  Lake Michigan Carferry Service  SS Badger with LMC logo Conrad purchased three ships called , and from the defunct Michigan-Wisconsin Transportation company in 1991. He renamed this company Lake Michigan Carferry Service (\\"LMC\\") when the U.S. Bankruptcy Court awarded the Badger and two other ships to the Lake Michigan Carferry Service on February 18, 1992. Conrad converted Badger to a tourist passenger cruise ship and automobile carrier from a railroad carferry at a cost of $1.5 million. He put the ship back in service in 1992, hoping to get 80,000 passengers the first season. He exceeded his goal with 115,000 passengers in their first year of operation. Badger is the only ship carrying both passengers and automobiles across any of the Great Lakes, and it is the last coal fired passenger steamship in the United States. Conrad referred to the ship as \\"The Big Badger\\". Since 2009 it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.NPS S.S. Badger Badger is the largest carferry on the Great Lakes. It is four hundred feet long and travels at 18 mph to make the four- hour trip across Lake Michigan. It does almost 500 crossings per year during the summer with about six hundred passengers and just under two hundred vehicles (motorcycles, automobiles, RVs, trucks) on each trip. The ship contains 40 staterooms and an outside deck. The ship was designated a registered Wisconsin Historic Site in 1997. SS Badger was named Ship of the Year by the Steamship Historical Society of America in 2002.  Later life and death  Conrad sold Lake Michigan Carferry company to a group of its executives in 1994, headed by his son-in-law Robert \\"Bob\\" Manglitz. Conrad spent the winters of the last years of his life in Florida. He died at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, in the morning of February 9, 1995.  Family  His wife's name is Elsie Alida Conrad and his two daughters are Barbara and Janet. Janet is the wife of Robert Manglitz, the President and CEO of Lake Michigan Carferry from 1995 on.  Societies and church  Conrad was a member of the Institute of Environmental Sciences, a Paul Harris Fellow of the Holland Rotary Club, director of Ludington Economic Development Corporation, board member of Holland's Tulip Time, board member of the Holland Community Foundation and a president of Midwest Scanton Associates. He belonged to the Zion/Lutheran Church in Holland, Michigan. He was also a representative for restoring \\"Big Red\\" lighthouse at Holland, Michigan. Conrad was involved with seven schools that participated in the Tech-Prep Consortium that was associated with West Shore Community College in the Ludington area. He was named the top small business subcontractor in six Midwestern states in 1977 by the Small Business Administration.  Works  Conrad co-authored The Matt Urban Story: The Hero We Never Forgot, in 1989 along with Lt. Colonel Matt Urban (recipient of the Medal of Honor).  Inventions  Conrad patented a multiple stage refrigeration system in 1954.

Early life He was born in Glasgow, the son of a civil servant, Archibald Ogg. He was educated at Glasgow University and Lincoln College, Oxford, after he won a scholarship. Ogg won the Stanhope Prize (1910), the Lothian Prize (1911) and the Chancellor's Essay Prize (1912).'Mr. David Ogg', The Times (30 March 1965), p. 15. Academic career In 1912 he won an Open Fellowship at New College, Oxford, where he served as tutor and later as sub-warden and librarian. During the First World War, Ogg served in the Royal Navy as Paymaster. His most popular work, Europe in the Seventeenth Century, was first published in 1923 and went through eight editions. Ogg also wrote histories of the reigns of Charles II and James II. He retired in 1956 and subsequently held visiting professorships at South Carolina University, Charleston College and the University of Texas. In 1959 he was elected to an Honorary Fellowship at New College. Personal life Ogg married Emily Louise White in 1917 and they had one son, John. Assessment In 1963, H. E. Bell and R. L. Ollard edited Ogg's festschrift and said of Ogg: > Those who have had the privilege of knowing David Ogg as a tutor or a > colleague will not need to be reminded of those qualities of wit and > intellectual elegance, of originality of thought and expression, of common > sense applied in an uncommon way, that characterise his talk as unmistakenly > as his writing. The deceptive ease with which his exact scholarship and wide > erudition have been put at our disposal is no small part of the pleasant > debt we all owe him. > The same holds true for, though in the nature of the case less personally, > for those who know him only through his books. It would be an imperceptive > reader who had failed to notice that in both the fields that Ogg has made > his own, the England of Charles II and the Europe of Louis XIV, he has > challenged both the accepted historiography of the period and the > fashionable portrayal of the two eponymous figures of the age. It would be > imperceptive, but it would not be impossible. The modulations of irony, the > subtle effects of tone, the humility in which, above all, the style reveals > the man, will be lost on such as prefer vulgar colours, familiar platitudes, > and the techniques of self-advertisement in which modern scholarship can > report such notable advances. But the continued and increasing success of > Europe in the Seventeenth Century and England in the Reign of Charles II > gives good ground for believing that the rare qualities of which his pupils > at Oxford and in America have been the chief beneficiaries have been > recognised and valued by a far wider public.

The centre's permanent building, branded Studio Bell, is located at 850 4th Street S.E. in Downtown East Village.  History  =Beginnings= The National Music Centre and its collections origins can be traced to the installation of a pipe organ (known as the Carthy Organ) in Calgary‚Äôs Jack Singer Concert Hall in 1987. The installation of this instrument was the genesis of the International Organ Festival and Competition operated by TriumphEnt from 1990 to 2002. It also subsequently led to the creation of a new organization known as the Chinook Keyboard Centre, which began developing a collection of keyboard instruments in mid-1996. \\"Better Days: The Rebirth of Calgary‚Äôs Legendary King Edward Hotel\\".

In 2005, an exhibition commemorating 100 years of music in Alberta to mark the Centennial led to plans to expand the organization‚Äôs scope to chronicle, celebrate, and foster a broader vision for music in Canada. In February 2012, Cantos became the National Music Centre. As the centre began to outgrow its space, plans for construction of a 60,000 square-foot facility in Calgary‚Äôs East Village with a projected cost of $168 million. With a design by Portland architect Brad Cloepfil, construction began on February 22, 2013. The final steel beam was set into place on December 12, 2014. The building eventually cost $191 million. The National Music Centre held its last public tour at the Customs House on December 28, 2014. After that the location shut down in order to begin the move to the new centre.

Overview The library is at the North Hall, and this was opened on 2012. There are three floors in this building, with the ground floor having 15 classrooms. The library uses the second and third floors of the building. On the second floor, computers are available in the information common area. There are 25 group study rooms. and one classroom for library instruction. Appropriate assistance can be found facilitated by library employees within three desk areas: Reference, Circulation and New Media. On the third floor, there is the law collection classroom and the main stacks of circulation books. The North Hall has a distinction of being a green building, with LEED Silver certification. History interior of the library The North Hall is the second building on BCC's campus to be known as the library location. It had an official ribbon cutting ceremony on September 21, 2012. The Gould Memorial library is from NYU's previous occupation on this campus. It is recognizable by the rotunda dome, and is currently used as an event space. When Bronx Community College began operations on this campus around 1973, Meister Hall was used as the main library facility. With the collection and needs expanding, Sage Hall was used eventually to house the Gerald S. Lieblich Learning Resource Center that acted as a support for the main library and other department's needs. This is mentioned in a printed handbook history written by Professor Annette Peretz.

Mainz 1491 Titlepage Fruits of Paradise. Hortus sanitatis 1491 The Hortus Sanitatis (also written Ortus; Latin for The Garden of Health), a Latin natural history encyclopaedia, was published by Jacob Meydenbach in Mainz, Germany in 1491. It describes species in the natural world along with their medicinal uses and modes of preparation. It followed the Latin Herbarius moguntinus (1484) and the German Gart der Gesundheit (1485), that Peter Sch√∂ffer had published in Mainz. Unlike these earlier works, besides dealing with herbs, the Hortus sanitatis deals with animals, birds, fish and stones too. Moreover the author does not restrict himself to dealing only with real creatures, but also includes accounts of mythical animals such as the dragon, harpy, hydra, myrmecoleon, phoenix, and zitiron.  Author  The author is unknown. Occasionally the Frankfurt physician Johann Wonnecke of Kaub is incorrectly named as the author.  Contents  Set in two columns, the work contains five sections describing simple drugs used for therapy: # De Herbis with 530 chapters on herbs. # De Animalibus with 164 chapters on land animals (Chapter 1: De homo). # De Avibus with 122 chapters on birds and other airworthy animals. # De Piscibus with 106 chapters on aquatic animals. # De Lapidibus with 144 chapters on semi-precious stones, ores and minerals. :: As appendix a treatise on uroscopy and several detailed registers. Set in two columns, each chapter is headed by a picture. The following text gives a general description of the related simple drug and under the title of ¬ªoparetiones¬´ a list of its effects on the human body. The plants of the section \\"De Herbis\\" were determined by B. and H. Baumann (2010, pp. 205-222) according to current binominal nomenclature.  Sources  The author has composed the Hortus sanitatis out of well-known medieval encyclopaedias, such as the Liber pandectarum medicinae omnia medicine simplicia continens of Matthaeus Silvaticus (14th c.) and the Speculum natural of Vincent of Beauvais (13th century).Matthaeus (Silvaticus) Moretus.

The order to construct the ship was given by the Admiralty of the Meuse. The ship was commissioned in 1786.https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/NG-MC-267 In 1795, the ship was commissioned in the Batavian Navy. On 11 October 1797 the Staaten Generaal took part in the Battle of Camperdown as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Samuel Story. The ship was engaged by , Admiral Adam Duncan's flagship, and caught fire twice. The fire was extinguished both times, but the Staaten Generaal drifted away from the battle and was unable to continue the fight in a favourable position. On the morning of 12 October she escaped to Texel with the remainder of the Batavian fleet.J. C. de Jonge, Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche zeewezen: Vierde Deel, Eerste Stuk (Haarlem: Kruseman, 1861), 342-358. In 1798, the ship was renamed to Bato. She sailed to the Cape Colony in 1802, after which she sailed on to Batavia. Upon her return to the Cape, she underwent inspection and was found to be in poor condition, and was turned into a hulked gun platform. She was anchored in Simon's Bay to guard approaches to the naval base. When the Batavians were defeated in the Battle of Blaauwberg, Bato was burned and scuttled to prevent her from being captured.

Commentaries to Staff-Captain Rybnikov. The Complete A.I.Kuprin, in 9 volumes. Vol. 4. Pravda Publishers. Ogonyok magazine library. Moscow. 1964. Pp. 488-489. Background Kuprin had for a long time been intrigued by the notion of a spy carrying out his lone mission in the heart of an enemy nation, according to biographer Nicholas Luker. In his dreams Romashov (The Duels main character) had seen himself as a spy in Germany. Kuprin's Rybnikov was based on an officer of that name whom he met in one of his favorite haunts, the \\"Capernaum\\" restaurant in Petersburg. The real Rybnikov was a Siberian, wounded at the battle of Mukden, whose Mongolian features reminded Kuprin of a Japanese. History The story, written in 1905 in Balaklava, was lauded by Maxim Gorky who rated it as one Kuprin's finest ones. He included it in several compilations (Russian Writers Series, 1919; Gosizdat's Russian Classics, 1928; Academia Publishers, 1935).The Archives of A.M.Gorky. Sovetskoye Iskusstvo, 1936, No.29, June 23. Kuprin himself in 1909 referred to \\"Junior Captain Rybnikov\\" as his best story ever written.Talking to A.I.Kuprin. Odesskye Novosti, 1909, No.7934, October 8. Summary Junior Captain Rybnikov is on a ceaseless trip through Saint Petersburg military departments ostensibly trying to secure financial assistance as a wounded veteran, pestering officials with petty complaints, patriotic rants and naive- sounding questions concerning the state of the Russian military. Newspaper reporter Shchavinsky, a shrewd man (\\"clearly a self-portrait by Kuprin,\\" according to Luker), spots some flaws in Rybnikov's over-stylized veneer (the superfluity of Russian proverbs, occasional 'clever' words, fine silk linen of a kind Russian soldiers never wear, obvious inner strain and occasional glimpses of hatred in his look) and thinks himself to be on the verge of exposing a Japanese spy. Excited by his discovery, he takes Rybnikov with himself on a binge. As his admiration for this man's audacity, self-control and artistism grows, the journalist promises the Captain never to give him away to the authorities, but Rybnikov remains unfazed. Equally impressed with her unusual visitor, so unlike her common clientele, is Nastya, a prostitute in a brothel which the Shchavinsky-led company visits. Ironically, it's this woman, stricken by Rybnikov's tenderness, noble manners and passion, proves to be his undoing. Motivated by petty vanity, she boasts to a local thief (and, apparently, a secret police agent) who rests in a nearby room, about a strange visitor she's just had, mentioning the latter pronouncing some Japanese words as he was falling asleep. The thief calls for the police and ventures an assault. Trying to escape, Rybnikov jumps out of the window, breaks his leg and gets caught. =Critique= The story, set in Saint Petersburg, provided Kuprin with an opportunity to comment on the Russo-Japanese War on the Pacific and the way the Russia led it. According to Luker, > Through Rybnikov's talk of the war Kuprin reveals the incompetence of the > Russian army in the field. Those in command fail to adapt to the terrain, > their men are supplied with shells of the wrong caliber and obliged to fight > for days without food, while their officers play cards and take mistresses. > All the while the Japanese fight with the efficiency of machines. Morale is > disastrously low in the Russian ranks, and mutiny increasingly apparent. > More ferment still is to be seen in the navy, where officers are afraid to > meet their sailors ashore. Through the military bureaucrats whom Rybnikov visits, Kuprin points ironically to the reasons for Russia's defeat in the Far East. \\"And that's what Russian officers are like!\\" they exclaim. \\"Just look at that fellow [Rybnikov]. Isn't it clear why we're losing one battle after another? Dullness, stupidity, complete absence of any self-respect... Poor Russia!\\" Staff-Captain Rybnikov. The Complete A.I.Kuprin, in 9 volumes.

He has published theory, artist's books, a collection of poems, plays and novels inspired by quantum physics. He perpetuated a reflexion initiated by Paul Klee and Edgar Var√®se on the transposition of musical structures into formal constructions. He created plant architectures which come close to site-specific art, environmental sculpture and generative art. Biography Jean-Max Albert was born on 25 July 1942, in Loches, France. He studied at the Ecole R√©gionale des Beaux-Arts d'Angers then at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts de Paris, with frequent visits to the Louvre, across the river (cf An Afternoon in the Louvre).

Beside sculptures related to music, he conceived a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The utopian Calmoduline Monument is based on the property of a protein, calmodulin, to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind,rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene. The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its ¬´ typical ¬ª growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant‚Äôs ¬´ decisions ¬ª. This permanent show, installed in a public place, would suggest a level of fundamental biological activity.Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet & Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117 (in English) Painting Portraits of the Loire ; Framing Sculptures ; Que voit-on quand on ne regarde pas ?

When looking in the Observation Sculpture through its sights (an aperture or circles), the space beyond is (roughly) framed. Combining the different perspectives framed, the little sculpture, usually in bronze, takes shape after the space it is aiming at. An Observation Sculpture proposes a summary of this space concentrated, agglomerated and stuck together in a kind of core, like a geometric model of the site‚Äôs character.Jardin-de-la-Treille, wikimapiaBruno Suner, Les sculptures de vis√©es du Parc de La Villette, Urbanisme n¬∞215, 1986 =Anamorphosis= Albert realized Un carr√© pour un square, Cube fant√¥me and Reflet anamorphose,http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf three pieces according to anamorphosis principle as described by Matilde Marcolli : ¬´ If the vector space one starts with is the 3-dimensional space, whose vectors have 3-coordinates v = (x1, x2, x3), then, as long as v is nonzero and a real number Œª is also nonzero, the vector v = (x1, x2, x3) and the vector Œªv = (Œªx1, Œªx2, Œªx3) point along the same straight line and we consider them as being the same point of our projective space. ¬ªMatilde Marcolli, The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art, Century Books, Pasadena, July 2016 For Un carr√© pour un square the perspective of a square is seen from a specific vantage point. The design is formed by a set of lines of narrow plates of Carrara marble imbricated in the walls of the surrounding buildings and in the vestiges of a former construction site.

Both previous series are based on the television series Voltron. Voltron is the name of the robot that the main characters pilot to fight evil in space. The series stars five young soldiers who are recruited to find the title character in deep space, and to use Voltron to defend the galaxy. Modern Comics In 1985, Modern Comics produced a three-issue mini-series based on the Lion Voltron television show. Devils' Due In 2002, comic book publisher Devil's Due announced it had acquired the rights to publish Voltron comic books. Devil's Due, through Image Comics, published a five issue mini-series (preceded by a #0 issue from Dreamwave) which featured the Lion Voltron incarnation of the character and rebooted the property. This was then followed by an ongoing series self- published by Devil's Due, which was placed on hiatus in 2005 after the eleventh issue, due to poor sales. Devil's Due announced in January 2008 that the five-issue mini-series, the eleven issues of the ongoing series, and the #0 issue would be collected into a Voltron Omnibus trade paperback that would also include the unpublished twelfth issue of the ongoing series that would wrap up all the storylines. In July 2008, a new five issue mini-series was released by Devil's Due, which picked up where the ongoing series left off. This series further explored the origins of Lion Voltron's creation, from 12,000 years in the past to the present day. The mini-series showed Voltron existing as a single construct created by sorcerers and scientists, resembling a knight. During its battle with the first Drule Empire, Voltron was tricked by Haggar into landing on a black comet with the gravitational attraction of a singularity. Voltron was then attacked by Haggar, and blown into five pieces. However, the intervention of a sorcerer resulted in the five pieces becoming the five lions as they descended onto Arus. The original five issue mini- series was adapted as the 2007 motion comic Voltron: Defenders of the Universe - REVELATIONS. Its sequel, Voltron: Defenders of the Universe - PARADISE LOST, adapted the first storyarc of the ongoing series, introducing the V-15 and its pilots. Dynamite In 2011, comic book publisher Dynamite Entertainment announced it had acquired the rights to publish Voltron comic books through parent company Dynamic Forces.

It is part of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands ecoregion. It is the 11th largest of the 20 National Parks in Zambia. The park was initially gazetted as a Game Reserve in 1941, and as a National Park in 1972. It is located in a district of the same name (Lavushimanda). From 2011 Lavushi Manda has been managed by the Kasanka Trust along with the Kasanka National Park under an Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife. Initial establishment work at Lavushi Manda was undertaken with funding provided by the World Bank.  Topography and hydrology  Lavushi Manda lies on the plateau area of Lavushimanda District between the Muchinga Escarpment and the alluvial flats of the Bangweulu Wetlands. The scenery is dominated by the spectacular 47 km long Lavushi Manda mountain range in the southern half of the park. This range reaches up to 1811 meters altitude, forming one of the highest points in Zambia. Vertical cliffs characterise parts of the eastern slopes. The western slopes are rocky but typically vegetated, while there are substantial rocky plateau areas on top of the range. Away from this range, the park is dominated by undulating or rather flat terrain, covered by vast stretches of miombo woodlands interspersed with large seasonally wet grasslands and valleys (dambos) feeding into numerous seasonal and perennial streams. Evergreen riparian forest lines much of the banks of the perennial streams. Lavushi Manda contains a high number of large dambo plains which form the headwaters of numerous seasonal and perennial streams. Perennial rivers which drain the park are, from southwest to northeast, the Lulimala, Lukulu, Lumbatwa (including the Lubweshi) and Mufubushi. All of these streams form part of the boundaries and, with the exception of the Lukulu, have their sources on the boundaries of the park. These streams all flow directly into the Bangweulu Wetlands. The streams draining Lavushi Manda are of critical importance for the ecologically extremely rich Bangweulu Wetlands. The inner deltas of the Lukulu and Lumbatwa rivers are among the richest parts of the Wetlands. There are numerous rocky pans and flat plains throughout the park which form seasonal lakes. Although there are no truly permanent lakes in the park, the Chibembe Plain and Lake Mikonko keep a substantial surface of standing water well into the dry season.  Habitats  Lavushi Manda falls within the Central Zambezian Miombo Woodland Ecoregion (WWF Global 200 Ecoregions). The ecosystem can be considered typical for the plateau areas of central and northern Zambia, with a mixture of Zambezian elements and Congo Basin elements. The key habitats and with that core ecological qualities of the park are the fairly isolated Lavushi Manda mountain range, large seasonally wet dambo grasslands, vast tracts of pristine woodlands and long combined length of highly diverse streams and rivers and associated (seasonally) wet habitats. Deciduous \\"Open Forest\\" or woodland covers approximately 80% of the park. Miombo Woodland is the principal type, characterised by a dominance of trees from the genera Brachystegia, Isoberlinia, Julbernardia and Uapaca. Riparian Forest occurs as a narrow evergreen strip following the perennial streams or as a deciduous or semi-deciduous strip fringing the seasonal streams. A typical feature of the riparian forests in Lavushi Manda are the frequent presence of Raphia farinifera (Raphia Palm), which is absent in the nearby Kasanka National Park and most of Bangweulu Game Management Area. Grasslands cover no less than 17% of the park. Seasonally wet headwater dambo grasslands include the larger part of the grasslands in LMNP. Bog grasslands are common especially near the mountains where seepage water creates year-round wet conditions.  Fauna  = Mammals = Since 2008 a total of 50 large mammal species has been recorded in Lavushi Manda. Of these, six species are listed as threatened by the IUCN: Straw-coloured Fruit Bat (NT), Leopard (NT), Lion (VU), African Elephant (VU), Hippopotamus (VU) and Puku (NT). Protracted poaching led to serious depletion of all larger mammal populations prior to 2011. With the involvement of the Kasanka Trust in park management, improved law-enforcement efforts have been possible since 2011. These seem to have already lead to significant recovery of several large mammal species. Densities however are still very low. The only ungulates which are currently fairly common are Common Duiker, Reedbuck and Sable. There are small herds of Puku. The most common (diurnal) large mammal probably is the Kinda Baboon. Warthog are also frequently sighted. = Birds = Lavushi Manda is recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) on account of the presence of a large number of biome-restricted species and threatened species. To date 349 bird species have been recorded. Eleven (near-)threatened bird species have been recorded in the Lavushi Manda. Of these, Bateleur, Crowned Eagle, Martial Eagle and Southern Ground Hornbill occur in good numbers. The rare and enigmatic Shoebill breeds in the adjacent Bangweulu GMA. Lavushi Manda is home to rock- associated species ‚Äì these are basically absent from other parts of the Bangweulu system and also not easily seen in the nearby Luangwa system. The presence of Verreaux's Eagle is notable. Other specials are mainly species of dambo grasslands such as Locustfinch, Streaky-breasted Flufftail, and Blue Quail; miombo woodlands such as Anchieta's Sunbird, Anchieta's Barbet, and B√∂hm's Flycatcher; and rivers with associated evergreen forest such as . Finfoot, Purple-throated Cuckooshrike, and B√∂hm's Bee-eater. The park holds large numbers of several Palaearctic migrants. Collared Flycatcher occurs in particularly high densities. The Lavushi Manda mountain chain forms a regionally important flight path for among others raptors, bee-eaters and swallows. = Fish = Some 30 species have been recorded in Lavushi Manda to date. Although this number is thought to constitute only about half the number of fish species present. Species diversity in catches downstream from Mumbatuta Falls has been higher than further upstream, suggesting that these falls are a barrier for fish migration. The Bangweulu Killifish, a Zambian endemic with restricted range (from Mansa to Lavushi Manda), is listed as Endangered occurs in the park and Greenhead Tilapia is listed as Vulnerable. Several species that are sensitive to high fishing pressures are common, notably the Yellowfish Labeobarbus trachypterus. Tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus) occurs in the Lukulu River.  Development and management  Prior to 2011 resources available to be committed to Lavushi Manda National Park had dwindled such that there was no effective management. Poaching within the park was rife, with all large mammal numbers being almost completely wiped out. The Kasanka Trust, who for many years had been successfully operating the nearby Kasanka National Park extended its operations to Lavushi Manda with assistance from the World Bank. This program saw the establishment of park infrastructure such as administrative buildings, a road network and a basic conservation centre. Work also began to work cooperatively with communities who had begun to illegally settle within the park boundaries. By 2016 all illegal settlers within the park had voluntarily resettled outside park boundaries. The Kasanka Trust now manages the park under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW). The Trust continues to develop the road network at the site while working with the DNPW on combating illegal poaching. The effects of the increased anti poaching efforts at the park are being seen in increased mammal populations. The not for profit Kasanka Trust generates revenue to operate Lavushi Manda mainly from its tourism operations at Kasanka National Park, however it is still reliant on external funding in the form of grants and donations to fund part of its operations. It works with various partners to achieve conservation outcomes.  Tourism  Tourism at Lavushi Manda is still in its infancy, and it could be considered one of Zambia's last \\"undiscovered\\" gems. There a three rustic campsites that have been developed: Mumbatuta, Kapandalupilli and Peak. Another campsite at Chibembe is no longer maintained but is still in existence for adventurous campers. The Kasanka Trust is opening a tented camp in 2017 on the Lukulu River. This will feature 4 permanent canvas tents and be a base for anglers, bird watchers and hikers and nature lovers. The mountain range through the park offers excellent potential for hikers, as well as good possibilities for rock climbing although to date there have been no routes mapped. Recreational angling is possible in the park with a permit. With its dramatic landscape Lavushi Manda also offers excellent photography options.

Initially a literary vehicle for the Religious and Philosophical Meetings, it was aiming to promote the so-called \\"Godseeking\\" doctrine through the artistic means of Russian Symbolism. History The first issue of Novy Put came out in November 1902. The magazine's editor-in- chief was Pyotr Pertsov, but the real leaders were Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius. The magazine, addressing the Saint Petersburg's intelligentsia, stood in opposition to the Moscow branch of Symbolists which gathered round the Scorpion publishing house and were led by Valery Bryusov. Novy Put remained loyal to Symbolism's initial values (\\"Arts for arts' sake\\", the cult of individuality) even if Merezhkovskys have by this time condemned \\"the new individualism\\" which, as Gippius put it, \\"devoured our society as a whole and is bound to eat Art too.\\" While Mir Iskusstva (the magazine the Merezhkovskys were in close contact earlier) boasted a large and lavishly illustrated arts section, Novy Put was structured in accordance with the Russian 'thick journal' tradition. The poetry was provided mostly by the Symbolists: Konstantin Balmont, Fyodor Sologub, Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis, Nikolai Minsky, Valery Bryusov, Alexander Blok, Merezhkovsky and Gippius. The prose section's most prominent publication turned out to be Merezhkovsky's Peter and Alexis, the third and final novel of the Christ and Antichrist trilogy. Also published in Novy Put were Gippius' short stories, The Sting of Death by Fyodor Sologub, works by Alexei Remizov, Boris Zaytsev, Sergeyev-Tsensky. More popular proved to be the non-literary sections, like \\"The Notes from the Religious and Philosophical Meetings,\\" \\"Religious and Philosophical Chronicles,\\" \\"From the Private Correspondence\\" and \\"One's Private Corner,\\" the latter hosted by Vasily Rozanov. Here the authors could experiment freely without feeling constrained by the Merezhkovskys' ideological schemes. Among the notable works of non-fiction published by Novy Put were \\"The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God\\" by Vyacheslav Ivanov and \\"Spiritualism as Antichristianity\\" by Pavel Florensky. In summer 1904 Pertsov was succeeded by Dmitry Filosofov as an editor-in-chief. The ban, imposed upon the publication of the Religious and Philosophical Society's protocols, as well as financial problems caused the decline of the magazine's popularity. As Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov, Nikolai Lossky and Semyon Frank arrived, the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their influential Philosophy section. In the early 1905 the publication of Novy Put stopped and, for subscribers, was temporarily substituted by another journal, Voprosy Zhizny (Life Questions) edited by Lossky.

An eruv is a land area surrounded by a boundary of religious significance, often marked by small plastic pipes (called lechis) attached to utility poles. The demarcation permits Orthodox Jews to push or carry objects (such as prayer books, keys, or baby strollers) within the eruv on the Jewish Sabbath that otherwise is considered forbidden under Orthodox Jewish law. The three municipalities ordered that the borders of the eruv be dismantled having been erected without the appropriate consents. Many Mahwah residents angrily protested against the prospect of Orthodox Jews from Rockland County, New York using local parks or seeking to buy homes there. After no agreement could be reached, the eruv association brought suit against each of the municipalities. Mahwah's actions in passing a township ordinance to bar nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks, and the hostility of some residents and council members towards those who supported the eruv led Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy and others to make accusations of antisemitism. The presiding judge in the lawsuits, John Michael Vazquez, in January 2018 made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain. Mahwah settled a lawsuit from the New Jersey Attorney General accusing it of discrimination. Background Bergen County, New Jersey. Mahwah is the large area at upper left (northwest), with Upper Saddle River and Montvale the next to the east along the state line (at top). Location map of Bergen County in New Jersey. Rockland County in New York is seen, in part, to the north. The township of Mahwah, and the boroughs of Upper Saddle River and Montvale, are neighboring municipalities in northwestern Bergen County, New Jersey. All three are adjacent to the state line with New York, on the other side of which is Rockland County, where there are large communities of Orthodox Jews. An eruv (plural \\"eruvin\\", or sometimes \\"eruvim\\") is an enclosure defined by string, rope, wires, cables, etc., that allows observant Jews, including the Orthodox, to carry or push objects further than is normally permitted on the Jewish Sabbath (or Shabbat). Normally, on Shabbat, an object may not be taken from a private domain, such as a house, into a public one, such as a street or sidewalk, or moved, in a public area, more than 4 cubits (about 6 feet; 1.7 meters). \\"Domain\\" is a technical term referring to how enclosed an area is, not property ownership. Objects may be moved freely if they remain within a private domain, and an eruv effectively extends the private domain through the area it encloses, including streets and sidewalks. The boundary of an eruv is often marked by utility poles surrounding a given area, with the space between regarded as doorways, topped by lintels, the telephone or power wires. The poles are regarded as doorposts, and are marked by lechis (singular: lechi), solid objects such as lengths of twine or of plastic pipe, which run from near the ground to just below the wires. In short, the act of stringing such a boundary around a public area by a Jewish community creates the pretense for its members that that public area is enclosed for the limited purpose of allowing the members to do some otherwise forbidden things in that public area on the Sabbath. There are many requirements for eruvin; the Talmud devotes an entire tractate to the subject. This complexity makes rabbinic supervision and regular inspection mandatory. An operating eruv allows observant Jews to carry prayer books from home to synagogue on Shabbat, or to push strollers or baby carriages. An eruv boundary, Airmont, New York. Note the white plastic lechi at right of nearest pole. In Teaneck, in southeastern Bergen County and home to large numbers of Orthodox Jews, an eruv has existed since the 1970s with little controversy, and, as the Jewish population increased, was extended to nearby Bogota and Bergenfield. Other eruvin in Bergen County are in Fair Lawn and in Paramus. A previous instance in which an eruv had been constructed in Bergen County, and had been challenged by local authorities, occurred in Tenafly, in the eastern part of the county. Attempts by municipal authorities to ban eruvin had failed when challenged in the federal courts, and the settlement in 2006 after a six-year battle obliged the borough to pay $325,000 for the eruv association's legal costs. In most cases involving conflict over whether an eruv should be permitted, the municipality has lost and the construction of the eruv allowed to continue. Construction and controversy Portion of a lechi attached to a utility pole, Mahwah, New Jersey Orthodox Jews in Rockland County gained a license from Orange and Rockland Utilities (which serves parts of both Rockland County in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey) to construct an eruv using its utility poles in 2015, and in March 2017 the company granted permission for the South Monsey Eruv Fund to install lechis, made from white PVC pipe, on its utility poles in northwestern Bergen County. This was an extension of an existing eruv in Rockland County, and was intended to run through Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale. According to Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz, head of the eruv association, the purpose was to accommodate those living in Rockland County close to the border, near New York State Route 59. The boundaries had to be run through New Jersey due to the lack of a road along the state line. Mahwah police noted construction being done on utility poles in May and made inquiries. On learning that Orange and Rockland had authorized the work, they provided police protection, for which the department was paid about $2,000 by the eruv fund. The work in Mahwah was complete by June. When the matter became generally known in mid-July, there was what local reporter Tom Nobile called a \\"firestorm of opposition\\" from local residents, with some expressing concerns that the eruv would allow Orthodox communities in Rockland County to expand into New Jersey. Groups formed on social media, including one named Mahwah Strong, in opposition to the eruv. Mahwah Strong claimed 3,000 members within days; a founder, Robert Ferguson, stated that his group would act as a check and balance to ensure the township enforced its laws, and noted, \\"I don't view this as a hostile takeover of the town.\\" Two hundred people gathered in a Mahwah park on July 22 to support the eruv's removal. An online petition to \\"Protect the Quality of Our Community in Mahwah\\", initiated by former township council member John Roth, reached 1,200 names before being taken down due to what Roth called inappropriate comments, made by some signers. Similarly, Mahwah Strong lost its Facebook page following an influx of comments deemed \\"hateful\\". Municipal and public reaction Mahwah tried to ban out-of-staters from its parks. Airmount Park shown; seen in 2018. In early July 2017, the eruv was completed in part of Upper Saddle River. Montvale acted first against the eruv, with Mayor Michael Ghassali issuing a stop work order on July 10, after the eruv association had rented equipment and arranged with local police to provide security. Montvale authorities objected on the grounds that the lechis constituted a sign, forbidden by borough ordinance. This was done prior to construction with the result that the eruv did not extend into Montvale. On July 18, Upper Saddle River's attorney sent a letter demanding the removal of the lechis that had been erected there, with a deadline of July 26, but the borough agreed to let them remain for the time being after two New York State residents filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark, requesting a temporary restraining order against the borough and Mayor Joanne Minichetti. The borough's agreement was in exchange for an undertaking from the eruv association not to expand the eruv, and the motion for a restraining order was withdrawn. The eruv was vandalized on July 26 and 27, requiring immediate repair work. Mahwah's township engineer, Mike Kelly, sent a letter to the eruv association on July 21, taking a stance similar to Montvale's, and demanding the removal of the eruv by August 4. Mayor Bill Laforet stated, \\"This sends a very strong message to those who choose to violate our sign ordinances.\\" On June 29, the Mahwah Township Council had passed an ordinance, effective July 27, barring nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks. Residents had complained that out-of-staters were flooding Mahwah's parks, sometimes by the busload. After the ordinance passed, but before it went into effect, Mahwah police chief James Batelli received many phone calls from residents asking that it be enforced against Orthodox Jews. He contacted the Bergen County Prosecutor, Gurbir Grewal, for advice. On July 27, the date the ordinance was to go into effect, Grewal issued a directive ordering Mahwah police to disregard the ban, stating that the ban could lead to racial profiling, unlawful searches and seizures and the illegal targeting of Orthodox Jews. In response, Rob Hermansen, president of the township council, stated that that body would rework the ordinance to continue putting Mahwah residents first. When the Mahwah Township Council met on the evening of July 27, it did so before an overflow crowd. Despite warnings from the township attorney not to discuss issues of religion, some did. Others complained of nonresidents crowding parks, and that they had been visited by people wanting to buy their homes. The lawyer for Mahwah Strong urged the council to enforce the law by requiring the takedown of the eruv. Ferguson was quoted as saying at the meeting, \\"We do not want these people living in our neighborhoods. We want them following the law.\\" As the eruv controversy intensified, Mahwah and Montvale, as well as neighboring boroughs, enacted or made stricter ordinances restricting those making unsolicited offers to buy houses from knocking on doors. Municipal officials stated that this was being done because of the concerns of residents, who feared the Orthodox moving in would result in a population explosion, that the schools would suffer, and high-density housing built. Residents cited Lakewood in Ocean County as an example of such problems. To a standing ovation from some 200 residents in attendance, the Mahwah council on August 10 unanimously voted to issue summonses because the eruv had not been taken down. Mayor Laforet, though, urged the council not to take this step, pointing to the large expense the unsuccessful eruv litigation had cost Tenafly, and advocated negotiation. In response to the council's action, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association (of which the South Monsey group is a part) and several Orthodox Jews resident in Rockland County filed suit in federal court against Mahwah on August 11, and promised to defy any summonses. Residents of Teaneck and Englewood, each in southeastern Bergen County and home to large communities of Orthodox Jews, had gone to Mahwah and Upper Saddle River to make known their views at council meetings. Council members from Teaneck and Englewood had spoken there in support of the eruv's retention, only to meet a hostile reception. Citizens for a Better Upper Saddle River posted a screenshot of the Teaneck council schedule online, urging members to mark their calendars with the dates. Council member Mark Schwartz of Teaneck stated that visitors would be welcome, and could view how a diverse community functioned. Michael Cohen of the Englewood council stated, \\"We have repeatedly attempted to communicate to the leadership of Upper Saddle River and Mahwah why it is that the rhetoric and actions being seen and taken by certain members of their governing bodies and by certain members of their communities are being viewed by the outside world as anti-Semitic. However, those attempts have largely continued to fall on deaf ears.\\" Litigation Following failed settlement negotiations and a closed-door council meeting on October 10, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association and individual plaintiffs sued Montvale on October 18, alleging that Mayor Ghassali's stop work order inhibited them in practicing their religion. They cited a 2015 statement from then-mayor Roger Fyfe, from when rumors of an eruv had first circulated, that an eruv was a simple accommodation and a matter in which the borough had only a slight part. The plaintiffs also alleged that Mahwah and Upper Saddle River were aware of the eruv construction, but had no problem with it until they gave in to a campaign of xenophobia and antisemitism. The next day, the Democratic candidate for governor, Phil Murphy, accused the residents of Mahwah of causing an \\"overarching perception of anti-Semitism and discrimination\\". According to Murphy, \\"When a Holocaust survivor at a public meeting is heckled, and then denounced as a fraud, there is a problem. When well-intentioned residents are disparaged as 'paid actors' for a 'Jewish money conspiracy scheme' there is a problem.\\" On October 24, the Attorney General of New Jersey, Christopher Porrino, sued Mahwah and its council, alleging that by voting for the parks ban and for the summonses, they had violated the constitutional rights of Orthodox Jews. The case, filed in state court in Hackensack, sought nullification of the council's actions, statutory penalties, attorney's fees, and the return of $3.5 million in state-provided Green Acres funds with which Mahwah had purchased and maintained parks. Under the Green Acres program, parks benefitting from the funds may not discriminate, including on the basis of religion or residency. Porrino stated, \\"To think that there are local governments here in New Jersey, in 2017, making laws on the basis of some archaic, fear-driven and discriminatory mindset, is deeply disappointing and shocking to many, but it is exactly what we are alleging in this case. Of course, in this case we allege the target of the small-minded bias is not African-Americans, but Orthodox Jews. Nonetheless, the hateful message is the same.\\" Mayor Laforet accused Council President Hermansen of fear-mongering and stoking passions, \\"His disgraceful behavior is now worsened by the severe potential financial penalties facing the township's taxpayer.\\" In the municipal election on November 7, Mahwah voters easily re-elected two anti- eruv council members, defeating challengers supported by Laforet. The case was removed from state to federal court by Mahwah on November 22 as it raised questions under the federal constitution. On December 1, the council voted unanimously to allocate $175,000 to fight the lawsuits, which supplemented the $90,000 previously appropriated. In the Upper Saddle River case, on October 10, 2017, the eruv association moved for a preliminary injunction allowing the eruv to remain pending the outcome of the litigation. In support, the association provided documentation showing that Mayor Minichetti had told the borough council about the proposed eruv in 2015, and the new sign ordinance had rapidly followed. In response to the motion, filed on November 2, Upper Saddle River stated that the sign law was tightened because of a divisive municipal election in 2014, that had seen many signs. The borough argued that the lawsuit was premature, as the eruv association had not sought permission. It argued that it had not violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs; its sign ordinance was content-neutral, banning all signs of whatever sort, and thus the plaintiffs had not been discriminated against. It alleged that permission to erect the lechis from Orange and Rockland was insufficient; the eruv association also had to comply with local law, and in any event the communications company Verizon had joint use of the poles and had not been asked for consent. Upper Saddle River distinguished its situation from that of Tenafly, stating that in Tenafly, exceptions had been made to the sign ordinance, but in Upper Saddle River it had been strictly enforced. Towards the end of December, Montvale Mayor Ghassali indicated that his borough was negotiating with the plaintiffs, seeking to reach an amicable settlement of the federal lawsuit. Settlements Murphy was elected governor in November and designated Bergen County Prosecutor Grewal as the new Attorney General. Thus, once they took office, opponents of Mahwah's position would hold powerful posts in the state capital of Trenton, and municipal officials began to have second thoughts about whether to fight the eruv. On December 14, 2017, following the advice of legal counsel, the Mahwah council repealed the still-unenforced ban on out-of-state park users, and abandoned an attempt to amend the sign ordinance to bar \\"other matter\\" (the lechis) from being affixed to utility poles. The \\"other matter\\" language would have imitated the 2015 changes to the Upper Saddle River sign law which had followed Minichetti informing the borough council about the plans for the eruv, and was withdrawn, according to Hermansen, lest Mahwah's motives be misinterpreted. The vote to repeal the park ban was unanimous, with one council member absent. After the vote, Laforet called the ordinances \\"ill-advised\\" before being silenced by the council. He resumed outside the council chamber and disclosed that the members could have faced prosecution. \\"They are hiding from you that if they failed to do so, the Attorney General can come into Mahwah to press civil or criminal bias charges. For people who did a lot of shouting, and shouting down the past several months, they are strangely quiet about that.\\" The Upper Saddle River lawsuit was scheduled for argument before Judge John Michael Vazquez of the federal court for New Jersey. When he convened that hearing on January 9, 2018, rather than hear the lawyers argue the positions set forth in the legal briefs, Judge Vazquez told them his views. He questioned whether the borough had consistently enforced the ordinance, as plaintiffs' lawyers had discovered a number of signs and even mailboxes attached to utility poles, that Upper Saddle River had not taken down. The judge voiced his skepticism that the 2015 sign ordinance had been passed because of a contentious municipal election the previous year, as the borough maintained, and indicated that he was inclined to believe it was passed because of the eruv. He urged Upper Saddle River to try to settle the case, and to do so in coordination with the other two municipalities‚Äîhe was also presiding judge in those cases. On January 30, 2018, the Mahwah council voted 5‚Äì2 to accept a negotiated settlement of the eruv litigation, despite some residents who urged the council to fight all the way to the Supreme Court. Council President Hermansen supported the deal as the best possible outcome, \\"We're trying to do the right thing. This is a good town with good people, and we're making this decision for good people.\\" He wrote on Facebook that Mahwah \\"should be known more for our open space, parks and our overall community than the negative comments made about our residents from outsiders.\\" The terms of the settlement were not announced at that meeting as the deal was still pending agreement by the plaintiffs, but were disclosed the following day. The eruv would remain, but the lechis were to be painted to match the pole, or replaced with ones of that color, The township was to pay the association $10,000 or such other sum as mutually agreed for legal fees. The association was allowed to expand the eruv, but was to consult with the council before doing so. On February 7, a public meeting that was called for that day to discuss the terms of the settlement was postponed to a future date on the advice of the township's attorneys. Montvale also undertook negotiations with the eruv association plaintiffs. Some Montvale residents sought to minimize the land covered by the eruv within the borough by having the boundary run through backyards close to the state line, but the consent of all landowners could not be obtained. On February 13, the Montvale council voted to approve a settlement whereby the eruv boundary would be placed on streets in the northern part of the borough, with efforts to be made to reroute it through private land. Montvale was to pay the eruv association attorneys at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP $10,000 towards legal costs and be shielded from further lawsuits from it for two years. Yehudah Buchweitz, an attorney for the eruv association, stated: \\"Our lawsuit against Montvale was filed to permit an eruv in a small portion of Montvale, so families could enjoy the same religious freedom as so many others throughout Bergen and Rockland counties and beyond. This settlement preserves and protects the people's right to have an eruv.\\" A map showing the eruv boundary's route through Montvale was posted on the borough website on March 1, 2018. A telephone pole with black lechis, Upper Saddle River. Seen in September 2018. After a closed-door meeting, the Upper Saddle River Borough Council voted on January 15 to attempt to reach a settlement with the plaintiffs. On February 21, the borough announced over its emergency notification system that it had reached a tentative agreement whereby the eruv boundary would be run along the roads until it could be relocated as close to the state line as possible. The borough stated that the agreement was being entered into \\"because of a variety of reasons outside of the Borough‚Äôs control, including the recent settlements by Mahwah and Montvale\\". The borough agreed to pay $75,000 towards the eruv association's legal costs. The agreement went into force on April 5, 2018. Under the agreement, 12 poles are to be erected on the municipal right-of-way to allow the eruv boundary to run on a shortened route through the borough, close to the state line. The lechis were to be made of black plastic, and the eruv association was not allowed to not ask for a change of route for three years. On February 15, 2018, Judge Vazquez accepted the Mahwah and Montvale settlements, and on April 19, that of Upper Saddle River. He retained continuing jurisdiction over the matters, and granted permission for them to be re-opened if a dispute was to arise. A temporary eruv boundary was run across the original Upper Saddle River route, pending a final routing. On July 17, 2018, Upper Saddle River posted maps and stated that work on implementing the settlement would occur over the following several weeks. A lechi from the extended eruv rises above a sign urging Mayor Laforet's recall, Mahwah. Seen in February 2018. In September 2018, a settlement between the Attorney General and Mahwah was announced. The township was to repeal the two controversial ordinances and agreed not to enact the new sign ordinance and to notify the Attorney General of any proposed legislation on these subjects for the following four years. The mayor and council were to issue a joint statement affirming that the existing sign ordinance, and those dealing with parks and recreation, would be enforced in a nondiscriminatory manner.

A clerk by trade, he rose through the secret police as the Romanian Communist Party consolidated its hold on power between 1944 and 1947, while from 1948 through 1952, he played an important role as an officer in the new Securitate. Subsequently, arrested as part of a wider purge, he was released after an investigation lasting over two years, but never regained his earlier prestige. Late in life, he left his native country for Israel and, later, Canada. Biography =Beginnings and detention= Born into a Jewish family in Tecuci, his parents were Olga and Sache, a small businessman.Oprea, p.131 He completed three grades of secondary school and two of commercial school,Muraru, p.170 becoming a clerk and an accountant. His first job was in 1927 with the Gala»õi branch of Banque Belge pour l'√âtranger. His uncle, a grain wholesaler, then hired him as an accountant. In 1932, he was drafted into the Romanian Army and assigned to a Gala»õi cavalry regiment. Moving to the national capital Bucharest, he first worked at a store owned by his cousin, in 1938 starting work at the warehouse of a silk factory. That year, he married the accountant Liza Marcusohn. Also in 1938, he was fired from the factory as a result of anti-Semitic legislation passed by the Goga-Cuza government. He managed to buy a supply of defective towels from the factory, and the couple lived off their sale until the end of the year. In early 1939, borrowing from wealthy relatives, they bought two sewing machines and one for stitching buttonholes. Inside their residence, they opened a small workshop for producing men's clothing.Oprea, p.131-32 In January 1940, Liza was hired as a typist at the Soviet commercial office in Bucharest, with Mi»ôu, upon her recommendation, soon following as an accountant. The couple were arrested in June 1941, at the start of Operation Barbarossa, and interned at T√¢rgu Jiu camp. There, they quickly fell into the communist circle.Oprea, p.132 =Secret police years= Dulgheru became a prot√©g√© of Soviet agent Vania Didenco (alias Ion Vidra»ôcu). Biografiile nomenklaturii , at the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile site He joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in August 1944, after it became legal as a result of the King Michael Coup. The same year, he joined a communist paramilitary organization, the auxiliary bureau of patriotic fighting forces. There, he was responsible for identifying opponents of the PCR, in particular members of the Iron Guard who were still free. In April 1945, he entered the Siguran»õa secret police within the Interior Ministry (MAI) and was assigned to the detectives' corps. It was at this point that he changed his name. In 1947, he was named to the committee for repatriations from Germany. From 1948, after the establishment of a Communist regime, until 1952, he headed the MAI's penal investigation unit, and had the rank of colonel. Within this post, he coordinated all the activities of Securitate investigators within Romania. In essence, in the view of historian Marius Oprea, he supervised the entire series of tortures and abuses that took place in its investigation chambers during the secret police's first four years. Moreover, together with Alexandru Nicolschi, he undertook the deportation of tens of thousands of individuals into labor camps. Unlike his more brutish colleagues, he was cultivated, attractive and well-dressed, perceived as spontaneous and elegant, rarely resorting to physical abuse during interrogations. His office was handsomely furnished, as recalled by Lena Constante, who was interrogated there.Oprea, p.132-33 =Downfall and later life= He was, at the same time, an NKVD agent, and he held high-level positions within the new Securitate secret police from its beginnings. He helped coordinate the trial against those involved in the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal project's failure and helped investigate Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu. He also investigated a group of financiers tried in 1948, and the Protestant pastor Richard Wurmbrand. After the fall of the Pauker-Luca- Georgescu group, which marked the triumph of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in his power struggle with that faction, Dulgheru was arrested in October 1952. In particular, the arrest of Georgescu, the former Interior Minister, led to a witch-hunt within the Securitate. Dulgheru was a perfect victim: an intellectual who had good relations with the purged officials, as well as a Jew, which facilitated charges of Zionism.Oprea, p.143 Dulgheru was under investigation for two years and three months. While detained, he was allowed plenty of food, clean clothes and medicines, and was not tortured. Freed in January 1954 when the charge of deviationism could not be proved,Oprea, p.140 he was reduced to the rank of a common soldier. In 1968, at which point he was supervisor of the Bucharest sanitation workers, the Stoica-Patiline»õ committee investigated abuses he had committed, but he was not punished.Oprea, p.141 He emigrated to Israel with his family in the early 1980s, and was still alive a decade later. In 2009, the High Court of Cassation and Justice ruled that military prosecutors should open proceedings against Dulgheru for his involvement in the 1948 death under torture of Alcibiades Diamandi; investigators began probing the case in 2013.

It introduced a new iconography to Nikolaidis' work and contains several elements somewhat resembling the thriller genre and post-apocalyptic science fiction. The film has an elaborate yet simple script of strongly contrasting moods. The film's dialogue contains excerpts taken from published works authored by Daphne du Maurier, Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler, and Herman Raucher. It received the Best Director Award and the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award at the Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema in October 1987, where Dinos Katsouridis also won the Best Cinematographer Award and Marie-Louise Bartholomew also won the Best Art Director Award. The film went on further to be officially selected for screening at Fantasporto in February 1989 where it was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award and it was also officially selected for screening at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in January 1987 where it was nominated for the Grand Prize. Plot A lonely and perplexed woman, played by future Nikolaidis mainstay Michele Valley, wanders through the ruins of a destroyed and deserted city in a post-apocalyptic era. She wonders whatever happened and where did all the residents disappear to. She does not remember much about herself, including even her own name, where is she supposed to be going, and whether she ever had any relatives. Her searches throughout the city are not successful and no one can help her. Memories of the past come in the form of dreams and bestow upon her guidance and hope; all alone, in a mysterious and abandoned place, she finds the travel difficult. The windows and doors of the city's buildings are all open and the city is almost entirely silent, a silence violated only by the sounds coming out of a film theater in which the protagonist finds herself at one instance. However, the reigning silence is only an appearance, for at times the city comes alive and becomes a dangerous place. Carelessness and gullibility can cost lives. The woman finally meets a lonely man in despair, employed as a guard, eventually finding with him the ultimate link between love and death (a theme which Nikolaidis explored in his later films).

Other practical types of single frequency laser diodes include DFB lasers and external cavity diode lasers. A fourth type, the cleaved-coupled-cavity laser has not proven to be commercially viable. VCSELs are also single frequency devices. The DBR laser structure is fabricated with surface features that define a monolithic, single mode ridge waveguide that runs the entire length of the device. A resonant cavity is defined by a highly reflective DBR mirror on one end, and a low reflectivity cleaved exit facet on the other end. Within the cavity is a gain ridge portion, where current is injected to produce a single spatial lasing mode. The DBR mirror is designed to reflect only a single longitudinal mode. As a result, the laser operates on a single spatial and longitudinal mode. The laser emits from the exit facet opposite the DBR end. The DBR is continuously tunable over approximately a 2 nm range by changing current or temperature. The temperature coefficient is approximately 0.07 nm/K, and the current coefficient is approximately 0.003 nm/mA. DBR lasers are stable, low noise optical sources. When operated with a low noise power supply at constant temperature, edge emitting DBR lasers have a linewidth of less than 10 MHz. Power levels typically can run up to several hundred milliwatts. DBR lasers are often confused with DFB lasers. Both exhibit narrow linewidth and stable single frequency operation. However, the location of the feedback element (the grating) causes the DBR and the DFB to have distinct operational characteristics. Because the grating is distributed all along the gain region in the DFB, the grating and gain region experience similar conditions as the device is tuned with current and temperature. The DFB can exhibit a continuous tuning range of 2 nm or more. However, over a sufficiently long current or temperature range, the emitted wavelength will suddenly jump to a longer wavelength (red shift), leaving a gap in the tuning range. Because the DBR laser has a passive grating region, its tuning characteristic is different from that of the gain region. Increasing current in the gain region causes a red shift in laser output due to heating. The reflectivity curve of the passive grating does not change. As a result, the grating will experience loss of reflectivity at the longer wavelengths, and eventually will induce a discontinuous blue shift in the wavelength to find a higher gain mode. The blue shift ensures that the wavelength characteristic will repeat itself with increasing temperature or current, and no gaps will occur in the tuning.

Born in Kentucky, Kinney came to the Illinois Territory at a young age with his family. In 1809, he founded a successful dry goods store on the road between the towns of Belleville and Lebanon. This made him a prominent citizen of St. Clair County, and Kinney was elected to the Illinois Senate when the body was formed in 1818. In 1826, Kinney was elected Lieutenant Governor under Ninian Edwards. However, Kinney developed a pattern of financial mismanagement during this term that would haunt him for the rest his life. Twice an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Illinois, Kinney was named president of the state's board of public works. Kinney nearly bankrupted the state by funding ambitious projects in the wake of the Panic of 1837. The board was liquidated and the state was in the process of suing Kinney when he died in 1843. Biography William Kinney was born near Louisville, Kentucky in 1781. In 1793, he came to the Indiana Territory with his family, settling in New Design in what is now Monroe County, Illinois. Kinney married when he was nineteen and his wife helped to teach him how to read. In 1803, he built an farm northeast of Belleville, on the road to the town of Lebanon. He purchased surrounding land until his estate measured . In 1809, a merchant named VonPhul from St. Louis, Missouri sold Kinney some bolts of cotton cloth with the intent of resale. Kinney established a dry goods store, and it eventually grew to become one of the largest in the area. Kinney converted to the Baptist Church and became a preacher. When the state of Illinois was approved in 1818, Kinney was elected to the 1st Illinois General Assembly in the state senate, serving a two-year term. He was re-elected to the body in 1822 for the 3rd General Assembly. In 1826, Kinney was elected the third Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, serving with Governor Ninian Edwards. Kinney struggled to balance his political and mercantile responsibilities and found himself in financial ruin by the end of his four-year term. Kinney was an ardent supporter of slavery and was able to maintain a sustainable lifestyle using slave labor in his orchards. He was an early leader in the state's Democratic-Republican Party, then became a Democrat. He ran for Governor of Illinois in 1830, but was defeated by John Reynolds. He again ran for the position in 1834, but was defeated by Joseph Duncan. In 1836, the state legislature elected Kinney to the Illinois Board of Public Works, who promptly named him president of the organization. He made many poor investments, worsened by the Panic of 1837, and nearly bankrupted the state. However, Kinney was credited for helping to convince Lyman Trumbull to come from Connecticut to join the board; Trumbull would become one of the most prominent politicians in the state's history. The board was liquidated and the state sued Kinney for concealing funds. =Personal life= Kinney had three sons and three daughters. Eldest son Samuel graduated from the United States Military Academy but died of consumption. Second son George D. served in the Black Hawk War but died shortly afterward. Youngest son William C. was a successful lawyer in Belleville who married the daughter of Elias Kane and served in the Illinois House of Representatives. Kinney's eldest daughter married politician John Thomas, who served in both state houses. Kinney died on October 1, 1843 at his home in St. Clair County. Kinney was buried in Shiloh Valley Cemetery in Shiloh, Illinois. Early Oregon politician Robert Crouch Kinney was his nephew.

The book containing this chapter is anonymous but early Christian tradition affirmed that Luke composed this book as well as the Gospel of Luke. This chapter records the aftermath of a healing by Simon Peter and his preaching in Solomon's Portico, that Sanhedrin arrested the apostles, but had to let them go.Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an abbreviated Bible commentary. 23rd edition. Zondervan Publishing House. 1962. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek and is divided into 37 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Papyrus 8 (4th century; extant verses 31‚Äì37) * Codex Bezae (~400) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 1‚Äì2) * Codex Laudianus (~550) =Old Testament references= * : Psalm * : Psalm * : Psalm =New Testament references= * : ; ; ; Conflicting reactions (4:1‚Äì4) Peter's speech (Acts 3) was interrupted by the temple authorities who come to silence the apostles, but behind the scenes, more people join the church. Arrest and trial (4:5‚Äì12) The apostles spent a night in jail (verse 5) and brought before a full session of Sanhedrin the next morning. =Verse 10= :[Simon Peter said]: \\"let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole.\\", NKJV Peter replies to the question of the council (verse 7) on the origin of the healing power by identifying it with Jesus Christ of Nazareth. =Verse 11= :[Simon Peter said]: \\"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\\" NKJV Citing Psalm 118:22. =Verse 12= :[Simon Peter said]: \\"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\\" NKJV In his last sentence, Peter \\"goes further than anything he has yet said: Christ is the only mean of salvation.\\" Deliberation of the council (4:13‚Äì22) Here Luke gives a glimpse of \\"the inner workings of the Sanhedrin\\", especially the elitist perspective: perceiving the apostles in verse 13 as 'uneducated and untrained' (not the sense of illiterate but the sense of not having the education level of the elders and the scribes) as well as displaying 'us' and 'them' attitude toward 'the people' (verses 16, 17, 21). A prophetic prayer (4:23‚Äì31) This section gives a glimpse of \\"the apostolic circle at prayer\\", and this particular prayer provides a \\"theological framework\\" for \\"legitimate exercise of free speech in the face of a tyrannical abuse of authority\\" (verse 29). Common church life (4:32‚Äì37) A slightly more detailed than in 2:44-45, it notes how money raised from the property sale was \\"channelled through the apostles\\" (verse 35) to emphasize \\"the sense of centralized authority\\". =Verses 32‚Äì35= : All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God‚Äôs grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles‚Äô feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. NIV =Verses 36‚Äì37= :And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. NKJV * \\"Barnabas\\" would later play an important role in the early ministry of Apostle Paul (; Acts 11), and, \\"with typically Lukan economy\\" of literary device, is introduced here as a character who displays \\"a positive example of the ideal use of wealth\\". *\\"Son of Encouragement\\": The Greek text , hyios paraklƒìse≈çs can also mean \\"son of consolation\\". One theory is that this is from the Aramaic , ', meaning 'son (of) consolation'. Another is that it is related to the Hebrew word nabƒ´ (◊†◊ë◊ô◊ê, Aramaic nebƒ´) meaning \\"prophet\\". from Thayer's Greek Lexicon and Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible.

Melby, who used the basement and ground floor for his furniture-making business, as well as his undertaking services. During this time, the second and third floors were used as a hospital which specialized in treating injuries and illnesses of mill and lumber workers who resided in the local area. This was an attractive proposition for these workers, who they were said to have been offered a $10-per-year health plan. Throughout the mid-1900s, the building was occupied by a variety of different tenants. Frank's Plumbing occupied the building beginning in the early 1940s.Minnesota Historical Society - Frank's Plumbing Building The second and third floor were purposed as a local boarding house, where people could rent a room by the week.

History In the early 14th century Robert the Bruce granted the lands, then known as Loscraigie, to Patrick de Monte Alto. Mowat is the anglicisation of de Monte Alto. The Balquholly name was adopted some time before the 16th century. Records indicate there was a castle (spelt Balquholy) on the lands in the early 1500s, but it is likely it may have an earlier date. Purchased by Alexander Duff of Hatton in 1709 ‚Äì although the contracts were not finalised until 1729 ‚Äì ownership has remained with members of the family into the 21st century. Mansion house Construction of the present castellated mansion began in 1812 and was completed by 1814; it was at this time the name was changed to Hatton Castle. It has a round tower at each corner and incorporates sections of the ancient building. The stone-built mansion has three storeys plus a basement and an attic. A wine cellar and gun room are in the basement. The ground floor hall has a glass cupola set above a stone staircase that provides access to the first floor. There are two bedrooms on the first floor and seven on the second floor; the attic contains four additional bedrooms, a bathroom and storage space. The mansion was designated a category A listed building by Historic Scotland on 28 November 1972.

He was educated at Harvard University and Trinity College, Cambridge before working at Dartmouth College and the University of Missouri. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959-1960 for which he spent seven years researching his biography of William III of England.Stephen B. Baxter, William III (London: Longmans, 1966), backflap His biography of William III remains the standard scholarly study, and projects a highly favorable view of the king Of England, 1689-1702: :William III was the Deliverer of England from the tyranny and arbitrary government of the Stuarts....He repaired and improved an obsolete system of government, and left it strong enough to withstand the stresses of the next century virtually unchanged. The army of Marlborough, and that of Wellington, and to a large extent that of Raglan, was the creation of William III. So too was the independence of the judiciary..... [His government] was very expensive; at their peak the annual expenditures of William III were four times as large as those of James II. This new scale of government was bitterly unpopular. But the new taxes, which were not in fact heavy by comparison with those borne by the Dutch, made England a great power. And they contributed to the prosperity of the country while they contributed to its strength, by the process which is now called 'pump-priming.'
