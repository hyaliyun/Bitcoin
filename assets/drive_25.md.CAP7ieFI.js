Appearing in 49 games, he recorded 61 solo tackles and an interception during his four years with the Commodores.  Professional career = Miami Dolphins  Clarke went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft and was later signed by the Miami Dolphins as a free agent. He played in three preseason games with the Dolphins, but was released from the team on August 26 before the start of the regular season.  BC Lions  The BC Lions signed Clarke in September 2014 to their practice roster. He made his CFL debut against the Ottawa Redblacks on October 11, 2014, recording three special teams tackles. He went on to play one more game for the Lions in his rookie season.

Lawsuit  In October 2014, Clarke was one of ten named plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against several major broadcasting companies and NCAA athletic conferences seeking compensation. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that the images of college athletes in the Football Bowl Subdivision and men's basketball Division I were improperly used without permission. While student athletes are required to sign forms allowing the NCAA to \\"generally promote\\" college sporting events, the athletes claimed that this term was overly vague and did not provide permission to commercially use their names or images. The case was dismissed by a judge in June 2015, who ruled that the players' claims were not strong enough to prove they were legally entitled to money from appearing in televised sporting events.

They formed a partnership to trade with the Indians of Florida and the Spanish borderlands on the southern frontier of the British colonies. By 1795 the company had established a monopoly on trade with the Indian tribes of what is now the southeastern United States, sanctioned by successive governors of Spanish Florida. Early years in America Panton, the son of John Panton and Barbara Wemyss, was born on the family farm at the Mains of Aberdour on the south coast of the Moray Firth in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Panton emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina with his countryman, Thomas Forbes, in 1765. He got into the Indian trade as an apprentice with the firm of John Gordon, a Scots immigrant from Aberdeenshire who established a vast trade network in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida during the 1760s. Panton served as Gordon's clerk from 1765 until 1772, when Gordon appointed him one of his attorneys. Forbes was Gordon's maternal nephew. In 1774 Panton and Philip Moore formed a partnership that lasted for several years, and in 1776 Panton started his own trading house with Thomas Forbes in Savannah known as Panton, Forbes and Company. They began to trade with the growing population of white colonists, and speculated in lands, acquiring large tracts in both Carolina and Georgia. Soon after the American revolution broke out, they being determined loyalists, their properties were confiscated. They migrated to East Florida, now a British province and rapidly developing with the infusion of British capital and enterprise, and established themselves on the St. Marys River. In December 1775, the British governor of East Florida, Patrick Tonyn, appointed Panton official trader for the Creek Indians, and in 1778 the British Indian agent, Col. Thomas Brown, charged Panton with responsibility for the giving of presents to the Creeks and Cherokees, a necessary part of diplomacy with the Indian tribes. On l0 January 1783, he received a license signed by Governor Tonyn, Brigadier General Archibald McArthur, commander of British forces in East Florida, and Thomas Brown, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, to carry on trade with the Indians and supply them with British manufactures. Trading in Spanish Florida With the recession of the Floridas to Spain on 20 February 1783, Panton was allowed to remain in the province by agreement between the British officers and Manuel de Z√©spedes, the Spanish governor. He had insinuated himself into the good graces of Z√©spedes, who interceded on his behalf at the Spanish court. By royal orders of the Spanish Crown in March 1786, Panton, Leslie & Company were authorized to continue to trade with the Indians in the Floridas. They did a large mercantile business in St. Augustine, managed by John Leslie, and were generally employed by the Spaniards to furnish goods and lend funds. Some of the partners of the firm were permitted to purchase lands and to hold them in East Florida. John Leslie presented himself on behalf of Panton, Leslie & Co., and declared the four principals of the house to be William Panton and Thomas Forbes, Charles Maclatchy, and himself, and that the company owned 72,820 acres of land in the province. Later in 1783, Panton and William Alexander moved to Nassau in the Bahamas, which then became the center of the firm's operations, where it stored trade items in large warehouses. Panton, Leslie & Company headquarters in Pensacola In April 1785, Panton and John Forbes arrived in Spanish Pensacola with a hastily loaded cargo of goods from Nassau. They established the new house headquarters in the settlement as its volume of trade exceeded that of the St. Augustine branch. According to the Spanish census of 1786, Panton, Leslie and Company owned 250 slaves and nineteen separate land grants, most of the slaves working on its plantations and ranches. In February 1789, Panton gained the Choctaw and Chickasaw trade at Mobile with the failure of Mather and Strother, a competitor firm based in New Orleans. By 1795 the company monopolized trade with the Native American tribes in the southeast, its presence reaching northward from Pensacola to Fort San Fernando (formerly known as Chickasaw Bluffs) on the site of present-day Memphis, and westward as far as New Orleans, with posts at Mobile and several locations in Florida, the Bahamas, and around the Caribbean. Largest mercantile company in the Old Southwest View of the north and east sides of the old Panton, Leslie & Company warehouse, converted into a residence for John Innerarity in 1806. The hipped roof building in the left foreground is the kitchen of the William Panton mansion, which was destroyed in a fire in 1848 (courtesy of the Pensacola Historical Society). Panton, Leslie & Company made a fortune in the Indian trade and would become the largest mercantile company on the southern frontier in the 1790s. Working in partnership with Alexander McGillivray, they were able to expand their operations from East Florida and the Bahamas to the Mississippi River. McGillivray, an influential chief of the Upper Creek (Muscogee) towns, was an intimate associate of Panton and is generally considered to have been a silent partner in the firm. Panton had promised him a one-fifth share of the company's profits once it obtained Spanish approval. McGillivray, always sickly, died in 1793, and was buried with Masonic honors in Panton's garden at Pensacola on 18 February of that year. The firm fixed prices to undersell its competitors in Georgia and South Carolina, dispatched agents throughout the Indian country, and carried Spanish government communiques among the tribes. Although Panton, Leslie & Company were a legitimate trading firm, they smuggled goods across the border and manipulated the market to their advantage in other ways, practices probably common to any trading firm operating on the frontier at the time. After the deaths of William Panton and John Leslie, the company was reorganized in 1804 as John Forbes & Company. Death In January 1801, Panton came down with a serious illness at Pensacola, and acting on medical advice to seek a change of climate immediately, he sailed for Havana attended by his physician, Dr. Reeves Fowler, on the company schooner Shark. They left in haste, even though his letters of recommendation had not yet arrived. Unfortunately, the Cuban authorities refused to allow him to disembark without such papers, on account of the ongoing war between Spain and Great Britain. He continued toward Nassau, but died at sea on 26 February, and was buried at Great Harbour Cay, the major island of the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.Coker, 1976, p.19Coker Watson1986, pp. 234‚Äì235 NotesExternal links Category:People from Florida Category:People of Spanish Florida Category:1740s births Category:1801 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"William Panton"},{"id":"47222322","text":"cur Mat√∫≈° Kira (born 10 October 1994) is a Slovak professional footballer who currently plays for FC Ko≈°ice in 2.

Zern was a popular columnist at Field & Stream Magazine. Early life Zern was born in Farmington, West Virginia. His father was a professor at the School of Mines at West Virginia University and a mine inspector Zern's father taught him flyfishing, and brought him along on mine inspections. On these visits, Zern saw the environmental damage of water pollution from mine tailings. A Boy Scout, Zern learned about hunting squirrels with a .22 rifle. Zern attended Pennsylvania State University, graduating with a degree in English literature in 1932. Zern then took the $400 he had earned writing for the college newspaper and went to Paris, with the aim of writing a novel. After four months, Zern returned to the United States, having failed to write the novel. He then worked as a merchant seaman for 18 months. After his time at sea, Zern returned home and got married. Writing career Living in Philadelphia, Zern became an advertising man and cartoonist. He produced a long series of humorous promotional ads and cartoons for Nash Motors. After hearing Zern complain about the quality of sporting magazines, she suggest that he contribute articles himself. He wrote an article for Field and Stream and received $60, which was about twice his weekly income. He wrote a second article for them and received $75. Zern decided to become a full-time freelance writer. After submitting several humorous articles to Collier's, a former editor there suggested that he write a book about fishing. Zern reportedly said, \\"To Hell With Fishing,\\" and that became the book title. Published in 1945, To Hell With Fishing sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Regarding book, Zern was quoted as saying, \\"I don't think many fishermen bought it; people bought it to give to fishermen.\\" Continuing to write books and advertising copy, Zern became a contributing editor of the new Sports Illustrated magazine for four years. He was published in True, the travel section of the Sunday New York Times, The Flyfisher, Audubon, and other publications. In November, 1958, Field and Stream first published Zern's his \\"Exit Laughing\\" column. It remained a magazine feature for over 30 years .Jim Casada, Ed Zern: Laughter With A Lesson; Fly Fishing News, December, 1987-January, 1988. Archived at http://edzern.com/?cat=42 Conservation activities Zern was a member of many conservation groups, including the Theodore Gordon Flyfishers (he was a past president), the Atlantic Salmon Federation, and the Boone and Crockett Club, an organization started by Theodore Roosevelt and others for the preservation of big game animals.New York Times, obituary of Ed Zern, March 27, 1994 https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/sports/ed-zern-83-writer-for-field-stream- and-conservationist.html Zern was deeply involved in environmental issues and conservation, but excused his less-than-strident advocacy of these causes in print, saying, \\"I have problems being serious.\\" He detested \\"game hogs\\" (hunters and fishers who take more than the limit), those who pollute the air and water, and he thought that a strong conservation ethic is about the finest trait any sportsman can possess. In 1953, Zern created an annual Conservation Awards Program, originally sponsored by American Motors Corporation and later sponsored by Gulf Oil Corporation. The awards were presented annually to 10 professional conservationists employed by nonprofit organizations, and to 10 persons whose conservation efforts were voluntary. As of 1983, Zern himself was still the Program Director for the award.Ed Zern, Gulf Honors Conservationists, Gulf Oil Newsletter(?), 1983, reprinted at http://edzern.com/?p=91 At the time of his death, it was known as the Chevron/Times Mirror Magazines Conservation Award. Humor and style According to Brook Zern, his father's absurd humor showed a \\"well-disguised intellectualism ... The main reason that Ed Zern is not listed up there with S. J. Perelman, Robert Benchley, E. B. White and Peter De Vries is because he wrote for the sporting set at Field & Stream instead of the smart set at The New Yorker.\\"Brook Zern, Introduction to \\"The Best of Ed Zern: Fifty Years of Fishing and Hunting from One of America's Best-Loved Outdoor Humorists\\"; Lyons Press, 2001. Taken from http://edzern.com/?p=252 in his articles for Field and Stream, Zern would casually mention Wagner (comparing his operas to big game hunting), Bach (trout fishing with a dry fly), Proust and Joyce. He once included an offhand \\"book review\\" of \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\": > Although written many years ago, Lady Chatterley's Lover has just been > reissued by Grove Press, and this fictional account of the day-to-day life > of an English gamekeeper is still of considerable interest to outdoorminded > readers, as it contains many passages on pheasant raising, the apprehending > of poachers, ways of controlling vermin, and other chores and duties of the > professional gamekeeper. Unfortunately one is obliged to wade through many > pages of extraneous material in order to discover and savor these sidelights > on the management of a Midland shooting estate, and in this reviewer's > opinion this book can not take the place of J. R. Miller's Practical > Gamekeeping. In To Hell With Hunting, Zern said that he once had to explain to a visitor what \\"restricted\\" meant on the signs for hunting and fishing lodges. \\"'It means,' I told him, 'that if you are a game-hog and a spoil-sport and a discourteous scoundrel and a Gentile, you are welcome to stay there, and if you are a true sportsman and a conservationist and a gentleman and a Jew, you are not welcome.'\\" Zern continued, editorially: \\"Personally, I believe wholeheartedly in \\"discrimination\\"‚Äî against game-hogs, fish-hogs, violators of the written and the unwritten laws of sportsmanship, conservation, decency, and courtesy. But I don't want to be welcomed to a hunting or fishing camp or hotel simply because I am a Pennsylvania Dutchman, and I don't want some of the finest sportsmen I know to be turned away because they are Jews.\\"Ed Zern, To Hell With Hunting, 1946, extracted at http://edzern.com/?cat=55 In his regular \\"Exit Laughing\\" column, Zern dealt with such absurdities as using hemp seeds for bait in England. Noting that marijuana impairs the faculties, he asked, \\"Is he fearful lest the local perch should fail their bar exams, or the pike flunk their courses in nuclear physics? If the I.Q. of an wandle barbel or roach or tench should slip from 1.6, which it normally is, to 0.7, for instance, I doubt the tight little island would get appreciably looser.\\" In the same column, Zern mentioned a fellow who dreamed he was a pileated woodpecker and awoke with a hangover (leaving the reader to imagine the effect of having a hangover and knocking one's head against a tree to find food. He told another \\"tall tale\\" of a fisherman who pulled on his line so hard that \\"the fish was turned completely inside out.\\"Ed Zern, \\"How To Train Gun Dogs,\\" Exit Laughing, Field and Stream, February 1975, reprinted at http://edzern.com/?p=250 Family and death Zern died on March 25, 1994, of Parkinson's disease. Typically for him, he made jokes about his ailment, saying, \\"I shake a lot. But it keeps my wristwatch wound.\\" Andrew H. Malcolm, 77 Years of Going Fishing and Lying, The New York Times, 1993, reprinted at http://edzern.com/?p=106 He also claimed that his shaking hand caused a tied fly to more closely resemble a real insect when in the water. Zern was survived by his companion, Sandra Weiner; his daughter, Erica; son, Brook; brother, Gordon; and two granddaughters. Legacy When Zern retired from Field and Stream in 1993, the magazine's managing editor, Maggie Nichols, said, \\"No one could possibly take Ed's place.\\" \\"Exit Laughing\\" disappeared from the back page of the magazine. However, \\"out of respect for sales\\", his old columns began to be reprinted.

She herself was known to be bisexual. Following the 1985 Brixton uprising both her shop and bar failed and she found herself on the dole and unable to afford a birthday card for a friend so she drew one. Alcock described this realization of her knack for drawing: ‚ÄúI went mad scribbling on anything I laid my hands on,‚Äùshe explains, ‚Äúfriends admired what I had done and began to bring me materials to use, that is how I started.‚Äù Monika Kinley, one of the country's leading advocates of Outsider Art, describes her as \\"a visual poet\\".

It housed on average four hundred children annually and was mostly managed by women. Its first location was on Fifth Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets in Midtown Manhattan, a four-story building with two wings. It later moved to Upper Manhattan and then to Riverdale in the Bronx.  History  The Colored Orphan Asylum was founded in 1836 by three Quakers; Anna and Hanna Shotwell and Mary Lindley Murray. It was one of the first of its kind in the United States to take in black children whose parents had died, or were not able to take care of them. Prior to its founding, orphaned black children were housed in jails or worked as beggars or chimney sweeps as orphanages refused to take them. The orphanage initially offered schooling only for infants, feeling that their wards would not advance far in society due to being Black and orphans. Older children were bound by indentured servitude in which they were contracted to families, both Black and white, to learn a trade or skill until age 21. The families, in turn, paid a small fee to the Colored Orphan Asylum for the services which were placed in the bank for when the child left the institution. By 1897, schooling was increased until grade six and sent several students to the Hampton Institute for further study. In 1918 schooling was increased until grade eight and the indenture system evolved into a loose foster care system in which the child was to be incorporated into the family and continue their studies. In 1846 Dr. James McCune Smith, the country's first licensed African American medical doctor, became the orphanage's medical director. The orphanage moved several times in Manhattan.  1863 riots  In March 1863, conscription in the United States became stricter, and the federal government used a lottery system to choose citizens for the draft. Those chosen could hire a substitute or pay the government, but most working-class men could not afford substitution, while black men were ineligible for the draft (they were not considered citizens of the United States at the time). Working-class white males, furious about the federal draft laws, rioted and attacked federal buildings and black neighborhoods. The Colored Orphan Asylum was burned down by Irish mobs on July 13, 1863, during the first day of the New York Draft Riots. A policeman was killed while leading the children out the back door to escape. Rebuilding The asylum was rebuilt by the Quakers in 1867 on 143rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The operation moved to a new building in 1907, in Riverdale, Bronx. At the new site, the orphanage adopted a new plan to house its wards in cottages, with 25 children and a housemother in each cottage. The new plan was received favorably and encouraged ownership and self respect in the children. In 1910, the asylum purchased a farm in Duchess County for boys to learn practical skills. In 1944, the asylum was renamed the Riverdale Children's Association and changed itself into a foster care agency by 1946. The building later became the Hebrew Home for the Aged.

Chinn, MVD technique of surface modification, AICHE Annual meeting 2004, November 8, Austin, TX is the gas- phase reaction between surface reactive chemicals and an appropriately receptive surface. Often bi-functional silanes are used in which one termination of the molecule is reactive. For example, a functional chlorosilane (R-Si-Cl3) can react with surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) resulting a radicalized (R) deposition on the surface. The advantage of a gas phase reaction over a comparable liquid phase process is the control of moisture from the ambient environment, which often results in cross polymerization of the silane leading to particulates on the treated surface. Often a heated sub- atmospheric vacuum chamber is used to allow precise control of the reactants and water content. Additionally the gas phase process allows for easy treatment of complex parts since the coverage of the reactant is generally diffusion limited. Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors often use molecular vapor deposition as a technique to address stiction and other parasitic issues relative to surface-to-surface interactions.

The building served as primary residence of the Church of Ireland Archbishops of Armagh for over two hundred years, from 1770 to 1975, and thereafter as headquarters of Armagh City and District Council from then until April 2015 when that local authority was replaced following the reform of local government in Northern Ireland in that year. The Palace was built when then Archbishop Richard Robinson sought to relocate the principal residence of the archbishops from Drogheda to the titular city of his office. Thomas Cooley undertook the design of the initial building and Francis Johnston was responsible for designing an additional floor at a later stage. The palace currently sits at the centre of the Palace Demesne Public Park, and serves as the office of the Lord Mayor of the new Armagh, Banbridge, and Craigavon Borough. The building became protected as a Grade A listed building (HB 15/18/016) in 1975. History Archbishop Robinson, who commissioned the Palace Richard Robinson was elected Archbishop of Armagh in 1765, which brought with it the Primacy of the Church of Ireland, and was at once dissatisfied with the modest residence provided on English Street, as well as the lack of improvement in the ancient Irish ecclesiastical capital generally. The Archbishop‚Äôs Palace was constructed as part of Robinson‚Äôs project to revistalise the old city generally upon his succeeding to the See of Armagh. Thomas Cooley undertook the design of the initial two-storey building, which was 7 bays wide by 4 bays deep, and Francis Johnston was responsible for designing an additional floor in the 1820s for Archbishop John George de la Poer Beresford. The house and its walled demesne were referred to by Inglis in 1834 as Following the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, Archbishop Knox sought to ensure that the palace and its grounds could continue to be used in perpetuity, as they were no longer being able to rely on tithe income for such purposes. The palace ceased to be the residence of the archbishop, during the tenure of Archbishop Simms, in the 1970s. From 1975 to 2015, the building served as the headquarters for Armagh City and District Council until April 2015 when that local authority was replaced following the reform of local government in Northern Ireland in that year. Since April 2015 the palace has served as the office of the Lord Mayor of the new Armagh, Banbridge, and Craigavon Borough. Grounds=Features The palace is surrounded by grassland to the North, and mixed woodland (largely mature sycamore trees) to the south. There are some 19th century exotic trees near the Palace while a golf course and belt of protective woodland make up the north eastern and north sections of the park. Notable man-made features of the estate include the following: * A walled garden is at the north end, with a garden house (HB 15/18/014), not cultivated at present; * A 19th century glasshouse (HB 15/18/020) and ice house to the west of the Palace (HB 15/18/015); * The stables and coach yard (HB 15/18/018), which now serve as a visitor‚Äôs centre; * Ruins of a Franciscan Friary, (SMR ARM 12:16) and a Holy Well dedicated to Saint Brigid (SMR ARM 12:17). Rokeby Obelisk Atop the high-point of the Palace grounds, Knox‚Äôs hill, stands the Rokeby Obelisk erected in 1782-83, at the southern end of the park. This feature was constructed at the instigation of Archbishop Robinson at a time of severe distress in Armagh City, with employment afforded to those who could not find it elsewhere. The Obelisk‚Äôs name comes from Rokeby Hall, country seat of Robinson‚Äôs father, Sir Thomas Robinson, in the North Riding of Yorkshire and subject of Sir Walter Scott‚Äôs epic poem Rokeby. It is dedicated by Robinson to Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland 1763‚Äì1765 as Northumberland had been instrumental in securing the Archbishopric of Armagh for Robinson, who prior to that had been Bishop of Kildare. Both the Northumberland family‚Äôs and the Royal coat of arms adorn the pedestal, whilst armorial bearings associated with Robinson are detailed on the shaft, as well as his motto, Non Nobis solum sed toti mundo nati.George Newenham Wright, ‚Äò‚ÄôA New and Comprehensive Gazetteer, Volume 1‚Äô‚Äô (1834), London, p.259 Standing 113 feet tall, the Rokeby Obelisk has been awarded ‚ÄúGrade B‚Äù listed status with designation HB15/18/021.

He confesses to Vilma that he killed Carl and begs her forgiveness, but she refuses. For his desertion, John is court-martialed with Jerry, his defense attorney, unsuccessfully defending him. Despondent and apathetic, he is found guilty and receives a dishonorable discharge and a sentence of hard labor. Peace finally comes and John goes to visit the Walden estate, now turned into a home for war orphans. As Vilma sits by the pool, she sees John's reflection beside hers, and the reunited couple embrace.

He is a Canadian-educated Mechanical Engineer, and former school director. Khaled was a staffer, bureaucrat, and civil servant of the democratically elected government led by Mohamed Morsi in Egypt between (30 June 2012 and July 3, 2013). Though the government was chosen by the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), Khaled is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Khaled was forcibly detained by the Egyptian military On July 3, 2013 along with the president and eight other government aides. Khaled remained in an unknown military location for five and a half months, during which time the Egyptian regime refused to acknowledge that it was holding Khaled or to confirm his whereabouts, putting him outside the protection of the law. Khaled was transferred to Torah Prison (Scorpion Wing) on December 17, 2014 and held in solitary confinement for nine months. On October 26, 2014, Khaled continued his detention in a private hospital for three months due to injuries sustained as a result of the extreme conditions of his confinement. As a result of efforts spearheaded by his Canadian wife Sarah Attia with the Free Khaled Al-Qazzaz Campaign (FreeKQ Campaign), Khaled was released on January 11, 2015. Despite his release and cleared legal position, Khaled had been unable to return to Canada for unknown reasons. Khaled awaited another 19 months for a return to Canada and was in need of immediate medical attention. Toronto-born Sarah Attia and the Free Khaled al- Qazzaz campaign had been calling on Canadian and Egyptian governments as well as the international community to urgently assist in securing Khaled‚Äôs immediate return to Canada. On August 14, 2016, Khaled finally landed back in Toronto after he was abruptly cleared to return to Canada. This ended a three- year ordeal.\\"Khaled Al-Qazzaz back in Toronto after release from Egypt\\", Toronto Star, The Canadian Press. Sept.2, 2016 Shortly after their return, both Khaled and wife Sarah Attia were welcomed by the honorable Minister Stephane Dion and his team at the Global Affairs Canada office in Ottawa. They thanked Minister Dion and his team for the diplomatic leadership shown to bring the family home. The family expressed gratitude to all Canadians, human rights activists, journalists, and government officials who dedicated their time and effort to resolving the ordeals of Canadian families abroad. Presently, both Khaled and Sarah are working actively on the development of their new foundation, the Al-Qazzaz Foundation for Education and Development, where they hope to give back to Canada and the world. The foundation will focus on delivering services and support to disadvantaged communities through innovative online technologies and will launch its first project for Syrian Refugees who have arrived in Canada. By offering cultural awareness, English language services, and mental health support, Sarah and Khaled hope to contribute to the great work the Canadian government started one year ago. Personal life Khaled Al-Qazzaz was born in Cairo, Egypt to Adly Moustafa Al-Qazzaz and Amal Mansour. He has 5 siblings. He is married to Canadian Sarah Attia, whom he met while both were graduate students studying engineering at the University of Toronto. Together, they worked on several campus and community based projects. They married and moved to Cairo in 2005, with plans to return to Canada. They have four children: Abdelrahman, 9, Amena, 7, Fatema, 5, and Tahrir, 3. Education Khaled grew up in the United Arab Emirates and went to the Emirates Private School (British education system), where he completed most of his schooling. Khaled returned to Egypt to do a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering at the American University in Cairo (AUC), where he graduated with honors. He was also a participant in several student clubs and societies at AUC, including the Mechanical Engineering Club, where he served as President, the Volleyball and Rowing teams, where he was captain, the Poetry Society and the Model Arab League. Khaled received the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in volleyball and was nominated for the Parents Association Cup awarded for most active students on campus. Khaled moved to Toronto, Canada in 2000 to do a Master's degree in Mechanical engineering at the University of Toronto (UofT) after receiving a scholarship from UofT. He achieved his degree in 2003. Currently, Khaled is completing his Doctorate of Education from Walden University (an online American University). Canada Khaled met his future wife, Sarah Attia, at the University of Toronto and they worked together on several campus and community-based projects. They married and moved to Cairo in 2005, with plans to return to Canada. Khaled and Sarah have 4 children: Abdelrahman, 9, Amena, 7, Fatema, 5, and Tahrir, 3. During his time at UofT, Khaled led student-run initiatives, such as 'Students for World Justice', which raised awareness about the plights of marginalized and persecuted communities all over the world, the Orphan Sponsorship Program, which raised money for 300 orphans in its first year, and social justice initiatives serving the homeless and poor in their local neighborhoods. Khaled also engaged in interfaith initiatives and activities promoting tolerance and understanding with different communities and societies. Egypt In 2005, Khaled returned to Egypt and began work in the field of education in an International School (Mokatam Language School in Egypt) that runs kindergarten through Grade 12. Khaled joined Mokatam Language School in Egypt in June 2005 as the Director of the International Section, which he co-founded in the same year. Between 2008 and 2012 Khaled received a profit share as part of his new contract. On acceptance of his official government position Khaled gave up his position and share at the school. Since 2012, Khaled has not been involved with the school. His work in education led to his involvement as a volunteer professional member of AdvancED, an international accreditation agency for schools, where he volunteered in professional teams accrediting schools in the Middle East and North Africa region. Political experience During the events of the Egyptian revolution in January 2011, Khaled participated in widespread demonstrations against Egypt's 30-year dictatorship. When the first free presidential elections were announced, Khaled became a volunteer campaigner for the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP). After the FJP won the democratic election in June 2012, Khaled was asked to work for the government as a civil servant in recognition of his international experience gained from his studies abroad. Khaled worked in the secretariat of foreign relations coordinating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs promoting democracy, good governance and working on the human rights portfolio. Human rights work During his term in the Presidential Office, Khaled Al-Qazzaz was directly involved in developing new strategies for democracy. Among these initiatives, Khaled is credited with being the first to initiate a Human Rights Portfolio and desk at the Egyptian Presidency. The human rights initiative had the following mandate: # Evaluate the current situation of human rights in Egypt. # Propose a long term strategy to create a rights environment among the institutions and individuals. # Propose revisions and amendments to laws that are not compatible with human rights. Khaled is credited with taking the following steps related to the human rights mandate in Egypt: # Called for a coordinator for human rights position in the presidential office # Sent a call for rights organizations to send their amendments on the articles of the constitution to be adopted by the presidency # Proposed the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) draft law which was based upon creating a free and encouraging environment for NGOs # Invited human rights organizations into the Presidential Office to engage them in developing the human rights agenda at the Presidency office Women's rights activism Khaled helped lay out the following objectives for the Women‚Äôs Empowerment Portfolio: # Evaluate the current situation of women‚Äôs rights in Egypt. # Propose a long-term strategy to develop opportunities for women and create a model for social justice and empowerment for women in Egypt. Khaled‚Äôs work in the Women‚Äôs Empowerment Portfolio resulted in more than 20 hearing sessions with various women-centred organizations (national and international). He helped launch the Egyptian initiative for ensuring women's rights hosted by the Presidency, which held workshops with stakeholders to formulate a national plan for women rights. Khaled also initiated the process to open a UN Women's Office in Egypt. Education activism Alongside his political involvement, Khaled continued to advocate for investment in education and education reform as a priority for post-revolution Egypt. Khaled was also keen on developing a unique educational system that would be directly relevant to Egyptian students. Khaled‚Äôs vision for education in Egypt included an active role for civil society and the private sector in articulating the policies and priorities for a uniquely Egyptian education system. Regarding the importance of education initiatives in Egypt, Khaled was quoted on the popular radio show ‚ÄúGood Morning Egypt‚Äù as saying: ‚ÄúThere is no nation, among the nations that have succeeded in the last 50- 60 years ‚Äì Japan, Germany, Malaysia ‚Äì all the countries in the East and West, have not advanced economically, or socially, except [and] until they placed education as a clear priority‚Ä¶ It is possible to see a huge renaissance in education within the next year, if all the people work in the same direction‚Äù (Khaled Al-Qazzaz, speaking on \\"Good Morning Egypt\\", February 21, 2012) Imprisonment On July 3, 2013, Al-Qazzaz was forcibly detained by the Egyptian military along with the president and eight other government aides. Khaled remained in an unknown military location for five and a half months, during which time the Egyptian regime refused to acknowledge that it was holding Khaled or to confirm his whereabouts, putting him outside the protection of the law. On December 1, 2013, Human Rights Watch issued a statement accusing the Egyptian government of forcibly disappearing Al-Qazzaz for almost five months. The statement read that Al-Qazzaz ‚Äúremains detained without any legal basis at an undisclosed location.‚Äù Under international law, Khaled's case is one of an enforced disappearance. Enforced disappearance violates many of the rights guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Egypt ratified in 1982, including the requirement to bring detainees promptly before a judge. The 1992 UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, stipulates that detainees must be held in officially recognized places of detention, of which their families must be promptly informed; that they must have access to a lawyer; and that each detention facility must maintain an official up-to-date register of everyone in that facility deprived of their liberty. Solitary Confinement On December 17, 2014 Khaled was transferred to a maximum security prison (Scorpion Wing in Torah Prison) and held in solitary confinement for over nine months. Reports later revealed that Al-Qazzaz was held in solitary confinement in a two by two meter cell in one of Egypt‚Äôs most notorious prisons. Reports in international newspapers have shown the conditions of Al-Qazzaz‚Äôs confinement. The cell was reportedly overrun with insects, while Al-Qazzaz had no access to clean clothes, pen or paper, a way to tell time, or windows. As a result of the harsh conditions of his detainment, Al-Qazzaz‚Äôs health has greatly deteriorated, leaving him with spinal complications and at risk for paralysis. During his confinement, Al- Qazzaz and his lawyers appeared in court on numerous occasions as a part of the legal proceedings to call for an end to his detainment. Many of the court appearances ended with the judge extending Al-Qazzaz‚Äôs detainment for another 45 days for further investigations without legal explanation. Hospitalization and release On October 26, 2014, Khaled was moved to a private hospital where he continued his detention for over three months due to injuries sustained as a result of the extreme conditions of his confinement. On Monday, December 29, 2014, the Attorney General issued an order for Al- Qazzaz‚Äôs release. This meant that investigations with Khaled came to an end and no charges would be issued. Khaled was finally released on January 11, 2015. When Khaled was first detained, the group Friends of Khaled came together to stand with his wife, Sarah Attia, in her efforts to bring her husband back home to Canada. This was the inception of the FreeKQ (Free Khaled al-Qazzaz) Campaign. While Friends of Khaled began as a group of university alumni who knew Khaled while he studied at the University of Toronto. Currently, Friends of Khaled has grown across Canada and internationally to include advocates of human rights. The FreeKQ campaign has led initiatives such as phone call campaigns, letter writing campaigns, petition campaigns, and a ‚Äòpay-it-forward.‚Äô The campaign is still active and information can be found on: https://web.archive.org/web/20150108114802/http://www.freekhaledalqazzaz.com/ Return to education Khaled is currently in Egypt. Though he is legally cleared and is not under any travel bans as confirmed by the Prosecutor General, he has been unable to travel. Khaled‚Äôs legal team in Egypt has been working diligently with local authorities to facilitate his return to Canada. As he awaits the opportunity to return to Canada, he has returned to his Doctorate program at Walden University and re-initiated his work in Education consultancy in Egypt. Statements and interviews Amnesty International has reported that any charges brought against him would be found deliberately fabricated to make him appear guilty. The United Nations‚Äô Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also made it clear that Khaled‚Äôs detention was in violation of Egyptian and International law. Khaled‚Äôs detention did not come through any legal process, let alone one that would be consistent with international standards of due process and individual rights. Press Conferences where human rights activists and leaders have spoken (Monia Mazigh; John Greyson; Alex Neve; Wayne Marston) regarding Khaled have reported consistently that there have never been any charges against Khaled. While in solitary confinement at Tora Prison, Khaled shared a hand-written statement.

Flourishing in the Qing dynasty, but rooted in earlier times, the Jiugongdao developed greatly on Mount Wutai thanks to the efforts of Li Xiangshan, also known as Puji, his name as a Buddhist monk who was close to the Manchu court. With his contribution, Jiugongdao took over more than twenty run down former Buddhist monasteries on Mount Wutai and rebuilt them thanks to the donations of its strong following, especially concentrated in northeast China. The monasteries were reformed into Chinese temples dedicated to indigenous deities and the cosmological Lords of the Five Peaks. The sect also gathered a following among Khorchin Mongols.

Built about 1882 by mining entrepreneur Noah Armstrong to house his race horses, and featuring a -wide indoor circular aisle that was used for exercising horses, it is a National Register of Historic Places property notable for its unique architecture and as the birthplace of the Thoroughbred racehorse, Spokane, winner of the 1889 Kentucky Derby. Background Armstrong had made his fortune in mining, and at one time operated the Hecla Consolidated Mining Company near Glendale, Montana. During that time, he organized horse races in the mining camp, and after leaving the business he obtained property in the Jefferson River valley, near Twin Bridges, and began to raise race horses. He bought the original property from his son, and purchased additional surrounding land until he owned , which he originally named the Doncaster Farm, in honor of the famed English Thoroughbred race horse Doncaster, whom Armstrong admired. The property had previously been called the Jefferson River Ranch. Design The barn was built in 1882 in accordance with a design by Armstrong and is believed to have been built by local craftsmen from area materials. It was three stories high, shaped like a \\"wedding cake,\\" with each floor smaller than the one below it. The first floor is about in diameter, the second floor , and the third floor . The barn stands high from ground level to the top of the ceiling in the third floor. Detail of east doors of barn, said (with some exaggeration) to be able to accommodate a \\"ten-horse wagon laden with hay.\\" The foundation was set on stone abutments quarried from rock in a canyon located about away. Armstrong stated they were driven twelve feet below the water table and set on bedrock. The walls were of wooden planks, made of three thicknesses of lumber deep, said to be insulated with \\"double sheets of building paper\\" between each layer of lumber. The entrance to the barn originally featured an engraved horse scene placed over the door. The barn featured a wide, indoor training track with dirt footing, claimed to be ‚Äúnearly a quarter-mile‚Äù in circumference, on the ground floor, where Armstrong's horses were exercised. Horses normally kept outside could be sheltered there in bad weather. There were 26 box stalls on the first floor, around the outside of the track, with dividing walls only four feet high between the stalls so the horses could see one another, as Armstrong believed that \\"this promotion of neighborly companionship greatly [relieved] the monotony of indoor horse life.\\" Each stall included a doorway to the outside and a window. The doorways led to 26 paddocks, one for each horse, covering . A circular structure in the center contained the tack room, two hospital stalls, and a spiral stairway. There was also an ‚Äúelevator‚Äù for moving hay and grain, and a well shaft was sunk in the center of the barn, which, with the aid of a windmill on a tower at the top of the barn, drew water that was stored in an tank on the third floor. The first floors also included office space and sleeping quarters for staff. The second floor was claimed to hold up to 50 tons of hay and 12,000 bushels of grain. The floor sloped and chutes were cut into the floor so that feed could be easily deposited into the mangers of the horse stalls below. Water from the third floor tank went through a gravity-based plumbing system to each horse's stall. Charles Armstrong, Noah's son, said the barn \\"may truly be called a model of architectural beauty and convenience. This structure is so novel in its conception, so convenient in its economy, and withal so admirably adapted to the purposes of its creation, that a description of it cannot but be of interest to the readers of this sketch.\\" Operation and ownership Interior of round barn, showing main door. Structure is now repurposed as an event center, horse stalls were removed long ago Armstrong believed that Montana's high altitude and the nutrient-rich farmland along the Jefferson River made the location ideal for raising superior racehorses. He owned horses that raced at major US tracks, including a horse, Lord Raglan, who finished third in the 1883 Kentucky Derby. In 1885 or 1886, bought the mare Interpose, in foal, and shipped her to Montana. Her foal, Armstrong's chestnut race horse, Spokane, was foaled in the barn in 1886, and the horse's early training was on the barn's indoor track. After being shipped east at age 2 for race training, Spokane won the Kentucky Derby in 1889, defeating the favorite, then went on to win other major eastern races. Although popular legend states he returned to Montana, there is not evidence that he did so. He was advertised as standing at stud in Kentucky. Landforms surrounding the barn and upper Jefferson River valley The Panic of 1893 caused financial hardship for the Doncaster operation. Armstrong sold the ranch to Max Lauterbach and left Montana in 1900. From there, the barn was owned by a number of different people, and fell into disrepair until purchased by the Bayers family, who owned the Doncaster Farm property from 1933 until 1997. Arthur and Elizabeth Bayers raised Hereford cattle and were major breeders who sold their stock all over North America and held a cattle sale every year in the barn. Their son, Byron Bayers, estimated that their cattle sales over the years topped $5 million. The barn's upkeep was very expensive, particularly the cost of red paint. The Bayers sold the parcel of land where the barn sat in 1985, and it again fall into disrepair. In 1997, it was purchased by real estate developer and local rancher named Allan Hamilton, who began to renovate the building. He had a new roof put on the building and re-leveled the foundation. In 2010, the property was purchased by Tony and Amie James. They formed Swift River investments, a Massachusetts-based business, and began to renovate the structure into a community center. Though \\"everyone\\" thought it had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, no one had done so. In January 2015, the Montana Historic Preservation Board met and unanimously agreed to nominate it. The structure was placed on the NRHP on April 14, 2015. The building was a Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame Legacy Award Inductee in 2008. The Jameses had been willing to donate the building to house the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame itself, but a location in Big Timber, Montana was ultimately selected.

The railroad ran from Goffs, California, to Ivanpah. It was first a private line operated by a mining company, that was acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. History A mining magnate from Denver, Isaac G. Blake, in April 1892, with an interest in the silver mines in Sagamore Canyon in the New York Mountains, built the Needles Reduction Company mill, in the town of Needles and then in December 1892 began building the Nevada Southern Railway, toward those silver mines and the gold mining town of Vanderbilt from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) station at Goffs, completing to a rail camp with a post office, named Manvel, then later built it on up nearer the mines and a pass through the mountains, to a rail camp named Summit which was renamed Manvel when the post office relocated there, in July 1893. Manvel renamed Barnwell was the nearest railhead for nearby mining camps, including Vanderbilt, Goodsprings and the mines at Searchlight, Nevada. In early 1902, the Nevada Southern Railway completed a extension over the New York Mountains, past Vanderbilt, into the Ivanpah Valley, to a railhead named Ivanpah, to serve as the shipping point for the Copper World Mine. Several months later, the ATSF bought the Nevada Southern Railway and renamed it the California Eastern Railway. Abandonment of the line In November 1918, the Copper World Mine was shut down for the last time and in 1921 the California Eastern Railway tore up its tracks between Ivanpah and Goffs. Consolidated into California, Arizona and Santa Fe Railway On December 28, 1911, the California Eastern Railway was consolidated into ATSF's non-operating subsidiary, the California, Arizona and Santa Fe Railway.

It contains a Henry Moore statue of Madonna and the Child originally held at St Peter, Claydon. It is in the deanery of Bosmere, part of the archdeaconry of Ipswich, and the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich.  History  A church is recorded as being within the village of Barham in the Domesday Book. Architectural features in the tower of long-and-short work (or quoins), which is typical of Anglo-Saxon architecture, suggests the church dates from Saxon times. It was known as St Mary from at least 1538, when the parishioners included the inhabitants of Barham Green. In 1975, the parish extended to include the village of Claydon, and when St Peter's Church in Claydon was officially made redundant, St Mary was retitled as St Mary and St Peter.  Monuments  The best known monument in the church is that of the Henry Moore statue of Madonna and Child originally held at St Peter's Church, Claydon. Crafted as a war memorial in commemoration for those in the village who died in the Second World War it was moved to St Mary after the closure of St Peter. Other monuments and brasswork have been part of the church but were removed or destroyed over the course of its history. In the Chancel of the Church were monuments to Jon Southwell, grandfather to Thomas Bedingfield as well as a tomb used for the burial of an unnamed inhabitant of the local estate of Shrubland Hall.  Current status  St Mary and St Peter's Church was listed at Grade I on 9 December 1955. Communion services, using the Book of Common Worship are offered on every Sunday morning at 8am except on the fifth Sunday of a month. On the first Sunday of each month a shorter communion service based on the Book of Common Worship is held at 10am, on the second and fourth Sundays a full communion service is held at 10am. On the third Sunday of each month at 10am a community worship service is held. This service is aimed at a wider age range of the congregation including families with children, adults and those with little or no experience of the Church. The services are often run by community groups or local charitable organisations otherwise unaffiliated with the Church itself.

In addition to premiering oboe works by prominent French composers of the 19th century, including √âmile Paladilhe, Charles-√âdouard Lefebvre, Cl√©mence de Grandval, and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, among others, Gillet was the teacher of Fernand Gillet and Marcel Tabuteau at the Paris Conservatory, helped develop the F. Lor√©e brand of oboe, and composed a number of √©tudes that are still used today.  Biography  Born into a musical family in Louviers on 17 May 1854, Gillet and his brother, cellist and composer, Ernest Gillet (1856‚Äì1940) were musical prodigies. Gillet began studying the oboe when he was twelve and, less than a year later, entered the Paris Conservatory to study with Charles Colin.Storch, Laila. \\"Georges Gillet‚ÄîMaster Teacher and Performer.\\" Journal of the International Double Reed Society 5 (June 1977): 1‚Äì19. After receiving the premier prix at 15 years old, he graduated in 1869. After graduating, he held oboe positions with the Com√©die-Italienne, Concerts Colonne, Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, Op√©ra-Comique, and the Paris Opera, as well as a longtime teaching position at the Paris Conservatory from 1881 to 1919. In addition to orchestra and teaching positions, Gillet was a founding member of the Soci√©t√© de Musique de Chambre pour Instruments √† Vent (Chamber Music Society for Wind Instruments) with Paul Taffanel, Charles-Paul Turban, and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns which premiered works by Charles Gounod, Lefebvre, Saint-Sa√´ns, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Gillet was well respected in 19th Century France, with his nephew Fernand later stating that his sound, technique and reed making were \\"the envy of all\\". Gillet died February 8, 1920 at the age of 65, and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.  Paris Conservatory  Gillet started at the conservatory in October of 1881. As a teacher, two of Gillet's notable students were his nephew, Fernand Gillet and Marcel Tabuteau. Tabuteau used his teacher's methods to adapt a new playing style in America. Other students included two principal oboists of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Albert Weiss and Georges Longy; Alfred Barthel, principal of the Chicago Symphony; Louis Speyer and Alexandre Duvoir. Gillet is credited with introducing vibrato at the Paris Conservatory as well as teaching students to warm up by playing three chromatic scales in thirds in any given practice session. While at the conservatory, Gillet composed a set of etudes, Etudes pur L'enseignement Superieur du Hautbois. Gillet cared greatly about his students, so his life became increasingly strained when three of them were killed in World War I. Gillet retired due to health reasons in 1919.  Work with Lor√©e  Before Lor√©e was established in 1881, the dominant oboe manufacturer was Triebert, headed by Fr√©deric Triebert. Gillet worked with Triebert to formulate the system 6 oboe, better known as the \\"Conservatory\\" oboe. The Lor√©e company was established when Fran√ßois Lor√©e left his job as the last foreman of Triebert. According to Laila Storch, Gillet encouraged Lor√©e to open his own company.Storch, Laila. \\"100 Years F. Lor√©e: 1881‚Äì1981.\\" Journal of the International Double Reed Society 9 (June 1981): 28‚Äì42. Fran√ßois Lor√©e and his son Adolphe Lucien Lor√©e worked with Gillet and made F. Lor√©e oboes one of the most popular brands manufactured. Gillet quickly designated Lor√©e oboes as the required brand to be used by students attending the Paris Conservatory. In 1906, Lor√©e's son, Lucien, collaborated with Gillet to create the \\"conservatory plateau system\\" oboe, a style that is universally in use today.  Compositions  Gillet also composed a set of √©tudes titled √âtudes pour L'enseignement Sup√©rieur du Hautbois, or Studies for the Advanced Teaching of the Oboe, which have become a standard part of oboe repertoire. In the introduction to the √©tudes, Gillet stated that he wrote the studies for his students in order to be able to play the increasingly difficult solo and orchestral repertoire for the oboe, and that composers should use the √©tudes as a rough guide to the technical possibilities of the oboe. The √©tudes are in common use today. Oboist John de Lancie used the √©tude book as the fourth and final book in his pedagogical progression for his students at the Curtis Institute of Music.

Plot Near Moab, Utah, mining engineer Larry Kendall (Richard Basehart), is searching for large uranium deposits and joins forces with Katherine Rand (Phyllis Kirk) and her father, Dr. Andrew Rand (Russell Collins). When Dr. Rand is hurt in an accident, Kendall and Katherine continue on, enlisting the help of an Indian guide, Charlie Rivers (Alan Wells). Larry realizes Larson (Stephen Elliott), a rival mining engineer has sent Pete Barnwell (Charles Wagenheim) to trail them. After finding uranium ore in a series of caverns, they send Charlie back with ore samples to take to the Atomic Energy Commission office in Moab, while Larry and Kathy stay behind to protect their claim. While they had been at odds earlier, the pair now realize they are falling in love. Barnwell finds their location and attacks them, shooting Kathy, and setting off an explosion that seals the entrance to the cavern. Knowing that Charlie has ore samples, Barnwell kills him in an ambush and steals the samples. In the morning, when Kathy sees bats returning, they both realize that there is a small opening that at least Larry can climb through. Finding a horse that they had tied up, Larry heads off to town, but Barnwell is already at the Atomic Energy Commission office, plotting to turn the samples in for himself, when Larson shows up. The two thieves employ a helicopter to get back to the mine where Kathy is still trapped. While Barnwell is left to guard the cavern entrance, Larson takes to his helicopter to chase down Larry. When Charlie's brothers find his body, Joe (Richard Hale) and Mickey Rivers (Tommy Cook), follow his tracks to the cavern where Joe forces a confession from Barnwell and kills him. The two Rivers brothers set out for Moab and find Larry on the way who tells them that Kathy is wounded and trapped. The group gets back to the cavern just as Larson returns.

By the time the Spanish arrived, there were a number of indigenous forms, a number of which are still made today. These and products that the Spanish introduced form the combined tradition that remains today. Like other Mexican handcrafts, sales to tourists and collectors is important, but basketry is not as popular as other handcrafts. Basketry techniques and materials vary from region to region depending on the vegetation available (with about eighty species of plant use nationwide), with important traditions in Sonora, State of Mexico, Michoac√°n, Veracruz, Oaxaca and the Yucat√°n Peninsula. History=Pre Hispanic period Scene from the Florentine Codex show food in baskets Basketry was one of Mesoamerica‚Äôs oldest crafts, important since the early hunting- gathering period and predates both the manipulation of fire and the creation of pottery. The craft was originally developed from simple containers for gathering foodstuffs in nature and storage, to other items such as mats, boxes, chairs, cradles, sandals and some clothing items. Basketry in Mexico has two lineages, one indigenous and one Spanish, distinguished mostly by the products made. Many products that date back from the pre Hispanic period still survive such as mats called petates, carrying braces and baskets for the transport of wares to market. The last two were particularly important in the period because there were no beasts of burden, and merchandise was carried by men over land. Some pre Hispanic pieces were very finely woven with intricate designs, comparable to European tapestries. Much of the history of basketmaking has been lost since baskets are biodegradable. There are only fragments of basketry from archeological records because of the degradation of the biological materials used to make them. The best finds have been in dry caves and rock croppings, as well as basket impressions in ceramics. Most of the finds have been in arid and semi-arid areas in the northwest of Mexico, with some found at the Ocampo and Romero caves in Tamaulipas, containing evidence of both coil and braided wares. Other significant finds include those at Coxcatl√°n Cave in Tehuac√°n, Puebla, Guila Naquitz, Oaxaca, the Gallo Caves and Chaguera Cave in Morelos, as well as in Michoac√°n and the Valley of Mexico. These include evidence of rope and bag making. Colonial period As no complete pieces survive, the best evidence of pre-Hispanic and colonial period basketry forms is from contemporary codices such as the Mendocino Codex, written chronicles and pieces that appear in paintings. They confirm the existence of indigenous products such as , seats (), seats with back (), , , , boxes (petlanali), sandals, nets, fans, (carrying braces) and more. They also indicate that a number of products and techniques have since disappeared. For example, in the Valley of Mexico, lakeside communities such as Xochimilco and Xoltocan were dedicated to making items such as from the rushes growing at the water‚Äôs edge. However, this has died out with the draining of the lakes. Indigenous artisans continued to make basketry through the entire colonial period. Unlike other handcrafts, it was considered completely domestic and therefore not regulated like ceramics and woodworking, nor was there any formal teaching by Spanish missionaries. However, European designs, such as baskets with handles, sombreros, palms braided for Palm Sunday and heart decorations were introduced, along with the working of wheat and rye straw. 19th century Drawing of a man carrying baskets, dated 1888 Likewise, no pieces from the 19th century survive, but at that time, the painting of everyday scenes became more popular, including images of homes, which show the survival of indigenous items like petates, along with sombreros and European style baskets. European travelers in Mexico documented what they saw, including the lives of common people, with baskets getting mentioned. One item noted in the records of this time but not before is that of the capote, a kind of rain cape created with layers of palm fronds. 20th century to the present Weaving reeds together Basket display at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City The early 20th century saw a revived interest in Mexico‚Äôs handcraft traditions, including basketry. During the early 20th century the making of hats from palm and other fibers was taught to prisoners in municipal jails, something that survives to the present. Writer Manuel Toussaint noted the quantity and quality of baskets he found in Oaxaca during his travels, along with those in Puebla and the State of Mexico. For the 100th anniversary of the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence, artists such as Dr. Atl, Roberto Montenegro and others organized an exhibition of the country‚Äôs handcrafts and folk art. The exhibition resulted in a large catalog, of which Chapter 16 was dedicated to basketry. It provides a snapshot of the state of the craft at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th. In this catalog, Dr Atl affirms that the most important basketry item remained the petate, noted the use of as basic utilitarian items, with documentation of the large basketry production in the states of Puebla, State of Mexico, Guanajuato, Michoac√°n and Jalisco. The creation of miniature figures from Silao, Irapuato, Guanajuato and Santa Mar√≠a del R√≠o, SLP are also mentioned. However mention of the work done in the north of the country is absent. Despite the interest in documenting handcraft traditions, no complete pieces from before the 1960s remain. Although not as popular as other handcraft traditions, basketry can be found all over Mexico, especially in indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Chiapas and Veracruz, with many created for collectors. However, a number of basketry items are still make for local use, such as a cradle used by indigenous women in the Sierra Norte of Puebla, and pieces created for ceremonies in various parts of Mexico, such as special baskets created by the Seri in Sonora and the Nahuas in the Huasteca region for Day of the Dead. Most artisans make the items part-time, as a compliment to other economic activities, and workshops are based in family homes, with various members participating. Some artisans have organized into cooperatives to promote their work. However, most basketry products are easily replaced by manufactured goods, and in areas the resources needed to make them are becoming scarce. Basketry has declined in Mexico with the introduction of plastic containers in the 1970s and similar products imported from Asian since 2005. For these and other reasons, basketry is not as important a handcraft as others such as ceramics, but it still plays an important domestic and commercial roles in rural communities in states such as Guerrero, State of Mexico, Oaxaca, Puebla, Sonora, Michoac√°n and Veracruz. Baskets for bread vendors at the La Merced Market A microcosm of the basketry market is in the La Merced Market in Mexico City, which sells products from Puebla, Tlaxcala, Quer√©taro, Michoac√°n, State of Mexico, Guerrero and San Luis Potos√≠. There are about 30 stalls selling basketry products in La Merced, many of which have been passed down through the generations. Most of the sales are to other merchants, such as those who sell tacos de canasta, traditional sweets and bakeries. Many of the sales occur in conjunction with certain celebrations. Holy Week sees the sales of baskets and palms. For Day of the Dead, petates, chiquihuites and small baskets are bought as altar decorations. For Christmas, baskets are used to hold food and traditional decorations. Many of these sales are to people from the edges of Mexico City where traditions survive better. However, many of these stalls must now offer cheaper Asian made goods along with other items in order to stay in business. Where tourism has a favorable impact on conserving basketry traditions, it tends to have a negative effect on the resources used to make the products because of demand. Materials Reed basketry products at the Palm Sunday Handcraft Market in Uruapan, Michoac√°n Basketry is related to other textiles arts, except that the plant fibers used are stiffer, ranging from rigid, hard works made from branches or strips of wood to the nearly cloth-like pieces from leaf fibers such as ixtle (maguey fiber) and hennequin. Apart from ixtle and hennequin, the vegetation used can be divided into two types: hard or semi rigid, which include materials such as wood strips and willow branches or canes to softer materials such as palm fronds, reeds, straw and other plant stems. The latter materials create items of more flexibility than the first. The materials used in a give location vary, depending on the local vegetation, and since it mostly depends on plant fibers, it is mostly a rural occupation, being close to sources. Materials may be mixed in the making of a piece, generally to provide patterns and textures, sometimes color. Since most materials are taken from the wild, basketry affects the surrounding ecosystems to varying degrees. In Mexico about eighty species of plants are used in basketry from twenty botanical families. These include agaves (Agavefourcroydes, A. sisalana, A. letonae, A. zapupe, A. funkiana), rushes and reeds (Arundo donax, Phragmites communis), palms (Acanthorriza mocinni, Brahea dulcis, Sabal mexicana, S. causarium, Acrocomia crispa), yucca (Yucca glauca, Y. elata, Y. treculeana, Y. mohavensis, Y. baccata), and various others (Smilacaceae, Bignoniaceae, Araceae, Dilleniaceae, Sapindaceae). It also includes the use of some trees such as willow (Salicaceae), pines (Pinaceae) and aquatic plants such as the lily (Eichhornia crassipes) and thalia (Thalia sp.). Cultivated plant fibers include wheat and rye straw, along with hennequin. In the past decades new materials have made their way into Mexican basketry including synthetic fiber strips, chains, metal rings, cloth strips and leather. Baskets made with synthetic fibers at San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur Hennequin and ixtle work does not use the entire plant, but rather fibers are extracted from the plant. Hennequin is grown in the Yucat√°n Peninsula and ixtle may be grown or gathered from wild plants in semi arid areas in various parts of Mexico. Both have been used to create string carrying bags, and nets, which hennequin having great value in the past in the making of rope. In the latter 20th century, the development of synthetic fibers, particularly polypropolene and polyethylene as provided artisans with often cheaper and more colorful alternatives, important in areas where natural plant fibers have become scarce. However, they have not replaced the use of natural materials. One community particularly noted for their work in these strips is Zapotitl√°n Palmas in Oaxaca. Basketry products Finely woven hats from \\"jipi\\" palm made in Calkini, Campeche Reed petates Basketry products on the street in Michoac√°n Basketry items are generally of three types, flat items, two- or three dimensional forms for carrying or those used for storage. Most of these are utilitarian, used then thrown away when worn out. Basketry in Mexico has two lineages. Indigenous products include , , , and , many of which survive to the present day. Petates are large flat mats made from reeds or palm fronds. Those made with the latter have wider weaves. They have been used to wrap bundles, to sleep on, bury the dead and event to celebrate marriages. They are still relatively common, especially in indigenous communities. Tompeates or were made to store and transport fruit, vegetables and other merchandise for market. In the pre-Hispanic and early colonial period, they were tied on a person‚Äôs back with a mecapal (brace) to transport as there were no beasts of burden in the pre Hispanic period. Today the term is still used in some areas to refer to a container used to keep tortillas warm. Sometimes the term tlaxcal is used instead. Petacas were large containers used to store clothing, and in the pre Hispanic and colonial period may have been the only furniture like piece in houses of the poor. Cacles, and were clothing items. Items introduced by the Spanish include handled baskets, sombreros makes with braided fibers, , braided palm fronds for Palm Sunday, and heart decorations makes with straw (). Today, many of these items may be found. The most common items include handled baskets, tortilla holders, chairs, toys (generally miniatures of animals and objects, along with dolls), flowers, spheres and bags. Another common item is the soplador, a kind of fan used to fan charcoal fires. Palm fronds are woven into intricate designs for Palm Sunday. In Veracruz, basketry techniques are used to create traps for fish flowing in rivers. Ixtle and hennequin are still used, most commonly for the creation of bags and nets, and in the case of ixtle, as a kind of embroidery thread for leather. Basketry techniques Coil basket in progress Women making baskets with the weaving technique in Cuitzeo, Michoac√°n There are several main techniques associated with the making of basketry in Mexico, coils, braiding. weaving and twisting. The techniques used vary widely over the country as it depends on the available raw materials. Three dimensional object have three parts, a center, from which the process begins, walls (sides) and edges. The oldest technique is the coil, where fibers are pressed together, coiled onto themselves and held in place by sewing them. Vestiges of this types have been found and dated archeologically, with the best-known example today being the corita baskets of the Seri people. One other technique is the twisting of fibers on themselves. This is combined with weaving in mixed technique pieces. Woven pieces start with two or more cross pieces and the thinner pieces woven over them. It is generally used to create containers, carrying pieces and mats and is the most versatile. The braiding technique is most commonly used for the making of hats. Baskets are decorated in several ways: painting, changes in technique as the piece takes shape and the use of materials of different colors and textures. When painting is chosen, it is applied to a finished piece. Sometimes other elements are added to finished pieces, such as stitching, shells and feathers. As working with ixtle and hennequin require different techniques, such as separating the fibers from the rest of the plant, this work is subclassified in Mexico under the name of jarcier√≠a. Regional traditions The main basketry styles are North, Center, Mixtec/Oaxaca, Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast, principally divided by the types of plant matter used as raw material. Central Mexico Basket in progress in Tenancingo, State of Mexico The basketry of the Center of the country covers the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato, Aguascalientes, San Luis Potos√≠, Quer√©taro, Hidalgo, State of Mexico and Morelos. The basketry tradition here is mixed, mostly of European techniques and designs but indigenous forms are still produced. The most common materials include rushes and reeds, especially in the State of Mexico, Morelos and Hidalgo, around the shores of the Lerma and Tultepec rivers, Lake Cuitzeo, Lake Patzcuaro and Lake Chapala. The working of willow branches to make baskets is also common. Palm fronds are worked in warmer climates from Matehuala, San Luis Potosi, south to the state of Morelos, mostly to make , {{langesfanes} and . In the Tierra Caliente of Michoac√°n, palm fronds are produced in abundance and are used to create sombreros, , fans, brooms and (rain capes). In the State of Mexico, most basketry artisans are indigenous people, most of whom live in Jiquipilco, Temascalcingo, Tenancingo and Toluca (San Andr√©s Cuexcontitl√°n and San Cristobal Huichochitlan neighborhoods). A wide variety of products are made from handled baskedts, tortilla keepers, bags, placemats and more, with many having several colors, generally from dying the fibers in different colors. Artisans in the municipality of Tenancingo use ten species of plants. In Amanalco, Donato Guerra and El Oro, baskets are made that include ornaments of high fire ceramics, nickel-plated brass and glass. In Santa Ana Tepaltitl√°n palm fronds are dyed in bright colors and the spiral method is used. The town used to produce an abundance of very fine handled baskets and other wares with animal and human decorative motifs. However, only a few such artisans remain. Younger artisans make cruder pieces and often make simpler geometric motifs. In Michoac√°n, basketry items are likewise varied, from baskets and other containers of varying sizes, miniatures, toys and decorative items. The working of wheat straw is also common, most traditionally to make heart-shaped figures for kitchens along with other decorative figures such as a suns, moons, nativity and other Biblical scenes. In Zac√°n, there are still some older artisans who make sombreros using ixtle, which are waterproof and traditionally used for fieldwork. In Uripit√≠o a plant called cucharilla is used to make petates and fans. Sombrero for charros are also made along in neighboring Jalisco state as well as San Francisco del Rinc√≥n, Manuel Doblado and Tierra Blanca, Guanajuato. The main basket producers in Guanajuato are the towns of Ichupio and Quer√©ndaro, whose main clients are the strawberry farms in and around Irapuato. In Silao, miniatures and toys are made with basketry techniques. In the Sierra Norte of Puebla, Otomis and Nahuas create cradles and carrying bags using bark, a tradition date back far into the pre Hispanic period. The community of Santa Cruz, Puebla still creates fine petates with geometric designs. Those of Santa Mar√≠a Chigmecatitlan create miniatures of figures such as musicians and circus performers along with complete nativity scenes. In Guerrero state decorative baskets are made with geometric and animal motifs with palm fronds dyed in various colors. Mixtec/Oaxaca Artisan Amador Mart√≠nez Antonio, preparing materials in Santa Cruz Papalutla, Oaxaca Basketry made with reeds and rushes is done in various regions in the state of Oaxaca, such as the Central Valleys, the Miahuatl√°n Valley, the Mixtec region and Tehuantepec, mostly baskets for the transport of merchandise. Most of these wares originally were for carrying merchandise to market, along with and . From the mid 1980s, Oaxacan basketry, especially in the Central Valleys as incorporated Asian elements into their designs. Amador Martinez went to China to learn bamboo basketry. When he returned, he taught other artisans what he had learned. The new forms have also been incorporated in the basketry workshops of the prisons in Tlacolula and Ocotl√°n. The new forms and decorations have had steady levels of increasing acceptance in the region. The best known basketry of the state is done by the Mixtecs, whose territory extends over parts of Oaxaca, Puebla and Guerrero. Traditionally their work was almost exclusively done with palm fronds and noted in the Sierra Codex. However, environmental degradation has made this raw material scarce, putting the craft in danger. Those who still work with it create , , fans, and sombreros, and for a number of households, it is their only source of income. The old fretwork decorative designs have almost disappeared, but people can still be seen working the fronds in various public spaces. Despite this, the finest are made in this region, along with the town of San Luis Amatl√°n. There are programs to support basket makers in the Mixtec area of Oaxaca, such as FIDEPAL (Fideicomiso de la Palma), a society dedicated to conserving and promoting the craft. One other noted town in the Oaxaca Mixtec region is Zapotitlan Palmas, near Huajuapan de Le√≥n. Before the 1980s they made their wares exclusively with a species of palm (Sabal mexicana Mart), but since then they have switched to polyethylene fiber for merchandise to be sold outside of the town mostly in Huajuapan, with palm frond work reserved for personal use. North A corita basket on display at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City The basketry of the North covers work done in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Durango and Zacatecas. The Seri people in Sonora have one of the best-known basketry traditions, with the most important items being a kind of basket called the corita. Until the popularity of ironwood carvings, baskets were the main notable craft of the Seri. Coritas are mad with the branches of a brush or bush called torote (jatropha cuneatas), which grows in the desert. Except for shoulder yokes used to carry bundles on the back, baskets were used to transport everything except liquids by the Seri. Shallow baskets were carried on the head by Seri women, balanced by the use of a head ring and carried everything from wood, harvests, meat and clothes. Baskets were used for winnowing and storage. The served as suitcases, buckets and refuse containers. Seri baskets are heavy made of bundles of split torote wrapped with the more flexible inner bark of torote stems. The torote is split using the teeth. The coil method is used, with the construction so tight in a number of works that they can hold water. Traditionally it has been women‚Äôs work, but the demand for authentic caritas has brought men into their making as well. Traditional pieces such as containers and cradles are still made along with newer works for the tourist trade, such as shallow bowls with a wide variety of decorative motifs from the Seri religion and culture. Some stories suggest that these baskets have magical properties or contain something of the spirit of the women who made them. A commonly used decorative color is a rust-red, made from the root bark of the krameria family, most often kromeris gray, commonly called white ratany. Recently commercial dye has been used. While the Seri probably decorated their baskets well into the past, the wide array of designs is more modern, probably because of the sale of the items to foreigners. The craft has declined because of the introduction of modern plastic, metal, etc. containers, but continues because of tourism to Seri areas, but not as much as the carving as the process is more labor- intensive. Other northern basket traditions include that of the Pimas in Sonora, who weave petates and palm frond hats, along with spiral baskets. In Baja California, the Cochimies and Pai-pai weave palm fronds, cedar leaves and willow branches, using the spiral method to make baskets. The Tarahumara in Chihuahua work with palm fronds, reeds and pine needles. Many of there baskets are of a small size, similar to the pre-Hispanic . Those of pine needles keep their distinctive odor for some time. Baskets for carrying water, called , have doubled walls. The Huichols in Durango, Nayarit and Jalisco make hats and small box containers with palm fronds. The boxes are similar to , but with a rectangular prism like shape. Traditionally these have been used to store arrows. Gulf of Mexico/Southeast The Gulf of Mexico and Southeast extend the length of the state of Veracruz and into the Yucat√°n Peninsula and Chiapas. Basketry is made all over the state of Veracruz, with each ethnic and regional group producing its own style, based on their needs and other factors. Over time a number of traditional utilitarian and ceremonial items has been converted into decorative ones, and still support a number of Veracruz families. The Totonac principally use reeds, (A. donax) among others.) In the south of Veracruz, the Nahua communities of Pajap√°n and Hueyapan de Ocampo produce elaborate baskets with wicker and the roots of the Philodendrum radiatum and Monstera deliciosa. In the center of the state, mestizo groups create various products such as the palm petates in Tigrillos and shrimp traps in Jalcomulco located in the center of Veracruz on the eastern side of the Cofre de Perote. It is surrounded by semi deciduous rainforest with over 800 species of plants, as well a fruit orchards and fields with sugar cane and other crops. Its basketry is mostly linked to the harvesting of crayfish and fresh water shrimp form the Los Pescados River, using basket-like traps traditionally made from reeds. Since the 1990s, the economy has changed from agriculture and fishing towards eco-tourism. This had led to many trap makers to expand their skills into other objects such decorative baskets, vases, fruit bowls, lamp bases and more. The demand for these products has taken a toll on the plants used for this purpose. In Chiapas, palm fronds are often used, along with ixtle, which is most commonly used by the Lacandons to makes bags and nets. In Tabasco palm fronds are used to make petates and various types of fans. In Campeche and part of the state of Yucat√°n they make very fine hats from a specific species of palm, locally called jipi-japa. This work is often done in caves to keep the fibers moist and flexible while they are worked. Communities best known for this work include Ticul, Yucat√°n and Becal, Campeche. Palm frond baskets are made all over the Yucat√°n peninsula, often dyed, using the coil method. Most of these baskets are made by women, with the best known community for this activity being Halach√≥.

It was first isolated in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. It counts with a setose carapace, an acute rostrum, shallow adrostral furrows and a basicerite with a strong ventrolateral tooth. The lamella of its scaphocerite is not reduced, with an anterior margin that is concave. Its third maxilliped counts with an epipodial plate bearing thick setae, while its first chelipeds are found with their merus bearing a strong disto-mesial tooth; its third pereiopod has an armed ischium, with a simple and conical dactylus. Its telson is broad, distally tapering, with 2 pairs of dorsal spines. The species is named after its characteristic colour pattern, including white, red and orange.Anker, Arthur. \\"Two new species of snapping shrimps from the Indo-Pacific, with remarks on colour patterns and sibling species in Alpheidae (Crustacea: Caridea).\\" Raffles Bulletin of Zoology 49.1 (2001): 57-72. Description Alpheus tricolor has a carapace length of about , a total length of and chela length of . Its carapace is smooth, possessing shallow grooves latero- anteriorly, and erect setae dorsally. Its pterygostomial angle is rounded, while its rostrum is well developed and acute; its orbital hoods are inflated, lacking teeth. Its eyes have small anterior processes, and its antennular peduncles are stout. Its antenna shows a basicerite bearing an acute, ventrolateral tooth. Its mouthparts are typical for Alpheus: its mandible with a 2-jointed palp, its incisor process bearing about 12 teeth, and showing a stout molar process; its maxillula has a bilobed palp, while its maxilla shows no characteristics of note. The surface of each somite on its abdomen bears conspicuous setae that are proximal to its dorsoposterior margin. Its uropodal exopod has a strong lateral spine, and a sinuous diaresis. The species' telson is broad, distally tapering, exhibiting 2 pairs of dorsal spines in deep depressions; it counts with numerous long setae between lateral spines. Its anal tubercles are well developed. Coloration Its carapace is coloured mostly yellow-orange, with three white patches laterally. Its rostrum is reddish-orange and its orbital hoods translucent. The antennal and antennular peduncles are orange-red, while its mouthparts are mostly found to be colourless, except for the palp and caridean lobe of its first maxilliped, which are reddish. Its major and minor chelipeds are orange-red; the merus showing a distal white patch; chelae almost white on the tips of fingers. In younger individuals, fingers and distal portions of palms are white. The species' abdominal segments are dorsally yellow-orange, lateroventrally deep red. The tail fan is a deep red colour, with a broad white band across its near half. Behaviour The shrimp is thought to spend most of the time in burrows and not interacting with other species, as observed with specimens in aquariums. This is different behaviour as that observed in Alpheus bellulus. See also *Decapod anatomy ReferencesFurther reading *Williams, S. T., N. Knowlton, and L. A.

Life  Richard Mudge was the son of the teacher and cleric Zachariah Mudge (1694‚Äì1769), and his wife Mary Fox (died c.1762). The third of five children, he was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford from 1735, graduating BA in 1738 and MA in 1741. Initially the private chaplain to Heneage Finch, Lord Guernsey (later 3rd Earl of Aylesford), Mudge became curate of the villages of Great and Little Packington in 1741. Between 1745 and 1757 he was Rector at Little Packington, and from 1750 he was also Curate of St. Bartholomew's Chapel in Birmingham. He married Mary Hopkins on 27 March 1747 at St Cross Church, Oxford, with whom he had one daughter, Mary (bap. 1752). After 1756 Lord Guernsey established Mudge in the independent living of Bedworth, where he lived until his death.  Work  In 1749 he published a set of six, string concertos (6 Concertos in Seven Parts). The last five of these are written for two solo violins and string orchestra, and No.1 also has a trumpet part. They are all in the form of a French Overture, with a concluding Minuet, and follow the conventional slow- fast-slow-fast pattern of movements common to the form. All these works show the influence of Handel and Francesco Geminiani, and they were staples of the provincial music society repertoire.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66380 The collection also contains an eight-part \\"Non Nobis Domine\\".http://www.musicweb- international.com/classrev/2009/June09/Mudge_tudor7173.htm The first recording of Mudge's concerto set was made in 1957 with Maurice Andr√© performing the trumpet concerto. A modern edition of Concertos 1, 4 and 6 had already been edited by Gerald Finzi, but a facsimile edition of the complete set was published in 1993 by King's Music. As late as the 1990s, two portfolios were rediscovered containing other manuscripts of Richard Mudge's music.
