After providing good service to the Cobbold's, she left their employ. However, in 1797 she stole a horse from them to ride to London to find her lover. She was arrested and after being found guilty in a trial she was sentenced to death, subsequently commuted to transportation to Australia. Her story was subsequently turned into a novel by Elizabeth's son, Richard Cobbold, in 1845 and has remained popular ever since.

His senior commands include as head of the General Training and Management Directorate. Gunnarsson is known for leading the special working group assigned with investigation which units would be disbanded in accordance with the Defence Act of 2004. Gunnarsson served in the Swedish Armed Forces for over 30 years before retiring in 2005. He then served as Director General of the Rescue Services Agency, as CEO of Storstockholms Lokaltrafik and as managing director of the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade. Career Gunnarsson was born in Bor√•s, Sweden. Gunnarsson became a lieutenant in 1974 and he attended the Marine Corps Command and Staff College at the Marine Corps Base Quantico from 1991 to 1992. After his time at Quantico, Gunnarsson was posted to the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters, Plans and Policy Directorate, as a section head. In 1994, he took command of one of the marine defense battalions in the Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 1). Gunnarsson was commanding officer of the Marinens krigsh√∂gskola (MKHS) from 1995 to 1996 and was promoted to colonel in 1996. He was then sent to Croatia as Chief Military Observer of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) based out of Cavtat. Gunnarsson served as the first mission commander from January to November 1996. In 1997, he was promoted colonel 1st class, and posted as Chief of the Naval Staff. In 1999, he was promoted to major general and assumed the position of Assistant Head of Plans and Policy Directorate, Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters. This posting made him the Supreme Commander's main planner for long term planning and responsible for the Swedish Armed Forces' annual reports to the Ministry of Defence and the Riksdag. In 2002, Gunnarsson was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed head of the General Training and Management Directorate (Grundorganisationsledningen). On August 28, 2003, it was decided that a special working group would prepare a basis for the following year's Defence Act on what the Swedish Armed Forces's general organization would look like in the future. The group included, among others, Gunnarsson together with the director Dan Ohlsson, senior adviser Johan Appelberg and the desk officer M√•rten Sundmark from the Ministry of Defence and colonel Carol Paraniak and colonel Bo Bengtsson from the Swedish Armed Forces. This group traveled around Sweden in 2004 to be able to make a decision about which units should be disbanded. As soon as they arrived at a place it said the \\"Death Squad is in town\\" in the local newspapers. Gunnarsson led the group, whose real name was the Arbetsgruppen Grundorganisation, AG Gro. Gunnarsson was scheduled to take up the position of Chief of Training & Development (Produktionschef) at the newly organized headquarters from 1 July 2005. Instead, Gunnarsson chose to retire on the same date. Gunnarsson then worked with company development. In January 2006, the Swedish government appointed Gunnarsson as Director General of the Rescue Services Agency in Karlstad. He took office on 1 March 2006. He was also chairman of the Rescue Services Agency's Board of Directors and the Centrum f√∂r risk- och s√§kerhetsutbildning (\\"Center for Risk and Safety Training\\"). Furthermore, he was a member of the R√•det f√∂r r√§ddningstj√§nst (\\"Rescue Services Council\\") and Folke Bernadotte Academy's program and activities council.

It took place approximately near Kerj Abu Dulaf, the present-day between Hamadan and Arak, and was a decisive Malik-Shah I victory. After death Alp-Arslan, Malik-Shah was declared as the new sultan of the empire. However, right after Malik-Shah accession, his uncle Qavurt claimed the throne for himself and sent Malik-Shah a message which said: \\"I am the eldest brother, and you are a youthful son; I have the greater right to my brother Alp-Arslan's inheritance.\\" Malik-Shah then replied by sending the following message: \\"A brother does not inherit when there is a son.\\". This message enraged Qavurt, who thereafter occupied Isfahan. In 1073 a battle took place near Hamadan, which lasted three days. Qavurt was accompanied by his seven sons, and his army consisted of Turkmens, while the army of Malik-Shah consisted of ghulams (\\"military slaves\\") and contingents of Kurdish and Arab troops. During the battle, the Turks of Malik- Shah's army mutinied against him, but he nevertheless managed to defeat and capture Qavurt. Qavurt then begged for mercy and in return promised to retire to Oman. However, Nizam al-Mulk declined the offer, claiming that sparing him was an indication of weakness. After some time, Qavurt was strangled to death with a bowstring, while two of his sons were blinded. After having dealt with that problem, Malik-Shah appointed Qutlugh-Tegin as the governor of Fars and Sav-Tegin as the governor of Kerman. References  Sources  * Wikipedia contributors.

It was first played in the Circo Metropolitano de Caracas on 26 November 1897. Background A Cinematograph, one of the premier filmmaking cameras, produced in France. Ruiz was a showman by trade, and had got into the business of showing films. A variety show he was putting on at the Circo Metropolitano included film as well as zarzuelas and circus acts; in 1897, after the release of the first Venezuelan films in Maracaibo, Ruiz went into business with Ricardo Rouffet to create their own films. One of the people he employed to show films at the Circo was Gabriel Veyre; Veyre's Cinematograph may have been used to make Ruiz' films. Azuaga Garc√≠a describes Ruiz' choice to hold film showings in a circus as \\"gaudy\\", as the previous screenings were held in spectacular theatres and halls, but also suggests it was Ruiz' attempt to \\"truly bring cinema to the popular classes\\". Film screening and content In November 1897, advertisements in Caracas start promoting \\"the new Projectoscope\\", claiming it played in color, and \\"criollo views\\", referring to the pair of films made by Venezuelans Ruiz and Rouffet. They also claimed that they would be the first Venezuelan-made films to play in the capital. Una paliza... was shown before its pair, Carlos Ruiz peleado..., but less is known of it. The \\"estado Sarr√≠a\\" of the title refers to a location in La Candelaria, Caracas, a neighborhood nicknamed this after a hippodrome in the area that was demolished in 1896, itself named for landowner Julio F. Sarr√≠a. The films may have been advertised to the French as showing \\"real things\\" from life in the Caracas area. Discussing the director of the pair of films, Sueiro Villanueva proposes that it could have been Rouffet or someone else altogether, acting as director but staying absent from the public screenings. She also discusses how in Venezuela at the time, the arts were housed in social spaces exclusive to the upper classes that participated in them, specifically mentioning the estado Sarr√≠a as an area that was derided; Ruiz attempted to change this, by screening in a lower-class space, and by presenting the areas and issues relevant to its occupants' lives in this film. Details on neither Rouffet nor the films were published in the local press, suggesting that it was critically overlooked.

It is a Grade II listed building. History An early Shirehall was built on the site in around 1270 and refurbished during the Elizabethan era. The current Shirehall, which was designed by William Wilkins in the Tudor Revival style, was completed in 1823. It was originally used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Norfolk County Council. After the County Council moved to County Hall in 1968, the building continued to be used as a Crown Court until the new Courts Complex in Bishopgate was completed in 1988. The building became the Regimental Museum of the Royal Norfolk Regiment in 1990. Although archives and the reserve collections are still held in the Shirehall, the principal museum display there closed in September 2011, and relocated to the main Norwich Castle Museum, reopening fully in 2013. The Norwich Castle Study Centre, which now occupies the Shirehall, contains a number of important collections, including an extensive collection of more than 20,000 costume and textile items, built up over a period of some 130 years, and previously kept in other Norwich museums.

Salmon fishing is allowed, subject to limits. Course The Trinit√© River is in Baie-Trinit√©, Manicouagan, Quebec. It is long. The river runs through a winding valley in the Canadian Shield before entering the Gulf of Saint Lawrence beside the village of Baie-Trinit√©. There are a few small lakes in the northern, Sept-Rivieres part of the river basin, including Lac Washamahwun, Lac Lanctot, Lac Rimouski and Lac Fox. The river flows slowly through 67 shallow fishing holes interspersed with large rocks, with a steeper section near the end where it runs faster. The river is accessible from Quebec Route 138. Environment A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the upper portion of the river rising and flowing south through the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. Most of the river flows through the fir/white birch domain of the boreal zone. The average annual temperature in the region is . The warmest month is August, when the average temperature is , and the coldest is February, with . Dam Salmon use the fish ladder at the Grande Trinit√© River dam to reach the upper part of the river. This was an old wooden structure built in 1929. It collapsed in May 2009 and a CDN$4.5 million project was started to build a replacement concrete structure. As part of the process cofferdams were built upstream and downstream. The fish could still pass, but fishing was disrupted. Fishing Most of the river is managed for recreational fishing by the Zec de la Rivi√®re-de-la-Trinit√©, which provides campsites, cabins an boat rentals. Every year 700 to 800 salmon return. The healthy salmon population is an important attraction to visitors. There are also sea trout. The fishing season is from June to mid-September. Management regimes The Saint-Lawrence Paper company held the exclusive fishing rights to the Grande Trinit√© and Petite Trinit√© rivers from the 1930s until the early 1960s, when it sold them to Domtar. The river was used by wealthy Domtar executives and their guests until May 1976, when it was released to the non-profit Baie-Trinit√© Development Corporation in May 1976 in response to pressure from the people of Baie-Trinit√©. In 1978 the Baie-Trinit√© fishing and hunting reserve was created to cover the of territory between the existing Rivi√®re-Trinit√© and Petite-Trinit√© reserves. The Rivi√®re- Trinit√© reserve became the Zone d'exploitation control√©e (Zec) Rivi√®re de la Trinit√©.

It was triggered by the death of the Conservative Party Member of Parliament Victor Milward on 31 May 1901.  Campaign  Despite the Liberals not fielding a candidate in 1900, they did this time with their candidate Bolton King who has been described as a 'radical idealist'. His objective was \\"to carry the principles of Christianity into political and social life\\". However, before his campaign could even get off the ground it ran into trouble. His adoption meeting at the Corn Exchange descended into chaos with speeches being interrupted with patrotic songs, chairs being turned over and ultimately, fighting breaking out. By contrast, the Conservative candidate, Philip Foster, had a much more peaceful adoption meeting the next evening in which he called for tolerance as a result of the previous night's events. Two further Liberal meetings at the Corn exchange received an equally malicious response.

It is part of the Jurassic Park franchise, and follows the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018). It stars Andr√© Holland, Natalie Martinez, Melody Hurd, and Pierson Salvador. On September 15, 2019, it premiered on FX and was subsequently released online. Plot Set one year after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, a blended family from Oakland, California goes on a camping trip at the fictional Big Rock National Park in Northern California, approximately from where dinosaurs from Fallen Kingdom were let loose. The film chronicles the first major confrontation between humans and the dinosaurs. The family is enjoying their camping when they are suddenly greeted by a Nasutoceratops and her baby. To their terror, an adult Allosaurus attacks the Nasutoceratops baby and the mother tries to protect her baby. A battle ensues between the two dinosaurs and the family decide to hide inside their RV. Eventually, a third Nasutoceratops appears from the woods, driving back the Allosaurus. The Nasutoceratops escape and the baby of the family starts crying. Hearing the cry, the Allosaurus starts wrecking the RV apart in order to feed on the family hiding inside. To their relief, the daughter shoots the Allosaurus in its head and eye with a crossbow, which causes the dinosaur to flee. During the credits, found footage clips of dinosaurs and other creatures are shown; a pack of Compsognathus harmlessly chase after a scared little girl, a Stegosaurus causes a car to swerve and drive off a cliff, fishermen in a boat peacefully pass by a Parasaurolophus on the banks of a river, a Mosasaurus eats a great white shark after it eats a seal, and a Pteranodon swoops at a dove that had just been released at a wedding. Cast * Andr√© Holland as Dennis, the father of the family * Natalie Martinez as Mariana, the mother of the family * Melody Hurd as Kadasha, Dennis's daughter and Mariana's stepdaughter * Pierson Salvador as Mateo, Mariana's son and Dennis's stepson * Chris Finlayson as Greg, a friend of the family * Noah and Ethan Cole as the baby son of Dennis and Mariana and the half-brother of Kadasha and Mateo Production =Development= The idea for the film originated when Universal Studios asked Trevorrow if he would be interested in making a potential Jurassic World short film, and he accepted. Trevorrow wrote the short film with Emily Carmichael, who was already working with him to write Jurassic World: Dominion (2021). The short film's story remained the same throughout the project's history, as Trevorrow believed the next logical step for the franchise would be for campers to encounter dinosaurs following the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. To maintain secrecy on the project, no auditions or casting calls were held. A casting director who knew Trevorrow helped lead a secretive search for the child actors. The film marked Melody Hurd's acting debut. Trevorrow chose Andr√© Holland and Natalie Martinez as he admired their acting in other films. =Filming= Filming took place in Ireland in January 2019. Filming locations included Powerscourt Estate. Ireland was chosen as redwood trees outside Dublin resembled national parks in northern California. Filming took place with a small crew over the course of five days. Larry Fong was the film's cinematographer. Much of the film was shot using a hand-held camera, as Trevorrow wanted to see if audiences would accept such a filmmaking style in a Jurassic Park film, which he later felt they did. Industrial Light & Magic created CGI dinosaurs for the film, as well as reference maquettes, while John Rosengrant of Legacy Effects created an animatronic Allosaurus. The film had a much smaller budget than the full films in the Jurassic Park franchise. Originally, the film was going to be shorter than eight minutes. After filming concluded, Trevorrow decided to add end- credit scenes depicting dinosaurs. Because he could not film any new scenes, he instead searched through YouTube videos that could be integrated into the film. The rights to each of the online videos were purchased for use in the short film, and dinosaurs were then added into the videos. Music Amie Doherty composed the film's score. Doherty was contacted in October 2018 about composing Battle at Big Rock. She met with Trevorrow in December 2018, and was chosen to compose the film. After filming concluded, Doherty's score changed slightly over the next four months as the film underwent editing. Doherty said the score was mainly tightened to fit in with the events depicted in the film. The musical recording process took place at Abbey Road Studios, where an 80-piece orchestra recorded the score in May 2019. Release The short film was initially scheduled to accompany the theatrical release of Universal's Hobbs & Shaw in August 2019. On September 10, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead premiere on FX on September 15. Trevorrow was surprised at the amount of secrecy maintained on the project up until the announcement.

It is part of the Jurassic Park franchise and debuted on Netflix on September 18, 2020. Set before, during and after the events of the film Jurassic World, the series follows six teenagers who become stranded on Isla Nublar after multiple dinosaurs escape their habitats. Following its release, the show was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics, who applauded the diverse voice cast but criticized the show's character designs, and writing. Aaron Hammersley serves as showrunner alongside Scott Kreamer. In October 2020, the series was renewed for a second season set to premiere in 2021.

Episodes  =Season 1 (2020)=  Production  In mid-2018, Scott Kreamer took over a premise and pilot script by Zack Stentz and began to work on the show's early design. In 2019, it was announced that a Jurassic World CGI-animated series would debut on Netflix in 2020. A joint project between Netflix, Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and DreamWorks Animation, Scott Kreamer, Lane Lueras, and Aaron Hammersley worked together as the series' showrunners. They executive-produced the series along with Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, and Colin Trevorrow, while Stentz served as a series developer and as a consulting producer. Spielberg did not want the series to be a \\"kiddy version\\" of the Jurassic Park films, insisting that the young characters be placed in dangerous scenarios, as in the films. Kreamer and Hammersley joined the project after it was greenlit, and they shared Spielberg's vision. The three were inspired by various Spielberg films which often depicted children facing danger. Unlike the Jurassic Park films, in which children are secondary characters rescued by adults, the series instead focuses on the teenagers and their efforts to survive on their own. The role of Dave was written specifically for Powell. Programs such as V-Ray, Autodesk Maya, and Nuke were used to create the series. The COVID-19 pandemic began during production, and the series crew had to work from home as a result. The series features original music composed by Leo Birenberg, using themes from the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World soundtracks, composed by John Williams and Michael Giacchino respectively. On October 9, 2020, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, set to be released in 2021. DreamWorks Animation also stated that the second season had already been completed prior to its renewal, and revealed the return of Sean Giambrone as Ben, who was presumably killed in the first season, as well as the return of the Ceratosaurus, who appeared briefly in Jurassic Park III.  Marketing  On July 28, 2020, Netflix released a teaser trailer for the series, which was followed by the release of an official trailer on September 1, 2020, and an interactive site filled with games for children. Additionally, it was announced that Mattel would produce toys based on the series.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 73% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 6.43/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"With a spirited group of campers and exciting new adventures, Camp Cretaceous successfully evolves the Jurassic World franchise for younger viewers - though it may be a bit too violent for some.\\" Writing for Bloody Disgusting, Meagan Navarro called the series \\"the perfect Amblin mix of funny, touching, and daring\\", praising the voice cast and the dinosaur designs, but calling the character designs generic. Jesse Hassenger from The A.V. Club gave the series a grade rating of a C+, calling the show unrealistic and stating that \\"Camp Cretaceous isn‚Äôt especially astute in terms of teenage sociology, but it is clever about portraying the tween-to-teen age where a lot of kids find their dinosaur obsession diminishing.\\" From Collider, Haleigh Foutch gave the series a rating of an A-, lauding the \\"believable high stakes, strong character arcs, and some genuinely thrilling set-pieces.\\" Alana Joli Abbott of Den of Geek gave the series a rating of four stars out of five, applauding the animation, cast, and central story in the show. From the Los Angeles Times, Robert Lloyd wrote: Empire journalist Ben Travis gave the series a rating of two stars out of five, criticizing the \\"deeply unlikeable characters\\" and forced writing. Travis, who was also impressed by the dinosaur animations, called out the show's characters who he stated were \\"drawn in thin stereotypes and forced dialogue\\". He concluded that the series \\"disappointingly limits its own appeal to younger viewers only.\\" On the other side of the spectrum, Beth Elderkin of io9 found the series to be excessively violent, pointing out that \\"not an episode goes by without at least one kid being put in mortal danger, and that includes before the park goes to hell.\\" However, she noted the consistency throughout the series, stating that \\"it's rare to find a modern children's show that trusts its audience to handle more intense subject material. In that sense, it's something to admire‚Äîeven if it's unsettling at times.\\" Having watched the first episode, the crew at Decider hesitantly recommended viewers to stream the series.

It was recorded in April 1978https://www.discoverkarajan.com/#/discover/recordings/UmVjb3JkaW5nOjE3MTE= and released in 1979. Background The album includes the Act 4 arias for Marcellina and Basilio which some other recordings omit. In Act 3 of the opera, the Sextet has traditionally been performed after the Count's recitative and aria \\"Hai gi√† vinta la causa!... Vedr√≤ mentr'io sospiro\\" snd before the Countess's recitative and aria \\"E Susanna non vien!... Dove sono\\". In 1963, Robert Moberly and Christopher Raeburn suggested that this sequence entailed defects in the opera's storyline, and conjectured that originally Mozart and da Ponte had placed the Sextet after the Countess's number, not before it. They pointed out that at the premi√®re of the opera, Antonio and Bartolo had been performed by the same singer, and argued that the score might have been rearranged to give him the opportunity to change his costume. Herbert von Karajan adopted the Moberly-Raeburn sequence when conducting Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's new staging of the opera at the Salzburg Festival in 1973, and adhered to it when he made the present album (of which Raeburn was the producer).W. A. Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro, cond. Herbert von Karajan, Decca CD, 421 125-2, 1988 Although it is a studio recording, the album derived from a theatrical production. In May 1977, a year before the album was taped, Bastin, Berbi√©, Cotrubas, van Dam, Equiluz, K√©l√©m√©n, Krause, von Stade, Tomowa-Sintow and Zednik performed Le nozze di Figaro at the Vienna State Opera under von Karajan's direction. (An Austrian Radio recording of one of their performances was released on CD in 2012 by Orfeo (catalogue number C856 123D)).Gramophone, August 2012, p. 84 Recording The album was recorded using analogue technology in April and May 1978 in the Sofiensaal, Vienna. Critical reception =Reviews= Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, circa 1780 The musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in September 1979. It had a very strong roster of soloists, he thought, even if they did not mine quite as much meaning from Lorenzo da Ponte's libretto as they would have done if they had been Italian. Tom Krause was the more successful of the Almavivas, singing with \\"plenty of weight and virility\\", powerfully conveying the \\"rage, frustration and wounded social pride\\" that consumed the priapic Count after his failure to seduce his servant's fianc√©e. Sadie could not recall another artist who had expressed the Count's lust so potently. As his dignified wife, Anna Tomowa-Sintow sang with a voice that was \\"rich, glowing [and] spacious\\", but perhaps not as lissom or accurate as the bel canto ideal. Jos√© van Dam's Figaro was every bit as impressive as his master. Van Dam was meticulous in his attention to every nuance both of Figaro's music and of its dramatic context, attending to even the smallest minutiae with the utmost conscientiousness. Like Tomowa-Sintow, Ileana Cotrubas was somewhat outshone by her partner. Her singing was lovely in its limpidity and refinement, but she seemed downcast and numb rather than the lively personality that she generally was. The singers in the secondary roles fared better. Christiane Barbaux was a \\"pleasantly clear\\" Barbarina, Jules Bastin a \\"well articulated\\" Bartolo, Jane Berbi√© a \\"neat\\" if occasionally strained Marcellina, Heinz Zednik a \\"capable if not imaginative\\" Basilio and Frederica von Stade \\"a model of clear and straightforward singing\\" as Cherubino. The orchestra's contribution was laudable in some respects, disappointing in others. The Vienna Philharmonic's strings were \\"very rich, smooth and beautiful\\", but its woodwinds were too anodyne to satisfactorily express the commentary on the drama that Mozart had written for them. As for Herbert von Karajan's conducting of his \\"elusive, indeed indistinct\\" interpretation, there was little to be said in its favour. It was true that his recitativo secco was unusually imaginative in its abrupt variations of pacing and dynamics. But otherwise his influence was unhappy. He seemed to have inhibited his singers from performing their roles in the way that they would have preferred to, and he had chosen some highly unorthodox tempi for no discernible reason. His eccentric speeds might not \\"actually distress\\" listeners, but neither would they help anyone to understand the opera more deeply. The album's engineering too was less than ideal, providing a convincingly theatrical stereo soundstage but offering an anachronistic \\"sleek and rounded\\" audio with a reverberant acoustic and a balance that favoured strings over woodwinds and instruments over singers. In sum, despite all its good ingredients, the album was not one that could be recommended. It was \\"too bland, too concerned with a smoothly polished surface, too little alive to the quicksilver of Mozart's score\\". Gramophone, September 1979, pp. 513-514 J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in October 1979. He largely agreed with Sadie about the strength of Decca's cast. Ileana Cotrubas was \\"delightful\\" as Susanna. Tom Krause and Jos√© van Dam both sang with a \\"fine tone\\" that some of their competitors lacked. Frederica von Stade was \\"excellent throughout\\", and notably sang a \\"Non so pi√π\\" very different from the exuberant performance on her bel canto recital disc,Mozart & Rossini Arias with \\"the voice caressing and yearning to an accompaniment of gentle murmurs and subdued ardours and excitements\\". Anna Tomowa-Sintow alone was something of a disappointment, sometimes lapsing into \\"tremulous\\" singing that was unexpected from an artist with such a high reputation. Where Steane differed from Sadie was in his assessment of Karajan's contribution to the album. He was impressed by Karajan's \\"special touch\\", and in particular by the considered way in which the conductor had distinguished between unguarded conversation and conspiratorial asides in Mozart's recitativo secco. The recording was, he argued, a performance rich in light and shade and one with \\"a great deal to say\\". It was, all in all, \\"a Figaro full of life and insight: hearing it is a special event\\".Gramophone, October 1979, p. 587 James Goodfriend reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in December 1979. He admired its singers even more than his British counterparts had done, deeming them, if not better than their greatest predecessors, at least worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as them. In the title role, Jos√© van Dam was \\"splendid\\". Ileana Cotrubas's Susanna was \\"certainly the best thing I've heard her do on records\\". Tom Krause's \\"slight inherent musical stiffness\\" actually helped him to play Almaviva. Anna Tomowa-Sintow was \\"musically lovely and believable\\" as the Countess, although not as aristocratic as would have been ideal. Frederica von Stade was excellent in her signature role of Cherubino. \\"She not only has the voice for the part, and the musical intelligence, but the very character aligns perfectly with her temperament. She is infinitely more convincing here than in the Jennie Tourel [French] repertoire.\\" All the lesser roles were sung more or less perfectly too, and Konrad Leitner's harpsichord continuo was uncommonly creative. The Vienna Philharmonic played from the heart in the kind of performance that had led some critics to hail them as the finest orchestra in the world. The album's audio quality was first rate. Taken as a whole, the recording was even better than the benchmark version conducted by Erich Kleiber. It was \\"a great musical achievement, and the very consistency and elegance of its musical style tell us unmistakably that it is Karajan's achievement\\".Stereo Review, December 1979, p.87 A statue of Herbert von Karajan outside his birthplace in Salzburg, Austria Alan Blyth reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in July 1988, comparing it with a new version of the opera conducted by Bernard HaitinkW. A. Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro, cond. Bernard Haitink, EMI CD, CDS 49753-2, 1988 The \\"affecting delicacy\\" of Ileana Cotrubas's Susanna was the only element of Karajan's album that he singled out for praise. Jos√© van Dam had sung Figaro well, but not as well as when he had recorded the opera under Neville Marriner for Philips.W. A. Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro, cond. Neville Marriner, Philips CD, 416 370-2, 1986 The Countess of Anna Tomowa-Sintow was \\"less secure of pitch and tone\\" than Haitink's Felicity Lott's. The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra was \\"too comfortable and well-upholstered\\" for an opera that would be heard to better advantage played on period instruments. Karajan had perpetrated a reading of the opera that was \\"unstable\\", and in which \\"speeds are often eccentric and the excellent cast seems cowed by the conductor's dominance\\".Gramophone, July 1988, pp. 197-198 Richard Lawrence noted the album briefly in a survey of the Le nozze di Figaro discography in Gramophone's 2011 Awards issue. Like Blyth, he found little in the album to celebrate, mentioning only Frederica von Stade's \\"winning\\" Cherubino. He was irked by the dramatically informed handling of recitativo secco that had earlier been remarked by Steane. \\"Van Dam's secretive whispering when plotting with Susanna and the Countess in Act 2 becomes irritating with repeated hearing.\\"Gramophone, Awards Issue 2011, p. 72 =Accolade= In the December 1979 issue of Stereo Review, the album was included in the magazine's list of \\"Best Recordings of the Month\\".

The temple no longer exists, but the temple grounds were designated as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 1965. Overview The site consists of the ruins of a temple complex located about 3.5 kilometers southeast of JR Shizuoka Station, which was discovered during highway construction in 1930. The precincts measure approximately 160 meters square. The ruins dates from the late 8th century to the early 10th century (late Nara period to early Heian period). The site was partially excavated in 1948 and again in 1958, during which time the foundations of a Kond≈ç, K≈çd≈ç (Lecture Hall) and Rectory were discovered. The Kond≈ç was a 7x4 bay hall, measuring 30.9 meters by 17 meters. The K≈çd≈ç was also a 7x4 bay hall, measuring 25,5 meters by 15.8 meters. The rectory had 23 cells, with an estimated length of between 68.2 and width of between 9.1 and 10.9 meters. From the layout of the ruins and its large size, a theory was advanced that this was the site of the lost kokubun- ji of Suruga Province, although due to the lack of a pagoda, a theory was also advanced that the temple was the private monastery of a great landholder in ancient Udo Country. The discovery of the foundations of a pagoda in 2009 further reinforced the possibility that the ruin is that of a kokubun-ji. A large refuse pile was discovered approximately 500 meters south of the temple ruins which was found to contain a large number of roof tiles from the abandoned temple. This refuse pile was added to the National Historic Site designation in 1974. The temple appears to have been destroyed by a fire at some unknown time. The preservation of the site is poor, as it is located underneath an overpass of the T≈çmei Expressway and a prefectural road cuts through the ruins.

It flows through largely unspoiled wilderness, and has spectacular falls nears its mouth. Although there is hydroelectric potential, projects to develop the river in this way have met popular resistance, and instead it has been proposed to protect the river with a national part or indigenous reserve. Course The Manitou River has its origin in Lac Caobus in the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me, Minganie Regional County Municipality, and lower down flows through the municipality of Rivi√®re-au- Tonnerre, Minganie. The river flows south, widening in two places to form Lake Manitou and Eudist Lake. It reaches the Saint Lawrence in the Canton de Coopman, near the community of Manitou halfway between Sept-√éles and Havre- Saint-Pierre. The river basin lies between that of the Tortue River to the west and the Chaloupe River to the east. The river is long, with an average flow of . It has a basin of . Three falls with heights of , and have hydroelectric potential of 40, 30 and 20 megawatts respectively. There was a proposal in May 2001 to build 36 small (less than 50 MW) hydroelectric power stations on rivers throughout Quebec, including the Manitou. Due to popular pressure, most of the projects were abandoned. It has been proposed to instead make it a national park, or else a reserve, since the territory is claimed by the Innu. Name The name is based on the belief among several indigenous people that the manitou represents the powers of life, and is the great spirit, and that the manitou is in the waterfall. The phrase Tch√©-Manitou means \\"good spirit\\" while Matchi-Manitou means \\"bad spirit\\" or \\"devil\\". Manitou is the French form of the word, while the English used the forms manitto, manetto or manitoa. The name is common throughout Quebec except in the region south of the Saint Lawrence, and is even found in Inuit territories in the hydbrid form Manitounuk. The toponym \\"Manitou River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Manitou River Chute Manitou The coastal plain in this area is about above sea level. Less than from its mouth the river descends through falls high. There is a tourist information center at the Chute Manitou, with a parking lot and picnic tables. At the fall the river is flanked on either side by trails through the boreal forest. The La Chute trail, which goes down to the bottom of the falls, has wooden stairs in places and landings giving views of the falls at different levels, including one with a height of almost . A small part of the trail passes over a red granite beach. The trails to the falls were closed in June 2017 for safety-related improvements. River basin The Manitou River basin is elongated from north to south, with a length of about and average width upstream of . Lower down the basin is narrower. The basin is divided between the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Nipissis in the Sept-Rivi√®res RCM (9.4%), and the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me (88.7%) and the municipality of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre (1.9%) in the Miganie RCM. The coastal plain is about wide. Along the southern shore there is a steep escarpment. North of that the plain is fairly flat, with altitudes between . Above this there is a piedmont area that extends for upstream, with average altitude rising from in the south to in the north. The piedmont has steep rounded hills up to above sea level, rising above water levels. North of the piedmont the Laurentian plateau region covers more than half the watershed. It contains massifs with undulating reliefs and altitudes of . Mount Manitou, which also contains part of the Tortue River watershed, has an elevation of . Waterfall on the river The bedrock includes eight types of magmatic or metamorphosed rock complexes: mixed paragneiss, granite and pegmatite, anorthosite, granitoid rocks, granodiorite and charnockite gneisses, gabbro and migmatite. The bedrock on the plateau and piedmont is covered only by a thin and discontinuous layer of undifferentiated deposits that rarely is more than thick. However, there are significant layers of glacial tills and glaciofluvial sediments in the alluvial valleys. In the coastal plain the Goldthwait Sea, which advanced after the last ice age and then retreated when the land rebounded from the weight of the ice, left large quantities of clay and silt sediments. These were later covered by deltaic sandy sediments. Hydrology The streams and rivers in the north follow angular courses dictated by fractures in the hard bedrock, with straight line segments meeting at right angles. Valleys are typically V-shaped, rising up to from water level. In the center the courses become more winding, and sometimes meander, as they flow through old U-shaped glacial valleys. In the coastal plain the Manitou River has cut a straight valley through the soft sediments. The estuary is a bay long and wide, closed at the mouth by a long sandy spit with a small opening into the Gulf. The river runs for from north to south, with a vertical fall of . The average annual flow at its mouth is estimated at , ranging from during the year. There are three large falls in the lower section of the river: the high Grosse Chute, from the river mouth, and the Aubin and Wallace falls respectively and from the river mouth. Tributaries include the Lavaivre River, which drains the northwest of the watershed, the Lloyd and Trout rivers, which drain the west-central portion and the Little Manitou River, which drains the east-central portion. Waterbodies cover 9.99% of the basin. There are three large lakes. Aigle Lake in the north covers , with an irregular shape. The Lake Manitou in the center-south of the basin is almost long but only wide, formed by flooding an old glacial valley with steep sides that rise to over in places. Eudist Lake in the south covers . Environment Another of the waterfalls The coastal plain extends up to from the river mouth and contains a large number of peat bogs, although only three are more than . Further north, peat bogs are found only in the foot of valleys, and are mostly uniform and covered by shrubs. In the north, the section on the Canadian Shield is partly covered by fens. The forest has never been exploited except in a small area in 1910‚Äì1920, which is now colonized with hardwood. Otherwise the vegetation is typical of the region. There was a large fire to the east of Lake Aigle, date unknown, that burned more than . There was another large fire along the railway in 1961‚Äì1970. The number of fish species is estimated at 27. The river does not have the status of a salmon river, although the fish may enter the river estuary below the falls. It is estimated that up to 139 species of birds may nest in the watershed, taking advantage of the vast peat bogs of the coastal plain and the stretches of still water. Cliffs near the Eudistes, and Manitou lakes also provide potential habitat for birds of prey. A 2008 study identified potential for canoeing or kayaking down the river from upstream of Lake Manitou, upstream, to Eudistes Lake, upstream. Access would be by float plane, and camping sites would have to be prepared.

In a letter he told his friend Spencer that she was not attractive, but she was true, caring, strong, and selfless. Her wealth was not a motive for John to marry Tyndall for her father died in 1884 and left her very little money from his estate. The two enjoyed time outside of the lab and calculations as well. They enjoyed hiking and climbing mountains together. Tyndall especially enjoyed hiking the Alps, where they had a chalet. The summer after they got married, the couple climbed Aletschhorn which is nearly 14,000 ft. They moved to live together in Hindhead, a village in Surrey, England.  Career  Tyndall worked with John for 17 years and in that time, helped him closely with his research and writing. She assisted him in the laboratory, took notes, and helped write \\"our recent observations for the Philosophical Magazine\\". She had an excitement for experimenting and some of her work turned out to be very successful. Despite these successes, Tyndall's name did not make it on any paper because she was contributing at a time in which women were not viewed as capable of coming up with their own scientific discoveries. Tyndall is the main reason that the world has significant information about John Tyndall and his life. She was considered to be a silent member of the editing contributions for Correspondence because her impact remained nameless.  Later Life  Tyndall died in 1940 at the age of 95. She outlived John by 47 years and throughout their time together, they had no children. John died from being accidentally given the wrong amount of medicine by Tyndall, which caused him to overdose on chloral hydrate. John had been using chloral hydrate to treat his insomnia for some time before the incident. Tyndall gave him the dose because he was sick and bedridden. After his death on December 4, 1893, she worked on writing his biography until she died in 1940. After John's death, Tyndall refused to publish a biography of his work until all of his research was organized and finalized. It took Tyndall to die in 1940 for John's biography to be published in 1945. Tyndall gave permission to A. S. Eve and C. H. Creasey to publish the biography before she died. She is the reason that there is a detailed record of John's life and work.

It was located in what is now part of the city of Izunokuni, Shizuoka in the T≈çkai region of Japan. There were once many daikansho located in various parts of Japan serving a similar function, and this is one of the few which remains in relatively intact. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2004. Overview The Nirayama daikansho administrated all of Izu Province (which was completely tenry≈ç territory), as well as large portions of Suruga, Sagama and Musashi Provinces, as well as a portion of Kai Province and the Izu islands. Its kokudaka fluctuated at several points in its history, but was estimated to be at around 50,000 to 100,000 koku. The Niiraya daikansho was headed by a hereditary daikan, equivalent to a hatamoto from the Egawa clan (except for a period from 1723-1758). The head of this clan always took the name of Egawa Tar≈ç Uzaemon. The Egawa were a samurai clan who claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji who controlled central Izu since the Heian period. Similar to the daimy≈ç, they also maintained a residence in Edo (located in Honj≈ç). However, unlike the daimy≈ç, they were not subject to sankin k≈çtai, but alternated residence between Edo in summer and Nirayama in winter. As the shogunal territories under their administration were scattered across a wide area, secondary offices were established at various locations for administrative and tax collection purposes.. In 1596, Tokugwa Ieyasu appointed Egawa Hidenaga (1560-1639) as daikan of half of Izu Province, with the remainder under the Mishima daikansho. The two offices were united to form the Niirayama daikansho in 1633. However, in 1723, Egawa Hidekatsu was found guilty of embezzling public funds intended for repairs to the T≈çkaid≈ç at Totsuka and was relieved of his office. The clan regained the post in 1758; however, its scope of authority after this date was limited only to Izu Province, which it continued to govern until the Meiji restoration.

Giblin is a marine biologist who researches the cycling of elements nitrogen, sulfur, iron and phosphorus. She is a Senior Scientist and Acting Director of the Ecosystem Center at the Marine Biological Lab.  Education  Giblin earned her Bachelor of Science in Biology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, NY in 1975. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in ecology at the Boston University Marine Program, in Woods Hole, MA, in 1982. Giblin did her graduate work in the Massachusetts Great Sippewissett Marsh, studying trace metal solubility in salt marsh sediments which were contaminated with sewage sludge.  Career and research  Gilbin's research primarily focuses on the cycling of elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, iron, and phosphorus in the environment. The majority of Giblin's research is focused around the circulation of these elements in different redox (reduction-oxidation) conditions in soils and sediments. Another dominant theme in her work is to comprehend if sediment processes act as a buffer or act to exacerbate anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the environment. For example, much of her work focuses on the nitrogen cycle, and the effects ecosystems may have if there are high nutrient inputs from wastewater or fertilizer. Gilbin is the lead PI of the Plum Island Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research Site (PIE LTER). The Plum Island Ecosystems is composed of estuaries and watersheds located in northeastern Massachusetts. The three rivers that make up the ecosystem are the Ipswich River, Parker River, and the Rowley River. The goal of this research site is to develop an understanding of the long-term effect's sea-level rise linked to climate change may have on the watershed. The knowledge gathered through this research site is used in policy and land management with the initiative to protect the natural resources of the coastal zone. Giblin is also works at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (ARC LTER). The project is located on the north slope of Alaska. Similar to PIE LTER, this project was created to study anthropogenic as well as natural environmental change on ecosystems. Giblin conducted a long-term fertilization experiment in a pair of lakes and observed their recovery, to anticipate the effects of what will happen with a longer growing season. Data from this project could inform the management of the landscape. Giblin has also worked have had to do with acid deposition on the sulfur cycle of lakes, the movement of trace metals in salt marsh sediments, nitrogen inputs and hydrologic disturbances to estuaries and Arctic lakes.

Biography  Gregory was born on 10 October 1876 to Eugene and Oceanna Everett Brooks. The family lived in Washington, D.C., where Musette attended public school. While living in Washington, D.C., Gregory was a principal's clerk and the supervisor of first-year work for the 13th District public schools. As a clerk, Gregory was exposed to teaching, and would later become a teacher herself. Gregory was also very involved in community service. She held leadership positions in the Music School Settlement in New York and was a member of the board of the Old Folks‚Äô Home of Newark. She was a member and ex-President of the Phyllis Wheatley Literary Society of Newark. On June 23, 1904, Gregory married Eugene Monroe Gregory, a Harvard University graduate. While Musette Gregory was teaching, Eugene Gregory was enrolled in Columbian University (now George Washington University) to study law. Originally, the couple lived in Trenton, but they moved to Newark in 1910. They had no children. Gregory died on July 26, 1921, in New York. Because of her significant achievements with civil rights and suffrage, the Federation of Colored Women‚Äôs Clubs named a scholarship after her. New Jersey Women's Suffrage Group  Suffrage work  Throughout her career, Gregory was involved with several women‚Äôs organizations, especially in New Jersey. In addition to her work in New Jersey, she actively worked alongside social services in New York. In 1919, she attended a rally in New Jersey, where she was elected to the executive committee for the New Jersey Suffrage Ratification Committee. The goal of the NJSRC was to help elect men that supported the 19th amendment. They wanted them to be in office before and during the election to get more voters. The NJSRC worked in partnership with organizations such as the New Jersey Suffrage Association, the State Federation of Women‚Äôs Club, the State Federation of Colored Women‚Äôs Club, and the State Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Movement. In addition to her suffrage work, Gregory was the superintendent of the Working Girls‚Äô Home in New York.  Civil rights work  The Cathedral of St. John the Divine Civil rights work was important to Gregory. She became the secretary and chairman of the executive board for the New Jersey Foundation of Colored Women‚Äôs Clubs, the oldest African-American secular organization in existence today. This organization is committed to addressing the needs of black women. One of Gregory's main projects was her work with the Colored Mission of the Diocesan Auxiliary of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, where she became the superintendent. Under this mission, she worked at the Home for the Working Girls at 132 West 131st Street, New York City, where she helped protect young working class African-American girls. The mission helped keep them out of prostitution by preparing them for work with cooking, sewing, and housekeeping. They also provided the girls counseling. Gregory was highly involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, becoming the Vice President of the Newark Branch.

Cardon is an American ecosystems ecologist focused on observing and understanding ecosystem interactions in the rhizosphere. She has also played an integral role in developing systems to better study the rhizosphere without digging it up and interfering with the ecosystems using stable isotopes and mathematical modeling. Cardon is currently a senior scientist at the Marine Biology Laboratory at the Ecosystems Center and an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University. She is credited with helping to establish the National Microbiome Initiative at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in Washington, D.C.  Early life and education  Cardon was born in Logan, Utah to parents Guy Cardon and Vera Johnson, owners of the Bluebird Restaurant and Candy Co. She grew up playing the piano, performing as a soloist in the Utah Symphony and the USU Orchestra. She has also won four piano competitions at the Utah State Fair, and has published poetry.In 1988, she graduated with a B.S in Biology and a B.A in Spanish from Utah State University as valedictorian in the College of Science and Scholar of the Year in the university's Robins Awards. She went on to receive her Ph.D in Biological Sciences at Stanford University in 1994. She completed her education by conducting research as a DOE Global Change Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.  Career and research  Cardon began as an assistant professor at Bowdoin College for only a year (1996-1997) before moving on to the University of Connecticut (UConn), where she received an Outstanding Advisor Award for her enthusiasm and accessibility as an advisor and assistant professor. One of her advisees, Andy Czaja, said of Cardon, \\"Zoe is always willing to help, no matter what she's doing. A lot of times, she'll offer help even without asking. She sends e-mail, saying 'I was thinking about your project, what about this?'\\" She worked at UConn until 2005, eventually becoming head of the Biology Honors Program. In 2002, Cardon was awarded the Sarah and Daniel Hrdy Visiting Fellowship in Conservation Biology at Harvard University, which is awarded to distinguished individuals who will work within and study in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. Cardon currently serves as a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory at the Ecosystems Center in Woods Hole, MA. She is also a professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University. Cardon's research focuses largely on the rhizosphere and interactions between the micro- and macro-organisms within it. Her work employs many disciplines and perspectives in order to understand how these interactions facilitate the movement of resources in these systems, and can be applied more broadly to any ecosystem where micro and macro-organisms shape their physical environments.  Publications  Cardon's research focuses largely on interactions within the rhizosphere and understanding the complex relationships between microbes, plants, and soils. Her research is highly influential and she has published in many peer reviewed journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Soil Biology and Biochemistry, Journal of Cell Science, Plant Physiology, and more.

Concept Since ancient times, a tree made into a reverse pillar is said to cause things like yanari to occur at night. Besides making family fortunes decline, they were also said to cause unfortunate events such as fires, so they were greatly detested. The y≈çkai comic artist Mizuki Shigeru said that a reversed pillar would be a source of tree leaves y≈çkai, or that the pillar itself would turn into a y≈çkai. In Saikaku Oridome (Ë•øÈ∂¥ÁπîÁïô), a piece of writing by Ihara Saikaku, a couple that lived in a house in front of the Kyoto Rokkaku-d≈ç was tormented by this sakabashira paranormal phenomenon, and it is said that the sound of shattering beams would echo every night in that house, which led them to eventually move elsewhere. Also, in Odawara, it is said that a certain merchant was in the middle of a celebration when there was a voice that could be heard saying \\"my neck hurts,\\" and upon looking for the source of the voice, it turned out that the voice came from the pillar in the zashiki (guest room), which is how the merchant knew that this pillar was a reverse pillar (sakabashira). Reversed pillars that ward against calamity It is known that there is a reversed pillar at the gate Y≈çmeimon at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´. This is because among the pillars, only one has its engraving patterns reversed, which is how it is known to be a reversed pillar. This is not reversed by mistake, but rather a trick in order to avoid the legend that \\"once the structure is complete, it will then start to collapse,\\" so it is said that the building was intentionally left incomplete in order to avoid disaster, meaning that this reverse pillar was for warding against calamity. Furthermore, this is a completely different thing from the reversed pillars in y≈çkai legends. According to the Kamakura period Tsurezuregusa, something that is perfect is never good, so when building a dairi, one spot will be left not fully built. It is said that in the Edo Period, people said to \\"leave it three tiles unfinished.\\"È´òËó§Êô¥‰øäËëó„ÄåÊù±ÁÖßÂÆÆÂÜçÁô∫Ë¶ã„ÄçÊó•ÂÖâÊù±ÁÖßÂÆÆÁ§æÂãôÊâÄ„ÄÅ1996Âπ¥Â¢óË£úÊîπË®ÇÁâà„ÄÅp50 File:NikkoPillarL9701.jpgThe pattern on a pillar at the Y≈çmeimon at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ File:NikkoPillar9741.jpgThe reverse pillar at Y≈çmeimon.

County Hall, which is the headquarters of Northamptonshire County Council, is a Grade II* listed building. The building is adjacent to the former Sessions House which is now used as a Tourist Information Centre. History The building is an 18th-century house which was rebuilt to a design by James Milne in 1845. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became the meeting place of Northamptonshire County Council. It was re-modeled to a design by Edmund Law to accommodate a council chamber in 1890 and further altered to a design by Sir Aston Webb to create more meeting rooms in 1900. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing George Row; the four left hand bays contained round headed sash windows and right hand bay featured a wooden doorway; each of the bays was flanked by Tuscan order pilasters on the ground floor; there were five sash windows with alternating segmental and triangular pediments flanked by Ionic order half columns on the first floor. The principal rooms were the council chamber and a reception room know as the \\"Octagon room\\". During the course of the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century, as the administrative responsibilities of the county council grew, it acquired or leased some twelve additional buildings around the town until, in 2013, it decided to procure a single administration centre in which council officers and their departments would be co-located on a derelict site just south of County Hall at Angel Square. The building was designed by BDP, built by Galliford Try at a cost of ¬£53 million and officially opened by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Sajid Javid, in October 2017. The county council subsequently announced the sale and lease back of One Angel Square to Canada Life Investments, in order to raise funds for the provision of services, in February 2018. The county council announced in June 2018 that it was considering selling County Hall but the proposed transaction was subsequently abandoned. The county council continued to use the council chamber at County Hall as its meeting place.

Duvall was a member of the Klan. However, contemporarily, the election was considered to one of the most tame municipal elections in then-recent memory. Nominations Walter Meyers defeated A.G. Emhardt for the Democratic nomination. Duvall, a Klansman, defeated anti-Klan candidate Ralph Lemcke for the Republican nomination. Results Duvall won roughly 52,000 votes to Myers' roughly 43,000 votes. Duvall carried every ward except the city's 12th and 13th wards. Despite his being a Klansman, Duvall's victory was, in part, due to his carrying the predominantly African American 5th and 6th wards. Duvall, despite winning, underperformed in many wards compared to down-ticket Republicans. Voter turnout was considered to be low, with only 95,872 out of an estimated 150,000 registered voters participating in the municipal election. In the coinciding city council elections, which were voted at-large, six out of nine city council members elected were also pro-Klan Republicans.

His studio was located at 5, boulevard des Capucines, on the border between the 2nd and 9th arrondissements in the centre of Paris. Biography =Early life= Pierson became interested in photography while the medium was in its infancy in the early 1840s. He had a photography studio in Paris as early as 1844, and enjoyed a solid reputation. For many years he located his studio at 5, boulevard des Capucines, where he was associated with the Mayer brothers (L√©opold-Ernest Mayer and Louis-Fr√©d√©ric Mayer). At that address their company grew into a formidable enterprise. =Photographer of His Majesty the Emperor Napol√©on III= Initially using the daguerreotype, the Pierson-Mayer studio became one of the first to specialise in portrait photography retouched with watercolour or oils. The French Emperor Napol√©on III came to prefer their studio, particularly once he established the Second Empire in 1852. Pierson created numerous portraits of the French imperial family during the apex of Second Empire.John Hannavy, Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, . Between 1855 and 1862, at the peak of the Pierson-Mayer studio's prominence, people of all types came to have their pictures taken there, including the imperial court, the aristocracy, powerful businessmen, actresses and musicians. Pierson and the Mayer brothers photographed the kings of W√ºrttemburg, Portugal, and Sweden. Starting in 1862, their clientele became more varied, and by 1866, included people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. =Photographer of the Countess of Castiglione= Photograph of the Countess of Castiglione by Pierre-Louis Pierson in the 1860s. Pierson first met the Countess of Castiglione in 1856, and he would remain her official photographer for forty years. In 1867, Pierson exhibited his portrait of the Countess posed as the Queen of Hearts in the French section of photography at that year's Exposition Universelle in Paris. Pierson and the Countess began an intense photographer-model collaboration between 1861 and 1867, wherein she became a master of the art of mise-en-sc√®ne and developed roles of a madonna, battered woman, mother, and the high-styled woman dressed in extravagant outfits. In a playful atmosphere which was left largely to improvisation, the Countess, with Pierson's help, created many different personalities. Dresses, hairstyles, and attitudes were all studied to dramatic effect. Thanks to the effects of mirrors, she could present different conceptions of the self at the same time. Certain studies show her hair extended; others, cropped. Always at her disposal, Pierson photographed her exposed legs and feet, which were considered erotic imagery, very daring for the time. Nonetheless, during the Countess's lifetime these photos were hers and Pierson's secret. Between 1856 and 1895, the Countess posed for more than 450 portraits. This frenetic series of photos, quite rare for the time, was one of the first examples of the photographic self-portrait.La comtesse de Castiglione, beaut√© insolente et photographe secr√®te de sa vie (1837‚Äì1899) sur France-Culture.Pierre Apraxine Xavier, La Divine Comtesse: Photographs of the Countess de Castiglione, Demange. Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), New Haven ; London : Yale University Press, 2000.. =The Braun Company, 1878‚Äî1913= In 1878, Pierson went into partnership with his son-in-law Gaston Braun, the heir to the Braun Company and the brother-in-law of L√©on Cl√©ment. They managed to resurrect the Soci√©t√© Adolphe Braun et Compagnie from the brink of collapse. From then on, Pierson's photographic collection belonged to Braun. In 1883, the Braun company signed an exclusive 30-year contract with the Louvre with the goal of reproducing photographically some 7,000 works of art. The photographs deposited into the inventory of the museum became the property of the French state, and in exchange, the Braun company became the official photographers for the Louvre. In 1889, the company became Braun, Cl√©ment & Compagnie. Their working studio was rebuilt and completely electrified between 1897 and 1899. In 1910, the company was renamed Braun et Compagnie. By this time, the company had opened already a branch studio in New York and would open one in London the following year.

Established in 1901 as the band of the 15th Cavalry Regiment, it was inactivated in 1921, reactivated in 1942, and inactivated a final time in 2018. History The band was activated in February 1901 at the Presidio of San Francisco as the band of the 15th Cavalry Regiment. The band stood-down at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming on October 18, 1921, upon the inactivation of the 15th Cavalry. With the outbreak of World War II, it was reactivated with its regiment at Fort Riley, Kansas. On June 2, 1944, it was reorganized and redesignated as the 62nd Army Ground Forces Band and, in 1947, as the 62nd Army Band. In 2008 it received the Superior Unit Award. In 2011 the band was assigned to Fort Huachuca, Arizona. It was inactivated in 2018 and concluded its tour with a concert to which personnel formerly assigned to the band, as well as those assigned to bands that had previously been posted to Fort Huachuca, were invited to join or attend. The band's final performance was the national march of the United States, \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\", which was conducted by the commanding general of Fort Huachuca, Major General Robert P. Walters, Jr. Following the conclusion of the concert its colors were cased and sent to the Center for Military History for storage. At the time of its inactivation, it was the only active- duty military band in Arizona. Organization At the time of its inactivation, the band was authorized 37 personnel. It consisted of a ceremonial band and a chamber jazz group known as the Cannonball Combo, the latter named in tribute to Cannonball Adderley who was once posted to Fort Huachuca as a trumpet player in the 36th Army Band. By the time of its inactivation, it was estimated to have a maximum of 27 personnel.

It was officially opened on 1 December 2019. Background The building of the airport is part of a scheme to develop Noonu Atoll as a luxury tourist zone. The plan to construct an airport was first announced by President Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom in the 2000s, and the actual construction was initiated in 2017 by his brother Abdulla Yameen who succeeded him. The building of the airport was funded by Abu Dhabi Fund for Development of United Arab Emirates which provided a grant of US$60 million. It features a 2,200-meter runway that can handle commercial aircraft the size of Airbus A320s and the Boeing 737s. It was constructed by a Singaporean contractor, Tuff Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. Test flight at the airport began on 14 August 2018. Although not completed, the airport project was inaugurated by President Abdulla Yameen on 28 August 2018. After a series of delays, the airport was officially opened by Planning Minister Mohamed Aslam on 1 December 2019, allowing international flight operations at the airport to begin. Environmental Impact = Destruction of endangered turtle nesting grounds = The airport was built in an area that was a major nesting ground for endangered turtles as Maafaru has had a long history of being a popular nesting ground endangered turtles. On 9 April 2019, a green sea turtle that had come to Maafaru to lay its eggs, found the newly- constructed runway of a brand new airport instead, and ended up laying her eggs on the tarmac. The turtle later died from the injuries. = Illegal export of coconut palms = The Maldives Customs Service stopped the illegal export of coconut palm trees from the Maafaru island uprooted as a direct result of the airport project. Maafaru islanders alerted customs after the Environment Protection Agency stopped the illegal uprooting of trees from the island. = EPA halts airport expansion project = On 29 December 2019, the Maldivian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) halted the expansion project and rejected the Environmental Impact Assessment, giving the following reasons as justification in their report. # The aim of the project given as to accommodate Boeing 777 twinjet landing unfortunately is not a valid justification when compared to the long-term environmental and socio-economic negative impacts that would arise from this project. # The frequency of landing of large aircraft is expected to be minimal in the medium-term and the frequency of landing in the long-term is also unknown. # Reclamation works would lead to permanent loss of a large area of Maafaru lagoon, affecting the surrounding coral reef ecosystem. # Loss of lagoon space for future island expansion, while there is a high demand by the Island Council and community for excess land reclamation to compensate for the land being taken up for this expansion project. # Proposed dredging methodology (CSD) takes more time in operation and therefore time-frame for marine impacts is substantial. If the alternative methodology (TSHD) is to be used, the project footprint would expand outside Maafaru lagoon. # Sand borrow site for the reclamation has a rich sea-grass bed, which is a habitat for many juvenile marine lives as well as a sea-turtle grazing area. # Dredging the inner lagoon would result in turbidity and sedimentation as well as changes to the hydrodynamics which would most likely result in erosion and accretion of the unprotected coastal areas in the residential side of Maafaru, alternatively increasing the cost of the project as shore protection will be required. # Island is known for sea- turtle nesting, hence the loss of the grazing site as well as the turtle nesting beaches due to predictable erosion, from the activities of this project will have a direct negative impact on the marine life within the vicinity. # The airport expansion footprint will affect a total of 22,000 trees which is a major portion of the existing vegetation of the island. Furthermore, this area also contains plots allocation for residential buildings, pending constructions. Hence, if the compensation plots are to be allocated from the available land, on the other end of the island, that would mean the last remaining mature vegetation of the island would also be destroyed and Maafaru would be left barren of any of its original mature vegetation. (In the report it is stated that a maximum of 250 trees can be re- located within the island). Therefore, considering the huge cumulative impacts to the terrestrial vegetation, it would be impossible to mitigate such impacts in an island environment. # The proponent does not hold the legal ownership of the proposed project area, as per the Land Act (Act No. 1/2002). # The plan of compensation for the coconut palms and fruit bearing trees in the proposed project area within the island has not yet been decided.  Fraud and corruption allegations  The contractor for the project, Singaporean company Tuff Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. is facing multiple allegations including failing to pay their subcontractors, using deception and sham projects to win the bid, violations of contract, and inflated costs. As a result, the project was under audit from the Anti Corruption Commission of the Maldives. According to rumors, Regional Airports Director General Saamee Ageel is also accused of owning a private yacht which is currently being investigated by the Asset Recovery Commission of the Office of The President. Anti-Corruption Commission requested that the Regional Airports Deputy Director General Ahmed Mahreen be susupended. Anti-Corruption Commission also requested that payment to contractors for the Maafaru International Airport be suspended.  Public opposition to the project  There is online opposition to the expansion project including by the Maldivian environmentalist organisation SaveMaldives. The hashtag #SaveMaafaru has been used in regard to this opposition.  9/11 themed Eid celebration  The Az'ha Eid ‚Äòcelebrations‚Äô that took place on Maafaru in 2018 were criticised after photos of it appeared on Facebook. The images show men acting as terrorists armed with pretend rifles and a tower with a US flag on top of it. The finale features a plastic plane hanging from a wire and crashing into the tower, with smoke and fire billowing out. Young children can be seen looking on. The Facebook post with the images was later removed. The same spectacle has been held on the island for at least two consecutive years and was held before that too, according to the organizer. Facilities The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway which is in length and wide. The airport can accommodate six jets at any one time. The airport includes a passenger terminal and a VIP lounge, and is managed and maintained by the national airline Maldivian.

I mean, I wanted to hate it.\\" The interviewer, Andrew Limbong, described Gillis' set at the festival, writing: \\"Shane Gillis gives off post-jock energy‚Äîlike someone who used to play a sport in school, then had the self-awareness to realize he wasn't cut out for it and stopped‚Äîbut he isn't bitter about it at all.

Biography Kravchenko studied in Odessa's gymnasium in municipal Realschule and Odessa's school of fine arts, which he graduated from in 1888 with a silver medal. In the same year Kravchenko moved to Saint Petersburg and entered the class of battle painting at the Imperial Academy of Arts. He was immediately taken to the second course to Bogdan Willewalde. The collision with old professors and unwillingness to obey their daily requirements led the young artist to the realization that his further stay at the academy was useless. That's why he came back to Odessa. In 1891, Kravchenko went to Paris, where at the same time he worked in both Academie Julian and the Academie Colarossi. With the help of his friend, who then was studying in Ecole des beaux arts, Kravchenko drawings were shown to Professor Jerome, who willingly took him as a student. Lessons at French academy of fine arts didn't interfere with artist's work at home and drawing some portraits. One of them (Dr's. Brissot) was taken to the Salon Champs de Mars and attracted the attention of Paris press. In 1893 Kravchenko showed his sketch of a Russian girl student at the same salon.

His death in the sinking of the Brother Jonathan in July 1865 was one reason that the mint was never completed. On July 13, 1861, Logan was appointed a U.S. Indian agent under the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs by the administration of President Abraham Lincoln. He was the U.S. agent representative in the 1864 treaty with the Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin band of Snake Indians that created the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. A find of gold in October 23, 1861 led to a gold rush centered on The Dalles, then known as \\"Dalles City.\\" In 1864, the U.S. Congress agreed to establish a branch of the United States Mint in The Dalles to manage the flow of gold and help fund the ongoing American Civil War. In 1865, having established his reputation as an Indian agent, Logan was appointed the superintendent of the U.S. branch mint at The Dalles. He and his family were in San Francisco in 1865, and boarded the Brother Jonathan on July 28th to return to Oregon. Both William and his wife perished when the ship ran aground and sank on July 30th.

It opened in 1932 and closed in 1993, but campaigners are working to see it re-opened as a swimming pool. The lido is in Art Deco style, and is grade II listed. History and architecture The lido opened in 1932. The buildings were designed by Grange- over-Sands Urban District Council's surveyor, named Bernard Smith or Thomas Huddlestone. The lido sits on Grange promenade on the shore of Morecambe Bay, although the changing course of the River Kent means that the sea is at some distance from the promenade, separated by salt marsh. The pool was filled with filtered sea-water at high tide, and was unheated. The buildings are in Art Deco style. Historic Pools of Britain describes the lido as \\"A very fine intact Art Deco mushroom shaped lido in a stunning setting on the edge of Morecambe Bay\\". English Heritage state the reasons for the lido's grade II listing in 2011 as: Pevsner's The Buildings of England (revised ed. 2010), within its description of Grange promenade, simply says \\"Lido, 1933, closed 1992, and now very forlorn\\". The lido suffered damage from floods in 1977, when the outer wall was breached, but celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1982 with a special gala. Closure and future The lido closed in 1993, after a report suggested that necessary repairs would be too expensive to be justified. In 2011 the Save Grange Lido campaign was established, aiming to \\"transform it into a vibrant community owned leisure facility with a restored 50m pool at its heart.\\" The group has produced a detailed business plan setting out how it believes this could be achieved. It is a community benefit society. In 2015 South Lakeland District Council began to consider future uses for the site which would not include a swimming facility: the pool area was to become a \\"landscaped open space\\". In February 2019 the council allocated ¬£2million for \\"light touch refurbishment\\" of the lido, to include making it structurally sound, bringing it back into public use, and providing refurbished units for community groups or entrepreneurs.

The Hulan rises in the Lesser Khingan mountains, south of Yichun (). It flows west past Tieli and north of Suihua. After the confluence with the Tongken River, it turns south to join the Songhua River in Hulan County, where it flows into the new Dadingshan Reservoir, just east of Harbin (), . The river meanders extensively across the Northeast China Plain, creating many bifurcations and oxbow lakes. The approximate length is 350 km, but there is often more than one stream, and the actual distance including all the bends is 532 km. The area of the catchment basin is 31,207 km2. It has a wide floodplain of fertile black soil. After a comprehensive management plan for the river basin was implemented in the 1950s, it became a center of production for grain, flax and sugar beet. There is a tributary called the Xiaohulan River (Little Hulan), which flows northwest to join the main river west of Tieli. Other tributaries include the Yijimi, Ougen, Liu, Gemuke, Nuomin, Ni and Tongken Rivers.

In 2012, the fort was identified as part of the Bahrain pearling trail, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History The fort was constructed in 1840 although its origins likely come from a Portuguese fortification from the 16th century. An analysis of artefacts from the fort by an excavation team from Oxford Brookes University have suggested the site may have been first occupied from the Ummayad or early Abbasid era. There was also evidence of the site periodically being submerged underwater. The rectangular fort with four circular towers was built by Abdullah bin Ahmed Al Khalifa and served as a sister fort to Arad Fort, guarding the passageway of Muharraq Bay. In 1868, the fort was destroyed by British warships intervening in the Qatari‚ÄìBahraini War. The island and fort were partially restored in 1930 to serve as a quarantine station for smallpox. The fort was further reconstructed in the 1970s by a Bahraini archaeological team and further archaeological excavations have since been conducted as recently as 2010. At present, the fort consists of a solitary tower. Today The site is now adjacent a coast guard base and can be visited from the Bahrain National Museum by a short boat ride.

Career  After graduating in linguistics and Japanese at the University of Sheffield, Croydon started her professional life as a tax consultant for Arthur Andersen before returning to studies to complete a post graduate diploma in broadcast journalism at University of Westminster. She began her journalism career as a producer and breakfast newsreader for Silk FM radio station in Cheshire and then worked as a producer for ITN for five years before going freelance to focus on writing. In her early writing days she contributed mostly to The Times, The Sunday Times, The Independent and women's magazines focusing on relationship trends and dating. Her first scoop was an undercover piece for The Daily Mirror exposing an escort agency using YouTube to approach young girls and entice them into prostitution. She then became known for immersive journalism pieces, where she would partake in an event, sometimes undercover, and write about her findings. These include a Sunday Times article where she accompanied western men on a paid wife-finding tour in Ukraine, trying out steroids for The Times to expose their prevalence in London gyms, setting up a fake profile on an adultery website to hear the stories of men using them for an article for The Telegraph, and testing the world's most expensive bed for The Sunday Times.

He is known in the Spanish media for being the first notable politician of African descent elected from Vox. Personal life Garriga was born in Sant Cugat del Vall√®s to a Catalan father named Rafael of Belgian descent and an Equatoguinean mother named Clotilde. His mother is also of Portuguese descent through her father. Clotilde's parents, Mercedes and Pablo, owned a supermarket in Malabo, but after the death of Pablo, Mercedes sent Clotilde and her seven brothers to live in Barcelona. His father, Rafael Garriga Kuijpers, comes from a political family where both his father and brother (Ignacio's grandfather and uncle) were both involved in nationalistic organizations. Garriga is one of five children and grew up speaking Catalan as his first language. He considers himself 100% Spanish. Before becoming a politician Garriga worked as a dentist. He is married and has one daughter and three sons. He has also worked as a professor at the Faculty of Dentistry of the International University of Catalonia. Political career Garriga was previously a member of the People's Party, but left in 2010 after disagreements on the party's stance on gay marriage, abortion, Spanish unity, and immigration. Garriga joined Vox in 2014. Due to being the only black politician in the party he is sometimes described as the \\"Negro de Vox\\" or the \\"Black Man of Vox\\" although Garriga rejects this label. Despite his political party's strong anti-immigration stance, Garriga has made comments in support of immigrants in Spain as he himself is of immigrant descent, although he supports mandatory deportation of illegal immigrants. Garriga has claimed that Vox is Christian humanist, and the one political party in Spain that is the most accepting, despite the party's nationalistic rhetoric. While proudly identifying as Catalan, Garriga is strongly against the Catalan independence movement. Garriga was elected to the 13th Congress of Deputies in the April 2019 Spanish general election. He was re-elected to the 14th Congress of Deputies in the November 2019 Spanish general election. He is the leader for Vox in Barcelona.

It is 1.25 miles from Jura House on Jura.Haswell-Smith (2015) p.128 It is about 1/4 of a mile long and 1/4 of a mile wide. The earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was undertaken in the 16th century by Donald Monro in his 16th century Description of the Western Isles of Scotland. Brosdale is not mentioned by name although there is a laconic entry referring to a Hasil Iyle \\"which in the Erish is callit Ellan- na-Crawiche\\". R. W. Munro was unable to identify the location of Hasil Iyle but writing 40 years later Peter Youngson suggested that Monro was referring to Brosdale. He did not offer a specific explanation for his identification although Brosdale does lie between Am Fraoch Eilean to the west and Eilean nan Gabhar in the Small Isles of Jura to the north which are more readily identifiable.Youngson (2001) p.11 However, Matheson suggests that Monro's \\"Ellan charn\\" may be Brosdale Island.Matheson (1963) p. 49 Etymology Youngson simply notes that \\"this beautiful island seems to have had various different names during its history\\". Matheson, as evidence for his idea that Brosdale is Ellan charn, states that it \\"appears on an old map as Chreig Yl.?\\" and mentions that the modern name has \\"obviously been re-named after Brosdale on the mainland of Jura opposite\\". 'Brosdale' is clearly Norse in origin, dalr meaning valley. 'Bros' is harder to interpret but may be from brok, meaning \\"bad, black grass\\".Gillies (1906) p.244 Hasil Iyle/Ellan-na-Crawiche suggests a wooded island, whereas Monipennie suggests that Ellan charn takes its name \\"from a cairne of stones\\".Monipennie (1612) p. 184 Notes  Footnotes   References  * Gillies, H.

Born into a family of progressive educators, she studied to become a teacher, graduating in 1886. Her Catholic education led her to more conservative values than her family's, but after teaching for several years, she began to recognize the disparities between women and men teachers, as well as those of their students. By 1898, she was publicly calling for equal pay for equal work and campaigning for equal education for boys and girls. In 1902, Wiedermannov√° founded and became chair of the Moravian Teachers Union, whose focus was to professionalize teaching standards. The following year, she opened a Girls' Academy in Brno, hoping later to include secondary education there. As the Austro-Hungarian Empire provided little funding for girls' education, she held lectures to provide for the operating costs of the academy. Finally in 1908, she successfully established the first girls' secondary school in Moravia. That year, Wiedermannov√° founded and became the editor for ≈Ωensk√° revue (Women's Review), a magazine publishing articles on developments in the international women's movement. Also in 1908, she began an informal marriage with fellow teacher Vincenc Motyƒçka. As he was Catholic and unable to divorce his first wife, the two were not able to formalize their union, but she added his surname to her own. In 1909, she retired as a teacher to focus on activism. She became one of the most visible Czech feminists, presenting over a hundred lectures during her career. She founded numerous women's associations and in 1910 was instrumental in the creation of a regional umbrella organization, the Progressive Organization of Women in Moravia, actively committed to women's suffrage and the integration of women into all segments of public life. Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° was an active demonstrator at various rallies and participated in petition drives to secure the vote for women. She participated in international women's conferences and sought ties with feminists in other parts of the Czech lands. Through coordinated campaigns, activists tried to bring about electoral change, though their cooperation eventually broke down. From the onset of World War I, her activism shifted to focus on humanitarian aid for the poor and for soldiers' families. Her partner died in 1914 and she died the following year, shortly before Czech women secured the right to vote in 1918. She is remembered for her work to establish more extensive education for women and, more generally, to improve the status of women in Moravia. Early life Wiedermannov√°'s father Osvald V√≠drman (Wiedermann) Zde≈àka Maria and Hedvika Wiedermannov√°, twin daughters of Franti≈°ka (n√©e Zbo≈ôilov√°) and Osvald Wiedermann, were born on 17 April 1868 in N√°klo, in the Margraviate of Moravia, of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Her twin lived only until 26 July 1868. She had four other siblings: (1862‚Äì1935), who would also become active in the Moravian women's movement; Bo≈æena born on 16 April 1863; R≈Ø≈æena born on 2 July 1866; and a younger brother, Jaroslav, born on 12 February 1873. Her father often used the Czech version of his name, Osvald V√≠drman, and was a teacher and ethnographer of folk music and customs. Though she was raised in a progressive family, her Catholic training initially ingrained a more conservative philosophy for Wiedermannov√°. She was educated in the Catholic school system and in 1886 graduated from the teacher training institute run by the Ursuline Monastery in Olomouc. Career =Teaching= Wiedermannov√° began her teaching career in Fren≈°t√°t pod Radho≈°tƒõm after her graduation. She was then transferred to Hole≈°ov, and later Fry≈°t√°t, but left for Prague with her fianc√©. When her fianc√© left her, she made an attempt at suicide. Deciding to remain in Prague, she made the acquaintance in 1895 of a Catholic priest and academic, . Her family, who were evangelical and active in the anti-clerical movement, persuaded her to return to Moravia where, by the end of the year, she was teaching in Moravsk√© Budƒõjovice. She then taught in Ostrava, before settling in P≈ôerov by 1898. Wiedermannov√° felt trapped by the double standards of the era which allowed women to work, but paid them so little that they were often forced to marry. By that time, Wiedermannov√°'s religious conservatism had evaporated and at a teachers' conference held in 1898 in P≈ôerov, she made a public protest about women's pay. When the assembly ridiculed her statement that men and women should be paid the same for the same job, Wiedermannov√° explained she worked as many hours as her male colleagues, taught as many students, was just as dedicated to her profession, but was paid less. To work toward wage equity, in 1902 she founded the Jednota uƒçitelek moravsk√Ωch (Moravian Women Teachers Union), for which she served as chair. The teachers' union also pressed for improved academic training for teachers and industrial instructors as well as for more normal schools and other educational facilities for girls. Tom√°≈° Masaryk, Wiedermannov√°'s mentor Wiedermannov√° left P≈ôerov and was hired as the principal of Svƒõtl√° school in Velk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠, which led to her establishing relationships with some of the major figures of Czech educational reform, including , Josef Machar, Tom√°≈° Masaryk, and Josef √ölehla. She first met Masaryk in 1903 at a teachers' conference in Brno, where he was an invited lecturer. He became a mentor to her and tried to persuade her to serve as editor of the women's section of Na≈°e doba (Our Time), with a view to integrating the Moravian women's movement into politics. Though she did not take up the offer, he would later be instrumental in helping her found ≈Ωensk√° revue (Women's Review). That year, she founded and became principal of the Girls' Academy in Brno. Because only K2.5 million, out of a total educational budget of K43 million, were dedicated to women's education by the Austro-Hungarian authorities, Wiedermannov√° organized fund-raising events like hosting a lecture series. The lectures were very popular, raised K7,000 over a four-year period, and provided operating capital for the academy. Wiedermannov√°'s goal was to open a secondary education institution for girls, but she was unable to secure adequate funds to launch a gymnasium, or to persuade the authorities to issue diplomas to graduates. When that plan failed, she asked the government to allow girls to attend the boys' gymnasium, but the authorities were against co-educational instruction. They only allowed girls to attend classes as observers at three institutions and only for lectures on history, mathematics, and physics. She continued to press for adoption of a reform curriculum providing basic mandatory education, including certificates for all graduates who had met basic educational requirements. ≈Ωensk√° revue May 1910 As early as 1904, progressive women like Wiedermannov√° began agitating for the right to vote, petitioning the legislature for changes to the civil code, and protesting legislation prohibiting married women from teaching. Also that year, she attended the Second Congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance held in Berlin, where she presented a lecture on girls' secondary education in the Czech lands. In 1907, Wiedermannov√° gave a lecture in Prague, Emancipace ≈æeny od knƒõze (Emancipation of a Woman from a Priest), in which she criticized the Catholic Church for \\"emotionally and mentally abusing women\\" and argued that monastic education did not provide adequate instruction or prepare girls for the teaching profession. Although a women's gymnasium was allowed to open in Velk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠, Wiedermannov√° had still not achieved her goal for Brno. Her overwork led to an illness, which left her with a weak heart and impacted her hearing. By 1908, articles demanding equal rights regularly appeared in women's journals in Moravia and three women were proposed as candidates to the state legislative assembly. Wiedermannov√° founded and became the editor for ≈Ωensk√° revue, a magazine which provided information about the international women's movement, as well as on teachers and education. Approval was finally given for the Girl's Reform High School, but it was not allowed to use the term \\"gymnasium\\" until 1910. Also that year, she began living with another teacher, Vincenc Motyƒçka. As a Catholic, he was unable to remarry, as he had divorced his wife, so he and Wiedermannov√° were unable to formalize their relationship. The conservative community was scandalized by their living arrangement and pushed for her to resign from her post at the Girls' Academy. Undaunted, Wiedermannov√° left the church, modified her surname to include that of her partner, and helped him raise his two children. After a year of juggling teaching and editing, she decided to retire and applied for her pension, so she could focus on editing the magazine. =Women's rights activism= Feminists at the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance hosted in Budapest, 1913 (Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° is standing second from the left) In 1909, Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° founded the Sdru≈æen√≠ pokrokov√Ωch ≈æen (Association of Progressive Women) in Olomouc. Her ultimate goal was to establish independent regional associations clustered under an umbrella organization, which would coordinate the common goals and ideology of the Moravian women's movement. The association established committees dedicated to women's education, legal parity, socio-political and economic equality, as well as morality and hygiene sections. The members monitored laws and held lectures to educate women on the issues and their obligations as citizens. Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° became a noted lecturer on women's issues, giving over a hundred presentations in Brno throughout the course of her career. Organizing courses to train mothers, establishing shelters for abandoned or illegitimate children, and pressing for legal reforms ‚Äî like obligatory civil marriage, the possibility of divorce or separation, and regulations to control working conditions ‚Äî all became areas members worked on to improve the socio-economic status of women. In 1910, Wiedermannov√°- Motyƒçkov√° attended the founding meeting of the Zemsk√° organizace pokrokov√Ωch ≈æen moravsk√Ωch (Provincial Organization of Progressive Moravian Women) in Brno. Helping to write the Articles of Association, she tried to temper the political activism of the organization, since federal law prohibited women from creating political associations. Nonetheless, the application for the organization was rejected by the authorities on 20 April 1910. Nine days later, the women organized the Pokrokov√° organizace ≈æen na Moravƒõ (Progressive Organization of Women in Moravia), proposing a broader focus of women's empowerment, through improved education, economic independence, and legal change to grant women full citizenship. was elected as chair and Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° served as the executive. By the end of that year, other regional women's organizations had been formed and the journal Pr√°vo ≈æeny (Rights of Women) had been established as the official press organ of the Progressive Organization of Women in Moravia. The magazine was founded by Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° and her partner Motyƒçka, to encourage popular support for women's suffrage and equality. It published speeches from rallies and demonstrations throughout the region in a consolidated format, raising awareness of the issues confronting women. Establishing ties with the , which agreed to place women's issues on its platform, Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° and the Moravian Progressive Organization became part of the larger cooperation of women in the Czech lands. This was difficult, as the Moravian women's movement had stronger ties to Austrian feminists, had been established later than other Czech groups, and was seriously hampered by the influence of the Catholic Church. Along with Franti≈°ka Plam√≠nkov√° and , both teachers from Bohemia, she became one of the most vocal representatives of the Czech woman's movement. Plam√≠nkov√° was invited to chair the Committee on Electoral Rights of Moravian Women and Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° drafted the political program, calling for full civil equality with men, abolishment of the law forbidding women's political associations, opening professions to women, and women's suffrage. By 1911, women had won the right to organize politically and began petitioning the Bohemian Diet for enfranchisement. Wiedermannov√°'s sister, Ludmila Koneƒçn√° in 1932 Throughout 1911, rallies and demonstrations were held and in June a women's conference was held in Olomouc. The conference included elections for organizing an executive committee for the Zemsk√° pokrokov√° organizace ≈æen na Moravƒõ (Regional Progressive Women's Organization in Moravia). Wiedermannov√°- Motyƒçkov√°'s sister, Ludmila Koneƒçn√°, was elected as chair and she was selected as the organization's secretary. The Olomouc conference was the first significant gathering of women in the Czech lands and was used as a rallying meeting to urge that petitions be drafted by all Czech women's groups and simultaneously delivered to the Diet in Vienna. Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° and Plam√≠nkov√° presented speeches on democracy and civil equality while Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° and V√°≈°ov√° were chosen as delegates to bring the Moravian petitions to Austria. Suffering from illness, Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° was unable to travel in July, so her sister Ludmila led the Moravian delegation. Though legislators promised to give the petitions consideration, they adjourned without reforming the election laws. The year 1912 was marked by more rallies and demonstrations. With the election of Bo≈æena Vikov√°- Kunƒõtick√° to the Diet and her subsequent rejection by the governor, Czech nationalists, who saw the invalidation of the election as an overreach of Austria's central authority, began supporting women's suffrage. Bolstered by the surge in public support, activists began planning a renewed push for electoral reform in 1913. They began hosting lectures to familiarize women with the various political parties. These courses had an average of 150 people in attendance and concluded with Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° giving an overview of the activities of the Regional Progressive Women's Organization in Moravia. When the elections in 1913 for the Moravian Provincial Assembly were held, 400 women teachers, who were not on the electoral lists, filed protests with the Municipal Council of Brno. The women argued that in accordance with the judgment of the Administrative Court of 21 October 1908, teachers were allowed to vote and excluding female teachers contravened the law. The Council's answer was that the allowance for teachers to vote applied only for municipal elections. Though teachers continued to protest, the Council's interpretation was upheld in a decision by the Supreme Imperial Court that fall. In June, Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° and other Moravian feminists attended a conference in Prague organized by Plam√≠nkov√° and Bohemian activists. She was also sent as a delegate to the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance hosted in Budapest where she made a presentation on the struggle for suffrage in Moravia. By the end of the year, fractures in the relationship with Bohemian feminists occurred when Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√°'s proposal for centralizing efforts on electoral rights was rejected by Plam√≠nkov√° because the electoral rules varied between Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. A full cessation of cooperation occurred by the end of the year, as neither of them wanted to cede power and both feared that either Moravian or Czech perspectives would dominate their strategies. A series of attacks in ≈Ωensk√Ω obzor (Women's Horizon) followed, where both Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° and Plam√≠nkov√° accused each other of being unable to set aside their personal ambitions for the good of the movement. In 1914, the Regional Progressive Organization of Women in Moravia submitted a petition to the Moravian Provincial Assembly for universal suffrage, but the outbreak of World War I interrupted the reform and curtailed women's political activities until the end of the war. During the war, Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° turned her focus to charitable activities. Along with other members of the Regional Progressive Organization of Women in Moravia, she organized collections to raise money for the poor and the families of soldiers. Aware that women with children needed to work while their husbands were away fighting, she also called for the establishment of shelters to care for their children. Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° published articles in ≈Ωensk√° revue outlining where help was needed and continued to produce articles to inform women about health issues, economic challenges, and cultural events. In 1914, Vincenc Motyƒçka died, which left Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° in a precarious financial situation and worried for his children. Trying to keep ≈Ωensk√© revue open exhausted her and hastened her early death. Death and legacy Memorial plaque honoring Wiedermannov√°- Motyƒçkov√° at the Girls' Real Gymnasium on Mendel Square in Brno, 1925 Wiedermannov√°-Motyƒçkov√° died on 16 October 1915 in Brno after a heart attack, and was buried in the city's Central Cemetery. Her tombstone was designed by . Following their deaths, her sister Ludmila Koneƒçn√° and her brother-in-law Alois Koneƒçn√Ω were buried with her. She is remembered for her work to establish the first girls' gymnasium in Moravia, and for having significantly influenced the political activism of Moravian women in her era, using progressive ideas to overcome religious conservatism. Though she did not live to see it, Czech women gained the right to vote in 1918. ≈Ωensk√° revue was continued until 1920 with funding and editing provided by her sisters Ludmila and Bo≈æena, Anna Tollnerov√°, and . In 1925, a plaque honoring Wiedermannov√°- Motyƒçkov√°'s initiative to press for secondary education for women was unveiled at the Girls' Real Gymnasium on in Brno.

It was a monthly television special that aired live from Madison Square Garden on the MSG Network from August 7, 1976 to March 16, 1997. The program featured live wrestling matches and interviews with WWF wrestlers. Updates of current feuds and several major title changes also took place on the show. History World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) began airing their monthly television special WWWF on MSG Network on August 7, 1976 after several years of airing their monthly Madison Square Garden shows on HBO. Several notable title changes took place on the show including Bob Backlund winning his first WWWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Superstar Billy Graham on February 20, 1978. The show was renamed WWF on MSG Network after the promotion changed its name to \\"World Wrestling Federation\\" in March 1979. The show was an important event and equivalent to today's pay- per-view events. Many important matches and storyline developments took place on the show, for example, Hulk Hogan's rise to stardom began on the show when he defeated The Iron Sheik to capture his first WWF Championship on January 23, 1984. With the rise of Hogan's popularity and WWF's national expansion, the show lost its significance following the first pay-per-view event WrestleMania in 1985. With the addition of more pay-per-view events and the introduction of Saturday Night's Main Event as a nationally televised monthly special, the WWF on MSG Network discontinued after 1992. WWF aired one final event on the MSG Network on March 16, 1997. =Title changes= WWF on MSG Network had many notable title changes. *Bob Backlund defeated Superstar Billy Graham to win the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship on February 20, 1978 *Bob Backlund defeated Bobby Duncum in a Texas Deathmatch to win the vacant WWF Championship on December 17, 1979 **Backlund had lost the title to Antonio Inoki on November 30 in Japan, but after a controversial rematch on December 6 in Japan, the title was vacated. Neither match was acknowledged on US television. The match against Duncum was referred to on US television as a title defense, even though Backlund was not introduced as champion, nor did he wear the belt during his entrance. *Ken Patera defeated Pat Patterson to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship on April 21, 1980 *Pedro Morales defeated Don Muraco to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship on November 23, 1981 *Bob Backlund defeated Greg Valentine to win the vacant WWF Championship on November 23, 1981 **The title was vacated on October 19 when Backlund had successfully defended the title against Valentine but the dazed referee awarded the title to Valentine. The title controversy was not recognized outside New York City and WWF continued to recognize Backlund as champion outside New York City.

The estate has acquired by Carl Adolph von Plessen in 1725 and had been owned by the von Plessen family since then. The main building from the second half of the 16th century and two half-timbered buildings from the seclnd half of the 18th century were listed oj the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The estate covers covers 1,050 hectares. History The first known owner of Salt√∏ was Jacob Fleb. After his death in 1351, his children sold it to Nicolaus af Jura. In 1353, Nicolaus af Jura's son sold the estate to their relative Herman af Jura. In 1377, Salt√∏ was acquired by Count Ernst af Gleichen. In 1386, he sold Salt√∏ to Margaret I. In 1393, she granted to the Diocese of Toskilde. After the Reformation, in 1536, it was conficated by the crown along with all other church property. It was then administrated as a royal fief. In 1646, Christian IV ceded it to his son by Kirsten Munk, Valdemar Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, in exchange for other property. Shortly thereafter, possibly already the same year, he sold it to his brother-in-law, Corfitz Ulfeldt, who then served as Steward of the Realm. After Ulfeldt's fall from power, in 1651, Salt√∏ was confiscated by the Vrown along with his other holdings. In 1858, he entered Swedish service and the Swedish king gave him his Danish estates back. In 1661, he lost his Danish estates again when he sought amnesty but was imprisoned in Gammerhus on Bornholm. After living for a time in concealment at Amsterdam, Ulfeldt moved to Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. In 1657, King Charles X of Sweden invaded Denmark. In July 1657, Ulfeldt responded to the King's invitation to enter his service. Sweden was Denmark's deadliest foe. Ulfeldt's purpose was twofold: humiliate his monarch and secure a personal fortune. He persuaded the commandant of Nakskov (a strategically crucial fortress) to surrender to Charles X, and did his best to convince his countrymen that resistance was useless. He even loaned the Swedish king a fortune to finance the war with money that, it is believed, was embezzled from the Danish state. Finally, as one of the Swedish negotiators at the Treaty of Taastrup, he was instrumental in assuring the humiliation of his native land. Ulfeldt's treason was rewarded by Charles X of Sweden with ennoblement as the Count of S√∂lvesborg in Blekinge and he was in the same time given his Danish holdings back. He later returned to Copenhagen to try to make his peace with his lawful sovereign, who promptly imprisoned him and his wife. In the summer of 1660 they were conveyed to Hammershus in Bornholm, as prisoners of state. In 1661, he gave up his Danish estates in exchange for his release. In 1668, Salt√∏ was sold to Otto Pogwisch. He held several high offices but was heavily indebted. In 1681, he had to sell Salt√∏ to Knud Thott. He was already to owner of Gavn√∏ and Knudstrup. In 1693, he sold Salt√∏ to Matthias Numsen. He had a military background and had served in the Scanian War. He was married to one of Ole Worm's daughters. In 1701 he also purchased Fuglebjerggaard. Carl Adolf von Plessen In 1725, Salt√∏ was acquired by Carl Adolf von Plessen. Plessen had close ties to Frederik IV's brother, Prince Carl, and was a member of the government (Gehejmekonseillet) from 1730. He was one of the largest landowners in the country. His other estates included F√∏rslevgaard, Harrestedg√•rd, Gunderslevholm, Kastrupg√•rd, Fuglebjerggaard, Fodbygaard and Dronningelund. He was known for his many initiatives to improve the living conditions for the peasants on his estates, for instance by establishing numerous schools. Having no children, he placed his estates in a foundation, De plessiske fideikommisgodser. After his death in 1758, De plessiske fideikommisgodser was divided in two. One of them passed to his nephew Frederik Christian von Plessen and the other went to the three sons of his brother Mogens Scheel von Plessen. Frederik Christian von Plessen, who had no children, in 1763, ceded his estates to the four grand-nephews of the other line. In 1771, Salt√∏ passed to Christian Ludvig Scheel von Plessen. He was already the owner of Fusing√∏ and Lindholm and Sels√∏. The estate has later passed through the Scheel-Plessen line of the Plessen family. Architecture The main building is a two-storey, two, winged complex. The eastern part of the north wing dates from the late Middles Afes. The east wing and the western part of the north wing date from the second half of the 16th century. The main building and two half-timbered buildings from the second half of the 18th century were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. Today The current owner of Salt√∏ is Carl- Alexander M. H., Count Plessen. The estate covers 1,050 hectares of land. Cultural references Salt√∏ was used as a location in the 1961 film Landsbyl√¶gen.

It is known to be a close relative to other dermatophytes such as Trichophyton and Epidermophyton. The fungus is common within soil environments and grows well on keratinized material, such as hair, nails and dead skin. It is recognized as an opportunistic fungal pathogen capable of causing cutaneous mycoses in humans and animals. Originally, the fungus was thought to be Microsporum gypseum until enhanced genetic examination separated the two as distinct species in 1963.  History and taxonomy  Microsporum fulvum was first documented in 1909 as Microsporum gypseum by Weitzman et al. (Argentina Medical Society). The fungus was thought to be the imperfect state of the anamorphic, asexually reproducing, M. gypseum. However, in Stockdale (1963) M. fulvum was considered and described as its own species, Nannizzia fulva, the perfect state of the fungus. In the present, M. fulvum is still referred to as part of the Microsporum gypseum complex. This complex includes the three distinct species: Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum fulvum and Microsporum incurvatum. Each of these fungi possess a high degree of morphological similarity but do have significant genetic differences accounting for the speciation.  Growth  Microsporum fulvum will grow well on soil in a wide- variety of climate conditions and is found in world-wide distribution. The fungus tends to colonize keratin-rich environments and will grow rapidly in culture or in nature at diverse temperatures. M. fulvum commonly occupies materials such as dead skin cells and fragmented hair filaments. In culture, growth will occur within 4‚Äì5 days and forms floccose, wooly colonies. The clustered cells appear granular with a sandy-brown tinge where most compact and a less dense, whiter periphery. = Morphology = M. fulvum looks morphologically similar to Microsporum gypseum. The fungus propagates sexually reproductive asci that are 5-7 microns large with up to 8 spores, which are densely packed with ascospores. Asexual macroconidia are also formed and appear in large clusters (up to 8 microns in diameter) with hyphae branches. The macroconidia are fusoid-shaped with tapered ends and have very thin walls. Microconidia are drop-shaped and are observed with sparse, irregular hyphae. When grown on soil combined with horse hair, closed fruiting bodies called cleistothecia form. = Reproduction = Microsporum fulvum is classified as a teleomorphic species as it sexually reproduces. This sexual state has been referred to as Arthroderma fulvum. Two mating types have been distinguished for the sexual reproduction of the fungus and are characterized with (+) and (-). The (+) mating type synthesizes the elastase enzyme, where as the (-) mating type is unable to produce the elastase. Experiments involving the mating types suggest that the (+) mating type has higher virulence and causes more cases of infection. However, both strains demonstrate a positive result for their ability to hydrolyze the urea molecule, indicating the presence of the urease enzyme. A conducted study showed that a majority of tested isolates (>50%) of M. fulvum tested positive for urea hydrolysis within 0‚Äì7 days, and almost all isolates tested positive within 10‚Äì12 days, suggesting rapid growth of the organism.  Habitat and ecology  Like many other dermatophytes, M. fulvum is a soil-loving, geophilic organism. The species is commonly found invading obsolete hair fibres and skin molecules which are made of keratin proteins. It can be found growing on the keratinized material of many different mammalian species including humans, horses, rodents, dogs, etc. without perceived preference. However, a higher incidence of colonization of M. fulvum has been documented on the epidermis of hedgehogs without causing any serious skin lesions, suggesting a commensal relationship between the organisms. Isolates of the fungus have been found in skin and lung samples of healthy rodents without indication of impairment. As well, other Microsporum species have arthrospores that are known to remain on human scalp hairs for months without causing skin lesions. Due to the similar behavioural description of species in the Microsporum genus, it is believed that penetration of the mucous membrane is necessary for the fungus to become infectious to the host, otherwise the fungal organism can coexist without harm. Geographically, Microporum fulvum has been found in diverse climate regions world-wide. The distribution of the fungus seems to be very broad and indiscriminate to temperature fluctuations. Isolates have been documented in Germany, Spain, France, Gabon, Iran and many more geographically distinct areas. The fungus is commonly isolated in Canadian soils, however few infections have been reported. After a 20-year-old man in Iran was diagnosed with a M. fulvum fungal infection, a study was conducted on Iranian soil cultures from regions of varying temperatures. Experiments concluded that M. fulvum is colonized in the soils of a wide variety of environmental regions.  Detection  A mechanism termed baiting can be used to attract Microsporum fulvum to specific soil samples. The method involves preparing the desired soil with keratinized molecules (hair fragments, nail clippings, etc.) and waiting for colonization of fungus onto the material. Once fungal collections populate the sample, morphological examination can be conducted and completed. Morphological analysis is used to distinguish Microsporum species from other keratin-loving dermatophytes. To accurately decipher Microsporum gypseum and Microsporum fulvum from one another, many researchers use genetic analysis procedures. PCR amplification and genetic testing can be used to uncover information about the mitochondrial DNA, which differs between the two species. In clinical reports, researchers have used methods referred to as Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) Sequencing and Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (Maldi-TOF) Mass Spectrometry to differentiate the species of the Microsporum gypseum complex.  Disease  = Pathogenicity = Microsporum fulvum causes infection in humans, similar to the ringworm infection caused by Microsporum gypseum that can lead to disease progression. M. fulvum has been reported in cases of dermatophytosis, cutaneous mycoses on any keratinized tissue (dead skin). Tinea corporis refers to the generic ringworm infection that can occur on any area of the body. Tinea pedis is commonly referred to as Athlete's Foot and involves Microsporum fungi infecting the feet. Tinea capitis refers to Microsporum fungi infection of the scalp. Each of these can be caused by Microsporum fulvum, as well as other fungi, and elicit a similar immune response leading to dry patches, rashes, redness, edema, etc. in a localized area. Research shows that most infections from M. fulvum will have a duration of approximately one month and regress on their own, with the exception of more severe cases that require treatment. These mycoses are restricted to keratinized tissue and remain localized as non-systemic infections. The causative agent of disease are fungal keratinases, which degrade dead material and break down tissue. However, defense mechanisms are present within mammalian blood serum that inhibit these molecules and do not allow the fungus to travel throughout the body in the circulatory system. If the fungus gains access to mucosal membranes, it begins to release the elastase enzyme as well, which is responsible for causing an inflammatory response in the host. = Transmission = Initial infections with Microsporum fulvum are most likely from indirect sources where the fungus inhabited soil that came into contact with the mucous membrane of an animal. New infections can arise through direct or indirect contact of animals and humans who have been introduced to another contaminated source. Often tranmission involves the shared use of clothing (shoes- tinea pedis, hats- capitis, etc.). Incidence of infection cases increase in winter months with cold climates due to continued use of closed-toed footwear which provide a good environment for fungal growth. Symptoms of infection are also exacerbated and more severe in these conditions. Initial infections are common in those with high contact to soil and plant material, such as gardeners. Secondary contamination of M. fulvum often occurs in bursts with multiple infections. In 1949, there were 8 cases of microsporosis caused by M. fulvum that were all in children under the age of 10 who lived in the same neighbourhood of Indiana. Thus, the fungus can spread through contact transmission. = Treatment and prevention = Due to the biological properties and transmission methods of M. fulvum, proper hygienic practices assist with prevention of infection, especially regarding tinea pedis (infection of the feet). Health officials recommend the avoidance of contaminated flooring, such as locker rooms where fungi grow rapidly. In past reports, treatment methods for Microsporum gypseum infections have been effective for M. fulvum infections. Anti-fungal drugs may be prescribed. As few infections have been confirmed to be caused by M. fulvum, little data has become available on treatment options. However, one confirmed infection in an Iranian man had been treated with oral terbinafine (antifungal drug) and the infection cleared.  Biotechnology applications  Keratinase is an enzyme that functions to break down and degrade keratin molecules. Microsporum fulvum has the ability to synthesize keratinase and utilize the enzyme to inhabit and exploit the environment in which it resides. Poultry industries have become interested in organisms which intrinsically produce keratinase for the reasoning that chicken feathers, which have high levels of dense keratin, are tough to break down and utilize. Fungal keratinase could be cultivated to break down chicken feathers into smaller products which could be converted into other material, such as animal feed.

The fungus is a pathogen, mainly causing plant and animal infections, and rarely causing human infections. C. geniculata is characterized by its curved conidia, which has a dark brown centre and pale tapered tips, and produces anti-fungal compounds called Curvularides A-E. History and taxonomy The fungus was discovered by American botanist Samuel Mills Tracy and mycologist Franklin Sumner Earle in Starkville, Mississippi 1894 on Love grass (Eragrostis rachitricha) grown from imported seeds. They classified the fungus as Helminthosporium geniculatum; however, the Heliminthosporium species later got segregated into four different genera, one being the genus Curvularia. In 1923, Karel Bernard Boedijn, a Dutch botanist and mycologist, reclassified the fungus as Curvularia geniculata which is the asexual form (anamorph) of the fungus. Associated with C. geniculata is the sexual form (teleomorph), classified first as Cochliobolus geniculatus in 1964 and later reclassified to Pseudocochliobolus geniculatus in 1978 by Richard Robert Nelson. Morphology C. geniculata colonies grown on Oxford agar can grow rapidly to 3-5 cm in diameter, with a dark brown and hairy appearance. The fungus produces conidiophores up to 600 Œºm long, becoming lighter near the tip, and are septate, meaning the structure is subdivided by walls called septa. The conidiophores will produce 4-septate conidia (18-37 x 8-14 Œºm), consisting of a curved, broad central section that is dark brown and paler tapered ends. C. geniculata can be mistaken for Curvularia lunata because the latter is more commonly found. These two can be distinguished because C. lunata produces 3-septate conidia. Growth and physiology The optimal growth temperature for C. geniculata is . As a thermotolerant, the fungus can grow up to , but grows at a slower rate. The culture age (20-, 40-, and 60-day-old) affect the germination rate, germ tube growth and branching in different temperature conditions. Conidia germination was found to increase as temperature increased to 15¬∞C in all cultures. However, as the temperature reached or passed over 25¬∞C, germination declined in 40- and 60-day-old cultures, but not in 20-day-old cultures. In all the cultures, germ tube growth and branching increased as the temperature increased to 25¬∞C, but decreased above 25¬∞C. Habitat and ecology C. geniculata is frequently reported to be found in soil and plants, particularly in warmer areas. The fungus was found to be associated with many plant species within the families Amaranthaceae, Apiaceae, Araceae, Asteraceae, Balsaminaceae, Basellaceae, Brassicaceae, Convolvulaceae, Fabaceae, Gesneriaceae, Marantaceae, Oleaceae, Papaveraceae, Poaceae, Solanacae, Vitaceae and Zingiberaceae. The fungus has been commonly found in Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore and Thailand), Africa (Nigeria, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Uganda), Europe (USSR and Italy), North America (Bahamas, Canada, Central America, Cuba, Jamaica, Tobago, Trinidad and the USA), Oceania (Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands) and South America (Brazil, Peru and Venezuela). Pathogenicity C. geniculata is most often associated with a wide range of plant species, especially in tropical countries, because it has little host specificity. Not only is this fungus commonly pathogenic to plants, but it is also frequently found in animals and occasionally found in humans. Members of the Curvularia species produce metabolites and toxins, some with anti-fungal properties. C. geniculata produces anti-fungal compounds, Curvularides A-E, which function in cyclic peptide regulation and cell wall degradation. Curvularide B was found to use its anti-fungal properties on Candida albicans, a fungus often associated with HIV patients. =Plant infections= C. geniculata, a common plant pathogen, colonizes the roots of many plant species. For instance, Witchweed is a plant host of C. geniculata which causes huge crop losses because it parasitizes corn, grain, and many other plant species. Upon germination, the fungus is able to cause infection by penetrating the plant with its infectious pegs called appressorium, allowing the hyphae to grow in and between the host cells, resulting in cell death and leafspots. =Animal infections= C. geniculata is a frequent animal pathogen that has been found to cause many animal diseases such as sinus infections in cattle, swelling of the skin (subcutaneous tumefactions) of dogs and horses, bone infections (osteomyelitis) in dogs, and central nervous infections in birds. The fungus has been identified as the common causal agent of mycetomata, a chronic fungal infection, which gives rise to pigmented nodules on the body of horses upon traumatic injury. Also, C. geniculata has been reported to cause bovine mycotic abortion in cattle, likely by inhalation or ingestion of the conidia by pregnant cows. =Human infections= C. geniculata rarely contributes to human disease and has been reported in a few cases of keratitis, inflammatory disease often of the feet (mycetomas), (endocarditis) and peritonitis. The fungus enters into the human body via injury to the eye, colonization of the sinus, penetration of the skin or inhalation. Being exposed for a long period of time and contact with soil are the biggest risk factors of getting infected by C. geniculata. Potential treatments The fungus was found to be susceptible to Ketoconazole and itraconazole anti-fungal drugs in vitro. Patients with C. geniculata-induced peritonitis fully recovered upon treatment with anti-fungal medications, amphotericin B and itraconazole. Biotechnology applications Due to industrial activities, mercury is present in the soil which is very toxic and is a possible health hazard to humans and animals. C. geniculata can potentially be used as a method for mercury bioremediation because of its resistant properties to mercury and ability to colonize on plant roots. By colonizing host roots, mercury extracted from the soil can accumulate in the host, reducing the mercury levels in the soil. The fungus was able to remove more than 97% of mercury in vitro.

No health issues caused by this fungus in human and animals have been reported although it is causative of brown rot. This fungus grows rapidly on malt extract agar (MEA), forming white mats with a faint sweet odour. It is commonly called \\"chain chlamydospore fungus\\" because bulbils are formed by chains of its cells that resemble chlamydospores. The basidia of this fungus are urniform and usually possess 6-8 sterigmata, and the spores are smooth and slightly curved. History and taxonomy Sistotrema brinkmannii possessed several synonyms in the early twentieth century including Corticium coronilla and Corticium octosporum, named by v. H√∂hnel & Litschauer and Schroeter ex v. Hohnel & Litschauer in 1906 respectively, and (Bres.) J. Erikss. named it Sistotrema brinkmannii in 1948. This fungus has been known as a cotton root rot pathogen, and it was thought to be an outdoor airborne fungus as there had been no reports suggesting its presence in indoor air. However, studies in Scotland found that 56% of indoor air samples from 51% of homes contained Sistotrema brinkmannii, indicating that wood rot observed in houses can be caused by this fungus. The basidia of Sistotrema brinkmannii usually range 10-20 √ó 5-8 Œºm and spores are 4-5 √ó 2-2.5 Œºm in size. This fungus was believed to be one of the different life stages of Phymatotrichum omnivorum. However, they are distinguished from each other based on the feature of their hyphae; hyphae of Sistotrema brinkmannii have dolipore septum while Phymatotrichum omnivorum possesses the simple type. Phylogenetic analyses sequencing genes such as mtSSU and RPB2 can strongly support the monophyly of this fungus, sorting it into the same monophyletic group as Clavulina-Membranomyces. Growth and morphology In 1994, Adan found that about 30% of the fungi floating in the air is Sistotrema brinkmannii in England, and the proportion increases to near 60% in winter. On the other hand, the presence of this fungus in the air significantly decreases in summer and autumn. His study indicates that Sistotrema brinkmannii is not a dominant fungus in the air throughout the year, compared to other airborne fungi such as Penicillium, Cladosporium, and mycelia sterilia. The membrane of this fungus is white and has waxy and soft texture when it is fresh. When it gets dry, it becomes pale cream and its texture gets ashy and brittle. It is oxidase negative and the hyphae containing numerous clamps are oil-rich, contributing to its coarse granular appearance. The mycelium of this fungus can cultivate on trama of Trametes hirsuta fruit bodies, as well as on wood-inhabiting basidiomycetes, with the help of a technique called \\"moisture gradient technique\\". Physiology Sistotrema brinkmannii produces Œ≤-1,3/1,4-glucanase which has a great catalytic efficiency towards a variety of specific substrates. For instance, it converts Avicel containing microcrystalline cellulose to glucose at pH 4.0 and 65¬∞C. It also forms white thin mycelial mats by microfiltration to protect itself from chemicals and microorganisms in soil and water. It decays window joinery in the house although it does not produce many spores, indicating that it is more widespread in indoor air compared to other fungi, such as Serpula lacrymans, which are associated with indoor wood decay. Habitat and reproduction Both outdoor and indoor airs may contain Sistotrema brinkmannii. It was found that this fungus can contaminate washing machines in houses, but it is not a causative agent of human diseases or formation of malodour. The number of spores in dwellings increases as a result of surface disturbance such as vacuum cleaning of floors. This fungus may contaminate biofilms called endobronchial stents as well, which are used as an antibiotic treatment for airway complications such as lung transplantation. However, this contamination does not cause any serious issues in human health while some other fungi, including Scedosporium, which possibly contaminate the biofilms are known to be opportunistic pathogens in human. This fungus can reproduce sexually by both breeding and self-breeding which systems are called heterothallism and homothallism, respectively. There are three different incompatibility groups identified based on the reproductive mechanisms: bipolar heterothallic forms, tetrapolar heterothallic forms, and homothallic forms. These reproductive forms are dependent on its genetics. It was believed that homothallic forms are intersterile while both bipolar and tetrapolar heterothallic forms are capable of mating. In 1969, Lemke recognized that bipolar heterothallic forms and tetrapolar heterothallic forms also have intersterility as well as homothallic forms. In the study, he defines intersterility as the inability to form a prototrophic heterokaryon through nutritional forcing. The study indicates that all groups are in fact intersterile with each other, meaning that the mating must be carried out within the same group for successful sexual reproduction. Among the three groups, homothallic and bipolar forms groups may occasionally be hybridized due to nutritional forces.

He studied at the University of New South Wales where he received three research doctorates: PhD, MD, and DSc. Gandevia's current research focuses primarily on the relationship between the human brain and movement. His work contributes to various sub-fields within medicine particularly focusing on pathological mechanisms, such as neurology, cardiorespiratory medicine and rehabilitation. In addition, he worked with many editorial boards such as the Journal of Physiology. Gandevia had supervised and trained several doctoral students. Gandevia also writes about research ethics and quality of experimental procedures in order to facilitate the development of concepts about ethics in human experimental studies. In 1998, Gandevia was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, and the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Science in 2016.  Early life  Gandevia is originally from Melbourne, Australia. Both his parents were physicians. During the Korean War, Gandevia's father was a regimental medical officer with an Australian infantry battalion. Gandevia currently resides in Australia with his wife Julie. Gandevia and his wife are known for their interest of bonsai trees during their leisure time. Gandevia is also an artist who carves sculptures from limestone.  Education  Simon Gandevia completed a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery at the University of South New Wales. Gandevia went on to complete an undergraduate in physiology. After completing this degree, Gandevia went on to complete a Doctor of Medicine at the Prince Henry Hospital under David Burke's supervision. Ian McCloskey supervised Gandevia through his PhD on human movement control and proprioception at the University of South New Wales. He also holds a Doctor of Science degree from the University of South New Wales.  Career history  Gandevia is a clinical neurophysiologist who focuses his research and clinical work primarily on patients with spinal cord injury and neuromuscular disorders. Gandevia, together with three other scientists, founded Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), previously known as the Prince Wales Medical Research Institute. Gandevia's research falls into the following four categories: neural mechanisms of proprioception, neural control of muscle performance (focusing on muscle fatigue), control of human breathing muscles, and passive properties of muscles. Through his research, he investigated the neuropathology: stroke, spinal cord injury, prior‚Äîpolio, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive apnoea. Currently, his focus is on programs dealing with pathophysiology and motor impairments. Gandevia is the only researcher to have published more than 100 papers in the Journal of Physiology in the year of 2011. Gandevia acts as the Deputy Director for the Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute and the Co-Director of the Spinal Injuries Research Centre at the institute. In addition to working as a Professor at the University of South New Wales, he also is an Honorary Professor of Physiotherapy at the University of Queensland and the University of Sydney. Gandevia also occupies a position within the National Health and Medical Research Council as a Senior Principal Research Fellow. Previously, Gandevia has worked at international institutes such as Yale University, McMaster University, California Institute of Technology, the Department of Neurology at the Institute of Psychiatry, and the Institute of Neurology, London. He has also occupied editorial board positions in several journals such as the Journal of Applied Physiology and Respiration Physiology, Acta Physiologica Scandinavica and the Journal of Physiology. = Awards = Gandevia has been awarded the Paxinos-Watson prize of the Australian Neuroscience Society, the Edgeworth David Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales and the Centenary Medal of Australia.  Research  = Motor impairment = At NeuRA, Simon Gandevia studies the mechanisms underlying everyday motor activities such as balancing and walking. Through randomized control trials, he is investigating new treatment options to reduce the severity of motor impairment and understand the underlying physiology of motor disorders. Gandevia founded the Motor Impairment Program at Neuroscience Research Australia, an initiative designed to research and treat a range of motor impairments. He serves as the Project Coordinator for the programme, which is funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. The goal of this initiative is to address gaps in existing knowledge about the pathways leading to motor impairment. Gandevia and his team have designed the program to focus mainly on three areas: muscle contraction, fatigue, and impaired balance. With his team, Gandevia has conducted the largest study examining physiological factors contributing to falls in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He has also compiled the first description of the three- dimensional changes that occur when muscles contract. Since its inception in 2014, the project has published over 150 manuscripts in journals including The Lancet, JAMA and Journal of Physiology. Gandevia has also developed the Upper Limb Physiological Profile Assessment, a screening tool used to identify motor impairments. = Breathing = Gandevia also researches breathlessness. Gandevia and his colleagues completed an experiment examining the underlying causes of breathlessness. The experiment involved putting participants in a state of paralysis by restricting the regular rate of breathing, causing increased carbon dioxide levels in blood. This experiment confirmed the role of brain receptors in the detection of increased levels of carbon dioxide. Gandevia conducted research to understand the neurophysiological control of breathing muscles, especially in cases of spinal injury, sleep apnea and chronic obstructive lung disease. Research in this area contributes to the treatment of respiratory impairments in the elderly. He has contributed to the development of new imaging methods using techniques such as ultrasounds and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Gandevia and fellow researchers at NeurRA have proposed a novel therapy for the complication of coughing in stroke patients, which involved the electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles to correct muscular behaviour. = Publications = Simon Gandevia has authored over 390 scientific papers and has submitted numerous conference abstracts. In 2002, he co-wrote a book titled Sensorimotor Control of Movement and Posture. It contains a compilation of research presented at a conference held at Cairns, Australia which examined the topic of sensorimotor control from a neural perspective. He has also written chapters in several books such as Proprioceptive Mechanisms and the Human Hand, The Neural Control of Human Inspiratory Muscles, Microneurography and Motor Disorders, Proprioception: Peripheral Inputs and Perceptual Interactions, Mechanical, Neural, and Perceptual Effects of Tendon Vibration, Properties of Human Peripheral Nerves: Implications for Studies of Human Motor Control and Mind Over Muscle: The Role of the CNS in Human Muscle Performance. = Replication crisis = In the article published in The Conversation titled, \\"We need to talk about the bad science being funded\\", Gandevia highlights the replication crisis in modern science. Citing a statistic from the magazine Nature which finds some, 90% of 1576 researchers surveyed believe in a replication crisis. Gandevia stresses that ‚Äòa high rate of [...] false discoveries‚Äô and ‚Äòlow statistical power to identify a genuine discovery‚Äô poses harms to published scientific literature. Gandevia mentions that many researches are ‚Äòfiddling [with] the primary hypothesis‚Äô after research has been completed or after statistically significant results have been found. He emphasizes the use of the ‚Äòpublish or perish‚Äô paradigm in science, which hinders academic progress by selectively publishing only favourable or statistically significant results. To counter this problem, he has advocated for the introduction of appropriate publication channels to make research data open-source. Gandevia also addresses the need to fund what he describes as correct research studies. He has expressed that the view that research funding should go to studies pursuing the discovery of novel information in favour of studies that have low statistical power and limited relevance to the scientific majors. He has attributed the use of substandard practices in research to the intense competition that exits in academia. Gandevia has suggested that 'Good science loses out when bad science gets the funding.' He has emphasized the need to impose a strict selection criteria that involves a careful assessment of the impact of potential studies by the government and other funding bodies for providing funds.  Personal life  = Sculpture = Despite being a medical scientist, Gandevia also attended classes at the Waverley Woollahra Art Centre and later at the Tom Bass Sculpture Studio School to learn sculpting where he engaged primarily in sandstone carving. Through a series of workshops with Paul Hopmeier, he was able to develop skills in carving limestone. He explored the incorporation of found objects in sculpturing by partaking in sessions delivered by Anita Larkin. Simon Gandevia makes weekly additions to his ‚Äò2 Minute Sculpture Series‚Äô with sculptures he creates from wood and stone amongst other media. In 2015, he organized his first art exhibition at the Clara St Gallery Erskineville where he sold some of his artwork with the resulting proceeds being donated to M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors without Borders). = Plants = In addition to engaging in sculpturing, Gandevia also devotes his time to the growth and care of bonsai trees. He has also been a significant contributor in the development of three gardens modelled in the Japanese style, one of which is located at Neuroscience Research Australia.

Gilbert was born in New York City, baptized in the Dutch Church in 1746, and married Catherine Cosine (or Cozyn) in 1767. He advertised a theft in the New York Gazette or Weekly Post-Boy, August 27, 1770, as follows: \\"Tuesday Night last some Villains broke into the shop of Mr. Gilbert, Silver-Smith in the Broad Way, and robbed the same of near two Hundred Pounds in Plate, &c.; Diligent Search has been made after the Thieves, but we Have not heard of any discovery being made.\\" He also advertised in the New York Gazette, 1770-1772, as a gold- and silversmith. From 1786-1804 he was listed in city directories as silversmith. During the American Revolution, Gilbert was an active patriot. In early 1775 he was named one of the 60 members of the city's \\"Committee of Sixty\\" and on May 1, 1775, was elected to its \\"Committee of One Hundred.\\" When the British invaded the city in August 1776, Gilbert and his family left, probably to eastern Connecticut or northern Westchester County, since a William Gilbert enrolled in Colonel John Lasher's regiment of New York militia. On November 26, 1783, the day after the British evacuated, General George Washington was presented with a document entitled \\"The Address of the Citizens of New York, who have returned from exile, in behalf of themselves and their suffering Brethren,\\" signed by Gilbert as William Gilbert Jr., his father, and others. Over time, Gilbert became a prominent and influential citizen. He was appointed from 1782-1788 as a city Alderman, and named a member of the Gold and Silversmiths' Society in 1786. He was Commissioner of Excise for several years, in 1786 oversaw renewal of tavern licenses. In other city offices, in 1794 he became an Associate Justice, in 1801 he was Assistant Alderman for the Seventh Ward and then in 1804 Alderman for the Eighth Ward. In 1803 he held the office of Prison Inspector. From 1788-1793 he served as one of the city's representatives in the State Assembly, and from 1809-1812 as a state senator. Gilbert's work is collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of the City of New York, and Clark Art Institute.

The term parasocial relationship was coined in 1956 by Donald Horton and R. Richard Wohl. They focused on the psychological attachment that was formed from viewing television personalities. Their work laid the foundation and popularized a wide range of research on parasocial phenomena. A parasocial interaction, an exposure that garners interest in a persona, becomes a parasocial relationship after repeated exposure to the media persona causes the media users to develop illusions of intimacy, friendship, and identification. Positive information learned about the media persona results in increased attraction and the relationship progresses. Parasocial relationships are enhanced due to trust and self-disclosure provided by the media persona. Media users are loyal and feel directly connected to the persona much like their close friends by observing and interpreting their appearance, gestures, voice, conversation, and conduct. Media personas have a significant amount of influence over media users, positive or negative, informing the way that they perceive certain topics or even their purchasing habits. Social media introduces additional opportunities for parasocial relationships to intensify because it provides more opportunities for intimate, reciprocal, and frequent interactions between the user and persona.  Background  The terms parasocial interactions and parasocial relationships were coined by anthropologist Donald Horton and sociologist R. Richard Wohl in 1956, laying the foundation for the topic within the field of communication studies. Originating from psychology, parasocial phenomena comes from a wide range of scientific backgrounds and methodological approaches. The study of parasocial relationships has increased with the growth of mass and social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, particularly by those investigating advertising effectiveness and journalism. Horton and Wohl have stated that television personas offer the media user a sense of intimacy and have influence over them by using their appearance and gesture in a way that is seen as being engaging, directly addressing the audience, and conversing with them in a friendly and personal manner. By viewing media personas regularly and feeling a sense of trust with the persona, parasocial relationships offer the media user a continuous relationship that intensifies.  Celebrity endorsements and advertising  Advertising and marketing can use media personas to increase brand awareness, keep media users engaged, and increase purchase intention by seeking out attractive media personas. If media personas show that they are interested in and engage in rewarding interactions with media users, then if the media user likes the persona they will reciprocate interactions and over time form a parasocial relationship with them. In this social media era, media users are able to have interactions with the media persona that are more intimate, open, reciprocal, and frequent. More media personas are using social media platforms for personal communication, revealing their personal lives and thoughts to consumers. The more frequent and conversational that the media persona self discloses via social media results in media users feeling high levels of intimacy, loyalty, and friendship. Media users know that the chances of receiving a direct message or getting a retweet from a celebrity are highly unlikely, but the possibility gives fans a sense of intimacy and adds authenticity to one-sided parasocial relationships with their favorite personas. Celebrity endorsements are so effective with purchase intention because parasocial relationships form such an influential bond of trust. The acceptance and trustworthiness that the media user feels towards the media persona is carried over into the brand that is being promoted. Media users feel that they understand media personas and appreciate their values and motives. This accumulation of time and knowledge acquired of the media persona translates into feelings of loyalty, which can then influence their attitudes, voting decisions, prejudices, change their ideas about reality, willingness to donate, and purchasing advertised products. Celebrities and popular social media personalities who engage in social media endorsements are referred to as influencers.  Causes and impact  Parasocial relationships are a psychological attachment in which the media persona offers a continuing relationship with the media user. They grow to depend on them, plan to interact with them, count on them much like a close friend. They acquire a history with them and believe they know the persona better than others. Media users are free to partake in the benefits of real relations with no responsibility or effort. They can control their experience or walk away from parasocial relationships freely. A media user's bond with media personas can lead to higher self-confidence, a stronger perception of problem focused coping strategies, and a stronger sense of belonging. However these one-sided relationships can also foster an impractical body image, can reduce self- esteem, increase media consumption, and media addiction. Parasocial relationships are seen frequently with post-retirement aged media users due to high television consumption and loss of social contacts or activities. However, adolescents are also prone to form parasocial relationships. This is attributed to puberty, the discovery of sexuality and identity, and the idolization of media stars. Due to women's generally greater empathic capacity , they are more prone than men to form parasocial relationships. Some results indicate that parasocial relationships with media personas increase because the media user is lonely, dissatisfied, emotionally unstable, and/or has unattractive relationship alternatives. Some can use these parasocial relationships as a substitute for real social contact. A media user's personality affects how they use social media and may also vary an individual's pursuit of intimacy and approach to relationships i.e. extroverts may prefer to seek social gratification through face-to-face interactions as opposed to mediated ones. Media users use mediated communication to gratify their personal needs, such as to relax, seek pleasure, boredom, or out of habit. In this era of social media and the internet media users have constant access to on demand viewing, constant interactions on hand held mobile devices, and widespread Internet access.  Parasocial breakup  Experiencing negative emotional responses as a result of an ending parasocial relationship, i.e. death of a television persona in a series, is known as a parasocial breakup. More intense levels of parasocial breakup could be predicted by loneliness and observing media for companionship.  Parasocial relationships with fictional characters  Parasocial relationships with fictional characters are more intense than with nonfictional characters, because of the feeling of being completely present in a fictional world. There is a desire for camaraderie that can be built through bonding over a fictional persona. Due to the span and breadth of media franchises such as the Harry Potter, Disney, and Star Wars series, consumers are able to engage more deeply and form strong parasocial relationships. These fictional parasocial relationships can extend further than watching the movies or reading the books into official and fan fiction websites, social media, and even extend beyond media to have an in-person experience at national and international theme park attractions.  Theoretical connections and measurement instruments  Rubin analyzed the process of parasocial relationship development by applying principles of uncertainty reduction theory, which states that uncertainty about others is reduced over time through communication, allowing for increased attraction and relationship growth. Other theories that apply to parasocial relationships are social penetration theory, which is based on the premise that positive, intimate interactions produce further rewards in the relationship and the uses and gratifications theory, which states that media users are goal driven and want media to gratify their needs. In 1956, T.M. Newcomb's (1956) reinforcement theory explained that following a rewarding interaction an attraction is formed. A gratifying relationship is formed as a result of social attraction and interactive environments created by the media persona. The most used measurement instrument for parasocial phenomena is the Parasocial Interaction Scale (PSI Scale), which was developed by Rubin, Perse, and Powell in 1985 to assess interpersonal relationships with media personalities. Mina Tsay and Brianna Bodine developed a revised version of Rubin's scale by addressing that parasocial relationship engagement is dictated by a media users personality and motivations. They identified four distinct dimensions that address engagement with media personas from affective, cognitive, and behavioral perspectives. The dimensions assessed how people see media personas as role models, how people desire to communicate with them and learn more about them, and how familiar they are to the individuals. Tsay and Bodine noticed how greater levels of interaction can be formed between the media user and the media persona because of the shift of media and mass communication in recent years. Media users are now able to choose how they want to interact with and initiate in their own media experiences online, such as fan groups, Twitter, and character blogs.

It was painted between 1627 and 1628 and is kept in the Louvre museum in Paris.  The myth  The work derives from Greek Mythology. According to Ovid's Metamorphoses, the nymph Echo fell in love with Narcissus, but he rejected her. Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, punished Narcissus by making fall in love with his own image reflected in a source, consuming himself with love for himself. At the place where he died, pushed the flower that bears his name: Narcissus.  The painting  Poussin illustrates this myth by representing three characters in an idyllic landscape: in the foreground, Narcissus, lying down; behind him, on the right, Eros, god of love; and on the left, sitting on a rock, Echo. Around the hair of young Narcissus are already blooming flowers to which he gave his name. Echo, leaning on a rock, seems \\"an elegiac and immaterial apparition\\".

History  The facility was built by architect Jean Chalgrin between 1773 and 1776 on the camp des Fain√©nants, a vacant lot that was outside of the city boundary until 1773. It was originally set to be the stable of the earl of Artois, the brother of Louis XIV who then became King Charles X. After the Revolution, the buildings were transformed into barracks that could accommodate 333 cavalry men and 530 infantry men as well as 224 horses. In November 1823, a royal order established a cavalry school and a trumpet school in the buildings. The schools were later transferred to Saumur, Maine-et-Loire in November 1824.

It was briefly the tallest building in El Paso upon its completion in 1954. The building housed the El Paso Natural Gas Company until 1996, when the El Paso Independent School District (EPISD) housed employees there for a few years. In 2018, the building has started to undergo renovations that are expected to be completed by 2020. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since February 13, 2018. Its most unique feature is the 21-foot tall flame weather beacon.  About  The Blue Flame Building or the El Paso Natural Gas Company Building is an 18 story building and 230 feet tall. It has a steel-beam internal structure and a basement. the exterior of the building is finished with granite. It was designed by the architectural firm of Carroll and Daeuble in 1952 using a design first created by architect, Kenneth Franzheim. It was constructed by the Robert E. McKee Construction Company who were awarded the contract in 1953. Upon its completion in 1954, the building was considered a \\"showcase of the latest in industrial construction\\" by the El Paso Times. The modern partition feature allowed flexible space planning. It was the tallest building in El Paso at the time of its completion and provided a view from the top into Ciudad Ju√°rez and the surrounding El Paso area. A unique feature of the building is the 21 foot high flame-like structure made of plexiglass and constructed by the Federal Sign and Signal Company. The flame was intended to be a weather beacon that would be lit up with different colors to reflect the changing weather forecast. When the flame was blue, that indicated no change to the weather. A red flame indicated warmer weather, while a gold flame meant cooler weather was coming. When the flame \\"flickered\\" that indicated wind or precipitation was forecast. The flame would be turned off temporarily from time to time in order to clean it. While the flame was in operation from its beginning, it had one operator for forty years who called the National Weather Service in order to know what color to light the flame.  History  The ground space for the building was sold for $75,000 by Dexter R. Mapel in 1949. Another $262,500 was sold to H.P. Kopf for \\"properties taken into the utility building site.\\" The building cost a total of $5 million upon completion. It was originally known as the El Paso Natural Gas Company building and was meant to house the company by the same name and provide a consolidated space for all of the employees. Other occupants of the building included the E.F. Hutton and Co. firm and there was commercial space for others on the first floor. When the building opened in 1954, it provided office space for 1,000 gas company employees, a coffee shop and 99-seat auditorium on the fifth floor and a hospital set-up on the third floor attended by a registered nurse. The sixteenth floor was for gas company executives and the president of the El Paso Natural Gas Company, Paul Kayser, and other management-level employees had offices on the seventeenth floor. The lobby, opening out to Texas Street depicted illustrations of El Paso Natural Gas Company work. The large flame- like structure on the top of the building was first tested in March of 1955 and finally turned on permanently a week later. The first time the flame was lit, it was red, indicating warmer weather was coming. An open house tour of the building also took place in March of 1955. During the Christmas season, the building would light up office windows at night in a cross-shaped formation. The practice ended during the energy crisis in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the El Paso Natural Gas Company decided to move to another building, though promising that the flame on top of the original building would remain in place. In 1986, El Paso County considered buying the building. County Judge Pat O'Rourke had pursued a deal that would include the Blue Flame Building and two other buildings for a total purchase of $10 million. Instead, in 1996, the El Paso Independent School District (EPISD) accepted the building as a gift from Southern Union Gas. EPISD would place many of its administrative staff in the building. However in 2000, EPISD superintendent, Gilberto Anzaldua, planned to move the employees out of the building and sell it for an appraised value of $4 million. Employees were moved out by July of 2001. By 2003, the school district was still considering whether or not to sell the building. It was eventually sold to Bob Jones, a businessman in El Paso in 2004 for around $1.6 million. In 2006, El Paso businessman, Paul Foster, purchased the building in a package deal. By 2018, the Housing Authority of the City of El Paso (HACEP) had started working on renovating the building to support offices and low-income apartments. On February 13, 2018, the Blue Flame Building was designated a landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. The landmark designation has provided tax credits that can be used for the projected $40 million renovation. The renovation has been slated to be completed by 2020.

Career Hart came through the youth ranks at local club Blackburn Rovers, though would depart without first-team experience and would subsequently take a football break. After a trial with Accrington Stanley, Hart would return with Rossendale United before featuring in the Accrington Combination League with Church Town. A move to Colne would follow, where he'd score over twenty goals in the 2012‚Äì13 North West Counties Football League Premier Division. Hart had a stint with Padiham after leaving Colne, prior to signing with Clitheroe in 2014. He spent one season with the Northern Premier League Division One North club, before being sacked. In 2015, Hart rejoined Colne for a second spell. Thirty-four goals would follow in the 2015‚Äì16 NWCFL as Colne won the title and promotion to the Northern Premier League division that he played in for Clitheroe. In June 2016, Hart secured a contract across the competition with recently relegated Ramsbottom United. Upon leaving Ramsbottom, Hart appeared for Nelson and, for a second time, Padiham. October 2017 saw Hart head to Northwich Victoria of the NWCFL. However, the forward would return to Padiham in the succeeding March. He would be on the move again within months, penning terms with Longridge Town. Hart, after thirty goals for Longridge, switched England for Bhutan in June 2019, as he joined Premier League side Thimphu City; managed by fellow Englishman Josh Shepherd. He scored on his competitive debut against Druk Star, with another goal following in his second match versus Paro. Hart scored twenty goals and assisted nine more for Thimphu City. Hart departed at the end of 2019, subsequently joining I-League team Punjab. He departed Punjab in January 2020 after five appearances. Soon after, Hart signed with Australian Victorian State League Division 2 outfit Doncaster Rovers. Personal life In April 2015, Hart was sacked by Clitheroe after he was recorded having sex with a woman in the club's home dugout while wearing their training kit. Anne Barker, chairwoman of Clitheroe, said Hart brought the club into disrepute. His girlfriend, the mother of his two children, left him after the incident.

In 1734 he was borne on the books of HMS Blenheim, a harbour-ship, and his first seagoing experience would seem to have been in 1736 on board Windsor. In her and afterwards in HMS Ipswich and HMS Anglesea ‚Äî in which last he was present at the abortive attack on Cartagena in April 1741‚Äîhe served for about five years. He passed his examination on 3 September 1741, being then, according to his certificate, more than twenty-two, and having been more than ten years at sea. Four days afterwards he was promoted to be lieutenant of the Duke on the home station. In 1743‚Äì4 he was a lieutenant of HMS St. George, from which he was taken by Vice-Admiral Davers in October 1744 to go with him to the West Indies in HMS Cornwall, in the rating of midshipman extra. In August 1745 Davers gave him a commission as fifth lieutenant of HMS Cornwall (though the ship was only allowed four), and in November appointed him to command the Vainqueur tender. Eighteen months afterwards he was recalled to HMS Cornwall, in which he was present in the action off Havana on 1 October 1748 (see Sir Charles Knowles), and was afterwards promoted by Knowles to command the Weasel sloop and sent home. He paid her off in May 1749. In March 1755 he commanded HMS Seaford and afterwards HMS Raven in the English Channel, and with the western squadron till posted, on 2 December, to HMS Monarch. During the next two years Taylor held several temporary commands - HMS Magnanime, HMS Neptune, HMS Magnanime again, HMS Royal William ‚Äî and early in 1758 was appointed to HMS Ramillies, the flagship of Sir Edward (afterwards Lord) Hawke, with whom he continued through 1758 and the blockade of Brest in 1759, while Hawke was teaching the navy what the blockade of Brest meant. After the many months at sea the Ramillies was in need of refitting, and when preparing to leave Torbay on 14 November Hawke struck his flag in the Ramillies and went on board HMS Royal George. Taylor remained in the Ramillies, and took her round to Plymouth to be repaired. The following February (1760) she sailed, one of a squadron of three-deckers under the command of Admiral Boscawen. A violent westerly gale drove them back; the ships were separated; the weather was thick and hazy, and the Ramillies was suddenly found in dangerous proximity to the Bolt Head. She let go her anchors, which brought her up for the moment; but the storm was at its height, the cables parted, and the ship was hurled on the rocks.

Duvall after he was charged with corruption by the state. Duvall had been elected mayor in 1925 with the support of the Ku Klux Klan, and the Marion County Republican Party had close Klan ties. The City Council and school board both were composed of Klan-supported members. Opposition arose by 1929 to both the Klan and to the corruption in the city government. Sullivan's victory was seen as a rebuke of the Ku Klux Klan. The Republican nominee was businessman Alfed M. Glossbrenner. Sullivan spent much of the campaign in a hospital bed after being injured in an airplane crash. Sullivan received strong support from African American and Catholic voters. Coinciding mayoral elections across the state also saw Klan-supported, generally Republican, mayors voted out and replaced by new, generally Democratic, mayors.

Although using traditional painterly techniques, her vibrant paintings explore the impact of new technologies on perception. Inspired by a lifelong love of the San Francisco Bay Area Figurative artists, mathematical theories such as the Fibonacci sequence, the resonant tones of Latin phrases, African masks, and antique Roman vessels, Jylian's Gustlin's work is a modern hybrid between the past and the present. The noted activist, singer and friend of Gustlin, Joan Baez wrote, > ‚ÄúI am fortunate enough to have Jylian as a friend. I know her as exuberant, > open, fun, funny, teasing, stubborn to the point of bullheadedness, and as a > splendidly free spirit. She has psychic tendencies, drives like a maniac, > and runs in the hills for hours on end, fair weather and foul. It is that > same energy which directs her hands and body to paint. My guess is the > actual painting is executed in the same trance she experiences as a runner. > The results are expansive, like the hills, with the colors instinctively > finding their place in the grand picture. She creates what I believe is > ‚Äúfine art.‚Äù She has been present to help me, a beginner, find ways to hurdle > over stuck points, and struggle with her suggestion to ‚Äúmake as many > mistakes as you can.‚ÄùIf that is the same as ‚Äútake as many risks as you can,‚Äù > it blends like a perfect palette with the rest of her life style, and the > viewer is the beneficiary of the whole package.‚Äù  Life and education  Gustlin is a native Californian and grew up in the Bay Area. She has been shaped by the technology explosion of Silicon Valley, and her art reflects her in-depth knowledge of technology. She studied mathematics and computer science at San Jos√© State University and received a BFA from the Art Academy of San Francisco where technology was emerging as an art medium. Combining her understanding of computers and her love for art, she became a graphics programmer and art director for Apple Inc. When you add art, you add design, and design makes science, technology, and mathematics, beautiful. Exploring these subjects and their intersection with design inspires new ideas for Gustlin. When she is painting, it is with impassioned emotions, allowing her personal experiences to flow through the paintbrush directly on to the canvas. This extension beyond mathematics and science is the creative language of art. \\"While painting in acrylic and oil paints, her artwork often conveys the same complex layered effects possible in computer programs\\" Working at a large technology company gave Gustlin an unusual understanding of how patterns and layers on a computer screen might be reflected in actual paint layers. During the last twenty years as a full-time artist, she has designed and drawn many of her preliminary concepts on the computer. Technology today is very advanced, allowing paint and drawings to merge with precision, creating complex layered effects when using different computer programs. In addition to two-dimensional design, Gustlin uses three- dimensional modeling texture programs to produce character and movement of the figure through animation. With her software skills, glitch (the use of digital errors to manipulate digital information) and data visualization software, she creates new directions and accidental meetings of shapes, forms, and color.  Art work  = Figurative paintings = Figurative paintings have been Gustlin's love for her entire life. As a child, she drew paper dolls and their colorful clothes for herself and her friends; dolls in endless combinations and colors. While consistently drawing figures, she explored the human body‚Äîthe choreography of the limbs and body in a fluid motion. Today, she uses the colors to create emotions on the abstracted figures, leaving the interpretation of the painting to the viewer. Figurative work is the interpretation and illusion of a figure painted on a board or canvas. We must ponder to what extent our identity is formed by external constraints and the situations by those around us before painting can commence. Within many layers and textures, Gustlin questions, ‚ÄúHow do we shape who we are? How do we construct our individual and societal identities? And how do we transform our anonymous lives into a moment where we are living in harmony?‚Äù In Gustlin's paintings, the human body emerges from the background and moves through our emotions. The rich patterns of shapes and colors bring the figures to life and challenges our imagination. The layers of paint and interwoven color is the beauty and explosive atmosphere Gustlin brings to the human body. The moody, yet qualitative, emotions are expressed in her paintings as they emerge into the foreground, bringing the complex, layered textures of the figure into our space as we sense its presence and feelings. Gustlin's abstracted figures present non-verbal language, leaving the viewer to experience the painting, gathering their own information. The etymology of figurative painting is gathered through body language. The gestures of the form or expressions of the face convey meaning, emotions, and thoughts. With abstracted figures, it is up to the viewer to define the meaning of the space. \\"The figurative characters are frequently set in an alien-like landscape, temperamental and ominous, yet simultaneously depicting a sense of future self reflection.\\" If a face is put on the body, people are drawn more to the face, instead, Gustlin wants the viewer to pull back and view more of what is happening with the body in the space of the canvas. The same can be said about the seemingly nude figure because clothing ties a figure to a style or specific time-period. The body poses are meant to be thought thought-provoking and inspirational, creating different viewer experiences. ‚ÄúGustlin continues to amaze us with her strength in a variety of subject matter. Very rarely is an artist accomplished in both figurative and abstract styles ‚Äî and as well regarded for tackling both.‚Äù Gustlin's figures are created with overly exaggerated long legs. The feet are large because she believes it grounds the figures to the earth, like a tree growing long and tall, but always with roots attached to the ground. The stances represent the stories we carry in our body and let the viewer interpret the movement in the painting. \\"The sketchy quality of her figures and heavy drips of pigment allows the viewer to better experience the hand of this artist, as she attacks her surfaces with a savvy guilelessness and assured fluidity.\\" The colors in her work come from the palate of nature. The hours she spends trail running in the mountains gives her inspiration from the colors of wildflowers, hillsides, redwood trees jutting into the blue skies, and the deep blues of the shadows. = Fibonacci = Gustlin is shaped by technology at her fingertips and her art reflects the in-depth knowledge of technological manipulation. Figures have always been an important part and the foundation of her art; however, she also creates abstract paintings with Fibonacci sequence numbers producing complex and layered paintings. Fibonacci calculations create rectangles and shell spirals based on incrementally increasing numbers, and she exploits the relationship of Fibonacci numbers and combines circles in Fibonacci patterns to produce paintings. The characteristics of mathematical entropy are the basis for many of her abstract works. Approaching the figures from a mathematical and an emotional perspective, she incorporates the golden ratio, giving the finished piece the dynamic purity of expression. Perhaps a clearer way of explaining this would be: ‚ÄòDiscovered by Pythagoras, the golden ratio is when a line is divided into two parts so that the whole length divided by the long part is also equal to the long part divided by the short part.‚Äô The golden ratio is a line that becomes divided so that the entire line has the same ratio to the smaller segment. Pattern recognition can be very useful in paintings and can even represent mystical or profound numbers in a painting. She explores the relationship of Fibonacci numbers and how it intersects with the arts in every new design. However, when painting, free expression and personal experiences flow through the paintbrush and directly onto the canvas. This extension beyond mathematics and science is the creative language of art. \\"An especially intriguing [Fibonacci] piece by the San Francisco Bay Area's acclaimed computer-programmer-turned artist, Jylian Gustlin, is layered with hundreds of paints, archival and metallic papers, and other mixed media, the image is based on shapes created by the ascending mathematical pattern known as the Fibonacci sequence. This piece stands as solid proof to the kids that math really can be used after they graduate!\\" = Entropy = The ‚ÄúEntropy‚Äù series began as she was exploring different types of mathematical equations and was heavily influenced by the word entropy, the literal meaning of which is: ‚Äúlife flows from low to high.‚Äù. While trail running, she observes the chaos in the forest and creates designs in the emotional landscapes of her mind. In her studio, she uses that chaos of ideas and the reality of the landscape in the adaptions of her entropy paintings. \\"Just as she challenged the creative limitations of the latest computer software, Gustlin experiments with a variety of materials to discover their effects. Working with two-part epoxy resin, oil and acrylic paints, charcoal, wax, gold leaf, pastel and graphite on board, Gustlin draws, paints, scratches on her surfaces.\\" Entropy is used to describe how things in nature generally change from an orderly system to a changed or more disordered system. If the water is poured from a pitcher or glass on to a table, the water cannot reverse itself and return to its original state. The water also has a changed appearance from contained in within the pitcher in a cylindrical look to a large flat position, even forming small droplets as it continues to spread itself. The amount of water does not decrease but it changes its appearance. Temperature can change the way the water appears as it boils over on to the surface or becomes steam and rises into the air. The chaos ensued after change is the entropy. The disorder can take multiple forms and visually change the experience of the change. An artist can squeeze paint from a tube, and it forms a spot on the canvas. If a brush is run through the paint, the paint spreads and is intense in color in some places on the canvas and minimized on in other places. When water is added to the paint, the paint expands across the canvas and becomes lighter in color. With all of the uses of the paint, the paint can never be returned to the original system‚Äîthe tube. All aspects have changed the paint into a disordered or changed system. \\"With her background in computer science and mathematics, she has a heightened understanding of how studying patterns and layers on the computer screen helps her to lay down the bones of a painting while remaining loose enough to maintain an organic and painterly presence\\". Entropy meets up with time and it would not surprise anyone if at the end of the day Gustlin's studio was a mess, and if she left the mess at night and cleaned it the next day, the studio would have a different configuration. This is entropy, the growth of chaos and with an order of change coming out of that chaos. The series explores nature; the ever-changing environment from calm to chaos in a moment. The ‚ÄúFibonacci‚Äù series explores the structure of the world through mathematics‚Äîthe calculated sequence of events. When uniting the figurative, ‚ÄúFibonacci‚Äù and ‚ÄúEntropy‚Äù series, they become intertwined as she applies paints, colors, and lines. Gustlin perceives the world as interconnected and seamlessly designed, providing her ideas for the three series.

Her father was a banker, with two sons, Marc-Andr√© and Arthur. The family was Jewish and moved in 1864 to France due to pressure to convert religion. Her father would have to travel back to Odessa for business and spent half of each year there. Marie was a political republican interested in the arts and sciences and held popular salons in France. She was close friends with physiologist Claude Bernard. Raffalovich grew up aware of her advantages and studied political economy. She translated works on the lives of Cobden and Lord Shaftesbury. Her brother Andr√©'s held literary salons in London where she would act as hostess. Irish question Stories and details about William O'Brien's highly publicised arrests during the Plan of Campaign lead both the mother and daughter to become interested in Ireland and the political situation there. Raffalovich began to write to O'Brien and eventually met him in 1889. After a brief courtship they were engaged. Raffalovich converted to Catholicism. This was a disappointment to her father but her own writings show that she did not do this purely for the marriage. Her brothers both followed her to this end. While she gave up her childhood religion, Raffalovich did not give up her Jewish identity. She married O'Brien on 11 June 1890 and the wedding was attended by Charles Stewart Parnell, a major gathering of the Irish party before they split later in the year. Raffalovich moved to Ireland with her husband after the wedding and was accepted quickly into the social groups. She was particularly close with Anne Deane and Henrietta Mitchel Martin. Her husband relied heavily on Raffalovich as a funding source, secretary and nurse during the periods of his career where his health was poor. She was the financial accountant and they lived as simply as possible so they could give as much to the poor as possible. In 1895 O'Brien refused to pay off debts incurred during the 'Plan of Campaign', choosing instead to go bankrupt. The couple retired to a cottage in Westport, County Mayo where they worked together on farming, dog breeding and writing. They supported local fisheries financially where possible. Raffalovich wrote a couple of novels which describe the time. While based in Westport Raffalovich, with local nuns, founded various craft industries and ensured the availability of markets in Paris for the lace locally produced. She worked with Sister Mary Eustace Eaton of the Harold's Cross Hospice for the Dying and wrote a biography of her life in 1923. Having had no children and with her husband unwilling to adopt, Raffalovich chose to support girls who still lived with their families but lacked other advantages. The results of the Irish Famines were still visible among the people in Connacht while the couple were living there and they were actively involved in local relief work in 1897‚Äì1898. O'Brien was clear that land redistribution was the means for ameliorating the situation and Raffalovich became the primary backer of the United Irish League. It was this that lead to the initial reunion of the Irish Parliamentary Party in 1900, though O'Brien left once more only 3 years later. Raffalovich continued to fund his political activities despite the heavy financial expense when he founded the daily newspaper, the Cork Free Press. When they moved to Bellevue House, Mallow, County Cork in 1912 Raffalovich took on local charity work again and wrote extensively on both religious and political topics for the newspapers including a women's column on women's education and women's involvement in local government for the Cork Free Press. Despite her work on women's rights, Raffalovich was not a suffragist. She did not believe in a woman's right to vote. Although her husband was in favour of it and she appeared with him when he spoke, she never supported it and refused to allow her name to be added to the electoral register when women won the right to vote. Raffalovich's mother continued to live in France and Raffalovich felt very connected to the country where she had grown up. The couple supported the allied cause and Raffalovich had no pity for Sinn F√©in when they seemed to endanger the allied war effort. Her husband was less unforgiving and they had to disagree on the topic. The war eliminated what wealth Raffalovich had through the loss of the family investments in Russia and Germany. Her finances had supported her husband's political career and that career also ended with the 1918 election. After politics For about ten years the couple lived in retirement until O'Brien died in 1928. Raffalovich felt it was her duty to ensure his memory was intact and she spent some years working through the papers and documents he left behind. She worked with his biographer, Michael MacDonagh and published some of his work. She donated his papers to both University College Cork and the National Library of Ireland. She was awarded a Doctor of Letters in February 1938 from the National University of Ireland for this work. In earlier years Raffalovich had considered that she would join her friend's convent if her husband died but in 1933 she realised she was too old for such a change and that her home in Cork was too large for her alone, she moved back to France near Amiens, to live with sisters Fernande and Lucie Guilmart who had been pupils of the Amiens orphanage and school she had supported since the 1880s. She and the sisters become friends when they visited her in Ireland in the early 1930s. They took care of her afterwards. Raffalovich called them ‚Äòthe best daughters a childless old woman could have‚Äô. Raffalovich was still living in France when it was invaded by Germany during the Second World War. The sisters ensured her escape with them to the region near the Pyrenees. Eamonn de Valera prevented a public collection of funds to help the three women who had been reduced to near destitution by events. He claimed the government would provide for her but sent a single amount of ¬£150 through the Irish consulate to Vichy. Paul O'Dwyer ensured a collection of money through the New York Irish. However she was extremely impoverished by the end of the war though she continued to live with the Guilmart sisters this time at Neuilly-St Front, near Soissons. Lucie died in 1957; Fernande outlived her. She died at Neuilly on 8 January 1960.

History The subdistrict is named after Khlong Somdet Chao Phraya, a khlong (canal) that runs through the area to the west and ends at the Khlong Bang Sai Kai in the neighbouring district Thon Buri. It has a total length of 2.5 km (1 mi), a width of 4‚Äì11 m (13‚Äì36 ft) and an average depth of 0.6 m (1 ft 11 in). Currently, it is only a small waterway. Its name \\"Somdet Chao Phraya\\" is a high-ranking of Thai aristocracy in Rattanakosin period, since it was excavated during reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV) by the nobility of this rank in the Bunnag family as well as being their residence. Not only this khlong, but also including other khlongs in Khlong San neighbourhood most of them were excavated by members of Bunnag family, such as Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse, Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Phichai Yat, and Somdet Chao Phraya Sri Suriwongse. In addition, they are also the renovators of many wats (temple) in the area, for example Wat Phichai Yat, Wat Anongkharam etc. In those days, Khlong Somdet Chao Phraya also has another name \\"Khlong Khanon Maenam\\", which means costums house river canal. Because it was the location of the customs house and also the site of royal warehouse, with Talat Ban Somdet, the local market that was the source of imported products from foreign countries as well. This area has been a community and market that has been a mixture of people of various races and religions for over 200 years since the early Rattanakosin era. In 1954, Talat Ban Somdet caught fire.

Henry (1804 - July 30, 1865) was a physician and politician, who is best known for his friendship with eventual President Abraham Lincoln. Henry received patronage appointments to Oregon Territory through Lincoln from 1852 onwards, first as an Indian agent and then as Surveyor General of Washington Territory. He died when the steamer Brother Jonathan ran aground near Crescent City, California and sank.  Life  Born in Richfield, New York, Henry gained his medical degree in 1827 from Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio. After a series of failed business ventures in Michigan and Louisville, Kentucky, Henry married Eliza Broadstreet and moved to Springfield, Illinois in October 1832. In 1832 and 1833, Henry assisted with the cholera outbreaks in St. Louis and Jacksonville, Illinois, gaining recognition as an expert in treatment of cholera.Pratt, 1944, pp. 5-6 Henry met Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, quickly becoming friends, though Henry was five years older.Pratt, 1944, p. 6 Henry became heavily involved in politics. He was one of three commissioners responsible for overseeing the construction of the State Capitol in 1837. Accused of allowing cost overruns, he was exonerated by an investigating committee suggested by Lincoln.Pratt, 1944, p. 7 After Mary Todd broke the engagement with Lincoln on January 1, 1841, he regularly sought out Henry's company.Pratt, 1944, pp. 7-8 A fellow state senator later recounted, \\"Mr. Lincoln boarded at William Butler‚Äôs, near to Dr. Henry‚Äôs, where I boarded. The missing days, from January 13th to 19th, Mr. Lincoln spent several hours each day at Dr. Henry‚Äôs; a part of these days I remained with Mr. Lincoln. His most intimate friends had no fears of his injuring himself. He was very sad and melancholy, but being subject to these spells, nothing serious was apprehended.\\"Ida M. Tarbell, The Life of Abraham Lincoln, Volume I, p. 180. in In 1850, Henry assisted in the formation of the Illinois State Medical Society and was appointed Vice-President.Pratt, 1944, p. 8 = Oregon = In 1850, Lincoln wrote a letter to Thomas Ewing, the first Secretary of the Interior, urging Henry's appointment as a patronage appointment as an Indian agent.Roy P. Basler, editor, The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Volume II, p. 78 (Letter to Thomas Ewing, March 22, 1850). in Later than year on June 24, 1950, Henry received an appointment as an Indian agent for the Oregon Territory, however he did not leave until April 6, 1952, taking his wife and five children. The family arrived in Lafayette, Oregon in October, where he began practicing medicine and accepted an appointment as deputy surveyor of Yamhill County.Pratt, 1944, pp. 14-15 In 1853, he successfully ran for a seat representing Yamhill in the Oregon Territorial Legislature, serving in the 6th Legislative Session from December 1854 to February 1855. In 1855, he participated in the Rogue River Wars.Pratt, 1944, p. 15 As a member of the Oregon Volunteer militia, he served as commissary, and reportedly favored the genocide of Native Americans. In 1856, Henry was appointed physician to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, receiving an annual salary of $2000, more than could be achieved by farming. He arrived at the reservation in May 1856, later providing among the most detailed accounts of the health situation in Oregon's early reservations. His reports indicate that up to two-thirds of the population of the settlement were sick, all of which were under his care as the sole doctor. Henry and Lincoln corresponded regularly by mail even after Henry moved to Oregon. On July 4, 1860, Lincoln wrote, \\"Long before this you have learned who was nominated at Chicago. We know not what a day may bring forth; but, to-day, it looks as if the Chicago ticket will be elected.\\"Roy P. Basler, editor, The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Volume IV, p. 81-82 (Letter to Anson G. Henry, July 4, 1860). in In May, Lincoln had received the nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate and would go on to win the presidential election. One of Lincoln's first presidential appointments was to name Henry as Surveyor- General of Washington Territory, succeeding James Tilton, and serving from 1861 to 1865. Henry visited Washington, DC in the spring of 1863 where Lincoln insisted that he stay and accompany him in a visit of the Army of the Potomac. Following the 1864 United States presidential election, Henry returned to Washington, DC in anticipation of a high political appointment in the Interior Department. Mary Todd Lincoln and Noah Brooks considered him an ally and sought his appointment as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. However, the President eventually informed Henry that he did not want to remove William P. Dole in favor of another friend.Pratt, 1944, p. 18 Disappointed, Henry traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where he was during the assassination of the president on April 14, 1965. In a letter to his wife, Henry recounted his reaction to seeing Lincoln's corpse and his attempts to comfort Mary Todd. Henry stayed in the White House for the next six weeks, acting as physician to care for the distraught Mary Todd, eventually accompanying her back to Chicago.Pratt, 1944, p. 19 After leaving Mary Todd Lincoln, he began making his way back to his family in Oregon. On July 28, 1865, Henry boarded Brother Jonathan in San Francisco for a voyage to Portland, Oregon. After running aground on the 30th, the vessel sank; killing over 200 passengers and crew, including Henry. On August 30, Mary Todd wrote Henry's widow, \\"We have both been called upon to resign, to our Heavenly Father, two of the best men & the most devoted husbands, that two unhappy women, ever possessed.\\"  Bibliography   References  Category:1803 births Category:People from Richfield, New York Category:University of Cincinnati College of Medicine alumni Category:19th-century American physicians Category:People from Springfield, Illinois Category:Physicians from Illinois Category:American infectious disease physicians Category:People from Lafayette, Oregon Category:Physicians from Oregon Category:United States Indian agents Category:American surveyors Category:Members of the Oregon Territorial Legislature Category:Rogue River Wars Category:Native American history of Oregon Category:Deaths due to shipwreck Category:People lost at sea Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:1865 deaths Category:19th- century American politicians ","title":"Anson G.

It is traditional to whitewash and decorate graves with flowers on Flowering Sunday. Today, the names Palm Sunday and Flowering Sunday are used interchangeably in Wales. Scholars Alan and Karen Jabbour have postulated that Flowering Sunday might be connected to Appalachian and Liberian Decoration Day cemetery traditions. Flowering Sunday is also known as Blossom Sunday in some portions of England.  History of Welsh cemetery decoration  Flowering Sunday cemetery cleaning and decoration traditions may have begun as an Easter celebration or seasonal rite before becoming more commonly associated with Palm Sunday. According to historical documentation gathered by Early Tourists in Wales, there are two distinct but related Welsh cemetery decoration traditions relating to the placing of flowers and other plants. The first cemetery decoration tradition involves decorating the grave immediately after burial and then at intervals afterwards, meaning that flowers could be seen in church and cathedral graveyards throughout the year. According to the \\"Early Tourists in Wales project\\", Flowering Sunday is the second cemetery decoration tradition which is today practiced on the Saturday before Palm Sunday (Sul y Blodau in Welsh, literally ‚Äòflowers Sunday‚Äô but often translated as ‚Äòflowering Sunday‚Äô). As with the first cemetery decoration tradition, graves are cleaned or whitewashed and then decorated. Contemporary accounts indicate that Flowering Sunday became widespread in southeast Wales and nearby parts of England beginning in the mid-19th century. = Earliest recorded practices = Evidence suggests that before 1800 flowers were put on graves on Easter Sunday in some parts of Wales. Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg, 1747-1826) and others recorded cemetery decoration during other times of the year on Whit Sunday, St. John the Baptist‚Äôs Day, and Christmas Day. As early as 1786, cleaning and flower decorations were attested by William Matthews during a tour of South Wales. Richard Warner attested in 1797 \\"the ornamenting of the graves of the deceased with various plants and flowers, at certain seasons, by the surviving relatives\\" and noted that Easter was the most popular time for this tradition. By 1803, Malkin's observations reflect the shift away predominantly associating the custom with Easter: 250px Peter Roberts characterized these practices in 1815: \\"In many parts, and especially in South Wales, the friends of the deceased take much and laudable pains to deck the grave with flowers. A bordering of slate or stones, is nicely run around it, and the top bound in by stones, laid with taste, in a tessellated manner, which has an ornamental effect...\\" In 1829 Thomas Wallace, of Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire, published a poem which contains the first known reference to the custom being practiced only on Palm Sunday. By 1839, Charles Redwood referred to this tradition of cleaning and decorating graves on Palm Sunday as the \\"old custom\\": \\"All the village were there, engaged, after the old custom, in trimming and adorning the graves of their deceased relatives.

Modern practice  Flowering Sunday practices spread during the early 20th century to the majority of Wales and bordering parts of England. In the 21st century, Flowering Sunday is still practiced in Wales but artificial flowers and other changes in decoration practice mean that many graves are decorated throughout the year.

L√≥pez's husband and two sons were killed in the Battle of San Francisco, while the third died during . Five days before the Battle of San Juan, L√≥pez gave birth to a boy. L√≥pez recorded the dates of the battles in which she participated on a captured officer's sword. Those battles were Antofagasta, Pisagua, San Francisco, Tacna, Chorrillos, and Miraflores. In recognition of her service, L√≥pez was awarded three medals. Post-war life Like many other women involved in the War of the Pacific and despite her decorations, L√≥pez was forgotten by Chilean society after the war. She received a pension of 15 pesos and was cared for in her old age by her daughter, Ceferina Vargas. After L√≥pez's death, local newspapers noted the proportional tininess of her pension compared to male veterans of the war. =Death= L√≥pez died on 24 January 1904 of endocarditis in Chile's capital, Santiago and was buried in its General Cemetery. On 7 August 1910, Ceferina Vargas's instigation, a marble tombstone and an iron fence were erected on L√≥pez's grave. Veterans of the Pacific War, a marching band, and the Santiago Police Department marched in honor of L√≥pez to commemorate the finishing of her tomb.

It preserves the biodiversity of part of the watershed of the Taitaipenistouc River in the upper part of the Moisie River basin. History The government of Quebec in 2002 protected part of the watershed of the Taitaipenistouc River, banning activities such as mining, forestry and hydroelectric development. On 19 June 2003 the territory was given the legal status of proposed biodiversity reserve with the provisional name of Lake Bright-Sand Biodiversity Reserve (R√©serve de biodiversit√© projet√©e du lac Bright Sand). However, Lake Bright Sand itself is outside the proposed reserve, along the railway to the north of Poste Montagnais. In 2005 the Bureau d‚Äôaudiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE) was tasked with holding public consultations on the proposed Moisie River Aquatic Reserve and the proposed Lake Bright Sand, Lake Pasteur and Lake Gensart biodiversity reserves. In its report of 10 November 2006 BAPE recommended permanent protection for the Lake Bright Sand reserve, renamed the Taitaipenistouc Meanders Biodiversity Reserve. A conservation plan was drawn up by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, and Fight Against Climate Change (MELCC) and published in 2018. Location The Taitaipenistouc Meanders Biodiversity Reserve is in the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re- Nipissis. It is in the northeast of the Sept-Rivi√®res Regional County Municipality, to the east of the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway and southeast of Poste Montagnais. The reserve is about from the border with Labrador. It is southeast of Fermont, northeast of Sept-√éles and east of the proposed Moisie River Aquatic Reserve. The proposed reserve was to cover . After adjustments to better protect the watershed and to make it easier to identify the boundaries based on rivers or lake shores, the reserve was given an area of . Elevations range from , with an average elevation of . There is no road access, but float planes can land on several of the lakes, and in winter the reserve is accessible by snowmobile. Terrain The reserve protects a typical region of the Lake Br√ªl√© / Lake Fournier plateau. This is a huge plateau with rolling plains covered in drumlins, moraines, till, bogs and lakes. Most of the Taitaipenistouc Meanders Biodiversity Reserve is in the Taitaipenistouc drainage basin. The Taitaipenistouc River enters the reserve from the north and flows south through the reserve before turning to the northwest and leaving the reserve to join the Caopacho River. The Caopacho in turn flows south to join the Moisie River. Parts of the east and south of the reserve drain into the watershed of the Nipissis River, another tributary of the Moisie River. The reserve is in the Grenville geologic province, with basement rocks consisting mainly of metamorphic gneiss and paragneiss. There is some mafic bedrock in north of the reserve, including diorite and gabbro. The reserve is covered by a set of drumlins formed by glacial action. The floor of the Taitaipenistouc river contains fluvioglacial deposits of sand and gravel. Apart from the Strahler 4 Taitaipenistouc river, the reserve is mostly drained by headwater streams. There are about 20 small lakes, covering 6% of the reserve. Ecology The reserve has a cold, sub-polar and sub-humid continental climate. Vegetation has a short growing season. The bottom of the Taitaipenistouc river valley and some depressions hold peat bogs, which cover 20% of the reserve. The higher ground in almost 20% of the reserve holds old- growth softwood stands dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana). About 4% of the reserve has been disturbed by forest fires and is now occupied by jack pine (Pinus banksiana). Dry heaths on the steeper slopes and rocky outcrops of the peaks cover the remaining half the reserve, with shrubs, flowering plants, grasses, lichens, but hardly any trees. In 2013 a major forest fire affected half the reserve, so the above description may be inaccurate. Activities and restrictions The whole of the reserve is in the Saguenay beaver reserve, where the e Uashat mak Mani-Utenam Innu community has special hunting and trapping rights. The only land right that has been granted is for one vacation cottage on the lake at the north tip of the reserve. The reserve is crossed by two power transmission lines with a total length of . Prohibited activities since the area became a proposed biodiversity reserve include mining, drilling for oil and gas, forestry and power development. There are restrictions on any type of activity that may affect the natural environment, such as introducing new species, changing the water drainage, using fertilizers and so on. However, the reserve may be visited and the visitors are allowed to make fires and build rough shelters.

Described as a 1957 model, it was first shown in December 1956 in New York city. Only one was built. History The car that became the Corvette Super Sport began as a regular production 1956 C1 Corvette with Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) E56S001589. With original equipment including a Chevrolet small-block V8 engine, power windows and a hydraulic folding top, the car was a display model in the GM Building in Detroit. Starting on 26 April and finishing 28 June 1956 the car underwent a cosmetic upgrade, after which it went back on display. At some time after this Shop Order #90181 was issued to build the Corvette Super Sport, and the display car was selected to form the basis of the new project. The car was sent to the Styling Department, where the changes took place. The conversion cost $18,000. To make the Super Sport a 1957 model year car, it was assigned a new custom VIN that was a hybrid of 1956 and 1957 model year formats. Regular 1956 model car VINs started at E56S001001, where the \\"56\\" represented the year, while regular 1957 model year cars started at E57S101001, where the year field was updated to \\"57\\", and the first digit following the \\"S\\" was a \\"1\\". The VIN assigned to the Super Sport was E57S001589, retaining the last four digits of the donor car's original VIN. The Super Sport was first shown in New York city at the Waldorf Astoria Auto Show in December 1956. It also appeared at the Chicago Auto Show that same year. The car was featured on the cover of the June 1957 issue of Speed Age magazine. After appearing at car shows and returning to GM, the car was eventually sent to Chevrolet dealer Dick Doane Motors in Dundee, Illinois. From there it was bought by Ralph Poole Auto Sales of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and subsequently sold to a private owner in Albuquerque. Around 1960 the car was being raced at an illegal drag strip when it struck a telephone pole and suffered body damage. After the accident the car was relegated to a local junkyard, where it remained until being bought some time later by Albuquerque local Bill Hovey, who kept the unrestored car until 1997. At some point ownership of the car was in dispute. John Baldwin acquired the Super Sport wreck from Hovey, and began restoring the car. Following a complete restoration, the car appeared at the 2017 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance on 12 March 2017 in Fernandina Beach, Florida. Features To create the Super Sport, the original car's windshield, door glass, and windshield wipers were removed. The door top openings were closed by custom covers, and the body side coves had anodized aluminum panels fitted. The trailing end of the side coves had non-functional air scoops added. This feature was inspired by the two earlier SR-2 racing Corvettes; one built for Harley Earl's son Jerry, and one built for Bill Mitchell. Special taillamps were created for the car. On the interior, the floor panels were first covered with plywood and then anodized aluminum panels over that. Custom footrests were built. The instrument cluster and center console were redesigned, and the driveline tunnel got a custom cover. The door panels were unique to the car, and a tachometer was mounted on the steering column. The full-width windshield was replaced by two individual bubble windscreens also inspired by the SR-2s. This was the first Corvette to have a blue interior, the first to have leather seating, and the first to have interior cupholders. The original V8 engine was replaced by a new small-block V8 enlarged to . The engine was fitted with a Ramjet fuel injection system from Rochester, the first GM engine shown to the public with injection, and a preview of the system that would debut on production Chevrolets that year. The injection plenum was polished, and the engine also had chrome-plated aluminum valve covers, horn relay, voltage regulator covers and oil and radiator caps. The transmission was a 3-speed manual. The car rode on special US Royal XP-140 thin-stripe whitewall tires. References Further reading * External links * - Corvette Forum thread with pictures of the unrestored car.

Les Valois, 1328‚Äì1461 (Paris: A. Picard et fils, 1904), p. 32, no. 3132 (Miracula S. Martialis). Historical context The Miracula was written at the height of the Hundred Years' War and amidst a major revival of Saint Martial's cult. The first ostensio (public display) of the relics of the saint took place in 994, but in the 14th century they became common (being held in 1300, 1306, 1306, 1317, 1364, 1388 and 1399). Popes Clement VI (1343) and Gregory IX (1376) granted indulgences to pilgrims to Martial's shrine at his abbey in Limoges. The region around Limoges, the Limousin, suffered heavily during the war. In 1370, Limoges was besieged by the Black Prince and sacked. The land was ravaged by routiers. When a truce was announced between the English and the French, the relics of Saint Martial were put on display from 8 May until 14 June. The truce was officially signed on 18 August and came into effect in the Limousin on 2 September. The Miracula was compiled between August 1388 and the end of 1389 by an anonymous apostolic penitentiary. It may have been commissioned by the abbot of Limoges, Geraud Jouviand. Contents The Miracula gives short formulaic accounts of the miracles with minimum detail. They would not have met the standards of the Papal curia for verifying miracles, although they show some awareness of the need to prove that events had not followed a merely natural course. Each account contains the name of the witness to the miracle, his or her place of origin, the object of the miracle, the invocation of the saint, the fulfillment of the request and the fulfillment of the petitioner's vow made at the time of the request. Most of the miracles relate to the hardships of war. The display of Martial's relics brought food and pilgrims to the city when it was besieged by Geoffroy T√™te- Noire. Nevertheless, the universality of Martial's cult was stressed. He interceded for the English as well as French and in cases of French misbehaviour (such as the robbing of a priest). His petitioners included rich and poor, urban and rural, noble and serf, men and women. His range, however, was about ‚Äîall the miracles occurred within a radius of that length from Limoges. A later editor added a comment to the Miracula noting that the peace was attributed to the saint and there was a general hope that the Great Schism in the western Church would soon be healed.

In 1873 San Francisco civil engineer Allexey W. Von Schmidt built the State Boundary Monument in San Bernardino County, California near Needles, California. California Historic Landmark 859 In 1872 and 1873 Von Schmidt did a survey of the border between California and Nevada/Arizona. The California Historic marker is on the dirt road, Pew Road, also called River Road, 2.6 Miles South of the State Line; 14 Miles North of Needles. The marker is not at the current state boundary, as Von Schmidt made an error in his survey. A new survey in 1893 showed that the Von Schmidt line was 1,600 to 1,800 feet off to the west. The marker is at the southern end of the California-Arizona State boundary. In 1872, a dispute arose between Nevada and California about the location of the state's boundary. Nevada wanted the state divide to be the same as the Sierra Nevada mountain range divide. California wanted the line to the east of the mountain range. When California attained statehood in 1850, it adopted 120 degrees west longitude as its eastern border. Alt URL Between 1855 and 1900 there were six surveys to locate 120 degrees, with each locating 120 degrees of longitude differently. Von Schmidt applied for and was granted the contract to survey the state's frontier border east of the Sierra Nevada. In 1872 Von Schmidt using only a compass, a sextant and dead reckoning process set out with his crew to define the boundary. Von Schmidt was charged to measure and mark the boundary. Von Schmidt and his crew built stone markers and installed cast iron markers about one mile apart on the length of the state's boundary. Not many of the markers had foundations, so fewer remain today. A new survey in 1893 showed that the Von Schmidt line was 1,600 to 1,800 feet west of the actual 120 degrees. However, California and Nevada both recognize the 1872 Von Schmidt survey and the 1893 survey as the state line. Later the 1893 line was used. The exact location of the north-south California-Nevada border, between Lake Tahoe and the intersection of the southern boundary of Oregon at the 42nd parallel, was contentious and was surveyed and re-surveyed many time. 1872 Von Schmidt Survey, sierracollege.edu Fall 2009 ‚Ä¢ vol. 2 no. 2 hetahoeweekly.com The California Nevada Border War One of the few iron markers that has survived is a near Verdi, Nevada this is a National Historic Landmark called the 1872 California-Nevada State Boundary Marker. Allexey W. Von Schmidt Allexey W. Von Schmidt (1821‚Äì1906) came to California from New York City in the Eastern United States in 1849, as an American pioneer to prospect in the California Gold Rush. Von Schmidt heard about the gold at Sutter's Fort area of the Central Valley and came looking. Trained as a civil engineer and surveyor, he departed the gold prospecting camps, to return to surveying. In 1853 he surveyed Contra Costa County, California, Rancho San Miguel and a ranch in Yuba County. In 1855 he received a job to survey the land near Mono Lake. The job expanded and he surveyed down to Yosemite. Next he worked for the City of San Francisco. He worked on small and large projects. One of the large projects was to help built San Francisco's first dam and drinking water aqueduct system for San Francisco. Von Schmidt was a key engineer in San Francisco and worked on the San Francisco cable car system. In 1872 he started the survey of the state's boarder, a task that took two year to complete. Von Schmidt died on May 18, 1906 in San Francisco, having survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Allexey W.

In 1993, Ayala was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years.https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/performing- arts/article192754459.html Background Jorge Ayala was born in Cali, Colombia but grew up in Chicago. He spoke perfect English and was born with a distinctive high-pitched voice. While living in Chicago, he started off as a car mechanic for his father at General Motors. He soon became one of the biggest car thieves in the city, stealing cars for Chicago chop shops. As a side job, he also worked in bringing immigrants into the country over from Mexico. Ayala was first brought to Miami in 1979 by a job that required him transport a truck full of cocaine from Chicago to Miami. Upon arriving with the shipment, he ended up deciding to live in the state. Ayala started off his criminal career here by simply shaking people down as a \\"small-time\\" enforcer. Working for Blanco and the Medell√≠n Cartel Ayala was considered to be Griselda Blanco's top enforcer. He led a small crew which helped him carry out various crimes. Rivi's brother, Alonso Ayala, also worked as a sicario for Blanco. Killings Ayala pleaded guilty to three killings in 1993, but was believed to be responsible for roughly three dozen murders that took place throughout the Miami Drug War. =Johnnie Castro= In 1982, Griselda Blanco ordered Ayala to kill Jesus ‚ÄúChucho‚Äù Castro, one of her former enforcers. According to George Cadavid, a Miami police homicide detective, she wanted Castro dead after he had been hired to protect a drug supplier, but refused to carry out an unspecified order. However, Ayala claims that Blanco wanted Castro dead supposedly for an offense against one of her sons. The attempt on Castro's life occurred on February 6 that same year. That afternoon, Miguelitto Perez and Jorge Ayala drove up to the side of Jesus Castro's vehicle - while he was stopped at a red light - and performed a drive-by shooting with a silenced machine gun. The bullets, however, missed Jesus Castro and accidentally hit his two-year-old son, Johnny, who was unknowingly present in the car with him. Ayala was charged with the murder of Castro's son in August 1988. =Alfredo and Grizel Lorenzo= Acting on orders of Griselda Blanco, Ayala and his crew killed Drug-dealing married couple Alfredo and Grizel Lorenzo in their South Miami home on May 26, 1982. Their killings were the apparent result of a cocaine shipment which the couple had received from Blanco, but failed to pay her for. According to Ayala, Griselda Blanco had originally ordered the murder of everyone in the house, but he made sure that the kids of Alfredo and Grizel Lorenzo were not harmed. Additional murders *Jorge Ayala is said to have killed 11 members of Luis Mejia's gang in New York City during the summer of 1981 as well as Mejia's father, Octavio Mejia, in Miami that same year. *Ayala once told state prosecutors that in 1981 he accepted a $50,000 payment for killing a man for Blanco while her then-3-year- old son, Michael, was in the room. Law enforcement apprehension Jorge Ayala was arrested in connection with a Chicago bank robbery. It was during this time that authorities were also searching for Griselda Blanco's top hitman, whom they only knew by the name of \\"Riverita\\". Soon after his capture, they realized that he was the assassin they had been looking for. Trial & sentencing Jorge Ayala pleaded guilty in 1993 to three murders and was sentenced to life in prison - with the possibility of parole after 25 years. He had testified against Griselda Blanco in order to avoid getting the death penalty. If released, Ayala will be deported to Colombia.

The site was designated a National Historic Site in 1922. and was later designed as part of a World Heritage Site in 2009. Background During the Bakumatsu period, the Tokugawa shogunate was increasing alarmed by incursions by foreign warships into Japanese territorial waters, fearing that these kurofune warships would attempt the end Japanese self-imposed national isolation policy by force, or would attempt an invasion of Japan by landing hostile military forces. Numerous feudal domains were ordered to establish fortifications along their coastlines with coastal artillery located at strategic locations, and the shogunate made belated attempts to modernize its armed forces. Egawa Hidetatsu, daikan of the Nirayama Daikansho Jansen, Hall 1989, p. 815. was assigned a leading role in the reinforcement of Japanese coastal defenses around Edo Bay in 1839.Cullen 2003, pp. 158-159. As early as 1842, Egawa attempted to build a furnace to cast cannon in the village of Nirayama in the Izu Peninsula. After sending a student to study the design of a furnace which had been developed in Saga Domain based on Dutch technology, construction began on a new reverberatory furnace in November 1853. It was completed in 1855, and the first cannon cast at the site in 1858. The facility was used until 1864.Smith 1955, p. 6. In 1868, the Egawa clan purchased the facility from the Tokugawa shogunate and in 1872 it was acquired by Imperial Japanese Army, who performed some repair work in 1908. After it became a National Historic Site in 1922, control was transferred to the Home Ministry with Nirayama municipality assuming responsibility for upkeep since 1957. Design The facility consists of four furnaces, each made from refractory bricks, on a stone base, with a height of 15.7 meters. The design of the furnaces was taken from a Dutch book, Het Gietwezen in's Rijks Ijzer - geschutgieterij te Luik, which the Japanese had received via the Dutch trading post at Nagasaki. The southern pair of furnaces were completed in 1855 and the northern pair in 1857.

Corpus Christi College, MS 232 Thomas Markaunt (‚Äì1439) was a Fellow and benefactor of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University. He is best known for his sizeable bequest of seventy-five books to Corpus Christi library, which were lent out to the student body in a formal academic system of electio. However he is also of note for his extensive compilation of early University records, known as \\"Markaunt's book\\", which gained him a (sometimes disputed) historical reputation as an antiquarian. While the majority of his original bequest has not survived the centuries, the extensive electio records and surviving books have been the subject of much study. Biography Thomas Markaunt was born around 1382 to Cassandria and John Markaunt. He first appears in Corpus Christi records in 1413/14, as a magister of the University. Some later historians have asserted Markaunt gained a Bachelor of Theology during his time at Cambridge, but, while his Fellowship at the college required a Catholic priest's holy orders, such a claim is unsubstantiated by contemporary records. Similarly, Thomas Fuller unfoundedly claimed Markaunt attended Peterhouse, a claim repudiated by Robert Masters. Markaunt served as senior proctor of the University in 1417-18, when he was involved in a town and gown controversy. Some scholars of the University had posted a page of vulgar poetry to the gate of the Mayor of Cambridge's house. Markaunt was tasked with defending these scholars, criticising the town for prior incidents where the University was victimised. In 1418, the Mayor and commonalty formally complained about the university, citing Markaunt's name and position in the complaint, how it is now known. After this period, Markaunt is only sporadically accounted for in college records. On 14 October 1430, he was one of four witnesses for the University in the so-called 'Barnwell process', then forty-eight years old, according to contemporary records. This 'process' was concerned with establishing the college's privileges as above those of the bishop. From 1437 to 1439, he is listed in college records as directly below the Master of the college in order of seniority. Having recently become a confrater and consortis of the college, Markaunt died on 19 November 1439. He left behind a will, made on 4 November. His memorial in MS 232 (see below) reads: Bequest of books In his will of 4 November, Markaunt bequeathed seventy-five books‚Äîconsisting mainly of standard university textbooks, classical texts, and commentaries‚Äîto Corpus Christi college. These books were neatly catalogued - numbered, priced, particularized, and recorded with an incipit - in a register found in one quire of a parchment manuscript of Corpus Christi (call number: CCCC MS 323). This manuscript also contains Markaunt's will, and an exhaustive borrowing register of the books, in six quires. Markaunt had obviously been a keen and wealthy bibliophile, as the total value of these books amounted to ¬£104 12s 3d (in 2017 GPB, worth approximately ¬£67,266)Calculated from 1440 to 2017 currency using: with the most expensive volume, an anthology of Aristotle and his commentators entitled Liber moralis philosophie or Moralia magna, valued at ¬£10. This collection had been contrived under specific rules, so that they would be entrusted to Fellows of the college under oath or pledge, who would be decided by choice, or electio. Such systems were common in English and French universities at the time, and were well-established in monastery libraries, though Corpus Christi was much smaller than most colleges, so its systems was more concerned with \\"provid[ing] each fellow with as complete a collection of texts of Aristotle, logical texts, and commentaries on Aristotle by Averro√´s as his position warranted\\", rather than extracurricular items. In MS 323, the rules of this loan system are laid out (f. 1r-3r), and a register of the borrowers of these books - with the date, the Fellow's name, and the title of the book - catalogued from 1440 to 1517 and laid out in tedious detail (f. 18r-123r). The system determined, in detail, how custodians would be chosen, and what prayers would have to be recited to keep the books on loan, though the college didn't rigorously follow them, with Markaunt intending for the rules to be flexible. Through the 15th and 16th-centuries, Markaunt's books slowly disappeared from the college's collections. The first to disappear was the cheapest in the collection, a 12d volume on philosophy in 1460, and these books continued to disappear as Markaunt's system of electiones became less popular among scholars, up until 1517, when the records of electiones cease. Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury and Fellow/Master of Corpus Christi (1527-1553), attended the college at what could have been opportune time to record the current circumstances of the books, but no records were made and Parker's own bequest virtually ae. As of 1987, medieval historian C. R. Cheney was only able to identify five books of Markaunt's (nos. 15, 18, 21, 31, 72, 76) that still remained in the college's collection. \\"Markaunt's book\\" While in charge of the defense of the University in 1417, Markaunt compiled a collection of useful and relevant records, for his own personal use, transcribing several ancient statutes and privileges of the college. This book is now known as 'Markaunt's book' or 'register' (and sometimes archaically: Liber priuilegiorum et statutorum uniuersitatis Cantabriggie) and contains several invaluable historical resources of the college, including a unique collection of the university's statutes, and short account of the college's ceremony of inception. Robert Hare (d. 1611) used it extensively in his antiquarian works on Cambridge, and, after the college lost it twice, it was presented for him for safekeeping. In 1594, it was presented to the University, but it had been misplaced twice by the time of Thomas Fuller (1608-1661), who sombrely predicted that the invaluable work would never be recovered again. Fortunately, the work was recovered by Thomas Baker (1656-1740), and is currently stored in the University archives. Markaunt's proposed authorship of the book has been questioned by scholar Walter Ullmann: noting the absence of any \\"prima facie evidence of an internal or external character to justify the ascription\\" and the transcription of some records produced after Markaunt's death.. But this suspicion has been criticized by M. B. Hackett, citing the fact that the Liber priuilegiorum in Markaunt's catalogue is identical to the modern copy of Markaunt's book, which he takes as sufficient proof the book is \\"none other than Markaunt's\\". This collection of statutes has been regarded by archivist M. B. Hackett as \\"a most valuable and in some ways unique record of royal and episcopal priveliges, papal bulls and miscellaneous deeds\\". Catherine Hall, writing for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, maintains that, while \\"not unique of its kind\\", Markaunt's book \\"is of exceptional interest\\" and \\"modern scholarship still remains lastingly indebted to Markaunt for his transcripts and the records of his library\\". Because of this collection of books, Markaunt has gained a legacy as an antiquarian, especially among the college's historians, with Masters describing him as \\"one of the most eminent antiquaries of his time\\", but there survives no evidence of his antiquarian predilections beyond this, and his sizeable collection of books, according to Cheney. Hall has similarly been critical of this identification, claiming that the book \\"won for its compiler an unfounded reputation as an antiquary\\".

The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source. This page details related allegations, reactions, and investigations, in Europe.  European Union  Many senior EU figures have been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal. The European Commissioner for Taxation, Pierre Moscovici, has said that the European Union as a whole had a \\"duty\\" to prevent the kind of tax avoidance uncovered in the Panama Papers scandal. Moscovici told reporters the use of offshore companies to hide what he called \\"shocking amounts\\" of financial assets from tax authorities was \\"unethical\\". He estimated that the tax shelters resulted in an annual loss of some ‚Ç¨1 trillion in public finances, adding that the European Commission has attempted to tighten tax rules across the union since November 2014 due to the Luxembourg Leaks scandal, also revealed by the ICIJ, and that he hoped the extent of the Panama Papers revelations would spur countries to action. In a 2013 letter, unearthed by the Financial Times to the then president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron said that offshore trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency requirements as shell companies.  Andorra  The Panama Papers revealed that the Minister of Finance of Andorra, Jordi Cinca, while he was CEO of Orfund SA, maintained an offshore company called Mariette Holdings Inc, until its dissolution in 2002 for fear of discovery of his participation in these businesses. The business activities of Orfund had ties to the blood diamond trade, and the refining and sale of African gold. This company closed shortly before the civil war in Ivory Coast. The opposition demanded his resignation as a result. In response Cinca said that \\"if their connection would affect the Government of Andorra, will step down\\". Still, he did not.\\"Andorra Difusi√≥\\". \\"Andorra Difusi√≥ RTVA\\". \\"Portada de El Peri√≤dic d'Andorra\\". \\"Europa Press ‚Äì Orfund\\" \\"Libertad Digital\\"  Austria  Austria's financial market authority has announced that they will audit two Austrian banks that were mentioned in the Panama Papers ‚Äì Raiffeisenbank International (RBI) and .

A Cypriot online paper said \\"The Cyprus link stems from the fact that Fonseca runs an office in Cyprus and, more specifically, in Limassol. In a chart, the leaks name Cyprus as a tax haven (countries that offer little or no tax), although it has a corporate tax rate of 12.5%, the same as Ireland.\\"  Denmark  In September 2016, Danish tax authorities purchased Panama Papers data on 320 companies and some 500-600 individuals to investigate. Although the data came from an anonymous source, it was vetted with credible sample data.  France  Marine Le Pen French financial prosecutors opened a probe, and former President Fran√ßois Hollande declared that tax evaders would be brought to trial and punished.France opens probe after Panama leaks , Reuters (April 4, 2016). Also as a result of the leak, France restored Panama to its list of tax havens, from which Panama had recently been removed. Former French budget minister J√©r√¥me Cahuzac, who spearheaded a crackdown on tax fraud while in office, was a client of Mossack Fonseca and through them owned a Seychelles company named Cerman Group Limited, incorporated in 2009. When France investigated 2013 allegations by Mediapart that in 2000 Cahuzac had held undeclared assets in an account first in Switzerland, then Singapore, he resigned his cabinet post, protesting his innocence, but admitted a few months later that he indeed had hidden ‚Ç¨600,000 in a UBS account and then moved it to keep it hidden, \\"while continuing to lead France's clampdown on tax evasion\\". The French Socialist Party unanimously voted to expel him a week later. On the heels of the April 2013 \\"Cahuzac affair\\", President Hollande created the parquet national financier (PNF), a judiciary investigation unit specializing in large-scale fraud and corruption investigations. Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-time leader of the far-right-wing Front National (FN) and now a member of the European Parliament, already was the subject, along with his daughter Marine Le Pen and his staff, of a PNF tax fraud investigation. Drawing official scrutiny were an undeclared HSBC account containing ‚Ç¨2.2m in gold and coins, managed from Geneva by an aide through a trust based in the British Virgin Islands which was closed and then moved to the Bahamas in 2014; allegations of overbilling; misuse and comingling of campaign funds; and tax evasion. Jean-Marie Le Pen is also suspected of using his European Parliament funds for the campaign and administrative expenses of his French political party. Jean-Marie Le Pen is mentioned in the documents, along with his daughter Marine Le Pen, who is the current party leader, and Frederic Chatillon, an FN insider who is also a close friend of Marine. Among the three of them, they may have hidden as much as a million pounds in offshore accounts.  Greece  The Panama Papers confirmed that the politician Stavros Papastavrou, who was advisor of former Prime Ministers Kostas Karamanlis and Antonis Samaras, had been a member of the council of the Panamanian foundations, Green Shamrock Foundation and Diman Foundation, from 2005 to 2014. In 2006, he became deputy chairman of the Aisios Foundation, that still exists today. However, Papstavrou resigned from the Aisios Foundation in 2012. A number of Greek families with significant art collections were implicated in this scandal.  Iceland  Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ Gunnlaugsson, Prime Minister of Iceland, stepped aside on April 5, 2016. Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ Gunnlaugsson, elected after the 2008 banking collapse in Iceland, had pledged to clean up corruption in the banking system. But when Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ took his seat he did not disclose his 50% interest of Wintris, a company that owned bonds of one of the bankrupt banks, nor divest himself of it, until the day before a new law took effect on January 1, 2010 that would have required him to declare this conflict of interest. He sold his share to his wife, who owns the other half. The couple both come from wealthy families. When they bought Wintris he was working as a journalist and she is an anthropologist. Until his failure to disclose the asset, he apparently broke no laws. But the country remembers the 2008 financial crisis all too well and thought it had put it in the past. Since Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ negotiated on behalf of Iceland with creditors of failed Icelandic banks, the discovery that Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞'s wife is a bondholder caused so much outrage that 22,000‚Äì24,000 people attended an anti-government protest outside the parliament on April 4, 2016, almost 8% of the population. Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ suggested a snap election, but the other members of the coalition government did not want elections, just his resignation. On April 5, 2016, Prime Minister of Iceland Sigmundur Dav√≠√∞ Gunnlaugsson announced his resignation. The Reykjavik Grapevine and the news site Kjarninn revealed that President √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson had connections to Lasca Finance Limited, registered in 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. √ìlafur Ragnar had categorically denied any personal or family ties to companies in tax havens. The parents of his wife, Dorrit Moussaieff, operated the company 1999‚Äì2005. The financial statements of the Moussaieff family business show it received nearly ¬£7 million ($10.2 million US, ‚Ç¨9.1 million) in interest payments from Lasca during 2000‚Äì2005. In 2005 Moussaieff Jewelers Limited sold its 10% stake of Lasca to S. Dorrit Moussaieff's deceased father and her mother, now 86 years old and the registered owner of the Lasca ownership stake. Dorrit and her sisters Tamara and Sharon will inherit her fortune, considered among the largest in the world. Bjarni Benediktsson, Iceland's finance minister and the chairman of Gunnlaugsson's coalition partner, comes from one of Iceland's wealthiest families. He confirmed that he owned 33% of Falson & Co., a Seychelles shell company founded in 2005 to purchase real estate in Dubai. It was still active in 2009, when Benediktsson was already a member of parliament with financial disclosure requirements. He said he registered the company with tax authorities, and he was not aware that it was registered in the Seychelles. Minister of the Interior √ìl√∂f Nordal and her husband had powers of attorney for Dooley Securities S.A., an offshore company located in Panama. She said that the company was founded for her husband but was never used, so she did not think she had to disclose it. Hr√≥lfur √ñlvisson, the managing director of Gunnlaugsson's Progressive Party, says the Mossack Fonseca companies that list his name have been inactive a very long time, and were legal. Businesswoman Ingibj√∂rg P√°lmad√≥ttir and her husband J√≥n √Åsgeir J√≥hannesson have for several years financed their business dealings through a Panamanian company, Guru Invest, which owns shares in retailer Sports Direct through Rhapsody Investments (Europe), based in Luxembourg. Guru Invest paid around US$16 million to Glitnir bank after it crashed to cover the debt of Gaumur, one of J√≥n √Åsgeir's companies, and loaned ISK 100 million to J√≥n √Åsgeir's company √û√∫ Bl√°s√≥l through an offshore company he owns named Jovita. Asked by journalists at Kjarninn where that money came from, Ingibj√∂rg did not reply. Ingibj√∂rg is the primary owner of the 365 media group, which owns the Icelandic news outlets V√≠sir.is, television channel St√∂√∞ 2 and radio stations Bylgjan, and FM 957, none of which seem to be reporting this disclosure.  Ireland  The Irish Times newspaper handled the Irish component of the leak. Prominent Irish names listed included golfer P√°draig Harrington, property developer Sean Mulryan and the manager of Irish rock group U2, Paul McGuinness. The lists also included Stanley Watson, a senior partner of Ireland's largest tax-law firm, Matheson, who have led the creation of many of the Irish corporate tax management tools used by US multinationals in Ireland to avoid billions in US taxes. The list also included Irish Fine Gael political advisor, Frank Flannery.  Italy  Silvio Berlusconi, former Prime Minister of Italy On April 6, 2016, Italy's Procura of Turin ordered the Guardia di Finanza to investigate the 800 Italians contained in the Panama Papers' documents. Former long-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who had been already convicted for tax evasion and expelled from the Parliament, was included in the papers. Other notable people whose names are mentioned in the Papers include entrepreneurs Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, Flavio Briatore, Adriano Galliani, and actor Carlo Verdone. An investigation by ICIJ partner The Namibian found that the imprisoned mafioso Vito Roberto Palazzolo shielded his finances from Italian, Namibian and South African authorities with shell companies in the British Virgin Islands set up by a German banker in Hong Kong, Wolf-Peter Berthold, which they also used to transfer control of Palazzolo's assets to his son.  Malta  Konrad Mizzi, former Minister for Energy and Health and former Minister for Tourism, Malta The Panama Papers linked a minister in the government of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, and the prime minister's chief of staff, Keith Schembri, to shell companies in Panama. Furthermore, Mizzi's wife, Sai Mizzi Liang, who is Malta's trade envoy to China and Consul General for Malta in Shanghai, China, was also named as beneficiary, together with their children, of a trust based in New Zealand holding Mizzi's Panama shell company. Mizzi, until April 28, 2016 Minister for Health and Energy, and currently Minister for Tourism, is listed in the Panama Papers as the owner of a Panama shell company called Hearnville Inc. Indications in the Maltese press of Mizzi's links to an offshore trust did not prevent Mizzi from being elected deputy leader for party affairs of the ruling Labour Party on February 25, 2016, following a change in the party statutes to enable a sitting MP to be appointed. Mizzi stepped down as deputy leader of the Labour Party on April 28, 2016. Schembri, a businessman who managed the electoral campaign of the Labour Party in the 2013 Maltese general elections, and serves as chief of staff to Muscat, was reported to hold an offshore company based in the British Virgin Islands, and owns an anonymous shell company in Panama, called Tillgate Inc, held by a trust established for him in New Zealand. Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri acquired their shell companies in Panama, Hearnville Inc and Tillgate Inc respectively, via the Mossack Fonseca representatives in Malta, who also tried to open bank accounts linked to the two shell companies of the two politically exposed persons in various jurisdictions. The owner of a third anonymous shell company in Panama, Egrant Inc, whose existence was revealed in the same document referring to the other two companies, remains unknown, although the strict secrecy observed in its acquisition, including the avoidance of e-mail communications and the utilization of communications via Skype, have fuelled strong suspicions that a third top Maltese politically exposed person is involved. In a 2015 declaration of assets, dated February 8 and submitted to the Maltese Parliament at the end of March 2016, which Muscat said he'd been shown in draft form before the Panama Papers were leaked, Mizzi listed the trust in New Zealand and the shell company in Panama. As of April 28, 2016 a report on the matter commissioned by the Government of Malta by an unnamed international audit firm was still pending. On April 28, 2016 Muscat announced a cabinet reshuffle; Mizzi lost his ministerial portfolio of Health and Energy, but was retained as a minister without portfolio in the Office of the Prime Minister. Malta is the only member of the European Union that have a minister implicated in this scandal and to date. Not withstanding Mizzi and Schembri's involvement in this scandal they still hold very high positions in the Maltese government. Mark A. Sammut wrote a book about the case, called L-Aqwa fl-Ewropa. Il-Panama Papers u l-Poter (The Very Best in Europe. The Panama Papers and Power). In October 2017, Daphne Caruana Galizia, a blogger who led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption in Malta, was killed by a car bomb near her home. Since then Malta, as a EU Member State, has been required to strengthen the transparency of its registers of corporate ownership, showing who ultimately controls every company within its jurisdiction. The Malta Financial Services Authority was demerged from Malta's Registry of Companies in 2018 in order to focus on separate regulatory roles and duties. The Registry of Companies is a stand-alone agency and is known as the Malta Business Registry.  Norway  The Norwegian Tax Administration expects to demand access to information from DNB (Norway's largest financial services group) about approximately 30 companies formed by DNB that are owned by Norwegians, 20 of whom are living in Norway. 200 Norwegians are on the client list of Mossack Fonseca.  Portugal  The ICIJ's Offshore Leaks Database shows that Portugal had 246 Offshore Entities, 300 Officers, 40 Intermediaries and 175 Addresses linked to the activities described in the Mossack-Fonseca papers, with newspapers reporting the involvement of several politicians, government officials, bankers and company managers. As of May 2017, there were no criminal or judicial consequences for any of the involved.  Russia  Russian president Vladimir Putin with Russian businessman and oligarch Arkady Rotenberg The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, one of the newspapers participating in the project that made the papers public, described the connections of various individuals listed in them to Russian president Vladimir Putin. They quoted Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman and US State Department documents saying that Russia is a \\"kleptocracy\\" and a \\"mafia state\\" respectively. The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung reported about $2 billion had moved through a network of companies associated with Russian firms and individuals in \\"just a few years\\" and the companies appeared to have been used for \\"questionable business transactions\\". Putin has criticized offshore companies as \\"unpatriotic\\" on several occasions since 2011 and in 2013 a law was passed banning foreign bank accounts for government officials. Putin's name does not appear in any of the records released to date, but those of his associates do. Construction billionaires Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, musician Sergei Roldugin and business magnate Alisher Usmanov are mentioned in the leaked documents, as are Putin's long-standing friend, billionaire Gennady Timchenko, as well as his press secretary's spouse, his cousin, and former KGB colleagues, as well as several oligarchs connected to Mossack Fonseca shell companies. Sergei Roldugin, a cellist with the St Petersburg orchestra who is the godfather of Putin's eldest daughter and who has been described as Putin's \\"best friend\\", appears prominently in the Panama Papers. According to the leaked papers, Roldugin acquired assets worth at least $100 million, including a 12.5% stake in Video International (Russia's largest television advertising firm), companies that own stock options for some of Russia's biggest companies and the rights to loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2008, a company controlled by Roldugin joined with several other offshore companies to help \\"another Putin insider\\" acquire control of Kamaz, Russia's largest truck manufacturer, and obtain investment from German carmaker Daimler AG, $250 million for 10% of Kamaz. Sandalwood, another company in which Roldugin and other insiders have an interest was issued lines of credit between 2009 and 2012 worth $800,000 by Russian Commercial Bank (RCB) in Cyprus, then a wholly owned subsidiary of VTB Bank, largely owned by the Russian state. Panama Papers documents indicate that Roldugin companies received several loans with no collateral, or at very low interest rates, or never repaid. In 2013, several shell companies linked to the brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg loaned worth about US$200 million to a company in Roldugin's network. The leaked documents do not show whether they were repaid. Shortly before the loan was granted, Arkady Rotenberg's company had been awarded the tender for the South Stream pipeline project, worth billions. Asked about his companies, Rodulgin said \\"I have to take a look and find out what I can say and what I can't\\", and that financial matters are \\"delicate\\". Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Western reporting of the Panama Papers \\"Putinophobia\\", said that they target Putin and are part of a conspiracy against Russia orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States Department of State and others. Putin denied \\"any element of corruption\\", and said his opponents are trying to destabilize Russia. Putin also said: \\"WikiLeaks has showed us that official people and official organs of the US are behind this.\\"\\"Putin dismisses Panama Papers as an attempt to destabilise Russia \\". The Guardian. April 7, 2016. On 2016's annual Direct Line with Vladimir Putin, he called the leaked documents \\"reliable\\" but confined his comments to Roldugin, saying that Western media did not understand that the musician has spent all his off-shore income on \\"musical instruments for Russia\\". Putin also said Goldman Sachs owned shares in the parent company of S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, which is in fact owned by a Munich family and a German media group. The Kremlin apologized for this \\"mistake\\". Initially, mainstream Russian media almost entirely ignored the leak. Neither state-owned Channel 1 and Rossiya 1, nor privately owned REN-TV and NTV, mentioned the story on April 4, the day the story broke. The minimal coverage of the story ran in the middle of the night on Vesti TV and was in relation to Lionel Messi and Michel Platini. An exception was the Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, described as \\"the ICIJ's Russian partner\\", which reported on the story both in hard copy and online.\\"Panama Papers: How Moscow and Beijing reported Panama\\" . BBC News. April 4, 2016. By the end of April OCCRP published analysis of further batch of the leaked documents demonstrating a cash flow to the Rodulgin accounts from the 2007 tax theft of $230m by Moscow tax inspectors uncovered and reported by Sergei Magnitsky.  Spain  Jos√© Manuel Soria, Minister of Industry of Spain, resigned on April 15, 2016. On April 15, 2016, Jos√© Manuel Soria was forced to leave his post as acting Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism when the Panama Papers revealed that he and his family had maintained several offshore societies on tax havens during the previous decades. Soria initially denied this, but reports kept leaking that contradicted him. On April 14, a company came to light that he had owned on Jersey until 2002, while mayor of Las Palmas. Soria was put in a critical political position as a result of his confusing and changing explanations on the issue, and resigned the next day. He is not the only prominent Spanish politician who had offshore companies. Former IMF president Rodrigo Rato, vice-president in the conservative government of prime minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, had more than ‚Ç¨3.6 million in two offshore companies. He has been charged by Spain with alleged tax offenses, money laundering and corruption among individuals in other cases of corruption. Micaela Domecq-Sol√≠s, the wife of Miguel Arias Ca√±ete, currently the European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy and formerly the EU Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, also opened shell societies. The Spanish Royal Family is also involved in this tax scandal: Princess Pilar of Borb√≥n, Duchess of Badajoz, sister of former King Juan Carlos I and aunt of the current King, Felipe VI, had an offshore corporation for 40 years, until the abdication of her brother. She assembled a company called Delantera Financiera, in 1974, and was its president and administrator. She initially denied this when her name appeared in the Panama Papers. Her husband, who died in 1991, was secretary-general of the corporation. His son, Bruno Gomez- Acebes, is treasurer and manager of this company. The name of , the count of Ripalda and the brother of Jaime de Marichalar, the former husband of the king's daughter, Elena de Borb√≥n, also appears. Moreover, in a huge corruption scandal involving the royal house, I√±aki Urdangarin and his business associate in the N√≥os foundation, were advised by Mossack Fonseca to move funds. Two great-grandchildren of the dictator Francisco Franco, Francisco and Juan Jos√© Franco Suelves set up registered societies in the British Virgin Islands through Mossack Fonseca. Juan Jos√© Franco opened Malini Investments in 1997, being director in 2012 and closed in 2013. He told the newspaper El Confidencial he was \\"absolutely ignorant\\". Francisco Franco Suelves, his older brother, also opened Vamfield Alliance Limited in 1997 as a director. , son of Jordi Pujol, former President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, granted the diversion of a commission of 6.8 million euros from the sale of an office to an opaque society, which repaid, with another offshore company, about 5 million more. His Pujol family, parents and children, are charged with several counts of tax fraud and corruption, among other crimes. The current wife of former prime minister of Spain Felipe Gonz√°lez, Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Vaquero, opened an account in Switzerland for Carmingo Ltd in 2004 in the tax haven of Niue, an island in the South Pacific. The lawyer C√°ndido Conde-Pumpido Jr., son of former General Prosecutor of Spain and magistrate of the Supreme Court of Spain, C√°ndido Conde-Pumpido, asked to open a Mossack Fonseca offshore company in 2008, though the transaction wasn't completed. He had intended the offshore company to be an intermediary in a project to build a skyscraper in the capital of Panama, not to hide money. Francisco Paesa, an important spy for the CNI, while working for the Ministry of Interior, opened an offshore account after faking his death in 1998. Top bankers and Spanish businessmen used this firm to open accounts and companies: Miguel Blesa, president of Caja Madrid, tried in Spanish courts for numerous cases of corruption, Jesus Barderas, a businessman close to ex-prime minister Felipe Gonz√°lez, children of the lawyer Javier de la Rosa, who also is linked to corruption cases, Carlos Ortega, CEO of Pepe Jeans, and families with major hotel chains such as the Riu (RIU Hotels & Resorts), the Escarrer (Meli√° Hotels International) and the Martin√≥n (Group Martin√≥n). Art collectors Marina Ruiz-Picasso and Borja Thyssen have Mossack Fonseca companies. Thyssen's lawyer said his company was fully declared to tax authorities and Ruiz-Picasso declined comment. Other celebrities involved include Spanish director Pedro Almod√≥var, who won an Oscar in 2003 for Habla con ella and with his brother Agustin created a company in 1991 called Glen Valley in the British Virgin Islands. Agustin responded saying he closed the company in 1994 and it paid all of its taxes. Showbiz personality Carmen Lomana said that after the death of her husband, owner of the offshore company, she took care of it but without knowing anything at all about the business or about tax. Bert√≠n Osborne, host and Spanish singer, and the famous actor Imanol Arias, protagonist of one of the longest and most important series of the Spanish television, Cu√©ntame c√≥mo pas√≥, were named. Osborne said his account was legal and that he used it as recommended, to save money. He is also involved in a scandal over fraud to the Treasury, with actress and fellow protagonist on the series, Ana Duato. Juan Luis Cebri√°n, journalist, co-founder of El Pa√≠s, and CEO of Prisa, a Spanish media conglomerate, owns 2% of Star Petroleum, a related oil corporation with tax havens. After being named, he decided to take legal action against La Sexta, who revealed his involvement in this scandal. The former president of FC Barcelona, Josep Llu√≠s N√∫√±ez, the current vicepresident, Carles Vilarrub√≠, and Eduardo Fernando de Blas, the vicepresident of Real Madrid, had offshore companies with Mossack Fonseca.  Sweden  The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) said on April 4, 2016, it would investigate the actions of Nordea, one of the largest financial institutions in the Nordic countries, after the Panama Papers revealed the bank's Luxembourg office had helped to set up nearly 400 offshore companies for its clients between 2004 and 2014 in Panama and the British Virgin Islands for their customers. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) has said that \\"serious deficiencies\\" exist in how Nordea monitors for money laundering, and had given the bank two warnings. In 2015 Nordea had to pay the largest possible fine‚Äîover five million EUR. In 2012 Nordea asked Mossack Fonseca to change documents retroactively so that three Danish customers' power of attorney documents would appear to have been in force since 2010. The director for Nordea Private Banking, Thorben Sanders, has admitted that before 2009 Nordea did not screen for tax evaders: \\"In the end of 2009 we decided that our bank shall not be a means of tax evasion,\\" said Sanders. Other Swedish banks are also present in the documents, but Nordea occurs 10,902 times and the next most frequently mentioned bank only occurs 764 times. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) later said that they would also investigate the other three big banks in Sweden: Handelsbanken, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) and Swedbank. Nordea cut all ties with Mossack Fonseca following an interview with Nordea CEO Casper von Koskull on SVT on April 4. In response to the leaks, Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven said he is very critical of Nordea's conduct and role, and Minister of Finance Magdalena Andersson characterized the bank's conduct as \\"totally unacceptable\\".  Switzerland  On April 6, the federal police searched UEFA headquarters in Nyon as part of a \\"criminal mismanagement\\" probe into a Champions League television rights deal signed by FIFA's new president Gianni Infantino. The same day, Geneva's attorney general opened several procedures in reaction to a report about misconduct by Swiss lawyers and trustees. On April 8, a few hours after the publication of a new series of articles focusing on art hidden behind offshore companies, a prosecutor sequestered a Modigliani worth some $25 million at Geneva Freeport. Litigation in New York alleged the painting had been stolen by Nazis during World War II; the defendants said they did not own it, but the leaked documents show that they control International Art Center, a shell company registered in Panama which does own it. Yves Bouvier and Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, in litigation over art pricing, both have Mossack Fonseca companies. The leaked papers also shed light on the ownership of shell companies in protracted litigation in Lausanne over ownership of artwork from the Gstaad chalet of the late Greek shipping tycoon Basil Goulandris. On April 11, another investigation into the abuse of the name of charities like Red Cross or WWF was launched. Swiss-based Diacore is a Mossack Fonseca client, and has approximately thirty companies through them. Diacore is run by Daniel Steinmetz, but until recently his brother Beny Steinmetz had a power of attorney for the company. Diacore is part of the Steinmetz Group.  Ukraine  Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko When Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko took office in 2014, a popular uprising had just toppled his predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych. Poroshenko pledged to sell his candy business (Roshen) if elected, but leaked documents indicate that on August 21, 2014 he instead had Mossack Fonseca set up offshore holding company Prime Asset Partners Ltd in the British Virgin Islands and moved his company there, roughly two months after the election. The move had the potential to save him millions of dollars on his Ukrainian taxes. Records in Cyprus show him as the firm's only shareholder. Some legal experts say the explanation may be sound; however this isn't making a difference to Ukrainian media making the point that Poroshenko opened his offshore account in August 2014 as Ukrainian soldiers were being massacred by the Russians in Ilovaisk. The Panama Papers report may also have figured in the defeat of a trade deal with the Netherlands in a referendum there on April 6. Anti-corruption group Transparency International believes that the \\"creation of businesses while serving as president is a direct violation of the constitution\\". Also, journalists from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project believe that with the move Poroshenko committed two other illegalities, starting a new business while in office and failing afterwards to report it on his disclosure statements. Poroshenko denied any wrongdoing and a spokesman said the offshore company had no active assets and was a legitimate corporate restructure aimed at helping to sell Poroshenko's Roshen group. Analysts in Ukraine responded that the secretive way Poroshenko set up these accounts was certain to undermine trust in him, his party and Ukraine itself. The news about Poroshenko's offshore business came as his government campaigned against offshore companies. Oleh Lyashko, leader of the Radical Party, urged lawmakers to begin impeachment proceedings, and even some of his allies backed calls for a parliamentary commission to investigate the allegations. In the Ukrainian Parliament, relations between the Poroshenko bloc and the People's Front party of Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had over previous months already soured, with mutual accusations of corruption. The Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk also announced he would resign over Panama Papers leaks.  United Kingdom  The then British prime minister David Cameron. Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition, called for an immediate independent investigation into the tax affairs of Cameron's family. According to The Guardian, \\"More than ¬£170bn of UK property is now held overseas. ... Nearly one in 10 of the 31,000 tax haven companies that own British property are linked to Mossack Fonseca.\\" Included among the Panama Paper documents are the names of six members of the House of Lords, several of whom have been donors to Cameron's Conservative Party, as well as other Conservative donors. These include: * Anthony Bamford: ¬£4 million in Conservative Party donations, made a Conservative life peer in 2013; * David Rowland: ¬£3.8 million in Conservative Party donations, former party treasurer; * Fleming Family & Partners: Over ¬£400,000 in Conservative Party donations, including direct donations to David Cameron; * Juniper Equities Trading: ¬£250,000 loan to the Conservative Party from an offshore fund with an opaque ownership structure; * Tony Buckingham: ¬£100,000 donation to the Conservative Party; * Lord Ashcroft: the man who published \\"piggate\\" allegations about Cameron; * Baroness Pamela Sharples (via her Bahamas company Nunswell Investments Limited): made a life peer in 1973; * Former MP Michael Mates via his company Haylandale: claimed his company \\"never had any real value\\" and registered interests with Parliament. As the United Kingdom still exercises varying degrees of control over British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies which make up a large number of the many tax havens and \\"secrecy jurisdictions\\" that exist, pressure mounted on Prime Minister David Cameron to make changes. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Panama Papers \\"are shining a light on the constellation of offshore centers in the last remnants of the British Empire, from Gibraltar to the British Virgin Islands (BVI).\\" Of the companies created by Mossack Fonseca which were included in the leaked data, the BVI companies topped the list, with 113,000 of the nearly 215,000 companies that Mossack Fonseca managed or incorporated there. British Overseas Territory Anguilla was 7th on the list. Cameron criticized complex offshore structures in 2013, saying that it is \\"not fair and not right what some [companies] are doing by saying 'I've got lots of sales here in the UK but I'm going to pay a sort of royalty fee to another company that I own in another country that has some special tax dispensation.'\\" He said he would bring up the issue at the G8 summit that year. At the summit, Cameron demanded more transparency, arguing that it would be better for business. In 2014, Cameron asked all Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies to set up an open register of firms and individuals with investments registered in their jurisdictions, but by the time of the Panama Papers leak in April 2016, only Montserrat and Gibraltar had agreed to do so.s Protesters outside 10 Downing Street call for David Cameron's resignation, April 9, 2016 Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn said \\"The government needs to stop pussyfooting around on tax dodging\\" and called for \\"direct rule\\" to be imposed over British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies that act as tax havens. Former Business Secretary Vince Cable agreed, although former attorney general Dominic Grieve described the proposal as a \\"bit of a nuclear option\\" which would \\"destroy the livelihoods\\" of BVI inhabitants in the finance industry. The Labour Party also said that Cameron's planned \\"anti- corruption\\" summit in May would be \\"a charade\\" if Cameron, as chairman of the summit, did not require representatives of all Crown dependencies and overseas territories to attend. Jennie Granger, a spokeswoman for HMRC, said that the department had received \\"a great deal of information on offshore companies, including in Panama, from a wide range of sources, which is currently the subject of intensive investigation\\". She said HMRC had asked ICIJ to share all its data. Private Eye revealed that Edward Troup, appointed executive chair of HMRC in April 2016, was a former partner with Simmons & Simmons, the London- based legal firm whose clients included the Panama-registered fund created by David Cameron's father, Blairmore Holdings. Papers obtained by the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ reveal Simmons & Simmons' close relationship with running offshore companies and major overseas property owners, including an investment company run on behalf of Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, while Troup was its senior tax partner. = Blairmore Holdings, Inc. = Ian Cameron, the late father of UK Prime Minister David Cameron, ran an offshore fund (Blairmore Holdings, Inc.) through Mossack Fonseca that avoided UK taxes for 30 years. His company moved to Ireland after David Cameron became Prime Minister. On April 6, Cameron admitted that he had owned shares in Blairmore, but said he sold his shares before becoming PM. Prominent politicians criticized the involvement of the Cameron family in the scandal; Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn urged an immediate independent investigation into the tax affairs of Cameron's family as well as tighter laws on UK tax avoidance.

Her skills in performing popular music and jazz enabled her to entertain audiences with either genre or a combination of the two. A review in the trade publication Variety described her as having \\"an easygoing earthiness that glows in the velvet textures of her voice ...\\"  Early years  Haran was born in San Francisco, California, one of eight children in an Irish Catholic family. Her father, James Haran, taught English, film and theater at City College of San Francisco. Her mother encouraged Haran to study dancing and violin, but she eventually turned to singing. In her youth, her favorite singers included Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, and Peggy Lee, and their work influenced her style and choice of material as a professional singer. She was also influenced by Depression-era films that she watched in her youth. Later, they provided material as she wove anecdotes about that period with performances of songs of the time. As a teenager, Haran performed in musicals at the Eureka Theater. While a student at San Francisco State University, she was an English major, which she considered to be a basis for her partiality to lyricists.  Career  In the early- and mid-1970s, Haran performed in local and regional West Coast theatrical productions, including Dangling Desperation or All Strings Attached, Beach Blanket Babylon, The Boys from Syracuse, Company, and Babes in Arms. A newspaper review of a 1975 performance of The Boys from Syracuse noted: \\"Mary-Cleere Haran was excellent in the role of the Courtesan. Her singing is extremely stylish and were she interested in pursuing a nightclub career, she could probably make a considerable splash almost immediately.\\" She also sang at casinos in Nevada and Texas with The New Deal Rhythm Band. She left that group after being asked to perform more in the style of a 1920s-era flapper, although her tastes ran to more sincere music. Then she moved to New York to perform on stage. Her off-Broadway productions included Heebie Jeebies, Manhattan Music, and Swingtime Canteen. On Broadway (billed as Mary-Cleere Haran), she portrayed Ann Collier in The 1940's Radio Hour (1979). Following that performance, she turned her attention to singing in clubs. Debuting in New York cabarets in 1985, Haran was \\"fiercely proud to call herself a cabaret artist\\". She used the intimacy and directness of cabarets to her advantage as she performed not just a selection of songs but a production whose preparation was equivalent to an off-Broadway show. Will Friedwald, in his book A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, commented, \\"Ms. Haran always plays herself in one of her one-woman shows, addressing the audience in her dual role as scholar and interpreter of the Great American Songbook.\\" For example, her 2007 show \\"Mary Cleere Haran Sings Doris Day\\" mixed Haran's vocalization of songs associated with Day with \\"anecdotes, cultural history and her own personal reflections\\" about the singer. Haran did research about each singer and songwriter whose work she performed to find material to supplement his or her featured songs. Her accompaniment usually was no more than a trio of bass, drums, and piano. On television, Haran wrote and co-produced Doris Day: Sentimental Journey on PBS in addition to contributing her efforts to programs about Bing Crosby, Irving Berlin, and Louis Armstrong. She also appeared as torch singer Lee Ann on 100 Centre Street (2002).  Personal life  Haran was married to, and divorced from, director Chris Silva. She had one son with her second husband, Joe Gilford, a director and writer whom she divorced.  Death  On February 3, 2011, Haran was injured when an automobile hit the bicycle that she was riding. She died two days later in Deerfield Beach, Florida, at age 58 from injuries caused by that collision.

Early life  Roe's illustration for his 1903 Popular Science Monthly article, \\"The New West Point\\". Roe was born on September 1, 1843 in his grandfather's mansion on Grand Street. He was educated at Russell Military Academy in New Haven, Connecticut, a preparatory school for young men interested in attending nearby Yale or West Point. After abruptly leaving Russell's, Roe was enrolled at the Newburgh Collegiate Institute, a private boys' school in Newburgh administered by Polish-American M. L. Domanski. During this time, he began writing for the school's magazine,The Acorn. At fifteen, Roe left his schooling to study law at the firm Hasbrouck & Taylor in Newburgh. His uncle, William C. Hasbrouck, supervised his studies. Later in life, he remarked that the law profession was not for him. In 1861, he enlisted in a volunteer company, the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, in response to the outbreak of the Civil War. Though he was elected sergeant, his father was opposed to him engaging in the war and took him to Europe in January 1862. Roe Sr. claimed he would allow his son to continue if the war had not ended within six months. Most of those six months were spent abroad, and the Roes visited England, France, Switzerland and Italy. Roe corresponded with the Newburgh Journal, and letters from his travels abroad were serialized. While traveling, cadetship at West Point was offered. Going through West Point to become a lieutenant was more favorable for than fighting. He received an appointment from the Hon. John Sedgwick and began in 1863, graduating in 1867.  Business career  When Roe I was declared a lunatic, his son took the reins on his business ventures and maintained his property. Roe II was appointed overseer of his father's will and finances. William James Roe I died on November 20, 1875. Much of his property and earnings were lost due to financial inexperience. Seeking to regain the losses, Roe became president of the Hydrogen Company of New York and New Jersey in 1881. He had moved his family to Montclair, New Jersey in 1880. The company sought to perfect a process that made iron parts insusceptible to rust. A building was erected at West 18th Street in Manhattan and more commercial outlets were realized. None of these came to fruition, as the process was never improved to the satisfaction of a market. The company collapsed immediately after this failure.  Writing career  Roe had always found a hobby in writing creatively and for the press. After he regained part of his fortune, he turned to writing entertaining short stories, philosophical works and poetry. His earliest novels were The Model Wife, White Feathers and Cut: A Story of West Point. At the time of its publication, Cut was regarded as the most accurate depictions of cadet life at West Point, being based heavily on Roe‚Äôs own experiences. He soon after began planning new novels under the pen names Hudor Genone and G. I. Cervus. One of his most popular novels was Inquierendo Island, published in 1886 by G. P. Putnam‚Äôs Sons, the Twentieth Century Company and Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company. It aroused much debate over its religious satire elements in the United States and abroad. In Inquierendo Island, he ‚Äúdramatized in unmistakable terms his negative feelings about Christianity. The protagonist, shipwrecked on the eponymous mid-Atlantic Island, discovers that its inhabitants have constructed a topsy-turvy Religion, which they follow with pious zeal, out of their ancestors' bad memories of their own shipwreck and out of idolatry directed towards the arithmetic text which is the only printed book to have survived; they worship at the church of Saint Complex Fraction. The book can also be seen to mock the triumphalist arguments that bolster the typical Robinsonade.‚Äù About a year later, Bellona‚Äôs Husband: A Romance was published by J. B. Lippincott & Co.. The novel ‚Äútakes its protagonists via Spaceship ‚Äì powered by a kind of Antigravity device ‚Äì to Mars, where they find a humanlike society distinguished from ours partly by the Martians' insistence that the literal truth must always be told, but mainly by the fact that they live backwards in time, growing constantly younger; this may be the earliest example of the Time in Reverse tale presented in full-fledged narrative form.‚Äù In 1892, The Last Tenet Imposed upon the Khan of Thomathoz was published by Charles H. Kerr & Company. Roe's affinity for religious satire continued. The novel describes ‚Äúthe discovery by sixteenth-century missionaries of the Lost World of Thomathoz hidden in the mountains of Asia.‚Äù More compact works such as such as John Morton‚Äôs Morals and Scarlet Gods were novels both published serially in Town & Country, while the esoteric and slightly occult ‚ÄúThe Philosophy of a Divine Man‚Äù was published in The Metaphysical Magazine. For a brief period, Roe had an interest in the occult, becoming interested in hypnotism and divination. He later found these to be dangerous, denouncing Eusapia Palladino in The New York Times.  Personal life  Photograph from a September 1914 interview, announcing his gradual retirement from writing On July 1, 1867, Roe married Mary Stuart Norton at Central Presbyterian Church in Buffalo, New York. Roe was raised Episcopalian at St. George's Church, Newburgh, despite many of his ancestors being Presbyterian. He was integral to the founding of the first Reformed Episcopal church in Newburgh, which he had selected the name for: The Church of the Corner-Stone. Roe had three children: William James III, Anna Lawrence, called \\"Nan\\" or \\"Annie\\" by the family, and Mary Stuart. The William Roe Mansion in Newburgh, where three generations of the family lived. Mary Stuart went on to marry the artist Lee Woodward Zeigler on October 16, 1909,\\"New York, County Marriages, 1847‚Äì1848; 1908‚Äì1936\\".

Both daughters were talented writers, and often wrote using pen names in St. Nicholas Magazine. On November 27, 1920, the family was traveling to the 1920 Army-Navy Football Game at the Polo Grounds in New York City when Anna was killed in an automobile accident. Roe never recovered from her sudden death. That winter, he began to lose interest in life and his writing. He passed away on April 3 at 77. He requested that his funeral not exceed $250 in costs. It was held on the afternoon of April 5, after which he was buried in St. George's Cemetery.

Regina was selected because Saskatchewan was centrally located in Western Canada and was the third most populous province in Canada. The plant has 1,0000 jobs.  History  The Regina Plant was announced on and commenced operations six month after it was announced on . The plant produced Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles, and Pontiacs. In October 1929, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred causing car sales to decrease sharply. The plant laid off some workers in early 1930. By August 1930, all production at the plant was stopped. In March 1931, the plant reopened, but production once again stopped a few months later. In 1937, the plant reopened after General Motors spent (almost half the original cost of the plant, ) on renovations. The reopened plant had 400 jobs, under half then what it had when it originally opened. The plant also began producing Buicks and Maple Leaf trucks (modified Chevrolet trucks). In 1941, due to World War II, plant was taking over by the Government of Canada, making GM no longer the owner, renamed Regina Industries Limited and was converted to the largest munitions plant in Saskatchewan, primarily focusing on gun carriages and anti- tank guns. In 1943, the plant employed 1,596 people. After the war, the plant was no longer used for vehicle manufacturing as production and distribution techniques changed, making it impractical for General Motors to operate the plant. The plant was used by the Department of National Defence until the mid-1960s. The building was acquired by the Government of Saskatchewan in 1967 and was used by various tenants. On May 3, 2017 the Regina Plant caught fire, causing significant damage to the building. The surrounding areas was blocked off and power was cut to prevent further fire.

Early life and education  McStay was born on 20 May 1917 in Roxburgh, New Zealand. She had Scottish and Irish heritage and grew up in Invercargill in a musical family of six children. Her mother, Mary (n√©e Auld) enjoyed singing Scottish songs. Her father, Hugh William McStay, had no formal musical education but great natural talent that enabled him to play almost any instrument. He died when she was 14. McStay attended Southland Girls' High School. She studied piano from the age of five, first under Mona Rankin and then under May O'Byrne (later May Jones), and gained high marks in piano exams, including the highest marks in the country in Grade Eight and the highest marks in the South Island for her licentiate exam. While still at school, she played in country concerts for local farming communities and in a school orchestra led by Alex Lindsay, later a highly acclaimed professional musician himself. At age 17, she was awarded an Associated Board Scholarship to London. A bequest from a great-uncle and fundraising by the local Invercargill community helped to raise money for her to go, and in 1935, aged 18, she sailed to England to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London. During her studies, she won a number of prizes and awards, including the Challen gold medal, the Walter Macfarren gold medal, and the Janet Duff Greet Prize for a performance of contemporary music.  Professional career  In 1939, with war looming and her studies finished, McStay took up a teaching job at St Swithun's School, Winchester.

She toured England with a small group of Spanish artists under the auspices of the Arts Council of Great Britain. She also played in numerous broadcasts for the BBC. In 1954, she returned to New Zealand where she took up the first of many contracts with the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation and began a series of nationwide tours for the New Zealand Chamber Music Federation (now Chamber Music New Zealand) and the Community Arts Service, playing in venues that ranged from concert halls to people‚Äôs homes. She also carried out a three-month tour of Japan as pianist for English violinist Maurice Clare. Over the following years she played with the Alex Lindsay String Orchestra, the New Zealand Wind Quintet, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO) and visiting conductors such as Karel Anƒçerl and Alceo Galliera. She played with some of the greatest artists from around the world including, among others, violinists Szymon Goldberg, Ruggiero Ricci, Ladislav J√°sek and Henryk Szerying, cellist James Whitehead, trumpet players Gordon Webb and Albert McKinnon and Paul Robeson. She also worked with artists in New Zealand, such as Ruth Pearl and Marie Blaschke.

And also from the other Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, etc. They are a sub group of Indian Americans. In 2020, Telugu language is recognised as one of the official languages of United States, especially for the 2020 United States presidential election.  History  In 2000, Telugu people in the U.S. were numbered around 87,543. By 2014, the number surged to 222,977 and was 415,414 by 2017. The rise in Telugu population is attributed to the increasing representation of South Indian diaspora in technological field. Demographics Telugu people now constitute of one of the largest groups of Indian Americans. The majority of Telugu Americans live in New York City, Long Island, Northern Virginia, Central New Jersey, and Central and Southern California, with smaller but significant populations throughout the country in major metropolitan and micropolitan areas of almost every state. Language The Telugu community in the United States is largely bilingual. Recent study by the US-based Centre for Immigration Studies shows Telugu as the fastest growing language in US which has grown by 86% in the last seven years. Religion  Vast majority is Hindu with significant minorities like Christians and Muslims.  Social issues  Due to the rapidly increasing number of students and workers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in America, Telugu Americans have suffered from hate crimes in America. The most notable of these incidents was the 2017 Olathe, Kansas shooting, in which a white supremacist, Adam Purinton, harassed two Telugu immigrants, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, under the pretense that Kuchibhotla and Madasani were Iranians or illegal immigrants; later shooting them, killing Kuchibhotla and wounding Madasani as well as Ian Grillot, a white American who had come to the defense of Kuchibhotla and Madasani.

It is set in the scenic North Cascades, which is a sub-range of the Cascade Range. The peak is situated midway on the high ridge which connects Forbidden Peak with Boston Peak. The Quien Sabe Glacier lies below its southern cliffs, and the immense Boston Glacier spreads out below the north aspect. Many climbers consider Sharkfin Tower as having some of the best granite in the state of Washington. Two popular established rock climbing routes are the Southeast Ridge (YDS 5) first climbed in August 1947, and the Southeast Face (YDS 5.10), first climbed by Jim Nelson, Jim Martin, Kit Lewis, Bill Liddell, and Dave Bale in September 1990.Selected Climbs in the Cascades, Volume 1, 2nd Ed., Jim Nelson and Peter Potterfield, page 192, The Mountaineers Books, 2003 The first ascent of the Northwest Face was made on July 1, 1968, by Mike Heath, Dan Raish, and Woody Savage. On July 10, 2005, tragedy befell a party of The Mountaineers attempting to climb the tower, resulting in three fatalities and one injured. Surface runoff from Sharkfin Tower drains into the Cascade River and Thunder Creek, both of which are tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Sharkfin Tower is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W., Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Sharkfin Tower from southeast The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Byrne, Peter Facinelli, Anne Winters, and Tom Segura. The plot follows a group of people who discover a mobile app that correctly tells its users when they are going to die. It was released in the United States on October 25, 2019 by STX Entertainment, receiving negative reviews from critics and grossing $48 million worldwide. Plot At a party, teenager Courtney is convinced by her friends to download Countdown, an app that seemingly predicts how long a user has left to live. Courtney is startled that it says she only has 3 hours left to live. After avoiding getting into a car with her drunk boyfriend Evan, Courtney receives a notification stating she has broken the \\"user agreement\\". Returning home, she is attacked by an unseen entity and killed as her timer reaches zero. At the same time, Evan crashes and a tree branch goes right through where Courtney would have sat. Quinn Harris, a nurse who works at the hospital where an injured Evan is admitted, suffers frequent sexual harassment by her boss, Dr. Sullivan, but fears speaking out as she is new. Evan tells her about Courtney and his suspicions about the app. He also reveals it states that he will die at the time he is due to go into surgery. Quinn is dismissive of his claims but eventually downloads it. She is horrified to learn it says she has only three days left. Evan skips his surgery and is informed he has violated the user agreement. He is killed by a demonic version of Courtney. Quinn cancels a plan to go out with her younger sister Jordan and their father before being informed she has broken the user agreement. She researches the app, learning about Courtney and that similar things have happened to other app users, but they are regarded as fake. Panicked, she buys a new phone but discovers the Countdown app has installed itself on it. After being attacked by a demonic figure, she encounters Matt, whose Countdown states he will die a few hours before Quinn. Quinn learns Sullivan has tricked the staff into thinking she sexually harassed him: as a result, she is suspended. Matt is attacked by the entity taking the form of his deceased brother. They look at the user agreement, which states the agreement is broken if the user tries to change their fate: Quinn's trip with her family and Matt taking a train ride, which they both canceled, would've resulted in their original deaths. They hack into the app and learn Jordan is due to die right before Quinn. Derek, the phone salesman who helped them hack into the app, adds more years to all three of their life spans. However, Quinn is attacked by the demon and the countdowns revert to their original times. A priest they consulted, Father John, identifies the demon as Ozhin. He theorizes the curse can be broken if someone dies before their countdown ends or lives after. They prepare a warding circle to protect them from the Ozhin's attacks, but Matt is lured out by the Ozhin, who took the form of his younger brother, and killed. Quinn takes injured Jordan to the hospital, where she learns Sullivan also harasses other staff members. Realizing she could kill him and take the 57 years his Countdown predicted for him, she attacks him, but he is saved by Ozhin, who realizes what she is doing. The Ozhin prepares to kill Jordan but Quinn overdoses on drugs, sacrificing herself. Jordan notices Quinn has written something on her arm: \\"Narcan\\". She revives her with Naloxone (\\"Narcan\\") and the duo succeed as the countdown timers stop. Later, Quinn hears news about Sullivan's arrest after more nurses came forward. She discovers an update of the app, Countdown 2.0, has downloaded itself onto her phone. In a mid-credit scene, Derek is on a Tinder date. His Countdown app says he has broken the user agreement. The lights in the restaurant go out before he is attacked by the demon.

The Houthi movement in Yemen claimed responsibility, tying it to events surrounding the Saudi Arabian intervention in the Yemeni Civil War and stating they used ten drones in the attack launched from Yemen, south of the facilities. Saudi Arabian officials said that many more drones and cruise missiles were used for the attack and originated from the north and east, and that they were of Iranian manufacture. The United States and Saudi Arabia have stated that Iran was behind the attack while France, Germany, and the United Kingdom jointly stated Iran bears responsibility for it. Iran has denied any involvement. The situation has exacerbated the Persian Gulf crisis. The attack caused large fires at the processing facility which, according to the Saudi Arabian interior ministry, were put out several hours later. Both facilities were shut down for repairs, cutting Saudi Arabia's oil production by about half ‚Äì representing about 5% of global oil production ‚Äì and causing some destabilization of global financial markets. Saudi Arabia's energy ministry said that the country would tap into its oil reserves to maintain export levels until the facilities return to full capacity by the end of September.  Background  Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, having produced about 12 million barrels of petroleum products per day in 2017. Its proven oil reserves are the second-largest of any country, after Venezuela, and represent about 16% of the world's total. Saudi Aramco, a national oil company owned by the Saudi Arabian government, operates several oil drilling, transport, and production facilities across Saudi Arabia. It is the second- largest oil producer in the world, behind Russia's Rosneft. Aramco says the Abqaiq facility is \\"the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world\\"; it converts sour crude into sweet crude oil by removing sulfur impurities before it is transported to downstream refineries, processing more than 7 million barrels of oil per day, about 7% of global oil production. Bob McNally, a former member of the United States' National Economic Council and National Security Council, told Reuters that \\"a successful attack on Abqaiq would be akin to a massive heart attack for the oil market and global economy\\". The Abqaiq facility had been the site of a failed suicide bombing by Al-Qaeda in 2006. The Khurais oil field, also operated by Aramco, produces about 1.5 million barrels of crude a day, and is estimated to hold up to 20 billion barrels of oil. The Abqaiq oil facility was protected by three Skyguard short-range air defense batteries. Neither the Skyguards nor the other Saudi air-defense weapons ‚Äî MIM-104 Patriot and Shahine (Crotale) ‚Äî are known to have brought down any of the attacking weapons. A CNBC report offered multiple potential explanations, including that Patriot is optimized for interceping \\"high-altitude ballistic missiles\\" and that the Saudi troops operating the defenses \\"have 'low readiness, low competence, and are largely inattentive.'\\" The Guardian newspaper wrote that the defenses \\"would likely have been pointed across the Gulf towards Iran and south towards Yemen, but at least some of the missiles and drones are believed to have struck from the west.\\" On 26 September 2019 Defense News published remarks by the Israeli air and missile defense expert Uzi Rubin, in which he characterized the Abqaiq- Khurais attack as \\"as a kind of 'Pearl Harbor,'‚Äù saying \\"it will spark a lot of solutions‚Äù to the tactic of using unmanned aerial vehicle swarms plus low- altitude, high-speed cruise missiles.  Attack  At around 4:00 a.m. Saudi Arabia Standard Time (UTC+3), Saudi Aramco reported fires at its Abqaiq and Khurais facilities. At the time, about 200 people were in the Khurais facility, according to Aramco officials. The fires were contained a few hours later, according to officials. They said no one died in the incidents, though they left unclear whether anyone was injured in the attack. Saudi Arabia's interior ministry said a few hours later that the fires were \\"a result of ... drones\\". Several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) were reported to be involved. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, stated that 25 drones and missiles were used. Guards at the facilities reportedly tried to bring down the drones with machine gun fire, as captured on surveillance recordings of the facilities. According to Aramco, the drone strikes were in at least two waves; as they were evacuating the Khurais facility and dealing with fires from the first attack, another round of drones struck the facility. Analysis of satellite images of the Abqaiq facility before and after the attacks appear to show 19 individual strikes: 14 that punctured storage tanks, three that disabled oil processing trains, and two more that damaged no equipment. A US interim report found that the attacks originated from the north. According to the NCRI, the attack came from the Omidiyeh military base in Ahvaz.  UAV defense  Saudi Arabia's missile defense system failed to stop the swarm of drones and cruise missiles that struck the oil infrastructure. It is reported that Saudi Arabia has at least one MIM-104 Patriot missile defense system in place at Abqaiq. The missile defense system used was designed to mitigate threats from \\"high flying targets.\\" Unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles fly at an altitude too low to be detected by conventional radar systems. A swarm of drones and cruise missiles coming from multiple directions can confuse and jam radar, as well as overwhelm air defenses. In addition to the Patriot system, at least four shorter-range defense systems were present, yet also failed to detect and mitigate the drone attack. Drones are too difficult to detect by traditional methods; drones are also cheap and extremely accessible. The drones used may have cost around $15,000 or less to build. According to Justin Bronk, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, \\"the cost curve is very favorable to the attacker, meaning Saudi Arabia would have to spend far more than its enemies to protect against additional strike capabilities. As such, there is almost no way the Kingdom can completely defend against such attacks.\\" For more information on counter UAS technology refer to: Counter Drone Systems 2018.  Attackers  In an initial report on 14 September 2019, the Saudi Arabian interior ministry did not identify the source of the attack, but stated they had begun an investigation. A statement from the French Foreign Minister in the early stages after the attack came on 17 September 2019, when he said \\"‚ÄúThe Houthis ... announced that they launched this attack. That lacks credibility,‚Äù but he went on to reference an ongoing international investigation, saying \\"let‚Äôs wait for its results.\\" Hours after the attack, the Houthis said in a statement that they sent ten newly developed drones equipped with propellor and turbojet engines to disable the oil production facilities, and vowed to send more against a wider range of Saudi targets. They said they attacked in retaliation for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, which began in 2015, has killed thousands of Yemeni civilians, and has created a famine and a humanitarian crisis described in 2019 as the worst in the world. A military spokesman for the Houthis said, \\"These attacks are our right, and we promise the Saudi regime that the next operation will be wider and more painful if blockade and aggression continues\\". In the weeks before the Abqaiq‚ÄìKhurais attack, similar drone strikes on Saudi Arabian oil production infrastructure had caused no significant damage. The frequency of Houthi attacks has increased through 2019, with the targets including a Saudi airport. The military spokesman said that the Sept. 14 attacks came after a \\"careful intelligence operation, prior monitoring and cooperation from honorable and freedom-seeking people within the kingdom\\". The use of operatives inside Saudi Arabia would appear to address some of the technical objections about how the Houthis could have struck targets at such a distance.Foreign Policy: What You Need to Know About the Attacks on Saudi Oil Facilities On 16 September, the Houthis warned of more attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, and warned foreigners to leave Saudi oil plants. They had displayed some of their long-range UAVs to the media in July 2019. The range of the drones reportedly can reach distant areas in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Houthis had often used Samad 1 to attack Saudi Arabia. Later, the Houthis used the Quds 1, which is a small ground launched cruise missile that was possibly used in the 12 June 2019 Abha International Airport attack, which occurred in southwestern Saudi Arabia.David D. Kirkpatrick, Christoph Koettl, Allison McCann, Eric Schmitt, Anjali Singhvi and Gus Wezerek: Who Was Behind the Saudi Oil Attack? What the Evidence Shows www.nytimes.com 16 Sept. 2019 A Houthi leader, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, said that they have \\"exploited vulnerabilities in the Saudi defense system\\" and they \\"built their drones in order to avoid these systems, therefore, the Saudi and the Emirati airspace became open to us after their defense system failed to even spot our drones\\". Houthi rebels have previously advocated targeting Aramco. The Rapidan Energy Group and the Center for Strategic and International Studies had both warned that the site of the attack was a vulnerable target. At a press conference on 18 September, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said that they had launched a serious attack and Americans were using fabricated satellite images in an attempt to portray the resulting damage as having had been minimal. He presented aerial photos of the Abqaiq and Khurais facilities, from before the attack, and said that they had been taken by Yemeni drones. He said that the Houthis had launched the attack from three locations. Third-generation Qasif drones were launched from one position, Samad-3 drones from a second position, and from a third position they had launched newly-developed drones which use cluster heads, capable of dropping four accurate, independently-targeted bombs. He said that they would soon display these newly-developed drones. He stated that they were now capable of manufacturing drones rapidly. Yahya Sarea threatened the United Arab Emirates which is part of the Saudi-led coalition, saying that they have a list of targets inside the UAE among them Dubai and Abu Dhabi. He said if the UAE \\"wants peace to its buildings which are made of glass and can't handle an attack by the Yemeni drones then leave Yemen alone\\". In response, UAE officials told The Telegraph newspaper that an attack by Houthis on tourism and global business hubs, would be an attack on the world. Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated on 19 September that preliminary findings from the investigation appear to rule out the Houthis' involvement and their claim \\"lacks credibility\\", but there would be no definitive conclusion until the international investigation is complete. Officials for the United States had rejected the Houthis' claims, and instead said that Iran was responsible for the attacks. In the months prior, tensions between Iran and the United States created a crisis in the Persian Gulf, coupled with Iran's violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action related to their nuclear program in July 2019. On the day of the attacks, an unnamed senior U.S. official said that Iran, not the Houthis, were behind the attack, which involved some dozen cruise missiles and more than 20 drones.Iran fired cruise missiles in attack on Saudi oil facility: Senior U.S. official , ABC, 15 September 2019 The U.S. said that it was working with Saudi Arabia to help investigate the attack and assure the facilities and energy supplies are secure and stable; US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Iran was behind the attacks. US President Donald Trump initially stopped short of definitively blaming Iran for the attack, saying in an 18 September 2019 Newsweek article that \\"it was 'looking like' Iran was behind the attack.\\" Royal Saudi Air Force Colonel Turki al-Malki, a spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition, issued a statement on 16 September saying that the drones appear to have been based on Iranian drones and that they were unlikely to have been launched from Yemen, counter to the claims of the Houthis. However, al-Malki said the coalition was still trying to determine the origin of the drones. At a press conference on 18 September, al-Malki showed debris of the drones, stating there were 18 drones and 7 missiles used in the attack (25 weapons in total), with the drones being delta wing-style craft of Iranian manufacture. Al-Malki showed surveillance footage that had, according to him, caught the drones traveling southward towards the facilities before the strike. He stated that this ruled out Yemen as a point of origin due to the range they would have had to have travelled. He concluded that this evidence \\"point[s] to Iran\\", and that the attack was \\"unquestionably sponsored by Iran\\". Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami stated in response to this new evidence, \\"These accusations are wholly, seriously and firmly rejected. It's easy to accuse someone without providing any proof.\\" On 17 September 2019, an unnamed senior U.S. official told CBS News that the U.S. had identified the location in Southern Iran from which they believe the drones and cruise missiles were launched, while two U.S. Department of Defense officials told NPR that they had detected Iran preparing drone flights at multiple launch sites in Iran before the attack. Saudi Arabia has not reached the same conclusion that Iran was the staging ground for the attacks, becoming increasingly confident but not totally convinced, with the United States due to share more intelligence with Saudi Arabia. The United States stated it would provide evidence at the 2019 United Nations General Assembly that the attack involved cruise missiles from Iran. For example, the United States has stated it has \\"circumstantial evidence\\" that Iran launched the strike from its own soil in the form of satellite imagery which shows Iran readying drones and missiles at launch sites in Iran before Saudi oil facilities were attacked. Late on 18 September, a U.S. official speaking to CBS News said that Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei had signed off on the attacks but only on the assurance that the method of the attack would allow Iran to deny involvement. Coupled with the Saudi evidence, the U.S. official stated that some of the attacks were launched from the Iranian Ahvaz Air Force Base, about from the targets, and flew through Kuwaiti air space. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, who had been trying to calm relations between the United States and Iran, made statements reported on 17 and 18 September 2019 to the effect that they would conduct an investigation prior to announcing conclusions. On 23 September, while meeting at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement \\"It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\\" The three leaders committed to continuing their investigation on the attack and urged Iran to alter their course to avoid elevating further hostilities in the areas. Iran has denied these statements and said that they were \\"blind, incomprehensible and meaningless\\" and warned the U.S. that it was \\"ready for fully-fledged war\\" with them should there be retaliation against Iran. Instead, Iran stated that the Houthis (whom they reportedly support in the Yemeni Civil War) were responsible for the attack. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has stated that \\"Yemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defence‚Ä¶ the attacks were a reciprocal response to aggression against Yemen for years.\\" The Iranian Ministry of Defence has also rejected the statements about Iranian involvement and said, \\"the issue is very clear: there has been a conflict between two countries (Yemen and Saudi Arabia)\\".Iran‚Äôs Rouhani blames US, Saudi for conflict in region 18 September 2019, CNBC, accessed 19 September 2019 In December 2019, the UN said that its investigation was not able to confirm the Saudi official claim that the weapons used in the attack are of Iranian origin. According to a confidential report by U.N. sanctions monitors seen by Reuters said that \\"despite their claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces did not launch the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September 2019.\\" According to a report by the Middle East Eye, an anonymous Iraqi intelligence official said the attacks were launched from Southern Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces bases in retaliation to Israeli drone strikes on the Iraqi forces in August that were reportedly funded by Saudi Arabia. A CBS correspondent stated that the damage at the Abqaiq facilities reportedly was on the western-northwestern portions, which would have been difficult for the Houthis, located to the southwest, to have hit with drones. The BBC reported that satellite images showed damage on the western side of Abqaiq. The office of the Prime Minister of Iraq denied that its territory was used to carry out the attacks and vowed to act \\"decisively\\" against anyone using Iraqi territory to attack other countries. The U.S. has also stated that Iraqi territory was not used.  Aftermath  = Market impacts = Impact of the attack on Brent Crude prices (top right, blue) Saudi Arabian officials stated that the attacks forced the shutdown of the facilities, cutting the country's oil production from 9.8 to about 4.1 million barrels of oil a day, losing 5.7 million barrels of oil a day or about 5% of global production. Initially, spokespeople stated that the plants were expected to return to their nominal capacity by 16 September 2019, and would use reserve oil to make up for the shortfall. However, other officials for the Saudi government estimated the time to restore full production would be \\"weeks, not days\\". The day after the attack, the Saudi stock market fell 2.3% in Sunday trading on 15 September. Commodities and stock markets as well as other financial indicators jumped on worldwide market openings on Monday, 16 September. Brent Crude oil futures prices surged almost 20 percent, the largest surge in the commodity's price since the 1990 Invasion of Kuwait. Other markets also saw impacts from concerns on the oil supply, including U.S. gasoline and heating oil, and the gold market. Impact to the U.S., which had doubled its oil production in the last decade and was now the world's largest producer, was expected to be immaterial. By Tuesday, 17 September, Saudi Arabian officials from the energy ministry stated that the repairs to the Abqaiq facility will be much faster than originally anticipated. The Abqaiq facility was operating at 2 million barrels per day within 48 hours of the attack. The energy ministry said full production could be restored within two to three weeks, by the end of September. Further, the nation planned no reduction of current oil exports, and will use reserve storage to maintain the current levels. These announcements were seen to help calm markets, as oil market prices and other financial indicators dropped during trading on 17 September from the spike the previous day, though still remained at elevated levels which are expected to have impacts on prices across the globe. To expedite repairs, Aramco shipped in equipment from the United States and Europe. The state-owned Saudi Aramco had been in the initial stages of planning its initial public offering (IPO) of about 5% of the company ownership of the estimated valuation of the company over the next few years. This IPO was originally to have started in 2018 but there were concerns about its finances and corporate structure. Industry analysts said that the September 2019 attacks will further delay this IPO until new concerns related to security against terrorism attacks and the ability to restore production after such an incident are proven, as well as the impact on the price of oil. Saudi Aramco later stated that recovery from the attack is not going to be as fast as initially expected, putting the IPO at risk of further delay. Ultimately, the IPO was launched in December 2019, with 1.5% of the company put to public trading on the Tadawul exchange; it became the largest IPO ever at raised, and valuing the company at , making it the largest listed company at launch. On 27 September, Bloomberg News reported that while production capacity and exports implied that the industry was almost back to normal, that view may be overly simplistic, with output 1.8 million barrels a day below the pre-attack level and capacity reported to be only 700,000 barrels below the Kingdom's maximum. Until further repairs and adjustments, customers may be asked to accept heavier oil than the grades originally purchased. = Domestic reactions = The Saudi King, Salman bin Abdulaziz, issued a statement on 17 September, calling the attack a \\"vandalism and coward attack\\" that threatens international security and global energy supplies and said the kingdom is able to respond to these attacks. The king also said the attack comes after a series of attacks against the kingdom. = International reactions = The attacks raised concern over political stability in the Middle East, coupled with the US' stance that the attacks may have originated from Iran. The United States is a close ally of Saudi Arabia, while its relationship with Iran has been strained in 2019 as part of the overall Persian Gulf crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump authorised the release of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help stabilize energy prices in the US. Trump further stated that the U.S. is no longer dependent on oil from the Middle East. Trump condemned the attack and stated on Twitter on 15 September that the U.S. military is \\"locked and loaded\\" but is waiting to hear from the Saudis as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, \\"and under what terms we would proceed\\". In the days that followed, Trump stated that he did not promise to protect the Saudis, but will have to sit with them and \\"work something out\\". On 20 September, Trump issued a new round of economic sanctions against Iran, targeting the Central Bank of Iran and the National Development Fund of Iran, preventing them from purchasing American dollars; these sanctions had been established earlier but had been previously lifted after Iran had agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The sanctions are aimed to prevent Iran from having the funds to support future strikes. On 15 September 2019, Reuters reported on remarks by international organizations by stating \\"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday‚Äôs attacks and called on all parties to exercise restraint and prevent any escalation. The European Union warned the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, and several nations urged restraint.\\" Russian president Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked about the U.S. statements that Iran was behind drone strikes, said: \\"We have a negative attitude towards rising tensions in the region and call for all countries in the region and outside of it to avoid any hasty steps or conclusions which may deepen destabilisation.\\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, said in remarks quoted 16 September 2019 that while there is no \\"conclusive investigation\\", it is irresponsible to blame anyone for the attack, and added \\"we call on relevant parties avoid taking actions that bring about an escalation in regional tensions\\". Other nations called for waiting for results from investigations before stating who was behind the attack. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said on 17 September 2019: \\"We have to look at how the conflict in Yemen started. This country was completely destroyed ‚Äì who caused it?\\" That same day, Japan's defence minister said his country has not seen any intelligence showing Iranian involvement in the attacks. \\"We are not aware of any information that points to Iran,\\" Defence Minister Tar≈ç K≈çno told reporters at a briefing. \\"We believe the Houthis carried out the attack based on the statement claiming responsibility.\\" Also on 17 September 2019, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said the Trump administration ‚Äúcan‚Äôt say definitively‚Äù that Iran was behind the attack. As of 18 September 2019, the United Arab Emirates had not yet attributed responsibility. Several international bodies and nations condemned the attack. The UN Secretary General condemned the attacks on Saudi Arabia, claimed by the Houthis, and UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths said the attack \\"carries the risk of dragging Yemen into a regional conflagration\\" and that \\"there is 'no time to waste' in ending four years of fighting between Houthi rebels and the internationally-recognized Government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, which has pushed the country to the brink of famine.\\"United Nations: Attack on Saudi facilities risks dragging Yemen into ‚Äòregional conflagration‚Äô 16 September 2019 News, UN, accessed 17 September 2019Reuters: U.N. chief condemns Saudi attacks, calls for restraint 15 September 2019 Reuters, accessed 17 September 2019 Arab League in a statement by the General Secretariat on 14 September, strongly condemned the drone attacks and termed the attacks as \\"serious escalations\\" and called for preserving security of the country. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg \\"strongly condemned\\" the attacks and said Iran was \\"supporting different terrorist groups and being responsible for destabilising the whole region.\\" In South Korea, the National Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo denounced drone attacks on oil facilities as \\"a reckless act\\" that harms global security and stability. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to strengthen partnerships between the two countries to fight against the terrorist attacks. During the Houthi \\"21 September revolution anniversary\\", the Houthi leader Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, offered to halt all attacks on Saudi Arabia. He said that Saudi Arabia should in return end its war in Yemen. The Houthis also warned that if Saudi Arabia refused their peace offer the next attacks will be more painful. The UN Yemen envoy, praised the Houthi announcement and said it could send a \\"powerful message of the will to end the war\\". = Related security issues = On 15 September 2019, the Cabinet of Kuwait said it was probing the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia, and other countries, after the attacks. Kuwait has also increased its security as a result of the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to sell Saudi Arabia the advanced S-400 missile system so it could use it against air attacks instead of continuing to use the Raytheon Patriot missile system. However, Putin made this offer beside a chuckling Iranian President Rouhani in what was described as a ‚Äúsublime bit of political trolling‚Äú. By 11 October 2019, the United States had sent 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia in response to the attack, which U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated was to address \\"threats in the region\\" while protecting Saudi Arabia from \\"Iranian aggression\\". Secretive cyberattacks on Tehran internet capabilities followed the event and according to Iranian sources, a rocket attack on Iranian shipping in the Red Sea.Reuters News. (16 October 2019). \\"U.S. carried out secret cyber strike on Iran in wake of Saudi oil attack - report\\". Jerusalem Post website Retrieved 14 January 2020. Uzi Rubin, a prominent Israeli military expert, described the attack as one of the most audacious military surprises ever and a landmark event that bolstered Iran's prestige domestically and internationally in defiance of the US sanctions.

His only friends are his sister Meridith and another scientist called Courtney. On his way to meet his sister he is captured by his uber driver who claims to be his future self and warns him against pursuing his research. James is skeptical of his claims and only becomes more convinced by the potential success of his work, and learns that his research supervisor Dr. Rowley will soon have access to a particle accelerator that he needs to prove his theories. Future James \\"Jimmy\\" tries to warn James that his obsession will ruin his life, and tries to convince James to live more in the moment and warns him of the things he will regret not doing, and even teaches him to meditate. Meredith is trying to get James to deal with the death of their parents fifteen years ago and thinks it is time to finally spread their ashes. Courtney is planning to leave to work at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. Encouraged by Jimmy, James tries to change, but is still determined to pursue his research. Jimmy explains that the time travel only allows him to go back in time and that he must then patiently live out the time in isolation to return to his present. Jimmy says that if James had really changed he wouldn't still be there. James admits to his feelings for Courtney and asks her out on a date, but when she gives him inspiration for his research he is distracted and ruins the moment. He is unable to reconcile with Courtney and she gets ready to leave for Switzerland. James becomes more determined to pursue his research and Dr. Rowley is about to announce her commitment to their new research project. Increasingly desperate Jimmy shoots her through the hand with a spear gun and hunts her through the lab. Instead of attending the big announcement James has gone to the lake to meditate. As James finally realizes he needs to change and before Jimmy can kill Dr. Rowley he fades away to dust. James sits in a caf√© with a puppy on his lap. Courtney joins him and eats a croissant and says \\"I can't believe you're here\\". The other patrons in the caf√© are revealed to be all different versions of James, Courtney, and the dog, from different stages in time.

The imperfections in the cornea are recorded and is then corrected with the help of laser.  Effectiveness  = Quality of Vision = Contoura Vision has resulted in patients vision better than 6/6 (or 20/20, the standardized normal vision) in multiple patients who were a part of evaluation by US FDA trials in attempt to validate the technology. Contoura Vision is the only technology where consistent success beyond 20/20 vision has been achieved in the majority of patients. More than 40% of the patients that were evaluated were able to read one additional line on the visual acuity chart than that of a patient with 20/20 vision. Additionally, 13.5% could read two additional lines on the visual acuity chart. Fewer visual disturbances such as glare, halos, ghost images, difficulty in night time driving and reading were also reported by many patients.

The first detention centre in the state had come up in 2008 under orders of the Gauhati High Court. Currently six immigration detention centres have been set up in Assam, all inside jails, in various districts of the state. A total of ten centres are planned to be built in Assam. There are many in-construction or proposed detention centres to be constructed following the exclusion of people from the final National Register of Citizens of India. In 2014, the Centre had told all the states to set up at least one detention centre for illegal immigrants so as not to mix them up with jail inmates. According to a ruling by the Supreme Court, illegal immigrants can be held for three years at such facilities, after which they are eligible for bail. The detention centers are commissioned as a place to house erstwhile residents who were excluded in NRC and finally declared illegal immigrants by the foreign tribunals of Assam. More than 19 lakh people have not been included into the list of citizens created to identify the illegal immigrants in Assam. These people need to prove their citizenship failing which they may be moved to these centres.  History  The first detention centre in Assam had come up in 2008 under orders of the Gauhati High Court. They were first intended as a location for \\"short-term detention of undocumented immigrants, refugees and people awaiting trial before a Foreigner‚Äôs Tribunals\\". But now they are \\"synonymous with endless captivity.\\" In 2011 the Assam government, when Congress was in power both at the Centre and in the state, had set up three detention camps with hundreds of illegal immigrants. In 2018, Rs 46 crore was sanctioned for a detention camp by the Narendra Modi government. Detainees On 27 November 2019, the Government disclosed that 1043 people were housed in six detention centres in Assam. The existing centres are currently being run from the district jail premises at Dibrugarh, Silchar, Tezpur, Jorhat, Kokrajhar and Goalpara in Assam. On 17 November, The New York Times reported that the government had arrested several hundred people due to the suspicion of them being foreigners. A veteran of the Indian Army was also among those arrested. =Deaths= Trinamul MP Santanu Sen had asked the government in Rajya Sabha on what steps the government had taken to stop the deaths in the detention camps alleging that \\"most of the persons who died, they died out of apprehension\\".

The Sony Clie PEG-NZ90 was a flagship handheld PDA announced by Sony in January 2003. This model was feature-packed, further improving on the capabilities of the NX series models. Like its predecessors, this handheld had a vertical clamshell swivel-screen form factor, and was powered by a 200mhz Intel XScale CPU, running the Palm OS (version 5). The main improvement to this model, were the addition of a Xenon camera flash, and a higher-resolution 2MP built-in CCD camera with both autofocus and a macro mode. This camera was state-of-the-art for the time; capable 2MP cameras with flash were not commonly seen in mobile devices until several years later, such as the Sony Ericsson K750 which was released in 2005. The device was criticised for only featuring 16MB of storage, which was seen as poor value for the high retail price. In Japan, the NZ90U model featured a contactless FeliCa card reader IC. This enabled users to check the balance on an Edy (prepaid-money) card, or a Japan Rail Pass (prepaid travel) card. Over time, a number of these devices have suffered from design defects. In particular, the Sony CCD used had a tenancy to fail over time, due to humidity affecting down the bonding substrate used in the CCD assembly. This failure mode affected many other CCD-based products at the time, including the Clie NX80V PDA, as well as a number of Sony digital camera models. The LCD displays used on this model also had a tendency to be easily damaged.

He was a prolific writer and editor of medical textbooks and encyclopedias, and was the first president of the Endocrine Society. He held professorships at the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and the Medico- Chirurgical College of Philadelphia. Early life Sajous was born on December 13, 1852, on board an American ship that was en route to France. His father, Count Charles Ronstan de Medicis-Jodoigne House of Medici, the head of French-Flemish branch of the Italian House of Medici, died when Charles Eucharist was 2 years old; his mother remarried to James Sajous, and the boy took his stepfather's name. Charles Sajous grew up in France and Mexico before his family settled in the United States in 1861. He studied medicine at the University of California and Jefferson Medical College, graduating from the latter in 1878. Career Sajous completed two years of residency at Philadelphia's Howard Hospital before establishing a local practice in laryngology. In 1881, he was appointed a professor of anatomy and physiology at the Wagner Free Institute of Science, and in 1883, he became a clinical lecturer in laryngology at Jefferson Medical College. Sajous wrote two textbooks on laryngology that were published by the F. A. Davis Company in 1885: Hayfever and Its Successful Treatment by Superficial Organic Alteration of the Nasal Mucous Membrane and Lectures on Diseases of the Nose and Throat. F. A. Davis then chose Sajous as the editor of an annual medical encyclopedia titled The Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences to be published in five volumes per year; the first five volumes were published in 1888. With The Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences, Sajous led a staff of over 100 contributors and published five volumes each year until 1896. Sajous closed his Philadelphia practice in 1891 and moved to Paris to study endocrinology. He returned to Philadelphia in 1897 because he had been made a professor of laryngology and the dean of the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia, and re-opened his practice, now focusing on endocrinology. After The Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences ceased publication in 1896, Sajous and the F. A. Davis Company published a textbook for general practitioners titled Analytic Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine, which had ten editions from 1898 to 1927. His book The Internal Secretions and the Principles of Medicine, one of the first textbooks on endocrinology, was published in two volumes in 1903 and 1907, and summarized the existing literature on normal endocrine function and endocrine pathophysiology. In 1917, Sajous was elected the inaugural president of the Association for the Study of Internal Secretions (now known as the Endocrine Society). The foundation of the association was driven by Henry Harrower, who urged Sajous to be its first leader and the public face of the society. He edited the New York Medical Journal from 1911 to 1919. He was a professor of therapeutics at Temple University from 1910 to 1922, and he was appointed professor of applied endocrinology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1921. Personal life and death Sajous married Emma Christine Bergner in 1884 in Philadelphia. Their son Louis Theodore de Medicis Sajous studied medicine and worked with his father on his endocrinology research. Charles Sajous died on April 27, 1929. He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Recognition Sajous has been called the \\"father of American endocrinology\\" for his contributions to the field. He received numerous international honors: Officier d'Acad√©mie of France, Commander of the Order of the Liberator of Venezuela, Commander of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Spain, and Knight and Officer of the Legion of Honour of France.

There are several sub-genres stemming from this umbrella term including Gengeton, Dabonge, Debe and others. The music is spearheaded by Kenyan youth and most of them are pursuing their careers as music groups opposed to solo careers. The term Odi Pop was coined in 2019 by musician and music scholar Dan 'chizi' Aceda, who is popular for Benga music. He described the naming on The Elephant: > For the sake of definitional simplicity, I am proposing the collective term > ‚ÄúOdi-pop‚Äù to refer to all the sub styles of this new sound. I am aware of > each group having named their style separately e.g Gengetone, Dabonge style > and so on and my definition is not trying to replace that. For me this > musical style is basically pop but with a common sound (hip-hop rap > influence blended with Caribbean phrase and rhyme schemes, all constructed > on an African rhythm base and performed in sing-along rap with heavy > Kiswahili/Sheng inflections). My naming structure is borrowed from K-Pop. >  History  = Origin = Daddy Owen at the Groove Awards Odi pop earliest roots can be traced back to early 2000 Kenyan gospel music which was faintly related to the church. The music at the time was heavily driven by \\"message\\" and \\"meaning\\" which resulted in demand for feel good music. Gospel Superstars like Rufftone and Daddy Owen are considered pioneers in feel good Christian pop music that broke away from the traditional worship style to music that had more rhythm and was more relatable to the youth. In the early 1990s and 2000s, the Kenyan government and church had massive control over what was aired as there was only one state controlled broadcaster. The government clamped down on several secular artists who were considered enemies of state, resulting in the rise of Kenyan gospel music as the style was under an acceptable theme.In 2002, Gidi Gidi Maji Maji released 'Unbwogable' which was adopted by Kenyan politicians; future President Mwai Kibaki and future Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga as the official campaign 2002 election campaign sound track. Ogopa DeeJays, a Kenyan record from the late 1990s was rising to prominence during this period developing music stars like E-sir, K- Rupt, Nameless, Amani, and others. Ogopa Deejays would become one of the most influential record labels in Kenya with their sound called Boomba Music (sometimes referred to as Kapuka). Boomba is one of the foundations of Odi Pop. During the same period, a wave of music called Genge was popularized by hip hop artist Jua Cali and Nonini from Calif Records. The term Genge was coined by their producer Clemo. A paper titled The Poetics of Genge: Jua Cali's Niimbe was presented at the 26th annual MELUS conference and 6th conference of the United States Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies (USACLALS), University of Santa Clara, California. In the following years artists like Mejja, Madtraxx, Jimwat and others played a critical role in shaping the Genge sound. In October 2016, rapper Collo from music group Kleptomaniax released 'Bazokizo' featuring Bruz Newton which is considered a turning point for Odi Pop. The viral nature of the song and numerous airplay brought Odi pop to mainstream media and opened the door for other Odi pop musicians including Timeless Noel and Jabidii. The style has emerged from the Nairobi area mainly in the Eastlands region including Kayole, Dandora, Umoja, Dagoretti, and Rongai.  Rise of Odi Pop  In 2008, President Kibaki signed a deal with the UAE government that brought high speed broadband internet to Kenya by under-sea optic fibre cables. This enabled Kenyan music to develop freely without interference from politicians and the church. Prior to that, a small group of gatekeepers were trusted by the media to select what could be heard while muting that which they frowned upon. The main medium to share the music is video-sharing website YouTube. Researchers ODIPODEV noted the impact of affordable fast internet on Odi Pop: > The fact that the rise of the Internet in Kenya has been driven by the > smartphone has meant that the power of publishing is not just with the > creator but with the creator‚Äôs audience as well. Every single person today > who consumes content online also has the potential to create something new > from the content they‚Äôve just consumed. In the case of ‚ÄòOdi pop‚Äô, the songs > seem to come with a long tail of user-generated content for the artist‚Äôs > audiences to snack on ‚Äì that is, commentary, reactions, reviews or simply > clipping highlights from the content piece, created by the audience > themselves. Kenya is ranked second in Africa after Madagascar for internet speed. = Dance Craze and meme culture = Rapper Collo's collaboration with Bruz Newton, Bazokizo helped popularize Odi pop to the mainstream Kenyan media. The song was nominated for Groove Song of the Year and Groove Afro pop at the 2017 Groove Awards. The dance video was choreographed by Bruz Newton and has over 3 million views on YouTube. More viral videos would follow which helped in popularizing Odi pop in Kenya. On September 15, 2017, Timeless Noel released 'Odi Dance' which was a viral sensation.

Flies from the Tephritidae and Glossinidae are also parasitized. Female Dirhinus wasps target the host flies while they pupate in the soil (after the larval stage is complete); the wasp reaches the pupa by digging in the soil with her horns and an egg is laid on the body of the fly pupa, within its puparium.

First, it responded to claims by various delegations, in particular the delegations of the Netherlands, Slovakia, Austria and Canada, in regards to its nuclear program. Iran stated that its nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, and that they have always observed their legal obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It further stated that more attention should be paid to \\"un- safeguarded and secretive nuclear weapons installations of the Zionist regime.\\" Secondly, it responded to the United Arab Emirates regarding its territorial integrity and the sovereignty of three islands in the Persian Gulf, namely Bu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. These islands are claimed by the United Arab Emirates, and in their General Assembly speech called for their return. Iran, however, considers these islands to be an integral part of Iranian territory. It stated that all actions taken on these islands have been in exercise of its sovereign rights. Serbia The delegation of Serbia used its right of reply to respond to statements made by the Prime Minister of the Albania, Sali Berisha. In his speech before the Assembly, the Prime Minister added his support to the independence of Kosovo from Serbia. He also urged Member States to recognize Kosovo and uphold General Assembly Resolution 49/204, which called for an end to human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, as well as the establishment of democratic institutions in Kosovo. Serbia responded by denouncing Mr. Berisha's attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other United Nations Member States. Serbia also stated that his remarks were deplorable, especially when the legality of Kosovo's secession was being considered by the International Court of Justice. Finally, Serbia stated that, contrary to Mr. Berisha's staements, inter-ethnic tensions in Kosovo have not been reduced, but rather \\"frozen in uneasy expectation.\\" United Arab Emirates The delegation of the United Arab Emirates used its right of reply to respond to statements made in the right of reply of the Islamic Republic of Iran. HH. Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan re-emphasized that the United Arab Emirates considers Bu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb as integral parts of Emirati territory and called upon Iran to engage in unconditional, serious and direct bilateral negotiations in order reach a final outcome of the dispute. He also suggested that, if no resolution could be found, the case be sent to the International Court of Justice for a legal opinion. Albania The delegation of Albania used its right of reply to respond to statements made in the right of reply of Serbia. Albania stated that the Republic of Kosovo was an undeniable reality, and that it would one day finally achieve its independence. While agreeing that the issue was still divisive, the delegation pointed out that the number of countries recognizing Kosovo has only increased. Finally, the delegation stated that it reserves the right to advocate for the independence of Kosovo as a neighboring state that could be possibly affected by any conflicts over the region. = 28 September = Morning session * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Antonella Mularoni * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Marco Hausiku * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Jos√© Antonio Garc√≠a Bela√∫nde * ‚Äì Prime Minister Thein Sein * ‚Äì Secretary for Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa Cantellano * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Khalid Bin Ahmed Bin Mohamed Alkhalifa * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelwaheb Abdallah * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Osman Mohammed Saleh * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Al-Moualem * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Aichatou Mindaoudou * ‚Äì Acting Foreign Minister Ghazi Salahuddin Atabani * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexis Thambwe Mwamba * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Al- Alawi Bin Abdullah * ‚Äì Attorney General Wilfred Elrington * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs P√©ter Bal√°zs * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Lyonpo Ugyen Tshering Afternoon session * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Naha Mint Mouknass * ‚Äì Minister of State Peter Power * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Abubakr Al-Qirbi * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Vladimir Norov * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Oldemiro Marques Baloi * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Edward Nalbandian * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Maxine Pamela Ometa McClean * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Moussa Faki Mahamat * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexandre C√©c√© Loua * ‚Äì Minister of External Affairs Rufus George Bousquet * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Fander Falconi * ‚Äì Minister of External Affairs Assun√ßa√µ Afonso dos Anjos * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Zacarias Albano Da Costa * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Anifah Aman * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Rangin D√¢dfar Spant√¢ * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Ojo Maduekwe * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Patricia Isabel Rodas Baca * ‚Äì Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Pak Kil Yon * ‚Äì Secretary for Foreign Affairs Jo√£o Gomes Cravinho * ‚Äì Chairman Thomas Matussek = 29 September = Morning session * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Peter David * ‚Äì Minister of External Affairs Samuel Abal * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Samuel Santos L√≥pez * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St√∏re * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Hassan Wirajuda * ‚Äì Permanent Representative Roble Olhaye * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Antonio Pedro Monteiro Lima * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Camillo Gonsalves * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Alexandru Cujba * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Anastassis Mitsialis * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Carsten Staur * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Ronald Jean Jumeau * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Kodjo Menan * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Oumar Daou * ‚Äì Chair of the Delegation Charles Thembani Ntwaaggae * ‚Äì Archbishop Celestino Migliore * ‚Äì President of the 64th session of the General Assembly Ali Abdussalam Treki (Closing)  References   External links  * 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly * General Debate of the 64th Session Category:General debates of the United Nations General Assembly Category:2009 in international relations Category:September 2009 events Category:2009 in the United Nations ","title":"General debate of the sixty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly"},{"id":"61775231","text":"How to Survive Being Single (Spanish: C√≥mo sobrevivir soltero), is a Mexican comedy web television series created by Sebasti√°n and Emiliano Zurita, and Marcos Bucay as showrunner for Prime Video, based on certain aspects of Sebastian's life.

She was acknowledged for her community leadership in recovering from fires, in the aftermath of Black Saturday and she is a national expert on leading recovery for communities who have experienced trauma, particularly from bushfire and are seeking different ways to move forward. She works with communities who are recovering from fire, drought, flood and cyclone in various states in Australia including Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. In 2014, she led an international team working with the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal for New Zealand Red Cross.  Black Saturday bushfires and recovery  On 2009 Saturday 7 February the Black Saturday bushfires occurred in Victoria, Australian, and 137 people were killed. In Leadbeater's community, at 4:20 pm fire came, and no warnings were issued. On that day, in her community 27 people died and 85 of the 130 houses were destroyed in a community with a population of 200 people. Her community was involved in the Strathewen Community Renewal Association (SCRA). The SCRA was awarded the national prize, in 2010, for the volunteer section of the Australian Safer Communities Awards. The SCRA was awarded the prize for representing the best practice of ‚Äòbottom- up‚Äô, community-led recovery.  Career and community contributions  Leadbeater is currently director of \\"Disaster Recovery Group Leadbeater\\". She was a community development leader within Murrindindi before and after the Black Saturday bushfires and specialises in recovery from trauma and disaster. Leadbeater‚Äôs research has focussed on community rebuilding after fire, including how there was a desire for people to be resilient, yet due to the fire, all were equally disempowered. She has written a review on resilience following disaster, called the ‚ÄúCommunity Recovery Handbook for the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience‚Äù. Leadbeater quotes ‚ÄúDecisions made by outsiders should not be imposed or forced upon a community; they need to be able to come to their own decisions in their own time. Surely that principle is doubly true of a disaster-affected community.‚Äù Leadbeater has described how healthy strategies from recovery from fire can include psychological recovery as well as building structures. ‚ÄúCoupled with the well- intentioned desire to relieve peoples‚Äô sadness by fixing stuff and building stuff, it‚Äôs not hard to get caught up in a ‚Äòfast equals effective‚Äô bricks and mortar view of recovery‚Äù. She has been involved in community connectedness and how frequency of moving affects disaster recovery, in a project with the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC.

Principal photography took place on 28 February 2019. Rapman's previous work includes the YouTube trilogy Shiro's Story. The film had a budget of ¬£1.3 million and was primarily shot in the London Borough of Enfield after Lewisham and other London boroughs refused to allow shooting, due to instructions from the office of the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, although the director says no one at the mayor's office had actually read the script. Release The film was released on 22 November 2019. Vue Cinemas and Showcase Cinemas in the UK decided to stop screening the film after an outbreak of violence during the film being shown at a cinema in Birmingham. Showcase resumed screenings a few days later. The film was released through Premium VOD in the United States on May 5, 2020, after the limited theatrical release on March 20, 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91%, based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 7.01/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Raw and riveting, Blue Story overcomes its somewhat prosaic story with powerful performances and an impressive clarity of purpose.\\" Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave the film 3/5 and called it \\"An assured and capably performed morality play.\\" BBC Films say the film \\"powerfully depicts the futility of gang violence\\". =Awards and recognition= The film was short-listed alongside nine other films by British Academy of Film and Television Arts for the category of outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer but did not make it in the final nominations.

Birmingham machete incident  On 23 November 2019, The Independent reported that during a screening of Blue Story at Star City in Birmingham, England, police were attacked by a group armed with machetes. Police arrested five teenagers. Families were watching Frozen II when the disorder broke out, sparking an evacuation of the Star City complex, with police stating up to 100 teenagers were involved in the major disorder. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police stated that \\"Dozens of officers were sent to the complex after a 999 call just after 5.30pm reporting a group of youths with machetes. Two machetes were seized during the trouble, which saw pockets of fighting and seven police officers left with minor injuries as they dealt with the crowds in and around the cinema.\\" On 24 November 2019, West Midlands Police reported that a sixth teenager had been added to those arrested, which had included a female aged 13, a male and female both aged 14 and a 19-year-old man. Following the disorder at Star City, the Vue Cinemas chain cancelled all screenings of Blue Story. A statement from Vue said that during the first 24 hours of the film more than 25 significant incidents were reported and escalated to senior management in 16 separate cinemas. Cinema chain Showcase subsequently also ceased showing the film, but the Odeon and Cineworld chains continued to screen it. The ban by Showcase and Vue was labelled as racist by some people on social media, with Showcase later reversing their decision. The film's director Rapman also questioned the reasons behind the ban. Vue also said they would re-start showings, with increased security.

Later on, he allegedly turned into a useful source of information for Georgian intelligence by identifying Russian spies and jihadists operating on domestic and foreign soil through a connection with Georgian intelligence agents. Khangoshvili continued to be considered a terrorist by Russian security service, the FSB and wanted in Russia. On 23 August 2019, Khangoshvili was assassinated in a Berlin park, by an alleged Russian GRU operative. Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Kadyrov is suspected of ordering the assassination of Khangoshvili.  Life  Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was born on 15 August 1979 into the family of Sultan Khangoshvili, in the Duisi village of the Pankisi Gorge, a region of Georgia home to a large ethnic Chechen population known as the Kist. He finished school there and later went to work in Chechnya, the residence of his elder brother Zurab, in the late 1990s. In 2001, Khangoshvili joined the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in its fight against Russia during the Second Chechen War. Khangoshvili was a field commander and had close ties to former Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov. Maskhadov was killed in March 2005 in a raid by the FSB, Russia's domestic intelligence agency. According to Khangoshvili's brother, Zurab, Zelimkhan participated in the June 2004 attack on security, military and police forces in the Russian Republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan, in which 88 police officials and civilians were killed; Zelimkhan himself was seriously wounded in the leg during the operation. Russian President Putin claimed that he was one of the perpetrators of the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings which left 40 people dead. After returning to his native Georgia, Khangoshvili commanded a Georgian anti-terror military unit in South Ossetia during the 2008 war, but his unit was never deployed. In 2016, Khangoshvili and his family, wife and four children, sought refuge in Germany after several attempts on his life in Georgia which his brother believes were orchestrated by Russian intelligence, although the accusation has been denied by the Russian authorities.  Assassination  On 23 August 2019, at around midday in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in Berlin Khangoshvili was walking through a wooded path of the park on his way back from the mosque he attended, when he was shot twice in the head by an alleged Russian assassin on a bike with a suppressed Glock 26. The gun and bicycle were afterwards dumped into the river Spree, but the alleged perpetrator, identified as 49 year-old Russian national \\"Vadim Sokolov\\" by German police, was apprehended. The Russian state and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov have been linked to the killing. The victim's body was later transported to his native village of Duisi in Georgia to be buried there on 29 August 2019.  Identifying Khangoshvili's assassin  Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov and director of the Grozny TV and radio company Adlan Bachaev. Some observers alleged that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov (right) was behind the assassination of Khangoshvili. Khangoshvili's alleged assassin, detained by German police, traveled on a valid Russian passport issued under the fake identity of Vadim Sokolov. Reporting by Der Spiegel and other media has disclosed that the suspect initially traveled from Moscow to Paris and then on to Warsaw, where he rented a hotel room for five days during which he traveled on to Berlin. Sokolov's passport was issued without any biometric data, the inclusion of which has been the default option for all Russian passports since 2009, except 'in emergency situations when the applicant has no time to wait for the fingerprint encryption and printing process.' In fact, 20 GRU operatives outed by Bellingcat in recent years, including those suspected of poisoning Skripal, have used these 'old-style' passports in ultimately futile attempts to hide their cover identities.\\" The investigative research network Bellingcat and, as became known later, also the investigative authorities came to the conclusion that Vadim Sokolov was actually Vadim Krasikov, born in August 1965 in the then Kazakh Socialist Soviet Republic. Vadim Krasikov was also named as a suspect in the murder of a Russian businessman on June 19, 2013 in Moscow. The murder was recorded by a surveillance camera and had a similar pattern: A cyclist murdered the businessman from behind with a head shot. The Russian Interpol wanted notice of April 23, 2014 against Vadim Krasikov was deleted on July 7, 2015 without giving a reason. Investigations by Bellingcat suggest that Vadim Krasikov was a member of the elite unit Vympel. Police investigations in connection with the murder in Berlin revealed that Vadim Sokolov and Vadim Krasikov are the same person. Personal connections between Vadim Sokolov and Zelimkhan Khangoshvili did not exist. On December 4, 2019, the Federal Attorney General took over the investigation into the case. This was justified by the fact that ‚Äúthere were sufficient factual indications that the killing of Tornike K. [= Zelimkhan Khangoshvili] was either commissioned by government agencies of the Russian Federation or those of the Autonomous Chechen Republic as part of the Russian Federation. On the same day, two members of the military intelligence service GRU in the Russian Embassy in Berlin were expelled from the country in connection with the investigation . The Federal Government spoke of a \\"warning shot\\" in this regard and justified the step with the fact that Russian Bodies have not yet cooperated in investigating the murder. A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry called the deportation ‚Äúunfriendly and unfounded‚Äù and announced retaliatory measures. On December 6, 2019, several media outlets reported that the Federal Intelligence Service had received credible information that a Russian secret service was attempting to kill Vadim S. while in remand targeted to prevent possible statements from him. Thereupon this was moved from the JVA Moabit to the high security wing of the JVA Tegel. On December 12, 2019, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced the expulsion of two German diplomats from Russia. A Russian government spokesman described the move as ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù and ‚Äúa standard diplomatic process.‚Äù In February 2020, Bellingcat suspected that the operation, both with training and with a false ID, was supported by the FSB. In June 2020 the Federal Prosecutor General brought charges against a Russian citizen, calling the act a contract killing and referring to the Government of the Russian Federation as the mastermind behind the contract killing. According to the prosecution, the background to the killing order was Khangoshvili's opposition to the Russian central state, the governments of its Autonomous Republics Chechnya and Ingushetia and the pro-Russian government Georgia. This was followed by a conversation between the Russian Ambassador to Germany with the Foreign Office. The prosecution also names Roman D. as a possible accomplice. This confirms the analysis of Bellingcat, that more than one person was involved in the murder and identified one of them. Bellingcat also points out that deliberately false references to the identity of the suspect were spread.  Diplomatic repercussions  On 4 December 2019, the German Federal Foreign Office accused Russia of refusing to cooperate in the investigation of Khangoshvili murder and expelled two Russian foreign office diplomatic employees working in Berlin. An official request for assistance in the case hadn't been put up until then; it was submitted to Russia two days after the expulsion. In response, Russia expelled two German diplomats on 12 December. On 10 August 2020, the Slovak Foreign Ministry announced that three diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bratislava are set to be expelled and they must leave the country by 13 August. Slovak authorities noted information provided by Slovak intelligence services that \\"the diplomats activities were in contradiction with the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,\\" according to a Slovak foreign ministry spokesman. He also added that \\"an abuse of visas issued at the Slovak general consulate in St Petersburg had attributed to this serious crime perpetrated on the territory of another EU and NATO member state\\".

It was built by war captives brought back to Bangkok from Pattani after the autonomous Muslim sultanate in the south was subjugated by an army commanded by the younger brother of the King, Somdet Phra Bawornrajchao Maha Sura Singhanat. His Majesty the King allowed the Pattani Muslims to build houses and a mosque within the city walls, granting them land in Ban Tuek Din (along present-day Ratchadamnoen avenue near the Democracy Monument and Satriwitthaya School) and in Bang Lamphu (near Chakraphong road).

This film marks the second collaboration of Anirudh with Dhanush, after his debut film 3. The soundtrack album features 8 songs, and all the lyrics in the film were written by Dhanush. Initially all the songs were mentioned to release on the first week of January 2014, but was postponed to February 2014, to add two more songs. The audio rights were acquired by Dhanush's newly formed music label Wunderbar Studios, a subsidiary of the production company Wunderbar Films, alongside with Divo, a newly formed digital streaming portal which is their first venture. All the songs in the film were rendered by Dhanush and Anirudh and initially no playback singers, recorded for the songs in addition, except S. Janaki, who recorded for \\"Amma Amma\\" written by Dhanush, who also sang for the track. The recording of the songs were completed within late December 2013. The tracklist was unveiled on 10 February 2014, in a form of a video teaser with the film's title theme song through YouTube. The complete album was launched on 14 February 2014, at the Suryan FM 93.5 Radio Station, Chennai with Dhanush, Amala Paul and Anirudh Ravichander in attendance. The soundtrack received mostly positive reviews. Anirudh promoted the album on Sun Music on 11 July 2014, a week before the film's release. The songs \\"Velaiilla Pattadhari\\", \\"Poo Indru Neeyaga\\", \\"What a Karuvad\\" and \\"Udhungada Sangu\\" topped the Radio Mirchi South charts for 31 weeks.

He criticised the use of only two male singers (Dhanush and Anirudh), stating that \\"other voices might have provided a fresher musical perspective to some of the tunes\\". Behindwoods rated the album 3.5 out of 5, stating that \\"Velaiyilla Pattathari is a solid album from the Anirudh Ravichander- Dhanush combination. The duo strike again!\\" Moviecrow rated the album 7.5/10, stating that \\"Anirudh's consistency is mind boggling so far with 4 out of 4 chartbuster hit albums. Anirudh is proving that he is truly a prodigy, at least so far. What's amazing is all his 4 movies are for new directors and 2 out of 4 movies for emerging heroes such as Sivakarthikeyan and Siva. Just imagine what this young talent could do as he starts working with accomplished directors and actors in 2014.\\" Indiaglitz rated 3.25 out of 5 stating \\"The effort that went into the album's creation is evident and the success is the proof.

Early Life  Klopfer was born on August 28, 1940, in Dresden, Germany. He told documentary filmmaker Mark Archer that he was staying with his aunt in the Dresden suburbs when the allies firebombed the city in 1945. Klopfer would have been four and a half years old at the time. This event, Archer noted, seemed to have been the defining moment of Klopfer's life. Passenger records indicate that Klopfer came to the United States with his family aboard the Italia in 1952 at the age of 11.Year: 1952; Arrival: New York, New York; Microfilm Serial: T715, 1897-1957; Microfilm Roll: Roll 8156; Line: 8; Page Number: 270 He used both his first name and the American spelling of his middle name, George, when attending Bloomfield High School in Bloomfield Hills, MI. He was a record-breaking runner on the track team and hoped to represent the United States in the Olympics. Upon graduating in 1959 he planned to become a chemical engineer.\\"U.S., School Yearbooks, 1880-2012\\"; School Name: Bloomfield Hills High School; Year: 1959 He was naturalized as a US citizen in Detroit, MI, on May 31, 1960.  Education and Early Medical Career  Klopfer attended the University of Michigan during the period 1960-1962. He graduated from Wayne State University in 1965 with a degree in organic chemistry. He graduated from the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1971. He did his medical internship and residency at Chicago Osteopathic Hospital, completing his residency on July 31, 1976. Klopfer became licensed to practice medicine in Illinois, Florida, and South Dakota before applying for his Indiana license in 1978. He served as a staff physician at Community Hospital in Evanston, IL and as a clinical instructor at Chicago Osteopathic Hospital. In 1978 Klopfer gained a Physician's Temporary Permit to work at Women's Pavilion, an abortion facility in South Bend, IN. Klopfer originally worked at Women's Pavilion as a substitute for another physician. By November of that year he was also performing abortions at Chicago Loop Mediclinic.  Public Attention  Klopfer first gained notoriety in November 1978 when the Chicago Sun-Times published its \\"The Abortion Profiteers\\" series documenting illegal and otherwise troubling practices among Chicago-area abortion facilities. A nurse reported to an undercover investigator that Dr. Ming Kow Hah and Klopfer would race each other to see who could complete the most abortions in a single day. ‚ÄúWhen Hah is here, Klopfer really zips. Hah marks the patients on his leg, and if Klopfer sees that Hah‚Äôs got a leg full, he goes like wildfire to catch up.‚Äù Another nurse said, ‚ÄúKlopfer would be having a cup of coffee and be on his last sip when he‚Äôd jump up and say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd better get going or Hah will have the whole recovery room full.'‚Äù In September 2019, he gained attention when the sheriff's office of Will County, Illinois, said that authorities had found 2,246 preserved fetal remains at his home. An additional 165 remains were found in the trunk of a car in October, totaling 2,411 fetal remains. Klopfer had been a longtime doctor at an abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana, and had also practiced in Gary, Indiana, and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In August 2016, the Indiana Medical Licensing Board suspended his medical license for failing to exercise reasonable care and violating several documentation requirements. When family members of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer began clearing out his belongings from his home after his passing, they made the gruesome discovery, according to Chicago‚Äôs ABC 7. The family found the human remains and reported their find to authorities. ‚ÄúThe family had no knowledge of it, and when they found it, they followed my instructions, and they contacted the Will County Coroner‚Äôs Office and the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Department,‚Äù said Chicago's criminal attorney Kevin Bolger.

In intervening years, he worked from 1783-1785 as a gold- and silversmith in Philadelphia, and from 1786-1814 as a gold- and silversmith in New York City. In 1786 he was a member of Gold and Silversmiths' Society, and listed in the New York City directory at 13 or 18 Maiden Lane. * \\"A Premonition to those Gentlemen that may hereafter have an Occasion to employ a Silver-Smith, to beware of that Villain Benjamin Halsted; lest they be bit by him, as I have been. : \\"Andrew Bowne.\\" - The New-York Gazette or the Weekly Post-Boy, New York City, August 16, 1764. * \\"The Subscriber finds himself obliged, with infinite Reluctance, to address the Public on Account of a surrilous Advertisement in the New-York Gazette of Thursday last Week, signed by one Andrew Bowne. The Character and Reputation of a Man in Trade, being of the most delicate and tender Nature, any Attempts to stigmatize it, not founded on Facts, or supported by Evidence, will never, I flatter myself, influence the impartial Part of Mankind, before the Truth has been scrutinized in a legal Manner. But, some Time must elapse before this can be done: And as the Audaciousness of the Advertisement may make impressions to my Prejudice, I shall endeavour to remove them, by laying all my Transactions with Bowne, open to the Public; where by it may easily be perceived the Means by which his Brain was so violently heated as to overcome his reason. : \\"Andrew Bowne, of Shrewsbury, called on me last Summer, telling me Joseph Holmes, of this City, had recommended me to him as an honest Silversmith. He then bespoke a Set of Silver Buttons for a Suit of Clothes. They were made exactly to his Directions; and when he came to fetch them he seemed perfectly pleased with them. Three Weeks afterwards he called on me, and desired I would take them back. I represented to him how unsaleable Things made after another's Whim were; and that before I found a Person of his Taste, Years might elapse. He then offered me a Dollar; which I refusing he grew passionate, and went away in the greatest Anger. On his Return Home, he wrote me the Annexed Letter (No. 1) which I despised, and returned no answer to. Last May he wrote me another (No. 2) in both which he has been very lavish of Names that no honest Man can well brook. I returned him an Answer (No. 3) with a View to pass the Affair into Ridicule; but it had a contrary Effect; and the Advertisement in Question was produced by it. : \\"Private Affairs, of a trivial and insignificant Nature, are unworthy of the Attention of the Public.

It is the headquarters of West Sussex County Council. History Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, the town hall in Horsham was used initially as the meeting place for West Sussex County Council. After finding that the town hall was too cramped to accommodate both the town council and the county council, county leaders decided to acquire Edes House in West Street in Chichester as a meeting place and administrative centre in 1916. By the late 1920s county leaders were seeking larger facilities: the site they chose was open land to the north of Edes House. The new building, which was designed by Cecil G Stillman, the County Architect, in the Georgian Revival style, was completed in 1933. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with twenty-one bays facing onto a central courtyard; the central section of eleven bays, which projected slightly forward, featured a doorway on the ground floor flanked by Ionic order columns supporting an entablature with a pediment above; there was a tall round-headed window between the first and second floors with an open round-headed pediment above; the end sections of the main frontage contained arched carriageways to permit vehicle access to the rear of the site and there were side wings beyond that. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber. The main building was altered in the 1960s to accommodate an emergency control centre in case of a nuclear attack. The county council also acquired a Victorian mansion known as \\"The Grange\\" at that time: the old house, which was located to the north east of the main building, was demolished and replaced by a modern office block also known as \\"The Grange\\". Another modern facility known as \\"Northleigh House\\" was built just south of The Grange in 1974. The Princess Royal attended a reception for the Council of Occupational Therapists in County Hall on 19 April 2010 and a major programme of refurbishment works to convert the building into an open-plan working environment was completed in 2011.

The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source. This page details related allegations, reactions, and investigations, in Asia.  Armenia  The Panama Papers show Major-General of Justice and head of Armenia's Compulsory Enforcement Service Mihran Poghosyan was connected to three Panama-registered companies: Sigtem Real Estates Inc., Hopkinten Trading Inc., and Bangio Invest S.A., which issued bearer shares only. Poghosyan, who has a degree in economics, was the sole owner of Sigtem and Hopkinten, which together owned Best Realty Ltd, recently awarded government contracts. Poghosian resigned April 18, saying that it was unacceptable that he had caused Armenia's name to be mentioned alongside that of Azerbaijan, whose president Ilham Aliyev \\"actually embezzled billions of dollars.\\" On April 8, Armenian Transparency International Anti-Corruption Center filed a petition with the Ethics Committee for High Level Officials, requesting an investigation of Poghosyan. Members of the families of Poghosyan's uncles Grigor and Mikhail Haroutyunyan were also mentioned in connection with his business. Varuzhan Hotkanian, head of the Armenian branch of the anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, said that perhaps Poghosian was forced to resign by the country's leadership, since the evidence pointed directly to him. But, he said, he still questions the government's commitment to fighting corruption. Leading opposition figure Levon Zourabian demanded answers on the matter from the floor of Parliament.  Azerbaijan  President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev Azerbaijan International Mineral Resources Operating Company Ltd (AIMROC) and its consortium partners spent nearly US$230 million to open a mine and build a refinery in the western Azerbaijani village of Chovdar. AIMROC possibly produced US$30 million in gold before suddenly disappearing without making payroll in May 2014. Mine employees officially remain on vacation and under Azerbaijani law full-time employees cannot seek work elsewhere even though they have not been paid for two years. A 2012 investigation, by Radio Free Europe and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered that through overseas holding companies, the daughters of Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev owned an interest in a gold mine operation created by a 2006 presidential decree forming a consortium, then awarding it a 30-year lease over environmental and transparency objections in Parliament. But the Panama Papers made it possible to trace some of the elaborate network of shell companies that manage the ownership of the mines, and in 2016 OCCRP was able to establish that in fact the daughters control the mining operation. Aliyev awarded the gold mines to Globex International LLP, Londex Resources S.A., Willy & Meyris S.A. and Fargate Mining Corporation. Thirty percent of the proceeds were allocated to the government of Azerbaijan; 11% of the remaining 70% went to Globex, 45% to Londex, 29% to Willy & Meyris and the remaining 15% to Fargate. These companies were registered in Panama, according to the documents obtained from Panama Registry of Companies. A one of them, Fargate Mining Corporation was founded by Tagiva Management Ltd., Tagiva Services Ltd. and Verda Management Ltd. They issued the General Power of Attorney granted in favour of Azerbaijan-born individual Mr. Nasib Hasanov. Later, Londex Resources S.A., Globex International LLP, Fargate Mining Corporation and Willy&Meyris; S.A. had been registered again at St. Kitts and Nevis with same addresses. It already used for registering other offshore energy holding ‚Äì The Nobel Oil Ltd., partner of the state oil company SOCAR in Azerbaijan over Umid gas field. Founder of Nobel Oil Group also is Mr. N. Hasanov. The 2012 investigation's reporters established that Globex was owned through shell companies in Panama, and that these shell companies belonged to the president's daughters and a Swiss businessman whose name appears in other shell companies such as those that manage Azerphone, the family telecommunications monopoly. Villagers told reporters they hoped to work at the mine, which paid $12 a day, and asked them to intervene with the president about the problems the mine was causing with the water supply. They became angry and did not believe the reporters when they said the president's family had a stake in the mine. Following the May publication of this report, the National Assembly passed a law making it illegal to report company ownership and another giving former presidents and first ladies lifelong legal immunity. Khadija Ismayilova, the Radio Free Europe reporter on the 2012 investigation was subjected to escalating legal and public harassment. She was threatened and eventually arrested. She is currently serving a 7.5 year sentence for tax evasion and abuse of power. Leaked Mossack Fonseca documents made it possible to establish that the daughters also owned Londex, the majority partner in the gold enterprise. It is not entirely clear why they shut the operation down but industry experts familiar with the consortium say it did not seem very experienced and may have rushed into production. According to the ICIJ, Aliyev's daughter Arzu not only has financial stakes not only in gold rights but also in Azerfon, the country's largest mobile phone business. She has shares in SW Holding, which \\"controls nearly every operation related to Azerbaijan Airlines\\" (Azal), from meals to airport taxis. Both sisters and their brother Heydar own property in Dubai valued at roughly $75 million in 2010; Heydar is the legal owner of nine luxury mansions in Dubai purchased for some $44 million. Leaked documents show that daughters Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva both hold shares in Exaltation Limited, incorporated in April 2015 for \\"holding UK property\\". Child & Child, a London law firm that registered it and obtained nominee directors for it though the Jersey branch of Mossack, claimed in doing so that the women had no political connections. The family of Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev leads a well-off life thanks in part to financial interests in various sectors of the nation's economy. His wife ascendants are privileged and powerful family that owns banks, insurance and construction companies, a television station and a line of cosmetics. She is well known for her pre-eminent charity work that has led to the construction of schools, hospitals and the country's major sports complex.  Bangladesh  On April 7, 2016, the Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh launched an inquiry to obtain details of the businesses and individuals allegedly affiliated with Mossack Fonseca. Allegations have been made against thirty-two Bangladeshi individuals and two corporations, media outlets staking this claim have referenced an ICIJ database of information compiled during the investigation of the 2013 Offshore Leaks.  China  Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China have been named, including former Premier Li Peng's daughter Li Xiaolin, former Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang's son Hu Dehua and Deng Jiagui, the brother-in-law of current general secretary Xi Jinping. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became General Secretary of the Communist Party (paramount leader) in November 2012. Others named include the son and daughter-in-law of propaganda chief Liu Yunshan and the son-in-law of Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli. Official Chinese statistics show investment in British Overseas Territories acting as tax havens being much more significant than in other places: $44 billion invested in the Cayman Islands and $49 billion in the British Virgin Islands. Despite these figures \\"probably exclud[ing] the private investments of the many family members of the ruling elite who have channelled money through the BVI\\", both figures exceed Chinese investment in the United States and United Kingdom. China's government is suppressing mention of the Panama Papers on social media and in search engines results, and reportedly told news organizations to delete all content related to the Panama Papers leak. Chinese authorities consider the material a concerted foreign media attack on China, and ordered Internet information offices to delete reports reprinted from the Panama Papers, and with no exceptions not to follow up on related content. Hong Lei, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, responded that he had \\"no comment\\" for \\"such groundless accusations\\" at an April 5 news conference. A screenshot showed that authorities had forced all websites to delete content about the Panama Papers. Foreign websites such as WikiLeaks and China Digital Times are blocked from mainland China. On Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media website, censors deleted content about the Panama Paper. However, the name of Xi's brother-in-law got through, and Weibo users tried to circumvent them with less obvious language such as \\"brother-in-law\\", \\"Canal Papers\\" (for the Panama Canal), and so on. Despite the censorship, Weibo search ranking was topped by phrases seemingly related to the Panama Papers, such as \\"tax evasion\\", \\"document\\", \\"leak\\" and \\"Putin\\". Chinese entertainment magnate and art collector Wang Zhongjun also appears in the documents and did not respond to a request for comment. According to the Tax Justice Network, Chinese investors sometimes use overseas companies to take advantage of incentives China offers to foreign investors. Canadian broadcaster Radio Canada has reported that Hong Kong-based CITIC Pacific had Mossack Fonseca set up or manage more than 90 subsidiaries, and that the Chinese government was a majority stakeholder, according to fiscal expert Marwah Rizqy, a Canadian politician and former professor of tax law at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. = Hong Kong = Mossack Fonseca's Hong Kong office was its busiest, says the ICIJ, as Chinese officials and other wealthy figures would carry funds across the border and deposit them there to be channeled to offshore entities. Hong Kong invested HK$4.6 trillion (¬£360 billion) into the BVI ‚Äì more than Hong Kong invested in mainland China ‚Äì and received HK$4.1 trillion (over ¬£300 billion) from the BVI. A further ¬£20 billion or so was placed into the Cayman Islands and Bermuda individually. Newspaper Ming Pao fired deputy editor Keung Kwok-yuen following a front-page article on the Panama Papers which mentioned many prominent Hong Kong citizens. The paper blamed a \\"difficult business environment,\\" but had previously fired another editor in 2014 over another leak of offshore documents. Employees have been publishing blank columns scattered through the newspaper in protest of his dismissal. Polytechnic University has two offshore companies set up by Mossack Fonseca in 2012 and 2013. One was created by vice-president Nicholas Yang Wei-hsiung, who became IT minister of Hong Kong.  Georgia  Bidzina Ivanishvili, former Prime Minister of Georgia Bidzina Ivanishvili became wealthy in Russia before returning to Georgia and becoming prime minister in 2012; his public official's asset declaration was 72 pages long. However, he does not list Lynden Management, a Mossack Fonseca company which held about 20% of the shares of Raptor Pharmaceuticals (which he did declare), a US-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He refused for nearly four years to provide a copy of his passport and a proof of address to the law firm, which needed it to comply with money-laundering regulations as well as inquiries into the company by the Financial Investigation Agency of the British Virgin Islands. Forbes calculates Ivanishvili's net worth at $4.8 billion.  India  Bollywood celebrities Amitabh Bachchan, his daughter-in-law and actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and actor Ajay Devgan are listed in the papers. Bachchan has denied any connection to overseas companies, and a spokesman for Rai also questioned the documents' authenticity. Bachchan repeated the denial in response to an August 21 report that he was listed as a director of two companies and participated in board meetings. Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan is listed in Panama Papers Also listed are real estate developer and DLF CEO Kushal Pal Singh, Sameer Gehlaut of the Indiabulls group, and Iqbal Mirchi. Shares of both companies fell following the release of the papers, as well as those of Apollo Tyres, which had also been mentioned. DLF said it had invested in existing overseas companies in compliance with the LRS Scheme set up in 2004 and reported this to the Indian tax agency. An Apollo spokesman said that the family members of Chairman Onkar Kanwar who had been reported as owning offshore companies did not live in India and had complied with the law where they resided. Gehlaut said he had paid full taxes and made full disclosures. Indian politicians on the list include Shishir Bajoria from West Bengal and Anurag Kejriwal, former chief of the Delhi Lok Satta Party. Bajoria said he owned two other Isle of Man companies but not the one ascribed to him in the leaked documents. Corporate services provider First Names Group acknowledged erroneously providing his information to Mossack Fonseca. MF records show Kejriwal as director of three offshore companies based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), and holding two private foundations in Panama and power of attorney of another BVI company. He acknowledged having had offshore companies but said he shut them down after a short period of time. The name of deceased drug kingpin Iqbal Mirchi has also surfaced in the papers. Some 500 Indian citizens appear to be mentioned. Indian government ordered an inquiry, and subsequently announced that it was constituting a special multi-agency group comprising officers from the investigative unit of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and its Foreign Tax and Tax Research Division, the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Reserve Bank of India.  Israel  Some 600 Israeli companies and 850 Israeli shareholders are listed. Among the Israeli names found in the leaked documents are top attorney Dov Weissglass, who was the bureau chief of deceased prime minister Ariel Sharon; Jacob Engel, a businessman active in the African mining industry; and Idan Ofer, a member of one of Israel's wealthiest families, according to Haaretz. Weissglass' name appears as a sole owner of one of four companies set up by his business partner Assaf Halkin. The company, Talaville Global, was registered in the British Virgin Islands in May 2012, according to Haaretz, and seven months later, all of its shares were mortgaged against a loan from a Vienna bank. Weissglass and Halkin told Haaretz that the company \\"was registered for the purpose of receiving a loan from the bank in order to invest in European properties. The bank would only allow a loan to a corporation... [the] company activity is reported to the tax authorities in Israel. The required tax on the said activity is paid in Israel.\\" Many leaked documents reference Bank Leumi, primarily its branch on the island tax haven of Jersey. One of its customers, billionaire Teddy Sagi, made his fortune developing online gambling technology in England and recently developed the Camden Market commercial real estate space. Sagi is sole shareholder of at least 16 Mossack Fonseca offshore companies, mostly real estate ventures. Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz was also a Mossack Fonseca customer, with 282 companies.  Pakistan  = Nawaz Sharif = Nawaz Sharif, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif was the second top official to be ruled out as the result of information disclosures in the Panama Papers. Supreme Court disqualified him from office. One judge said that Mr Sharif was no longer \\"eligible to be an honest member of the parliament\\". Pakistan's ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), was permitted by the speaker of the National Assembly to select an interim prime minister until the 2018 general election. The Supreme Court verdict was announced in the context of heightened security in the capital. Over 3,000 armed police and members of the Pakistan Rangers paramilitary force were deployed around the Supreme Court. The verdict followed months of dramatic news coverage and social media debates, the divisions falling largely along party lines. A hearing on October 18, 2017 resulted in an indictment for Sharif, who has faced allegations of corruption since the 1980s. The Panama Papers corroborated a federal inquiry in the mid-1990s and name both Nawaz Sharif and his younger brother, Punjab chief minister Shebaz Sharif. They also link in-laws of Shebaz Sharif and children of Nawaz Sharif to offshore companies. Mossack Fonseca records tie Nawaz' daughter Maryam Nawaz and her brothers Hussein and Hassan to four offshore companies, Nescoll Limited, Nielson Holdings Limited, Coomber Group Inc., and Hangon Property Holdings Limited. The companies acquired luxury real estate in London during 2006‚Äì2007. The real estate was collateral for loans of up to $13.8 million, according to the Panama Papers. The prime minister's children say the money came from the sale of a family business in Saudi Arabia. But these offshore companies and assets were not disclosed on his family's wealth statement and the suspicion that the companies were meant to hide or launder ill-gotten wealth or to avoid taxes called Sharif's ethics into question. Prior to the ruling, Maryam Nawaz had tweeted denial of wrongdoing, adding that she did not own \\"any company/property abroad,\\" except as \\"a trustee\\" in a brother's corporation, \\"which only entitles me to distribute assets to my brother Hussain's family/children if needed.\\" The leaked documents name her as a trustee of Nescoll, created in 1993, and Nielson, first registered in 1994. The two companies subscribed to Mossack Fonseca services in July 2006. Mossack Fonseca was managing Nescoll, Nielsen Holdings, and Coomber Group when the three companies obtained a ¬£7 million mortgage from the Swiss bank, Deutsche Bank (Suisse) SA and purchased four flats in Avenfield House, at 118 Park Lane in London. Hassan, the other brother, bought Hangon Holdings and its stock in 2007 for ¬£5.5 million; Hangon then bought property, financed through the Bank of Scotland, at 1 Hyde Park Place in London. Samina Durrani, mother of Shebaz Sharif's second wife, and Ilyas Mehraj, brother of his first, also figure in the documents. Habib Waqas Group/Ilyas Mehraj is listed as a shareholder with 127,735 shares in Haylandale Limited, registered July 24, 2003 in the Bahamas. Mehraj has denied knowing anything about \\"any company whether incorporated in the Commonwealth of Bahamas or anywhere else under the name: Haylandale Ltd.\\" Rainbow Limited, the newest of the three offshore companies owned by Samina Durrani, was registered September 29, 2010 in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Armani River Limited, registered in the Bahamas on May 16, 2002, describes its assets as \\"property in London, which is not currently rented.\\" Assets of Star Precision Limited, registered in BVI May 21, 1997, were reported as \\"cash as the investment portfolio. We are also holding 1,165,238 shares in Orix Leasing Pakistan Limited.\\" Hussain Nawaz said his family won't hamper any investigation, and urged one of former president Pervez Musharraf as well. The government on April 15 announced an investigation by an inquiry commission of all Pakistanis named in the documents. Opposition politicians said a judge, not a retired judge, should investigate. Numerous judges recused themselves. On July 28, 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, disqualified Sharif from holding office. = Benazir Bhutto = The late Benazir Bhutto was also a Mossack Fonseca client. In 2001 the firm set up BVI company Petroline International Inc. for Bhutto, her nephew Hassan Ali Jaffery Bhutto, and her aide and head of security Rehman Malik, who later became a Senator and Interior Minister in the government of Yousaf Raza Gillani. Mossack Fonseca had deemed Bhutto's first company, the similarly named Petrofine FZC, politically sensitive and \\"declined to accept Mrs Bhutto as a client.\\" A United Nations committee chaired by former US Federal Reserve head Paul Volcker had determined in a 2005 investigation into abuses of the oil-for-food program that Petrofine FZC paid US$2 million to the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein to obtain US$115‚Äì145 million in oil contracts. In 2006, the Pakistani National Accountability Bureau (NAB) accused Bhutto, Malik and Ali Jaffery of owning Petrofine, established since 2000 in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party denied it. In April 2006 an NAB court froze assets owned in Pakistan and elsewhere by Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari, saying that the assets, totaling $1.5 billion, were the result of corrupt practices, and that Swiss charges of criminal money laundering filed in 1997 were still in litigation.  Palestine  Tareq Abbas, a son of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was revealed to hold $1 million in shares of the Arab Palestinian Investment Company (APIC), an offshore company associated with the Palestinian Authority and partially owned by the Authority's Palestine Investment Fund. Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, former prime minister of Qatar  Qatar  Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, prime minister from 2007 to 2013, in 2002 acquired three shell companies incorporated in the Bahamas and another in the British Virgin Islands and through them moorage in Mallorca and a $300 million yacht named Al Mirqab. The Panama Papers indicate he owns or owned eight shell companies. Subsequent reporting by Forbes found that Al Thani bought $700 million in Deutsche Bank shares in 2014 through Paramount Services Holdings and in 2015 transferred roughly half the stock to Supreme Universal Holdings, owned by a relative who had left office as emir of Qatar, also in 2013.  Saudi Arabia  King Salman of Saudi Arabia King Salman is mentioned in the leaks in relation to two companies based in the British Virgin Islands‚ÄîVerse Development Corporation, incorporated in 1999, and Inrow Corporation, incorporated in 2002. The companies took out mortgages totaling over US$34 million and purchased properties in central London. His role in the companies was not specified. BVI company Crassus Limited, incorporated in 2004, registered a yacht in London, named Erga after King Salman's palace in Riyadh. The vessel boasts a banquet hall and can comfortably sleep 30. Former Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef is also named in the papers. The Irish Times found a link to Iran-Contra in the Panama Papers, in the persons of one of America's most colourful political donors Farhad Azima and multi-billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, who both employed Mossack Fonseca's services, and were both important figures in Iran-Contra scandal. The Mossack Fonseca files show Khashoggi appeared as early as 1978, when he became president of the Panamanian company ISIS Overseas S.A. The documents reveal that Fonseca's clients included Sheikh Kamal Adham, Saudi Arabia's first intelligence chief (1963‚Äì79), brother-in-law of King Faisal, who was named by a US Senate committee as the CIA's ‚Äúprincipal liaison for the entire the Middle East from the mid-1960s through 1979‚Äù. Adham controlled offshore companies involved in the B.C.C.I. banking scandal.Will Fitzgibbon and Nicolas Richter: Panama Papers: CIA-Agents used companies from Panama Operation Goldfinger, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung  Singapore  The Ministry of Finance and Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a statement that \\"Singapore takes a serious view on tax evasion and will not tolerate its business and financial centre being used to facilitate tax related crimes. If there is evidence of wrongdoing by any individual or entity in Singapore, we will not hesitate to take firm action.\\"  Sri Lanka  Sri Lankan Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said his panel will investigate Sri Lankan names that come up in the Panama Papers, as well as the 46 who appear in the 2013 Offshore Leaks, according to the Daily Mail, since earlier leadership apparently did not do so. The country has many large outstanding foreign loans taken out under the administration of former president Mahinda Rajapakse, and the current government recently had to obtain a US$1.5 billion IMF bailout. Rajapakse has denied diverting funds. The current government came to power in January 2016 on an anti-corruption platform.  Syria  Rami Makhlouf, a maternal cousin of Bashar Al-Assad, was worth an estimated $5 billion before the Syrian Civil War, and had control of 60% of the economy. He was subject to sanctions by the United States and the European Union, and controlled Syria's oil and telecommunications business. The US Treasury charged that Pangates, a company registered to him, supplied the Assad government with a thousand tonnes of aviation fuel. However, the Makhloufs were able to continue to operate via Panama shell companies, registered in the British Virgin Islands, and so not subject to US law ‚Äì however, on May 9, 2011, the EU issued its own sanctions, and these were extended by an order in council to the British Virgin Islands in July 2011. Mossack Fonseca decided September 6 to resign from Makhlouf's companies. By then, Makhlouf had already cut ties with his bank. HSBC told the law firm that the Swiss authorities had frozen Makhlouf's accounts, and that \\"they have had no contact with the beneficial owner of this company since the last 3 months\\".  Thailand  The Bangkok Post reported that the \\"Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) is seeking information from its foreign counterparts regarding twenty-one Thai nationals reportedly included in a list of people worldwide using a Panama-based law firm apparently specializing in money laundering and tax evasion.\\" It is not clear why AMLO is investigating only twenty-one. The Panama Papers include at least 780 names of individuals based in Thailand and another 50 companies based in Thailand. Some are foreigners or foreign-owned companies, but 634 individual addresses in Thailand appear in the documents that have surfaced to date, including the CEOs of giant companies Bangkok Land and Phatra Finance. Taiwan Investigations by ICIJ's sole East Asian partner CommonWealth Magazine in Taiwan found that at least 2,725 offshore companies had registered addresses in Taiwan. Ninety Taiwanese, including the singer and actor Nicky Wu, were included in the papers.„ÄäÂ§©‰∏ã„ÄãË™øÊü•ÔºöÂ∑¥ÊãøÈ¶¨Êñá‰ª∂Ê≤íÊúâÂè∞ÁÅ£ÊîøÊ≤ª‰∫∫Áâ© Ëóù‰∫∫Âê≥Â•áÈöÜÂçªÊ¶ú‰∏äÊúâÂêç-Âè∞ÁÅ£ÔΩúICIJ ÂúãÈöõË™øÊü•Ë®òËÄÖÂêåÁõüÔΩúÂ∑¥ÊãøÈ¶¨ÔΩúÂ§©‰∏ãÔΩúÂ∑¥ÊãøÈ¶¨Êñá‰ª∂ÔΩúÂê≥Â•áÈöÜ-È¢®ÂÇ≥Â™í- ÊñΩÂ≠ùË°° According to a report released by CommonWealth Magazine, Wu used the firm Horizon Sky Technology, Ltd. to co-operate with Hong Kong-based Sun Entertainment Culture Limited (zh). The publisher concludes that: \\"Taiwanese companies and individuals are believed to be extensively using offshore shelters to avoid or evade taxes ... after scouring the Panama Papers documents that Mossack Fonseca has not been one of their main conduits. This time, it appears that big Taiwanese banks, law firms and accounting firms did not often use the services of Mossack Fonseca, which does not have a presence in Taiwan. The forty-six Taiwanese brokers that did work with Mossack Fonseca were relatively small-scale consulting firms operating in Greater China. Most of the Taiwanese entities that set up shell companies through the Panamanian law firm were small, unlisted companies or individuals.\\"  United Arab Emirates  United Arab Emirates President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan ICIJ, The Guardian and The Independent have reported that UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan owns London real estate worth more than ¬£1.2 billion through a structure of some thirty shell companies Mossack Fonseca set up for him in the British Virgin Islands and administer for him, using them to manage and control the luxury properties in London. By December 2015, Mossack Fonseca held nearly all of the shares in those companies in trust structures on his behalf, with the President and his wife, son and daughter the trust beneficiaries.

The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source. This page details related allegations, reactions, and investigations, in North America.  Canada  Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has denied any involvement in the affair, saying he had \\"entirely and completely been transparent about mine and my family's finances. That is something I learned early on that Canadians expect from their leaders.\\" Canada Revenue Agency said in a statement that its current tax evasion audits include \\"some Canadian clients associated with law firm Mossack Fonseca,\\" and added that it would \\"communicate\\" with its treaty partners to obtain any further information that may not currently be in its possession.\\" The CRA has tax treaties with 92 different countries and 22 Tax Information Exchange Agreements. The CRA has begun or completed 116 audits and 234 more are planned. These investigations are expected to recoup at least $11 million in taxes and fines. Fewer than 10 related criminal investigations are in progress. The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) denied any wrongdoing associated with the 370+ clients it had referred to Mossack Fonseca over the years.\\"We have an extensive due diligence process... RBC works within the legal and regulatory framework of every country in which we operate,\\" said a bank spokesman. CEO David McKay said the bank will review the four decades of documentation for any problems. CEO Bill Downe of the Bank of Montreal said \\"Canadian banks have 'dramatically' beefed up anti-money laundering control over the last seven to 10 years,\\" and added that any link between Canadian businesses and the Panama Papers companies would have originated a long time ago, before Canadian banks took action to stop money laundering. Some individuals did surface in the leaked documents, according to ICIJ partner in the investigation Toronto Star. * John Mark Wright, a mutual fund broker, had three shell companies in the British Virgin Islands for handling profits from a mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. * Eric Van Nguyen, a Montreal resident with registered companies in Samoa and another in the British Virgin Islands. He also faces fraud charges in the New York state in a penny stock scheme. * Brian Shamess, a sports physician from Sault Ste Marie, used a Mossack Fonseca company to buy a condo on Panama Bay in 2011. * Eric Marc Levine operates fitness clubs in Asia and has registered at least 15 companies in the British Virgin Islands through Mossack Fonseca. The Thai Anti-Money Laundering Office froze some of his business assets following fraud allegations; Levine responded with a defamation suit. * Former Newfoundland Cabinet minister Chuck Furey incorporated in Panama to buy a condo in 2008. He said no longer has overseas holdings. * Mixed martial arts trainer Dave Feser of Vancouver set up a business in British Anguilla with an office in Switzerland. \\"There's nothing even associated with this company,\\" Feser told the Star. Canadians for Tax Fairness had calculated that legal tax avoidance by corporations alone cost the Canadian treasury almost $8 billion Canadian a year. When it calculated the 2015 numbers, they found that corporations and individuals combined sent CAN$40 billion of declared assets to tax havens, and the ten most popular alone now held $270 billion Canadian in assets.  Costa Rica  The administration of President Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s suggested that some of the activity unveiled by the leaked documents suggests attempts to evade taxes. His administration's effort to implement tax increases and reforms has met strong resistance from opposition and business figures. Leaked documents suggest that Mossack Fonseca helped tuna export company Borda Azul set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in order to avoid Costa Rican taxes. The firm, now out of business, was headed by Hermes Navarro, president of the Costa Rican Football Federation from 1999 to 2006. In the late 1990s the Finance Ministry and Prosecutor's Office investigated Borda Azul and other export companies for allegedly misusing tax credit certificates; in 1997 dozens of companies had been accused of using the certificates for fraud and to launder drug profits. According to ICIJ investigative partners DataBaseAR and Seminario Universidad, Mossack Fonseca helped Borda Azul fabricate invoices to allow it to report both inflated costs‚Äîto reduce its taxes‚Äîand inflated exports, to allow it to continue to qualify for the tax credit certificates. In a letter dated October 19, 1998, a Mossack Fonseca lawyer explained the investigation to the Panama City office and concluded: More than thirty Costa Rican law firms are mentioned in the Panama Papers as referring clients to Mossack Fonseca, resulting in the creation of more than 360 shell companies. in particular Gonzalo Fajardo & Asociados, founded by former Finance Ministry official and later Economy Minister Gonzalo Fajardo Salas, and over nearly two decades helped Costa Rican companies set up 82 offshore corporations in tax havens, according to DataBaseAR. Finance Vice Minister Fernando Rodr√≠guez said Costa Rica will push to sign a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with Panama. Legislators from several parties are trying to line up political consensus to seek approval of the administration's tax fraud bill and to form a legislative commission to investigate those named in the Panama Papers, according to Emilia Molina Cruz of the Citizens' Action Party. While opposition parties have maintained that the country's financial problems stem from excess spending, according to the Finance Department, the sums Costa Rica loses to tax evasion equal about 8% of the country's gross domestic product, while its deficits have run at about 6%.  Mexico  The leaked files identified the \\"favourite contractor\\" of former Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.A well-connected Mexican tycoon stashes a fortune overseas \\". The McClatchy DC. April 3, 2016. Arist√≥teles N√∫√±ez, in charge at the time of the government's tax administration, Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria, said that people involved in the Panama Papers case can still make tax declarations and pay taxes on their investments. Being Mexican and having foreign investments or bank accounts is not a crime, but having income and not declaring it is illegal. If investments are categorized as tax evasion, fines of up to 100% of the omitted tax payment can result, as well as three months to nine years imprisonment. * Mexican actress Edith Gonz√°lez is linked to the scandal through her husband Lorenzo Lazo Marg√°in. * Ricardo Salinas Pliego, president of Grupo Salinas, which includes Azteca, Banco Azteca and Azteca Foundation among others, used an offshore company set up in the Virgin Islands to purchase a yacht, Azteca II, flagged in the Cayman Islands. Felicitas Holdings Limited, registered in the British Virgin Islands, spent ¬£261 million in 2014 on art by Francisco de Goya and also bought works by Mexican painter Manuel Serrano; the press director of Grupo Salinas told Forbes that all of Pliego's transactions complied with the law. * Juan Armando Hinojosa Cant√∫, a close friend of former Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, enlisted Mossack Fonseca to create trusts for accounts worth US$100 million after he was investigated for allegedly giving special favours to the former Mexican president and his wife, according to an analysis by ICIJ, who said that the documents showed \\"a complex offshore network\\" of nine companies in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Described as Pe√±a Nieto's \\"favorite contractor\\", Hinojosa's companies have won more than eighty government contracts and received at least US$2.8 billion in state money, The New York Times reported last year. According to Forbes, \\"Hinojosa and other prominent Mexicans, mostly businessmen with close ties to the government, including at least one member of the Forbes billionaires list, were the subject of extensive articles published online by ICIJ investigation partners Proceso and Aristegui Noticias Sunday.\\"\\"Mexican Government Contractor Who Built First Lady's Mansion Is Exposed In The Panama Papers \\" April 4, 2016. Proceso also said that the Mexicans mentioned in the leaked documents included individuals linked to drug cartels.  Trinidad and Tobago  Ken Emrith, a member of the opposition United National Congress (UNC), is linked to a bribery scandal in Brazil through Panamanian shell companies used to transfer millions of US dollars to offshore bank accounts. The Brazilian construction company was awarded a contract in 2011 through the National Infrastructure Development Company (NIDCO) by the People's Partnership administration to build a highway in Trinidad for TT$5.2 billion.TT$1~US$0.16 as of April 15, 2016. The highway is 49% complete, but it is now estimated that the highway will cost TT$8 billion when done. Investigators have found that Emirth's companies received $6 million from NIDCO and that Emirth was also a director of Pembury Consultants (Trinidad and Tobago) Limited, which OAS hired on the highway project as a consultant at $44,800 a month. Through May 2013 OAS paid Pembury at least TT$896,000; totals beyond that date are not currently available. Emrith, described as a low-level UNC party official, had a second Mossack Fonseca company, Pendrey Associates. Speaking in Parliament, Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi said the leaked documents tied this offshore company to key players in the Petrobras scandal in Brazil, including the convicted , and Jose Luiz Pires of Queluz, who had dealings with Swiss AG. Pires is under investigation, he said. According to ICIJ investigative partner Trinidad Express, Emrith was a close associate of Jack Warner and also owns half the shares in Proteus Holding SA, an investment he refuses to discuss because he says he has a responsibility of confidentiality to fellow shareholders. The Express also says that OAS used a Namibian port development project as camouflage for a $1 million payment from Procopio shell company Santa Tereza Services Ltd to Emirth.  United States  President Barack Obama was critical of Caribbean tax havens in his 2008 election campaign. In 2010, the United States implemented the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act; the law required financial firms around the world to report accounts held by US citizens to the Internal Revenue Service. The US on the other hand refused to sign on to the Common Reporting Standard set up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, alongside Vanuatu and Bahrain. This means the US receives tax and asset information for American assets and income abroad, but does not share information about what happens in the United States with other countries, which in other words means that the United States has become attractive as a tax haven. At least 2,400 US-based clients were found in the papers; while many of their transactions were legal, Mossack Fonseca offered advice to many of its US clients on how to evade US tax and financial disclosure laws.ERIC LIPTON and JULIE CRESWELL (June 5, 2016) Panama Papers Show How Rich United States Clients Hid Millions Abroad The New York Times, Retrieved June 6, 2016. On 7 February 2020, federal prosecutors announced that they will obtain their first conviction in relation to the disclosures. On 18 February 2020, Harald Joachim von der Goltz, an 82 year old former businessman and former U.S. resident who was a client for Mossack Fonseca, pleaded guilty to nine counts, including charges of conspiracy to evade taxes and commit money laundering and wire fraud. He is the first to plead guilty in the U.S. in connection to the Panama Papers leak. On February 28, 2020, a Massachusetts accountant, Richard Gaffey, became the second person to plead guilty to charges related to the Panama Papers. Judgments against both von der Goltz and Gaffey were delivered in September 2020 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, resulting in 87 months imprisonment and over $17.7 million in asset forfeitures, restitutions, and fines between the two defendants. = Panama Free Trade Agreement = The Panama Free Trade Agreement, supported by Obama and Clinton, has been accused of enabling the practices detailed within the Panama Papers through regulatory oversight. However, an Obama administration official said the argument has \\"zero merit\\". John Cassidy of The New Yorker, said the Panama Free Trade Agreement actually forced Panama to release information to the American regulatory authorities on \\"the ownership of companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, and other persons\\". Citing leaked diplomatic cables, Fortune writer Chris Matthews speculated that Obama and Clinton may have supported the agreement, after opposing it while campaigning for office, because it was a quid pro quo for Panamanian support of US efforts against drug trafficking. In any event, he notes, while it is true that the agreement abolished limits on fund transfers between the US and Panama, the Obama administration insisted that the two countries first sign a Tax Information and Exchange Agreement as well, which facilitated the exchange of tax information between the countries. = After the leak = President Barack Obama addressed the overseas shell companies listed by the leak in a press conference: \\"It's not that they're breaking the laws,\\" he said, \\"it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by.\\" Although no leader in the US was mentioned in the Panama Papers, Obama said that \\"Frankly, folks in America are taking advantage of the same stuff\\". Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren have requested that the Treasury Department investigate any US-linked companies that appeared in the leaks, in addition to the Justice Department, given its role in the financial markets. Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton condemned \\"outrageous tax havens and loopholes ... in Panama and elsewhere\\" at a Pennsylvania AFL‚ÄìCIO event. Clinton added that \\"some of this behavior is clearly against the law, and everyone who violates the law anywhere should be held accountable\\", but it was \\"scandalous how much is actually legal\\". Clinton promised that \\"We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America.\\" Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara has opened a criminal investigation on matters related to the Panama Papers and sent a letter April 3 to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) saying his office \\"would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak as soon as possible.\\" The ICIJ received many such requests from many countries and ICIJ Director Gerard Ryle has said its policy is not to turn over any materials.\\"NY banks ordered to provide information on Panama dealings\\" . Cura√ßao Chronicle. New York's Department of Financial Services has asked 13 foreign banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, Commerzbank AG, ABN Amro Group NV and Societe Generale SA, for information about their dealings with Mossack Fonseca. The banks are not accused of wrongdoing but must provide telephone logs and records of other transactions between their New York branches and the law firm. = Americans = McClatchy Newspapers initially found four Americans with offshore shell companies named in the documents. All had previously been either accused or convicted of financial crimes such as fraud or tax evasion. Three reasons have been suggested to explain the scarcity of Americans in the leak: * Shell companies can be created in the United States. * Major international banks based in America tend to have offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands instead. * US laws like the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) of 2010 have meant that the \\"tax evasion game [was] principally over for American taxpayers\\". Asked about the paucity of American individuals in the documents, digital editor of S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Stefan Pl√∂chinger, said via Twitter: \\"Just wait for what is coming next.\\" Pl√∂chinger later clarified that he was just advocating not jumping to conclusions. Copies of at least 200 American passports ‚Äì indicating that their owners applied for banking services ‚Äì have been discovered in the Papers, but no US politicians have yet been named in the leak. The names of a few Americans are however mentioned: * Puerto Rican recording artist Ram√≥n Luis Ayala, better known as Daddy Yankee, appears in the leaked documents. * CEO and then Chairman of Citibank (1998‚Äì2006) Sanford I. Weill appears in the documents as sole shareholder of April Fool, a company based in the British Virgin Islands that managed a yacht of the same name from 2001‚Äì2005. Weill's second company, Brightao, includes Chinese and American investors and holds share in a Chinese insurance and risk-management firm, Mingya Insurance Brokers. * Jerry Slusser, a fundraiser for Republican Mitt Romney, initially said he did not recall opening an offshore company, but then called his accountant and said it was for an investment in Hong Kong that eventually showed a loss. * Donors to former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, including Marc Rich and Ng Lap Seng. * Thousands of mentions of Donald Trump. Several \\"Trump\\" companies mentioned in the Panama Papers have completely different principals, such as \\"a young woman whose LinkedIn profile describes her as merchandising supervisor at a small clothing retailer\\" in Palembang, Indonesia. The \\"Trump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower Panama\\" mentioned in the papers \\"is not [now] owned, developed or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization or any of their principals or affiliates\\", according to the resort website. *Central Intelligence Agency operatives - a number of \\"front\\" companies and contractors for the CIA used \\"offshore companies for personal and private gain,‚Äù as well as employing them as instruments for their official work as ‚Äúspy chiefs, secret agents, or operatives.‚ÄùWill Fitzgibbon and Nicolas Richter: Panama Papers: CIA-Agents used companies from Panama Operation Goldfinger, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung Notes  References  Further reading *  External links  * A manifest by Panama Papers leaker * Panama Papers Portal of International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (US) * Panama Papers Portal of S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (Germany) * Panama Papers Portal of The Guardian (United Kingdom) * Panama Papers Portal of Financial Times (United Kingdom) * Panama Papers Portal of Le Monde (France) * Panama Papers Portal of Sveriges Television (Sweden) * Portal of the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) (Africa) * Panama Papers Portal of Inkyfada (Tunisia) * Panama Papers Portal of Semanario Universidad at the University of Costa Rica * Panama Papers Portal of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project * Panama Papers Portal of Le Desk (Morocco) * Panama Papers Portal of Reykjav√≠k Media (Iceland) * Panama Papers Portal of Armando.info (Venezuela) * New Zealand IR607:Foreign trust disclosure North America ","title":"Panama Papers (North America)"},{"id":"61775938","text":"Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the leak on April 15, 2016 (As of May 19, 2016) The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorney‚Äìclient information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source. This page details related allegations, reactions, and investigations, in Africa. Former South African president Thabo Mbeki, head of the African Union's panel on illicit financial flows, on April 9 called the leak \\"most welcome\\" and called on African nations to investigate the citizens of their nations who appear in the papers. His panel's 2015 report found that Africa loses $50 billion a year due to tax evasion and other illicit practices and its 50-year losses top a trillion dollars. Furthermore, he said, the Seychelles, an African nation, is the fourth most mentioned tax haven in the documents.  Algeria  Minister of Industry and Mines Abdeslam Bouchouareb has been sole owner of a Panamanian-registered offshore company known as Royal Arrival Corp since 2015. The company, active in Turkey, Great Britain and Algeria, is managed through Compagnie d'Etude et de Conseil (CEC), based in Luxembourg, and has an account in the Swiss NBAD Private Bank. CEC confirmed the ownership of Royal Arrival and said it managed the minister's inherited assets with transparency. Algeria estimates it has lost 16 billion dollars offshore between 2004 and 2014, a cause for concern given the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for 95% of Algeria's external revenue.  Angola  The Panama Papers exposed a link between an American oil company's oil concessions and several powerful politicians in Angola. According to the leaked documents approximately fifteen shell companies funneled money through UBS bank accounts to elites in Portugal with direct ties to Helder Bataglia dos Santos of Escom, which describes itself as one of the largest investors in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The account of one company, Markwell Inc, received and sent on over $12 million in 2008 and 2009. Petroleum Minister Jos√© Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos had power of attorney for an offshore company in 2002, when he became petroleum minister after previously being employed for a number of years as an executive at Sonangol, according to the leaked documents. He denies wrongdoing. ICIJ partner Le Monde says it has seen documents that show he was the proxyholder for Medea Investments Limited, founded in Niue in 2001, and moved to Samoa five years later. The company, which issued only bearer bonds, had a capitalization of $1 million, and closed in 2009. He has never previously been accused of corruption. Angola's $5 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA), promotes itself as a vehicle of development and prosperity for Angola. The FSDEA is headed by Jos√© Filomeno de Sousa \\"Zenu\\" dos Santos, the son of President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, who has been in power since 1979. Funded by the state-owned petroleum company Sonangol, the FSDEA has critics who say that its record-keeping is murky and that it seems to engage in nepotism and cronyism.  Botswana  Ian Kirby, head of the Court of Appeal, owns seven holding companies in the British Virgin Islands. He has said they were intended for investment, and lost money.  Republic of the Congo  In 2015, Congo produced 290,000 barrels of oil a day. Philia's attorney denied receiving advantageous pricing and said it only received 2.5% of Coraf oil. = Sassou-Nguesso = Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of Congo-Brazzaville Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso is the son of Denis Sassou Nguesso, in power for 32 years and re-elected in March in a disputed election. Daniel is a representative for Oyo, a member of the ruling Parti congolais du travail or Congolese Party of Labour. He is also the assistant director-general of the Soci√©t√© nationale des p√©troles du Congo (SNPC), and general manager of the national refinery, Coraf. According to leaked documents he had Mossack Fonseca establish a shell company in the British Virgin Islands for him named Phoenix Best Finance Ltd. His name also appears in 2002 as a director of Geneva-based Philia SA alongside oil merchant Jean-Philippe Amvame Ndong. He has denied all knowledge of any of these matters. According to Swiss non-profit Berne Declaration, Philia has an exclusive no-bid contract for Congolese oil exports from the Coraf refinery, and for the last three years the country has not received any payment at all for oil shipped to the refinery. = Bruno Itoua = Bruno Itoua was the president's advisor on oil and director-general of the SNPC until 2005. A US federal court found that he diverted funds to fictitious companies, but he nonetheless became minister of energy. Panama Papers documents seen by Le Monde reveal he has also held the power of attorney since 2004 for Denvest Capital Strategies and Grafin Associated SA, registered by Mossack Fonseca in Panama and the British Virgin Islands. Itoua is currently minister for scientific research.  Democratic Republic of Congo  Laurent- D√©sir√© Kabila's son and successor, Joseph Kabila From 1999 to 2002, the Kabila regime \\"transferred ownership of at least $5 billion of assets from the state- mining sector to private companies under its control ... with no compensation or benefit for the State treasury\\", a United Nations investigation found. The US Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help bring about the end of conflict diamonds and minerals in the US. The idea was that public opinion would force divestment over time. Section 1502 does not require divestment, but does mandate disclosure. But instead the disclosure requirement has simply meant new business opportunities for money launderers. As recently as 2014 the UN found that 70 percent of DRC gold was sold in Dubai without any problem, while gold continued to provide important funding for both the army and armed rebel groups. = Dan Gertler and Beny Steinmetz = In March 2005, Dan Gertler International formed a new company, Global Enterprises Corporate (GEC), with Global Resources, owned by Beny Steinmetz. A former DRC mines minister, Simon Tuma-Waku, was \\"special adviser\\". The company formed a joint copper and cobalt mining venture with DRC agency La G√©n√©rale Des Carriers et Des Mines (G√©camines), which held 25%, and GEC 75%, which they placed into an Isle of Man holding company, Nikanor plc. The IPO raised ¬£400 million in London and the company eventually reached a market capitalization of $1.5 billion for an initial investment of $3 million. * In January 2010 G√©camines revoked a joint venture contract for the Kingamyambo Musonoi tailings copper project with First Quantum Minerals, a Canadian company which had spent $750 million on a treatment plant at the site. * A majority stake was then sold to Highwinds Group, which paid $60 million and turned out to be owned by Gertler. * Gertler sold Camrose, another offshore company that owned Highwinds, to a Kazakhstan entity for $689 million. * A lawsuit, First Quantum vs Highwinds and others, subsequently recovered more than a billion dollars. Steinmetz appears in 282 leaked documents; Gertler of Dan Gertler Inc, who had ties to Joseph Kabila and his closest aide, more than 200. The presidential decree that ratified the agreement was issued despite the recommendation against it by the anti- corruption Lutundula Commission. = Jaynet D√©sir√©e Kabila Kyungu = According to the Panama Papers, Kabila's twin sister owns part of an offshore company with interests in Congo that include a part of mobile-phone company Vodacom Congo. The government called a press conference to warn journalists against printing the names of any Congolese figures that might appear in the documents. Kabila's sister, Jaynet D√©sir√©e Kabila Kyungu and Feruzi Kalume Nyembwe, an advisor to their late father and former president Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila are both directors of Keratsu Holding Limited, a company registered in Niue through Mossack Fonseca a few months after the elder Kabila's assassination. Keratsu held 19.6% of the shares in Congolese Wireless Network, which held 49% of Vodacom Congo. = Lucien Ebata = Lucien Ebata, a Kinshasa businessman, runs Orion Group SA, registered in the Seychelles in 2009 by Mossack Fonseca through the Luxembourg-based Figed, according to the Panama Papers. Ebata, who receives a salary of a million dollars, does a business volume of around a billion, and counts both Shell and the Soci√©t√© nationale des p√©troles du Congo (SNPC) among his customers.  Dubai  In theory American and European buyers of gold in Africa are required to review their supply chain and report any use of conflict resources, such as gold from eastern Congo. In practice the requirement is widely ignored, and an investigation by African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) found examples in the leaked Mossack Fonseca documents of anonymous shell companies doing the sourcing. For a start, most of the DRC gold winds up in Dubai by way of Uganda. Dubai's $75 billion gold industry is regulated with a very light hand by the quasi-private Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC). Kalotti, which exports about 40% of Dubai's gold, bought about $5.2 billion in gold in 2012 with little to no paperwork, according to Ernst & Young partner Amjad Rihan. Rijan has said that both the DMCC and his employer squashed his concerns, and the DMCC changed its audit procedures to ensure a more favorable outcome in the future. ANCIR journalists obtained records showing that Kalotti has sold \\"scrap gold\\" to other refiners including Valcambi. Leaked documents show PAMP Holding Mauritius signed an agreement with MKS Holding BV and two shell companies described as its beneficial owners: Panama-based Mountside Investment and Hong Kong-based Dynamic Bonus Limited. In 2010 MKS Holdings owned 72% of a joint venture between MMTC Ltd., owned by the State of India, and Switzerland's PAMP. This joint venture does supply big multinationals like Apple.  Egypt  Alaa Mubarak, son of former president Hosni Mubarak, was cited as owning, through holding companies, real estate properties in London. The assets of his Virgin Islands-registered firm Pan World Investments were frozen in response to a European Union order when his father stepped down in 2011 during the Arab Spring. Mossack Fonseca was fined $37,500 in 2013 for lack of due diligence. Alaa and his brother were convicted last year of embezzling state funds and still face trial for insider trading. Egyptian businessmen Mohamed Abu El-Enein, Ahmed Bahgat, Ashraf Marwan, Ibrahim Kamal, Mohamed Nosseir, Mohamed Mansour, Raouf Ghabbour, and Mohamed Al-Maghraby are all named in the leaked documents, as well as the Orascom Development Holding company, headed by Samih Sawiris, and also the Bank of Alexandria, Banque Misr, and Banque du Caire. Former Sudanese President Ahmed al-Mirghani was a client of Mossack Fonseca also. Al-Mirghani lived in Egypt after the 1989 coup that ended his presidency and was active in the Democratic Unionist Party. Orange Star Corporation bought a long-term lease in a tony London neighborhood near Hyde Park for $600,000 the same year al-Mirghani created it, and at the time of his death held assets worth $2.72 million.  Gabon  Every Ramadan he fed 500 people; he financed about 20 pilgrimages to Mecca every year. Described as a billionaire, Seydou Kane holds diplomatic passports from Senegal, Gabon and Mali. The protocol officer of the Senegalese Embassy in Paris was waiting for him when his plane landed at Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle in November 2015. But Kane, a close associate of the Gabonese ruling family, was questioned and jailed in Nanterre for ten hours by anti-corruption agents in connection with an investigation opened in July 2007. In January 2013 Kane was briefly questioned while in transit to Miami at Le Bourget by French authorities whose curiosity was piqued by ‚Ç¨2.5 million cash he had on his person. According to Senegalese daily Lib√©ration, the money-laundering unit Tracfin became interested in 2006 in a ‚Ç¨300,000 payment from Groupe Marck, a French company specializing in military uniforms and anti-riot gear, to a Monaco-based entity called Citp. Citp was managed by Kane, a close friend of the president's chief of staff, Maixent Accrombessi, himself held in Paris and interrogated in August 2015. French officials wanted to ask Accrombessi about a contract between Marck and the Gabonese Ministry of the Interior for ‚Ç¨7 million. The head of Marck, Philippe Belin, was also held and questioned. The investigation was assigned to , who also conducted the so-called \\"ill-gotten goods\\" investigation, which targeted a number of African leaders including the father and predecessor of Ali Bongo Ondimba, the current president of Gabon. Mossack Fonseca opened two holding companies for Kane in 2013 and 2014: Maxi Gold International Limited and Smart Key LTD, which according to their paperwork traded in sundries on the one hand and gym equipment on the other.  Ghana  John Agyekum Kufuor, former President of Ghana John Addo Kufuor, son of John Agyekum Kufuor, had Mossack Fonseca manage his trust starting in 2001 when his father took office. The trust held $75,000 in a bank account in Panama; his mother was also a beneficiary. He was linked to two other offshore companies also registered during his father's term. They are now inactive. Kojo Annan, son of former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, appears with Laolu Saraki, the son of the late Nigerian senator Abubakar Olusola Saraki, as shareholders in Blue Diamond Holding Management Corp, registered by Mossack Fonseca in the British Virgin Islands in 2002. The two were directors of Sutton Energy Ltd, also registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2002, then transferred to Samoa. In 2015, Annan used another shell company first registered in the British Virgin Islands, then transferred to Samoa, to purchase an apartment in London for $500,000.  Guinea  In 2008‚Äì2009, the Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR) and its owner Beny Steinmetz paid just $165 million for the mining rights to the northern portion of Simandou mine, located in the Nz√©r√©kor√© region of Guinea's interior. Soon after, he sold 51 percent of the rights to Vale for $2.5 billion. Rio Tinto, which had previously held the concession, had invested $450 million into infrastructure at the site. Global Witness says BSGR in fact paid nothing for the rights, and the $165 million represents BSGR's self-reported investment in improvements at the site. It adds that either way BSGR's profit exceeded the national budget of Guinea. US authorities say that Steinmetz paid Mamadie Tour√© $5.3 million for her help in obtaining the concession from her husband Lansana Cont√©, president of Guinea, shortly before he died. According to Global Witness, an offshore company belonging to Tour√©, Matinda, received a payment of $2.4 million from a company named Pentler Holdings. Several more payments were promised as well as 5% of BSGR shares in Simandou. Pentler owned 17.65% of BSGR Guinea. Guinean President Alpha Cond√© launched an investigation after he was elected in 2010. Separately, so did the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US justice department, suspecting violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In August 2014 Mossack Fonseca received a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) notice from the US government inquiring into ownership of Pentler and two other BSGR companies administered by Mossack Fonseca's Geneva office. However, the president of Pentler's financial management firm, Menachem Eitan, was a fugitive from the US SEC facing charges over a $55 million Ponzi scheme. Guinea's Mines Minister Mohamed Lamine Fofana said in 2012 that BSGR \\"didn't follow the law\\".  Ivory Coast  Jean-Claude N'Da Ametchi, an advisor to former president Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to accept that he lost an election in 2010, is also mentioned in the leaked documents. The European Union sanctioned banker N'Da Ametchi in 2011 for helping to finance the Gbagbo regime. His offshore company, Cadley House Ltd, was registered in the Seychelles with bearer bonds and a bank account in Morocco. N'Da Ametchi sent email in 2011 to the Geneva office of Mossack Fonseca, naming the Geneva bank Pasche financial managers of the company. In September 2012 he acted as sole director to request they transfer its registration to Abidjan. Neither Mossack Fonseca nor the banks mentioned the European sanctions; these were eventually lifted in 2012. The company was apparently still active in 2015, according to documents seen by Le Monde. He is currently an advisor to former prime minister Charles Konan Banny, who lost the October 2015 presidential election.  Kenya  Former Deputy Chief Justice Kalpana Rawal was a director or shareholder in four holding companies and was active in two after she took office. Her husband owns another seven. The companies were used for real estate transactions in Britain. Rawal and her husband were shareholders and directors of Highworth Management Services, where Ajay Shah, a former director of Trust Bank, was also a shareholder and director. The Central Bank of Kenya ordered Shah's assets auctioned to repay depositors after Trust Bank collapsed, but he went into hiding and the assets have not been recovered.  Morocco  Mounir Majidi, personal secretary of King Mohammed VI was designated in March 2006 as the representative of SMCD Limited created in 2005 through Geneva financial advisor Dextima Conseils. According to the ICIJ, through SMCD Majidi bought the \\"Aquarius W\\", a 1930s-era luxury sailboat, which was then registered in Morocco as \\"El Boughaz\\", belonging to the king. SMCD, according to the ICIJ, also made a loan to a Luxembourg company, Logimed Investissements Co SARL, for which details are not available. Following this loan, SMCD was liquidated in 2013.  Namibia  Sam Nujoma, former President of Namibia Diamond Ocean Enterprises, a Mossack Fonseca entity set up in 2005, reported its purpose as financial consulting to a Namibian diamond manufacturer and polisher. According to the law firm's records, Deutsche Investment Consultants (Asia) Limited, a Mossack Fonseca company set up in the British Virgin Islands for the now-imprisoned Mafioso Vito Palazzolo by Wolf-Peter Berthold, a German banker based in Hong Kong, is a director of the firm. Its shareholders include Peter von Palace Kolbatschenko, Palazzolo's son, Berthold, and Giovanni Agusta. Also in 2005, Zacharias (Zacky) Nujoma, youngest son of Sam Nujoma, set up two holding companies, Avila Investments and Marbella Investments, and licensed them to buy and cut diamonds. Shortly afterwards 90% of the stock was transferred to Diamond Ocean. In 2006 Nujoma established Ancash Investments, which obtained seven exclusive uranium prospecting licenses. Palazzolo loaned the company US$10 million. Canadian mining company announced it would partner with Ancash in its uranium contracts and said it based its decision in part on Ancash's strong international support in Natural Earth International Ltd. of Hong Kong. Natural Earth is another Deutsche Investment company.  Nigeria  \\"Corrupt officials have stolen $150 billion from Nigeria in the last 10 years,\\" said Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said April 7, 2016. He added that he planned to ask United States President Barack Obama for help. = Bukola and Toyin Saraki = President of the Nigerian Senate Bukola Saraki was found, through the Panama Papers leak, to have ties to at least four offshore companies he failed to declare to the Code of Conduct Bureau as Nigerian law requires. His wife Toyin also had shell companies listed in her name in the Mossack Fonseca documents: Girol Properties Ltd, Sandon Development Limited and *Landfield International Developments Ltd. Saraki has said that the assets in these holding companies belong to his wife's family and therefore he was not required to report them. ANCIR dismisses this because: # His close friend and aide is a shareholder in Sandon Development. # He has previously described himself, both in correspondence and in legal documents, as the shareholder of the Belgravia property owned by Sandon Development. # Toyin had her lawyers send a letter to ICIJ denying ownership of Girol Properties. However, leaked documents do link her to the firm. But a handwritten note suggests Mossack Fonseca was aware that she was a nominee director. = Aliko Dangote = Aliko Dangote, chief executive of the Dangote Group, is tied in the leaked documents to four offshore companies, and to as many as 13 if his family and business associates are included. Dangote, with an estimated $17 billion worth, is currently involved in the construction of a $14 billion oil refinery in Lagos. = James Ibori = Former Delta State governor James Ibori is also mentioned in the leak. Ibori pleaded guilty in London in 2012 to siphoning $75 million out of Nigeria while he was in office from 1999 to 2007. All charges against him in Nigeria had been dropped in Nigeria following an election. Ibori was sentenced to 13 years. Mossack Fonseca, the registered agent for his four offshore entities, received a request in 2008 for information about his accounts from British Crown Prosecutors. His family's Julex Foundation was the shareholder in Stanhope Investments, a company incorporated in 2003 on the island of Niue, to which he funneled millions of dollars so he could buy a private jet. The United Kingdom returned ¬£6.8 million to Nigeria from funds it had seized from accounts determined to have belonged to Ibori. The anti- corruption taskforce of the Olusegun Obasanjo government, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, questioned at the time whether the Yar'Adua administration has refrained or was loath to pursue members of the Nigerian elite suspected of corruption, including leading financiers of the ruling party, or those like Ibori who supported had their election. = David Mark = Former Senate President David Mark was also listed as owner of eight shell companies in the leaked Panama Papers: Sikera Overseas S.A., Colsan Enterprises Limited, Goldwin Transworld Limited, Hartland Estates Limited, Marlin Holdings Limited, Medley Holdings Limited, Quetta Properties Limited and Centenary Holdings Limited. = Hakeem Belo-Osagie = A portion of the wealth owned by former Chairman of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), Hakeem Belo-Osagie, is domiciled in trusts and shell companies in some notorious tax havens around the world.  Rwanda  The government of Rwanda uses an offshore company to lease a private jet for its senior politicians. Leaked documents show that Brigadier-General Emmanuel Ndahiro, using a London address, become a director of a British Virgin Islands company, Debden Investments Ltd. in 1998, owner of a jet aircraft. Ndahiro, a close advisor of president Paul Kagame, was then spokesman for Kagame's military. According to the Panama Papers the owner of the company was Hatari Sekoko, who ran a number of real estate and hotel ventures such as the Marriott in Kigali.  Senegal  = Karim Wade = Senegalese politician Karim Wade ICIJ partner Ouestaf.com was able to establish through the Panama Papers the existence of secret contracts between and DP World FZE (DP)and Mamadou Pouye, the bribery codefendant of Karim Wade, son of former prime minister Abdoulaye Wade. This information was not available at their trial; Ouestaf confirmed their financial ties to the corporation for the first time during the Panama Papers investigation. Wade was sentenced in 2015 to a six-year prison term by the Cour de r√©pression de l'enrichissement illicite (Crei), a specialized anti- corruption court. Wade was accused of illegally amassing assets of more than $240 million; and his childhood friend Pouye was sentenced to five years for allegedly helping him. Both denied wrongdoing and the United Nations and Amnesty International said their rights had been violated at trial. Ouestaf's investigation did not address the legality of their trial. It did conclude that they had succeeded in tracing a payment to Pouye's oversea shell company from a subsidiary of DP. Wade remains a member of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) and is still the PDS candidate for the 2017 presidential election. Mossack Fonseca documents show that Pouye owned three offshore companies, Seabury Inc, Regory Invest and Latvae Inc. * Through Seabury, a consulting contract worth ‚Ç¨7.2 million with DP World materialized. * A second contract for 2013‚Äì2015 was to focus on DP's African holdings, and would have paid Wade and Puye $3 million at signing; however the pair were arrested. Seabury seems to have been set up solely for doing business with DP World. It was started in 2008, a year after Senegal signed a contract with DP World for rights to the container terminal at the Autonomous Port of Dakar. In April 2009 Wade became minister of international cooperation, of territorial development, air transport and infrastructure, which he remained until his father's defeat by Macky Sall in the 2012 election. Regory Invest acted as a Seabury subcontractor, receiving ‚Ç¨65,000 a month, according to the documents. According to Ouestaf the documents make it clear that while Crei investigators were interested in the funds in Pouye's Monaco account, they did not know that their source was an offshore account he created himself. The two contracts prove that there was in fact a relationship between the defendants and DP World. Investigator Papa Alboury Ndao told the court in February that he had discovered two payments of $13 million each from a subsidiary of DP World FZE to a Singapore bank account belonging to Karim Wade. However the bank in Singapore refused to cooperate and Ndao was forced to drop that line of inquiry. = Others = Mossack Fonseca opened several offshore companies for multinationals. For example: Anglogold, owner of Anglogold Investments Senegal Ltd et Anglogold Exploration Senegal Ltd (both based in the British Virgin Islands). Senegalese architect Pierre Atepa Goudiaby, a special advisor to former president Abdoulaye Wade, is also mentioned in the leaked documents. The Swiss law firm Fidinam SA had Mossack Fonseca open the offshore Atepa Engineering Corp en 2006, the same year Goudiaby opened his Paris office on the Champs-Elys√©es.  Sierra Leone  The ICIJ investigation traces out many levels of offshore holdings in multiple countries related to the business dealings of Beny Steinmetz, with many serious findings such as a request that Mossack Fonseca backdate the revocation of a power of attorney. Mossack Fonseca records show that Sierra Leone diamond exporter Octea, based in the British Virgin Islands with the Steinmetz family as its beneficiaries, is wholly owned by Guernsey-based BSGR Resources, linked to a bribery scandal in Guinea. Foundations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, among them Nysco and Balda, own BSGR. In 2007, one of Nysco's bank accounts contained $27.7 million. Steinmetz, who has a personal fortune of $6 billion, supplies diamonds to Tiffany and DeBeers and is Sierra Leone's largest private investor. Yet, according to a detailed report in The Namibian, his Octea subsidiary owes, among other debts, property taxes of $700,000 to the city of Koidu. These unpaid taxes are discounted, according to mayor Saa Emerson Lamina, because Octea promised a 5% profit‚àísharing agreement, and payment 1% of its annual profit to a community development fund, but it did not do this either. Octea's subsidiary, Koidu Holdings, obtained the mine for $28 million, which was supposed to be a deposit, in 2002. Fighting had stopped in Sierra Leone, and the mine had previously been held and worked by South African firm Branch Energy, in payment for the services of its parent company, Executive Outcomes, \\"effectively...a military battalion for hire,\\" against rebel fighters in the area. Steinmetz has since put $300 million into the project. According to reporting by the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), the company produces 60‚Äì90% of Sierra Leone's diamond exports, and in some months between 2012 and 2015 exported more than US$330 million in rough diamonds. Octea owes US$150 million in unpaid loans. Although government records show taxes paid by other diamond companies, none are listed for Octea. The National Mineral Agency (NMA) until 2005 valued diamonds for export using a price book based on 1996 figures. Companies also often seek to minimize the value of their diamond exports to reduce taxes and move profits abroad. Once transferred to a subsidiary elsewhere where their value is not taxed, the same diamonds are frequently worth more. Diamonds from Koidu average $330 a carat, roughly 50% more than De Beers's Jwaneng mine in Botswana, the world's biggest. Tiffany has first pick of some of the best stones mined at Koidu and the remainder are sold to other trade buyers, according to Bloomberg. According to the World Bank, Sierra Leone for a long time based its growth forecasts on the success of two companies, one of which was Octea parent BSGR  South Africa  Two men linked to Fidentia, a South African asset management company that looted 1.2 billion rand from pension funds meant to provide for 46,000 widows and orphans of mineworkers, had accounts with Mossack Fonseca, which was willing to help hide the money even after South Africa made their names public. The former chief executive of Fidentia, J. Arthur Brown, was sentenced in 2014 to concurrent 15-year sentences. The FBI arrested one man, Steven Goodwin, in Los Angeles in 2008. Sent back to South Africa, Goodwin was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fraud and money laundering. The other, Graham Maddock, was also later jailed in South Africa for fraud. Khulubuse Zuma, nephew of South African President Jacob Zuma, has links in the documents to an offshore company with oil interests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He has denied any wrongdoing. According to leaked documents President Zuma also has ties to an oil mining deal between a British Virgin Islands-based oil company, Caprikat Limited, and Joseph Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and helped Caprikat obtain oil fields in the DRC then sent his nephew to the DRC to run the firm.  Sudan  Former President Ahmed al-Mirghani surfaced as a client of Mossack Fonseca. Al-Mirghani, who was president from 1986 to 1989, created Orange Star Corporation in the British Virgin Islands through the Panama firm in 1995, when he was living in Egypt after the coup that ended his presidency. He was active in the Democratic Unionist Party there. Orange Star Corporation bought a long-term lease in a tony London neighborhood near Hyde Park for $600,000 the same year al-Mirghani created it, and at the time of his death held assets worth $2.72 million.  Tunisia  The trial court prosecutor in Tunis ordered a judicial inquiry into the Panama Papers and Tunisian political figures suspected of hiring the firm. A judge from a Tunisian court specializing in financial crimes was assigned to the case. The Tunisian Assembly of the Representatives of the People established a parliamentary commission of inquiry as well Newspaper Inkyfada had access to the documents and reported a dozen politicians, former government officials and lawyers had been implicated, as well as a leading media figure. Monday April 4, 2016 it reported that the former secretary-general of the Nidaa Tounes political party, Mohsen Marzouk, who was also the coordinator of the new political party, Machrouu Tounes, was on the point of creating his own account in December 2014, in the first presidential elections. Marzouk had written Mossack Fonseca about a company in the Virgin Islands, emphasizing a desire to hold funds and conduct business overseas. Marzouk denies this and has filed a defamation complaint. Inkyfada was forced to briefly shut down its website following the report due to a cyberattack that attempted to insert names of politicians who had not been mentioned in the leaked documents.  Uganda  Mossack Fonseca documents provide new insight and confirmation for a previously-litigated tax case where an offshore company transferred its registration to avoid paying capital gains tax in Uganda. The documents show that Heritage Oil and Gas Limited (HOGL) knew in advance of a capital gains tax that Uganda planned to enact. HOGL was then operating in Uganda and planned to sell half its Ugandan assets. It \\"urgently\\" moved its registration from the Bahamas to Mauritius to avoid the tax. Mauritius has a double taxation agreement with Uganda, meaning that HOGL would pay tax in only one of the two countries. But Mauritius does not have a capital gains tax, so by moving there Heritage reduced its capital gains tax to zero. Emails clearly show that this was the reason for the transfer, although company attorneys deny it. In 2010, HOGL sold its 50 percent stake in Ugandan oil fields to Tullow Uganda for US$1.5 billion. The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) applied a US$404 million capital gains tax on the transaction and HOGL refused to pay. A four-year battle in various courts ensued. Ugandan officials, including President Yoweri Museveni and the then-URA Commissioner-General Allen Kagina demanded the payment from Tullow, threatening not to renew its exploration licenses, which were about to expire, unless it deducted the tax from its payment to Heritage and remitted it to the URA. Eventually Tullow made a down payment and deposited the rest in escrow, pending legal resolution of its appeal, which came in 2013. Tullow also successfully sued HOGL to recover taxes they had paid on its behalf. Heritage Gas and Oil is a subsidiary of Heritage Oil, founded by Conservative Party donor Tony Buckingham, who has given the party more than ¬£100,000. As of December 31, 2008, he still owned 33.1% of Heritage Oil. Uganda's ratio of tax to gross domestic product, at less than 14%, is one of the lowest in East Africa.  Zimbabwe  Mugabe An arms dealer and a mining tycoon with close links to President Robert Mugabe operated offshore companies despite US and European sanctions against them until 2013, more than four years after the sanctions were announced, according to the leaked documents. According to the Panama Papers, Zimplats Holdings, a large platinum mining concern, set up a shell company to pay the salaries of its senior managers. Zimplats denies knowledge of the company, HR Consultancy. The company, which was still active in 2015, was unknown to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which may indicate externalization of funds and tax evasion if, as it appears, the salaries were for citizens of Zimbabwe performing work in Zimbabwe.

Media =Television= She-Ra: Princess of Power (1985) In She-Ra: Princess of Power, Entrapta is the Horde's chief technician and a close sidekick of Catra. Entrapta is a skilled inventor and is credited with designing advanced equipment for the Horde to employ in their battle against the Great Rebellion. Her specialty is devising traps and weaponry. She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018‚Äì2020) In She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Entrapta is given an updated origin storyline. Her hair is also purple, unlike in the original show where it was pink, and she is able to mentally control it at will as if it were another appendage, manipulating it to fight enemies or to control her various machines. Showrunner Noelle Stevenson later confirmed that Entrapta was written as autistic. Entrapta is portrayed in the series as a skilled but reckless inventor and princess of Dryl. She has great interest in and studies robotics, and despite many failed experiments, she became one of the most knowledgeable people on First Ones' tech in Etheria. Entrapta quickly joins the Rebellion, though after a partially-botched rescue mission to the Fright Zone, she is nearly incinerated and left for dead by the other princesses. Convinced by Catra that she was abandoned by her friends on purpose, Entrapta is recruited into the Horde and creates highly effective weaponry for them. Entrapta bonds with Hordak, the leader of the Horde, over their shared interest in technology. Hordak reveals his nature as a defective clone to her, and due to Entrapta's love of imperfection, they form a genuine friendship that blossoms into love. However, when Entrapta refuses to activate a portal she and Hordak have been working on to summon the rest of the Horde to Etheria, Catra exiles her to Beast Island, and lies to Hordak that Entrapta betrayed him. Nonetheless, Entrapta is delighted by the ancient technology left on Beast Island. When Adora and Bow arrive to rescue Entrapta, she is reluctant to leave, due to both the island's resources and to her feelings of abandonment. With that despondency in mind, Entrapta almost allows herself to be consumed by the aggressive vegetation of the island. However, when She-Ra tells Entrapta that leaving with them would allow her to examine their aircraft, an item of ancient technology, Entrapta agrees to help them escape. In the end, Entrapta returns to the Rebellion. When the galactic Horde, led by Hordak's creator Horde Prime, arrives at Etheria, Entrapta proves to be instrumental in foiling his plan to use the planet's inner superweapon to destroy the universe. Hordak's love for Entrapta is shown to be strong enough that it inspires him to rebel against Horde Prime, and the two happily reunite after She-Ra disables the weapon and defeats Horde Prime. This version of Entrapta has received positive reception from critics. In other media Entrapta appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Slaughterhouse on the Prairie\\", voiced by Robin Tunney. She accompanies Catra and Scorpia into attacking Castle Bright Moon only for She-Ra to cause her breasts to explode.

Otto. Its main thesis is that the Greek religion was focused on the profundity of natural experiences, and therefore used less magical thinking than Asian religions, which tend to focus more on miracles. According to Otto, this reached its greatest expression in the works of Homer, where the Greek gods are portrayed as present in the natural world as particular forms of existence. The book has both been praised for its insights and larger arguments and criticized for its approach and errors. Otto's ontological approach to polytheism had an impact on a number of scholars and influenced the structuralist study of ancient religions.  Background  Walter F. Otto (1874 ‚Äì 1958) was a professor of classical philology at the University of Frankfurt. He belonged to the German philhellenic tradition of Winckelmann, Goethe, H√∂lderlin and Nietzsche. He was the main representative of a current in philology that stressed the existential and intuitive in the study of myths, which generated much enthusiasm in German academia in the 1920s and 1930s. It led to an ontological approach to understanding the gods, as opposed to understanding them as products of culture, history or society. Otto's fundamental views on religion were close to those of Ulrich von Wilamowitz- Moellendorff and Leo Frobenius. Otto was an anti-establishment conservative, held contact with the George-Kreis and understood his own works as part of an attempt to revitalize Europe. The Neue Deutsche Biographie describes his two major works from the Weimar Republic‚ÄîThe Homeric Gods (1929) and Dionysus (1933)‚Äîas not only contributions to the study of Greek religion, but also documentations of the religious studies in Germany during the Weimar era and its demise. The German title, Die G√∂tter Griechenlands, was borrowed from Friedrich Schiller's poem \\"Die G√∂tter Griechenlandes\\", published in March 1788 in Der Teutsche Merkur.  Summary  Otto writes that many people appreciate the lifelikeness and beauty of ancient Greek sculptures, yet will assess Greek religion as primitive or naturalistic, because they use oriental religions as the standard for measurement. Otto writes that the Greek religion should be examined on its own merits. Unlike Yahweh in the Old Testament, the gods in the Iliad and the Odyssey almost never perform miracles, but are present in experiences such as a clever thought, the awakening of enthusiasm and the ignition of courage. According to Otto, the Greek conception of divine power differed from the Asian in that it was not based on magical thinking, but saw the natural world in the light of the divine. This reached its greatest expression in the epic poetry of Homer, which Otto uses throughout to support his theses. Otto interprets Titans, Erinyes and Gorgons as remnants from an older religion, and contrasts these chthonic and grotesque beings with Homer's more humanlike Olympian gods. The difference is noticeable in comparisons with Hesiod, who retains many pre-Homeric features. The older deities are powerful through magic, whereas Homer's Olympians are powerful because they are connected to the being of nature. According to Otto, Homeric religion is expressed in the Apollon of Olympia, \\"a vivid representation of what is loftiest, most eminent, and at the same time brightest\\". Analysing the Homeric gods, Otto does not give Zeus a separate treatment, because all divinity converges in him. Athena belongs to the immediate present and the clarity of action, where she provides level-headedness, quick-wittedness and boldness for men, and skill in handicraft for women. Apollo and Artemis signify the distance between gods and humans and thus humanity's limitations. Apollo embodies the divine in self-knowledge, measure and intelligent order, and is associated with the sun, form and masculinity. His twin sister Artemis is associated with untouched nature, development and femininity; she teaches hunters, leads the way on journeys and presides over childbirth. Aphrodite is the goddess of rapture, spring and powerful yearning, and appears in prosperous sea journeys and blooming nature. Hermes is associated with luck, the nocturnal and travel, exhibiting the Olympian traits but also a connection to the pre-Homeric order of magic. Homer's gods are immortal, ageless, beautiful and tall. They reside in the aether but are present in the natural world. The presence of Poseidon, Hephaestus and Dionysus is limited in the epics, because Homer's gods are sublime entities who manifest their particular spirit in the totality of the world; they are not bound to elements, nor do they represent individual virtues or functions. They unify spirit and nature, which is reflected in Greek sculptures. Their connection to the natural world also explains their humanlike form, as humans are the highest natural forms. Homer's religion has a myth of the world as opposed to a myth of the soul: the gods provide depth and significance to humans who are active in the world. Free will is complicated because there is no logical border between human and divine activity. The favour of a god can be won through insight or a talent the god appreciates. When gods reveal themselves, it happens in ways that are outwardly natural, and the work of a god is sometimes not recognized as such until a poet points it out. By being timeless, the gods direct humans away from the personal and towards the essentiality of nature; their temper is always inclined to the general, impersonal and non-sensual. Ancient Greek poets honoured the divine in any eternal image of life, even if it was morally offensive. The gods have requirements, but those exist as living ideals, not moral laws. Fate, or Moira, is in Homer's works an impersonal order that limits life. The gods affirm life, allow human greatness and can intervene against avoidable acts, but they have no power over the unavoidable fate of death, and ultimately they always execute Moira's law.  Publication history  The first German edition of The Homeric Gods was published in 1929 by Friedrich Cohen in Bonn. The publisher had been responsible for several works by Otto's former teacher Hermann Usener, and for Platons Mythen (1927) by Karl Reinhardt, one of Otto's colleagues. Within its genre, The Homeric Gods was a success. By 1970 it had been published in six German editions without revisions and translated into multiple languages.  Reception  Martin P. Nilsson thought the book was delusional. Upon the original publication, Otto Weinreich wrote in the Frankfurter Zeitung that Otto \\"looks deeper and further\\" than Georges M√©autis and Tadeusz Stefan Zieli≈Ñski in two recent books that also reassess Greek religion. Weinreich wrote that the \\"one-sidedness\\" of Otto's book is both its strength and weakness, and that it brings up aspects that must be considered by everybody who studies ancient Greece. The philologist Martin P. Nilsson, who represented a rivaling approach where cult was placed at the centre of ancient theology, was highly critical in his 1929 review, railing against the mystic approach in Otto's book which he considered delusional. The British classical scholar H. J. Rose reviewed Moses Hadas' English translation in 1956. He noted a number of translation errors, and wrote about the book itself: \\"I find that a work, admittedly containing some good ideas here and there, which has so large a proportion of mere windy rhetoric and so many statements either certainly wrong or very doubtful (I noted about thirty) is but ill suited for the kind of reader the translator has chiefly in view.\\" Edith Hamilton on the other hand praised it for being \\"a book about the Olympians written with religious fervor.\\" In his book Greek Religion (1977), Walter Burkert wrote: \\"Die G√∂tter Griechenlands (1929) is a challenging attempt to take the Homeric gods seriously as gods, in defiance of 2,500 years of criticism: the gods enjoy an absolute actuality as Urph√§nomene in Goethe's sense of the term. This path, which ends in a sublime private religion, is not one which can be taken by everyone, but the work still radiates a powerful force of attraction.\\" In 2016, Carson Bay wrote in Reviews in Religion & Theology that the book contains much that is objectionable to scholars, but still, Otto's \\"arguments come from deep Homeric readings and, if it is easy to find particular points in which he errs, it is less easy to dismiss his larger arguments and descriptions. For classicists and religionists, this book presents a robust, even inspiring, macro-argument for understanding Homeric religion, and an opportunity briefly to glimpse a past when philologists wrote comfortably at the head of the 'theoretical' disciplines.\\"  Legacy  The Homeric Gods is Otto's most famous work and together with Dionysus his only work that scholars of classics still read with some regularity. With this and other books, Otto influenced a number of scholars and students, notably K√°roly Ker√©nyi. The ontological approach had an influence on the structuralist study of ancient polytheism and can be seen as a precursor to later ontological turns in anthropology.
