He spent his freshman year of college at the University of Idaho, transferred to the University of Montana-Missoula, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance in 1981. After discovering that the only employment he could get in Montana was a $10,000-a-year bank job, he took a position with Shell Oil in Houston, Texas, largely because a friend lived there. He later obtained a Master of Business Administration from the University of Houston. Williamson left Shell to work for Pan Energy Corporation. Pan Energy merged with the Duke Power Company in 1997 to become Duke Energy. Williamson rose to the position of President and CEO of Duke Energy Global Markets. In 2002, he was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Dynegy. As the CEO of Dynegy, Williamson received an award from the President's White Collar Task Force. Further, the former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, Michael Shelby, stated that Williamson becoming CEO, \\"has changed the standard operating procedures in such a way that honesty and candor [are] part of the business plan,\\" and Williamson \\"helped ferret out potential wrongdoers.\\" As the CEO of Dynegy, Williamson restructured Dynegy out of bankruptcy, and reduced Dynegy's outstanding debt by over $10 billion. Williamson resigned as CEO of Dynegy on February 10, 2011, after two takeovers over the company (both of which he supported) failed.\\"Dynegy's Top Executives to Resign in Wake of Failed Deals.\\" New York Times.

In his first year as CEO, he finalized the largest wholesale contract ever entered into for the Cleco Corporation by securing a 10-year contract with Dixie Electric Membership Corporation. In December 2013, Cleco Corp. transitioned into the Midcontinent Independent System Operator Market, with the hope that this will provide additional growth opportunities.

Comparing results from 2012 to 2011, Cleco reduced personal injuries by 33 percent and its avoidable accidents by 45 percent. Comparing results from 2012 to 2013, Cleco again improved its employee safety record by 20 percent and its avoidable accidents by 40 percent. Also, since Williamson joined Cleco, the company has raised shareholder dividends five times for a total increase of sixty percent. In 2014, Macquarie Group agreed to buy Cleco Corporation for approximately $3.4 billion in cash attracted by the steady, long-term returns of regulated power assets.

A top sheet, in the many countries where they are used, is a flat sheet, immediately under which bed occupants lie. A bottom sheet is laid above the mattress and bed occupants lie on it. A bottom sheet may be either a flat sheet, or a fitted sheet, which has been sewn to form a large pocket around the top, sides and bottom edge of a mattress, with elastic or a drawstring in the hem to stop it slipping off the bottom of the mattress. Blankets, quilts, duvets, comforters and other bed covers are laid over the top sheet. History The term bed sheet was first used in the 15th century. Bed sheets were traditionally white and made of linen, cotton or silk, but now various colors and patterns are used. Styles Assortment of different colored bed sheets Bed sheets come in two main varieties: flat and fitted. A flat sheet is simply a rectangular sheet of cloth, while a fitted sheet has its four corners, and sometimes two or four sides, fitted with elastic, to be used only as a bottom sheet. The fitted sheet may also be secured using a drawstring instead of elastic. The purpose of a fitted bottom sheet is to keep it from slipping off the mattress while the bed is in use. A particular way of folding and tucking while making the bed, known as \\"hospital corners,\\" is sometimes used when the bottom sheet is flat rather than fitted. Usually a flat bed sheet is overlocked around the edges to form four seams. One of the seams is wider than the other three and helps with orienting the sheet correctly on the mattress. The wider seam goes at the head end of the mattress. Sometimes the sides do not have seams, but are finished with the selvedge only. When placing a flat sheet on a bed, the manufacturer has designed the printed side to be softer, and thus it should be placed on the bed printed side \\"down\\". When folding back the covers, this also allows the printed side to show, for aesthetic purposes. When one makes a bed, the patterned or monogrammed side of the top sheet is placed facing down and then the top edge is folded towards the foot of the bed, exposing the design. In the US and Canada, sheets are often sold in a four-piece set consisting of a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and two pillowcases. In China, a four-piece set consists of a duvet cover, two pillowcases and either a fitted or flat sheet. Fitted Sheets are gaining popularity due to ease of use. Use of good quality elastic make fitted sheets durable. Materials Weavers work on a hospital bed sheet on a traditional manual loom in Faisalabad, Pakistan, in 2010 Cotton and cotton blends dominate the market. The most common blend being cotton and polyester. Cotton provides absorbency and a soft hand, while polyester adds durability and wrinkle resistance. Other common fibers used in the manufacturing of bed sheets include linen, silk, Modal and bamboo rayon, lyocell, and polypropylene. Polypropylene (olefin) is a hypoallergenic spun-bound material produced at a low cost and typically used in emergency shelters or hospitals as disposable sheeting. Construction The quality of bed sheets is often conveyed by the thread count‚Äîthe number of threads per square inch of material. In general, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the \\"hand\\" of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays a part in the look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 ply 300 thread count sheet will feel heavier than a single ply 600 thread count sheet. The most common constructions are muslin, percale, sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey. In a plain weave the warp and weft cross each other one at a time, and sateen, has multiple threads (usually three or four) over, and one under.

He is considered a pioneer in the amplification of the violin. Career Harris was born and raised in Pasadena, California. His parents were carnival entertainers. As a youth, he studied classical violin, and learned additional instruments including harmonica, piano and guitar. Harris began performing with a doo-wop group, The Squires, which included his childhood friend, the pianist Dewey Terry. The Squires recorded for Vita Records. Harris performed in Little Richard's band in the 1960s. =Don & Dewey = Harris and Terry formed a duo in 1956 as Don and Dewey. They were recorded by Art Rupe on his Specialty label, mostly utilizing the services of legendary drummer Earl Palmer. The duo also recorded on Rupe's other labels, Los Angeles Spot and Shade. Don & Dewey had no hits as an act, but several songs they co-wrote and recorded became early rock and roll classics for other musicians. These include \\"Farmer John\\" (the Premiers and, later, Neil Young), \\"Justine\\" (the Righteous Brothers), \\"I'm Leaving It Up to You\\" (Dale and Grace), and \\"Big Boy Pete\\" (the Olympics). Harris was given the nickname \\"Sugarcane\\" by bandleader Johnny Otis, due to his reputation as a ladies' man. =Frank Zappa and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers = After separating from Dewey Terry in the 1960s, Harris moved almost exclusively over to the electric violin. He reappeared as a sideman with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Frank Zappa, most recognized for his appearances on Hot Rats and on the Mothers of Invention albums Burnt Weeny Sandwich and Weasels Ripped My Flesh. His lead vocal and blues violin solo on a cover of Little Richard's \\"Directly from My Heart to You\\" on Weasels, and his extended solo on \\"Little House I Used To Live In\\" on Weeny are considered highlights of those albums. Zappa, who had long admired Harris' playing, reportedly bailed him out of jail, resurrecting his career and ushering in a long period of creativity for the forgotten violin virtuoso. He played a couple of live concerts with Zappa's band in 1970 and performed on four of Zappa's solo albums. =Pure Food and Drug Act = During the early 1970s, Harris led the Pure Food and Drug Act, which included drummer Paul Lagos, guitarists Harvey Mandel and Randy Resnick, and bassist Victor Conte, who was the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative. Conte replaced Larry Taylor, who was the original bass player. In the 1980s, Sugarcane was a member of the Los Angeles-based experimental rock band Tupelo Chain Sex.

Gibson criticized Holder's remarks as inappropriate. John Sanders, who at the time was technology reporter for WBAL- TV in Baltimore, then intentionally edited Gibson's remarks which had followed news reports of a monkey who had escaped from a Seattle zoo, making it appear that Gibson had compared Holder to a monkey \\"with a bright blue scrotum\\" on Fox. Sanders then posted the altered video on YouTube without a disclaimer that it was a joke. Because of this, the video was widely publicized on news websites, including The Huffington Post, as if it were authentic. Sanders was fired over the video, and Gibson said that the spread of the fake video has had a \\"personal\\" impact upon him. Books * Gibson, John.

It is named in honor of Alessandro Malaspina, a Tuscan explorer in the service of the Spanish Navy, who visited the region in 1791. In 1874, W.H. Dall, of what is now the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, bestowed the name \\"Malaspina Plateau\\" on it, not realizing its true geological character. It arises where several valley glaciers, primarily the Seward Glacier and Agassiz Glacier, spill out from the Saint Elias Mountains onto the coastal plain facing the Gulf of Alaska between Icy Bay and Yakutat Bay. Although it fills the plain, nowhere does it actually reach the water and so does not qualify as a tidewater glacier. The Malaspina is up to thick in places, with the elevation of its bottom being estimated to be as much as below sea level.http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_9/GEO_PLATE_G-7.shtml There are two lakes on its margins: Oily Lake to the northwest, at the foot of the Samovar Hills between the Agassiz and Seward glaciers, and Malaspina Lake to the southeast, close to Yakutat Bay. Radar data and aerial photographs dating back to 1972 provide evidence that the Malaspina-Seward glacier system lost about of its thickness between 1980 and 2000; because the glacier is so large, that amount of shrinkage was sufficient to contribute 1/2 of one percent of the rise in the global sea level.Rozell, 2000 Nearly all of the glacier is encompassed by the southeast lobe of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.

It is also a key figure with regard to hedge funds and venture capital funds when calculating the value of the underlying investments in these funds by investors. This may also be the same as the book value or the equity value of a business. Net asset value may represent the value of the total equity, or it may be divided by the number of shares outstanding held by investors, thereby representing the net asset value per share. Generally Net asset value and other accounting and recordkeeping activities are the result of the process of fund accounting (also known as securities accounting, investment accounting, and portfolio accounting). Fund accounting systems are sophisticated computerized systems used to account for investor capital flows in and out of a fund, purchases and sales of investments, and related investment income, gains, losses and operating expenses of the fund. The fund's investments and other assets are valued regularly; daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the fund and associated regulatory or sponsor requirements. There is no universal method or basis of valuing assets and liabilities for the purposes of calculating the net asset value used throughout the world, and the criteria used for the valuation will depend upon the circumstances, the purposes of the valuation, and any regulatory and/or accounting principles that may apply. For example, for U.S.-registered open-ended funds, investments are commonly valued each day the New York Stock Exchange is open, using closing prices (meant to represent fair value),AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide - Investment Companies May 1, 2007. typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. For U.S.-registered money market funds, investments are often carried or valued at \\"amortized cost\\" as opposed to market value for expedience and other purposes, provided various requirements are continually met. The Securities and Exchange Board of India issued a notice on 17th September 2020 stating that when purchasing mutual fund units before 1:00 PM the NAV from the day of realization (day when investment money reaches the AMC) will be applicable irrespective of the size of investment. At the completion of the valuation process and once all other appropriate accounting entries are posted, the accounting books are \\"closed\\", enabling a variety of information to be calculated and produced including the net asset value per share. Open-ended funds Net asset value is commonly used in the context of open-end funds. Shares and interests in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by the fund to each new investor and redeemed by the fund when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and redeem shares and interests at a price calculated by reference to the NAV of the fund, with the intention that new investors receive a fair proportion of the fund and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion of the fund's value in cash. For example, if a fund has a NAV of $200 million and 1 million shares in issue on a certain day, the \\"NAV per share\\"‚Äîthe price at which shares are issued‚Äîis $200. A person investing $40 million on that day will therefore be given 200,000 shares. Immediately following his investment the total NAV of the fund will be $240 million, as the new investor's cash becomes part of the fund and is available for investment by the fund. The investor will then be entitled to 1/6 of whatever the fund's value is when he withdraws his investment, if in the meantime his 1/6 ownership is not altered by any further withdrawals or investments to the fund. The valuation of the assets and liabilities of an open-ended fund is therefore very important to investors. If the NAV in the above example had, with the same assets, been calculated as $160 million (and the NAV per share as $160), the investor would have been given 250,000 shares and would become entitled to 1/5 of the fund's value. In contrast, closed-end funds are traded in the open market between investors and so the price of shares or interests in a closed-end fund will be whatever the parties agree it to be, which may not correspond to the fund's NAV. Publicly traded shares in such funds generally trade at a price below NAV. = Inaccuracies and risks = Mutual fund set their net asset value based on daily pricing using the end of the day price, which can introduce inaccuracies. ETFs do not have this precise risk as the holdings are typically reported transparently, although large bid-ask spreads and premiums or discounts to NAV can occur. Mismarking the value of underlying securities can be a fraudulent activity which inflates returns and sets future investors up for losses. Valuation of assets in open-ended funds and hedge funds The NAV of a collective investment scheme (such as a U.S. mutual fund or a hedge fund) is calculated by reference to the total value of the fund's portfolio (its assets) less its accrued liabilities (money owed to lending banks, fees owed to investment managers and service providers, and other liabilities).CFA Institute. (2008). Derivatives and Alternative Investments. pg 177. Boston: Pearson Custom Publishing. . Calculation of the net asset value for a hedge fund, including the calculation of the fund's income and expense accruals and the pricing of securities at current market value, is a core fund administrator task, because it is the price at which investors buy and sell shares in the fund.Guide to Sound Practices for Hedge Fund Administrators The accurate and timely calculation of NAV by the administrator is vital.\\"Sound Practice Guidelines for Administrators of Alternative Funds including Experienced Investor Funds in the Isle of Man\\" In 2003, investors in Lancer Group sued hedge fund administrator Citco for allegedly knowingly disseminating \\"misleading\\" Net Asset Value (NAV) statements. Citco ultimately informed investors that it was resigning as administrator to Lancer's funds, but did not provide an explanation. While Citco pointed to the fact that it had sought statements from Lancer's board of directors as to the propriety of the valuations, Southern District of NY Judge Shira Scheindlin wrote: \\"Although these actions demonstrate Citco Group's questioning of the numbers, they could also be interpreted as Citco Group's efforts to shield its own involvement in the process\\". Ultimately, Citco settled with investors. The case of Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich (SDNY) is the major case relating to fund administrator liability for failure to handle its NAV-related obligations properly.\\"Madoff Anwar case, with $235 million in settlement monies, finally comes to a close\\"\\"The Citco Settlement And What Lies Ahead For PwC,\\" Law360. The defendants settled in 2016 by paying the Anwar plaintiffs $235 million. The court held in the case, prior to the settlement, that \\"it is reasonable to infer from Plaintiffs' allegations that the Administrators were aware that Plaintiffs would‚Äîand did‚Äîrely on their statements of the Funds' NAVs that were sent to the investors.... Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs allege a relationship between the investors and the Administrators that gives rise to a duty of care ....\\"Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich (SDNY) Businesses Turning to operating companies as opposed to investment companies (mutual funds), in determining whether shares in a public company are a cheap or expensive investment, one tool used by investors is a comparison of the company's current market capitalization (being the price at which the market values the company) with its NAV. The NAV may be below the market price for the following reasons: * Accounting principles and bases of presentation of amounts in financial statements differ worldwide, blurring the comparability of companies in various jurisdictions. Financial statement values are typically recorded based on their local jurisdiction's related principles of accounting, which affect all the remaining points below. * The current value of a company's assets likely differ from the historical cost reflected in the financial statements used in NAV calculations. * The NAV describes the company's current asset and liability position. Investors might believe that the company has significant growth prospects, in which case they would be prepared to pay more for the company than its NAV. * Certain assets, such as goodwill (which broadly represents a company's ability to make future profits), are not necessarily included on a balance sheet and so will not appear in an NAV calculation. A company's market value will not always be greater than its NAV. For example, analysts and management estimated that Liberty Media Corporation was trading for 30-50% below its net asset value (or \\"core asset value\\") in June 2007. Where a company's market value is lower than its NAV, it may be considered more profitable to wind the company down and sell off its assets individually rather than continue to run it as a going concern. In contrast to fund valuation, the assets of a company will generally be valued for the purpose of a NAV calculation using the book value, the historical cost, or the amortised cost of the company's assets, or an appropriate combination of the three. Real estate investment trusts NAV is one of the valuation indices of real estate investment trusts (REITs, pronounced \\"Reets\\"). NAV is normally quoted \\"per investment unit\\" where the value is divided by the number of total outstanding investment units. In simple terms, NAV is an adjusted net asset value reflecting the market values of real estate properties held by an investment corporation. The degree of premium/discount on individual investment unit prices relative to the per-unit NAV serves as the yardstick for assessment. The NAV index is synonymous to the adjusted price-to-book ratio in which factors such as unrealized losses/gains of owned properties and brand values are reflected. News companies such as PropertyMall typically report on a REIT's NAV when the company reports it. Variable insurance and variable annuity contracts Variable universal life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts often are structured somewhat similarly to mutual funds, and they may vary in value as securities and markets fluctuate. Typically, these insurance or annuity products issue \\"units\\" of ownership to policyholders/annuitants in exchange for their investment‚Äîsimilar to shares of a mutual fund. Also similar to a fund, the assets, liabilities, and net assets of these product entities are valued periodically, resulting in an asset unit value or AUV or UAV per share, which is similar to NAV for a fund.

She is known for making cookies with the elves, caring for the reindeer, and preparing toys with her husband. Origin The wife of Santa Claus is first mentioned in the short story \\"A Christmas Legend\\" (1849), by James Rees, a Philadelphia-based Christian missionary.James Rees, Mysteries of City Life, J. W. Moore, 1849, p. 1. In the story, an old man and woman, both carrying a bundle on the back, are given shelter in a home on Christmas Eve as weary travelers. The next morning, the children of the house find an abundance of gifts for them, and the couple is revealed to be not \\"old Santa Claus and his wife\\", but the hosts' long-lost elder daughter and her husband in disguise. Mrs. Santa Claus is mentioned by name in the pages of the Yale Literary Magazine in 1851, where the student author (whose name is given only as \\"A. B.\\") writes of the appearance of Santa Claus at a Christmas party: :[I]n bounded that jolly, fat and funny old elf, Santa Claus. His array was indescribably fantastic. He seemed to have done his best; and we should think, had Mrs. Santa Claus to help him.\\"Holiday Week\\", The Yale Literary Magazine, vol. 17, December 1851, p. 82. An account of a Christmas musicale at the State Lunatic Asylum in Utica, New York in 1854 included an appearance by Mrs. Santa Claus, with baby in arms, who danced to a holiday song.\\"Santa Claus\\", The Opal, vol. 4, no. 1, 1854, p. 27. A passing references to Mrs. Santa Claus was made in an essay in Harper's Magazine in 1862;\\"Editor's Easy Chair\\", Harper's, vol. 24, no. 141, February 1862, p. 411. and in the comic novel The Metropolites (1864) by Robert St. Clar, she appears in a woman's dream, wearing \\"Hessian high boots, a dozen of short, red petticoats, an old, large, straw bonnet\\" and bringing the woman a wide selection of finery to wear.Robert St. Clar, The Metropolites, New York: American News Company, 1864, p. 37CHICKEN POT PIE9. The keeper of the naughty- or-nice ledger in \\"Lill's Travels in Santa Claus Land\\", 1878 A woman who may or may not be Mrs. Santa Claus appeared in the children's book Lill in Santa Claus Land and Other Stories by Ellis Towne, Sophie May and Ella Farman, published in Boston in 1878. In the story, little Lill describes her imaginary visit to Santa's office (not in the Arctic, incidentally): :\\"There was a lady sitting by a golden desk, writing in a large book, and Santa Claus was looking through a great telescope, and every once in a while he stopped and put his ear to a large speaking-tube. :\\"Presently he said to the lady, ‚ÄòPut down a good mark for Sarah Buttermilk. I see she is trying to conquer her quick temper.‚Äô :‚Äú‚ÄòTwo bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue; he‚Äôll drive his mother to the insane asylum yet.‚Äô\\" Later, Lill's sister Effie ponders the tale: :Effie sank back in the chair to think. She wished Lill had found out how many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Claus‚Äîand had, in fact, obtained more accurate information about many things. Much as in The Metropolites, Mrs. Santa Claus appears in a dream of the author E. C. Gardner in his article \\"A Hickory Back-Log\\" in Good Housekeeping magazine (1887), with an even more detailed description of her dress: :She was dressed for traveling and for cold weather. Her hood was large and round and red but not smooth, ‚Äî it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted of a series of rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse. :Her outer garment was a bright colored plaid worsted cloak reaching to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit at the side of the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag ‚Äî I couldn't tell which ‚Äî was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant. Mrs. Claus proceeds to instruct the architect Gardner on the ideal modern kitchen, a plan of which he includes in the article.E. C. Gardner, \\"A Hickory Back- Log\\", Good Housekeeping, vol. 4, no. 6, January 22, 1887, p. 125. Illustration from Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh-Ride, 1889 Santa Claus' wife made her most active appearance yet by Katharine Lee Bates in her poem \\"Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride\\" (1889).Penne L. Restad, Christmas in America: A History, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 148. . Although Restad gives the publication year as 1899, most sources say the poem was published in 1889. \\"Goody\\" is short for \\"Goodwife\\", i.e., \\"Mrs.\\" \\"Goodwife\\" and \\"Goody\\", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. In Bates' poem, Mrs. Claus wheedles a Christmas Eve sleigh-ride from a reluctant Santa in recompense for tending their toy and bonbon laden Christmas trees, their Thanksgiving turkeys, and their \\"rainbow chickens\\" that lay Easter eggs. Once away, Mrs. Claus steadies the reindeer while Santa goes about his work descending chimneys to deliver gifts. She begs Santa to permit her to descend a chimney. Santa grudingly grants her request and she descends a chimney to mend a poor child's tattered stocking and to fill it with gifts. Once the task is completed, the Clauses return to their Arctic home. At the end of the poem, Mrs. Claus remarks that she is the \\"gladdest of the glad\\" because she has had her \\"own sweet will\\". In popular media Since 1889, Mrs. Claus has been generally depicted in media as a fairly heavy-set, kindly, white-haired elderly female baking cookies somewhere in the background of the Santa Claus mythos. She sometimes assists in toy production, and oversees Santa's elves. It is worth noting that, when not portrayed as white-haired or elderly, she is often shown to have red hair. This could be because red hair is the color that most commonly fades to white with age. She is usually depicted wearing a fur dress of red or green. Her reappearance in popular media in the 1960s began with the children's book How Mrs. Santa Claus Saved Christmas, by Phyllis McGinley. Today, Mrs. Claus is commonly seen in cartoons, on greeting cards, in knick-knacks such as Christmas tree ornaments, dolls, and salt and pepper shakers, in storybooks, in seasonal school plays and pageants, in parades, in department store \\"Santa Lands\\" as a character adjacent to the throned Santa Claus, in television programs, and live action and animated films that deal with Christmas and the world of Santa Claus. Her personality tends to be fairly consistent; she is usually seen as a calm, kind, and patient woman, often in contrast to Santa himself, who can be prone to acting too exuberant. =Literature= Mrs. Claus has appeared as a secondary character in children's books about Santa Claus and as the main character in titles about herself. * Mrs. Santa Claus, Militant (one-act play) by Bell Elliott Palmer, 1914 * The Great Adventure of Mrs. Santa Claus by Sarah Addington and Gertrude A.

Her first name is Anya. It was her idea to give presents only to good children. *In the 1993 movie The Nightmare Before Christmas, Mrs. Claus has a cameo appearance. She is seen in the kitchen of her and Santa Claus's home, preparing a lunch box and a vacuum flask for her husband to take to work. *The 2002 movie The Santa Clause 2 centers on Tim Allen's character being forced to marry in order to continue his role as Santa. The \\"Mrs. Clause\\" confirms why every Santa has had a Mrs. Claus, because it is part of the Santa Clause. He ultimately finds genuine love in Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), the principal of his son Charlie's school, and in The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause, she deals with being Mrs. Claus, having a baby, and being separated from her family. *Played by Miranda Richardson in the 2007's Fred Claus (2007) starring Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti. Her name is Annette. *In Arthur Christmas, Mrs. Claus' first name is Margaret and is the wife of Malcolm (the current Santa) and mother of both the title character Arthur and his older brother Steve. She is depicted as much more efficient than her husband. *Mrs Claus (played by Goldie Hawn) briefly makes an appearance at the end of the 2018 Netflix movie The Christmas Chronicles. =Television= Mrs. Claus played a major role in several of Rankin/Bass' Christmas specials. In Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), she is seen as pestering her husband to eat, lest he become a ‚Äúskinny Santa,‚Äù and in Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (a movie that unites characters from Rudolph and Frosty the Snowman, among other Rankin/Bass Christmas specials), Santa calls her \\"Jessica\\" at one point. In Santa Claus is Coming to Town (1970), she is introduced as a teacher named Jessica, who first meets Santa Claus (then known as Kris Kringle) as a young man, when he's trying to illegally deliver toys to a town run by a despotic ruler. She assists him, and thus becomes a wanted fugitive herself with Kringle and his confederates. In light of this sacrifice, Jessica and Santa soon fall in love with each other, and marry in the nearby forest. In 1974's The Year Without a Santa Claus and the 2006 live action remake, Mrs. Claus played a large role, as she attempts to show Santa (who wishes to stay home that year for Christmas when he feels no one appreciates or believes in him anymore) that there's still some Christmas spirit left in the world. Mrs. Claus also made appearances in several other Rankin/Bass specials. The lady was also portrayed in a television musical, Mrs. Santa Claus (1996), played by Angela Lansbury, with songs by Jerry Herman. Neglected by her husband, she goes to New York in 1910, and gets involved in agitating for women's rights and against child labor in toy manufacturing. Of course, she gets to learn how \\"Santa misses Mrs. Claus\\", as the sentimental song lyrics have it. She goes by the name of Anna. One of Mrs. Claus's most unusual television appearances is in The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy Christmas special Billy and Mandy Save Christmas. In this story her name is Nancy and she is a powerful vampiress who, angry that Santa leaves most of the work for her, turns him into a vampire so she can take a break (which is about the six or seventh time she's done so), when she gets the idea from Mandy to try and take over the world before Billy reconciles them. Another unusual appearance is in the Robot Chicken Christmas Special, during which, in a Dragon Ball Z parody sketch, she gains powers from the North Pole's radiation, and becomes a giant monster that Goku, Gohan, and Rudolph must destroy. In A Charlie Brown Christmas, Charlie Brown's sister Sally writes to Santa and asks, \\"How is your wife?\\" Later, in It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown, she writes Santa's wife herself, and, when Charlie Brown comments that some people call her \\"Mary Christmas,\\" Sally congratulates her on choosing to keep her own surname. In Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales, Sally writes Santa Claus as \\"Samantha Claus\\", inadvertently thinking Samantha Claus is Santa Claus's wife. Mrs. Claus appears in A Chipmunk Christmas, where she buys Alvin a harmonica after he gives his old one to a sick boy. Her identity isn't revealed until the end, when Santa returns home and she greets him. Boost Mobile created some controversy with an ad featuring Mrs. Claus in bed with a snowman. One version was briefly aired on late-night TV while two alternate versions were posted online. Ad Age had some commentary about the spot, including ‚ÄúThis latest ad from Boost Mobile and agency 180, Los Angeles, features Mrs. Claus doing something very, very bad.\\" Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly, CNN and a number of local TV news channels commented about the ads. = Marks & Spencer 2016 Christmas Campaign = For 2016, British clothing and food company Marks & Spencer launched an integrated marketing campaign centered on a modern interpretation of Mrs. Claus. The campaign included a three-minute ad released on 11 November 2016 which sees Mrs. Claus receiving a letter from a seven-year-old child asking for help with a gift for his older sister, whom the boy has a difficult relationship with. The ad depicts Mrs Claus as more modern than previous examples, with her riding a snowmobile and flying a helicopter while Santa is out delivering gifts in the traditional sleigh. At the conclusion of the ad, she says to Santa ‚ÄúWell it wouldn‚Äôt be fun if you knew all my secrets‚Äù suggesting she has a secret life assisting with Christmas present delivery. The brand also created a social media campaign in which Mrs. Claus answered requests and questions from members of the public. The ad was received positively by customers and the press with many people commending the brand for taking a feminist approach to a traditional character. The ad was directed by Academy-award winner Tom Hooper with Mrs Claus played by British actress Janet McTeer. Music was composed by Rachel Portman. The ad was created for Marks & Spencer by advertising agency Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe, a London- based division of Young & Rubican. =Music= In 1953 Nat King Cole had a single released, \\"The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot\\", featuring on the flipside his rendition of a song, \\"Mrs. Santa Claus\\", with accompaniment by Nelson Riddle's orchestra. In contrast to her stereotypical portrayal, Mrs. Claus is portrayed as a woman bored with her relationship with Santa Claus in the song \\"Surabaya-Santa\\" from Jason Robert Brown's musical Songs for a New World and in the Oszkars' off-color song \\"Mrs. Claus has a Headache Again\\". In 1971, comedy duo Cheech and Chong released their take on Mr. and Mrs. Claus in a skit entitled \\"Santa Claus and His Old Lady,\\" in which Cheech is trying to write his version of a classic Hispanic Christmas song, and explains (in his own way) the origin of Santa and Mrs. Claus to his always-stoned friend, Chong. In 1987, George Jones and Tammy Wynette released a single, \\"Mr and Mrs Santa Claus\\", a love song sung by Jones and Wynette as Mr. and Mrs. Claus respectively. Bob Rivers recorded a parody of the soul song \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\", entitled \\"Me and Mrs. Claus\\", on his 2002 album White Trash Christmas. Bob Ricci recorded a parody of the pop hit \\"Stacy's Mom\\", entitled \\"Mrs. Claus\\". =Video games= * In Saints Row IV How the Saints Saved Christmas DLC, Mrs. Claus appears along with her husband. Her first name is revealed to be Mary. While she is mostly Santa's sweet, caring, and devoted wife, she is also a tough, capable fighter (\\"decking the halls\\" as Santa puts it), and unlike her husband quick to reveal the truth behind the nature of the \\"North Pole\\", the changes in to standards of what is considered Naughty, what happened the one time Santa let someone else drive the sleigh with his reindeer, among other things. Her personality and attitude earn Mrs. Claus some respect from the Saints Boss. * In \\"The Simpsons Tapped Out\\", during the 2017 Christmas event, \\"The Invasion Before Christmas\\", Kodos disguises herself as Mrs. Claus. In an effort to take over Christmas after being left out of Halloween, the Rigelian duo, Kang and Kodos, steal the identity of Santa and his wife. As the final prize of act one of the event, the skin, \\"Mrs. Kodos Claus\\", is unlocked by collecting 17,700 Rigellian Batteries. The costume portrays Mrs. Claus in a red, short sleeved outfit with glasses, slightly uneven lipstick, and a white mop hat. Upon unlocking the skin, the quest line, \\"Claus-Et Homemaker\\", activates, in which Mrs. Kodos Claus attempts to impersonate Mrs. Claus by doing housewife-esque things, such as baking cookies and cleaning the house. Not being skilled in any of these areas, she inevitably fails and gives up, turning to day drinking. By the end of the questline, she hires a maid, Shauna, to clean the house. Having fully satirized a lazier modern housewife, Mrs. Kodos Claus eventually murders Shauna and uses her skull as a Holiday decoration. * In Temple Run 2, as a portrayed gameplay character, which has been made in the celebration of Christmas.

Control of the railway was acquired on May 10, 2004, by the Canadian National Railway (CN) when it purchased the assets of Great Lakes Transportation.  History  DMIR ore docks loading ships, circa 1900‚Äì1915. The DM&IR; was formed by the merger in 1937 of the Duluth, Missabe and Northern Railway (DM&N;) and the Spirit Lake Transfer Railway. The following year, the Duluth and Iron Range Rail Road (D&IR;) and Interstate Transfer Railway were added. All of these had been leased by the DM&N; since 1930. The D&IR; was formed in 1874 by Charlemagne Tower to haul iron ore from the Minnesota Iron Co. in Tower, Minnesota, to the new Lake Superior port of Two Harbors, Minnesota. On July 31, 1884, the D&IR; carried its first ore shipment from the Soudan Mine. In 1887, the D&IR; was acquired by Illinois Steel Company, which itself became part of the new United States Steel Corporation (USS) in 1901. After high-grade Mesabi iron ore was discovered near Mountain Iron, Minnesota by the Seven Iron Men, the D&IR; was asked to build a branch line to serve this area, but declined. So in 1891, the Merritts incorporated the DM&N;, which shipped its first load of iron ore to Superior, Wisconsin, in October 1892. The following year, the Merritts expanded the DM&N; by laying track to Duluth, Minnesota, where they built an ore dock. But this expansion left the Merritts on shaky financial ground, and in 1894, John D. Rockefeller gained control of the railway. In 1901, Rockefeller sold the DM&N; to USS. From 1901 to 1938, the two railways were owned by USS and operated separately. Total ore hauled by the two railroads peaked in 1929 at 27.8 million tons (long tons of 2240 lbs) and dropped to 1.5 million tons in 1932. = Merger = One of the DM&IR;'s 2-8-8-4 locomotives preserved in Two Harbors, Minnesota Caboose C-74, built in 1924, operating in train service at Mid- Continent Railway Museum. By July 1938, the two railways merged to form the DM&IR.; The two operating divisions, the Missabe and the Iron Range, were based upon the predecessor roads. As the United States began to prepare for the Second World War, the iron ore tonnage moving over the Missabe Road accelerated from a little over 8 million tons in 1938, past 18 million tons in 1939, then to almost 28 million tons in 1940 and past 37 million tons in 1941. The first eight of DM&IR;'s class M 2-8-8-4 Yellowstone locomotives were delivered by Baldwin Locomotive Works in spring 1941. As well as the Yellowstones, the DM&IR; had heavy 2-8-8-2 articulated's (also Class M), 2-8-2 Mikados, 2-10-2 Santa Fe's and eventually 2-10-4 Texas types from B&LE.; Ore movement was nearly 45 million tons in 1942 and the War Production Board allowed the Missabe to order ten more Yellowstones, delivered in 1943. The 2-8-8-4's were slowly retired in the latter half of the '50s and the last remaining served until around 1960. = Dieselization and post-war growth= After World War II, the DM&IR; hauled increasing tonnage to the ore docks along Lake Superior, reaching a record of over 49 million tons in 1953. That year the first diesel locomotives, EMD SW9s, arrived on the railway. In 1954, a set of Baldwin DR-4-4-1500 \\"Sharknose\\" diesels arrived from the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern (a fellow U.S. Steel railroad), though they were returned to Baldwin Locomotive Works when the EJ&E; contract expired in 1955. Dieselization continued with the purchase of several EMD SD9 road switchers the following year, while the last revenue steam run occurred in 1961. Passenger service on the Missabe division ended in 1957 and completely ceased system-wide in 1961. As the supply of high-quality iron ore dwindled, mines and pits were closing across Minnesota's iron ranges. The DM&IR;'s ore docks in Two Harbors closed in 1963 and did not reopen until 1966. The Missabe Road was saved by the passage on November 3, 1963, of the Taconite Amendment to the Minnesota State Constitution. (The amendment restricted the state's ability to tax a taconite industry for 25 years.) The passage of the amendment accelerated the creation of the taconite mining industry in Northern Minnesota. The Eveleth Taconite Company was formed in 1964 and on April 8, 1966, the took on the first load of Eveleth taconite pellets, about 23,000 tons. The taconite era on the Missabe had begun. =Ownership and CN merger= In 1988, U.S. Steel, now USX, spun off the DM&IR; and their other ore railroads and shipping companies into the subsidiary Transtar, then sold majority control to the Blackstone Group and USX. In 2001, the DM&IR; and other holdings were spun off from Transtar into the company Great Lakes Transportation (GLT), which was fully owned by the Blackstone Group. For the first time in more than 100 years DM&IR; was no longer associated with U.S. Steel. In late 2003, the Blackstone Group agreed to sell GLT to Canadian National Railway and the purchase was completed on May 10, 2004. Merger with Wisconsin Central In December 2011, the Duluth, Missabe & Iron Range Railway was merged into Wisconsin Central Ltd., which is also controlled by Canadian National Railway. This merger was intended to increase efficiency.

Such establishments commonly serve alcohol and often have arcade games, slot machines, card games, darts, foosball and other games. Some billiard halls may be combined or integrated with a bowling alley. History Pool and billiards developed as in indoor option for games such as croquet which were played on lawns. Dedicated venues began to appear in the 19th century, and by the early 20th century, billiard and pool halls were common in many countries; in 1915 there were 830 in Chicago.\\"Halls Ushered in the Age of Plastic\\". Slate, by Roman Mars. In North America in the 1950s and 1960s especially, pool halls in particular were perceived as a social ill by many, and laws were passed in many jurisdictions to set age limits at pool halls and restrict gambling and the sale of alcohol.\\"Images of the American pool hall show a man‚Äôs world of escape and vice\\". Timeline, Rian Dundon, Jan 30, 2017 The song \\"Trouble\\" in the 1957 hit musical The Music Man lampooned this prejudice (even contrasting carom billiards, requiring \\"judgement, brains, and maturity\\", versus pool, said to be a gateway to laziness, gambling, smoking and philandering). Public perception had become less critical by the 1990s. By the 2010s, with competition from a growing number of competing entertainment venues, as well as the availability of online gambling, revenue from the operation of billiard halls in the United States had declined significantly.\\"Pool & Billiard Halls - US Market Research Report\\".

The historic depth of American pool halls and their subculture was touched on in The Color of Money in various ways, including dialogue extolling the virtues of particular landmark venues, the disappointment at discovering one such hall's closure, a comment that regulars at a well-known hall \\"never leave the street\\" it is on, and the return of a pool hall janitor in The Hustler as a hall owner decades later in the sequel.

He served as high commissioner of the Cretan State during its transition towards independence from Ottoman rule and union with Greece. Youth From 1883, George lived at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen with Prince Valdemar of Denmark, his father's younger brother. The queen had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist him in the Danish royal navy and consigned him to the care of Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet. Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George would later describe to his fianc√©e the profound attachment he developed for his uncle from that day forward. In 1891, George accompanied his cousin the Tsesarevich Nicholas on his voyage to Asia, and saved him from an assassination attempt in Japan, in what became known as the Otsu Incident. Greek endeavors George, along with his brothers Constantine and Nicolas, were involved with the organization of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. George served as president of the Sub- Committee for Nautical Sports. Although much of modern Greece had been independent since the 1820s, Crete remained in Ottoman hands. For the rest of the 19th century, there had been many rebellions and protests on the island. A Greek force arrived to annex the island in 1897 and the Great Powers acted, occupying the island and dividing it into British, French, Russian and Italian areas of control. In 1898, Turkish troops were ejected and a national government was set up, still nominally under Ottoman suzerainty. Prince George, not yet thirty, was made High Commissioner, and a joint Muslim- Christian assembly was part-elected, part-appointed. However, this was not enough to satisfy Cretan nationalists. Eleftherios Venizelos was the leader of the movement to unite Crete with Greece. He had fought in the earlier revolts and was now a member of the Assembly, acting as minister of justice to Prince George. They soon found themselves opposed. George, a staunch royalist, had assumed absolute power. Venizelos led the opposition to this. In 1905, however, he summoned an illegal revolutionary assembly in Theriso, in the hills near Chania, the then capital of the island, the \\"Theriso revolt\\". During the revolt, the newly created Cretan Gendarmerie remained faithful to George. In this difficult period, the Cretan population were divided: in the 1906 elections the pro-Prince parties took 38,127 votes, while pro-Venizelos parties took 33,279. But the Gendarmerie managed to execute its duties without taking sides. Finally, British diplomats brokered a settlement and in September 1906 George was replaced by former Greek prime minister Alexandros Zaimis, and left the island. In 1908, the Cretan Assembly unilaterally declared enosis (union) with Greece. In October 1912 George returned from Paris to Athens so that he could join the naval ministry as Greece prepared for war against Turkey. Later he served as aide-de-camp to King George who, however, was assassinated in March 1913. George went to Copenhagen to settle his father's financial affairs there, as he had never ceased to be a Prince of Denmark. Marriage and family Prince George and his wife Marie Bonaparte, circa 1910-1915 Following a Parisian luncheon between King George and Prince Roland Bonaparte in September 1906 during which the king agreed to the prospect of a marriage between their children, George met Roland's daughter, Princess Marie (2 July 1882 ‚Äì 21 September 1962) on 19 July 1907 at the Bonapartes' home in Paris. A member of one of the non-imperial branches of the Bonaparte dynasty, she was an heiress to the Blanc casino fortune through her mother. Prince George in uniform. He courted her for twenty-eight days, confiding that he had experienced major disappointments when his roles in the Otsu incident and the Cretan governorship were misconstrued and under- appreciated by both individuals and governments who he felt should have known better. He also admitted that, contrary to what he knew were her hopes, he could not commit to living in France permanently since he had to remain prepared to undertake royal duties in Greece or Crete if summoned to do so. Once his proposal of marriage was tentatively accepted, the bride's father was astonished when George waived any contractual clause guaranteeing an allowance or inheritance from Marie; she would retain and manage her own fortune (a trust yielding 800,000 francs per annum) and only their future children would receive legacies. George wed Marie civilly in Paris on 21 November 1907, and in a Greek Orthodox ceremony in Athens the following December, during which George's uncle Valdemar served as the koumbaros. By March Marie was pregnant and, as agreed, the couple returned to France to take up residence. When George brought his bride to Bernstorff for the first family visit, Valdemar's wife Marie d'Orl√©ans was at pains to explain to Marie Bonaparte the intimacy which united uncle and nephew, so deep that at the end of each of George's several yearly visits to Bernstorff, he would weep, Valdemar would take sick, and the women learned the patience not to intrude upon their husbands' private moments. During the first of these visits, Marie Bonaparte and Valdemar found themselves engaging in the kind of passionate intimacies she had looked forward to with her husband who, however, only seemed to enjoy them vicariously, sitting or lying beside his wife and uncle. On a later visit, Marie Bonaparte carried on a passionate flirtation with Prince Aage, Valdemar's eldest son. In neither case does it appear that George objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention. However, George criticized Marie d'Orl√©ans to his wife, alleging that she drank too much and was having an affair with his uncle's stablemaster. But Marie Bonaparte found no fault with her husband's aunt, rather, she admired the forbearance and independence of Valdemar's wife under circumstances which caused her bewilderment and estrangement from her own husband. From 1913 to early 1916, George's wife carried on an intense flirtation, then an affair until May 1919 with French prime minister Aristide Briand. In 1915 Briand wrote to Marie that, having come to know and like Prince George, he felt guilty about their secret passion. George tried to persuade him that Greece, officially neutral during World War I but suspected of sympathy for the Central Powers, really hoped for an Allied victory: He may have influenced Briand to support the disastrous Allied expedition against the Turks at Salonika. When the prince and princess returned in July 1915 to France following a visit to the ailing King Constantine I in Greece, her affair with Briand had become notorious and George expressed a restrained jealousy. By December 1916 the French fleet was bombing Athens and in Paris Briand was suspected, alternately, of having seduced Marie in a futile attempt to bring Greece over to the Allied side, or of having been seduced by her to oust Constantine and set George upon the Greek throne. Although he was on friendly terms with his wife's mentor, Sigmund Freud, in 1925 George asked Marie to give up her work as a psychoanalyst to devote herself to their family life, but she declined. When he learned from the newspapers in 1938 that his only son had married a Russian commoner, George forbade him to return home and refused ever to meet his wife. Prince George and Princess Marie had two children, Petros and Evgenia. * Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark (1908‚Äì1980); an anthropologist, who forfeited his dynastic rights in Greece upon marriage to a commoner. * Princess Eug√©nie of Greece and Denmark (1910‚Äì1988); married, firstly, Prince Dominic Radziwill (1939), whom she divorced in 1946. Her second husband was HSH Prince Raymundo della Torre e Tasso, Duke of Castel Duino, whom she married in 1949 and divorced in 1965. She had children from both marriages. Death On 21 November 1957 Princess Marie and her husband celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Prince George died 25 November 1957, aged eighty- eight, the longest-living dynast of the House of Oldenburg of his generation. He was buried at Tatoi Royal Cemetery with Danish and Greek flags, his wedding ring, a lock of Valdemar's hair, a photo of Valdemar, and earth from Bernstorff. Prince George was the last living child of King George and Queen Olga. Georgioupolis, a coastal resort between Chania and Rethimno, was named after Prince George.

These letters were used in Catholic ceremonies among Turkic Catholics within the Golden Horde. The culture of Catholic Hordians disappeared and this alphabet was lost. For centuries the Tatar language as well as other Turkic languages used a modified Arabic alphabet, ƒ∞ske iml√¢. The alphabet was far from perfect, both technically and logically (different initial, medium, final and stand-alone forms, no glyphs for short vowels). Because of this some Turkic intelligentsia tended to use the Latin or Cyrillic script. The first attempts appeared in the mid-19th century among Azerbaijanis. –ú.–ó. –ó–∞–∫–∏–µ–≤. –¢—é—Ä–∫–æ-—Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ, –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤—ã. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, \\"–ò–Ω—Å–∞–Ω\\", 2005 At the same period the Russian missionary Ilminski, along with followers, invented the modified Russian alphabet for all peoples of Idel-Ural. Modern alphabet uses other glyphs: (”ò instead of ”í, ”® instead of ”¶, “Æ instead of ”∞, “ñ instead of –ñ, “¢ instead of “§), the principles of the modern Cyrillic Tatar alphabet was invented then. Ilmiski's alphabet was used for the purpose of Christianization and Muslim Tatars did not use his alphabet. Ilminski's alphabet is still used among Ker√§≈üen Tatars. This alphabet uses pre-revolutionary Russian spelling of Orthodox names, using Fita and Ukrainian I. In 1908‚Äì1909 the Tatar poet S√§ƒüit R√§miev started to use the Latin script in his works. He offered the use of digraphs: ea for √§, eu for √º, eo for √∂ and ei for ƒ±. Arabists turned down his project. In the early 1920s Azerbaijanis devised their own Latin alphabet, but Tatarstan scholars set a little store to this project, preferring to reform the ƒ∞ske iml√¢. The simplified Iske imla, known as JaÍûëa iml√¢ was used from 1920‚Äì1927. Latinization was adopted by the Soviet officials and the special Central Committee for a New Alphabet was established in Moscow. The first project of the Tatar-Bashkir Latin alphabet was published in E≈ü√ße (The Worker) gazette in 1924. The pronunciation of the alphabet was similar to English, unlike the following. Specific Bashkir sounds were written with digraphs. This alphabet was declined. In 1926 the Congress of Turkologists in Baku recommended to switch all Turkic languages to the Latin script. In April 1926 the JaÍûëa tatar …ôlif ôas—å/Ya√±a tatar √§lifbasƒ±/–Ø“£–∞ —Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ä ”ô–ª–∏—Ñ–±–∞—Å—ã (New Tatar alphabet) society started its work at Kazan. On July 3, 1927, Tatarstan officials declared JaÍûëalif the official script of the Tatar language, replacing the JaÍûëa imla script. The first variant of JaÍûëalif (acutes-JaÍûëalif) is shown in the second table below. There were not separate letters for K and Q (realized as K) and for G and ƒû (realized as G), V and W (realized as W). ≈û (sh) looked like the Cyrillic letter –® (she). C and √á were realized as in Turkish and the modern Tatar Latin alphabet and later were transposed in the final version of JaÍûëalif. In 1928 JaÍûëalif was reformed (see first table below) and was in active use for 12 years. Some sources claim that this alphabet had 34 letters, but the last was a digraph –¨j, used for the corresponding Tatar diphthong. Another source states that the 34th letter was an apostrophe. They also give another sorting of the alphabet. (∆è after A, –¨ after E) After the introduction of JaÍûëalif most of the books which were printed in the Arabic alphabet were withdrawn from libraries. =JaÍûëalif as published in the E≈ü√ße newspaper= { class=\\"Unicode wikitable\\" style=\\"float:left;text- align:center;background:white;\\" + '1924-07-18 E≈ü√ße alphabet !

JaÍûëalif was also used in Nazi gazettes for prisoners of war and propaganda during World War II. The alphabet served until the 1950s, because most of the schoolbooks were printed before World War II. Some Tatar diasporas also used JaÍûëalif outside of the Soviet Union, for example the Tatar bureau of Radio Free Europe. For 12 years of usage the Latin script, Arabic script (and not only Ja√±a iml√¢, but ƒ∞ske iml√¢ too) also were used. One of the Musa C√§lil's Moabit Notebooks was written in JaÍûëalif, and another was written in Arabic letters. Both notebooks were written in German prison, after 1939, the year when the Cyrillic script was established. Restoring JaÍûëalif Cyrillic –¨-like letter, in some fonts also looks like ∆Ñ, and is not currently represented in Unicode. Only some Tatar fonts use this glyph.N-descender, a variant of ≈ä, that was used in JaÍûëalif and is represented in Unicode since 6.0. Only some Tatar fonts use this glyph at the position of √ë. In the 1990s some wanted to restore JaÍûëalif, or JaÍûëalif+W, as being appropriate for the modern Tatar phonetics. But technical problems, such as font problems and the disuse of Uniform Turkic alphabet among other peoples, forced the use of a \\"Turkish-based alphabet\\". In 2000 such an alphabet was adopted by the Tatarstan government, but in 2002 it was abolished by the Russian Federation. =Inalif= The \\"Internet-style\\" alphabet named Inalif after Internet and √§lifba was convented in 2003 and partly it was inspired by JaÍûëalif. The main purpose of this alphabet was standardization of texts, which are typed on a standard English keyboard, without any diacritical marks. But this is not a simple transliteration of non-English symbols of JaÍûëalif or modern alphabet. Sounds absent from English are represented with digraphs; soft vowels are represented as a combination of the pairmate and apostrophe, apart from , corresponding to ‚ü®—å‚ü© in JaÍûëalif, which is represented as ‚ü®y‚ü©, probably under influence of transliteration of Russian. Like in JaÍûëalif, ‚ü®j‚ü© represent , and ‚ü®zh‚ü© is used for , corresponding to ‚ü®∆∂‚ü© in JaÍûëalif. ‚ü®x‚ü© isn't used in Inalif, and ‚ü®kh‚ü© is used instead. Other changes include: ‚ü®√§‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®a'‚ü©; ‚ü®√∂‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®o'‚ü©; ‚ü®√º‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®u'‚ü©; ‚ü®√ß‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®ch‚ü©; ‚ü®ƒü‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®gh‚ü©; ‚ü®√±‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®ng‚ü©; ‚ü®≈ü‚ü© ‚Üí ‚ü®sh‚ü©. The sorting order of Inalif isn't specified, but in practice, the English sorting order is used. Inalif is used only on the Internet.

Assigned as a tender in the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838-42 commanded by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, Flying Fish sailed with her squadron 19 August 1838 to visit Madeira and Rio de Janeiro while bound for Tierra del Fuego, where the squadron arrived early in 1839. From this point, the squadron made its first cruises toward the Antarctic Continent, which it was to discover later the same year after surveys among Pacific islands and a visit to Australia. After the second penetration of the Antarctic, the squadron rendezvoused in New Zealand in April 1840 to survey Pacific islands northward toward the Hawaiians, where the ships were repaired late in the year. Flying Fish sailed with to resurvey some of the Samoan, Ellice, Kingsmill, and Pescadore Islands before joining the main body of the squadron on the northwest coast of America in July 1841. Flying Fish made surveys in the Columbia River and around Vancouver, then proceeded to San Francisco, from which the squadron sailed 1 November for the south Pacific. Arriving in the Philippines in mid-January 1842 Flying Fish and the other ships separated to cruise the Sulu Seas, then make a planned rendezvous at Singapore in February.

It is a cross between the Chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. Standards were produced in 1984, and the breed gained championship status in the United Kingdom in the 1990s. Origin The Burmilla was born in the United Kingdom. Two cats, a Chinchilla Persian named Sanquist and a Brown Tortie Burmese named Faberg√©, were both awaiting a partner of their own breed in different rooms. One night, the cleaner left the door open. The two cats bred, producing four kittens born in 1981; thus, a new breed was born.ASPCA: \\"Complete Guide to Cats\\". Chanticleer Press, 1999 In GCCF (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), the Burmilla is considered part of the Asian group. It is accepted in FIFe as the Burmilla. Only the Shaded Silver and Silver Tipped varieties have been recognized in FIFe, CCCA, ACF and CFA as the Burmilla. As of late 2011, the Shaded Golden and Golden Tipped Burmilla are also recognized within FIFe. One governing body in Australia has used the name Australian Tiffanie; however, there is not international acceptance and standardization for this breed - the name \\"Tiffany\\" has been used to describe many different breeds, having an appearance from the Ragdoll to the Birman, and may contain any of these breeds and more. Many Australian Tiffanies in Australia contain more than three- quarters Chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned Chinchilla Persian. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup. Appearance This picture shows the facial features of the Burmilla. =Body= Burmillas are medium-sized with muscular yet elegant bodies, tending to weigh between 3‚Äì6 kg. Their distinguishing feature is their sparkling silver coat, and distinctive ‚Äúmake up‚Äù lining the nose, lips and eyes. =Head= Gently rounded top of head; medium width between ears; wide at eyebrow level and jaw hinge, tapering to a short, blunt wedge. The profile shows a gentle nose break. Tip of nose and chin should be in line. Chin is firm, with good depth. =Ears and eyes= Medium to large, broad at base with slightly rounded tips. Ear set with slight forward tilt in profile. Eye shape is large; placed well apart at slight oblique setting; slightly curved upper; line angeled toward the nose, with a fuller curved lower line. Eye color luminous, any shade of green. Some allowance can be made for a gold or yellow tinge in kittens and young adults. =Coat= The Burmilla comes in two coat lengths, semi-longhair and shorthair. Semi-longhair Burmilla are known as the Tiffanie in GCCF. The most common (standard) coat is the shorthair. This is a short, close-lying coat, similar in appearance to the Burmese, but with a slightly padded feel. Due to the undercoat, it has a very soft, silky feel. The recessive longhair gene inherited from the Chinchilla Persian can produce longhair Burmilla. These cats have a semi-longhair coat following the lines of the body, with a soft, silky feel and a large plumed tail. The shorthair gene is dominant and where a cat receives one of each, the appearance will be shorthair. Two longhair Burmillas mated together will always produce longhair kittens, while shorthair matings depend on whether the longhair genes are carried by the shorthair parents. =Colours= The Burmilla has a variety of coat colours, including black, blue, brown, chocolate and lilac. Red, cream and tortoiseshell (calico) varieties have been bred, these colours are not yet recognized by CCCA in Australia. All the Burmilla coat colours can be expressed in either Burmese expression, or full expression. The Burmilla is now recognized in Shaded Golden and Golden Tipped in FIFe registries, but only Shaded Silver and Silver Tipped everywhere else. The Burmilla's shading comes in two major coat patterns which relate to the depth of colour. These are Tipped and Shaded. Tipped Burmillas have a light dusting of colour (1/8 to 1/4) over the top of a silver or golden undercoat. In the case of Silvers, these cats can appear almost white. Shaded Burmillas have 1/4 - 1/2 as their colour, giving the appearance of a mantle of colour over the back, shoulders and outside of the legs. Smoke pattern is not a Burmilla and in some registries is only allowed to be registered for breeding, not showing, they have almost all colour with only a faint pale base to each hair. The cats have nose leather coloured correspondingly to their coat colour and outlined in the matching coat shading colour. In addition, their paw pads correspond to the coat colouring: Black Silver cats have black or very dark brown paw pads, Brown will have dark brown, Chocolate have pinkish brown, Blues have Blue-grey and Lilacs have Dove grey tinged with pink. =Colour genetics= Since the Burmilla inherits its colour ranges from two different breeds, there is also the possibility of the entire Burmese spectrum of colours (Black, Brown, Blue, Chocolate, Lilac and all the O gene range, both in Burmese Expression and in Full Expression). The inheritance of Silver also means that expression of colour can be variable; silver can darken and cool colour. However, since the Burmilla has a shaded coat pattern, it can be difficult to identify the various subtle shades of Burmese colouring that are recessive to the Persian colouring. Temperament This Burmilla cat demonstrates the playful 'kitten-like' traits of the breed. The Burmilla is quite an irreverent and independent cat who adores its owner and displays many kitten-like characteristics, even into adulthood. In temperament they are sociable, playful and affectionate and get along well with children and other animals. Burmillas should be fed a balanced diet of raw meat, canned food, or dry food. Weekly brushing of the coat is recommended.

History =Corporate Ancestors= American Information Systems In October 1974, Robert J. Urosevich of the Klopp Printing Company of Omaha approached Westinghouse Learning Corporation (a subsidiary of Westinghouse Corporation) with a simple question: Could the scanners Westinghouse was building for educational tests be used to scan ballots? This led Westinghouse to briefly enter the ballot scanning business, and Robert Urosevich and his brother Tod, a former IBM salesman, formed Data Mark Systems to sell and service Westinghouse vote tabulation equipment. Data Mark and Westinghouse ballot tabulation equipment saw limited success through the late 1970s.Jon McMillin papers, University of Iowa Library, Special Collections, see particularly the catalog description of box 36.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 4.1 on, page 64. As Westinghouse withdrew from the voting business, the Urosevich brothers and several former Westinghouse employees founded a new company in August 1979, American Information Systems. AIS came out with a line of central-count ballot scanners that entered the marketplace in 1982. Business Records Corporation The first precinct-count ballot scanner was the Gyrex MTB-1, which came to market around 1974.Analytic Systems Inc., Section 4.4, Gyrex Corporation, Describe, Analize and Compare the Currently Available Methods of Vote Counting Equipment and to make Appropriate Recommendations, final report prepared for the General Accounting Office under Contract No. GA-924, October 1974. The MTB-1 evolved into the MTB-2 while corporate ownership shifted from Gyrex Corporation to Valtec, in 1977, to Major Data Concepts, in 1979. Computer Election Systems Incorporated (CESI), a manufacturer of Votomatic punched-card voting equipment, marketed the MTB-2 as the Tally-II scanner in the early 1980s, pairing it with its own Precinct-Ballot-Conut punched-card ballot reader, the PBC.Douglas W.

Rivest, et al, eds, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol 6000 (2010). CESI developed its own family of precinct-count and later central-count scanners, under the Optech brand name. The Optech I precinct-count scanner came to market in 1983, and saw successful use in several states. Cronus Industries, Inc., a Texas company, purchased CESI in 1985 and merged it with their ballot printing subsidiary, Business Records Corporation (BRC).Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 4.2 on, page 66. Election Products Inc. Election Products Inc. was a small Virginia- based election service company. In the early 1990s, the company contracted with ILJ Corporation of Richmond, Virginia, to develop a DRE voting machine that would be marketed as the Votronic (unrelated to an earlier ballot scanner that was marketed under the same name in the 1960s). This voting machine had a flat panel liquid crystal display and a touchscreen, and was not much bigger than the laptop computers of its time. The Votronic saw its first use in the 1996 primary season; one commentator said it resembled a large Magna Doodle.Voting Becomes More sophisticated, Washington Technology, March 7, 1996.The Present and Future Ballot, page 9 of Vote, the Machinery of Democracy, Smithsonian Institution, 2004.Douglas W.

At the time, AIS had about 750 customers and BRC had around 1200, where each customer was typically a county election office. As a result of this merger, ES&S; became the largest voting system vendor in the United States.Section 4A: Status Report Concerning Recertification of Business Records Corporation PC/BT Voting System, Meeting Minutes, Indiana Election Commission, November 25, 1997. This merger was delayed by the United States Department of Justice on antitrust grounds until ES&S; agreed to transfer the Optech product line to Sequoia Voting Systems, while retaining the right to sell and service Optech products to its existing customers. An iVotronic with a Real-Time Audit Log printer, a type of . Shortly after the BRC-AIS merger, ES&S; acquired the rights to the Votronic. They immediately made major cosmetic changes to the Votronic, renaming it the iVotronic. In their sales presentations, ES&S; emphasized that the iVotronic was essentially the same machine as the Votronic except for features added to bring it into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.Section 3: Demonstration of the ES&S; iVotronic DRE Voting System, Minutes, Indiana Election Commission, August 7, 2001 ES&S; was one of the top four providers of voting equipment used in the November 2004 election. The other three were Diebold Election Systems, Sequoia Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic. ES&S; acquired AutoMARK Technical Systems on January 28, 2008.Company Overview of AutoMARK Technical Systems, LLC, Bloomberg, accessed August 2016. Under ES&S;, the AutoMark came into widespread use. By 2016, it was used statewide in 10 states, and widely used in 19 additional states.Election Systems and Software (ES&S;) AutoMARK, Verified Voting, accessed August 2016. ES&S; acquired Premier Election Solutions (formerly known as Diebold Election Systems) on September 3, 2009. Following the acquisition, the Department of Justice and 14 individual states launched investigations into the transaction on antitrust grounds. In March 2010, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against ES&S;, requiring it to divest voting equipment systems assets it purchased in September 2009 from Premier Election Solutions in order to restore competition. The company later sold the assets to Dominion Voting Systems. =Recent ownership= In June 2019, ES&S; was wholly owned by \\"Government Systems, Software & Services, Inc,\\" of which \\"McCarthy Group. LLC\\" held a controlling ownership, and shares over 5% each were held by Tom Burt and Tom O'Brien. Shares over 5% of McCarthy Group in turn were owned by passive investors Nancy McCarthy and Kenneth Stinson. Burt is president/CEO of ES&S;, and O'Brien is vice president/CFO. Controversies =Certification of Voting Systems= In May 2013, the Election Assistance Commission certified ES&S;' EVS 5.0 election management system as meeting the commission's 2005 Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines (VVSG). Products included in EVS 5.0 are ES&S;' DS200 and DS850 vote tabulators. EVS 5.0 also saw enhancements to the company's AutoMARK software, which is designed to be compliant with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 for allowing voters with disabilities to cast ballots. In October 2012, the EAC certified ES&S;' Unity 3.4.0.0 election management software. In June 2014, the Virginia Board of Elections certified EVS 5201, the first state to certify an election management system that features the ExpressVote Universal Voting System. This election system combines paper-based voting with touch screen technology that's designed to serve every eligible voter, including those with disabilities. After EVS 5201 was certified, Fairfax County, Virginia, purchased the ExpressVote Universal Voting System in June. The county intends to use the system for the first time for the November 2014 general election. =Electronic Poll Books for the City of Chicago= In January 2014, the City of Chicago reached an agreement with ES&S; to provide more than 2,100 ExpressPollhttp://www.essvote.com/products/5/41/electronic- poll-books/expresspoll/ voter check-in and verification devices to support the city's 1.6 million registered voters. The electronic poll books were first used in Chicago's 2014 primary elections. =Withdrawal and Reinstatement of InkaVote= On August 3, 2007, California Secretary of state Debra Bowen withdrew approval of the ES&S; InkaVote Plus after announcing a \\"top-to-bottom review\\" of the voting machines certified for use in California in March 2007. However, the InkaVote Plus was never included in the review process conducted by Bowen's office. Bowen then approved InkaVote Plus for use by Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles on January 2, 2008. =Oakland County, Michigan= Early voters in the 2008 Presidential election reported instances of malfunctioning machines. People complained that they voted for one candidate, only to have their selection switch to another. The clerk of Oakland County, Michigan reported inconsistent results with some machines during testing in October. For the 2012 elections, ES&S; added wireless modem technology so officials could make secure reports via cell phones. This upgrade was designed to improve the transparency and accuracy of Oakland County's election night reporting. The wireless technology used by Oakland County was tested by a federally accredited Voting System Test Laboratory and subsequently tested and approved by the State of Michigan for pilot usage in the November 2012 presidential election. =Reported problems during the 2010 election= On April 14, 2010, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that ‚ÄúAbout 10 percent of Cuyahoga County‚Äôs voting machines ‚Ä¶ [had] failed a pre-election test.‚Äù After 20 months of investigating the DS200 Precinct Count Optical Scanner in the EAC-certified Unity 3.2.0.0 voting system, on December 22, 2011, the Election Assistance Commission recommended decertification of the ES&S; voting machine if it cannot be fixed. From the findings: *‚ÄúThe DS200 accepts a voted ballot but does not record the ballot on its internal counter. In addition the marks of the second ballot are not recorded.‚Äù *‚ÄúWhen a 17‚Äù ballot was inserted at an angle, the DS200 did not consistently count the mark properly. The mark registered either as a different selection than intended or did not register at all.‚Äù *The system randomly freezes and does not record the freeze in its log files. There are other events not logged, such as touch screen calibration. In May 2013, however, the Election Assistance Commission certified the DS200 as part of ES&S;' EVS 5.0 election management system as meeting its 2005 Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines (VVSG). Image of EAC certificate =Remote Access Controversy= In a February 2018 article in The New York Times,Zetter, Kim, \\"The Myth of the Hacker-Proof Voting Machine\\", The New York Times Magazine, Feb. 21, 2018. Retrieved 17 July 2018. reporter Kim Zetter reported that remote-access software had been found on an election management computer system used in Pennsylvania, and quoted unnamed sources saying \\"ES&S; has in the past sometimes sold its election-management system with remote-access software preinstalled,\\" and that this was used by ES&S; technicians to remotely access the systems via modem to troubleshoot and provide maintenance to systems they sold. She also included a response from the company denying this, stating ‚ÄúNone of the employees‚Ä¶ including long- tenured employees, has any knowledge that our voting systems have ever been sold with remote-access software.‚Äù In a letter sent to Senator Ron Wyden in April 2018, Election Systems & Software made the disclosure that in fact \\"some\\" of the election management systems that they sold for voting did have remote-access software installed. This disclosure was made public in July 2018.Zetter, Kim, \\"\\"Top Voting Machine Vendor Admits It Installed Remote- Access Software on Systems Sold to States\\", Motherboard, Jul 17 2018. Retrieved 17 July 2018.Kalmbacher, C., \\"Voting Machine Vendor Changes Story, Admits They Put Remote-Access Software on Machines for Years\\", Law and Crime, July 17th, 2018. Retrieved 17 July 2018.Chalfant, M., \\"Voting equipment maker sold systems with remote-access software\\", The Hill, July 17, 2018. Retrieved 17 July 2018. The letter to Wyden had been in response to a question from the senator requesting clarification of the information on remote-access software in the New York Times article. While election-management systems are not the voting machines voters use to cast their ballots, they are used to program the voting machines used in a county and to count and tabulate the results from the voting machines. By installing remote access software allowing the machines to be accessed via the internet, the machines are vulnerable to being \\"hacked\\" remotely, allowing the counting to be altered surreptitiously, or malware to be installed to affect an election result. Motherboard, the site that originally published the story, called the remote access software installation \\"the worst decision for security short of leaving ballot boxes on a Moscow street corner.\\" According to the April letter, ES&S; claims to have stopped installing the remote-access software in December 2007, in response to standards adopted by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. = Johnson County, Indiana = On election day November 6, 2018, thousands of voters in Johnson County, Indiana had to wait in line for hours as technical glitches and computer crashes caused issues throughout the county. A preliminary report prepared for the Indiana Secretary of State by Ball State‚Äôs Voting System Technical Oversight Program, or VSTOP, examined all of the things that went wrong on election day. In this preliminary report the investigators concluded that ES&S; failed to report several \\"anomalies\\" that occurred prior to election day, which violates Indiana election law. = Operating Software Vulnerabilities = In a July 13, 2019 article, Associated Press reporter Tami Abdollah reported that \\"the vast majority of 10,000 election jurisdictions nationwide use Windows 7 or an older operating system to create ballots, program voting machines, tally votes and report counts.\\" Windows 7 reaches its \\"end of life\\" on January 14, 2020, meaning that Microsoft will stop providing technical support such as patches to fix software vulnerabilities. For jurisdictions that have already purchased systems running on Windows 7, ES&S; said it will be working with Microsoft to provide support until jurisdictions can update. Windows 10 came out in 2015. Though ES&S; is testing a new system it‚Äôs unclear how long it will take to complete the process ‚Äî federal and possible state recertification, plus rolling out updates ‚Äî and if it will be done before primaries begin in February. Kevin Skoglund, chief technologist for Citizens for Better Elections, said county election officials point to Election Assistance Commission and state certifications as ‚Äúrock-solid proof‚Äù their systems are secure, but don‚Äôt realize vendors are certifying systems under 2005 standards.

These automobile extravaganzas were designed to whet public appetite and boost automobile sales with displays of fancy prototypes, concept vehicles and other special or halo models. Motorama grew out of Alfred P. Sloan's yearly industrial luncheons at New York City's Waldorf Astoria, beginning in 1931. They were almost invariably held in conjunction with the New York Auto Show, that for many years was held traditionally in the first week of January. History =1949= After World War II, the first show, Transportation Unlimited Autorama, was staged again at the Waldorf Astoria, in January 1949. Between the New York City venue and the Boston extension, nearly 600,000 people saw the show. Seven \\"special\\" Cadillacs were exhibited including, inter alia, a Series 61 coupe and a Series 62 sedan that were standard except for a special paint finish; also shown were The Caribbean, the Embassy, and the Fleetwood Coupe de Ville, all built on the Series Sixty Special chassis. =1950= During the 1950 show, more than 320,000 visitors admired the Cadillac Debutante, a special convertible trimmed in leopard skins. There was no Autorama or Motorama in 1952. Cadillac celebrated its Golden Anniversary (50 years of production) in 1952, and two show cars were on display at various venues around the country: the Cadillac Townsman, a custom Series Sixty Special sedan, and the Cadillac Eldorado special convertible that went into limited production in 1953. =1953 and 1954= The show officially became known as Motorama when it began to travel around the country in 1953. That year more than 1.4 million visitors saw it; Motorama's opening day in New York drew 45,000 visitors. There was a revue, with orchestra, singers, and dancers. Exhibited at this venue were the Buick Wildcat, Pontiac La Parisienne, Oldsmobile Starfire, Chevrolet Corvette, Cadillac Orleans and Le Mans. More than 1.9 million visitors attended the show in 1954; it started on January 26 in the Waldorf Astoria, New York. On display were the experimental Oldsmobile F-88 and Cutlass, Buick Wildcat II, Chevrolet Nomad station wagon, General Motors Firebird XP-21 and Pontiac Bonneville Special, Cadillac El Camino, Cadillac La Espada and Cadillac Park Avenue, all featuring fiberglass bodies. =1955 and 1956= The 1955 show dates were New York (January 20‚Äì25), Miami (February 5‚Äì13), Los Angeles (March 5‚Äì13), San Francisco (March 26 to April 3), Boston (April 23 to May 1). Exhibited at these venues were the Buick Wildcat III, Chevrolet Biscayne, Pontiac Strato Star, Oldsmobile 88 Delta, LaSalle II roadster and sedan, and Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. Oldsmobile and Buick pillarless four-door hardtops were first shown at this show. In 1956 over 2.2 million visitors attended. The dates were New York City (January 19‚Äì24), Miami (February 4‚Äì12), Los Angeles (March 3‚Äì11), San Francisco (March 24 to April 1), Boston (April 19‚Äì29). Featured cars included Buick Centurion, General Motors Firebird II, the Oldsmobile Golden Rocket, Pontiac Club de Mer, Cadillac Eldorado Brougham and Eldorado Brougham Town Car. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will recognize the 1956 show as the Motorama featured in the short film Design for Dreaming. No shows were held for the next two years. In 1957, however, Cadillac did display a couple of show cars at various venues. These were the Cadillac Director and the Eldorado Brougham town car of the previous year. Also, in 1958, a special Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible toured various automobile shows; it was equipped with a rain sensor designed to automatically raise the top and all window glass, in case of a rain shower. =1959‚Äì1961= The \\"1959\\" Motorama was held from October 16-22, 1958, at the Waldorf Astoria, New York City, before moving on to Boston. Shown in these two east coast cities were General Motors Firebird III and the Cadillac Cyclone. The final Motorama show was held in 1961 in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. More than one million visitors attended. More than 100 trucks were needed to transport Motorama shows around the country, each arriving at a precise time and in a given order. Cars and simultaneous revues were displayed on lifting, revolving platforms known as \\"grass-hoppers\\". A total of 10.5 million visitors saw Motorama shows between 1949 and 1961.

Eduard Alexander Felix Kersten (30 September 1898 ‚Äì 16 April 1960) was the personal physical therapist of Heinrich Himmler. Kersten used his contacts with Himmler to help people persecuted by Nazi Germany. Early life Kersten was born in a Baltic German family in Tartu (Dorpat), Imperial Russia, now Tartu, in Estonia. During the First World War he fought in the German Army and arrived in Finland in April 1918 with the German forces that intervened in the Finnish Civil War. Kersten served for a while in Suojeluskunta, was granted Finnish citizenship in 1920, and in September 1921 was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant (v√§nrikki) into the Finnish Army. After his return to civilian life, Kersten remained in Helsinki, where he studied therapy with the specialist Dr Colander, and after two years was awarded a certificate in physical therapy. He then left for Berlin, where he continued his studies and eventually became the pupil of a notable Chinese therapeutic masseur, Dr Ko,John H. Waller, Felix Kersten and the Secret Plot to Turn Himmler Against Hitler (2002), pp.9-10 whom he had met at a dinner party. In 1925, Ko told Kersten \\"You have learned all I can teach you.\\" He then turned his practice over to Kersten and retired to Tibet. Kersten had a number of influential patients, among them Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands (after 1928) and Benito Mussolini‚Äôs son-in-law, the Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano. Kersten accepted Heinrich Himmler's request to become his personal physical therapist, writing later that he feared for his safety if he had refused. He was able to alleviate Himmler‚Äôs severe stomach pains with his skills and gained his trust. Kersten used this trust to obtain pardons and the release of underground prisoners, labor camp inmates, homosexuals and others.Himmler's healer: The story of Felix Kersten, Haaretz Second World War During the Second World War, Kersten also provided information to the OSS, predecessor of the CIA. Towards the end of the war, Kersten arranged a meeting between Himmler and Norbert Masur, a member of the Swedish branch of the World Jewish Congress, in Hartzwalde, a few miles from Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. As a result, Himmler agreed to spare the lives of the remaining 60,000 Jews left in Nazi concentration camps days before their liberation by the Allies. In December 1945, the World Jewish Congress presented Kersten with a letter thanking him for helping to save Jewish concentration camp victims. Later life Kersten (1948) In his postwar memoirs, Kersten took credit for saving the entirety of the Dutch population from being forcibly deported to Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe. In January 1950, the Dutch monarchy awarded him the Order of Orange-Nassau on the basis of his account. However, a later investigation by Dutch historian Louis de Jong concluded that the mass deportation plan had not existed, and that many of Kersten's documents had been fabricated.Louis de Jong, 1972, \\"Heeft Kersten het Nederlandse volk gered?\\". Reprinted in German translation: H-H. Wilhelm and L. de Jong. Zwei Legenden aus dem dritten Reich: quellenkritische Studien, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt 1974, pp. 79‚Äì142. The Swedish archives testify that Kersten was an intermediary between Himmler and Count Folke Bernadotte in the negotiations that led to the rescue operation 'The White Buses', saving hundreds of Norwegians and Danes from certain death in the last days of the Third Reich. Kersten's claims of being instrumental in saving Finland‚Äôs Jews from German hands may be exaggerated, but the Finnish government used his services in the hope of influencing Himmler. After the war, Kersten lived in West Germany and Sweden, taking Swedish citizenship in 1953. He died in Hamm, while he was visiting Germany, aged 61.Kersten, Eduard Alexander Felix. BBLD ‚Äì Baltisches Biographisches Lexikon Digital. Kersten's war memoirs were published in English translation in 1947 and a second edition was published in 1956 (The Kersten memoirs, 1940‚Äì1945, London 1956) with an introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper. In popular culture Writer and journalist Joseph Kessel was the first to write about the life of Felix Kersten, in his book The man with the miraculous hands (1960). Felix Kersten is parodied in the Woody Allen book Getting Even, in the chapter entitled \\"The Schmeed Memoirs\\", in which a fictional barber in wartime Germany describes his time as a hair stylist for Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officers. Kersten also appears as a character in the film Hitler: a film from Germany, directed by Hans-J√ºrgen Syberberg and as the main character in the 2014 novel Gods and Devils. Kersten is played by actor Martin Jarvis in the radio play by Neville Watchurst A Vital Flaw, about his work to help Heinrich Himmler's health. The play was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in February 1994, then on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 5 September 2009.

Strauss' publisher, Fritz Simrock, suggested the title Kaiser-Walzer since the title could allude to either monarch, and thus satisfy the vanity of both rulers.

It was founded in 1849 and originally based in Covington, Ohio.https://www.facebook.com/drumsanddrummers/posts/297640810363346 During the twentieth century, their drums enjoyed popularity with musicians spanning from the Dixieland jazz era in the 1920s to classic rock in the 1960s and 1970s, but was particularly associated with many notable big band and swing drummers of the 1940s and 1950s.  History  The Rogers company was started in 1849 by an Irish immigrant from Dublin named Joseph Rogers. Rogers came to the United States and started crafting drum heads in Brewster‚Äôs Station, New York. A second tannery was established later in Farmingdale, New Jersey, operated by son Joseph H. Rogers Junior. Grandson Cleveland S. Rogers began to manufacture the first ‚ÄúRogers‚Äù drums at the Farmingdale tannery in the 1930s. The first Rogers drums were assembled from shells and hardware of other manufacturers but mounted with Rogers heads. In 1955, Cleveland, who had no heirs, sold the Rogers drum company to Henry Grossman. Grossman moved the company to Covington, Ohio, and under his leadership, Rogers was propelled to the forefront of American drum making for the next decade and a half. Design engineer Joe Thompson and marketing guru Ben Strauss were instrumental in Rogers' success during its golden age from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s. The company's drums were embraced by musicians from the Dixieland movement to the classic rockers of the 1960s and 1970s. However, the manufacturer was most closely associated with the \\"big band\\" and swing drummers of the 1940s and 1950s. Rogers is probably most famous for its \\"Dyna-Sonic\\" snare drum, which featured a number of innovations. In particular, was a unique cradle in which the snare wires were supported. This device provided a means by which the longitudinal tension of the snare wires could be adjusted independently of the vertical force holding the snares against the bottom head. As a result, the snares could be tensioned as tightly as the drummer wanted without having to pull the snares against the head so hard they constrained (choked) the head's vibration. This and other innovations (for example, a remarkably shallow‚Äî4/1000\\"‚Äîsnare bed) made possible by the novel tensioning arrangement gave the drum a relatively crisp and recognizably clear sound. Dyna-Sonics were made from about 1961 until the mid-'80s. The company was bought in 1966 by CBS Musical Instruments, which had also acquired in 1965 Fender Guitars and Rhodes Pianos. The vast majority of Dyna-Sonics had COB (chrome over brass) shells. Only a small number of wood-shell Dyna-Sonics was made during the lifetime of the drum. Pristine models can fetch thousands of dollars on the vintage drum market. Other notable Rogers drums were the Powertone model of snare drums and the Holiday model of tom-toms and bass drums. Fiberglass timpani were also manufactured for a time, the model being called Accu-Sonic. In addition to its Dyna-Sonic snare drum, Rogers was renowned for its highly- innovative hardware. Much of it was developed by Thompson, including the Swiv- o-Matic line of bass drum pedals, hi-hats, cymbal stands, and tom-tom holders. The cymbal stands and tom-tom holders featured a ball-and-socket tilting mechanism. Even Ludwig drummers like Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Mike Allgaier of XHS, and John Bonham of Led Zeppelin used some Swiv-o-Matic hardware items on their kits. Neil Peart used a single Swiv-o-Matic tom holder on his large Slingerland and Tama drum kits through the mid-1980s in order to position a tom-tom directly over the center of one of his bass drums. From 1964 until 1975, Rogers shells were 5-ply construction of alternating plies of maple and birch wood with reinforcement rings. From late 1975 until 1978 the shells were made up of 5 alternating plies of maple and birch wood with reinforcement rings. Starting in 1978, Rogers began offering drums with 8-ply shells without reinforcement rings (made by Keller Products, Inc. of Manchester, NH) for its XP-8 line. They marked the beginning of relatively heavy, thick \\"stadium\\" shells that favored attack and projection over midrange tonality. These drums were promoted as \\"the best Rogers drums ever made\\" and the XP-8 models lived up to that claim. 1976 saw the introduction of \\"Memriloc\\" hardware. This innovation was co-developed by Dave Donoho and Roy Burns. It was the first of the super- stable hardware systems and was subsequently copied by most major drum manufacturers in one form or another. Most modern drum hardware evolved from the Rogers Memrilock concept. For the growing European market, Rogers drums were made in the UK by Ajax under license from Rogers USA. The hardware was Rogers but the drum shells were supplied by Ajax from its UK production. Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five and Pete York of the Spencer Davis Group were prominent British drummers using Rogers equipment during that era; along with Mick Avory of the Kinks (before switching to Ludwig) and John Steel of the Animals (after switching from Premier). Shortly after being purchased by CBS in 1966, Rogers drums moved its production in 1969 from Ohio to a Fullerton, CA factory complex, where the American Fender Guitars were also produced. In 1983, CBS sold Rogers and Fender to a group of individuals who were running the Fender division; the new owners soon after decided to discontinue the Rogers Drums line. Between 1984 and 1998, the Rogers name was owned by Island Music, who manufactured cheap copies of the famous Big R Rogers drums overseas. In 1998, the Rogers name was acquired by the Brook Mays Music Company (\\"BMMC\\") of Dallas, TX. Jim Rosenthal, then VP Marketing for BMMC identified the opportunity to purchase the name and revitalize the brand. BMMC began the brand as a low-cost, but high-quality import line of beginner drum sets that were sold exclusively through the company's own chain of music stores. The first kits were manufactured by Peace Drums of Taiwan. The drums sold successfully because many drummers (especially younger ones) wanted Rogers kits and the kits were excellent value. Bill Crowden, son-in-law of Bill Ludwig, was working for BMMC at the time and was brought in to the Dallas office to run Rogers. Together with Jim Rosenthal, they developed the line, using the names of Rogers kits and drums from the '60s. A high-quality line of kits emerged that included maple and birch shells with beavertail lugs and modern double-braced hardware. Sales of Rogers kits across the board for BMMC were extremely successful. However, in the summer of 2006, BMMC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On August 26, 2006, the Yamaha Corporation of America announced that it had acquired the intellectual property rights to the Rogers Drum Company at the BMMC bankruptcy court-ordered auction. \\"Opportunities to acquire a well-respected brand that is so treasured by players do not come along everyday,\\" said Tom Sumner, Vice President and General Manager of Yamaha's Pro Audio & Combo Division. \\"We will use our expertise to improve on the Rogers legacy.\\" Yamaha displayed its new Rogers drums at winter NAMM 2007. In 2013, the rights to Rogers drums were acquired by Joseph Chen, then the president of Dixon Drums. In 2017, Rogers was revived as a manufacturer of high-end handcrafted snare drums, utilizing many of the familiar hardware designs from the 1950s and 1960s. They have reissued a 5-ply maple version of the \\"Dyna-Sonic\\" snare drum featuring the \\"Clock Face\\" double-rail snare straining device and re-engineered \\"Bread and Butter\\" lugs.

Explanation of codes The Mitsubishi zaibatsu had been broken up into three companies by the US occupying forces. Automobile and truck engines were mainly built by three branches of one of these companies, Central Heavy Industries (Shin-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries from 1952). These three branches (Mizushima, Nagoya, and Kyoto Engineering Works) were established as clusters of the many small aircraft factories built during the war. Thus, Mizushima developments gained the ME code, followed by a numerical, while engines developed in Nagoya became the NE-series and Kyoto- developments were named KE. The numbers do not in any way relate to each other or across letter codes and were purely issued in order of development. In 1964 the three companies were merged into Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and eventually a new naming system emerged. Since the introduction of the 2G10 engine in October 1968, Mitsubishi engines use a four-digit naming convention: * The first (digit) signifies the number of cylinders; \\"2\\" = straight-2, \\"3\\" = straight-3, \\"4\\" = straight-4, \\"6\\" = V6, \\"8\\" = V8. * The second (letter) formerly referred to the fuel type; \\"D\\" = diesel, \\"G\\" = gasoline. However, since the 1980s, this has changed. Two engine families were introduced using the letter \\"A\\" to denote that all the engines in the family had an alloy cylinder head. Their latest engines, however, do not follow any previous conventions (e.g. 4M4, 3B2, etc.). * The third (digit) previously denoted the engine family. Five of the \\"4G\\" straight-four engine families had distinct names; \\"4G1\\" = Orion, \\"4G3\\" = Saturn, \\"4G4\\" = Neptune, \\"4G5\\" = Astron, and \\"4G6\\" = Sirius. * The fourth (digit) is the specific engine model within the family, issued in order of development. It is not a guide to its place within that family, nor is it a guide to the capacity of the engine. There may also be supplementary letters after the initial four characters. \\"T\\" can indicate that the engine is turbocharged (e.g. 4G63T), \\"B\\" that this is the second version of the engine (e.g. 4G63B). Where engine codes are used which include the supplemental letters, the first digit denoting the number of cylinders may be omitted, so 4G63T may be seen as G63T. Configurations =Single- cylinder= These were used in Mitsubishi's very first vehicles, motor scooters and three-wheelers. * A-series ‚Äî A 744 cc air-cooled OHV engine installed as the 3A in the 1947 Mitsubishi TM3A three-wheeled truck. The TM6 three-wheeler of 1955 was equipped with an improved 6A engine. * 1952-196? ‚Äî ME10/12 ‚Äî A development of the A family engine (\\"Mizushima Engine\\"). The sidevalve ME10 displaces 886 cc (TM4 and TM5 three-wheeled trucks), while the later, OHV ME12 is of 851 cc. :As fitted to the Mitsubishi \\"Mizushima\\" TM14G three-wheeled truck, the ME12 developed at 3600 rpm. * NE/NE1 ‚Äî \\"Nagoya Engine,\\" First introduced as the 112 cc side-valve, air-cooled 1.5 hp NE10 for the famous Silver Pigeon scooter. Later iterations included the NE7, the enlarged 192 cc NE9, and the OHV 125 cc NE8 and 175 cc NE13. * ME20 ‚Äî This 309 cc water-cooled OHV engine served in the three-wheeled Leo. =Two-cylinder= Mitsubishi's smallest powerplants, most commonly found in their earliest models in the 1960s: * 1955-1962 ‚Äî ME7/15/18 ‚Äî This was Mitsubishi's first air-cooled OHV engine over one liter's displacement. In 1955, the 1276 cc ME7 was developed for the Mitsubishi TM7. The 1145 cc ME15 and the 1489 cc ME18 were premiered in 1958 for the TM15/16 and TM17/18 trucks; production of this engine series ended when Mitsubishi discontinued heavier three-wheeled trucks. * 1960-1962 ‚Äî NE19A ‚Äî 0.5 L ‚Äî The air-cooled 493 cc OHV twin-cylinder engine in the Mitsubishi 500, the first passenger car built by the company after the Second World War. Bore and stroke were 70.0 x 64.0 mm * 1961-1965 ‚Äî NE35A ‚Äî 0.6 L ‚Äî a 594 cc iteration of the NE series, 72.0 x 73.0 mm. This engine was used in the Mitsubishi 500 Super DeLuxe and Mitsubishi Colt 600. * 1961-1976 ‚Äî ME21/24 ‚Äî 0.36 L ‚Äî This air-cooled two-stroke first served in the Mitsubishi 360 but was used in various Minicas until 1972 and in Minicabs until 1976. * 1968-1976 ‚Äî 2G1 ‚Äî 0.36 L ‚Äî First introduced in late first generation Minicas in October 1968 to gradually replace the air-cooled ME24 powerplant.

S.r.l. or Colnago is a manufacturer of high-end road- racing bicycles founded by Ernesto Colnago near Milano in Cambiago, Italy. Instead of following his family's farming business, Ernesto Colnago chose to work in the cycle trade, apprenticing first with Gloria Bicycles at 13, subsequently taking up road racing. After a bad crash ended his racing career, he began subcontracting for Gloria, opened his own shop in 1954, building his first frames the same year.See www.colnago.com\\\\history. While building frames, he remained much in demand as a racing mechanic. He was second mechanic on the Nivea team Giro d'Italia under Faliero Masi in 1955, eventually being employed as head mechanic for the Molteni team of Belgian cycling legend Eddy Merckx in 1963. The company first became known for high quality steel framed bicycles suitable for the demanding environment of professional racing, and later as one of the more creative cycling manufacturers responsible for innovations in design and experimentation with new and diverse materials including carbon fiber, now a mainstay of modern bicycle construction.  History  The signature of Ernesto Colnago, which appears as a decal on all new Colnago bicycles, except the special Ferrari versions. One of the first big victories on a Colnago frame was in 1957, when Gastone Nencini won the 1957 edition of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia bicycle race on a Colnago bicycle. In 1960, Colnago achieved more recognition as Luigi Arienti rode to a gold medal at the Rome Olympics on a Colnago bicycle. By the late 1960s, Colnago was generally regarded as one of the builders of the world's best custom road race frames. While Ernesto was the head mechanic of the Molteni team, riders such as Gianni Motta raced on Colnago bikes. A win on a Colnago in the 1970 Milan-San Remo race by Michele Dancelli for the Molteni team inspired Colnago to change his logo to the now- famous 'Asso di Fiori' or Ace of Clubs. After the demise of the Faema team, Eddie Merckx joined the Molteni team, and what ensued was mutual innovation‚Äîas Colnago describes it: \\"Merckx was an up and coming champion, and I was an up and coming bike builder. So it was a real honour to work for a great champion like Merckx. It helped us to grow... when we made special forks, and special bikes.\\" This included the super-light steel frame used by Merckx in 1972 to break the world one-hour record. With a growing reputation from their racing wins, Colnago plunged into the market for production bikes. In the U.S., the early seventies witnessed another bike boom, and Colnago \\"pumped out bikes as though the future of humankind was at stake.\\" The mainstay of the Colnago line in the 1970s was the Super, followed by the Mexico, named in honor of the successful hour attempt. Other models were added including the Superissimo and Esa Mexico. While the finish on these early Colnagos could be variable, they were great riding bikes and developed a cult-like following. In 1979, Ernesto Colnago presented Pope John Paul II with a custom, gold-plated steel bicycle. In response to criticism that his frames were not stiff enough, next Colnago experimented with ways to change the behavior of frame components. In 1983, he introduced the Oval CX with an oval-shaped top tube to add stiffness. He then experimented with various crimped-tube frames which became production models as their top of the range frames, beginning with the \\"Master.\\" Later \\"Master- Light\\", Master Olympic and Master Pi√π extended the range. Colnago built a frame from Columbus tubing used by Giuseppe Saronni to win the world professional road race championship in 1982, and afterwards a short-lived collection of bikes were badged with the Saronni name. In 1983, Giuseppe Saronni would go on to win the Giro d'Italia stage race on a Colnago bicycle. Since the 1980s, while Colnago continued to produce high-end steel bikes, they began to produce bike frames using material other than steel including titanium, aluminum, carbon and mixed material frames. One unique frame from this period, the Bititan, has a dual titanium down tube. Crimped and oversize tubes appeared on the Tecnosone of the lightest production steel bikes produced, and the same oversize tubes and crimping were used on the aluminum Dream frame. In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pistaa full monocoque carbon fiber bike with disc wheels that was shown at the Milan bike show. Subsequently, Colnago worked with Ferrari in developing new carbon fiber technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago's innovative Precisa straight- bladed steel fork (1987). Colnago also experimented with multi-material frames, including the CT-1 and CT-2 constructed with titanium main tubes, carbon fiber forks and rear stays, and a similarly constructed (although short-lived) Master frame constructed with steel main tubes, carbon forks and stays. Colnago's early attempts at carbon fiber frames were not commercially successful, but the lessons learned were embodied in their flagship frames, such as the C-40, the most sought after bicycle (1994), and its successor, the C-50 (2004)respectively named for Colnago's 40th and 50th years in bike building. These carbon fiber frames set new standards of excellence. They were built using a modified form of traditional bike frame construction, substituting carbon fiber lugs for microinfusion cast steel, and carbon fiber \\"tubes\\" for the complex steel tubes used for steel frame construction. Similar building techniques are used in the latest offering, the C59, named (as before) for its year of production. While we take for granted the spread of carbon frames, their success was not a foregone conclusion: ‚ÄúWhen we built the C40 we were the only ones to build carbon frames and all the mechanics and competitor technicians were saying that they would be too dangerous to use on cobbled roads, especially with the straight carbon forks. There was a company that wanted to fit suspension forks on the bicycle, but I wasn‚Äôt going to have suspension forks on the C40. The night before Paris- Roubaix I had Mr. Squinzi, the Mapei boss, on the phone to me raising his concerns about using such a delicate-looking thing. I told him that we‚Äôd done all of the tests that we could on the frame and the fork and we were certain there would be no problem. I had to take personal responsibility for what was going to happen and I spent all night worrying about it, barely able to sleep. But when I heard that there were 4 Mapei riders in the break, I knew I could relax.‚Äù The C40 went on to win 5 editions of Paris-Roubaix in 6 years. An interview with Ernesto Colnago in which he describes various iconic Colnagos (filmed in the factory museum) is available on YouTube here. On May 4, 2020, it was announced that the UAE-based investment company, Chimera Investments LLC had acquired majority of the Colnago stakes from Ernesto Colnago, although the headquarter will remain located in Italy since the acquisition. The victory of Tadej Pogaƒçar in the 2020 edition of the Tour de France marked the first time a Colnago-branded bicycle was ridden by the overall classification winner. Trademark Colnago uses a black symbol similar to the ‚ô£ (\\"Clubs\\") symbol used on playing cards. Colnago frames' graphics evolved from a font with gravitas to elaborate and/or creative paint. Colnago sponsored bicycle racing teams since 1968 Colnago jersey Colnago has sponsored at least one professional team every year since 1974, often sponsoring more than one. In addition, other teams in the peloton have competed on Colnago bikes. Probably the most famous was the Molteni team which included Eddy Merckx, but the world champion, Giuseppe Saronni also rode Colnago bikes throughout his career, from 1977 with Scic, later with Gis Gelati and with Colnago-Del Tongo. Colnago was well known as a sponsor of the legendary Mapei cycling team throughout the 1990s. For 2005, Colnago sponsored the professional cycling team Rabobank. Colnago has also been the bike sponsor for the American domestic team, Navigators for whom the Australian sprinter Hilton Clarke was a member 2005‚Äì2008. For 2006, Team Milram joined their list of professionally sponsored teams featuring well-known Alessandro Petacchi and Erik Zabel. In addition, Colnago serves as a co-title sponsor of the Landbouwkrediet-Colnago professional cycling team that competes on the UCI Europe Tour and was the official frame supplier to Team Tinkoff in 2007. Starting in the 2011 Tour de France, Team Europcar has ridden Colnago frames. For 2012, Colnago is sponsoring Colnago-CSF Bardiani. A full list of teams is provided below.

Alan produced some aluminum frames for Colnago in the 1980s, including single and dual downtube road and cyclocross models. In March, 2005, Colnago announced that they were joining the Taiwanese-based A-Team, whose members include Giant, Merida and SRAM‚Äîthe first Italian manufacturer to do so, to produce mid-ranged bicycle models for the Japanese and European markets. Beginning in 2006, Colnago sourced the Primavera and the Arte from Giant Bicycles of Taiwan. Both received favorable reviews, although some thought the shift of manufacturing out of Italy was a matter of some regret. There was some controversy in 2006 over whether Giant would be producing additional models, including carbon frame models, for Colnago. According to statements by Ernesto Colnago this was not the case: : \\"For the 2006 model year, Colnago will be sourcing two entry-level aluminum road bike models from Giant, made to Colnago's spec and frame geometry and for sales in Europe and Asia only. All other Colnago bicycles are assembled in Italy. No Colnago carbon fiber frames are made at Giant and none will be, as Mr. Colnago has a long-term sourcing agreement in place with ATR for carbon fiber bicycle frames.\\"John Crenshaw, \\"Colnago Rebutts Sourcing Reports,\\" Bicycle Retailer and Industry News, August 15, 2005. Excepted here: http://business.highbeam.com/103/article-1G1-135579315/colnago-rebutts- sourcing-reports Despite this denial, since 2007 Colnago's carbon monocoque CLX frame has been manufactured in Taiwan. In 2008, a second Colnago carbon fiber model, the CX-1 was also sourced in Taiwan. The top of the line Colnago frame, the C64, as well as the Master, and the now discontinued C60, C59, C50, Extreme Power, Extreme C are (or were) manufactured and painted in Italy. In a series of public statements, Colnago has insisted that all designs originate with the Italian design team, claiming that the essence of what makes a Colnago is design. The mid-range carbon offerings are currently being sourced from Taiwan, (as are many bicycle manufacturers' offerings), and as of 2011, the M10 (which stands second in the model lineup) is made in Taiwan and assembled and painted in Italy, while the CX-1 is completely made in Taiwan. The current top of the line frame, the C64 is the only carbon frame still made fully in Italy.

A handful have been identified, an early one based on the Colnago Super and built for Roger de Vlaeminck. Photos are available here. This frame sold in November 2012 on eBay for approximately $1200 US. Three or four additional Super CX bikes have also been identified.1985 Super Cyclocross Team Kwantum Decosol , ex Adrie Van Der Poel Another frame surfaced a couple of years ago, and appears to have been built in the mid to late 90s, loosely based on the Colnago Crystal, specifically labeled \\"Master\\" on the rear brake hanger. Lugs and seat stays are similar to those on the Crystal, slightly beefier tubing than other road models (32mm OD downtube, 29mm seattube), relaxed wheelbase, top tube routing for rear brake and derailleur, traditional routing for front derailleur but no braze-on for front derailleur. Colnago bottom bracket shell. Straight mtb style threadless fork (no formal crown). No serial number stamped on dropout. Colnago factory contact unable to identify year or provide further information. Photos are available here. Colnago built a couple of bikes for the Italian cyclocross and MTB champion Luca Bramati. Bramati rode a yellow steel, lugless Colnago cyclocross bike in the '96 Worlds in Munich, considered to be one of the most exciting races ever, where he placed third. His bike had a front fork with a traditional brazed fork crown, and full front/rear gear cable brazings. The tubing looks just slightly oversized, and overall the bike looks quite similar to Bramati's Colnago MTB that he raced in Atlanta in the '96 Olympics. Another may have been built for Bert Hiemstra in 1998/1999, Rabobank rider. This was a lugless steel frame, badged \\"Colnago Competition\\" in Rabobank colors, 59 cm CtT, set up with 9 speed Dura Ace and a unicrown fork. Sold in the UK in 2012. * Cyclocross (c 1980s) Manufactured by Alan, stamped \\"Colnago\\" name on bottom of headtube. Aluminum tubing screwed and glued to lugs. Sizing stamped in bottom bracket, no serial number on rear dropouts. Top tube ovalized for shouldering bike on transitions.

Austria was severely shaken the previous year 1866 by the crushing defeat that the Austrian army suffered in the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz and many of the year's festivities and balls were cancelled as the prevalent depressing mood affected most of Vienna's populace. Strauss's near impossible task of injecting the same joie de vivre into the Vienna Carnival of 1867 was met with great aplomb by all three Strauss brothers as their works displayed no signs of dying inspiration, and in turn introducing to the Viennese how their creative spirit defied the troubled spirit of the times. Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss both presented sparkling new works at the 'Hesperus' Ball which was held at the Dianabad-Saal on 18 February 1867, with the \\"Artist's Life\\" waltz presented just three nights after the successful performance of \\"The Blue Danube\\" at the same venue. The 'Hesperus' Association known as the Vienna Artists' Association was a well-known and influential society of which all three Strauss brothers were members. The new waltz was quickly heralded as a new 'twin' of \\"The Blue Danube\\" and its popularity has since been retained in the classical music repertoire. The composer's best inspiration can be seen in the Introduction of the waltz, which begins with a plaintive horn solo and a quietly dramatic string passage in A minor. A pensive waltz melody in A major is introduced, before being cut short by two loud and fierce chords. The first waltz section is then played, with a high-spirited tune and a robust accompanying waltz passage. The second waltz section is a melancholic tune in two parts, with the same dramatic chords as heard in the Introduction before a more upbeat tune heralds the entry of the happier third section. The plaintive mood of the waltz continues in the fifth section before the minor-sounding Coda. The first waltz melody makes another quiet entrance before the waltz is brought to its triumphant close, with a strong chord and flourish, underlined by a snare-drumroll.

It is located next to the A10 just north of Royston. Melbourn has over 4,400 inhabitants. Melbourn is located in the South Cambridgeshire district, but is served by the Royston, Hertfordshire post town. The Prime Meridian passes to the west of Melbourn. History The parish has a long history of occupation, stemming from the presence of springs at Melbourn Bury and the several ancient trackways that cross the parish; the Icknield Way runs to the south of the parish and Ashwell Street and the Roman Cambridge-Royston road are also believed to follow prehistoric trackways. Pottery and burial finds show evidence of Bronze Age residents, and a Roman settlement has been found at the north-east edge of the village. Excavations in the 1950s discovered 28 graves from a 7th-century Christian burial site close to Ashwell Street. Melbourn appears in five entries in Domesday Book.http://opendomesday.org/place/TL3844/melbourn/ The name \\"Melbourn\\" comes from Meldeburn, the \\"stream of a man named Melde\\". Church The finding of a Saxon cemetery shows that Christianity has been present in Melbourn since the 7th century. The village also probably had an 11th-century chapel but the first record of a church is from 1152. The present church, dedicated to All Saints, is grade II* listed. R.R. Rowe conducted a major restoration in 1882 but the church includes sections of the 13th-century building, including the chancel arch and sections of the tower. The font is 11th century. Village life It has a primary school and a state secondary school, Melbourn Village College. There is also a well-known science park. There is a butcher's, a co- op food shop, five hairdressers, a barber shop, two estate agents, two pubs, a newsagent, a sub-post office, two garages and three churches (Anglican, Baptist and URC). Melbourn has the well-known restaurant Sheene Mill, formerly owned by the television chef Stephen Saunders. The nearest station is , in the neighbouring village, which opened in 1851 on the Cambridge line. =Pubs= Melbourn was much visited by travellers by the 17th century and is listed as having an inn in 1622. By the late 18th century the village supported three: the Dog, of unknown history, the Red Lion, that closed towards the end of the 19th century, and the Hoops, that closed in the early 20th century. In 1865 the village had 11 inns and pubs, including the Black Horse, the Star, the White Lion, the Anchor, the Carriers Arms and the Red Cow. The Rose Inn and the Coach and Horses opened in around 1850. The oldest of the two present public houses is the Dolphin, which is listed from 1818. The other pub in the village is the Black Horse.

Its name comes from the brewery located in the Upper Silesian town of Tychy. It is brewed by the Tychy Princely Brewery (Polish Tyskie Browary KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôce), part of the Kompania Piwowarska brewery group, which was acquired by Asahi Group Holdings in 2017.Asahi Forks Over $7.8 Billion for 5 of AB InBev‚Äôs Beer Brands, Fortune 2016-12-13 Beers The main brands are Tyskie Gronie (pale lager). History The brewery is one of the oldest in Europe and at their location in Tychy withstood numerous historical border partitions of Poland. Beer has been produced in Tychy continuously for almost 400 years. From 1629, the brewery, then known in German as the \\"F√ºrstliche Brauerei Tichau\\" (Princely Brewery Tychy), was in the ownership of the German noble . From 1861, the brewery became known as the \\"F√ºrstliche Brauerei in Tichau\\" (Princely Brewery in Tychy) and came under the management of from the German princely (German F√ºrsten) House of Pless. Between 1918 and 1939, the brewery merged with neighbouring competing companies, but came under provisional administration of the Polish state intermittently from 1934 due to unpaid taxes. During World War II, the brewery was put under the management of the occupying authorities. Types of beer produced In its beginnings, the brewery produced three kinds of beer: mailings, yeast and tableware. Only the high quality beer was intended for sale, and the other two were a beer allowance drunk mainly by brewers and their families. In the early nineteenth century the brewery produced only two beverages: beer and Bavarian malt, both top-fermenting. Bavarian malt with a classical composition, saturated color was brown, sweet, and low-hopped. The standard favorite was the dark niskoekstraktowe, weak and only for immediate consumption. After the expansion of the brewery in the nineteenth century and the introduction of bottom-fermenting, they started to produce Tyskie lager, a relatively short Bavarian beer. The first beers were light and were sold under the KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôce brand. In the interwar period, popular brands from Tyskie were the KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôce Tyskie Pilsen (Princely Tychy Pilsner), the KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôce Tyskie Export, the KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôce Tyskie Beer full, and Tyskie Porter. Export Tyskie is one of the leading brands of beer in Poland, with around 18% of the Polish market.http://www.sabmiller.com/index.asp?pageid=149&newsid;=1186 SABMiller News & Media Tyskie also has a large export distribution through its parent company.

Biography Eagleson was born in Los Angeles, California, and educated in the public schools. After serving in World War II, Eagleson earned his law degree from the USC Law School in 1950. On June 6, 1951, he was admitted to the State Bar of California. Eagleson then practiced law in Long Beach, California for 20 years. In December 1970, Governor Ronald Reagan appointed Eagleson to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where from 1980 to 1981 he served as presiding judge.

In March 1987, Governor Deukmejian appointed Eagleson as an Associate Justice to the Supreme Court. A conservative Republican, Eagleson was elevated to the high court after voters removed liberal Chief Justice Rose Bird and two of her allies from the Court in the 1986 general election as a result of the trio's opposition to capital punishment. Eagleson tended to uphold capital sentences. During his four years on the court, Eagleson wrote 54 majority opinions. Among Eagleson's notable opinions is Thing v. La Chusa (1989),Thing v. La Chusa, 48 Cal. 3d 644, 667 (1989). which sharply limited the availability of the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress in California. After stepping down from the high court, Eagleson practiced as a mediator and arbitrator in Los Angeles. Personal life On May 16, 1953, Eagleson married Virginia Mae Brown, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth K. Eagleson, an attorney, and Victoria Eagleson, who both reside in Southern California. Beth, in her eulogy for her father delivered before the court on which he once served, cited Thing as the opinion most representative of her father's voice and philosophy: References External links David N.

The subsidiary was originally an independent company founded by \\"Chief Inspector\\" Robert Stephens on June 16, 1994, and offers various computer-related services and accessories for residential and commercial clients. In 2002, they merged with Best Buy, retaining Stephens as the primary corporate leadership for the subsidiary. The Geek Squad provides services in-store, on-site, and over the Internet via remote access, and also provides 24-hour telephone and emergency on-site support. Geek Squad no longer works solely on computer-related devices. It now diagnoses issues in and repairs all consumer electronics, as well as appliances. Locations and partnerships Geek Squad in Canada Geek Squad precincts exist in most Best Buy stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and the Netherlands. They offer in-store, in-home, online, and remote/over the phone services. Best Buy terminated its partnership with Office Depot in Orlando, Florida, where Geek Squad precincts were located in 10 Office Depot locations.Tomassi, K. \\"Best Buy Drives Geek Squad Via Office Depot\\", Forbes online. Retrieved on December 1, 2006. The brand is also located in select FedEx Office locations. In October 2006, it was reported that Geek Squad would be launching in the United Kingdom in a joint 50-50 venture with Carphone Warehouse, where today it exists as both an onsite service and a remote repair service. It is now fully operational with onsite services in Greater London, the Home Counties, the South Coast and North West areas of England, with phone and remote support undertaken from Tulketh Mill in Preston (Lancashire) and repairs completed at a site in Wednesbury (West Midlands). From November 2015 repairs will be completed at a Dixons Carphone repair center based in Newark (East Midlands) In 2008 Best Buy partnered with online tech support provider SupportSpace to offer remote Virtual Agent services to its clients. SupportSpace was founded in 2006 and provided immediate online tech support services. On July 15, 2013, all Geek Squad business was transferred away from SupportSpace and moved in house to Geek Squad agents. A 2013 agreement with Atomic Learning, Inc. provides all Geek Squad tech subscribers with access to over 60,000 on-demand tutorial training videos.http://blogs.atomiclearning.com/atomic-learning-teams-geek-squad- learning-tools-tech-support-program-members Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy's collaboration company, Best Buy Europe, that also own Phone House, has since also begun launching Geek Squad in Phone House stores.

It's still in a startup phase in most of the countries. =Total Services= In 2007, Geek Squad officially added Magnolia Home Theater installation teams as well as Best Buy Mobile Installers to the Geek Squad brand. The change was titled, \\"Total Services\\" and was aimed towards the combination of major Best Buy services into one cohesive unit. Best Buy mobile installers and Magnolia Home Theater installers have now switched from their previous grey and blue uniforms to grey and orange shirts with grey cargo pants. This change removed all \\"Magnolia Home Theater Installation\\" branding and was replaced by \\"Geek Squad Installation Units\\" instead. This has now allowed Geek Squad to incorporate home theater installation as one of the in home services offered via telephone. Staff Older traditional Geek Squad logo from prior to 2016. Mark Atlan is featured on the mobile application and the current spokesperson for Geek Squad. Geek Squad employees are known as Agents and are assigned titles similar to those used by intelligence agencies - Counter Intelligence Agent (CIA), Deputy of Counter Intelligence (DCI), Double Agent-Covert (DAC), Covert Agent (CA), Special Agent (SA), Deputy Covert Operations (DCO) and Deputy Field Marshal (DFM), to name a few. Unlike most computer repair facilities, Best Buy US does not require any industry certifications for its in-store technicians. However, Best Buy Canada requires at least A+ Certification to work as a CIA. They also require MECP certification for all technical mobile electronics installers. In-Store positions have long since changed, now only consisting of Consultation Agent (CA), Advanced Repair Agent (ARA), Geek Squad Sr (CIA Sr) and Geek Squad Manager (GSM). =Uniforms and vehicles= Geekmobile in Maryland Geek Squad Chevrolet Express in Vermont, which are no longer used. Ford E-350 cutaway in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In-store PC agents, and in-home PC field agents, wear a white, short-sleeved, pocketless dress shirt. Agents are required to wear a black clip-on tie with the Geek Squad logo pin. Male agents wear black trousers, white socks and black lace-up shoes that used to have the Geek Squad logo on the sole. Female agents may wear either black trousers, white socks, and black shoes; or, a black skirt with hose and black shoes. White and black are the only colors allowed in Geek Squad uniforms. Agents who have served in an eligible capacity within any branch of Geek Squad for eighteen months, or who have held certain positions prior to 2014 including on-site Double Agents, Special Agents, and Deputies of Counter Intelligence carry a metal police-style badge with their Agent Number engraved on it. In October 2019 the Dress Code Policy for Best Buy was updated, with this update an alternate uniform option was introduced for Geek Squad Agents allowing them to wear the black Geek Squad polo along with jeans and sneakers. The Minnesota Historical Society added the official uniform to its permanent collection in 2000. Geek Squad Autotechs and GSIs (Home Theater Installers) wear a grey button-up work shirt or black short sleeved and collared dress shirt with the Geek Squad logo on the front and optional certification patches on the arms. Matching pants or shorts are worn as well as a bright orange undershirt. These agents also have the option of wearing a grey Geek Squad hat and/or black Geeks Squad nylon jacket. Prior to 2016, Double Agents and Special Agents drove black-and-white Volkswagen New Beetles (dubbed \\"Geekmobiles\\") with an orange-and-black company logo on the door. Geekmobiles in California are all-black with white roof and running boards due to a request by the California Highway Patrol that the vehicles no longer resemble the paint scheme of their police vehicles (a violation of California law). In 2016, Geek Squad began phasing out the New Beetles and replacing them with Toyota Prius Cs. Due to a number of financial issues, including a large number of parking tickets and thousands of dollars lost for parking garage fees the Geekmobile program was ended in Manhattan New York City Geek Squad Precincts. The Double Agent program in the UK ceased in late 2012. All technical support services continued in store or via Mission Control, Tulketh Mill. From here, the Covert or Covert Operations Agent title was established, Agents from Covert Operations are responsible for the technical support of desktop or laptop devices. They provide support for narrow range of approved issues verbally over the phone, or Agents will connect to clients devices remotely and fix any issues if the computer is able to connect to the internet. Geek Squad City Located in Brooks, Kentucky, Geek Squad City is the largest Geek Squad computer repair site at 240,000 square feet. Controversy Geek Squad technicians have been caught on numerous occasions searching and copying pornographic content stored on their clients' computers without permission. When asked about the incident, Geek Squad founder Robert Stephens refused to discuss the topic and focused on whether bloggers should be considered true journalists. At least one former Geek Squad employee had come forward with allegations that the practice of surreptitiously searching for pornography on their clients' computers is not restricted to isolated employees, but is often shared with management. Geek Squad employees have allegedly engaged in peeping tom activities on female customers during in-house service visits. A 2007 case alleges that a Geek Squad employee used his cell phone to record a 22-year-old female customer while she showered without her knowledge or permission. The employee was arrested and Best Buy was sued over the incident. In another case, a Geek Squad employee allegedly stole nude photographs of a 27-year-old female customer from her computer while it was being serviced. The employee then allegedly shared the photos on the internet. In 2002, during a spate of legal threats and challenges to competitors with \\"geek\\" in their names, Geek Squad attempted to block the trademark registration of New England area competitor Geek Housecalls claiming that it violated their trademarks. When Geek Housecalls refused to budge, Geek Squad filed civil suit. After two years of wrangling, Geek Squad and Geek Housecalls arrived at an out-of-court settlement, the details of which cannot be disclosed according to the terms of the settlement except to state that Geek Housecalls retained its name. In 2006, Geek Squad was sued for allegedly using unauthorized copies of Winternals' Emergency Repair Disk Commander. The lawsuit filed by Austin-based Winternals claims that employees of Geek Squad have continued using the unlicensed versions of the software after the commercial licensing agreement broke off. Best Buy and Geek Squad were accused of copyright infringement, circumvention of copyright infringement systems, and misappropriation of trade secrets. A settlement was eventually reached, and Winternals created a three- year agreement in place with Best Buy, allowing Geek Squad employees to lawfully use their licensed programs, including the ERD Commander. In 2010, Best Buy issued a trademark infringement cease and desist letter against a priest in Wisconsin for painting \\"God Squad\\" on his car. In 2013, Geek Squad was sued for invasion of privacy and several other civil infractions for allegedly releasing nude images found on a customer's computer. The suit is ongoing. In June 2015, the court denied Best Buy's motions for summary judgment on all claims except the claim for \\"negligence/wantonness.\\" On March 7, 2018, NPR reported that \\"FBI Used Paid Informants On Best Buy's Geek Squad To Flag Child Pornography\\" according to a document that was released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo- way/2018/03/07/591698708/fbi-used-paid-informants-on-best-buys-geek-squad-to- flag-child-pornography References External links Follow our Youtube Videos Category:Best Buy Category:Dixons Carphone Category:American companies established in 1994 Category:Business services companies established in 1994 Category:Technology companies established in 1994 Category:Business services companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Minnesota ","title":"Geek Squad"},{"id":"1259804","title":"Yvonne Brathwaite Burke"},{"id":"1259805","text":"Mike Dringenberg (born ) is an American comics artist best known for his work on DC Comics/Vertigo's Sandman series with writer Neil Gaiman. Early life Mike Dringenberg was born in Laon, France. Career Dringenberg first work in the comics industry was the story \\"A Tale Of... Lenny's Casino & Grill\\" in Kelvin Mace #1 (Dec. 1985) published by Vortex Comics. His other early work in the 1980s for publishers such as Eclipse Comics included Alien Worlds, Enchanter, and Total Eclipse. He worked on Adolescent Radioactive Blackbelt Hamsters, a parody of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which itself was a parody of many then-current comic books, and Shock the Monkey. His mainstream work includes DC's Doom Patrol with writer Grant Morrison, where he co-created Flex Mentallo; the fantasy card game Magic: The Gathering; and White Wolf Publishing's card game Vampire: The Eternal Struggle. Death, from The Sandman #8 (Aug. 1989), drawn by Mike Dringenberg and inker Malcolm Jones III. Dringenberg came to prominence for his work on The Sandman, where he started as the series' inker over pencil art by Sam Kieth but switched to pencilling when Kieth left after the fifth issue.Tousley, Nancy (October 12, 1991). \\"Artist draws a 'cinema for the page'\\", Calgary Herald, p. B9. He drew eleven issues, all but one inked by Malcolm Jones III, and his understated, realistic style did much to establish the tone of the series. He co-created the popular character Death,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 240: \\"Neil Gaiman, aided by penciller Mike Dringenberg, introduced the character Death to a fascinated readership...Death was an instant hit and arguably became more popular than the Sandman himself.\\" whom he based on Cinamon Hadley, a woman he knew from the dance clubs in Salt Lake City, Utah. Gaiman had imagined her looking like Louise Brooks or Nico, but ultimately preferred Dringenberg's version. Dringenberg stated in a 2014 interview that \\"None of the characters are direct renderings of individual people; they're composites emerging from my memories; case in point, while my friend Cinamon was a primary visual inspiration for Death, she never actually posed for me as the character while I worked on the series. Most of the time, my girlfriend Givette and my friends McAnn and Nyssa actually posed and they each brought their own personalities to the task.\\" He co-created Desire, basing his/her appearance on the work of Patrick Nagel, and had a hand in much of the character design apparent in the early series. Dringenberg's work appears in the Sandman collections \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\", \\"The Doll's House\\" and \\"Season of Mists\\". He is credited in every printing as being one of the series' creators, as he is responsible for the iconic representation of many of the principal characters. In 2008, he was one of the artists for Tori Amos' Comic Book Tattoo anthology graphic novel. Dringenberg is an illustrator of book jackets and CD covers, most notably for various books by J. R. R. Tolkien, Kij Johnson, Charles de Lint, Kage Baker, and San Francisco's Big City Orchestra. He did interior decorations for Sharyn November's Firebirds Soaring (2009). Personal life Dringenberg lives in Bountiful, Utah.

The waltz's melodies were drawn from his first- ever operetta Indigo und die vierzig R√§uber (Indigo and the Forty Thieves). It was his first attempt at ensuring that the more memorable melodies from the stage works would survive obscurity by finding new life as a new orchestral work, a practice which he would faithfully retain in future stage works. Such a move would also benefit sheet music publishers who can sell the piano editions of the new works to the public who can readily identify individual music pieces. Nonetheless, the charming waltz was to incorporate the more popular numbers from the operetta itself, with the melody Ja, so singt man comprising the entire infectious first waltz section. The graceful second section was contributed from the Act 2 Bacchanal Lasst frei nun erschallen das Lied aus der Brust.

The first waltz section is robust and energetic, with a Trio section of comparatively less-rigorous section. The famous second waltz section is a swirling waltz passage in C major, with a high-spirited fashion. The third waltz section is considerably gentler, with a fierce but exciting Coda or tail-piece. The first waltz theme makes a hesitant entry again, accelerating into its breathless and brilliant conclusion, with repeated chords, with a strong drumroll and brass flourish.

It entered into force on August 1, 1980 and led to a significant harmonization of patent laws across European countries. This Convention establishes patentability criteria, i.e. specifies on which grounds inventions can be rejected as not patentable. Its intent was to harmonize substantive patent law but not procedural law. This Convention is quite different from the European Patent Convention (EPC), which establishes an independent system for granting European patents. The Strasbourg Convention has had a significant impact on the EPC, on national patent laws across Europe, on the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), on the Patent Law Treaty (PLT) and on the WTO's TRIPS.  Ratifications and accessions  Thirteen countries ratified the treaty or acceded to it: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Republic of Macedonia, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

Born in Ottawa, Ontario, he was the son of John Bassett (1886‚Äì1958), publisher of the Montreal Gazette, and Marion Avery (n√©e Wright). Education Bassett attended Ashbury College and graduated from Bishop's University with a BA in 1936. Politics After fighting with the Army in World War II, Bassett ran unsuccessfully for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, in the 1945 Canadian election in the riding of Sherbrooke, losing to Liberal incumbent, Maurice Gingues. He also ran in the 1962 election in the riding of Spadina losing to Liberal candidate Perry Ryan by less than 2,000 votes. Publishing and broadcasting He became a reporter for Toronto's The Globe and Mail newspaper after graduating from university. After World War II, he was hired by the Toronto Telegram as advertising director. His first experience in newspaper ownership was with the Sherbrooke Daily Record, which he bought from his father. In 1952, Bassett purchased part ownership of the Toronto Telegram. In 1960, he founded Baton Broadcasting to run Toronto's first commercial television station, CFTO-TV. A few months later, he won the television rights to the Eastern Conference of the Canadian Football League. He needed a network in order to broadcast the games. The result was the Canadian Television Network, later to become CTV, with CFTO as the flagship station. Starting in the 1980s, Bassett began a drive to take over CTV by buying as many stations as possible. He succeeded in 1997, a year before his death. Sports From 1957 to 1974, Bassett was the owner of the Toronto Argonauts, a team in the Canadian Football League. In 1957, he was named to the \\"Silver Seven,\\" a committee that oversaw hockey operations for the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1961, longtime Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe sold most of his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. (which owned the Maple Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens) to a partnership of his son Stafford, Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard and Bassett for $2.3 million. Conn later claimed that he thought he was selling only to his son, but it is very unlikely that Stafford would have been able to raise the money on his own. Bassett became chairman of the Gardens' board of directors, when Smythe resigned shortly after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962. Bassett's name appears on the Stanley Cup 4 times 1962, 1963, 1964, 1967. In 1969, Ballard and Stafford Smythe were charged with tax evasion and accused of using Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for their personal expenses. Bassett persuaded the board to fire Smythe as president and Ballard as executive vice president. The board elected Bassett as the new president. However, Bassett did not force Smythe and Ballard to sell their shares, and they both remained on the board. That was a serious strategic blunder on Bassett's part; Smythe was still the largest shareholder, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the shares between them. A year later, Ballard and Smythe staged a proxy war to win back control. Faced with an untenable situation, Bassett resigned and sold his shares to Smythe and Ballard. Bassett's son, John F. Bassett, would follow in his father's path of becoming a professional sports owner; the younger Bassett was a part owner of the World Hockey Association's Ottawa Nationals, Toronto Toros and Birmingham Bulls; the World Football League's Memphis Southmen and the United States Football League's Tampa Bay Bandits. Government In 1989, he was appointed for a three-year term as chairman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, an independent body that reports to the Parliament of Canada on the operations of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Due to the requirements under the Official Secrets Act, Bassett was sworn into the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. Family Bassett married fellow Bishop's University graduate Eleanor Moira Bradley of Sherbrooke on April 26, 1938 in the University's St. Mark's Chapel.\\"BASSETT-BRADLEY\\" collections2.banq.qc.ca (transcript of the April 28, 1938 The Record) June 24, 2018 They had three children: John, Doug, and David. After their divorce, Bassett married Isabel Bassett on July 17, 1967.\\"Isabel Glenthorne Macdonald\\" bassettbranches.org June 24, 2018 They had three children (Avery, Sarah, and Matthew) and remained together until his death.

I-695 is officially designated the McKeldin Beltway, but is colloquially referred to as either the Baltimore Beltway or 695. The route is an auxiliary route of I-95, intersecting that route southwest of Baltimore near Arbutus and northeast of the city near White Marsh. It also intersects other major roads radiating from the Baltimore area, including I-97 near Glen Burnie, the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway (Maryland Route 295, MD 295) near Linthicum, I-70 near Woodlawn, I-795 near Pikesville, and I-83 in the Timonium area. The portion of the Baltimore Beltway between I-95 northeast of Baltimore and I-97 south of Baltimore is officially MD 695, and is not part of the Interstate Highway System, but is signed as I-695. This section of the route includes the Francis Scott Key Bridge that crosses over the Patapsco River. The bridge and its approaches are maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) while the remainder of the Baltimore Beltway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). The Baltimore Beltway was first planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state eventually took over the project and it became part of the Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US 40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD 702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The Star-Spangled Banner, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD 695\\\\. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed in 2014 to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95, and construction took place in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway crossovers here. Route description =Curtis Creek to I-95= Starting at the zero milepost in Baltimore, I-695, which at this point is officially called MD 695 and is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority, is four lanes wide. The route passes over Curtis Creek on a pair of drawbridges here, which have of vertical navigational clearance and provide access for tall ships to a U.S. Coast Guard base further upstream. Continuing west through industrial areas into Anne Arundel County, the route encounters the northern terminus of MD 10 (Arundel Expressway) at a directional interchange, where maintenance switches to the Maryland State Highway Administration. The interchange includes access to the next interchange, with MD 2 (Ritchie Highway), a major north-south route between Baltimore and the southern suburbs, in Glen Burnie. This interchange has access to northbound MD 2 in both directions and from northbound MD 2 to the westbound direction. Beyond MD 2, I-695 encounters I-895B, a short connector to I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway); this interchange provides access to southbound MD 2 from both directions and to the eastbound direction from southbound MD 2. Immediately past this interchange, I-695 comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of I-97, which terminates on the Beltway. At this point, the route officially becomes I-695. Inner Loop signage along the beltway between Exits 9 and 10 in Halethorpe The route continues west as a six-lane freeway, heading west into residential areas of Linthicum. It interchanges with MD 648 (Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard), where 132,330 vehicles travel I-695 every day, before turning northwest and intersecting MD 170 (Camp Meade Road) and passing over MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. The route encounters the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway (MD 295) at a cloverleaf interchange where the route‚Äôs signage changes from east-west to north-south at this interchange. It turns more to the north from here and heads into commercial areas, interchanging with MD 168 (Nursery Road) and Hammonds Ferry Road. Past this interchange, the route crosses the Patapsco River into Baltimore County and soon encounters a partial interchange with I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with access only from the southbound direction of I-695 to I-895 northbound and from I-895 southbound to the northbound direction of I-695. Past this interchange, I-695 heads north, interchanging with Hollins Ferry Road in Lansdowne before passing under CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and coming to an interchange with US 1 Alt. (Washington Boulevard) in Arbutus. A short distance later, I-695 comes to a semidirectional interchange with I-95. =I-95 to I-70= I-695 southbound at its southern junction with I-95 in Arbutus Catonsville I-695 widens to nine lanes past interchange with I-95, with five lanes in the southbound direction and four lanes in the northbound direction. Running northwest, it crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and comes to a partial interchange with US 1 (Southwestern Boulevard), with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. From here, it continues northwest through residential areas of Catonsville to an interchange with MD 372 (Wilkens Avenue). Narrowing to eight lanes total, with four lanes in each direction, beyond MD 372, the route continues through suburban neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with MD 144 (Frederick Road). At this point, I-695 narrows to seven lanes, with three southbound lanes and four northbound lanes. It continues north and interchanges with Edmondson Avenue before turning northwest and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) near the defunct Westview Mall, now a big-box complex. Beyond US 40, I-695 continues north through residential areas, narrowing to six lanes, with three lanes in each direction, before coming to a four-level stack interchange with I-70 in Woodlawn. =I-70 to I-83= I-695 westbound near split with I-83 southbound northwest of Baltimore The Baltimore Beltway narrows from seven to six lanes within the interchange, which contains braided ramps providing access to the next interchange, MD 122 (Security Boulevard), located near the Security Square Mall and the headquarters of the Social Security Administration. Continuing north, the road widens to eight lanes again and continues through a mix of suburban homes and business parks in Lochearn. I-695 interchanges with MD 26 (Liberty Road) east of Randallstown and resumes north, narrowing to six lanes. It intersects the southern terminus of I-795 (Northwest Expressway), which serves as a bypass of MD 140 in the Owings Mills area. MTA Maryland's Baltimore Metro SubwayLink line to Owings Mills passes under I-695 within the interchange and runs in the median of I-795 as far as that town. At the I-795 interchange, the signage of route changes from north-south to east-west. From here, I-695 heads northeast as an eight lane road and enters Pikesville, where it passes under CSX's Hanover Subdivision and intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at a single-point urban interchange. A short distance later, the road comes to a partial interchange with MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue), with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. I-695 heads east to another partial interchange with Stevenson Road, which has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. The Baltimore Beltway passes through heavily forested land as it encounters Greenspring Avenue. Past this interchange, I-695 continues northeast through woodland before coming to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The interchange includes connections to MD 25 (Falls Road), which heads into the open countryside north of Baltimore. Within this interchange, I-83 forms a concurrency with I-695 and the roadway widens to ten lanes, with six for the Beltway and four for I-83. After running concurrently, I-83 splits from I-695 by heading north on the Harrisburg Expressway at a directional interchange. =I-83 to I-95= The then-under-construction interchange between I-95 and I-695 northeast of Baltimore Beyond I-83, I-695 passes over MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink and turns southeast as a six lane road, heading into Towson. Here, the road comes to an interchange with MD 139 (Charles Street). The Baltimore Beltway heads through residential and commercial areas before coming to interchanges with MD 45 (York Road) near The Shops at Kenilworth and MD 146 (Dulaney Valley Road). Continuing east, the Baltimore Beltway passes to the north of Goucher College and comes to an interchange with Providence Road. I-695 turns southeast through residential areas past Providence Road and comes to an interchange with MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard) and Cromwell Bridge Road. The road continues towards Parkville, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with MD 41 (Perring Parkway) within commercial areas. The Baltimore Beltway continues through residential areas into Carney, coming to another cloverleaf interchange with MD 147 (Harford Road). Continuing east into White Marsh, the route encounters the western terminus of MD 43 (White Marsh Boulevard), a limited-access at-grade boulevard that provides access to White Marsh Mall, US 1 and I-95. I-695 turns south past MD 43 and interchanges with US 1 (Belair Road) south of White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) a short distance after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; at the site of each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did). =I-95 to Curtis Creek= MD 158 (left) running alongside I-695 (right) in Dundalk Continuing south, the Baltimore Beltway officially becomes MD 695 again, despite being signed as I-695, and soon encounters MD 7 (Philadelphia Road). Between I-95 and MD 7, the route‚Äôs changes from east-west to north- south. Immediately after MD 7, the route interchanges with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Essex near The Centre at Golden Ring. After US 40, I-695 crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision and comes to a partial directional interchange with MD 702 (Southeast Boulevard). At this interchange, I-695 turns south onto the Windlass Freeway, crossing over the Northeast Corridor again within the interchange. Running south along the Windlass Freeway, parallel to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice. The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) and MD 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near the Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with MD 151 (North Point Boulevard). From here, the route continues southeast along the Back River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road. The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the Maryland Transportation Authority at the crossing of a CSX rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) before heading west. The route runs past the Sparrows Point Industrial Complex before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned MD 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the Patapsco River Beyond this interchange, the route comes to a two-way all-electronic toll gantry and has a U-turn ramp from the southbound direction to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, HAZMAT trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route‚Äôs signage changes from north-south to east-west. Past this interchange, the Baltimore Beltway continues west and returns to the Curtis Creek drawbridges. =Exit numbering= As opposed to I-495 (Capital Beltway) around Washington, D.C., on which exit numbers are generally arranged by mileposts counterclockwise starting at the southern crossing of the Potomac River, the exit numbers for the Baltimore Beltway are arranged consecutively clockwise starting at Interchange #1 at Quarantine Rd, west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge crossing of the Patapsco River. History View southwest along I-695 from MD 25 in Pikesville The Baltimore County Planning Commission first conceived the Baltimore Beltway as a county- level roadway project in 1949; by 1953 the project was taken over by the state due to slow progress at the county level. The project was included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available. The first part of the Baltimore Beltway to be completed was in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore Beltway would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 finished in 1962. At this time, the original length of the Baltimore Beltway, from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first beltway in the United States built under the Interstate Highway System. A segment of the road completed in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, heading toward the Outer Harbor Crossing. At the northeastern terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend southeast along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south to cross the river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned to be part of it. The first was the Windlass Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973. Ramp stubs for the planned Windlass Freeway are present at the proposed west end at I-95 and Moravia Road,Google Maps, Satellite view of the I-95/Moravia Road interchange and at the present west end at the Southeast Freeway.Google Maps, Satellite view of the I-695/MD 702 interchangeAmerican Automobile Association, Baltimore Triptik insert, 1976 (shows the proposed extensions at each end) The junction of the Windlass and Patapsco Freeways was originally built with provisions for extensions of each, but this has since been reconstructed.Google Maps, Satellite view of the transition between the Windlass Freeway and Patapsco Freeway The Outer Harbor Crossing is the name given to the segment of the Baltimore Beltway that is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority. It consists of the segment of I-695 between Exit 40 (MD 151) and Exit 2 (MD 10), which includes the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The route was originally planned as a two-lane freeway on a four-lane right-of-way, with a two-lane outer harbor tunnel across the Patapsco River. When the tunnel was advertised for construction in 1970, the bids were so high that the decision was made to construct a four- lane bridge instead. The bridge was to feature two-lane approach roads on both sides. Construction on the Outer Harbor Crossing, including the bridge, started in 1972 and was completed on March 23, 1977, completing the full Baltimore Beltway. The bridge was named the Francis Scott Key Bridge in honor of Francis Scott Key, who wrote \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" the national anthem of the United States. By the early 1980s, the southern approach to the Key Bridge was dualized, with a second roadway constructed along with a second drawbridge over Curtis Creek. The northern approach was left as a two-lane viaduct in the Sparrows Point area until a four-lane surface freeway was constructed along this portion, with interchanges reconfigured, following an $89.5 million project completed in January 2000. The Outer Harbor Crossing, as well as the entire Baltimore Beltway east of I-95, was first signposted as MD 695 because portions of it were a two-lane expressway not up to Interstate Highway standards. Improvements to the road have allowed the entire Baltimore Beltway to be signed as I-695, even though all of I-695 between the junction of I-95 northeast of Baltimore and I-97 is officially considered MD 695 by the MDSHA. On June 8, 1999, a tractor-trailer carrying a backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just northwest of the I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime. The Beltway was dedicated in honor of former Governor Theodore R. McKeldin in May 2005. McKeldin was responsible for the construction of the Beltway and other state highways during his term. Most Marylanders still refer to the highway as the \\"Baltimore Beltway,\\" \\"695,\\" or (mostly among Baltimore metro area residents) simply \\"The Beltway,\\" like its Washington counterpart. In March 2009, construction began on the reconstruction of the bridge that carries MD 139 (Charles Street) over I-695. The bridge will be decorative, featuring ornamental street lights. As part of the MD 139 project, the interchange will be reconstructed and the traffic circle at the MD 139/I-695 ramps will be removed and replaced with a traffic signal. This project was expected to cost $50 million and be completed in 2012. Air photo of Exit 33 on August 16, 2010, showing completed flyover ramps. Facing southwest. At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both highways had crossed over themselves so that all through traffic was on the left side of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange was replaced in 2014 by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. The ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 was completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 was completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 was completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95. Future There are long- term plans to add new lanes to I-695 to ease traffic congestion along the northern and western parts of the route between the two interchanges with I-95. These plans would widen the sections between I-95 and I-70 on the west side and between the Jones Falls Expressway and I-95 on the north side. In addition, there are also plans to add a fourth lane between the ramps to I-795, ending the disappearing fourth lanes in this section. A multi-year project to replace the stack interchange at I-70 would allow at least eight lanes to pass under this interchange upon its estimated completion by 2024. All these projects will enable up to ten lanes to be constructed at a future date. Also, ramp meters will be installed at selected entrances within the next five years.

The Merkits lived in the basins of the Selenga and lower Orkhon River (modern south Buryatia and Selenge Province).History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003 After a struggle of over 20 years, they were defeated in 1200 by Genghis Khan and were incorporated into the Mongol Empire.  Etymology  The word Merged (–º—ç—Ä–≥—ç–¥) is a plural form derived from the Mongolian word mergen (–º—ç—Ä–≥—ç–Ω), which means both \\"wise\\" and \\"skillful marksperson\\", as in adept in the use of bow and arrow. The word is also used in many phrases in which it connotes magic, oracles, divination, augury, or religious power. Mongolian language has no clear morphological or grammatical distinction between nouns and adjectives, so mergen may mean \\"a sage\\" as much as \\"wise\\" or mean \\"skillful\\" just as much as \\"a master.\\" Merged becomes plural as in \\"wise ones\\" or \\"skillful markspeople\\". In the general sense, mergen usually denotes someone who is skillful and wise in their affairs.  Three Mergeds  The Mergeds were a confederation of three tribes, inhabiting the basin of the Selenga and Orkhon Rivers. * The Uduyid Merkits lived in Buur-kheer, near the lower Orkhon River; * The Uvas Merkits lived in Tar, between the Orkhon and Selenge Rivers; * The Khaad Merkits (\\"Kings\\" Merkits) lived in Kharaji-kheer, on the Selenge River.  Ethnic relations  The Merkits were related to the Mongols, Naimans, Keraites, and Khitan people.  Conflict with Genghis Khan  Tem√ºjin's mother Hoelun, originally from the Olkhonud, had been engaged to the Merkit chief Yehe Chiledu by 1153. She was abducted by Tem√ºjin's father Yesugei, while being escorted home by Yehe Chiledu. In turn, Tem√ºjin's new wife B√∂rte was kidnapped by Merkit raiders from their campsite by the Onon river around 1181 and given to one of their warriors. Tem√ºjin, supported by his brother (not blood-related) Jamukha and his khan etseg ('khan father') Tooril Khan of the Keraites, attacked the Merkit and rescued B√∂rte within the year. The Mergids were dispersed after this attack. Shortly thereafter she gave birth to a son named Jochi. Tem√ºjin accepted paternity but the question lingered throughout Jochi's life. These incidents caused a strong animosity between Tem√ºjin's family and the Merkits. Over the next two decades, he attacked them several times. By the time he had united the other Mongol tribes and received the title Genghis Khan in 1206, the Mergids seem to have disappeared as an ethnic group. Those who survived were likely absorbed by other Mongol tribes (Oirats, Buryats, Khalkhas) and others who fled to the Kipchaks mixed with them. In 1215‚Äì1218, Jochi and Subutai crushed the remnants of them under their former leader Toghta Beki's family. The Mongols clashed with the Kankalis or the Kipchakss because they had sheltered the Merged. Genghis Khan had a Merged khatun (queen) named Khulan. She died while Mongol forces besieged a Kievan Rus' settlement in Ryazan in 1236. In 1236, during the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria, a body of the Merkit was found in the area of land dominated by the Bulgar and Kipchak.  Late Mergeds  A few Mergeds achieved prominent position among the Mongols, but they were classified as Mongols in Mongolian society. Great Khan Guyuk's beloved khatun Oghul Qaimish, who was a regent from 1248‚Äì1251, was a Merged woman. The traditionalist Bayan and his cousin Toghta served as Grand councilors of the Yuan Dynasty in China and Mongolia. After the fall of the Yuan Dynasty, they were a clan of a banner in Northern Yuan dynasty.

The three classes differed only in cylinder diameter and thus tractive effort, each subsequent class increasing that measurement by an inch. The first H8 was built in 1907 and the last H10 in 1916; within a few years they were replaced on heavy freight assignments by 2-8-2s and 2-10-0. They became the railroad's standard light freight locomotive, replacing all other class H 2-8-0s, and a number remained in service until the end of PRR steam locomotive operation in 1957. 968 class H8 of various subclasses were constructed, along with 274 class H9s and 273 class H10s. A number of H8 locomotives were rebuilt to H9s specification. Class H10s was built primarily for PRR Lines West, and featured a typical Lines West tender with sloping side coal boards at the top, to enable a bigger load of coal to be carried. Some locomotives of this type were leased to the PRR-owned Long Island Rail Road, becoming the primary freight-hauling type on that system.

Within castles they are often called the 'Lords' and 'Ladies Chamber', or the 'Great Chamber'. The word solar has two possible origins: it may derive from the Latin word solaris meaning sun (often a room with the brightest aspect), or - as the solar provided privacy for its occupants, it may come from the Latin word, solus, meaning, \\"alone\\". In some houses, the main ground-floor room was known as the Great hall, in which all members of the household, including tenants, employees and servants, would often or could sometimes eat. Those of highest status would be at the end, often on a raised dais, and those of lesser status further down the hall. But a need was felt for more privacy to be enjoyed by the head of the household, a daytime space to talk and/or read and view part of the grounds, and, especially, by the senior women of the household. The solar was the key inner family room, for seclusion from the hustle, bustle, noise and smell (above all from cooking) of the great hall. Struan Reid The solar was generally smaller than the great hall as not expected to house so many people. It was a room of comfort and status, and usually included a fireplace and often decorative woodwork or tapestries/wall hangings. The solar almost ubiquitous among late castles across the British Isles, such as Broughton Castle, in Oxfordshire, Andor Gomme, Austin Harvey Gomme, Alison Maguire and Stokesay Castle in Shropshire. Anthony Emery In the medieval house of Great Dixter, in East Sussex, it consists of three rooms and a fireplace from the late 15th century. In Windsor Castle its walls are painted green with gold stars. In manor houses of Normandy and northern France,Christopher Gravett the solar was sometimes a separate tower or pavilion, away from the great hall to provide more privacy to the lord and his family. The possibly related term grian√°n (from Irish grian, \\"the sun\\"; often anglicised as \\"greenawn\\") was used in medieval Ireland for a sunny parlour or reception room. Hogan, Kilkenny; the Ancient City of Ossory, 1884, p.271 By extension it was used to refer to any summer palace or noble house. Paradigm examples In England from north to south: * Edlingham Castle in Northumberland, castle in ruins but solar tower is mostly intact. Robert Liddiard (Editor) * Longthorpe Tower, Peterborough, an extension to an existing fortified manor house. * Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, has hall and large solar block later converted into a tower. * Beverston Castle near Tetbury, dating from the 13th century, has a surviving but ruined solar in the south tower of the west range, with a vaulted undercroft below. * Highclere Castle near Newbury -- its suite of rooms used by the owning family are demonstrated in serial drama Downton Abbey. * Great Dixter, in Northiam -- home of the late British gardener and author Christopher Lloyd, has a recreated solar.

Flowers of the genus occur in terminal umbels.John Tenison Salmon, Jason Carter and Geoff Walker. 1986 Taxonomy A 2000 molecular study established that several species within the genus were only distantly related to the core group of New Zealand species related the type species P. crassifolius. They were removed to the genus Raukaua. Distribution and habitat Pseudopanax occur in forest or scrub environments. The genus contains some remarkable small trees with distinctly different juvenile and adult forms, such as Pseudopanax crassifolius and Pseudopanax ferox (commonly referred to as 'lancewood' and 'toothed lancewood', respectively). Pseudopanax arboreus (common name \\"five- finger\\") is a very common small tree in New Zealand native forests. Pseudopanax simplex occurs on the North Island south of the Waihou River; in WestlandC. Michael Hogan. 2009 and other South Island forests; as well as on Stewart Island. Cultivation Many of the species are popular in New Zealand gardens, but are rather rare in cultivation elsewhere, requiring mild, moist conditions similar to those in New Zealand, without extremes of temperature in winter and summer. They reportedly grow well in Southern California and warmer parts of Great Britain. A number of cultivars have been developed, mostly of Pseudopanax lessonii. These include 'Gold Splash', which has yellow variegated leaves, and 'Nigra' which has dark purple-brown foliage. A National Trust listed specimen of Pseudopanax crassifolius exists on the Alton property at Mount Macedon, Victoria, Australia, which is 21 metres high and has an 11.5 m spread. Its age is estimated at 100 years. Host plant In New Zealand various species in this genus have been shown to be the host plant for the larvae of Scolopterus penicillatus, a common endemic weevil. The larvae develop in recently dead bark. References * C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N.

History The original lineup consisting of Kody Templeman, Zack Rawhauser, Cory Laurence, and Tim (Timmy V) O'Hara as a four-piece only recorded the first 7\\",\\"I Lost My Marbles\\", produced by Joe King of The Queers for his More Bounce to the Ounce compilation CD. The band continued as a three-piece after Zack quit. Their first full-length album, titled Shit Out of Luck, was released on Clearview Records in 1996. Following the release of their first album the band changed their lyrical focus. In 1999 they went into the studio with producer-engineer Mass Giorgini to record a new LP. This was done with the band's own money, and without the benefit of a record label. The result was Death by Television, released on March 30, 1999, an album that took sci-fi movie-themed songs such as \\"War Of The Worlds\\" and \\"Invasion Of The Saucermen\\" and combined them with tracks that made references to other retro themes, such as \\"X-Ray Specs.\\" The recordings instantly created a buzz. Successful label Fat Wreck Chords offered to release the album, but the band had already accepted an offer. They signed with Panic Button Records, an imprint of influential punk label Lookout! Records that was overseen by Ben Weasel of Screeching Weasel fame. The band spent the next two years touring heavily within the punk scene and disbanded after teaming with Giorgini for their final Panic Button/Lookout! release, the spy-themed LP The Backchannel Broadcast, which was released in February, 2001. The album included the song \\"Wait It Out\\", written by Ben Weasel and later re- recorded by The Riverdales for their record Phase Three. John Jughead (of Screeching Weasel and Even in Blackouts) filled in as second guitar on many tour stops on the Death by Television and Backchannel tours. Other notable appearances on these tours include Ben Weasel (at The Fireside in Chicago, his first stage appearance since 1995), and Lurch Nobody. Timmy V left the band after Death by Television and was replaced by Austin, Texas drummer Scott Holubec. Red Scare Industries reissued Death by Television and Backchannel Broadcast in 2005. The band split for a few years before reuniting with all original members to release a new album, The Too Late Show in 2006 with no plans on reuniting for a tour to support due to the members' other commitments. Templeman is currently a member of Laramie, Wyoming Punk rock band Teenage Bottlerocket. Drummer Timmy V was the touring drummer with Albuquerque, New Mexico all girl three-piece The Eyeliners, and plays drums in his own project Stabbed in Back, a punk rock band that is influenced by early DC bands. The band reformed in 2013 to play Riot Fest, and played a few shows in the Northeast in 2014. In November 2015, the group supported The Queers for a couple of shows. In early January 2017, it was announced that the band was in the studio recording a new album. On April 13, it was announced that an EP, titled Project 313, would be released via Red Scare Industries on June 9. On June 20, the band announced their new album was finished and would be released via Fat Wreck Chords in 2017.

A European example is its policy for \\"integration of non- European nationals\\", which finances and promotes integration initiatives targeting those who are not members of the European Union. This project aims to encourage dialogue in civil society, develop integration models, and spread and highlight the best initiatives regarding integration. The salad bowl idea in practice has its supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that being \\"American\\" does not inherently tie a person to a single culture, though rather to citizenship and loyalty to the United States. Thus, one does not need to abandon their cultural heritage in order to be considered \\"American\\".

He was assisted by Luigi Scalera, a young architecture graduate working for the London Docklands Development Corporation, who identified and made available the derelict building for the exhibition together with modest funding for painting the interior. Hirst and his collaborators intentionally imitated the look of Charles Saatchi's first gallery in St John's Wood that had opened a few years earlier. Saatchi, an art collector, attended Freeze and purchased a piece of art by Mat Collishaw. Michael Craig-Martin, a tutor at Goldsmiths Art College, used his influence in the London art world to convince Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota to visit the exhibition.

It was there that the work of the Young British Artists caught the attention of the collector Charles Saatchi. The catalogue for Freeze had surprisingly high production values for a student exhibition. It was designed by Tony Arefin and included an essay by art critic Ian Jeffrey. The catalogue was funded by the property developers Olympia and York. The title of the show came from the catalogue's description of Mat Collishaw's macro photograph Bullet Hole which showed a gunshot wound to a human head (taken from a pathology textbook). In 2007, Michael Craig-Martin said in an interview with Brian Sherwin: :I had always tried to help my students in any way I could, particularly in those first years after art school. I knew from personal experience how difficult it was‚ÄîI never had things come easy. I did the same with Damien and Freeze. I encouraged people to go and see the work. I would never have done this if I hadn't believed the show was of exceptional interest‚Äîwhy waste people's time?

References ","title":"1976 in rail transport"},{"id":"1260011","text":"The Idiot is the debut solo album by American musician Iggy Pop, released on March 18, 1977 by RCA Records. It was the first of two albums that Pop wrote and recorded in collaboration with David Bowie, who is credited as producer. The sessions for the album began before the recording of Bowie's 1977 album Low; as a result, The Idiot has been called the unofficial beginning of Bowie's Berlin period. Described by Pop as \\"a cross between James Brown and Kraftwerk,\\" The Idiot marked a departure from the guitar-based proto-punk of his former band the Stooges, and has been compared with Bowie's \\"Berlin Trilogy\\" of albums in its electronic sounds and introspective atmosphere. Its title was taken from Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel of the same title, three of the participants in the recording ‚Äî Bowie, Pop, and Tony Visconti ‚Äî being familiar with the book. The Idiot received critical acclaim upon its release, and is regarded by many as one of Pop's best works; however, it is not generally considered representative of his output. It was accompanied by the singles \\"Sister Midnight\\" and \\"China Girl,\\" Bowie issuing his own version of the latter as a single in 1983. The album has been characterized as a major influence on subsequent post-punk, industrial, and gothic artists. Production The album's opening track, \\"Sister Midnight\\", was written by Bowie, Pop and guitarist Carlos Alomar, and performed live on the Station to Station tour in early 1976. In July that year, following the end of the tour, Bowie and Pop holed up in Ch√¢teau d'H√©rouville, the same locale where Bowie recorded Pin Ups (1973) and would soon record much of Low, and began putting together the rest of the songs that later became The Idiot. At the Ch√¢teau they were augmented by Laurent Thibault on bass and Michel Santangeli on drums, who were required, with minimal guidance, to add to rough music tracks already taped by Bowie, their first takes often becoming part of the final mix. Recording continued in August at Musicland in Munich, Germany with guitarist Phil Palmer, who found the creative collaboration with Pop and Bowie stimulating but disquieting, never seeing them around during the day (\\"Vampiric would be the perfect word\\", he said later). Overdubs by Bowie's regular rhythm section of Carlos Alomar, Dennis Davis and George Murray, plus a final mix by Tony Visconti, took place in Berlin at Hansa Studio 1 (not, as is often incorrectly reported, the bigger Studio 2 by the Berlin Wall). Given the almost demo quality of the tapes, the post-production work was, in Visconti's words, \\"more of a salvage job than a creative mixing\\". Because of its ambiguous and in some cases non-existent credits, misconceptions have arisen over the years as to who contributed what to the album. Although the common belief that Pop wrote the lyrics while Bowie composed the music is generally accurate, their approach occasionally saw the positions change, with some music (such as \\"Dum Dum Boys\\") being Pop's and some lyrics (including the first verse to \\"Sister Midnight\\") being Bowie's. The album's cover photo ‚Äì which is a flopped image ‚Äì was inspired by Erich Heckel's painting Roquairol. It is often assumed to be by Bowie but was in fact taken by Andy Kent. No instrumental credits were included on the sleeve, causing some speculation as to the musicians involved; however, recent works by Hugo Wilcken, Paul Trynka and Nicholas Pegg have provided a generally agreed list of the personnel involved.  Style and themes  At the time of its release, Pop described The Idiot as a cross between James Brown and Kraftwerk. Bowie biographer David Buckley has called it \\"a funky, robotic Hellhole of an album\\". The funk influence was most pronounced on \\"Sister Midnight\\", based on a riff by Carlos Alomar and laced with Pop's oedipal dream imagery. Its lack of overtly electronic instrumentation belied what critic Dave Thompson has described as a \\"defiantly futuristic ambience\\". Pop, speaking of Bowie, described the Krautrock-influenced \\"Nightclubbing\\" as \\"my comment on what it was like hanging out with him every night\\". The track was recorded one night after the other musicians had left, Bowie playing the melody on piano with an old rhythm machine for backing. When Pop pronounced himself happy with the result, Bowie protested that they needed real drums to finish it off. Pop insisted on keeping the rhythm machine, saying \\"it kicks ass, it's better than a drummer\\". Pop largely wrote the lyrics on the spot \\"in ten minutes\\", Bowie suggesting that he write about \\"walking through the night like ghosts\\". The riff has been described as a mischievous quote of Gary Glitter's \\"Rock and Roll\\". \\"China Girl\\", originally called \\"Borderline\\", was a tale of unrequited love inspired by Kuelan Nguyen, partner of French actor-singer Jacques Higelin, who was also recording at Ch√¢teau d'H√©rouville at the time. The protagonist's \\"Shhh...\\" was a direct quote from Nguyen after Pop confessed his feelings for her one night. Production-wise it was raw and unpolished compared to Bowie's hit remake in 1983. Other songs included \\"Funtime\\", a proto-gothic number that Bowie advised Pop to sing \\"like Mae West\\"; \\"Dum Dum Boys\\", a tribute/lament for Pop's former Stooges bandmates (the spoken intro references Zeke Zettner, Dave Alexander, Scott Asheton and James Williamson) and \\"Mass Production\\", a harsh, grinding piece of early industrial electronica.  Release  = Original edition = Although the bulk of The Idiot was recorded before Low, the initial installment of the \\"Berlin Trilogy\\", Bowie's album was released first in January 1977, while Pop's was held over until March. Laurent Thibault opined that \\"David didn't want people to think he'd been inspired by Iggy's album, when in fact it was all the same thing\\". In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray suggested that The Idiot's electronic sound had been \\"pioneered\\" on Low, whereas by 2000, Nicholas Pegg would describe it as \\"a stepping stone between Station to Station and Low. The Idiot peaked at number 72 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart, and also reached number 30 on the UK Albums Chart, marking the first time an Iggy Pop album had cracked the top 40. \\"Sister Midnight\\" and \\"China Girl\\" were released as singles in February and May 1977, respectively, both with the same B-side \\"Baby\\". =2020 deluxe edition= On April 10, 2020, Pop released an alternate mix of \\"China Girl\\" in promotion of the forthcoming release of The Bowie Years, a seven-disc deluxe box set featuring expanded remastered versions of The Idiot and Pop's second Bowie-produced album, Lust for Life. The box set, released on May 29, includes remastered versions of both albums along with outtakes, alternate mixes and a 40-page booklet. The two original albums were also re-released individually, each paired with an additional album of live material to create separate stand-alone two-disc deluxe editions.  Critical reception  Biographer Paul Trynka wrote that The Idiot \\"would remain an album that was more respected than loved, the reviews mostly neutral\\", but that it \\"prefigured the soul of post-punk\\". In a contemporary review of the album, Rolling Stone termed it \\"the most savage indictment of rock posturing ever recorded\\" and \\"a necrophiliac's delight\\".  Legacy  While the album has become highly praised in its own right over the years, fans of Iggy Pop have criticized the work as unrepresentative of his repertoire and as evidence of his being \\"co- opted\\" by Bowie for the latter's own ends. Bowie himself later admitted: Bowie later re-worked \\"Sister Midnight\\" with new lyrics as \\"Red Money\\" on his 1979 album Lodger, while his version of \\"China Girl\\" on 1983's Let's Dance became a major hit. Pop has called The Idiot his \\"album of freedom\\". Siouxsie Sioux described it as \\"re-affirmation that our suspicions were true ‚Äì the man was a genius and what a voice!\\" and she performed \\"Nightclubbing\\" with her second band the Creatures at the Glastonbury festival in 1999.\\"Siouxsie / The Creatures Glastonbury\\" . Youtube. Retrieved November 2, 2019. The album has been cited as a major influence on a number of acts, including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, and Joy Division ‚Äì the lead singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, committed suicide in 1980 with the record still playing on his turntable. Killing Joke's Youth also described The Idiot as one of his favorite albums. In 1981, Grace Jones covered the song \\"Nightclubbing\\" as the title track to her album of the same name. Pop's version of \\"Nightclubbing\\" provided the kick drum sound for Nine Inch Nails' 1994 song \\"Closer\\". The drum loop of \\"Nightclubbing\\" was also duplicated by Oasis for the song \\"Force of Nature\\" on their 2002 album Heathen Chemistry. \\"Nightclubbing\\" was also sampled in the song \\"Small Town Witch\\" by the British band Sneaker Pimps on their 2002 album Bloodsport.  Live performances  \\"Nightclubbing\\" and \\"Funtime\\" appeared on the 1978 live set TV Eye, recorded during Pop's 1977 tour, the UK and portions of the US leg of which featured Bowie on keyboards and backing vocals. Most of the album was performed alongside Lust for Life material during the 2016 spring tour by Pop and his new band featuring Josh Homme, Dean Fertita and Troy Van Leeuwen from Queens of the Stone Age and Matt Helders from Arctic Monkeys, as part of the promotion for Post Pop Depression, an album self-referential to Pop's Berlin period.

Publication history =Hero For Hire/Power Man= The series debuted as Hero For Hire #1, and became Power Man from #17 onwards. The cover logo included Luke Cage's name, so from #1‚Äì16 the cover logo read Luke Cage, Hero For Hire and from #17 onwards Luke Cage, Power Man. The series was initially written by Luke Cage's co-creator Archie Goodwin, pencilled by George Tuska, and inked by Billy Graham. =Power Man and Iron Fist= Eventually, Power Man's sales became unsustainable. Marvel decided to combine his series with Iron Fist, another once popular superhero who could no longer support his own series, in order to save both characters from full cancellation. Iron Fist joined the cast of Power Man in a three part story arc in #48‚Äì50. The series title changed to Power Man and Iron Fist with #50, though the indicia did not reflect this change until #67. Iron Fist writer Chris Claremont penned the initial stories pairing the characters, but was soon forced to turn the series over to Jo Duffy due to his unmanageable workload. Duffy's run was noted for its lighthearted, humorous, character-driven tone, and had relatively few fight scenes. A young Kurt Busiek had his first regular assignment with the title, writing it from issue #90 to #100. He emulated the lighthearted humor of Duffy's run, not knowing that Duffy had been taken off Power Man and Iron Fist precisely because the editorial staff disapproved of her lighthearted tongue- in-cheek approach to the series. Goodwin then returned to the series, but had difficulty keeping up with the work, and his brief second run was littered with issues by fill-in writers, including two by Busiek. Jim Owsley, another Marvel staffer, took over as regular writer. The series concluded with the death of Iron Fist in #125, a controversial story. Owsley later commented, \\"Fist‚Äôs death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers‚Äô heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist‚Äôs death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book.\\" =Heroes For Hire= In 1996, Marvel launched a new Heroes For Hire, written by John Ostrander and illustrated by Pasqual Ferry, featuring Luke Cage and Iron Fist along with many other characters. It lasted for 19 issues. A new Heroes for Hire series was developed in 2006 as a spin-off of the Daughters of the Dragon limited series. The team line-up did not include Luke Cage or Danny Rand. =Power Man and Iron Fist revival= Power Man and Iron Fist returned as a five-issue limited series in 2011, spinning-off from the \\"Shadowland\\" storyline, which introduced a new Power Man, Victor Alvarez. It was written by one of the character's creators Fred Van Lente, with art by Wellinton Alves. =Reprints= Four Marvel Essential trade paperbacks were published reprinting issues of the first Power Man and Iron Fist series. Essential Luke Cage, Power Man Volume 2, features Power Man #48-49, Essential Iron Fist Volume 1 features Power Man #48-49 and Power Man and Iron Fist #50.

It was built between 1833 and the 1860s to neoclassical designs of Giorgio Grognet de Vass√©, on the site of an earlier Renaissance church which had been built in around 1614 to designs of Tommaso Dingli. The design of the present church is based on the Pantheon in Rome, has the third largest unsupported dome in the world and is Malta's largest and most famous church. The church narrowly avoided destruction during World War II when on 9 April 1942 a German aerial bomb pierced the dome and fell into the church during Mass, but failed to explode. This event was interpreted by the some Maltese as a miracle, although many bombs failed to explode. History Although Pietro Dusina recorded Mosta as a parish in his 1575 pastoral visit, the town actually became a parish in 1608. Plans to construct a new church began soon afterwards, and the church was built in around 1614 to designs attributed to the Renaissance architect Tommaso Dingli. This church was commonly called Ta' Ziri. By the 1830s, this church had become too small to cater for the town's population. Giorgio Grognet de Vass√© proposed rebuilding the church on a neoclassical design based on the Pantheon in Rome. Despite opposition from Bishop Francesco Saverio Caruana, the design was approved and construction of the church began on 30 May 1833. Replica of the bomb which pierced the dome on 9 April 1942 The new church was built around the old church, which remained in use throughout the course of construction. The residents of Mosta helped in building the church, taking part in construction work on Sundays and public holidays. Since Grognet had never received any formal architectural training, he received consultation services from an architect of the Sammut family. The rotunda took 28 years to build, being completed in the early 1860s. The old church was demolished in 1860, and the new church did not need to be consecrated since the site had remained a place of worship throughout the course of construction. The church was officially dedicated on 15 October 1871. During World War II, the town of Mosta was prone to aerial bombardment due to its proximity to the airfield of RAF Ta Kali. At about 16:40 on 9 April 1942, the Luftwaffe dropped three bombs on the church, and two of them deflected without exploding. However, one 500 kg high explosive bomb pierced the dome and entered the church, where a congregation of more than 300 people was awaiting early evening mass. The bomb did not explode, and a Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal unit defused it and dumped it into the sea off the west coast of Malta. This event was interpreted as a miracle by the inhabitants, and a similar bomb is now displayed in the sacristy at the back of the church, under the words Il-Miraklu tal-Bomba, 9 ta' April 1942 (meaning \\"The Bomb Miracle, 9 April 1942\\"). On the 12 December 1973 Pope Paul VI, issued a decree of canonical coronation of the titular painting of Our Lady of the Assumption and therefore elevating the church to the title of Marian Sanctuary. In 2015, the parish requested to the Vatican to be reclassified to the status of a basilica. The church was elevated to a minor basilica on 29 July 2018 by decree of Pope Francis. https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/52394/1/Mosta_Rotunda_elevated_to_the_dignity_of_minor_basilica.PDF Architecture Late 19th century photograph of the Pantheon in Rome, which inspired the design of the Rotunda of Mosta The Rotunda of Mosta is built in the neoclassical style, and its structure is based on the Pantheon in Rome. Its fa√ßade has a portico with six Ionic columns, which is flanked by two bell towers. Being a rotunda, the church has a circular plan with walls about thick supporting a dome with an internal diameter of . At one time, the dome was the third largest in the world. The church's interior contains eight niches, including a bay containing the main entrance and a deep apse with the main altar. Before the church was constructed, there was some opposition to Grognet's design, since some regarded a Roman temple as an unsuitable model for a Catholic church building. However, others praised the design, and an 1839 book written while the church was being built describes it as \\"certainly the most magnificent, extensive and solid modern building\\" in Malta. This book further states that \\"when finished, [the church] will be an ornament to the Island, will immortalize the architect, and draw towards the casal every visitor to Malta.\\" The design was well-received upon completion, and it is regarded as Grognet's masterpiece.

His father was a lieutenant colonel in the Austro-Hungarian army, and was frequently transferred to different countries in Eastern Europe; the family moved with him. Pokorny was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army and served from March 1915 to September 1918 in the First World War. He completed his medical doctorate on 22 March 1922 and received his medical license. After two years of clinical training, he opened a practice in Komotau. His application to join the Nazi party was declined in 1939, because he had been married to a Jewish physician, Dr. Lilly Weil, with whom he had two children and from whom he had been divorced in April 1935. During World War II, Pokorny worked as a medical officer of the German Armed Forces. Pokorny wrote to Heinrich Himmler to suggest sterilization of Russian prisoners of war utilizing the sap of the caladium plant, which, according to an article in a medical journal, was thought to cause sterilization in mice. The method was not implemented due to technical obstacles. Pokorny was tried by the American Military Tribunal No. I (also known as the Doctors' Trial) in August 1947. Despite the letter, he was found to have had no direct involvement in compulsory sterilization experiments, and was acquitted.

It is located west-southwest of Novato, at an elevation of 194 feet (59 m). The Nicasio region is a hydrologic zone containing the four main drainages of Nicasio Creek up to the ridgelines defining their basin. This includes: the south fork of Nicasio Creek extending from Moon Hill, along the ridge separating Nicasio from San Geronimo and Samuel P. Taylor State Park, and extending northwest towards the northern end of Platform Bridge Road; the east fork (Lucas Valley fork) of Nicasio Creek extending from Loma Alta and the ridge on the north side of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, extending up through Big Rock and up towards Big-Rock Ridge; the Halleck Creek drainage, up to the ridges separating Nicasio from Novato; the northern drainages extending along the ridgelines of Rocky Ridge, Hicks Mountain and Black Mountain. A major landmark in the area is the man-made Nicasio Reservoir. Nicasio is scenically very attractive with forested and open ridgelines surrounding a wide rolling valley. The area along Lucas Valley Road follows a narrow valley with mostly forested hillsides above it. Oak, bay, and fir trees are common in the area, and along some of the creeks stands of redwoods are still found. Wildlife is abundant; the Nicasio chickadee, a subspecies of the chestnut-backed chickadee, was named by Robert Ridgway. Three main roads cross the area: Lucas Valley Road, Nicasio Valley Road, and the Point Reyes-Petaluma Road. Important pieces of public land in the surrounding area include Point Reyes National Seashore, portions of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and Samuel P. Taylor State Park. Within the Nicasio area are about 250 homes located on approximately 350 parcels. Much of the land is still used for agricultural purposes including beef and dairy cattle grazing, small-scale truck farming (including organic farming), and the raising of forage. Several small vineyards have also been recently established. Next to Rancho Nicasio within the town of Nicasio is an organic farm, AllStar Organics, owned and operated by Janet Brown and Marty Jacobson; Janet is the vice-president of Marin Organic, Marin County's non-profit organic association. Just north of Nicasio Reservoir is Fairlea Ranch, , where pedigree longhorn cattle are raised. The most significant non-agricultural business within Nicasio is George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch, a part of Lucasfilm Ltd. Population estimates for the area range from about 600 to about 900 people. According to a 2004 Forbes magazine real estate survey, Nicasio is the 23rd most expensive zip code in the US. Centrally located in this area is the small village of Nicasio itself. The village is in 415/628. The town center has a post office (zip code 94946), a general store, a tiny real estate office, St. Mary's Church (established in 1867), Nicasio Volunteer Fire Department, a baseball field located in the town square, Rancho Nicasio, which is a bar/restaurant/live music establishment, a Druid's Hall, as well as a number of private homes. The town was founded in the early 19th century to support local agricultural, timber, and fishing activities. The town once contained the twenty-two-room Hotel Nicasio, which opened in 1867 but burned down in December 1940. Just north of town on Nicasio Valley Road is a beautiful red-painted one-room schoolhouse that opened in 1871. The building is currently a listed historical landmark. The Nicasio post office opened in 1871, closed in 1899, and re-opened in 1900. In 2008 Dewey Livingston wrote a detailed history of the region, Nicasio: The Historic Valley at the Center of Marin.

The service was uplinked to satellite from Syracuse, New York by Eastern Microwave, Inc., which later sold the satellite distribution rights to the Advance Entertainment Corporation subsidiary of Advance Publications, a Syracuse-based company that also owned various print, broadcast, and cable television properties. In the New York metropolitan area, the superstation feed was not available on local cable providers, but was available to satellite subscribers. Two exceptions to this took place, once on February 26, 1993 after the World Trade Center bombing, when the local WWOR's transmitter was knocked out for the day. Cable providers in the New York metro area used the superstation feed as a substitute until the transmitter returned to service. The other was on Long Beach Island in Ocean County, New Jersey. Although that area falls within the New York City market, the Comcast system serving that area carried WWOR EMI Service instead of the local feed, as they were unable to obtain a microwave link to be able to carry channel 9. Months after the end of the feed, that system began carrying the local feed, which by that point was uplinked to satellite. History =1965 to January 1990= In 1965, Eastern Microwave began relaying the signal of WOR-TV (channel 9) in New York City via microwave to cable providers located in markets immediately surrounding the New York City metropolitan area, reaching as far west as Buffalo, New York and as far south as Delaware, as well as throughout New England. In April 1979, Eastern began to uplink the signal for satellite and cable subscribers throughout the United States, joining WGN-TV in Chicago and WTBS (now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta as a national superstation. For the eleven years that followed, cable viewers throughout the United States saw the same exact signal that the New York City market saw. =Arrival of SyndEx= In 1989, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed the \\"Syndication Exclusivity Rights rule\\" (or \\"SyndEx\\") into law. This law meant that whenever a local television station had the exclusive rights to broadcast a syndicated program, that particular program must be blacked out on any out-of-market stations that were carried by local cable providers. After the law was passed, EMI purchased the rights to programs that no stations had claimed exclusive rights to, and launched a special national feed for cable and satellite subscribers outside of the New York City market on January 1, 1990, called the \\"WWOR EMI Service\\". Most of the syndicated programs that WWOR-TV had the rights to show in the New York City market were covered up by the alternate programming shown on the national feed‚Äîwith the exception of sporting events, local newscasts and other WWOR-produced programming such as Steampipe Alley, The Joe Franklin Show, the overnight Shop at Home program, the annual Weekend with the Stars Telethon for United Cerebral Palsy, the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and a select number of programs that were not claimed as exclusive to any market. Most of the programs came from the libraries of Universal Television (whose parent company, MCA Inc., owned WWOR- TV at the time of the EMI Service's founding), MGM Television and Quinn Martin, along with some shows from the Christian Science Monitors television service, as well as some holdover shows that had aired on the local New York feed before the SyndEx law's passage. This caused confusion among WWOR's cable viewers outside of the New York metropolitan area, as promotions during time periods in which the national feed was simulcasting WWOR's New York signal were left unaltered, leaving in promos for shows that were not airing on the national feed due to the SyndEx law. When channel 9 became a UPN affiliate in 1995, the WWOR EMI Service also covered up the network's shows, due to Paramount (although the network's sole owner-turned-half owner Chris-Craft owned the station) using syndication exclusivity to keep UPN's shows off the national WWOR feed‚Äîin contrast, rival superstation WGN carried programming from The WB Television Network on its national feed until nationwide terrestrial coverage was deemed sufficient to discontinue its carriage over the national WGN feed in October 1999. As a result of the syndication exclusivity claims by UPN, if New York City viewers of WWOR saw Star Trek: Voyager, cable viewers throughout the rest of the country saw Hazel reruns in the same timeslot. In mid-1996, EMI sold the satellite distribution rights to WWOR and Boston's WSBK-TV to Advance Entertainment Corporation. On January 1, 1997, AEC discontinued the feed,McConville, Jim. \\"N.Y.'s WWOR loses super status; satellite distributor discontinues service contract with television station\\", Broadcasting & Cable, January 6, 1997.

Retrieved February 24, 2011 from HighBeam Research. which Advance still presently owns in part. =Reversion to New York feed= Due to outcry from satellite dish owners who missed WWOR, the station was uplinked to satellite once again on a different transponder by National Programming Service, LLC less than a week after AEC's discontinuation of the WWOR national feed. The national feed was once again the same feed that New York City area viewers saw, with all of the syndicated and UPN programs intact, due to the station now only being distributed outside of New York to satellite dish owners.

Life and career Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Gotlieb studied at United College (now the University of Winnipeg) for two years before transferring to the University of California at Berkeley where he received his BA. He received his MA from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and his LL.B degree from Harvard University, where he was editor of the Harvard Law Review. In 1957, he joined the Department of External Affairs. From 1960 to 1964, he served on Canada's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva and at the Conference on Disarmament. In 1965, he wrote the book Disarmament and International Law, a book discussing disarmament during Cold War tensions. From 1967 to 1968 he was assistant undersecretary and led the legal division at External Affairs. From 1968 to 1973, Gotlieb was deputy minister of the Department of Communications, and from 1973 to 1976 deputy minister of Manpower and Immigration. From 1977 to 1981 he was assistant undersecretary at External Affairs. Most notably, Gotlieb was Canadian ambassador to the United States from 1981 to 1989. During his high-profile years in Washington, D.C., he got to know then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Vice-President George H. W. Bush, and many senior officials in the Reagan White House, such as Caspar Weinberger, Michael Deaver, James Baker III, and George P. Shultz. An advocate of realism in international relations, Gotlieb became known as a skillful and respected player in the complex world of Washington power politics. He and his wife Sondra Gotlieb were known for their dazzling parties attended by powerful figures in Washington. Sondra's book Washington Rollercoaster recounted the Gotliebs' high-powered years as glamorous hosts in Washington, when she also wrote a column for The Washington Post. Sondra attracted a blaze of international publicity on March 19, 1986, when she slapped her social secretary at an official dinner she and her husband were hosting in honour of the Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and U.S. Vice-President George H. W. Bush. After he and Sondra returned to Canada in the early 1990s, they moved to Toronto and became the centre of establishment society in that city. Sondra began writing newspaper columns for The Globe and Mail and the National Post. After his return to Canada, Allan Gotlieb became an influential figure and was well-connected in both the Canadian and American corporate elites. This marked a shift from his earlier career as a senior mandarin in Ottawa, where he had been a powerful figure and architect of many of Liberal prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's interventionist policies. From 1989 to 1994, Gotlieb was chairman of the Canada Council. He was also publisher of Saturday Night magazine when it was owned by Conrad Black, and a senior counsel at the law firm, Stikeman Elliott. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1982 and was promoted to Companion in 1987. In 1992, Gotlieb was the Canadian representative on the arbitration panel that decided the Canada‚ÄìFrance Maritime Boundary Case; Gotlieb dissented from the panel's decision in the case and wrote a dissent. Gotlieb was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Toronto in 2002 and by Concordia University in 2005. Gotlieb was an honorary and former fellow of Wadham College, Oxford and was a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. Hollinger Inc. was among his numerous corporate directorships. He was a member of the Carlyle Group's Canadian advisory board and a member of the Trilateral Commission. He was also chairman of Sotheby's Canada, former chairman of the Ontario Heritage Foundation, and served as chairman of the board of governors of the Donner Canadian Foundation, known for its annual literary prize. He was also a senior advisor in the law office of Bennett Jones. Gotlieb was a prodigious art collector, notably of the work of 19th-century painter James Tissot. He and his wife donated their Tissot collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario. Gotlieb also collected wall tiles by the famous English tile manufacturer and designer William de Morgan a close friend of William Morris with whom he collaborated on numerous occasions. De Morgan is famous for his lusterware tiles created by a process he rediscovered after it had been lost since the Middle Ages. Allan Gotlieb has some 150 De Morgan tiles including some of the best examples of the lusterware tiles and multiple tile compositions comprising pictorial designs. The Gotlieb collection is a major collection of the work of one of the most talented Victorian artists. He was a strong proponent of a North American Union between Canada, the US and Mexico authoring a new article titled \\"Why not a grand bargain with the U.S.?\\" which popularized the phrase \\"Grand Bargain\\". When Ronald Reagan died in 2004, Gotlieb provided commentary for CBC Newsworld's coverage of the state funeral drawing from his experiences as Canadian ambassador to Washington when Reagan was president. On the art of diplomacy in Washington, he said in 2009, \\"You have to get the power shakers, including the media, into your dining room. When an ambassador makes a phone call to a powerful congressman, he'll return the call once, but after that you have to make a personal relationship.\\" Gotlieb published his diplomatic memoirs, The Washington Diaries, in 2006. Personal life  He married Sondra Gotlieb (n√©e Kaufman) in December 1955. Gotlieb died on April 18, 2020 from cancer and Parkinson's disease at his home in Toronto. The Gotliebs had three children, one of whom predeceased him in 2003. Honours Gottlieb was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada and received his insignia from Governor- General Jeanne Sauve in Ottawa on May 6, 1988. In 2014, he was made a member of the Order of Manitoba.

He led the 1950 French Annapurna expedition that first climbed a peak over 8000m, Annapurna, in 1950, and reached the summit with Louis Lachenal. Upon his return, he wrote a best-selling book about the expedition. Ascent of Annapurna I: a historic exploit On 3 June 1950, Herzog and Louis Lachenal became the first climbers in modern history to climb a peak over 8000m when, on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition, they summited the Himalayan mountain Annapurna I, the 10th-highest mountain in the world. The ascent was all the more remarkable because the peak was explored, reconnoitered and climbed all within one season; and was climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen. It is also the only 8000 meter summit that was reached at the first attempt. Herzog was awarded the 1950 Gold Medal of the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie. The event caused a huge sensation that was only matched when Everest was summited in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. The two-week retreat from the peak proved very challenging. Both climbers had opted for light boots for the summit dash. This, combined with Herzog losing his gloves near the summit and a night spent bivouacked in a crevasse on the descent with one sleeping bag for four climbers (Lachenal, Gaston R√©buffat, Lionel Terray, and Herzog) resulted in severe frostbite, with consequent gangrene requiring the expedition doctor to perform emergency amputations in the field. Both summit climbers lost all of their toes and Herzog most of his fingers. Annapurna was not climbed again until 1970, when the French north face route was climbed by a British Army expedition, simultaneously with an ascent of the south face by an expedition led by British climber Chris Bonington. The mountain's fourth ascent was not until 1977. Book Herzog's account of the expedition was published first in 1951 in French, then in English in 1952 under the title Annapurna. The book has sold over 11 million copies as of 2000, more than any other mountaineering title. Ending with the stirring line \\"there are other Annapurnas in the lives of men\\" (in the context of the book, an exhortation to answer the challenges that life offers), the book gave an account of the expedition that established Herzog's climbing reputation and inspired a generation of mountaineers.  Controversy over his account of the ascent  Some aspects of Herzog's account of the summit day have been called into question with the publication of other members‚Äô accounts of the expedition, most significantly by a biography of Gaston R√©buffat and the posthumous publication, in 1996, of Lachenal's contemporaneous journals. The 2000 book True Summit: What Really Happened on the Legendary Ascent of Annapurna by David Roberts gives one view of the controversy.  Other achievements  Herzog went on to become the French Minister of Youth and Sport from 1958 to 1963, and mayor of the alpine town of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc. He was a member of the International Olympic Committee for 25 years from 1970, and has an honorary member after 1995. He was a Grand Officer of the Legion d'Honneur and holder of the Croix de Guerre for military service 1939‚Äì45. Herzog was a 1944 graduate of the French business school HEC Paris.

CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 23, 2012 The term was coined by British scientist J.B.S. Haldane in 1924. Human embryos and fetuses Ectogenesis of human embryos and fetuses would require an artificial uterus. An artificial uterus would have to be supplied by nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the placenta. An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to avail the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human reproductive rights. Ectogenesis could also be a means by which homosexual and single men could have genetic offspring without the use of surrogate pregnancy or a sperm donor, and allow women to have children without going through the pregnancy cycle. Bioethical considerations The development of artificial uteri and ectogenesis raises a few bioethical and legal considerations, and also has important implications for reproductive rights and the abortion debate. Artificial uteri may expand the range of fetal viability, raising questions about the role that fetal viability plays within abortion law. Within severance theory, for example, abortion rights only include the right to remove the fetus, and do not always extend to the termination of the fetus. If transferring the fetus from a woman's womb to an artificial uterus is possible, the choice to terminate a pregnancy in this way could provide an alternative to aborting the fetus. There are also theoretical concerns that children who develop in an artificial uterus may lack \\"some essential bond with their mothers that other children have\\"; a secondary issue to woman's rights over their own body. In the 1970 book The Dialectic of Sex, feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of gender inequality. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an artificial womb would free \\"women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology.\\" See also * Ectopic pregnancy * Endometrium * IVF * Placenta * Uterus * Amniotic fluid * Apheresis * ECMO * Hemodialysis * Liver dialysis * TPN * Tissue engineering References Further reading Category:Developmental biology ","title":"Ectogenesis"},{"id":"1260056","text":"Events = March events = * March ‚Äì With French government support, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans absorbs the Compagnie du Centre; the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Tours √† Nantes; and the Compagnie du chemin de fer d'Orl√©ans √† Bordeaux. = June events = * June 17 ‚Äì The Somerset Central Railway in England is authorized. =July events= * July 14 ‚Äì Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Chepstow Bridge is opened to traffic, completing the South Wales Railway throughout from Gloucester (England) to Swansea. =October events= * October 1 ‚Äì The Great Western Railway's Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway in England is completed throughout from Banbury to Birmingham Snow Hill as a dual gauge line. * October 10 ‚Äì The first revenue trains operate over the Chicago & Rock Island Railroad, an early predecessor of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, between Chicago and Joliet, Illinois.

The awards were founded in 1984 to replace the less-lavish Soapy Award; those awards shows had run since 1977. The Soap Opera Digest Awards are meant to promote excellence in the soap opera genre and are decided by the fans who read the magazine. The statue itself is currently made of crystal, and is in the shape of a heart. History The first Soap Opera Digest Award show aired in 1984, and was featured on national syndicated television and hosted by then husband and wife Catherine Hickland and David Hasselhoff. One of the reasons for the move up was the new-found audience of both Daytime and Prime time soap operas. That year for the first time awards were given to prime time soap operas as well as daytime soaps. This practice was phased out in the 1990s as primetime soap operas began to lose the large appeal they once had. For the first two years fans themselves voted on the nominees list as well as the winners. Ballot stuffing and a voting bloc for the 1985 awards led to the side effect where Days of Our Lives swept almost every category. The third awards were changed so that the editors of the magazine chose the nominees and each reader was allowed only one ballot to vote for their favorites. This allowed other shows such as Santa Barbara and Another World to take home trophies. A change in award season from the end of the year to the beginning meant that there was no show in 1987. In 1992 the awards were broadcast live for the first time; in addition, the award statue (previously a flat crystal heart) was redesigned to be an inch taller. NBC had aired the event ever since it made its way to network television, but the show would no longer be seen on the network after the airing of the 2000 awards. The year 2001 marked the first time that there was no awards ceremony and voting was done entirely online. In 2003 the cable channel SOAPnet broadcast the awards which were hosted by Lisa Rinna and Ty Treadway. No awards were given out in 2002 or 2004. The 2005 awards were done entirely through the magazine. Fans could find a ballot in a November issue of Soap Opera Digest and then mail it to the editors. Only one ballot per person was counted. The awards were announced in the magazine in February 2005.

Lawrence Goldman, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 257 His family then moved to Streatham, where Cowling attended an LCC elementary school, and from 1937 the Battersea Grammar School. When the Second World War started in 1939 the school moved to Worthing and then from 1940 to Hertford where Cowling attended sixth-form.Michael Bentley, 'Prologue: The retiring Mr Cowling‚Äô, in Bentley (ed.), Public and Private Doctrine. Essays in British History Presented to Maurice Cowling (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 3. In 1943 Cowling won a scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, but was called up for military service in September 1944, where he joined the Queen's Royal Regiment. In 1945, after training and serving in a holding battalion, he was sent to Bangalore as an officer cadet.Bentley, p. 3. In 1946 Cowling was attached to the Kumaon Regiment and the next year-and-a- half he travelled to Agra, Razmak on the North-West Frontier and Assam. As independence for India neared in 1947, Cowling was dispatched to Egypt as a camp adjutant to the British HQ there. Cowling was then promoted to captain in Libya. By the end of 1947 Cowling was finally demobilised, and in 1948 he went back to Jesus College to complete his History Tripos, where he received a Double First.Bentley, pp. 3‚Äì4. Cowling later remembered that he fell in love with Cambridge.Naim Attallah, Singular Encounters (London: Quartet Books, 1990), p. 129. He toyed with the idea of being ordained and went to college chapel, possessing \\"a strong polemical Christianity\\". Of his religion, Cowling later said: In 1954 Cowling worked at the British Foreign Office for six months at the Jordan department, and in early 1955, The Times gave him the job of foreign leader-writer, which he held for three years. In 1957 Cowling was invited by the Director of the Conservative Political Centre to write a pamphlet on the Suez Crisis; it was never published however, as the party wanted to move on from Suez as quickly as possible. He stood unsuccessfully for the parliamentary seat of Bassetlaw during the General Election of 1959 for the Conservative Party.Bentley, p. 5. Cowling later said that \\"I enjoyed being a candidate, though it was very hard work and elections are like what I imagine having all your teeth out is like\\".Attallah, p. 134.  Academic career  In 1961 Cowling was elected a Fellow of Jesus College and Director of Studies in Economics, shortly before the History Faculty appointed him to an Assistant Lectureship. Cowling's first book was The Nature and Limits of Political Science. Influenced by Michael Oakeshott, this was an attack on political science and political philosophy as it was then taught. Cowling argued that social science's claim to have discovered how people behaved was false because politics was too complex and fluid to be rationalised by theorists and only fully intelligible to politicians.Jonathan Parry, 'Cowling, Maurice John (1926‚Äì2005)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, online edn, May 2009, accessed 15 May 2010. During six weeks of the summer of 1962 Cowling wrote Mill and Liberalism, which was published in 1963 and became one of his most contentious books.Bentley, p. 6. The book argued Mill was not as libertarian as he was traditionally portrayed, and that Mill resembled a \\"moral totalitarian\\". Dr. Roland Hall reviewed the book in Philosophical Quarterly (January 1965) and called it \\"dangerous and unpleasant\\",Roland Hall, ‚ÄòReview: Mill and Liberalism by Maurice Cowling‚Äô, The Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15, No. 58 (Jan., 1965), p. 71. with Cowling later remarking that this \\"was what it was intended to be\\".Maurice Cowling, Mill and Liberalism. Second Edition (Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. xii. Peterhouse Old Court In 1963 he was elected a Fellow to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he advised his students to tackle liberals with \\"irony, geniality and malice\\". During the 1960s Cowling campaigned against a sociology course to be introduced at Cambridge, regarding it as a \\"vehicle for liberal dogma\\". In November 1966 Cowling was elected as a Conservative councillor on the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council in a by-election, which he held until 1970. He was appointed the literary editor of The Spectator from 1970 to 1971, and in the early 1970s he wrote articles of a broadly Powellite nature arguing against the UK being a member of the EEC. Cowling resigned in 1971 when the editor acting in George Gale's absence refused to publish Cowling's protest against his publication of an article by Tony Palmer which suggested that the important question about Princess Anne was whether she was a virgin. It was on Cowling's suggestion that Paul Smith edited a collection of Lord Salisbury's articles from the Quarterly Review, published in 1972.Paul Smith (ed.), Lord Salisbury on Politics. A Selection from His Articles in the Quarterly Review, 1860‚Äì83 (Cambridge University Press, 1972), p. vii. In 1977 Margaret Thatcher visited the Cambridge Graduate Conservative Association of Peterhouse where she \\"cut through the compact subtlety and 'rational pessimism' of [Cowling]\\" and sharply retorted: \\"We don't want pessimists in our party\\".Peter Ghosh, ‚ÄòTowards the verdict of history: Mr Cowling's Doctrine‚Äô, in Michael Bentley (ed.), Public and Private Doctrine. Essays in British history presented to Maurice Cowling (Cambridge University Press, 1993, ), p. 288. In 1978 he ceased to be Director of Studies in Peterhouse, and helped to found the Salisbury Group, a group of conservative thinkers named, on Michael Oakeshott's advice, after Lord Salisbury. In the same year Cowling published Conservative Essays where he said: Cowling was \\"instrumental\\" in getting the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Lord Dacre of Glanton, from Oxford to become Master of Peterhouse from 1980 to 1987, though in later years he came to regret supporting Dacre's arrival there. Cowling's reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at Trevor-Roper's urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as: > Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti- > clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did > not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of > General Franco‚Äôs death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and > Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled > to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (\\"a strong mind trapped in > its own glutinous frustrations\\"), and to bring the college back to a > condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side > won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of > the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman's 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the Economist wrote that picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\", stating the college had become under Cowling's influence a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\", who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms. In November 1989 Cowling published his essay on \\"The Sources of the New Right\\" in Encounter which detailed the ideological roots of Thatcherism in Britain and became the Preface to the second edition of Mill and Liberalism in 1990. In 1990 Cowling described himself as \\"an intellectual Thatcherite, just as I was an intellectual Powellite, and I think it is important that the Conservative party should be in good hands and that it should win elections...I am a warm supporter [of the Thatcher government]\\". In Cowling's view \\"Liberalism is essentially the belief that there can be a reconciliation of all difficulties and differences, and since there can't, it is a misleading way to approach politics\\".Attallah, p. 136. He regarded Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses as \\"a nasty, sneering, free-thinking book ... I can understand why the book is offensive and it didn't seem to me to be anything but offensive when I read it. Some thinking Moslems take a view of the nature of religion, and the incompatibility between Islam and liberalism, which runs parallel to what I'm saying in Mill and Liberalism\\".Attallah, p. 142. In 1992 Philip Williamson published his book on British politics from 1926 to 1932 and said Cowling \\"provided the original inspiration\\" for it.Philip Williamson, National Crisis and National Government. British Politics, the Economy and Empire. 1926‚Äì1932 (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. xiv.  Later life and death  Cowling retired from the History Faculty of Cambridge in 1988, and from his Fellowship of Peterhouse in 1993. He rarely returned to the university. In 1996, in Swansea, where he now lived, Cowling married George Gale's ex-wife Patricia, with whom he had long conducted an affair. On 24 August 2005, Cowling died at Singleton Hospital in Swansea after a long illness. The Politics of British Democracy Cowling wrote three books on British high politics, the sequence he called The Politics of British Democracy.Maurice Cowling, The Impact of Hitler. British Politics and British Policy. 1933‚Äì1940 (Cambridge University Press, 1975), p. ix. Cowling wrote that \\"In the future there will be an introduction bearing the sequence-title which will deal in its widest aspects with the period from 1850 to 1940 and will assess the methods used in the volumes which have now been published\\".Cowling, The Impact of Hitler, p. ix. However this never appeared. Cowling wrote a letter to The Times Literary Supplement on 3 June 1977 arguing for the need for \\"a different emphasis\\" to that on high politics. The first of these was his work on the Reform Act 1867, published during its centenary and dedicated to \\"the Prime Minister\\", Labour leader Harold Wilson. Cowling challenged the traditional liberal assumptions over the reform crisis of the 1860s by arguing that the Liberal Party was not the straightforward progressive party that wanted to hand political power to the working-class and that the Conservatives did not promote reform in reaction to working-class pressure. Cowling instead placed much more importance on parliamentary manoeuvres.Charles Covell, The Redefinition of Conservatism. Politics and Doctrine (Macmillan, 1986), p. 152. Robert Blake thought that this book \\"gives the most convincing account of what happened\\".Robert Blake, The Conservative Party from Peel to Major (Arrow, 1998), p. 101. In 1971 appeared The Impact of Labour, which dealt with the years between 1920, after Labour won the Spen Valley by-election, and 1924 when the Conservatives won the general election of that year and ended the Liberal Party as a realistic party of government, with the Labour Party emerging as the Opposition. In 1975 appeared The Impact of Hitler, dealing with 1933 to 1940. Cowling has been described as an \\"isolationist imperialist\\"Ghosh, p. 281. who argued that from Britain's point of view the Second World War was a \\"liberal war which had been entered into in a condition of moral indignation without the resources to fight it\\" and that it had been \\"providential good fortune which had placed the burden of fighting on the Russians and the Americans\\".Cowling, Mill and Liberalism, p. xv. He disapproved of the fact that the war was followed by a Labour electoral landslide, a greatly expanded welfare state and the liquidation of the British Empire.Cowling, The Impact of Hitler, p. 391, p. 399. The policy making process for Cowling is heavily influenced by party politics. Cowling was well known for his Primat der Innenpolitik (\\"primacy of domestic politics\\") explanations for British foreign policy; for example, he argued that the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland issued on 31 March 1939 was advanced to improve the Conservatives' chances against Labour, and had nothing to do with foreign policy considerations.Strang, G. Bruce \\"Once more onto the Breach\\" pages 721‚Äì752 from Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 31, 1996 page 722 Cowling's approach is the opposite of the Primat der Au√üenpolitik (\\"primacy of foreign politics\\") thesis. Religion and Public Doctrine in Modern England In 1980, 1985 and 2001 appeared the three volumes of Cowling's Religion and Public Doctrine in Modern England. The political history books required \\"tiring archival visits\\"; Cowling much preferred writing these. In researching for these books \\"He spent his days in his college rooms, muscularly grappling with books, indeed often physically ripping them apart. Made up of hundreds of essays on the thought of individuals, the work neither engaged with other scholarship nor developed an interpretative model for understanding modern Britain\\". Cowling placed Christianity squarely at the centre of English culture post-1840 and claimed that anti-Christians more often than not held traditional religious assumptions and prejudices. Secularisation was not so fast or complete as had been previously argued, but \\"defenders of orthodoxy as well as their assailants were subjected to pithy, provocative irony\\" by Cowling.

In the 1980s, breakdancing and graffiti were the first elements of hip hop culture to preface the Irish hip hop movement, which had started to emerge in Ireland. 1980s to 1990s When hip hop got its foothold in Ireland there were many rap groups around to give it a good start, from the mid 1980s after the breakdance era, they included groups like Craic Pipe (1991) The Rathcoole Posse(Colz), Dis is It (Dj Control), Chrome Angels, MC Tyson, Cut Master Jay & the Majestic M.C. (who would later join Jus Like Family), Gun Point, Jus Like Family, Death Squad, ScaryEire, Marxman, Ghost'n'Jay, DJ Troubledsoul & Hidden Identity, plus Fresh beatz Incorporated from Belfast. All produced tracks and some did live shows, while they were all the very roots of the emerging scene, not all continued on into the early to mid 1990s to continue production and live shows, the one's that did pursue were Marxman, Scary √âire, Ghost'n'Jay, Jus Like Family, First Kouncil, and Belfast natives DJ Troubledsoul, MC Hidden Identity, and Fresh Beatz Incorporated. In 1991, a group called Duffel (formed at the Ballyfermot Rock School), became Ireland's first hip hop band, consisting of live drums, guitar, keyboards, bass, Turntablist, and M.C. Meanwhile, Also in 1991 in Belfast - DJ Troubledsoul, Hidden Identity & Fresh Beatz Incorporated performed the first Live Hip-Hop Showcase in Northern Ireland at the Errigle Inn. MC Hidden Identity / MC B Fast Hidden Identity real name Bennett John aka MC B Fast Was the first MC from Northern Ireland to gain recognition in Great Britain. Winning a competition open to the UK in 1987 he went on to write a jingle for the Red Cold Coca-Cola advertising campaign played on radio stations through out Europe whilst the rapper was featured in the News of the World and Smash Hits magazine. Recording his album mixtape \\"Hidden era made clearer\\" with Simon Milligan (DJ Troubled soul) he quickly gained notoriety as a credible underground artist writing about his experiences and views on the troubles of Ireland. The artist was interviewed by Face magazine in 1989 and featured on several popular TV shows not ail you the BPM Show on Chanel 4, BBC 2's Hypnosis and Sky TV. The rapper also worked live shows with DJ Chris Caul in the 1990s playing venues across Belfast and Glasgow. The multi genre MC also known as MC BFast was a prominent figure on the Irish dance music scene in the 1990s. Bfast also appeared in the documentary Dancing on Narrow Ground, filmed for Dispatches in the late 1990s whilst co-running the largest underground illegal rave in the province. In 2000 B Fast moved to Australia and recorded with the AMEN, and Rogue Traders. MC B Fast was the guest MC on Ministry of Sound's \\"Two step the album\\" which was number 1 in the Australian HMV charts for four weeks in 2000 earning him residencies in Melbourne's Revolver and Club UK and live performances on channel V at Kix fest. The MC presented radio shows weekly to a live audience called True Step with James Ash on Melbourne's Kiss FM in 2000. =DJ Troubledsoul (now - Bethaniens Dust)= Started DJing in 1988. Belfast native. DJ, Label owner (Equilibrium Recordings & The Fear) and club pioneer. 1990 started the First Hip Hop Club in Northern Ireland (Katch22) along with MC B-Fast, DJ Triple Cee ( Chris Caul ) and Sconney from The Belfast City Breakers. 1991 Produced the first Full length Irish Hip-Hop LP entitled 'A Hidden Era Made Clearer' with MC Hidden Identity, bringing a unique perspective on being brought up surrounded by 'The Troubles' of the time (archive audio available from Community Skratch Music). 1992 - 2005 Organised various club nights promoting Hip-Hop culture, such as the legendary Melting Pot nights in Dublin, where he was based from 1995. He also presented a weekly Radio Show on Power FM from 1996 until 2003. In 1998 he was to play at the Kohoutek Festival in Los Angeles, supporting The Roots, Abstract Tribe Unique, and Aceyalone on his Book Of Human language Tour, he settled in Seattle collaborating with Heavens Weapons & B.Boy Genre (later to become Giant Panda). Returned to Dublin in 2000 Starting Equilibrium Recordings (First Hip Hop Specialist Label in Ireland), continuing a new solo practice in improvisational techniques and live performance, also performing as an original member of Heavy Flow and contributing producer for Melodica Deathship and as part of the critically acclaimed Free Jazz Quintet Trouble Penetrator. Migrating to Berlin in 2005, where he was to become a member of the Avante Garde / Experimental Music Collective Zentrale Randlage, living and performing there until 2014, when he returned to Belfast. He has been one of the only Producers from the early era of Irish Hip-Hop to remain prolific in production until this day - performing live, and publishing music consistently under his Bethaniens Dust moniker (ex Epigon A.D:M & one half of Shallowbliss) via All City Records (Dublin), Narcorpses Music (Czech), The Content Label (USA), Dreckzloch44 Records (Berlin), Nohmad Netlabel (Belgium), and more recently Publishing Music on the Portland-based Indie Cassette and Vinyl Imprint IHAA Records (see the'Irish Hip Hop Releases' section below for full details). =Scary √âire= Scary √âire were pioneers of the hip hop scene in Ireland and the first Irish rap act to be signed to a major label (Island Records). Although the band had little commercial success, they were said to be excellent live and had a large cult following. The group's name is a play on the Irish language word √âire. The band consisted of two rappers (frontman R√≠-R√° and hypeman Mr Browne), and two DJ's (Mek and Dada Sloosh). D.J. Mek (winner of 5 Irish Disco Mix Club titles) had met R√≠-R√° and Dada Sloosh working in Tullamore's pirate radio station Kiss F.M. in 1987. All three were involved in earlier rap groups (DaBadaPak and Noiz.Inc) but joined forces in 1990 and recruited Dublin breakdancer Mr. Browne as hypeman and second vocalist. In 1991 they recorded their early demos in RadioActiv Studios, Bray, which included a Hip Hop reworking of Linton Kwesi Johnson's protest song \\"Fite Dem back\\". The recordings led to a string of notorious gigs in Dublin rock venues such as Fibber Magees (Parnell Street) and Barnstormers (a biker bar on Capel Street). A bidding war began as U.K. and International record companies tried to sign them. The band almost signed with Mo Wax but eventually went with Island Records as it was home to some of their musical heroes. They recorded a debut album that included contributions from Howie B, Tricky and Cutmaster Swift; but were then dropped by Island Records, who kept the rights to the album but did not release it. The band continued to record and play live, including opening for U2 on their Zooropa tour, and supporting many acts such as Madness, Beastie Boys and House of Pain. Tommy Boy records featured one of their tracks (\\"Lost for Words\\") on the 1993 album Planet Rap. In 1995 Scary √âire reappeared on London independent label 11 Records and released \\"Dole Q\\"/\\"That's No Good To Me\\" as a 12\\" single. The former song is about their various comical encounters on dole day and the latter a rugged, frenzied cypher. In March 2007, the group released The Scary Era - a collection of archive songs that had been shelved since the early 1990s. R√≠-R√° continues to perform live and has released new material including the \\"Horses work for donkeys wages\\" album and several singles.

DJ Mek has remixed tracks for Ian Brown, Sweetie Irie, La Coka Nostra, The Frames, Gemma Fox and Dirty Dubsters. . =Marxman= Marxman were two Dubliners (MC Hollis Byrne and electronic musician Ois√≠n Lunny) and two British Jamaicans (rapper MC Phrase and scratch mixer DJ Kay One) who brought out the album 33 Revolutions Per Minute on Talkin' Loud in 1993.

It featured collaborations with Irish folk music guru D√≥nal Lunny (father of group member Ois√≠n Lunny), Sin√©ad O'Connor (who had also worked with McLyte on the track \\"I Want Your (Hands on Me)\\"), DJ Premier (who produced \\"Drifting\\"), trad group Storm, and several others. They gained notoriety for the track \\"Sad Affair,\\" which protested against the presence of British troops in Northern Ireland; the track was banned by the BBC and most other UK radio stations for featuring lyrics such as \\"A six-county state is a bastard state / Why oh why can't we all integrate\\". This was followed in 1994 by an EP titled The Cynic, which cut down on the traditional influences and included some mellow instrumental tracks influenced by Massive Attack. In 1995 they released the Time Capsule LP on the More Rockers label, which was received without too much fuss. The band called an end to the project in 1995. Since then the group has branched out to do other work, including introductory music for the Irish television channel Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge, running their Pawnshop label, Oisin Lunny's soundtrack work, and recording under the name Minatone on Howie B's Pussyfoot label. =Ghost'n'jay= Ghost 'n' Jay were part of the first wave of Irish hip-hop that emerged in the late 1980s.

A spoof of slasher horror films such as Halloween, Friday the 13th and Prom Night, Student Bodies was the first film to satirize the thriving slasher film genre. A prominent feature of the film is a body count that is superimposed onscreen whenever a death occurs. Plot Student Bodies is about a serial killer who stalks students at Lamab High School, while at the same time, voyeuristically watching them. The killer calls himself \\"the Breather\\", presumably because the killer is always breathing heavily. The Breather enjoys stalking victims over the telephone and, much like Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th films, he hates seeing youngsters having sex. The Breather uses many unusual objects to kill his female victims such as a paper clip, a chalkboard eraser and a horsehead bookend. The film itself ends with several twists: initially, it is revealed that the Principal and his elderly female assistant are working as a duo as \\"the Breather\\", even though they are shown at one point in the film in the same room as other characters when the Breather contacts the school in order to threaten to commit further murders. The film then goes to reveal that the entire film was a fevered dream, caused by the main character Toby being sick and consumed by overwhelming sexual repression. In a send-up of the film The Wizard of Oz, many characters are revealed to be much the opposite of what they appeared to be for the bulk of the film: the jock-like shop instructor is really the school's French teacher, the stuck-up would-be prom queen is actually the school nerd (who is given the crown by Toby after she wakes up, due to her kind nature), the two handicapped kids turn out to be ablebodied, and a local ROTC cadet is a hippie. After being released from the hospital, Toby and her boyfriend are about to have sex, at which point he puts on gloves similar to the ones worn by the Breather and strangles Toby, as he has lost respect for her. However, in a homage to the nightmare-ending of the film Carrie, Toby's hands rise up from the freshly dug grave after her funeral to attack her killer. Cast * Kristen Riter as Toby Badger * Matt Goldsby as Hardy * Cullen Chambers as Charles Ray * Richard Belzer as the Breather (credited as Richard Brando)https://tv.avclub.com/richard- belzer-1798222737/amp * Joe Flood as Mr. Dumpkin * Joe Talarowski as Principal Harlow Hebrew Peters * Mimi Weddell as Miss Mumsley * Dario Jones as Mawamba * Carl Jacobs as Dr. Sigmund * Peggy Cooper as Ms. Van Dyke * Janice E. O'Malley as Nurse Krud * Kevin Mannis as Scott * Sara Eckhardt as Patti Priswell * Oscar James as Football Coach/Sheriff * Kay Ogden as Ms. Leclair * \\"The Stick\\" (Patrick Boone Varnell) as Malvert the janitor * Brian Batytis as Wheels * Joan Browning Jacobs as Mrs. Hummers * Angela Bressler as Julie * Keith Singleton as Charlie Production notes Student Bodies features a cast of true unknowns; most of them (including leads Riter and Goldsby) have never made another feature film (Riter did appear as a dancer in the J. Geils Band's \\"Centerfold\\" music video; her resemblance to MTV's Martha Quinn led to an urban legend that the VJ was in the video). Third-billed Cullen Chambers has appeared in numerous films and TV shows since 1981, but his main employment has been as a body double for such actors as Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker. The best-known performer in the film is probably Mimi Weddell, an actress in her 60s who later went on to play several roles on film and TV, including a grandmother in the hit series Sex and the City. Comedian Richard Belzer was the voice of the Breather. Mickey Rose wrote and directed the film, with executive producer Jerry Belson offering additional material; however, Michael Ritchie was placed on set as an overseeing producer to guide Rose should he need it. Some sources say that Ritchie was actually the co- director/writer and had to take the \\"Alan Smithee\\" credit due to a strike by the Writer's Guild of America; others maintain that he took said credit to distance himself from the project. Mickey Rose was (and is) also a WGA member and received full credit; this would seem to debunk the \\"union problem\\" rumors. =R-rating= Student Bodies contains no graphic violence or foul language‚Äîuntil 26 minutes into the film, when the action is interrupted by a man sitting at a desk. He explains that, in order to achieve an R-rating, a film \\"must contain full frontal nudity, graphic violence, or an explicit reference to the sex act.\\" He intones that R-rated films are by far the most popular, so \\"the producers have asked me to take this opportunity to say, 'Fuck you'.\\" A slide indicating that the film has been indeed given an R-rating by the MPAA appears for a few seconds (a rare instance of the MPAA rating appearing during a film),http://companybumpers.wikifoundry.com/page/Motion+Picture+Association+of+America after which the movie continues. =Parodies= The film parodies several slasher and horror films, including Carnival of Souls, Black Christmas, Carrie, Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, The Shining, Friday the 13th and Prom Night. =\\"The Stick\\"= One of the film's oddest aspects is a character called Malvert, a creepy-looking janitor (itself a familiar trope in slasher films). Malvert mumbles, does bizarre things like urinate into wastepaper baskets (\\"Sometimes Malvert pee red!\\" being one of the film's more memorable lines) and moves about in a herky-jerky fashion (at film's end, Malvert is revealed to be something of a sophisticate; when Toby informs him that he was a janitor in her dream, he responds, \\"Absurd!\\"). Malvert was played by a tall, double-jointed stand-up comedian known only as \\"the Stick\\", who made no other films; his only other credit seems to be as a guest appearance in the pilot episode on the 1984 TV series Out Of Control. Several online reviews give the film itself a mixed reaction, but praise the Stick's performance.Student Bodies review from KnobbyGirl.comStudent Bodies review from ISCFC.netMisunderstood Masterpieces: Student Bodies from 411mania.com An obituary from the Corsicana Daily Sun dated May 8, 1989, confirms that the Stick's real name as Patrick Boone Varnell, born in Lawton, Oklahoma on January 22, 1941. He died at Medical City Dallas Hospital in Dallas, Texas on May 7, 1989, aged 47. His body was donated to science by his sister who was a lab technician in Corsicana at the time of his death.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txnavarr/obituaries/pg90387.htm#Patrick_Boone_Stick_Varnell =Filming locations= Lamar Consolidated Junior High School in Richmond, Texas ‚Äì called Lamab in the film (not to be confused with Lamar High School in Houston, Texas which is known for its use in the film Rushmore) - and James E. Taylor High School in Katy, Texas were used for the film's football stadium, as well as for exterior and some interior scenes. The parade scene was filmed in downtown Houston, on Main Street. Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Texas Southern University, with Hannah Hall (the administration building) used for classroom and hallway shots. Members of TSU's football team were also used in the movie. The 1980 Thomas Jefferson High School Yellow Jackets football team sporting their maroon and gold school colors played the visiting football team in the movie. Release One of a group of films directed towards teenaged audiences during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Student Bodies grossed $5.2 million at the box office. It became famous as a late-night cult favorite on cable afterwards, appearing frequently on the Rhonda Shear-hosted USA Up All Night, as well as the network's USA Saturday Nightmares double feature series. The DVD was released on June 3, 2007. The HD Blu-ray version was released May 3, 2011. Critical reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"a real disappointment,\\" writing that it \\"just slowly topples over as you watch it, like a stand-up comedian in the act of failing.\\" Variety found that the jokes became \\"depressingly repetitive,\\" writing that \\"unfortunately, once you've seen the trailer, you've seen all but one of the good gags included in the entire film, meaning that there are about three minutes of effective material over the course of the 86-minute running time.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave it two stars out of four, writing that it \\"exposes all its comic tricks in the first reel, suggesting that the genre itself is not all that deep and that there may be less to parody than one might think.\\"Siskel, Gene (August 11, 1981). \\"'Bodies' just a ghost of horror parody\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 8. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The film has some very funny moments, but it is definitely not another 'Airplane!'.\\"Gross, Linda (August 11, 1981). \\"Comical Parts In 'Student Bodies'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 4. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Although it frequently misfires and occasionally keeps firing away on empty satiric chambers, 'Student Bodies' is a likeably sarcastic and knowing assault on the clich√©s of horror movies.\\" AllMovie wrote, \\"Student Bodies, though occasionally very funny, is not consistent enough to recommend as a comedy or scary enough to be an effective horror film.\\" References External links Category:1981 films Category:1981 horror films Category:1980s comedy horror films Category:1980s high school films Category:1980s parody films Category:1980s serial killer films Category:1980s slasher films Category:1980s teen comedy films Category:1980s teen horror films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American films Category:American high school films Category:American parody films Category:American serial killer films Category:American slasher films Category:American teen comedy films Category:American teen horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Michael Ritchie Category:Films set in Houston Category:Films shot in Houston Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films about proms Category:Parodies of horror Category:1981 comedy films ","title":"Student Bodies"},{"id":"1260101","text":"Zoomorphology is a quarterly academic journal published by Springer-Verlag Germany of Berlin, Germany.

Other terms for reading readiness include early literacy and emergent reading. Children begin to learn pre-reading skills at birth while they listen to the speech around them. In order to learn to read, a child must first have knowledge of the oral language. According to the Ontario Government (2003), the acquisition of language is natural, but the process of learning to read is not‚Äîreading must be taught. This belief contradicts basic language philosophy, which states that children learn to read while they learn to speak. The Ontario Government (2003) also believes that reading is the foundation for success, and that those children who struggle with reading in grades 1‚Äì3 are at a disadvantage in terms of academic success, compared to those children who are not struggling. Because a child's early experience with literacy-related activities is highly correlated to the child's success with reading, it is important to consider a child's developmental level when choosing appropriate activities and goals. Early and enjoyable pre-reading experiences set the stage for a child's desire to learn. By participating in developmentally-appropriate activities (activities that are fun and challenging, but not frustrating), the child gains knowledge that will serve as the foundation for further learning as he or she enters the school system. Reading readiness is highly individualistic. There is no \\"one size fits all\\" solution to teaching a child to read. A parent or educator may need to employ several techniques before finding the most appropriate method for an individual child. According to Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development a child can, through the help of an adult or more capable child, perform at a higher level than he or she can independently. The process of learning to read should thus be supported by a caring and supportive individual. Reading readiness skills Skills that indicate whether a child is ready to learn to read include:Learning First Alliance, What Kids Should Know Before Entering First Grade, (1998) , retrieved August 27, 2007.National Institute for Literacy, A Child Becomes a Reader: Birth through Preschool, 2003. Retrieved August 27, 2007. *Age-appropriate oral language development and vocabulary *Appreciation of stories and books *Phonemic awareness (ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds of language) *Understanding of basic print concepts (for example, printed text represents spoken words; spaces between words are meaningful; pages written in English are read left to right starting at the top of the page; books have a title and an author, and so on). *Understanding of the alphabetic principle (letters represent the sounds of language) *Ability to distinguish shapes (visual discrimination) *Ability to identify at least some letters of the alphabet. Instructional programs for reading Whole language: With this model, language is kept whole rather than segmented into fragments or skills. Within this philosophy, children are expected to learn to read and write in the same manner that they learn to talk. Reading, writing and oral language are considered to be intertwined. Some strategies according to the whole language model include encouraging the child to learn to read by \\"reading,\\" and making up stories that they think go along with the pictures in the book. This model also believes that adults should allow the child to witness reading behaviors, such as holding a book properly. It is also important for adults to model these behaviors in an environment that is free from criticism (Matthews, Klassen and Walter, 1999). An early proponent of whole language reading instruction called reading a \\"psycholinguistic guessing game,\\" and thus children are taught to guess words that they don't know by using context clues. Skipping unknown words is encouraged, and \\"inventive\\" spelling is also acceptable. Phonics: This approach involves teaching the correspondence between graphemes (spelling patterns) and phonemes (sounds). Other reading tips It is suggested that by providing the children with the knowledge of spelling patterns (that is, the combination of letters that are likely to occur within the English language) that spelling and reading will become much easier for the child. It is thought that once we (as adults) really look at the rules to the English language we use everyday and have internalized within ourselves, that it will become clear that there is some order and regular patterns that we follow. Once we are aware of these patterns, we can help children begin to understand these rules that we follow on a daily basis. Some suggestions for reading skills *Read to the child. *Have the child \\"read\\" to you. Allow the child to create their own story based on the pictures they see within the book. *Reread stories multiple times. *Omit words of a familiar story and allow the child to fill in the blank. *Allow the child to experiment with words. *Point to the words on the page as you read out loud to the child. This enables the child to understand that sentences consist of separate words. Influential perspectives The two most influential perspectives are the growth-readiness view and the environmentalist view. The growth-readiness view focuses on the internal workings of the child in order to determine readiness, while environmentalists focus on the external environment. Both internal factors such as genetics and environmental aspects such as school atmosphere can influence a child's readiness for reading. Book list The following is a list of books that are great for young readers. They contain vital elements such as repetition and bright colors. Many of these books also encourage the child to use their imagination by filling in the blank and taking an active role in the story. *Allan, Nicholas. (2000). You‚Äôre All Animals.

Argentan is located NE of Rennes, ENE of the Mont Saint-Michel, SE of Cherbourg, SSE of Caen, SW of Rouen and N of Le Mans. History Heavy fighting in August 1944, following the Allied invasion of Normandy, left the town in ruins. SNCF train station Argentan is situated near the Orne River. Although the region was heavily populated during the Gallo Roman period the town is not mentioned until 1025‚Äì1026. The toponym comes from the Gaulish words (\\"silver\\") and (\\"market\\"). The town grew in importance during the Middle Ages. Throughout the Middle Ages, Argentan alternated between prosperity and destruction, as English forces occupied the city several times. The Plantagenets had considered this town as one of the most important of Normandy. During the reign of Louis XIV, Colbert set Alen√ßon against Argentan in an economic competition on lace making. Thus, the point d'Argentan (\\"Argentan stitch\\") and the point d'Alen√ßon (\\"Alen√ßon stitch\\") were created. Argentan became a very important town for traditional industry. It also gained in religious importance with the building of a Benedictine Abbey and two churches, Saint-Martin and Saint-Germain. Several mansions (h√¥tels particuliers) were also built. During World War I, the French 104th Infantry Regiment/14th Infantry Brigade was stationed at Argentan. It participated in the battle of Verdun in 1916. During World War II, the city was almost totally destroyed. On 5 June 1944, on the eve of the Allied D-Day landing on the beaches of Normandy, the city suffered an important air raid in which the train station was destroyed.Destruction of Argentan SNCF train station in August 1944: http://argentan.vapeur.free.fr/gare_guerre.html (French site) The city suffered further damage when it was bombed on 6 and 7 June by B-17 and B-24 bombers of the U.S. Eighth Air Force.Freeman, Roger A., The Mighty Eighth, Motorbooks International, 1981, 1990, pp. 259 & 260. The greatest part of the city was, however, left in ruins two and half months later, at the end of August, during the battle of the Argentan-Falaise Pocket. The U.S. Third Army, under the command of general George S. Patton liberated Argentan after eight days of violent combat against the German 9th Panzer Division and the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The U.S. 80th Infantry Division liberated the city in the morning of 20 August.

In the digital era, significant outtakes have been appended to CD and DVD reissues of many albums and films as bonus tracks or features, in film often, but not always, for the sake of humor. In terms of photos, an outtake may also mean the ones which are not released in the original set of photos (i.e. photo shoots and digitals). Film An outtake is any take of a movie or a television program that is removed or otherwise not used in the final cut. Some of these takes are humorous mistakes made in the process of filming (commonly known to American audiences as bloopers). Multiple takes of each shot are always taken, for safety. Due to this, the number of outtakes a film has will always vastly outnumber the takes included in the edited, finished product. An outtake may also be a complete version of a recording that is dropped in favor of another version. Often outtakes can be found as special features on DVDs and Blu-rays. Purpose-made \\"outtakes\\" can also be found playing over credits at the end of a film or TV program. Well known examples of this are Jackie Chan and Disney/Pixar films, although in the latter only three movies were made with such as (A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc.). Pixar films, being computer-generated, do not feature \\"real\\" outtakes, but rather staged ones in which the animation features \\"mistakes\\". Outtakes may also enter stock footage libraries and appear in future productions. For example, Don't Tell Everything (1921) started as an outtake from The Affairs of Anatol (1921) and was then expanded with additional footage. It is generally considered that the inclusion of outtakes in a film's finished product started with Hooper (1978), helmed by stunt-man-turned- director Hal Needham and starring Burt Reynolds. Needham decided to include outtakes in the film's end credit scrawl to highlight alternate camera angles for the impressive stunts performed for the movie. Needham also interspersed comedic outtakes of the actors as well. The inclusion was so successful with fans that Needham continued to insert comedic outtakes in his future directorial efforts such as Smokey & The Bandit 2 (1980), The Cannonball Run (1981), Stroker Ace (1983) and Cannonball Run 2 (1984). =Criticism= Film critic Gene Siskel has been critical of outtakes being played over a film's credits, saying of the film Liar Liar:YouTube clip > This picture ends over the credits with outtakes. I hate that. I don't even > care if they're funny, I still hate it because to me it's almost like an act > of desperation from the filmmakers saying \\"Well we're not sure if we made a > funny picture, but we're gonna throw this stuff in and we'll leave you > laughing on the way out.\\" Television The British programme It'll be Alright on the Night, has been running on ITV since 1977 featuring outtakes. The BBC's answer to this was Auntie's Bloomers, eventually replaced by Outtake TV. Prior to these series, production errors were rarely seen for pre-recorded programmes, since these were edited out before transmission.Image Dissectors ‚Äì TV Trends: Conspicuous cameras Nowadays, it is common to see outtakes at the end of films, or compiled into programmes like these. Music Just like a movie outtake, music outtakes are recordings that are not used in a final version of an album. Collections of this sort of material are often compiled and distributed illegally by fans, and known as a bootlegged recording. Sometimes, artists release collections of outtakes, sometimes grouped with other rarities such as demos and unreleased songs. Occasionally collections of outtakes become recognized as part of an artist's major creative output, especially in cases where an artist is unusually prolific or dies young. One example would be The Lillywhite Sessions by Dave Matthews Band, an album that was considered unfinished and not ready to be distributed, yet is widely considered part of the discography of the band by their fans. An example of the former is the fourteen-volume Bootleg Series from Bob Dylan, which contains many important Dylan songs omitted from his albums, some of which were made famous by other artists. An example of the latter is the CD Time of No Reply by Nick Drake, a British singer-songwriter who died almost unknown at the age of 26 in 1974, but whose music became highly influential on other artists in subsequent decades. Video games In a similar vein as a music outtake, video game outtakes are elements (characters, levels, items, cutscenes, etc.) that weren't used in a game's final version. These can be unlocked via hacking or officially through demos. Examples include Crash Bandicoot, whose notable abandoned level \\"Stormy Ascent\\" can be unlocked through hacking. Similarly, Donkey Kong, Silver the Hedgehog, Cream the Rabbit, Jet the Hawk, Espio the Chameleon, Big the Cat and a Goomba can be unlocked via hacking on Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games.

The film is a sequel to Casper: A Spirited Beginning while it being the second prequel/spin-offs to the 1995 film Casper. Haim Saban, best known for creating the Power Rangers, serves as an executive producer for this movie, and his production company, Saban Entertainment, was also involved. This was the first major film for Hilary Duff, who was 10 years old when the film was released on September 22, 1998. It then aired on October 27, 1998, four days before Halloween, on Fox Family. Plot A mysterious \\"spaceship\\" floats over a baseball game eventually revealing Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso, The Ghostly Trio, who cause panic in the ballpark. Their nephew Casper, attempts to settle the terrified crowd, but they are just as scared of him as they are of his uncles. The park empties, and after watching their effect with satisfaction, Casper's uncles plan a vacation. Meanwhile, a malevolent warlock named Desmond Spellman believes himself to be the greatest warlock to have existed until he receives an unwelcome message from the Oracle in the Mirror, who tells him that in the future, none other than Wendy the Good Little Witch will surpass him in being the greatest witch ever. To avoid this, Desmond plans to get rid of her once and for all with the advised \\"Mystic Abyss\\", a dimensional rift that can destroy living beings upon entering. He then creates a pair of spies: Jules and Vincent, and assigns them to bring Wendy to him where she is living in the country with her three mischievous aunts: Gert, Gabby, and Fanny. Jules and Vincent arrive at Wendy's house to take the young witch, who narrowly escapes with her aunts. To keep Wendy safe from Desmond, her aunts hide and vacation at a resort hotel which happens to be the same place in which Casper and his uncles are vacationing. Casper and Wendy meet in a barn and, due to their amiable personalities and having been bossed around by their respective guardians, they become great friends. Unfortunately, her aunts and his uncles do not get along because ghosts and witches are natural enemies. However, the pair are certain their guardians would get along if they only got to know each other. In order to do that, they devise a plan. Casper tricks the Ghostly Trio to break the record for possession so that he can learn how to do it, and they possess three men at the party. Wendy convinces her aunts to go to the party to meet men. Thanks to their plotting, they meet and soon the Trio are flirting with the three witches, who are posing as regular women. Though everything goes well at first, with the ghosts and witches unwittingly enjoying each other's company and finding that they have a lot in common, the plan is spoiled when the possession wears off and the ghosts' real selves are revealed to Wendy's aunts, who, in turn, revealed their real selves and threaten them with magic. However, as Wendy explains to Casper, she and her aunts cannot use any high- level magic or else Desmond will be able to track them down. She begs Casper not to tell anyone about this. Unfortunately, when the Ghostly Trio suspects that Casper is protecting the witches, they interrogate and pressure him into blurting out that the witches cannot use their powers, prompting the Trio to terrorize Wendy and her aunts. Wendy feels she has no choice but to cast a high-level spell to cover the Trio in plaster, thus alerting Desmond's magic tracker of their location. Distraught that Casper broke his promise, Wendy ends their friendship. Casper soon confronts his uncles and tells them that Desmond is coming after the witches and they should help. The Trio scoff at first and refuse, but Casper reminded them that at the party the Trio showed that they could get along with the witches if they put their differences aside. Before the witches can evacuate the resort, Desmond and his spies arrive. After confronting the witches, Desmond explains the Oracle's prediction and, after trying to resist him, summons the Mystic Abyss and casts Wendy into it to destroy her, with Casper diving inside in an attempt to rescue her. Her aunts attempt to battle Desmond, but are no match for him. Before Desmond can turn the witches into fertilizer, a giant three-eyed monster appears and scares the warlock who, while recoiling in fear, trips and falls into the Abyss and to his doom. The monster turns out to be the Ghostly Trio, who have a change of heart and decides to help after they combine their powers to defeat Desmond. While they hold the door to the Abyss open, Wendy's aunts pull her and Casper out. Both Casper and Wendy are weak and unconscious; but with encouragement and comfort from their guardians, Casper is restored by his uncles and Wendy is treated by her aunts. After a touching reunion between the witches and an awkward one between the ghosts, the witches thank the Trio for helping them. The Oracle then proclaims that Wendy is the greatest witch because she did something no other witch ever could; she befriended a ghost. Later, Casper, his uncles, Wendy, and her aunts, all bid each other goodbye. Casper and Wendy assure each other they will meet again soon. Before flying back home with her aunts, Wendy gives Casper a goodbye kiss, causing him to blush.

The Arizona bark scorpion (Centruroides sculpturatus, once included in Centruroides exilicauda) is a small light brown scorpion common to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. An adult male can reach 8 cm in length (3.14 inches), while a female is slightly smaller, with a maximum length of 7 cm (2.75 inches).  Predators  Arizona bark scorpions are eaten by a wide variety of animals such as birds (especially owls), reptiles, and other vertebrates. Some examples include spiders, snakes, peccaries, rodents, and other scorpions. Development, pesticides and collecting scorpions for research or the pet trade also reduces the bark scorpion population. The painful and potentially deadly venom of Arizona bark scorpions has little effect on grasshopper mice. Scientists have found the scorpion toxin acts as an analgesic rather than a pain stimulant in grasshopper mice.  Life cycle  Three adult and four juvenile Arizona bark scorpions A female Arizona bark scorpion with young Arizona bark scorpions have a gestation period of several months, are born live, and are gently guided onto their mother's back. The female usually gives birth to anywhere from 25 to 35 young. These remain with their mother until their first molt, which can be up to 3 weeks after birth. Arizona bark scorpions have a life expectancy of about 6 years. Arizona bark scorpions, like most other scorpions, are incredibly resilient. During US nuclear testing, scorpions, along with cockroaches and lizards, were found near ground zero with no recorded adverse effects.  Habitat  The Arizona bark scorpion is nocturnal, and particularly well adapted to the desert: layers of wax on its exoskeleton make it resistant to water loss. Nevertheless, Arizona bark scorpions hide during the heat of the day, typically under rocks, wood piles, or tree bark. Arizona bark scorpions do not burrow, and are commonly found in homes, requiring only 1/16 of an inch for entry. Arizona bark scorpions prefer riparian areas with mesquite, cottonwood, and sycamore groves, all of which have sufficient moisture and humidity to support insects and other prey species. The popularity of irrigated lawns, and other systems which increase environmental humidity in residential areas, has led to a massive increase in the number of these animals in some areas. Centruroides scorpions are unusual in that they are the only genus in the Southwest that can climb walls, trees, and other objects with a sufficiently rough surface. Arizona bark scorpions practice negative geotaxis, preferring an upside down orientation, which often results in people being stung due to the scorpion being on the underside of an object. The Arizona bark scorpion preys on small and medium-sized animals such as beetles, spiders, crickets, cockroaches, other insects and other scorpions. The range of the Arizona bark scorpion is from southern California, southern Arizona and western New Mexico. They are also found in Baja California, Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico.  Venom  Frontal view of an Arizona bark scorpion in a defensive posture The Arizona bark scorpion is the most venomous scorpion in North America, and its venom can cause severe pain (coupled with numbness, tingling, and vomiting) in adult humans, typically lasting between 24 and 72 hours. Temporary dysfunction in the area stung is common; e.g. a hand or possibly arm can be immobilized or experience convulsions. It also may cause loss of breath for a short time. Due to the extreme pain induced, many victims describe sensations of electrical jolts after envenomation. Two recorded fatalities have occurred in the state of Arizona since 1968; the number of victims stung each year in Arizona is estimated to be in the thousands. In Mexico, more than 100,000 people are stung annually, and during a peak period in the 1980s, the Arizona bark scorpion claimed up to 800 lives there. = Antivenom= Arizona bark scorpion glowing under ultraviolet light An antivenom was developed for this species at Arizona State University by Dr. Herbert L. Stahnke, and produced in quantities sufficient to treat individuals within the state of Arizona. This antivenom was not FDA approved, but use within the state of Arizona was allowable and very successful in shortening the duration of symptoms and hospitalization. Production of this antivenom ceased by 2000 and the product was unavailable by 2004. A Mexican-produced antivenom, Anascorp [Antivenin Centruroides (scorpion) F(ab‚Ä≤)2, Laboratorios Silanes, Instituto Bioclon SA de CV], received FDA approval on August 3, 2011, and is now in use. = First aid = Basic first aid measures can be used to help remediate Arizona bark scorpion stings: * Clean sting site with soap and water * Apply a cool compress (cool cloth) * Take paracetamol or ibuprofen for local pain and swelling = Medical emergencies = Since the amount of venom an Arizona bark scorpion injects varies, Arizona poison control centers suggest immediate medical attention only in the event of extreme pain or stings involving weaker individuals.  UV lighting  Arizona bark scorpions, like most other scorpions, will glow when exposed to a blacklight. This is particularly useful in scorpion detection, since Arizona bark scorpions are active during the night, and can be easily spotted using this method. Typical UV LED flashlights enable their human operator to readily detect Arizona bark scorpions at a distance of approximately six feet. Newly molted Arizona bark scorpions will not glow under ultraviolet light for a few days after molting.  Control and prevention  Arizona bark scorpions are tan or light beige tone in color and very small, making them difficult to detect especially on natural terrain (rocky land, multiple vegetation and soil textured land). They are not known to seek out people, but look for places to hide unless provoked or defending their young. Several methods of control have historically been used to control Arizona bark scorpions, such as physical barriers (scorpions are unable to climb smooth surfaces), pesticides, glue boards, and removing any scorpion congregation areas in the vicinity of the building.

The local population (1.) serves as a source for hybridization with surrounding subspecies populations (1.a, 1.b, and 1.c).The populations are normally spatially separated and independent but spatial overlap during breeding times allows for gene flow between the populations. A metapopulation consists of a group of spatially separated populations of the same species which interact at some level. The term metapopulation was coined by Richard Levins in 1969 to describe a model of population dynamics of insect pests in agricultural fields, but the idea has been most broadly applied to species in naturally or artificially fragmented habitats. In Levins' own words, it consists of \\"a population of populations\\". A metapopulation is generally considered to consist of several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently unoccupied. In classical metapopulation theory, each population cycles in relative independence of the other populations and eventually goes extinct as a consequence of demographic stochasticity (fluctuations in population size due to random demographic events); the smaller the population, the more chances of inbreeding depression and prone to extinction. Although individual populations have finite life-spans, the metapopulation as a whole is often stable because immigrants from one population (which may, for example, be experiencing a population boom) are likely to re-colonize habitat which has been left open by the extinction of another population. They may also emigrate to a small population and rescue that population from extinction (called the rescue effect). Such a rescue effect may occur because declining populations leave niche opportunities open to the \\"rescuers\\". The development of metapopulation theory, in conjunction with the development of source‚Äìsink dynamics, emphasised the importance of connectivity between seemingly isolated populations. Although no single population may be able to guarantee the long- term survival of a given species, the combined effect of many populations may be able to do this. Metapopulation theory was first developed for terrestrial ecosystems, and subsequently applied to the marine realm.Kritzer, J. P. & Sale, P. F. (eds) (2006) Marine metapopulations, Academic Press, New York. In fisheries science, the term \\"sub-population\\" is equivalent to the metapopulation science term \\"local population\\". Most marine examples are provided by relatively sedentary species occupying discrete patches of habitat, with both local recruitment and recruitment from other local populations in the larger metapopulation. Kritzer & Sale have argued against strict application of the metapopulation definitional criteria that extinction risks to local populations must be non-negligible. Finnish biologist Ilkka Hanski of the University of Helsinki was an important contributor to metapopulation theory.  Predation and oscillations  The first experiments with predation and spatial heterogeneity were conducted by G. F. Gause in the 1930s, based on the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equation, which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted.Real, Leslie A. and Brown, James H. 1991. Foundations of Ecology: Classic papers with commentaries. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago. The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested that the relationship between predators and their prey would result in population oscillations over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator‚Äìprey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the population cycles accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly to the left of the peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator‚Äìprey oscillations.  Huffaker's experiments on predator‚Äìprey interactions (1958)  In order to study predation and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator and the other being the prey. He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator‚Äìprey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator‚Äìprey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.Janssen, A. et al. 1997. Metapopulation Dynamics of a Persisting Predator‚ÄìPrey system.  The Levins model  Levins' original model applied to a metapopulation distributed over many patches of suitable habitat with significantly less interaction between patches than within a patch. Population dynamics within a patch were simplified to the point where only presence and absence were considered. Each patch in his model is either populated or not. Let N be the fraction of patches occupied at a given time. During a time dt, each occupied patch can become unoccupied with an extinction probability edt. Additionally, 1 ‚àí N of the patches are unoccupied. Assuming a constant rate c of propagule generation from each of the N occupied patches, during a time dt, each unoccupied patch can become occupied with a colonization probability cNdt . Accordingly, the time rate of change of occupied patches, dN/dt, is : \\\\frac{dN}{dt} = cN(1-N) - eN.\\\\, This equation is mathematically equivalent to the logistic model, with a carrying capacity K given by : K = 1 - \\\\frac{e}{c}\\\\, and growth rate r : r = c - e.\\\\, At equilibrium, therefore, some fraction of the species's habitat will always be unoccupied.  Stochasticity and metapopulations  Huffaker's studies of spatial structure and species interactions are an example of early experimentation in metapopulation dynamics. Since the experiments of Huffaker and Levins, models have been created which integrate stochastic factors. These models have shown that the combination of environmental variability (stochasticity) and relatively small migration rates cause indefinite or unpredictable persistence. However, Huffaker's experiment almost guaranteed infinite persistence because of the controlled immigration variable.  Stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs)  One major drawback of the Levins model is that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how likely they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds. For conservation biology purposes, metapopulation models must include (a) the finite nature of metapopulations (how many patches are suitable for habitat), and (b) the probabilistic nature of extinction and colonisation. Also, note that in order to apply these models, the extinctions and colonisations of the patches must be asynchronous.  Microhabitat patches (MHPs) and bacterial metapopulations  E. coli metapopulation on-chip. By combining nanotechnology with landscape ecology, a habitat landscape can be nanofabricated on-chip by building a collection of nanofabricated bacterial habitats, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements and with nano-scale channels providing them with the local ecosystem service of habitat renewal. These landscapes of MHPs can be used as physical implementations of an adaptive landscape: by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a metapopulation system operating on-chip within a synthetic ecosystem. The metapopulation biology and evolutionary ecology of these bacterial systems, in these synthetic ecosystems, can be addressed using experimental biophysics.  Life history evolution  Metapopulation models have been used to explain life-history evolution, such as the ecological stability of amphibian metamorphosis in small vernal ponds. Alternative ecological strategies have evolved. For example, some salamanders forgo metamorphosis and sexually mature as aquatic neotenes. The seasonal duration of wetlands and the migratory range of the species determines which ponds are connected and if they form a metapopulation. The duration of the life history stages of amphibians relative to the duration of the vernal pool before it dries up regulates the ecological development of metapopulations connecting aquatic patches to terrestrial patches.

Keystone State was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1853 by J. W. Lynn. She was chartered by the navy on 19 April 1861 from the Ocean Steam Navigation Co. at Philadelphia, and purchased on 10 June 1861. She commissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 19 July 1861, Commander Gustavus H. Scott in command. Civil War service =Caribbean, 1861= Chartered to search for the Confederate States Navy raider CSS Sumter, Keystone State shared in the capture of Hiawatha at Hampton Roads on 10 May 1861. When her charter expired on 23 May, she returned to Philadelphia, where she was purchased for $125,000 from Alexander Heron Jr.,Philadelphia and the Navy Department, The Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) December 16, 1861, page 8, accessed August 16, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13128092/the_philadelphia_inquirer/ fitted out, and commissioned. She left the Delaware Capes on 21 July and cruised in the West Indies seeking Confederate blockade runners in Caribbean ports. On the high seas, she captured Saloon on 10 October and towed her to Philadelphia via Key West, Florida. =South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 1861-1863= At Philadelphia, Commander William E. Le Roy took command of the ship on 12 November. The sidewheeler stood down the Delaware River and out to sea on 8 December, visited Bermuda, and arrived at Hampton Roads on 26 December 1861. She got underway on 9 January 1862, and joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Charleston, South Carolina on 13 January. Ordered to the Florida coast, she engaged Confederate batteries at Amelia Island on 18 January and captured schooner Mars on 5 February. Keystone State arrived at Port Royal, South Carolina for refit and replenishment on 18 March, getting underway again on 29 March. She chased a blockade runner and fired at another on 3 April, but both escaped. On 10 April, she chased schooner Liverpool of Nassau ashore where she was burned to the water's edge. Schooner Dixie fell prey to the vigilant blockader on 15 April, steamer Elizabeth then struck her colors on 29 May, and schooner Cora surrendered two days later. Keystone State took blockade runner Sarah off Charleston on 20 June and pursued an unidentified steamer all day and night of 24 June before giving up the chase. She took schooner Fanny attempting to slip into Charleston with a cargo of salt on 22 August. However, this was dangerous work, and Keystone State well earned her long list of prizes. On 31 January 1863, she discovered a ship off Charleston, stood fast, and fired at her. The ship responded in kind, from time to time hitting the blockader. At 06:00, a shot ripped into Keystone States steam drum, scalding an officer and nineteen men to death and wounding another twenty. Later that morning, towed Keystone State to Port Royal for repairs. Ready for action again, she got underway on George Washington's Birthday (22 February) for blockading station off St. Simons Sound, Georgia, where she served until departing for Philadelphia on 2 June for repairs at the navy yard, where she decommissioned on 10 June. =North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 1863-1865= Keystone State recommissioned on 3 October, Cdr. Edward Donaldson in command, and stood out from Delaware Capes on 27 October. Three days later she joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Wilmington, North Carolina. While cruising off Wilmington, the veteran side wheeler captured the steamer Margaret and Jessie on 5 November. On 29 May 1864, she picked up 235 bales of cotton which had been thrown overboard by a chase; and the next day she captured steamer Caledonia. She took steamer Suez off Beaufort, North Carolina on 5 June and steamer Rouen at sea 2 July. On 26 July, she chased a steamer which escaped after throwing her cargo of cotton overboard. Keystone State then picked up over 60 bales. On a similar occasion on 8 August, she salvaged 225 bales. On 24 August, she chased and captured steamer Lilian and, with , in fact the Margaret and Jessie that the Keystone State had captured, picked up 58 bales. On 5 September, with , she chased and fired at steamer Elsie. A shell exploded in the blockade runner's forward hold, starting a fire which Keystone State extinguished. Keystone State then escorted her prize to Beaufort, North Carolina. First Battle of Fort Fisher, December 1864 During the fall of 1864, the sidewheeler continued blockade duty off the North Carolina coast; and, as winter set in, she prepared to attack Fort Fisher, which protected the important Confederate port of Wilmington. Shortly after dawn on Christmas Eve, Keystone State, steaming with the reserve squadron of the fleet in line of battle, got under way toward Fort Fisher. Her guns, firing over and between the ships in the first echelon, supported troops as they landed and fought to take the fort. However, late in the afternoon, the Union Army commander, General Benjamin Franklin Butler, decided that the Confederate works could not be taken and ordered his troops to reembark. Keystone State withdrew to Beaufort. Second Battle of Fort Fisher, January 1865 Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter, the Union Navy commander, was not to be thwarted. He renewed the attack on Fort Fisher on 13 January 1865 with a force of 59 warships. He sent some 2,000 sailors and marines ashore to aid the 8,000 Army troops led by Major General Alfred H. Terry. After three days of bitter fighting, the bravely defended Confederate fortress fell, closing the South's last supply line with Europe. Keystone State reached the scene before dawn on 16 January and received the wounded. =End of the War, 1865= After the capture of Wilmington, the sidewheeler continued to operate along the Carolina coast supporting clean-up operations which snuffed out Southern resistance. She got underway on 13 March towing monitor to Hampton Roads, and arrived at Baltimore, Maryland on 20 March. Keystone State decommissioned on 25 March and was sold at auction at Washington, D.C. on 15 September to M. O. Roberts. She was redocumented as SS San Francisco on 22 December, and operated in merchant service until 1879. References * ;Specific External links *U.S.S.

Career Retha Warnicke graduated with a B.A. from Indiana University, magna cum laude, in 1961. She then moved on to Harvard University, where she earned her M.A. and Ph.D. in 1963 and 1969, respectively. During her junior year, she joined Phi Beta Kappa and in her senior year, she was granted the Listenfelt Scholarship, for outstanding Undergraduate History Major, following in 1961 with the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. From 1965 to 1966, Professor Warnicke was an instructor at Phoenix College. She went on to teach at Arizona State University (ASU) as a Lecturer from 1966 to 1967. She then left to pursue her Ph.D. before returning to ASU to continue as a Lecturer from 1969 to 1973. Warnicke rose through the ranks to Assistant Professor, then Associate Professor and finally Professor in 1973, 1976 and 1984, respectively. She was the Director of Graduate Studies at the History Department from 1987‚Äì1992, and she was Chair of the History Department from 1992-1998. Professor Warnicke was the first woman hired in the History Department of ASU, and was one of the first to teach a Women's History course.Per correspondence with article subject, Warnicke was not \\"the first\\" but \\"one of the first\\" as the course was also taught by Professor Frederick Giffin, September 16, 2017. Through her advocacy, lobbying efforts and participation in numerous search committees, the History Department began to add women and minority men to the department ‚Äì and as a result, the History Department is nearly half female and has a large minority presence. In addition to her efforts in the History Department, Professor Warnicke has also devoted much of her time to affirmative action and faculty rights. Professor Warnicke specializes in politics and protocol at the Tudor court, women's issues in the Early Modern Period (1400 ‚Äì c. 1700) and Jacobean funerary rites for women. She authored numerous articles, including \\"Inventing the Wicked Women of Tudor England: Alice More, Anne Boleyn and Anne Stanhope\\" and \\"Sexual Heresy at the Court of Henry VIII\\". Warnicke is the author of seven monographs, including The Marrying of Anne of Cleves: Royal Protocol in Tudor England (Cambridge University Press, 2002), Mary, Queen of Scots (Routledge, 2006), and Wicked Women of Tudor England: Queens, Aristocrats, and Commoners (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012). Her most recent book is Elizabeth of York and Her Six Daughters-in-Law: Fashioning Tudor Queenship, 1485‚Äì1547 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017). The newest book examines the lives and reigns of Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII, and her six daughters-in-law, Henry VIII's six queens, by comparing them within important spheres of influence‚Äîas mothers, diplomats, and domestic managers, as well as participants in social and religious rituals. She is best known for her controversial theories over the life of Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn. These theories were outlined in various articles in the mid-1980s, \\"Anne Boleyn's Childhood and Adolescence\\" and \\"Sexual Heresy at the Court of Henry VIII\\". The theories were built on and elaborated in her 1989 book The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn: Family politics at the court of Henry VIII. Warnicke's theories on Anne Boleyn * She argued against the general theory that Anne Boleyn was born around 1501. Instead, she believes that Anne was born much later‚Äîin the summer of 1507. * The popular rumours that Anne had several small deformities‚Äîlike an extra fingernail or moles‚Äîare incorrect, since rumours of deformities only began after Anne's death and no-one who met her ever commented on them;‚Äî\\"... the two [descriptions] cannot logically be reconciled to each other. Had there been even a hint of a deformity in Anne's appearance, the Venetian, as well as the Imperial ambassadors...would have eagerly revealed this intriguing fact to their respective governments.\\" * \\"For many historians Anne remains the lady with the extra fingernail who was too flirtatious, even if in a harmless courtly way, for her own safety and well being. The result of this interpretation is that the responsibility for her tragic death resides with her, the victim, rather than with the king and his ministers, the ones who orchestrated her execution.\\" * Most importantly, she argues that Anne miscarried a deformed fetus in January 1536 which fueled 16th-century fears of witchcraft and sexual deviance and led to her execution‚Äî\\"In an attempt to understand her by the terms of her society, information from a wide range of sources will be used to support the argument that she miscarried a defective fetus in 1536. It was because Henry VIII viewed this mishap as an evil omen, both for his lineage and his kingdom, that he had her accused of engaging in illicit sexual acts with five men and fostered rumors that she had afflicted him with impotence and had conspired to poison both his daughter Mary and his illegitimate son, Henry, duke of Richmond.\\" Warnicke's theories were harshly criticised by some other historians‚Äîparticularly E.W. Ives and George W. Bernard. She defended her arguments in a 1993 article The Fall of Anne Boleyn Revisited, although she did not insist on some points as rigorously as before. She suggested that Ives's theory on Anne's fall (that it was caused by foreign policy and palace politics) was based on an over-reliance on Spanish sources and that his theory on her youth was ridiculous. Warnicke was even harsher with G.W. Bernard's suggestion that Anne might have been guilty of adultery in 1536. She called it a \\"dubious assertion\\" with no reliable documentary proof. She concluded: > As long as the lurid charges against the Queen exist only in unsubstantiated > indictments and contradictory diplomatic writings, historians ought to > remain sceptical about factional theories of her adulterous guilt or of > factional politics. At the least, they owe it to the past not to further > obscure the facts. In her \\"author's note\\" to bestseller The Other Boleyn Girl, Philippa Gregory said her novel's conclusion was based upon Warnicke's findings in The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn, but Warnicke has publicly distanced herself from the novel and its presentation of the Boleyns.

A tiled printing program overlays a grid on the printed image in which each cell (or tile) is the size of a printed page and then prints each tile. A person can then arrange the tiles to reconstruct the full image. Tiled printing has been widespread since the days of mainframe computers. An early example is the Unix \`banner\` program, which in some Unix variants created very large printable text banners out of ASCII characters. Programs were available to convert images to ASCII art that, when printed large enough and viewed sufficiently far away, appeared to be smoothly shaded. Modern software may use halftoning to achieve a similar effect. Another form of tiled printing, inspired by continuous feed printers, involves making a long message of letters, possibly with inline graphics of the same height, and printing it sideways over several pages to make a banner. This type of printing is usually associated with The Print Shop, a 1980s software package. Since high resolution images are used to create the prints, a large amount of ink is used in the process of making tiled prints. Inexpensive ink jet printers now allow people to make tiled printouts that do not sacrifice the original image's resolution at reasonable cost. These decorations are sometimes called rasterbations, after a popular tiled printing program, \\"The Rasterbator.\\" The Rasterbator program accepts users' images and divides them into a grid format. Users can specify how big the final product should be, in terms of pages. The Rasterbator then produces PDF images that when printed out, form the entire picture. World records The 2012 University of Toronto Schools rasterbation The Gathering 2013 Rasterbation is often the subject of record-breaking attempts to create the largest and most impressive tiled prints. The title of the world's largest rasterbation was previously held by \\"the Doomtech crew\\".http://rasterbation.doomtech.net/ However, in June 2007 the graduating class of the University of Toronto Schools, a Toronto high school, produced a rasterbation incorporating 1462 sheets of \\"√ó14\\" legal-sized paper.https://sites.google.com/site/shaniqua2007/Home This achievement surpassed the previous record by over two hundred sheets, but then was overtaken by a group from Groton School in May 2008. The Groton School Rasterbationhttp://maclellanimages.com/blog1/2008/07/01/my-prank/ used more than 1500 sheets of 11x14\\" paper and was 100' tall, making it the largest ever. In June 2012, another graduating class from the University of Toronto Schools produced 74 rasterbations in one night, each incorporating 143 sheets of √ó11\\" letter-sized paper, for a record-shattering total of 10,582 sheets. Each rasterbation included the face of one of the graduating students with a doorway cut out of his or her gaping mouth - altogether, they created a corridor of mouths throughout the school's hallways. In March 2013, a rasterbation of Edvard Munchs iconic painting The Scream was created at Norway's largest computer party The Gathering (TG), as part of the art project \\"Scream from nature\\".http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Skrik-blir- kunstprosjekt-pa-The-Gathering-7132277.html It is the largest known reprint of any Munch painting.

The CAW National Executive Board and staff endorsed then CAW Local 444 president Ken Lewenza to replace Hargrove as National President, and on September 6, 2008, Lewenza was formally elected to the position at a special union convention. In 1998, Hargrove co-authored the book Labour of Love: The Fight to Create a More Humane Canada with Wayne Skene. Also in 1998, Brock University honoured him with a Doctorate of Laws degree. He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Windsor in 2003, from Wilfrid Laurier University in 2004, from the University of New Brunswick in 2008, and from Queen's University in 2009. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Hargrove is seen as a proponent of social unionism, and his supporters claim that he has steered the CAW to become a more activist union. In the field of electoral politics, however, under his leadership the CAW has broken from its longtime support for the left-wing New Democratic Party and lent increasing support instead for the Liberal Party of Canada. Hargrove is married to Denise Small, a mediation officer for the Ontario Labour Relations Board. 1999 Ontario election Hargrove was the leading advocate of tactical voting (sometimes also called \\"strategic voting\\") in the 1999 Ontario provincial election. Hargrove proposed this approach in an attempt to defeat the Progressive Conservative Party government of Mike Harris. Hargrove's support for this approach, and his union's subsequent commitment of resources in its pursuit, marked the CAW's first major departure from its previous policy of unconditional support of the Ontario New Democratic Party, although the CAW had been somewhat estranged from the Ontario NDP ever since the union had opposed the \\"Social Contract\\" austerity measures imposed by the previous 1990-1995 Bob Rae NDP government. The 1999 election, however, was the first time that the union did not at least formally endorse the NDP, instead urging its members (and all voters) to vote for the candidate, NDP or Liberal, that had the best chance of defeating the Progressive Conservative candidate. Tactical voting not only failed to prevent the re-election of the Tories to another majority government but also was blamed by New Democrats for the party's poor electoral performance, returning only 9 Members of Provincial Parliament, down from 17 in the 1995 election. An attempt, following the 1999 Ontario election, to expel Hargrove from the Ontario NDP was defeated, but Hargrove's relationship with provincial leader Howard Hampton remained acrimonious. Federal politics pre‚Äì2006 Hargrove was also a long-time critic of federal NDP leader Alexa McDonough, calling for her resignation on several occasions. He criticized McDonough for her effort at modernizing federal NDP policy, which involved moving towards the political centre and adopting \\"Third Way\\" policies. Hargrove stated repeatedly that NDP should move to the left instead. In 2002, he planned to run for the NDP leadership, but found a \\"notable lack of enthusiasm\\" for his potential candidacy. He instead endorsed CAW lawyer Joe Comartin who placed fourth. Hargrove was initially much more publicly supportive of McDonough's successor, Jack Layton, and the CAW unequivocally supported the federal NDP in the 2004 federal election. The NDP made significant gains in popular vote but gained only 5 seats for a total of 19, well short of its aspirations of 40 or more. Hargrove reportedly played a role in bringing Prime Minister Paul Martin and Jack Layton together to negotiate a budget agreement to keep the federal Liberal government in power in exchange for including NDP proposals in the 2005 federal budget. However, Hargrove sharply criticized Layton when he joined with Conservative leader Stephen Harper and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe to bring down the Liberal government with a vote of non- confidence in November 2005. He also echoed his earlier criticism of McDonough by suggesting that Layton, too, was not sufficiently moving the party to the left. The eventual bringing down of the Liberal minority government led to a Conservative minority in the subsequent election. 2006 federal election =Tactical voting= For the 2006 Canadian federal election, Hargrove resumed his previous endorsement of tactical voting and urged CAW members (and all voters) to vote for the candidate, NDP or Liberal had the best chance of defeating the Conservative candidate. During the final days of the 2006 campaign, Hargrove urged all progressive voters in Canada to vote Liberal, which he claimed was the only party that could prevent the Conservative Party of Canada from winning the election. He publicly stated that \\"ideology does not matter\\" when the reporter asked about his position. Despite the qualification of his stated support for NDP incumbents and candidates in 40 \\"winnable\\" ridings, Hargrove's speech was widely reported by the media as an endorsement of the Liberals. When questioned by a reporter on this, Hargrove also stated that he \\"did not like the campaign that Jack Layton was running,\\" criticizing Layton for \\"spending too much time attacking the Liberals.\\" No doubt his photo-op appearance with Paul Martin in matching CAW jackets contributed to this impression. He has been reported as saying that voters should support incumbent NDP MPs and NDP candidates in ridings \\"where they can defeat the Conservatives.\\" =Break with NDP= Hargrove's strategy caused some controversy among long-time NDP activists and union members who saw him as reneging on core labour and left-wing values. Many of Hargrove's detractors argued that they were significantly affected by the Liberals measures to cut the deficit in the mid-1990s, which strained the health care system. Hargrove's controversial endorsements included 2006 federal Liberal candidates Greig Mordue, a Toyota manager, and Belinda Stronach of Magna International; Toyota maintained a non-unionized North American workforce and Mordue had successfully resisted CAW efforts to organize the Cambridge plant, while Magna was traditionally anti-union under former CEOs Frank Stronach and Donald Walker . In response, they carried anti-Hargrove placards at rallies and distributed buttons with the slogan: \\"Buzz Off. I'm voting NDP.\\" Traditional NDP supporters were also opposed to aligning their movement with the Liberals, who were embroiled in the Sponsorship and income trust scandals. Despite being one of Hargrove's 40 endorsed NDP candidates, Sid Ryan, president of the Ontario chapter of the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the candidate for Oshawa, blamed his loss on tactical voting. Ryan claimed Hargrove's statement confused potential NDP supporters in his riding and caused some of them to vote Liberal even though the Liberal candidate was not a viable contender. A poll in Oshawa found that the proportion of voters sampled who initially planned to vote for Ryan before switching their support to the third-place Liberal candidate late in the campaign (thinking it might help prevent a national Conservative victory) significantly exceeded the narrow margin of Ryan's loss - if the poll is accurate then the tactic did indeed result in Tory Colin Carrie's election. Some pointed out that Hargrove's call for strategic voting has also caused financial harm to the NDP under Canada's system of public financing for federal elections, which pays a subsidy to each federal party based on their popular vote. =Controversy= On January 18, 2006, Hargrove made a widely criticized speech at a Liberal rally in Ontario where he urged voters in Quebec to vote for the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois in preference to the Conservatives, calling Conservative leader Stephen Harper's view of Canada \\"a separatist view\\" and recommending \\"anything to stop the Tories\\". The statements forced Liberal leader Paul Martin to defend Harper later in the day by saying \\"I have profound differences with Mr. Harper, but I have never questioned his patriotism\\". Afterwards, many commentators viewed Hargrove as having been an active hindrance to the gaffe-filled Liberal campaign. Hargrove also attacked the principles of Albertans, and Stephen Harper in particular (though Harper was actually born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, moving to Alberta only in his early twenties), saying \\"His sense, is about Alberta, where the wealth in Alberta, everyone recognizes, is much greater than it is anywhere in Canada. The principles that (Harper's) brought up with, and believes in coming out of there, don't sit well with the rest of Canada.\\" =Results= Near the end of the 2006 campaign, sensing the momentum that would result in a Conservative victory, NDP leader Jack Layton defied Paul Martin and Hargrove's pleas to unite all progressive voters under the Liberal banner. Layton intensified his attacks on the Liberal scandals, while also pledging to use the NDP's clout in a minority government to \\"keep the Conservatives in check\\". The NDP increased their caucus to 29 seats, a significant gain over the 2004 election. Hargrove afterwards argued that strategic voting had prevented the Conservatives from forming a majority government and suggested that the three main opposition parties could form a coalition to get several key pieces of legislation passed. =Suspension from the NDP= Following the election, on February 11, 2006, the provincial executive body of the Ontario NDP voted to suspend Hargrove's NDP membership and effectively expel him from the party for supporting the Liberals. This move also automatically suspended his membership in the federal party; the NDP, unlike other major Canadian parties, is integrated at the federal and provincial/territorial levels. Hargrove stated he was \\"shocked and surprised\\" by this decision, but he would not apologize for his actions during the 2006 election nor would he commit not to endorse candidates for other parties in the future. On February 23, 2006, Hargrove also confirmed that he would not appeal the Ontario NDP executive body's decision. The CAW retaliated against the NDP for Hargrove's suspension by severing all union ties with the Party, a move formalized at the CAW's 2006 convention. 2006 CAW leadership race On December 9, 2005, Hargrove confirmed that he would seek a sixth and final three-year term as CAW President at the union's convention in Vancouver, British Columbia in August, 2006. This would be the final term that Hargrove would be eligible to serve under the CAW constitution, which provides for mandatory retirement at age 65. Hargrove was to be 62 years old at the time of the upcoming CAW convention. On February 8, 2006, Maclean's reported rumours that, for the first time, Hargrove may face an opposing candidate for the CAW presidency. CAW Local 1256 chair and Oakville and District Labour Council President Willie Lambert was subsequently confirmed as an opposition candidate. In 1999, Lambert won the support of over 40% of voting delegates at that year's Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) convention, in an unsuccessful challenge to Wayne Samuelson for the OFL presidency. On February 13, 2006, the CAW's former chief economist Sam Gindin raised a series of questions about the political, electoral and bargaining orientation of the CAW in an open letter addressed to Hargrove. That letter, Hargrove's response and Gindin's response to Hargrove were posted on the Canadian political website rabble. Gindin later wrote another piece criticizing recent bargaining concessions by the CAW at the General Motors plant in Oshawa, Ontario, which was published in the Socialist Project bulletin on March 22. On May 22, 2006, auto parts workers at A.G. Simpson in Oshawa, Ontario went on strike against their employer. Hargrove characterized the dispute as a \\"wildcat\\" (unauthorized) strike and criticized the workers involved, describing the situation as a \\"powder keg\\" that threatened other auto workers jobs. Hargrove's rival Lambert, however, fully supported the workers, joining the picket line and condemning Hargrove's conduct in an open letter. The labour dispute was successfully resolved on May 25, 2006, although the workers involved remained critical of Hargrove and the National CAW's interventions. On June 22, 2006, the executive committee of CAW Local 1256, Lambert's home local, adopted a motion to reconsider its support for Lambert's campaign and lend support instead to Hargrove. Lambert alleges that the local executive took this action at the prompting of Hargrove's executive assistant, Hemi Mitic, who allegedly threatened to dissolve Local 1256 and merge it into the larger CAW Local 707. Both Mitic and the local union president, James MacKenzie, deny this allegation. The motion to reconsider support for Lambert was overwhelmingly defeated by the general membership of Local 1256 on July 9, 2006, confirming that Local 1256 continued to support Lambert. The CAW's Constitutional Convention, at which the leadership election was scheduled to occur, took place Tuesday, August 15 through Friday, August 18 at the Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre. Delegates were scheduled to vote for CAW executive officers on Thursday, August 17. However, on Wednesday, August 16, the union announced that Lambert had withdrawn his candidacy for CAW president, leaving Hargrove unopposed. This was, however, a half-truth. According to standard union practice, candidates for CAW offices must be nominated before they can run. As Lambert was not himself a delegate, the decision on whether or not he was able to contest the presidency fell to the nearly 1000 elected delegates present. Since no one came forward, even delegates from his own local which had recently declared its unanimous support for his candidacy-‚ÄîLambert was effectively barred from contesting the leadership and Hargrove was therefore acclaimed for another term. Basking in the glow of his \\"victory\\", Hargrove concluded his acceptance speech by proposing to his long-time girlfriend Denise Small. Small accepted. The two were subsequently married at a small, private ceremony in Toronto on December 22, 2007. Hargorve criticized the Ontario legislature when all three parties (Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, and NDP) passed emergency back-to-work legislation, after a wildcat strike by the Toronto Transit Commission union. 2007 Ontario election In the 2007 Ontario provincial election the CAW as a union again endorsed strategic voting. Hargrove, however, again went further to slam both the NDP and its leader, Howard Hampton. He told the editorial board of the Toronto Star that the NDP had \\"lost complete touch\\" with the people of Ontario and that he saw \\"absolutely no reason to vote NDP.\\" Hargrove then went on to lavish praise on the Ontario Liberals, claiming the party had been \\"more left than the NDP over the last four years\\" and predicting left-leaning voters would vote Liberal in the upcoming election. The Ontario Liberal Party ultimately won a second consecutive majority government.

It is bordered by Westchester County to the North, the South Bronx to the south, the Hudson River to the west and the Long Island Sound to the east. The western part is more urbanized and hilly than its eastern counterpart, just like the rest of the borough. Despite being recognized as different from the South Bronx, the actual borders of the North Bronx is undefined. One commonly set border is Fordham Road/Pelham Parkway, the upper limit for widespread poverty and arson during the 1970s and 1980s. Overall, the North Bronx is better off than its southern neighbor despite gentrification occurring in both. The North Bronx has the affluent cluster of neighborhoods centered around Riverdale, including the former, Fieldston, Spuyten Duyvil, Hudson Hills, and to a lesser extent, Kingsbridge. The North Bronx is home to the largest shopping district along Fordham Road, with shops as far west as University Avenue and as east as Third Avenue. Tracey Towers, the second tallest buildings in the Bronx are located here. Only the Harlem River Park Towers are taller, at 404 feet compared to 400 feet for Tracey Towers. However, the North Bronx is home to the largest housing development in Co-op City. Neighborhoods include Riverdale, Bedford Park, Fordham, Norwood, Woodlawn Heights, Wakefield, Baychester, and Co-op City. History European contact with the Bronx first occurred almost 400 years ago. In 1609, Henry Hudson, probably the first European to see the shoreline, sought cover from a storm for his vessel the Halve Maen in Spuyten Duyvil Creek. Thirty years later in 1639, the mainland was settled by Jonas Bronck, a Swedish sea captain from the Netherlands who eventually built a farmstead at what became 132nd Street and Lincoln Avenue; a small group of Dutch, German, and Danish servants settled with him. Most of the eastern half of the area now known as the Bronx was bought in 1654 by Thomas Pell (named for Pelham Bay, Bronx) of Connecticut, who invited sixteen families to form the village of Westchester near what is now Westchester Square. Westchester was between 1683 and 1714 the seat of Westchester County (which included the Bronx until the second half of the nineteenth century) and as a chartered borough was the only town in the colony with an elected mayor. In addition, it was the first town without a property qualification for suffrage: settlers chose a representative to the provincial assembly and had their own municipal court. Horses, cattle, sheep and wheat were the main agricultural products and a cottage industry in cloth making thrived. During English rule most inhabitants were English, of English descent, or Dutch. Anglicanism was the religion sanctioned by colonial law, but Presbyterians, Quakers, and members of the Dutch Reformed church were in the majority. The first blacks, slaves from the West Indies, soon made up 10 to 15 percent of the population. Native Americans left the area soon after 1700. The North Bronx saw constant conflict During the American Revolution. Battle of Pell Point 18 about 750 men led Colonel John Glover Marblehead Massachusetts stayed march four thousand and Hessians enabling evacuate his White Plains In Westchester. For much rest war Bronx remained hands was subjected raids rebels that caused widespread destruction. November 1783, however Governor Clinton began a from Van Cortlandt Mansion take possession New York City departing English. During the early nineteenth century the chief occupations of lower Westchester County were growing wheat and raising livestock; between 1800 and 1830 the population rose from 1755 to 3023. Severe famine in Ireland and the growth of industry and commerce in the city drew thousands of Irish to the Bronx as laborers. Many Irish immigrants were employed in the construction of the High Bridge over the Harlem River, the New York and Harlem Railroad, and the Croton Aqueduct. Much of the area consisted of fertile lands that yielded fruits, vegetables, and dairy products for sale in the city. The first railroad tracks were laid over these lands, and rural stations eventually became the centers of new villages such as Melrose, Tremont, and Riverdale, Bronx. After the Second World War, new housing was built and the makeup of the population changed. Construction ranged from luxury apartment buildings in Riverdale to public housing in the southern Bronx. Longtime residents and former servicemen moved from older housing into privately built housing in the North Bronx. As commuting by automobile became more convenient, high-rise apartment building were erected in neighborhoods along the new roads, including Spuyten Duyvil and Riverdale. Co-op City, a complex of 15,372 units built in the North Bronx between 1968 and 1970, housed sixty thousand people and was among the largest housing developments in the world.

Most recently, Dominici has fronted his own self-named progressive metal band, who have released three albums. Biography Charlie Dominici was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. and soon after moved with his family to the Five Towns region in Nassau County, Long Island. Professionally, he came into prominence as a member of Franke and the Knockouts, in which he played guitar and sang backing vocals. He auditioned for Dream Theater in 1987 and was hired for the job in November of that year. Dominici performed on the band's debut album, 1989's When Dream and Day Unite. However, Dominici was older than the rest of the band and there were personal and creative differences at work. It was felt that, despite being a very talented singer, his decidedly \\"pop\\" vocal style did not fit in with the distinctive progressive direction that the band's compositions were taking. According to Dream Theater ex-drummer Mike Portnoy, \\"It was like having Billy Joel singing in Queensr√øche.\\" A good singer in the wrong band, they amicably parted ways shortly thereafter. Dominici remained in contact with Dream Theater throughout their career, despite lapsing out of the music business and obtaining a job as a finance manager in the automobile business. Dominici was hired by Mike Portnoy to sing at his wedding to Marlene Apuzzo. He started working on an album with his brother, guitarist Kane Daily, that never saw the light of day. In 2003 he released a song on his website entitled \\"Now The Time Has Come\\" but it was taken down after a few months, and the track did not feature any guitars, only piano. Dominici's voice was also heard on the YtseJam Records release \\"When Dream and Day Unite Demos\\" which featured pre-production and vocal demos of several songs, as well as Dominici singing Beatles Covers and the traditional Christmas song O Holy Night. On March 6, 2004, Dominici joined his former bandmates onstage in Los Angeles for the first time in 15 years for a special performance celebrating the 15th anniversary of the band's first album, singing on \\"To Live Forever\\" (a non-album track written in the same time period) and \\"Metropolis\\" along with LaBrie and former keyboardist Derek Sherinian. This performance was later released as \\"When Dream and Day Reunite\\", the DVD version of which also features footage from the band's 1989 tour with Dominici. Despite having not actively sung since leaving Dream Theater in 1989, this performance gave him the itch to make music again and in 2005, he released a solo album entitled O3: A Trilogy, Part 1, the first album of a three-album concept piece. The second installment of the trilogy, O3: A Trilogy, Part 2 was released in February 2007 and the final part, O3: A Trilogy, Part Three, was released in April 2008. Dominici opened for Dream Theater at three shows at their Chaos in Motion Tour in June 2007.

A drop of water splashing onto a hard surface A drop of water splashing onto a water surface, showing the formation of a back-jet Water drawn from a well falls on the well's splash plate In fluid mechanics, a splash is a sudden disturbance to the otherwise quiescent free surface of a liquid (usually water). The disturbance is typically caused by a solid object suddenly hitting the surface, although splashes can occur in which moving liquid supplies the energy. This use of the word is onomatopoeic; in the past plash has been used. Splash also happens when a liquid droplet impacts on a liquid or a solid surface. In this case, a symmetric corona is usually formed as shown in Harold Edgerton's famous milk splash photography. Historically, Worthington (1908) was the first one who systematically investigated the splash dynamics using photographs. Splashes are characterized by transient ballistic flow, and are governed by the Reynolds number and the Weber number. In the image of a brick splashing into water to the right, one can identify freely moving airborne water droplets, a phenomenon typical of high Reynolds number flows; the intricate non-spherical shapes of the droplets show that the Weber number is high. Also seen are entrained air bubbles in the body of the water, and an expanding ring of disturbance propagating away from the impact site. Small scale splashes in which a droplet of liquid hits a free surface can produce symmetric forms that resemble a coronet; milk is often used as it is opaque. Sand is said to splash if hit sufficiently hard (see dry quicksand) and sometimes the impact of a meteorite is referred to as splashing, if small bits of ejecta are formed. Physicist Lei Xu and coworkers at the University of Chicago discovered that the splash due to the impact of a small drop of ethanol onto a dry solid surface could be suppressed by reducing the pressure below a specific threshold. For drops of diameter 3.4 mm falling through air, this pressure was about 20 kilopascals, or 0.2 atmosphere. Splash plate A plate made of a hard material on which a stream of liquid is designed to fall is called a \\"splash plate\\". It may serve to protect the ground from erosion by falling water, such as beneath an artificial waterfall or water outlet in soft ground. Splash plates are also part of spray nozzles, such as in irrigation sprinkler systems.

He joined Turner's Kings of Rhythm in 1958, and remained with the band when the Ike & Tina Turner Revue was formed in 1960. During that eight years he spent with Turner, Thomas released solo singles on Sue, Sputnik, and Sonja Records. After his departure from Turner, Thomas continued recording as a solo artist, eventually relocating to London. He formed his own label, Osceola Records, in 1979.  Life and career  = Early life = Thomas was born in Osceola, Arkansas on January 20, 1939. Raised by his aunt and uncle, Thomas grew up listening to blues musicians such as Big Maceo, Tampa Red, Walter Davis, and Sonny Boy Williamson. In his teens, Thomas formed his first band called the Rock and Roll Trays. They performed popular R&B; and blues tunes in clubs around Osceola. In 1958, Albert King recommended that Thomas travel to East St. Louis and audition for a spot as a vocalist in Ike Turner's band the Kings of Rhythm. = Kings of Rhythm = By 1956, Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm were one of the most popular live attractions in the St. Louis and East St. Louis club scene. In 1958, Turner was looking for a new vocalist following the departure of Clayton Love. Thomas replaced Love and was soon joined by singer Tommy Hodge. Around the time Thomas and Hodge joined the Kings of Rhythm, Turner shifted from his usual blues oriented sound to producing R&B; material. That year, Thomas made his recording debut during the group's Cobra Records sessions in Chicago. He was featured on Turner's singles released on Stevens Records in 1959. In St. Louis, Thomas also performed with Benny Sharp, Eugene Neal, and Albert King. = Ike and Tina Turner Revue = In 1960, Turner wrote \\"A Fool in Love\\" for Art Lassiter. When Lassiter failed to show up for the recording session, one of Turner's background vocalist, Little Ann, sang the lead. Little Ann was renamed Tina Turner, and the single was released on Sue Records. Following the success of the single, Turner formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue which included the Kings of Rhythm and a trio of female vocalist called the Ikettes. In 1961, Thomas and Ikette Wilhelmina Weaver (as Jimmy & Jean) released the single \\"I Can't Believe\\" / \\"I Want Marry You\\" on Sue. After Ike & Tina had a string of hit records, Turner relocated the band to Los Angeles in 1962. When the hits dried up they began to tour vigorously. Thomas recalled, \\"We would only be in L.A. three months out of the year, we be touring like nine months.\\" Since they couldn't rely on records, the revue strengthened their live act by added dance routines. Thomas and Tina Turner would change the routines and have dance battles onstage. In 1962, Thomas released his single \\"You Can Go\\"/\\"Hurry And Come Home\\" on Sue Records. In between touring, Turner formed multiple record labels to release singles. Thomas released solo singles on Turner's labels Sputnik and Sonja. In 1964, the revue released their first live album, Ike & Tina Turner Revue Live, which features Thomas' rendition of \\"Feel So Good\\" by Junior Parker. His rendition of \\"Down In The Valley\\" is included on the revue's follow-up live album, Live! The Ike & Tina Turner Show, released in 1965. = Solo career = While the Ike & Tina Turner Revue were touring the UK with the Rolling Stones in 1966, Thomas befriended producers Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti, who invited him to learn production. Thomas left Ike & Tina in 1966, working local jobs in Los Angeles and recording for Mirwoods Records. on the Mirwood label he released the single \\"Where There's a Will (There's a Way)\\" in 1966. In 1969, he relocated to London and began producing his own solo records such as the Northern soul classic \\"The Beautiful Night\\" released on Parlophone in 1969. In 1973, He wrote and produced a solo LP, Abyss, released on Contempo, a London label owned by John Abbey, founder of Blues and Soul magazine. Thomas formed his own label, Osceola Records, in 1979. Beginning in the 1970s, Thomas provided background vocals for various acts, including Gary Wright, David Essex, Voyage, Mikael Rickfors, Lloyd Cole & The Commotions, Madness, Miguel Bos√©, Blue Mercedes, and Kevin Rowland.

The pink areas are the areas that are not always agreed upon by scholars containing Essex and Cambridgeshire. East Anglian English is a dialect of English spoken in East Anglia. East Anglian English has had a very considerable input into the formation of Standard English, and probably contributed to the development of American English; it has also experienced multilingualism on a remarkable scale. However, it has received little attention from the media and is not easily recognized by people from other parts of the UK. East Anglia is not easily defined as its boundaries are not uniformly agreed upon. Dialects commonly agreed upon include: * Norfolk dialect (Broad Norfolk) * Suffolk dialect Other dialects more loosely associated with East Anglia include: * Essex dialect * Cambridgeshire dialect * Fenland dialect  History  In Jacek Fisiak's and Peter Trudgill's book, East Anglian English, they describe the important influence East Anglian English has had on the development of the English language. In addition to its influence in the Standard English that is known today all around England, it also influenced General American English. There is evidence according to Oxford Dictionary that East Anglian English grammar was heard in North Carolina. Very little is known about the Anglo-Saxon East Anglian dialect; a Suffolk charter (of √Üthelfl√¶d, before 991) is included in . The author set out to record elements of the East Anglian dialect and records a statement made by a local when she caught him making notes on the sleeve of his shirt: \\"Whatever you bin makin' them little owd squiggles on y'r cuff fower?\\" Bensusan replied that he was \\"writing history\\". He then recorded her retort: \\"You dedn't wanter done that. Telly f'r why. When you've got y'r shirt washed there won't be nawthen left. I've never wrote nawthen all me born days, ne yet me husban', an he got all his teeth an' I kin thread me needle without spectacles. Folk don't wanter write in this world, they wanter do a job o' work.\\"  Accent  = Grammar = * Third-person singular zero is the lack of -s in third-person verb conjugations and is considered as the \\"best-known dialect feature\\" of East Anglian English. Examples include \\"she go\\" or \\"that say\\". * Use of the word do with the meaning of or, or else , for example \\"You better go to bed now, do you‚Äôll be tired in the morning\\" * That is used in place of central pronoun it, e.g. \\"that's cloudy\\", \\"that's hot out there\\" and \\"that book, that's okay, I like it\\". The final example still uses it, but only when it is the object of a verb. * Time is used to mean while, for example, \\"You sit down, time I get dinner ready.\\" * Now can also mean just, i.e. \\"I am now leaving\\" also means \\"I am just leaving\\". = Vocabulary = * bishybarnybee ‚Äî a ladybird * dag ‚Äî dew * dene ‚Äî the sandy area by the coast * dickey ‚Äî the local term to refer to a donkey * dodman ‚Äî a term used to refer to a snail * dow ‚Äî a pigeon * dwile ‚Äî floorcloth * gays ‚Äî the pictures printed on a book or a newspaper * grup ‚Äî refers to a small trench * hutkin ‚Äî used for a finger protecter * mawkin ‚Äî a scarecrow * mawther ‚Äî local word referring to a girl or young woman * pit ‚Äî a pond * push ‚Äî a boil or pimple * quant ‚Äî punt pole * ranny ‚Äî term meaning 'shrew' * sowpig ‚Äî a woodlouse * staithe ‚Äî an archaic term still used to reference any landing stage * stroop ‚Äî the throat = Phonology = Phonological features frequently heard throughout the area include: * Absence of h-dropping. * as in first pronounced . * as in stone * // is a very front vowel unlike London English, where it is a back vowel * in intervocalic positions are glottalized as in paper or baker, . This is also the case with , later , but is more commonly completely replaced by a full stop, i.e. . In addition to the above phonological features, East Anglian English also has a distinct rhythm.

H. Ritchie; 1929 He was forced from his position due to claims of homosexual practices, which had been outlawed under the Buggery Act 1533. Early life The third son of Robert Jocelyn, first Earl of Roden, whose family estates were in Castlewellan, County Down, by his wife Lady Anne Hamilton. He graduated with a BA from Trinity College Dublin. At Trinity, he was regarded as something of a bookworm, spending much of his time in his rooms on Library Square. He was later described as \\"a tall thin young man with a pale, meagre and melancholy countenance, and so reserved in his manners and recluse in his habits that he was considered by every body to be both proud and unsociable\\".Brian Lacey, Terrible Queer Creatures: Homosexuality in Irish History, Wordwell Books, Dublin, 2008. He was rector of Tamlaght, archdeacon of Ross (1788-1790), treasurer of Armagh (1790-1809), a prebend of Lismore (1796-1809), and bishop of Ferns and Leighlin (1809-1820) before becoming bishop of Clogher. 1811 Scandal In 1811, James Byrne (who had been a coachman for Jocelyn's brother, John) accused him of \\"taking indecent familiarities\\" and of \\"using indecent or obscene conversations with him\\". Byrne was sued for criminal libel by Jocelyn and on conviction was sentenced to two years in gaol and also to public flogging. After he recanted his allegations at the prompting of the bishop's agent, the floggings were stopped. 1822 Scandal The Bishop of Clogher; caricature by George CruikshankOn 19 July 1822, Percy Jocelyn was caught in a compromising position with a Grenadier Guardsman, John Moverley, in the back room of The White Lion public house, St Albans Place, off The Haymarket, Westminster. He and Moverley were released on bail, provided by the Earl of Roden and others. Jocelyn broke bail and moved to Scotland where he worked as a butler under an assumed name. He was declared deposed in his absence by the Metropolitan Court of Armagh in October 1822 for \\"the crimes of immorality, incontinence, Sodomitical practices, habits, and propensities, and neglect of his spiritual, judicial, and ministerial duties\\". A public subscription was raised to raise money for James Byrne, whose 1811 conviction was now recognised as a miscarriage of justice. Jocelyn was the most senior British churchman to be involved in a public homosexual scandal in the 19th century. It became a subject of satire and popular ribaldry, resulting in more than a dozen illustrated satirical cartoons, pamphlets, and limericks, such as: :The Devil to prove the Church was a farce :Went out to fish for a Bugger. :He baited his hook with a Soldier's arse :And pulled up the Bishop of Clogher. The scandal was so great, that in the days following, \\"it was not safe for a bishop to show himself in the streets of London\\", according to Charles Manners-Sutton, Archbishop of Canterbury at the time. In August 1822, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, who was both the Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons, had an audience with King George IV where he said that he was being blackmailed, and that \\"I am accused of the same crime as the Bishop of Clogher.\\" He committed suicide shortly afterwards, and was thought to have been in a paranoid state at the time. Legacy After Jocelyn's death, it was reported that he had been living quietly for four years at Salisbury Place, Edinburgh, under the assumed name Thomas Wilson. And had previously lived in Glasgow. The plate on his coffin carried no inscription except (in Latin): \\"Here lie the remains of a great sinner, saved by grace, whose hopes rest in the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.\\" However, some years ago the Jocelyn family vault in Kilcoo Parish Church in Bryansford, County Down, Northern Ireland was opened and it was discovered that it contained one more coffin than the number of grave markers indicated, and that the extra coffin was unmarked. This extra coffin may be that of the Bishop of Clogher. For 178 years after the scandal, the Church of Ireland refused to let historians see its papers on the affair. In the 1920s, Archbishop D'Arcy of Armagh ordered that they be burned, but this order was not obeyed. The files were released for Matthew Parris's research for his book The Great Unfrocked.

Although the design differs according to the type of work, the basic configuration is similar in all cases: a rotating crane body is mounted on a sturdy chassis fitted with flanged wheels. The body supports the jib (UK; North America: boom) and provides all the lifting and operating mechanisms; on larger cranes, an operator's cabin is usually provided. The chassis is fitted with buffing (UK) and/or coupling gear to allow the crane to be moved by a locomotive, although many are also self-propelled to allow limited movement about a work site. For cranes with a jib that extends beyond the length of the chassis, an idler car (also known as a 'jib carrier' (UK) or 'boom car' (North America)) is provided to protect the jib and to allow the crane to be coupled within a train. The idler car is usually a long, flat wagon (i.e. a flatcar) that provides a means of securing the jib for transportation; storage areas for special equipment or supplies are usually fitted too. It was not uncommon for the idler car to be built on a withdrawn revenue-earning wagon. Usage Railroad cranes are usually designed specifically for one of three purposes: =Goods yard cranes= Usually the smallest of the railroad cranes, goods yard cranes were used in the larger goods yards to provide lifting capability in areas away from the ground-mounted goods cranes normally provided in such yards. They were often small enough to be operated by hand, and were not normally self-propelled, instead requiring the use of a shunting engine to move them into position. Once cheap road-going mobile cranes were available, these superseded the rail-mounted variety due to their greater flexibility and mobility. =Maintenance cranes= The most varied forms of crane are used for maintenance work. General purpose cranes may be used for installing signalling equipment or pointwork, for example, while more specialised types are used for track laying. =Breakdown cranes= The largest cranes are used for accident recovery work, usually forming part of a breakdown train that includes staff accommodation and recovery equipment. These are large enough to lift derailed rolling stock back onto the track, although two or more cranes may be required to safely recover a locomotive.Peter Tatlow, Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 1, Noodle Books, 2012, Peter Tatlow, Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 2, Noodle Books, 2013, In North American terminology, a 'breakdown crane' is often referred to as a 'wrecker' and the train of which it is a part is referred to as a 'wreck train'. The members of the crew that recovers the wrecked car(s) or locomotive(s) are referred to as 'wreckers'. Construction A railroad crane generally resembles a conventional fixed- location crane except that the platform the crane sits on is a heavy-duty reinforced flat car. Directly underneath the center of gravity for the crane is a pivot point that allows the crane to swivel around 360¬∞; in this way the crane can locate its boom over the worksite no matter what its location is along the track. The trucks on the car under the crane will often include traction motors so that the crane is able to move itself along the track, and possibly tow additional cars. Larger cranes may be provided with outriggers to provide additional stability when lifting. Sleepers (ties) are often carried on the idler car to put under the outriggers to spread the weight applied to the trackbed. Breakdown cranes (sometimes called wrecking cranes or 'big hooks') were necessary to every railroad to recover derailed rolling stock and locomotives, while also assisting with bridge building and yard construction. History In the early days of the railways, locomotives and rolling stock were small enough to be re-railed manually using jacks and tackle, but as they became bigger and heavier this method became inadequate. A derailed steam locomotive being lifted back onto the tracks by a rail mounted crane in 1951 Enter into this the steam crane and cable winch. Appearing about 1890, the cranes (the proper rail terminology is ‚ÄúDerrick‚Äù) increased in size, commensurate with the rise of steel Pullman cars, so by 1910 steam cranes reached their peak of development (on the railroad). Many of these 1910-era cranes were so useful and powerful, that they remained in service until the 1980s. The combination of a quick-firing steam boiler, heavy steam winch, and cable hook could little be improved upon, and thus remained in service. Also, steam engines did not mind being parked for months, with a little care, and were ready to go to work when needed. In the 1980s, big, hydraulic controlled diesel cranes appeared. Also, these cranes had the ability to travel on the highway so as to better able to get to the scene of an accident. They are much more mobile, and are able to manoeuvre around an accident scene, better than a crane only limited to rail access. In the United States the advent of contractors to cleanup and re-rail a line to productive status came in around the late 1970s and early 1980s. The use of caterpillar tractor mounted sidebooms (pipelayers) enabled the contractors to mobilize around a site without having the need for crane mats and multiple lifting locations. In the 1990s a new generation of railway cranes was developed. While the conventional diesel hydraulic road cranes were adopted with some small trolleys to move on the rail track, the new generation had a professional high speed railway chassis for up to . The superstructure is also diesel hydraulic with telescopic boom and counterweight and designed to the railway's specific needs. These cranes can travel with suspended loads and keep levelled even on an elevated track, due to the automatic cant compensation. It is possible to work on one outrigger only, work with boom in horizontal position under bridges or under the overhead wires. Capacities are as high as 200 tonnes. It makes this new generation useful for maintenance work and switch and crossing renewal, as well as recovery work.

Although not normally required for re-railing activities, they are exceptionally useful for track relaying and the restoration of locomotives and rolling stock, and help to avoid expenditure on outside contractors. Three cranes of various sizes are preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California. They are all cranes once owned by the Western Pacific Railroad and two of them, a small, self-propelled Burro Crane and a large, 200-ton capacity Industrial Brownhoist crane, are maintained in operable condition.

Early life Steve was born on August 29, 1956 in Elgin as one of six children to John and Shirley Rauschenberger. He attended Elgin Area School District U46 public schools and was a National Merit Finalist in high school. In 1978, he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from College of William & Mary in Virginia. In 1980, he purchased his family's business, Rauschenberger Furniture Co., and went on to buy Ackemann Brothers Corp. in 1985, of which he is currently president and general manager. He became active with his children in Boy Scouts and served as a member of the Elgin Downtown Advisory Commission. Illinois Senate =1992 Election= In 1991, Republican Senator John Friedland chose not to run for re-election in the 33rd district. At that time, the 33rd included Streamwood and Bartlett in Cook County, Elgin, South Elgin, West Dundee, East Dundee, Carpentersville, Maple Park, Hampshire, Burlington, Sugar Grove and Campton Township in Kane County and Hinckley in DeKalb County. Rauschenberger ran for the seat, citing a change in the tax code that cost retailers millions by forcing them to change their accounting practices. In an upset, Rauschenberger defeated State Representative James Kirkland in the March primary. In May, businessman and lawyer Thom McNamee became the Democratic nominee. Rauschenberger ran on a platform of privatization of government services, opposition to tax hikes, an increase in earned income tax credits, opposition to the proposed Fox Valley Freeway and restoring the state's financial health. =Tenure= During his early years in the Senate, he was a member of a group dubbed the \\"Fab Five.\\" The group was made up of conservative state senators elected in 1992 who were anti-tax, pro-balanced budget and often challenged the Republican leadership of Senate President Pate Philip and Governor Jim Edgar. The group's other four members were, Peter Fitzgerald, Dave Syverson, Patrick O'Malley and Chris Lauzen. As a result of the group's clout Rauschenberger became chair of the influential Appropriations Committee during his first term. As Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Rauschenberger negotiated the multibillion-dollar state budget. He also served as the Senate negotiator for KidCare, the state health insurance program for children in low-income, working families. During the 2001 redistricting process, Rauschenberger was drawn into the 22nd legislative district which included much of his old territory in Elgin, Dundee and Hanover townships and added Schaumburg Township. He won re-election in the new district with 56% of the vote.http://elections.il.gov/ElectionResultsStateSenate.aspx?ID=13 In 2003, when the Democratic Party took a majority in the Illinois Senate, he lost his chairmanship of the appropriations committee, but was appointed to be an Assistant Republican Leader under Frank Watson. He also served as Minority Spokesman on the Joint Task Force on Immigrants and Refugeeshttp://www.ilga.gov/senate/committees/members.asp?CommitteeID=136&GA;=93 In the Senate, Rauschenberger's legislative agenda including supporting statewide tax caps, increasing the income tax exemption, enacting \\"pro-life\\" policies and balancing the budget. He also received high ratings from the Illinois Federation of Independent Business during his tenure.https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/6282/steven- rauschenberger#.VfYvWxFViko During his time in the Illinois Senate, Rauschenberger was active with the National Conference of State Legislatures including serving as co-chair of the Taskforce on Telecommunications and Electronic Commerce, an executive board member and Vice President. In 2006, he was elected President of the NCSL. He was also active in the Republican Party serving as the Hanover Township Republican Committeeman from 1994-2002 and as President of the John Ericsson Republican League, a Swedish American Republican organization. Runs for Higher Office =United States Senate election, 2004= In May 2003, Jim Edgar announced that he would not seek the US Senate seat being vacated by retiring US Senator Peter Fitzgerald. Rauschenberger was one of the many people speculated who could run for the seat. On September 23, 2003, Rauschenberger announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Despite being heavily out matched in fundraising, he rode a late surge fueled by sweeping editorial endorsements, including the Chicago Tribune to finish third in the March 16, 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate Republican primary election that was won by Jack Ryan.http://elections.il.gov/ElectionResults.aspx?ID=15 During the general election, Jack Ryan dropped out of the race after revelations regarding his divorce. Subsequently Rauschenberger became a front-runner to replace Ryan as the Republican nominee in Senate race against then-State Senator Barack Obama, including being promoted by Don Manzullo. Rauschenberger announced on July 8, 2004 that he would not seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate‚Äîin part because he was never convinced he would have the financial support needed to wage a competitive campaign against Barack Obama who had announced two days earlier having raised $4 million in the second quarter of 2004. His withdraw was followed by speculation about a potential Mike Ditka candidacy. =Illinois gubernatorial election, 2006= In August 2005, Senator Rauchenberger sought the Republican nomination Governor of Illinois in the 2006 election. However, citing a crowded field, Rauchenberger dropped out of the race for governor and joined Rod Gidwitz's campaign as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Though the two positions are nominated in the primary independently, candidates for both often run together during the primary campaign, promoting a single \\"ticket.\\" During the race, he vowed to drop out if Judy Baar Topinka won the nomination. He ultimately lost to Topinka's running mate and DuPage County States Attorney Joe Birkett. Post political career After leaving the Senate in 2007, he founded Rauschenberger Partners, a lobbying firm where he serves as President. He also took on the role of President of the United Republican Fund until his resignation in 2010. In 2008, he ran to become the Republican National Committeeman representing Illinois, but lost to Pat Brady at the 2008 State Convention of the Illinois Republican Party. During the 2010 election cycle Rauschenberger chose to run against Mike Noland, his successor as state senator and the Democratic incumbent. He was endorsed by Illinois Citizens for Ethics, Illinois Family Action, Illinois Federation of Independent Business, National Rifle Association, the Chicago Tribune and the United Republican Fund of which he was President. On election night, Noland defeated Rauschenberger by 585 votes. In May 2015, Rauschenberger became President of the Technology & Manufacturing Association, a nonprofit organization that represents precision manufacturing and supplier companies in Illinois.

First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers. Anti- predator adaptations are mechanisms developed through evolution that assist prey organisms in their constant struggle against predators. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught. The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, masquerade, apostatic selection, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual. Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape. Avoiding detection =Staying out of sight= Fruit bats forage by night to avoid predators. Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands. Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Camouflage illustrated by the flat-tail horned lizard, its flattened, fringed and disruptively patterned body eliminating shadow =Camouflage= Camouflage uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination by countershading or counter- illumination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground. =Masquerade= Kallima inachus masquerading as a dead leaf Animals can hide in plain sight by masquerading as inedible objects. For example, the potoo, a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch, while a butterfly, Kallima, looks just like a dead leaf. =Apostatic selection= Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as tits selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming search images of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative frequency-dependent selection, apostatic selection. Warding off attack A Mediterranean mantis, Iris oratoria, attempting to startle a predator with deimatic behaviour Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators. =Startling the predator= Many weakly- defended animals, including moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and cephalopods such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals. =Pursuit-deterrent signals= An impala stotting, signalling honestly to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, gazelles stot, jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them. White- tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Warning calls given by birds such as the Eurasian jay are similarly honest signals, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack. =Playing dead= Eastern hog-nosed snake playing dead Another pursuit-deterrent signal is thanatosis or playing dead. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching. An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as \\"alarm bradycardia\\", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the \\"dead\\" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest. =Distraction= A killdeer plover, distracting a predator from its nest by feigning a broken wing Marine molluscs such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud. Distraction displays attract the attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected. Distraction displays are performed by some species of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground, and by some species of fish. =Mimicry and aposematism= Viceroy and monarch are M√ºllerian mimics, similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators. Mimicry occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and M√ºllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator. In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, harmless prey species mimics the appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colours and markings, including Batesian mimics, which are in effect parasitic on the chemical or other defences of the unprofitable models. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea- snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model. In M√ºllerian mimicry, two or more aposematic forms share the same warning signals, as in viceroy and monarch butterflies. Birds avoid eating both species because their wing patterns honestly signal their unpleasant taste. The porcupine Erethizon dorsatum combines sharp spines with warning coloration =Defensive structures= Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most molluscs), leathery or scaly skin (as in reptiles), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in arthropods). A spine is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability;Thomas, Craig. Scott, Susan. (1997). All Stings Considered. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 96-97. predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker. Stinging Limacodidae slug moth caterpillars Many species of slug caterpillar, Limacodidae, have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces. Species that possess these stinging spines suffer less predation than larvae that lack them, and a predator, the paper wasp, chooses larvae without spines when given a choice. Safety in numbers Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways, as described below. =Dilution effect= A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. In a group, prey seek central positions in order to reduce their domain of danger. Individuals along the outer edges of the group are more at risk of being targeted by the predator. =Selfish herd= The selfish herd theory was proposed by W.D. Hamilton to explain why animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack. =Predator satiation= periodical cicada: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to satiate predators. A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life- cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey. Vervet monkeys have different alarm signals that warn of attacks by eagles, leopards and snakes. =Alarm calls= Animals that live in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a \\"chutter\\". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses. =Improved vigilance= northern harrier, chases up an alert flock of American avocets. In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases. A single zebra is hard to catch amongst a herd. =Predator confusion= Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Fighting back Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism. =Chemical defences= The bloody-nose beetle, Timarcha tenebricosa, exuding a drop of noxious red liquid (upper right) Many prey animals, and to defend against seed predation also seeds of plants, make use of poisonous chemicals for self- defence. These may be concentrated in surface structures such as spines or glands, giving an attacker a taste of the chemicals before it actually bites or swallows the prey animal: many toxins are bitter-tasting. A last-ditch defence is for the animal's flesh itself to be toxic, as in the puffer fish, danaid butterflies and burnet moths. Many insects acquire toxins from their food plants; Danaus caterpillars accumulate toxic cardenolides from milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae). Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively. The bombardier beetle has specialized glands on the tip of its abdomen that allows it to direct a toxic spray towards predators. The spray is generated explosively through oxidation of hydroquinones and is sprayed at a temperature of 100 ¬∞C. Armoured crickets similarly release blood at their joints when threatened (autohaemorrhaging).\\"See It to Believe It: Animals Vomit, Spurt Blood to Thwart Predators\\", Allison Bond, Discover Magazine blog, 28 July 2009, retrieved 17 March 2010 Several species of grasshopper including Poecilocerus pictus, Parasanaa donovani, Aularches miliaris, and Tegra novaehollandiae secrete noxious liquids when threatened, sometimes ejecting these forcefully. Spitting cobras accurately squirt venom from their fangs at the eyes of potential predators, striking their target eight times out of ten, and causing severe pain. Termite soldiers in the Nasutitermitinae have a fontanellar gun, a gland on the front of their head which can secrete and shoot an accurate jet of resinous terpenes \\"many centimeters\\". The material is sticky and toxic to other insects. One of the terpenes in the secretion, pinene, functions as an alarm pheromone. Seeds deter predation with combinations of toxic non-protein amino acids, cyanogenic glycosides, protease and amylase inhibitors, and phytohemaglutinins. A few vertebrate species such as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey. The slime glands along the body of the hagfish secrete enormous amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey. =Communal defence= Group of muskoxen in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels. =Defensive regurgitation= A northern fulmar chick protects itself with a jet of stomach oil. Some birds and insects use defensive regurgitation to ward off predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading to the loss of flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food. European roller chicks vomit a bright orange, foul smelling liquid when they sense danger. This repels prospective predators and may alert their parents to danger: they respond by delaying their return. Numerous insects utilize defensive regurgitation. The eastern tent caterpillar regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help to deter predator attacks. =Suicidal altruism= An unusual type of predator deterrence is observed in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation and serve as a signal to other enemy ants to stop predation of the rest of the colony. Escaping Startled pheasants and partridges fly from possible danger. =Flight= The normal reaction of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, according to the animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, making it difficult for the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck. =Autotomy= Lizard tail autotomy can distract predators, continuing to writhe while the lizard makes its escape. Some animals are capable of autotomy (self-amputation), shedding one of their own appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows. History of observations Aristotle recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of cephalopods in his History of Animals, including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling. In 1940, Hugh Cott wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, Adaptive Coloration in Animals. By the 21st century, adaptation to life in cities had markedly reduced the antipredator responses of animals such as rats and pigeons; similar changes are observed in captive and domesticated animals.

Plot In a charming Connecticut village, Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) are in marriage counseling on Christmas Eve; the session does not go well and their problems become evident. Caroline has had an affair, and Lloyd is miserable and blames the problems with their 14-year- old son, Jesse (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.), on his wife. (She coddles and protects him and thinks he does no wrong, while he continues to treat him like the criminal he turns out to really be.) The marriage counselor Dr. Wong (B.D. Wong), tries to get them to open up, but, behaving professionally, he refuses to intercede on either side. Meanwhile, a criminal named Gus (Denis Leary) is in the midst of stealing jewelry from a safe in a home he has broken into; however, he accidentally sets off the alarm, a trap door opens and he lands in the basement. Only after he is bitten on the leg by a guard dog is Gus able to escape the house, but his getaway car, driven by his bumbling, alcoholic partner Murray (Richard Bright), is no longer there. Then he runs into Lloyd and Caroline. Holding a gun on them, Gus orders the couple to drive him to their house. Along the way Caroline and Lloyd continue to argue, with Gus beginning to act as a referee and repeatedly telling them to shut up. At the house, Lloyd and Caroline continue to argue. Knowing full well that Murray will seek refuge at a seedy bar, Gus calls the bar and describes Murray to the bartender. He tells Murray to steal a boat for their getaway. Jesse comes home and discovers his parents tied up. Jesse is unhappy, forced to attend military school, and has been blackmailing a commanding officer there named Siskel (J.K. Simmons) with photographs of an affair, and is also in possession of a baby Jesus from their town's nativity scene for unknown reasons (which is discovered by Gus when snooping around the house after Caroline denies Jesse had anything to do with it to him). He prefers Gus to his parents, but Gus, despite claiming earlier to Lloyd that his life as a criminal is more meaningful than Lloyd's seemingly pampered life is, explains to Jesse that his life isn't all as great as he thinks it might be. Meanwhile, police set up roadblocks and set a curfew to help look for Gus, while two inept officers go door to door. Lt. Huff, the chief at the local precinct is less than concerned over it because nothing like this ever happens there. However, Huff does obtain video footage of Gus in action, but while taking a call, his bumbling officers accidentally record over the footage trying to change the channel back to the movie they were watching; It's a Wonderful Life. Due to this and his lax attitude over the whole thing, he is later informed by Bob, a councilman, that his officers are to report to him and that he is fired the day after Christmas. However, his joy is crushed when Lt. Huff informs him that he slept with his wife once while out of town, and was a better lover than he was. Another side story is a neighbor dressed as Santa named George. He comes by to deliver a fruitcake to the Chasseurs, then goes off to a Christmas party to hand out gifts, but eventually gets belligerent with the kids and winds up so drunk he is kicked out of the party. Lloyd's family is en route for the holidays. It includes his brother Gary (Adam LeFevre), sister- in-law Connie (Christine Baranski), their two children Mary and John (Ellie Raab and Phillip Nicoll), and Lloyd‚Äôs mother Rose (Glynis Johns), who is extremely wealthy and bullies everyone in the family. Gus pretends to be Lloyd's and Caroline's marriage counselor, Dr. Wong, since he cannot hold everyone hostage. Jesse is tied up and gagged upstairs in his parents' closet. Caroline and Lloyd are unable to stop fighting, and Caroline demands a divorce. Gus' pointed comments goad Lloyd to finally find the guts to stand up to his wife and his mother. Everyone finds out who Gus really is after Rose attempts to go upstairs; Gus puts a gun to her head and Connie, fed up with everybody, says, \\"Shoot her.\\" Siskel turns up to reveal how he is being blackmailed. Jesse has managed to untie himself and is discovered with his hidden money. Then George, still dressed as Santa, returns, very drunk, wondering why he never gets a gift in return. He spots the gun, realizes who Gus is, then runs at him, only to get knocked out. The state police arrive and Lloyd, having a change of heart decides he cannot \\"spend his life sending everyone he cares about to prison\\" and tells Jesse to take Gus to the docks using a path through the woods. Gus steals the Santa suit and makes it safely to the boat. He escapes, arguing with Murray much the same way he argued all night with Caroline and Lloyd. Back at home, the couple's bickering even drives away the police. Having aired out their differences throughout the evening with their armed robber's assistance, they make up and decide to stay together and kiss. Their reconciliation is interrupted when John informs them that \\"grandma Rose is eating through her gag.\\" Cast * Denis Leary as Gus * Judy Davis as Caroline * Kevin Spacey as Lloyd * Robert J.

It was inspired by their families. For example, the dinner scene: \\"Both Marie and I are Italian Catholics who married into Jewish families, so we do have those big holiday dinners,\\" LaGravenese said. Weiss began writing the script in 1989 after she and her husband moved from New York to California. Inspiration came from an argument she had with him and she thought, \\"Wouldn't it be great if there were a third party to step in and referee?\\" She wrote several drafts and consulted with LaGravenese in 1991 and they took it to Disney. The studio approved the project within 20 minutes. LaGravenese spent a year revising the script until he finally got \\"tired of doing rewrites for executives.\\" After Ted Demme directed comedian Denis Leary in No Cure for Cancer, a stand-up comedy special for Showtime, they got the script for The Ref and decided to do it. The studio cast Leary based on the sarcastic funny man persona he cultivated in MTV spots that Demme directed. Leary joined the project as part of a three picture deal with Disney. Their involvement motivated LaGravenese to come back to the project. Executive producer Don Simpson described the overall tone of The Ref as \\"biting and sarcastic. Just my nature.\\" After test audiences responded poorly to the film's original ending‚ÄîGus turns himself in to show Jesse that a life of crime leads nowhere quickly‚Äîa new ending was shot in January 1994. Reception The Ref did not perform as well at the box office as Leary would have liked and he blamed the studio's method of marketing it: \\"They did me like the MTV guy. And they shortchanged what the movie was all about.\\" The film grossed a total of only $11,439,193 at the domestic box office, after coming in at #4 opening weekend behind Guarding Tess, Lightning Jack and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Leary made fun of himself in a humorous article written for a 1994 issue of Playboy where he is interviewing Pope John Paul II: Leary asks the Pope if he has seen The Ref, and the Pope responds that he was told it was very vulgar, as evident by its unpopularity. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating of 72% based on reviews from 54 critics, with an average rating of 6.45/10. The site's consensus is: \\"Undeniably uneven and too dark for some, The Ref nonetheless boasts strong turns from Denis Leary, Judy Davis, and Kevin Spacey, as well as a sharply funny script.\\" Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars. He wrote, \\"Material like this is only as good as the acting and writing. The Ref is skillful in both areas.\\" Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers praised the performances of Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis: \\"They are combustibly funny, finding nuance even in nonsense.

Born in Wrexham, his family moved to England when he was young. Before professionalism, he was a police officer with the Leicestershire Constabulary's armed response unit. He made his debut at Leicester Tigers and played for them as a flanker but a move to Nottingham in 1991 saw him convert to hooker. He rejected the offer of a trial for Wales. He moved back to Leicester in 1996 where he became an understudy to Richard Cockerill. His form improved and he was noticed by England coach Clive Woodward during matches when Cockerill was away on international duty. This resulted in him being picked on the England bench for the 1998 match against France, coming on to replace Cockerill. The next week Cockerill was injured, but second-choice Mark Regan who had been injured for the match against France was fit again, so West was again selected on the bench, and came onto win his second cap. Cockerill's loss of form would see West gradually replace him as first-choice hooker at Leicester, and West had another run of caps in the England starting line-up in 2001. He played in the 2001 Six Nations, and was selected for the England tour to Canada and the US, where he added 3 caps. After the end of the tour he was called up whilst on holiday as a replacement for the British & Irish Lions and performed so well he was on the bench for the final two tests. He failed to keep his shirt to Northampton Saints' hooker Steve Thompson, but was a useful squad member. At Leicester West enjoyed great domestic success, and started both the 2001 and 2002 Heineken Cup finals. West was captain of England for the world cup warm-up game against France in Marseilles in August. During the Rugby World Cup, West was included in the 22 man squad for five of the games, playing in two; starting against Uruguay and coming on as a replacement for the semi-final against France. He was also on the bench for the final, and since his return has been awarded an MBE in the New Year's Honours. He announced his retirement from international rugby after the end of the 2003 World Cup and turned to coaching becoming forward coach for the England U21s. On 8 June 2007, it was announced he had signed as forwards coach to recently relegated Northampton Saints alongside former England Saxons head coach, Jim Mallinder.

Macdonald Bridge on Canada Day The Angus L. Macdonald Bridge is a suspension bridge crossing Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada; it opened on April 2, 1955. The bridge is one of two suspension bridges linking the Halifax Peninsula to Dartmouth in the Halifax Regional Municipality. It is named after the former premier of Nova Scotia, Angus L. Macdonald, who had died in 1954 and had been instrumental in having the bridge built. The bridge was designed by Philip Louis Pratley, one of Canada's foremost long-span bridge designers who had also been responsible for the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver. The bridges have a similar design, which is most notable in the towers. The contractor was Dominion Bridge Company Ltd. The bridge regularly experiences traffic congestion during rush hours as a result of the structure's proximity to the downtown cores of Halifax and Dartmouth, as well as its narrow width. Large commercial vehicles are not permitted to cross and must use the wider MacKay Bridge to the northwest. Public transit buses are allowed to cross and the bridge links several Halifax Transit routes. In 2014/15 the average number of vehicle crossings per month was 1,183,095. As of 2015 the toll charge to cross for regular passenger vehicles is $1.00 cash or $0.80 with the MACPASS electronic toll system (60¬¢ tokens were once used but are no longer accepted as of May 1, 2008). The original toll, when the Macdonald opened in 1955, was 40 cents plus 5 cents per passenger. There was also a separate toll for trucks, cyclists, pedestrians, motorcycles and horses/rider. History Construction of the bridge took place between 1952 and 1955. Caissons were used for underwater work. Five workers died falling from catwalks during construction. The bridge opened on April 2, 1955, and originally cost $11.5 million. 1999 modernization A modernization project was undertaken in the late 1990s and completed in 1999 which saw the original two lanes and one sidewalk and utility corridor expanded to three lanes, with the centre lane being reversible to assist with traffic flow during peak periods. To reduce the weight of the roadway, asphalt and concrete were removed and special steel plating (an orthotropic deck) was used in its place. This deck is 35% lighter than the old one. New pedestrian and bicycle lanes were attached to the outside of the structure to replace the original sidewalks. External aesthetic lights were added during the modernisation project which saw the bridge's towers lit for the first time on a continuous basis every evening from sunset until midnight. Critics derided the effort as a waste of electricity, given Halifax Harbour's frequent foggy weather conditions. The lighting was estimated by the bridge authority to cost in excess of $50,000 a year in 1999. Safety barriers The Angus L. Macdonald Bridge has attracted media attention as the spot where well known environmental activist Tooker Gomberg is believed to have committed suicide on March 3, 2004. In June 2004 the Department of National Defence filed a lawsuit against the Bridge Commission alleging that snow, ice, bottles and other debris rained down on HMC Dockyard below, endangering staff. The DND first sought $527,000 in damages for its efforts to protect employees, an amount that was later increased to $1.04 million. The lawsuit claimed that the issue had been exacerbated when chain link fencing on the bridge had been removed during the 1999 modernization. In July 2007, as part of the settlement, barriers were installed along 22% of the pedestrian lane at the bridge's western end (Halifax abutment) to prevent suicide attempts and protect navy staff below. Initially, the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission was concerned that the structure was not capable of handling the additional weight of installing safety barriers along the entire span of the bridge. Subsequent computer modeling eliminated the previous concerns, and on May 13, 2009 the general manager and CEO of the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission, Steve Snider, announced that a tender for the long-called for extension of the barriers along the full length of the bridge would be issued in June 2009. By March 2010, the remaining sections of the safety barrier had been installed. The bridge now has safety barriers installed along 100% of its pedestrian walkways. 2015 \\"Big Lift\\" project Beginning in 2015 another major renovation of the bridge started which saw the temporary removal of the pedway and bike lanes. At a cost of $150 million, every piece of steel that makes up the suspended spans, except the towers and two main cables, were replaced; the non-suspended approach spans remained. New vertical cables were required due to the relocation of the stiffening trusses from above deck level to below deck level. Construction mostly occurred overnight with the bridge open to traffic during the day, but many full-weekend closures were necessary. The replacement portion of the project was completed in February 2017.Halifax Harbour Bridges, About The Big Lift, February 27, 2017. Retrieved July 13, 2017. After the Lion's Gate Bridge, this was only the second time that a suspension bridge had its suspended spans completely replaced while continuing to allow regular traffic flow during the daytime. Principal engineering work for the project was done by the same firm that managed the work on the Lion's Gate Bridge.Halifax Harbour Bridges \\"About The Big Lift\\", Retrieved on June 19, 2014 During the Big Lift project Halifax Transit continued to run its regularly scheduled conventional bus service across the Macdonald bridge, except during times when the bridge was closed. During scheduled closures, Halifax Transit operated a shuttle service using the MacKay Bridge. Halifax Bridges also operated a free, 24-hour-a-day shuttle service during construction to accommodate the bridge's pedestrian and bicycle users. It operated on a load-and-go basis during the weekday morning and afternoon rush hours, and on a 30-minute schedule at all other times of the day and overnight. See also * A.

Early years, education Nunn May was the youngest of four children of Walter Frederick Nunn May, a brassfounder, and Mary Annie, n√©e Kendall. He was born in Bedruthan, Park Hill, Moseley, Birmingham, and educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham.Cathcart, Brian. May, Alan Nunn (1911‚Äì2003). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography As a scholarship student at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he achieved a first in physics, which led to doctoral studies under Charles Ellis and lectureship at King's College London. Career =Early Communist ties= Nunn May joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in the 1930s, and was active in the Association of Scientific Workers. Cambridge Five spy ring member Donald Duart Maclean was also at Trinity Hall during an overlapping period. =World War II= During World War II, he initially worked on radar in Suffolk, then with Cecil Powell in Bristol on a project that attempted to use photographic methods to detect fast particles from radioactive decay. James Chadwick recruited him to a Cambridge University team working on a possible heavy water reactor. The team was part of the British Tube Alloys directorate which was merged into the American Manhattan Project, the successful effort to create a nuclear weapon. In January 1943 the Cambridge team including Nunn May transferred to the Montreal Laboratory which was building a reactor at Chalk River near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. His Canadian job ended in September 1945, and he returned to his lecturing post in London. =Soviet espionage= He had let his membership of the Communist Party lapse by 1940, but at Cambridge when he saw an American report mentioning that Germany might be able to build a dirty bomb, he passed this on to a Soviet contact. In Canada he was approached by Lieutenant Angelov of the GRU (Soviet military intelligence) for information on atomic research. He continued his espionage by secretly supplying small samples of the isotopes Uranium-233 and 235. The courier of these samples was not informed of the danger of radiation and developed painful lesions. He subsequently needed lifelong regular blood transfusions.Baggot, Jim (2009) Atomic: The First War of Physics, p. 379, Icon Books. May also borrowed library research documents on nuclear power, many from the USA, for copying. The Canadian Royal Commission which later investigated said he was paid with two bottles of whiskey and at least $700 (Canadian); Nunn May said he accepted the money under protest and promptly burnt it. Angelov gave him details for a rendezvous with the GRU next to the British Museum in London after his return. =Convicted of espionage= A GRU cipher clerk in Canada, Igor Gouzenko, defected to the West in Ottawa in September 1945; this was right around the time when Nunn May's Canadian assignment ended. Gouzenko passed along copies of GRU documents implicating Nunn May, including details of the proposed meeting in London. Nunn May did not go to the British Museum meeting, but he was arrested in March 1946. Nunn May confessed to espionage. On 1 May 1946, he was sentenced to ten years' hard labour. He was released in late 1952, after serving six and a half years. May refused to define his actions as treason, claiming in a statement after his release from prison that he believed he had \\"acted rightly\\" and had acted as a spy because of being \\"wholeheartedly concerned with securing victory over Nazi Germany and Japan, and the furtherance of the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.\\"\\"Did No Wrong, Nunn May Insists; Hopes to Serve 'Fellow Men'\\". The New York Times. 30 December 1952. Blacklisted from universities in Britain, Nunn May worked for a scientific instruments company, then in 1961 went to work at the University of Ghana, where he conducted research in solid-state physics and created a science museum. Personal life, death Nunn May's first name is sometimes spelled Allan with two L's, but the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica both use Alan.Alan Nunn May. Encyclopaedia Britannica In 1953, Nunn May married Hilde Broda, ex-wife of Engelbert Broda. They had a son, and a stepson from Hilde's previous marriage. He returned to Cambridge in 1978, and died there in a hospital on 12 January 2003. Cause of death was pneumonia and pulmonary disease. A 2002 statement released after his death stated that he had no regrets about his spying activities. It was passed to The Guardian newspaper in 2003 having been dictated to a relative in late 2002. Legacy Nunn May's arrest and sentence in 1946 first showed publicly that the Soviet Union had obtained atomic secrets by espionage. His clearance by MI5 also led to American distrust of Britain, and the McMahon Act. He passed on information on atomic reactors, but unlike Klaus Fuchs (who was arrested in 1950) he knew little of weapon design. Nunn May is a major character in the 2003 novel The Cloud Chamber, by Clare George, a fictional account of Cambridge physicists in the 1930s which centres on the scientific excitement of the interwar years contrasted with the vexing moral questions faced by scientists during World War II. The main character is a fictional physicist and pacifist who studied and worked at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory with Nunn May before the war. George's acknowledged inspiration for the story was her grandfather, a real-life physicist whose true story follows several of the particulars of her character, Walter Dunnachie.

Henderson. It is currently owned by Selfridges Group, through which it is affiliated with the European department stores Selfridges, Brown Thomas, and de Bijenkorf. The chain is comparable to the American department stores Barneys New York, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue.Eastwood, Alison. If the Shoe Fits. Marketing. June 25, 2007, page 18. Once \\"Furriers in Ordinary\\" to Queen Victoria, the chain was founded as a fur shop in Quebec City. Operations during 19th century =Early history= 35 Buade St., Qu√©bec City, housed one of the earliest store. In 1837, William S. Henderson, an Irish-born merchant, bought his partners' interest in their Quebec City fur shop and went into business for himself, thereby marking the traditional founding date of Holt Renfrew. Three years earlier, Henderson had arrived by ship from Londonderry with a load of hats and caps. The merchandise sold well and other overseas crossings followed. Eventually, Henderson set up shop at Quebec under the name William Ashton & Co. An early company advertisement noted a line of wholesale and retail garments and accessories that included Ladies' fur muffs, boas and tippets, in addition to Buffalo Robes and Bear skins, procured as well as \\"manufactured on this premises.\\" By 1847, the store, then renamed William S. Henderson & Co., had established itself at 12 Buade Street. Eventually the store moved to larger premises at 35 Buade where it remained for many years. Over the decades that followed, the store's ownership changed hands, as various partners came and went, and the firm's name underwent revision. W.S. Henderson eventually sold the store to his brother John, a Montreal businessman, and it became John Henderson & Co. In 1862, with the addition of business partner George Richard Renfrew, the store's name changed to Henderson, Renfrew and Company. By the time of Confederation, in 1867, Henderson had retired and Renfrew and V.H. Marcou, whom Henderson had sent to Quebec to manage the business, had become the new principals, with the firm renamed Renfrew & Marcou. =Furriers to the British monarchy= Sir John A. MacDonald, first Canadian prime minister, in a G.R. Renfrew & Co. fur coat, by portrait photographer William James Topley, Ottawa, 1883. By the middle of the 19th century, the company had begun promoting its fur garments beyond Quebec to a larger North American and European market. An 1890 mail order fur catalogue listed nine different medals and diplomas won at London, Paris, and Philadelphia exhibitions from 1851 to 1888. During its history, the store served many notable patrons. Admirers of Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada‚Äôs first Prime Minister, had decided the coat he had worn during an 1883 visit to Quebec City was not befitting his status as first minister and bought him a new fur coat from the company. Then, in 1886, G.R. Renfrew & Co. received its most prestigious honour, being named \\"Furriers in Ordinary\\" by Her Majesty Queen Victoria. The Queen had purchased a number of fur items from the company‚Äôs display at the Indian & Colonial Exhibition held that year at London, England. The Quebec Daily Telegraph wrote at length about the appointment: Cover of the G.R. Renfrew & Co. fur catalogue from the 1890‚Äì91 season. > Visitors to the late provincial exhibition in this city will remember that > lithographed copies in duplicate were shown of the royal letters patent from > the Mistress of the Robes at Windsor Castle, notifying Messrs.

It was, in fact, the first of a series of royal warrants issued by members of the British Royal Family. In 1901, Holt, Renfrew & Co. was appointed furriers to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra and then to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, in 1903. In 1910, the company was appointed by royal warrant furriers to His Majesty King George V. The last of the royal warrants was issued by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII, in 1921. In 1889, the company established its first store outside of Quebec City with a new retail outlet at 71 and 73 King Street East, Toronto. William Henderson had by this time retired and his nephew, Allen E. Renfrew, had become partner. Operations during 20th century =1900-1949= Before World War II Holt Renfrew & Co. Limited display, Franco-British Exhibition, London, England, 1908. In 1900, John Henderson Holt, who began his career as a company clerk, was appointed president and the firm became known as Holt, Renfrew & Co. By 1908, the company's structure had changed again and it had become Holt, Renfrew & Co., Limited. Meanwhile, the company continued to display its furs at various international expositions, such as the Franco-British Exhibition, held in London, England, that same year. Described as a \\"great merger of fur firms\\" by the press, in 1910 Holt Renfrew acquired Dunlop, Cook Co. Limited, and established new premises at Montreal, on fashionable St. Catherine St. W., in addition to taking over the firm of W. J. Hammond, \\"the largest fur house in the West,\\" at Winnipeg, Manitoba. With the death of John H. Holt in 1915, A.E. Renfrew was appointed company president, a position he held until his retirement in 1919.Holt Renfrew newspaper advertisement announces its new Toronto store in The Globe, June 20, 1910. In 1937, in conjunction with the company‚Äôs 100th anniversary, Holt Renfrew unveiled a new six-storey Montreal headquarters and flagship store. Designed by the Canadian architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald, the structure was built in what became known as the Streamline Moderne style of Art Deco. Women‚Äôs Wear Daily wrote of the limestone structure, located at the corner of Sherbrooke and Mountain streets, as \\"one of the most modernly and attractively appointed retail establishments on this continent\\" and further commented that \\"throughout the store the aim has been to secure an effect of luxury and good taste.\\" Press reports also noted the new store's commitment to haute couture and how \\"New York fashions, as well as London and Paris models, are represented in the dress, coat, sportswear, millinery and other fashion departments.\\" Holt Renfrew also retailed the work of Canadian high-fashion designers such as Marie-Paule Nolin, whose salon and workroom were hosted by the store during the 1940s. With the outbreak of armed conflict in Europe and Canada's early entry into World War II, Holt Renfrew's fashion reflected the new homefront realities. With the rationing of textiles and other materials, the company's designs featured shorter sleeves and raised hemlines. Retail expansion during this time was muted, with the exception of Holt Renfrew's acquisition of Simon Furs of Ottawa in 1945. Holt Renfrew's Montreal store, designed by the Canadian architectural firm Ross and Macdonald, under construction in 1937. The Art Deco structure was completed the same year as the chain's 100-year anniversary. After World War II The conclusion of war saw Holt Renfrew re-emerge as Canada's leading furrier and fashion retailer, closely associated with the haute couture of the post-war era. In 1947, on the eve of the impending marriage of Princess Elizabeth, heir to the British throne, and Prince Philip, the company was commissioned by the Canadian government to design the country‚Äôs official wedding gift for the princess. President Alvin J. Walker flew to London, England, with a selection of 85 samples to personally show and take measurements for the Labrador wild mink coat. Early in the post-war period, Holt Renfrew re-established close working relationships with the leading fashion houses of Europe and North America. By 1947, Alvin Walker signed an agreement with the House of Christian Dior to sell its Paris haute couture in Canada. With Dior's \\"New Look,\\" and its renewed emphasis on luxury and femininity in women‚Äôs fashion making headlines, it was the beginning of an extended relationship that \\"linked the name of Holt Renfrew to the most famous fashion designer in the world at the time.\\" The arrangement soon evolved into an exclusive one as Walker secured an agreement to solely represent Dior in the Canadian marketplace. Newspaper ads for Dior fashion explicitly noted, \\"only at Holt Renfrew in all of Canada.\\" Along with Dior, the couture models of other well-known Paris designers were also featured: > Holt Renfrew's own fashionists attended the recent Winter Openings of the > leading couturiers in Paris. The models selected by them are here...they > have arrived by air express. This collection...the largest ever imported by > H.R...presents a composite and perfect picture of the New Fashion created by > Paris...the dramatic \\"Wing Line\\" by CHRISTIAN DIOR...the lovely subtle > straightline with sudden flare sponsored by PIERRE BALMAIN...the flattering > backward drapery by JACQUES FATH...the sylph-line skirt and Bryonic corsage > by MOLYNEUX...the higher waistline ROBERT PIGUET...the tubular skirt with > stiffened pockets by JACQUES GRIFFE...and the most perfect black dresses by > BALENCIAGA. Included are all types of costumes from the typically Parisian > tailleur...for the morning promenade in the Bois...to gay short evening > dresses and formal gowns with daring decolletes and short irregular trains. Holt Renfrew also secured exclusive Canadian rights to the haute couture of Italian designers Simonetta Visconti and Fabiani. Its representatives not only made frequent trips to the fashion houses of Paris, London, New York and Milan but also attended all major fur and fashion shows. One magazine writer commented on how the \\"eternal watchfulness of Holt Renfrew buyers on the world's fashion fronts and their close liaison with outstanding designers and creators of fashions plays an important part in the rapidly growing roster of Holt Renfrew customers.\\" The company hosted some of the leading international designers. In 1952, Mr. Christian Dior was guest of honour at Holts in Montreal. Three years later, Dior was present for a fashion show of his creations at Holt Renfrew's new Toronto store, located along the Mink Mile at 144 Bloor Street West ‚Äì the country's first ever all stainless steel building, noteworthy for its \\"modern facade of blue glass and gleaming material.\\" Dior models, from Paris and New York, were specially flown in for the runway event. =1950-1999= The 1950s also saw the retailer establish new stores in secondary markets, including Edmonton in 1950, Calgary and London in 1953. The chain also opened outlets in some of the country's most prominent luxury hotels, including the Royal York, the Chateau Frontenac, and the Chateau Laurier.Canadian Register of Commerce & Industry, University of Western Ontario, , (retrieved March 16, 2007) The 1960s saw Holt Renfrew build on its reputation as a high-end luxury retailer, closely associated with the leading European fashion houses. In 1962, the company announced that it had secured an exclusive agreement to represent Paris designer Yves Saint Laurent and his haute couture in Canada. At the same time, the chain promoted new, more affordable, ready-to-wear fashion designed to attract a younger clientele. It established in-store shops for its Miss Renfrew line, marketed to \\"Young Careerists, College Girls, and Young Matrons,\\" who wished to dress fashionably on a budget. Holt Renfrew's retail expansion continued with mall openings at Toronto's Yorkdale Shopping Centre in 1964 and Place Ste-Foy, Quebec City, in 1965.Sirant, Zenya. Anniversary Party: After 170 Years, Holt Renfrew Takes a Moment to Look Back. Holts. Women's Fall 2007. pp. 142‚Äì3. By the mid-Sixties, Holt Renfrew experienced a change of ownership with the announcement that the Canadian Acceptance Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of C.I.T. Financial of New York, had acquired 93 percent of the company‚Äôs shares ‚Äì that after a brief period of ownership by English retailer Blackett & Son Ltd. In 1971, Canadian Acceptance Corporation sold Holt Renfrew to Los Angeles-based department store holding company Broadway-Hale (later renamed Carter Hawley Hale). The decade also saw a change in leadership as Alvin J. Walker retired after 25 years as company president in 1967. He was succeeded by Lenard M. Shavick. Shavick, who joined Holt Renfrew in the post-war years as a buyer, saw to the chain's continued close relationship with the fashion houses of Europe and North America with frequent buying trips aboard. \\"Every year, Shavick makes three or four trips to the fashion capitals while his staff of 18 buyers follow through with as many as 60 or 70 of their own.\\" Shavick further saw to the expansion of the chain's retail footprint with eleven new stores for a total of 23 outlets by 1971. He unveiled Holt Renfrew‚Äôs first West Coast store at the new Pacific Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1975. Four years later, he oversaw the development of the company‚Äôs new Toronto flagship store, at 50 Bloor Street West, with some 73,000 square feet of retail space, at a cost of $6.5 million. In 1983, the chain's Edmonton branch opened a $6 million, 45,000 square foot store in Manulife Place ‚Äì the city's newest and tallest building. Holt Renfrew flagship store on Bloor Street in Toronto The 1980s saw Holt Renfrew return to Canadian ownership after Carter Hawley Hale of Los Angeles put Holt, its only foreign asset, up for sale. In April 1986, an agreement with Wittington Investments Limited, a Weston family holding company led by W. Galen Weston, was announced. With Michael Brickell as company president, Galen Weston as chairman and wife Hilary M. Weston as vice-chairman, the chain underwent dramatic changes, including the introduction of new retail formats and extensive interior renovations to its lead Toronto and Montreal stores. The new owners gutted some 7,000 square feet at the Bloor Street West flagship to accommodate new designer boutiques, as the retailer moved to restore a sense of luxury and intimacy. They hired New York retail designer Naomi Leff to guide the renovations and changes to its merchandising mix. In Montreal, they began work to revitalize the grandeur of the original 1937 Art Deco architecture of the Sherbrooke St. store and added Giorgio Armani and Yves Saint Laurent shops to both Toronto and Montreal. A new high-end Holt Renfrew retail magazine, called \\"Point of View,\\" was launched a year later. The 1990s, under president Joel Rath, saw further expansion with some 62 thousand square feet of retail space added, in particular to Holt's landmark Montreal store. The Sherbrooke Street site doubled its space in a $30 million expansion that pushed into adjoining buildings to accommodate luxury brand boutiques including Chanel. The decade closed with the appointment of veteran British retailer Andrew Jennings as company president. Jennings vowed to make Holt Renfrew \\"one of the world's great fashion and lifestyle stores.\\" Operations during 21st century =2000-2009= Holt Renfrew in Calgary Holt Renfrew in Vancouver The company entered the new millennium with the relaunch of its retail magazine under the name \\"Holts.\\" The seasonal publication became separate women's and men's editions in 2006. Holt Renfrew also began sponsoring a series of large scale promotional events. In 2002, it hosted 'Viva Italia,' a celebration of Italian fashion and the performing arts. A year later, the retailer marked 'Flick,' a Sixites theme gala that coincided with the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2004, Holt Renfrew and Vanity Fair presented 'Vinyl,' a \\"hot pink, style-in-the-groove\\" celebration of music and fashion. With the departure of Andrew Jennings, Caryn Lerner took over as president in 2004. Lerner, the first woman to lead Holt Renfrew, had previously held senior management positions at QVC, Jones New York, Barneys New York and Bloomingdale's and Escada. In 2005, Holt Renfrew underwent an extensive rebranding. Led by Alannah Weston, creative director at Selfridges and daughter of Holt Renfew chairman W. Galen Weston, a new logo, reflecting the company's historic past, and magenta colour was adopted across the chain. Other changes included the return of children's wear and more retail space devoted to footwear. More than three decades after opening its first Vancouver outlet, Holt Renfrew unveiled a new store at 737 Dunsmuir Street in June 2007. Described by one design critic as a \\"glossy monument to high-end chic the store featured a pillowed glass exterior and a three-storey atrium. At 110,000 square feet, the new space represented more than double the retail square footage of the old store at 633 Granville Street, located at the opposite end of the Pacific Centre. Two years later, a new Calgary store was officially unveiled. Both retail spaces were the design work of the New York City firm of Janson Goldstein. =2010-present= In 2010, Canadian retail executive Mark Derbyshire replaced Caryn Lerner as president. Derbyshire expressed his desire to do more to appeal to the men's segment of the fashion market. hr2 at Vaughan Mills In 2012, Holt Renfrew marked its 175th anniversary with a series of major events across the country. Birthday celebrations were capped off with the release of limited edition HR175 designer merchandise and a large street party at its Bloor Street West store. Most recently, the company announced a new retail initiative called \\"hr2,\\" a chain of outlets focused on mid-priced designer merchandise and luxury goods. Stores , Holt Renfrew operates eight stores in four provinces. The Bloor Street, Yorkdale (Toronto), Montreal, and Vancouver locations include Holts Caf√©, an informal diner-like restaurant concept, that features tartine made from Poilane bread that is flown in directly from Paris, France. The 80-seat Vancouver location was designed by Yabu Pushelberg. Holts Caf√©s long planned for Square One and Calgary have not materialized. Holt Renfrew also has contributed to promote new brands, such as Greta Constantine, designed by Kirk Pickersgill and Stephen Wong. In October 2014, the company opened a 16,500 square foot menswear-only location called Holt Renfrew Men at 100 Bloor St W, next to the 55,000 square foot Harry Rosen Inc. flagship store, to complement the existing Holt Renfrew flagship store at 50 Bloor St W. In July 2016, the company opened a 130,000-square-foot location at Square One Shopping Center in Mississauga, Ontario, while a smaller Sherway Gardens location nearby closed the same month. The closure of the Ottawa and Quebec City stores was announced in August 2014. Other recent closures include the \\"Last Call\\" end-of-the-line store at Vaughan Mills in Vaughan, Ontario and the Last Call outlet in Winnipeg. Kives, Bartley.

Richta was born in Prague. Richta's first work was ƒålovƒõk a technika v revoluci na≈°ich dn≈Ø (\\"Man and Technology in the Revolution of Our Day\\"), published in 1963. This work did much to bring the concept of technology into the forefront of philosophical thought during the 1960s. Richta then went on to publish Civilizace na rozcest√≠ (\\"Civilization at the Crossroads\\") in 1966.Richta, Radovan \\"Civilizace na rozcest√≠\\" (\\"Civilization at the Crossroads\\"), Svoboda, Praha 1966, in Czech \\"Crossroads\\" was a compilation work published by 60 authors (including and led by Richta) that \\"attempt[ed] to analyze the social and human implications of the scientific and technological revolution\\".\\"Civilization at the Crossroads\\", Third expanded edition. Trans. Marian Slingova, p. 13 The concepts touched on in \\"Crossroads\\" are considered by some philosophical historians to be very ground-breaking for their time. Richta developed the famous term of \\"Socialism with a human face\\" serving as a motto of the Prague Spring period. He became the director of the Institute for Philosophy and Sociology of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (ƒåSAV - ƒåeskoslovensk√° akademie vƒõd) in 1969 - 1982.coll. \\"ƒåesk√° sociologie v letech 1965‚Äì1989\\" (\\"The Czech Sociology in the Years 1965-1989\\"), pg. 705, in Czech, accessed November 14, 2010\\"Prosinec 1969\\" , Syndik√°t novin√°≈ô≈Ø ƒåesk√© republiky (\\"Syndicate of the Journalists of the Czech Republic\\"), in Czech, accessed November 14, 2010  Life  During World War II, Richta organized a resistance movement against the Nazis, and his organization became part of the communist resistance in the critical moment of the worst persecution (or man- hunting). Richta was arrested and held prisoner for several months. He was saved by the Swiss Red Cross when they collected prisoners with the worst cases of tuberculosis and extracted them to Switzerland. Shortly after the rescue Ritcha's former fellow prisoners were executed on May 2, 1945.The translation is vague - the author could have meant the prisoners were killed without sentence.Jan Sm√≠≈°ek. \\"Chov√°me se jako revolucion√°≈ôi?\\" (\\"We act as revolutionaries?\\"), Marathon 4 (August 1997), in Czech. Accessed Jan 14 2011. After the war Richta became quite ill, and beginning in 1958 he periodically spent time in sanatoria. In between bouts of sickness, and in a compromise with his doctors who prescribed complete bed rest, Richta studied and worked very hard. In the 1960s Richta took on the role of the leader of an interdisciplinary research team. In 1963 they released their first works - ƒålovƒõk a technika v revoluci na≈°ich dn≈Ø (\\"Man and technology in the revolution of our days\\") and Komunismus a promƒõny lidsk√©ho ≈æivota (K povaze humanismu na≈°√≠ doby) (\\"Communism and changes of human life.

Promoted as an arts and culture centre, it has developed a large tourism industry. Ubud's population of about 112,490 people and receives more than 3 million foreign tourists each year. The area surrounding the town is made up of small farms, rice paddies, agroforestry plantations, and tourist accommodations. As of 2018, more tourists visited Ubud than Denpasar in southern Bali.  History  Market scene in Ubud, around 1912 Eighth-century legend tells of a Javanese priest, Rsi Markendya, who meditated at the confluence of two rivers (an auspicious site for Hindus) at the Ubud locality of Campuhan. Here he founded the Gunung Lebah Temple on the valley floor, the site of which remains a pilgrim destination.Picard (1995) The town was originally important as a source of medicinal herbs and plants; Ubud gets its name from the Balinese word ubad (medicine). In the late nineteenth century, Ubud became the seat of feudal lords who owed their allegiance to the king of Gianyar, at one time the most powerful of Bali's southern states. The lords were members of the Balinese Kshatriya caste of Suk, and were significant supporters of the village's increasingly renowned arts scene. Tourism on the island developed after the arrival of Walter Spies, an ethnic German born in Russia who taught painting and music, and dabbled in dance. Spies and foreign painters Willem Hofker and Rudolf Bonnet entertained celebrities including Charlie Chaplin, No√´l Coward, Barbara Hutton, H.G. Wells and Vicki Baum. They brought in some of the greatest artists from all over Bali to teach and train the Balinese in arts, helping Ubud become the cultural centre of Bali. Another foreign artist Han Snel was a dutch soldier who discovered Ubud after his military service building a studio with his new wife Siti, his painting captured the imagination of both foreigners and Balinese alike with his invigorating synthesis of both cultures.Hoffman, Bali the ultimate guide(2012) Antonio Blanco a Spanish/American artist lived in Ubud from 1952 till his death in 1999.Hogan, A Guide to Bali (1974) A new burst of creative energy came in the 1960s after the arrival of Dutch painter Arie Smit (b. 1916) and the development of the Young Artists Movement. The Bali tourist boom since the late 1960s has seen much development in the town; however, it remains a centre of artistic pursuit. In 2002, terrorist bombings caused a decline in tourism throughout Bali including Ubud. In response to this a writer's festival was created, Ubud Writers and Readers Festival to help revive tourism, the island's main economic lifeline.  Streets  The main street is Jalan Raya Ubud (Jalan Raya means main road), which runs east‚Äìwest through the center of town. Two long roads, Jalan Monkey Forest and Jalan Hanoman, extend south from Jalan Raya Ubud.  Buildings  Puri Saren Agung is a large palace located at the intersection of Monkey Forest and Raya Ubud roads. The residence of Tjokorda Gede Agung Sukawati (1910‚Äì1978), the last ruling monarch of Ubud, it is still owned by the royal family. Dance performances and ceremonies are held in its courtyard. The palace was also one of Ubud's first hotels, opening its doors back in the 1930s. A number of Hindu temples exist, such as Pura Desa Ubud, which is the main temple, Pura Taman Saraswati, and Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, the temple of death. The Gunung Kawi temple is the site of the royal tombs. Goa Gajah, also known as the Elephant Cave, is located in a steep valley just outside Ubud near the town of Bedulu. The Moon of Pejeng, in nearby Pejeng, is the largest single-cast bronze kettle drum in the world, dating from circa 300BC. It is a popular destination for tourists interested in local culture.  Transportation  Like other towns popular with tourists in Bali, it is not permitted to order a metered taxi or ride-sharing service for pickup within Ubud. Instead, a taxi and price must be negotiated with a member of the local taxi cooperative. This protectionist system ensures the driver is from the local area, and also keeps the fares inflated to up to 10 times the rates available elsewhere.  Economy  The economy of Ubud is highly reliant on tourism which focuses on shopping, resorts, museums, yoga, and zoos. There is a strong focus on sustainable economy in regard to the retail industry in Ubud, with many Bali-grown brands favoring materials and ingredients that would not cause much waste to the environment. From home and living amenities to tropical clothing brands, Ubud has quite a unique array of retail selections that have proven attractive to tourists from around the world. One of the initiatives that have boosted Ubud as another popular tourist destination in recent years is Ubud Food Festival (UFF). Happening in less than a week in every April, this festival brings fellow restaurateurs and restaurants in Ubud together to create either special menus or particular promotions that may not be available in other months. In contrast to the tourist area in southern Bali, the Ubud area is less densely populated by locals. However, tourists far outnumber locals, with the Gianyar regency seeing 3,842,663 tourist arrivals in 2017 - 1.3 million alone visiting Ubud's Monkey Forest.  Culture  The town and area has a number of art museums, such as the Blanco Renaissance Museum, the Puri Lukisan Museum, Neka Art Museum, and the Agung Rai Museum of Art. The Museum Rudana in Peliatan is nearby. Galleries promoting local and overseas crafts are abound, too, in Ubud. Some often hold exhibitions focused on stimulating a dialogue between both local and international artists, and less about selling artworks. One of the primary examples is BIASA ArtSpace, founded by art enthusiast and fashion designer Susanna Perini. The Tek Tok is a traditional Balinese dance that is accompanied by musical sound of mouth 'Tek Tok' altogether with various combinations of body movement and other sounds. The story Draupadi Parwa told in the Tek Tok Dance tells a moral message, when a woman who embodies the values of patience, sacrifice, compassion, devotion, and holy sincerity is disrespected, then disasters and calamities will befall a kingdom or state. This story also conveys the message that truth, virtue, devotion and genuine compassion will always be protected by God. The Tek Tok dance performance is held regularly at the Bali Culture Center (BCC) in Ubud four times a week. Ubud Writers and Readers Festival (UWRF) is held every year, which is participated by writers and readers from all over the world. Many Balinese dances are performed around Ubud including the Legong by the Peliatan Dance Group, the first troupe to travel abroad.Linda Hoffman, Bali The Ultimate Guide,Pg163 Climate Ubud has a tropical rainforest climate (Af).  Nature  The Mandala Suci Wenara Wana is known to westerners as the Ubud Monkey Forest. The grounds contain an active temple and are located near the southern end of Monkey Forest Street. This protected area houses the Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, and as of June 2017, approximately 750 crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys live there. The Campuhan ridge walk is a hill in nearby Campuhan, from where one can see two rivers, Tukad Yeh Wos Kiwa and Tukad Yeh Wos Tengen, merge. A one meter wide paved-block track runs about two kilometers to the top of the hill which is a popular spot to watch the sunset.

He later joined the carrier .Obituary, The Times, 9 August 1958 Molesworth first appeared in Punchhttps://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n04/thomas-jones/swete-lavender in 1939, and later became the protagonist and narrator of four books: Down with Skool! (1953), How to be Topp (1954), Wizz for Atomms (1956) and, after Willans's death, Back in the Jug Agane (1959). All four were collected in The Compleet Molesworth. Comic misspellings, erratic capitalisation and schoolboy slang are threads running through all the books. According to Ronald Searle in his obituary of Willans in The Times: \\"His cunning was more refined than Bunter... Willans was delighted that schoolmasters, far from feeling publicly disrobed, were in fact giving away his books as end of school prizes.\\"Obituary, The Times, 9 August 1958 Willans wrote other books as well. A review in The Times described his novel The Whistling Arrow (1957) as having a futuristic aeroplane as the 'heroine'; \\"It is his apparent strength in writing about planes and the people that flew them.\\" The reviewer compared it with one of Evelyn Waugh's earlier novels.The Times, 12 September 1957 The idea of a 'whistling arrow' was popularised by the Walt Disney Studio film The Story of Robin Hood, starring Richard Todd, where arrows that whistled were used as signals between Robin and his outlaw band. Willans also co-wrote the screenplay for the film The Bridal Path (1959), which starred George Cole, but he died of a heart attackhttp://ahistoryblog.com/2012/11/26/geoffrey- willans-1911-1958-as-any-ful-kno/ in London at the age of 47 before the film was released. He also wrote a number of other, mostly humorous, books, including The Dog's Ear Book (also with Searle), My Uncle Harry (an exploration of the British gentlemen's club), Fasten Your Lapstraps! (an account of the early days of intercontinental flight) and Admiral on Horseback (a more serious one about the Royal Navy). Bibliography =Molesworth= *Down with Skool!

Those affected are often taller than average. Usually there are no other physical differences and normal fertility. Occasionally there are learning difficulties, decreased muscle tone, seizures, or kidney problems. Triple X is due to a random event. Triple X can result either during the division of the mother's reproductive cells or during division of cells during early development. It is not typically inherited from one generation to the next. A form where only a percentage of the body cells contain XXX can also occur. Diagnosis is by chromosomal analysis. Treatment may include speech therapy, physical therapy, and counseling. It occurs in about one in every 1,000 female births. It is estimated that 90% of those affected are not diagnosed as they either have no or only few symptoms. It was first identified in 1959. Signs and symptoms Because the vast majority of triple X females are never diagnosed, it may be very difficult to make generalizations about the effects of this syndrome. The samples that were studied were small and may be nonrepresentative. Because of the lyonization, inactivation, and formation of Barr bodies in all female cells, only one X chromosome is active at any time. A person with triple X syndrome will have two Barr bodies in each cell, leading to most persons having only mild effects or no effects. The symptoms vary from person to person, with some people being more affected than others. =Physical= Symptoms may include tall stature, vertical skin folds that may cover the inner corners of the eyes (epicanthal folds), poor muscle tone, and a curve in the 5th finger towards the 4th. There may also be a small head (microcephaly). There are seldom any observable physical anomalies in triple X females, other than being taller than average. Poor coordination may be present. Those affected appear to have higher rates of scoliosis. File:XXXSyndromeA.pngEpicanthal folds and increased distance between the eyes in a 2-year-old female with trisomy X File:Sampleclinodactyly.jpgThe type of finger curvature frequently seen in triple X syndrome =Psychological= Females with triple X syndrome often have delayed language development. On average those affected have IQs that are 20 points lower. Poor self-esteem, anxiety, and depression are also common. Cause Problems in male meiosis resulting in a male gamete with 2 X-chromosomes. Problems in female meiosis resulting in a female gamete with 2 X-chromosomes. Triple X syndrome is not inherited, but usually occurs as an event during the formation of reproductive cells (ovum and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with additional chromosomes. For example, an oocyte or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of the X chromosome as a result of the non-disjunction. If one of these cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra X chromosome in each of her cells. In some cases, trisomy X occurs during cell division in early embryonic development. Some females with triple X syndrome have an extra X chromosome in only some of their cells. These cases are called 46,XX/47,XXX mosaics. Diagnosis The vast majority of triple X women are never diagnosed, unless they undergo tests for other medical reasons later in life. Triple X can be diagnosed by a blood test which is able to look at a person‚Äôs chromosomes (karyotype). Abnormalities on the electroencephalography may be present. Triple X syndrome can be diagnosed prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. By 1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, the number of abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a prenatal diagnosis of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced. English translation from original Dutch by Jill Balfour. Treatment A stable home environment can improve some of the symptoms. Epidemiology Triple X syndrome occurs in around 1 in 1,000 girls. On average, five to ten girls with triple X syndrome are born in the United States each day. History The first published report of a woman with a 47,XXX karyotype was by Patricia A. Jacobs, et al. at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959. It was found in a 35‚Äëyear-old, 5 ft. 9 in. (176 cm) tall, 128 lb. (58.2 kg) woman who had premature ovarian failure at age 19; her mother was age 41 and her father was 40 at the time of her conception. Jacobs, et al. called the 47,XXX woman a \\"superfemale\\", a term which was immediately criticized, did not gain acceptance, and was based on the incorrect assumption that the sex- determination system in mammals was the same as in the fruit fly Drosophila. British pathologist and geneticist Bernard Lennox, the principal consultant on medical terms for the Oxford English Dictionary, suggested the term \\"XXX syndrome\\".

This type of locking mechanism consists of a single dial which must be rotated left and right in a certain combination in order to open the lock. Contained inside the mechanism are discs, usually three, with notches that must be aligned to allow for a release of the piece holding the lock in place, and the lock to open. The positions of the discs are manipulated by turning the dial left and right; on the dial is a catch‚Äîa sort of nub‚Äîand on each side of the discs is also a small catch. As the dial rotates, there will not be enough space for the catch on the dial to pass the catch on that side of the disc, and so the disc will begin to rotate with the dial. As this disc rotates, its catch will in turn begin rotating the next disc in a similar fashion. Once all discs and the dial are rotating together, the dial is rotated until the last disc is in place and the notch is in the proper positioning, then by rotating the dial in the other direction, the catches will all disconnect, starting from the dial to the first disc and so on until they connect from the other side and the discs begin to rotate together by the same method but in the opposite direction. In this way, the remaining discs are able to rotate and change their position without further disturbing the last disc. The process is completed back and forth until all discs are in place, and the lock is released.

From 1999 until 2005 she was the chair and CEO of TVOntario/TFO, Ontario's provincial public television network. She has been a controversial figure at times, but is also a highly regarded pioneer in Canadian broadcasting. Background Bassett was born Isabel Glenthorne Macdonald\\"Isabel Glenthorne Macdonald\\" bassettbranches.org June 24, 2018 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She received a Bachelor of Arts from Queen's University and a Master of Arts from York University in 1973. As well, she graduated from teacher's college and taught English and French at Humberside Collegiate Institute. Bassett first entered Canadian public life as a journalist for the Toronto Telegram in the 1960s. She later joined CTV, where she became a prominent reporter and documentary producer, including a stint with W5, after marrying Baton Broadcasting owner John Bassett on July 17, 1967.\\"Isabel Glenthorne Macdonald\\" bassettbranches.org June 24, 2018 Although her documentary work for CTV won numerous awards, she was sometimes accused of having been given her position solely because she was married to the owner. John Bassett died in 1998, and Isabel subsequently began a relationship with cabinet colleague Ernie Eves. Bassett has also written a number of books on the political, social and historical achievements of Canadian women. Politics In the federal election of 1993, Bassett ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul's. She lost to Liberal Barry Campbell by over 15,000 votes. Bassett was elected in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal candidate Carolyn Bennett (later a federal Member of Parliament) by about 3,500 votes. She served as the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for St. Andrew‚ÄîSt. Patrick for the next four years. On October 10, 1997, she was appointed Minister of Citizenship, Culture and Recreation in the government of Mike Harris. Despite the Harris government's right-wing reputation, Bassett is a Red Tory, and was one of the most socially progressive members of the Harris cabinet. In the 1999 provincial election, Bassett was defeated in the new provincial riding of St. Paul's by Liberal candidate Michael Bryant. She was one of several Toronto Progressive Conservatives defeated in the city due to the unpopularity of Harris' government. =Cabinet positions= TV Ontario After the election, Bassett was appointed as head of TVOntario by Mike Harris. Her mandate was to refocus the network on educational programming; however, Bassett successfully found ways to ensure that the network's most popular non- educational programs, such as Saturday Night at the Movies and Studio 2, could continue to air. Bassett's position again became controversial when Eves became Premier of Ontario in 2002, with media critics noting the potential conflict of interest inherent in Bassett remaining as head of TVOntario while simultaneously in a common law relationship with the provincial premier. However, Bassett was popular within TVOntario, and the controversy soon subsided. She remained chair and CEO of TVOntario until September 29, 2005, when the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty separated the two positions. Bassett's successors were film producer Peter O'Brian as chair, and former Astral Media executive Lisa de Wilde as CEO. Honours In 2016, she was made a member of the Order of Ontario. On June 30, 2016, Bassett was made a Member of the Order of Canada for \\"her community engagement and commitment to the advancement of women and public service, notably in educational broadcasting.\\" References =Citations= =Further reading= * Canadian Business, Vol. 78, Issue 19, Live and Learn interviewed by Erin Pooley External links * Category:Living people Category:1939 births Category:Canadian chief executives Category:Canadian television reporters and correspondents Category:Women government ministers of Canada Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Members of the Order of Ontario Category:People from Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:TVOntario executives Category:Women MPPs in Ontario Category:Canadian women television journalists Category:Women chief executives Category:York University alumni Category:CTV Television Network people ","title":"Isabel Bassett"},{"id":"1260515","text":"The Party of Albanian National Union (UNIKOMB - Partia e Unitetit Komb√´tar Shqiptar) is a small political party in Kosovo.

It is fairly easy to find in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and in South Florida, but rather obscure elsewhere. History Dr. Brown‚Äôs sodas are kosher and are often found at Jewish delicatessens and restaurants and can also be found in specialty grocers and grocery stores that specialize in American food in Israel. The flavor, derived from celery seed extract, is reminiscent of ginger ale but with a pronounced celery flavor that is more pungent or peppery than ginger ale. Dr. Brown‚Äôs Celery Tonic was, according to the company, first produced in 1868 in Brooklyn, New York. It was served in New York delicatessens starting in 1869 and sold as a bottled soda starting in 1886. The Food and Drug Administration objected to its being called a ‚Äútonic,‚Äù and in the 1900s the name was changed to Dr. Brown‚Äôs Cel-Ray (soda). Cel-Ray was so popular in the 1930s among New York City's Jewish community that it earned the nickname \\"Jewish Champagne.\\" Dr. Brown‚Äôs briefly produced a diet Cel-Ray, but it was discontinued due to low sales. Other ‚Äúcelery tonics\\"/\\"celery sodas‚Äù were produced in the 1890s, but only Dr. Brown‚Äôs celery product remains today.

Historically part of Lanarkshire, it is bounded by Glasgow Green to the west, Dalmarnock to the east and south, Calton to the north-west at Abercromby Street/London Road and Gallowgate to the north-east. History 1974 image of Bridgeton Cross It started as a small weaving village in 1705, when the third John Walkinshaw marked out a portion of his Goosefauld estate for rent.Barrowfield House (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, 1844), The Glasgow Story However, not much interest was shown until 1775 when Rutherglen Bridge was built over the River Clyde and the area became known as Bridge Town (or Brig Toun in Scots). A major employer was carpet manufacturer James Templeton & Co. Bridgeton used to be bounded by a village named Mile-End to the north, however this district seems to have vanished over the years, resulting in Bridgeton's boundary moving north to Crownpoint Road. Bridgeton Cross Bridgeton Cross with the Umbrella, former station building (background) and Olympia theatre (right) prior to renovation work. Bridgeton Cross, also known as 'The Toll' is a major junction, the meeting point of London Road (A74 towards Celtic Park), Dalmarnock Road (A749), Main Street, James Street (leading to Glasgow Green), Olympia Street and Orr Street. The intersection is notable for the \\"Brigton Umbrella\\", a Victorian (1875) cast iron bandstand covering the centre of the Cross.Glasgow‚Äôs Crosses, Glasgow History, 28 May 2016 The landmark structure and surrounds was renovated in the early 21st century, resulting in improved public realm areas and the complete refurbishment of the Umbrella. Bridgeton Cross is the location for Bridgeton railway station (opened in 1895, closed in 1964, reopened in 1979) which is on the Argyle Line connecting the area to central Glasgow. The category B listed building which previously housed Bridgeton Central railway station (1892-1979) is a short distance away. A number of local buses also pass along London Road and Dalmarnock Road. The Cross is also the location for the Olympia Theatre (built 1911), which after lying abandoned for many years has undergone rebuilding and reopened in 2012 as a library and community facility for the people of Bridgeton. There are several public houses in the vicinity, with most themed around Rangers F.C. In 1893 William Millard started Millers Linoleum Stores, renting sheds in Charles Street (now Olympia Street) from the North British Railway Company. On 26 June 1913 planning permission was granted to build a two-storey warehouse on this land, which had now been purchased by Millard. Under the directorship of William's great-grandson David Millard, the building was sympathetically renovated in 2013. Believed to be the only surviving family business from the 1800s in the area, Millers 1893 continues to operate. Points of interest Bridgeton has one of Glasgow's original Carnegie libraries, deftly designed by the Invernessian architect, James Robert Rhind. Since 2014, the library has been in use by the Glasgow Women's Library, holding a lending library, archive and museum collection, who have made significant renovations both inside and out. After the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Glasgow, Bridgeton now has international-class sporting facilities within walking distance: the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome are located in nearby Dalmarnock, with the Crownpoint Sports Complex, a modern outdoor athletics track, also located in the area adjacent to St Mungo's Academy. Bridgeton has been the centre of the Orange Order in Scotland. Their marches are a fairly common sight in Glasgow during the summer months but reach a peak around the Twelfth of July when the parades commemorating the Battle of the Boyne are in full flow. In 2019, the Sunday Times reported that concerns over an incident during the 2018 Apprentice Boys of Derry (Bridgeton) march had led to suggestions that Glasgow council reroute the march to avoid passing near two Catholic churches. The Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust, one of the largest voluntary commercial and passenger vehicle preservation groups in Scotland are based at Bridgeton Bus Garage which opened on 5 June 1965 on a site bordered by London Road to the south, Fordneuk Street to the West, Broad Street to the north and Rimsdale Street to the east. It replaced the former tram depot at Dalmarnock which had suffered fire damage. Bridgeton's use as a Glasgow Bus Garage was brief, the tendency was to use a smaller fleet of larger buses and that led to the garage being closed in 1976, however it was then taken on by Strathclyde Regional Council for its Internal Transport fleet, servicing everything from light vans to Gritting Lorries. In this capacity it later passed to Glasgow City Council who when they ceased using it for that purpose were prevailed upon to rent it out for vehicle preservation. Football For four decades in the mid-20th century, Bridgeton was represented in the Scottish Junior Football Association by Bridgeton Waverley F.C. Initially a local Juvenile team, upon joining the Junior setup they played at Shawfield Stadium (home of Clyde F.C.), then moved to Barrowfield Park which was bought and demolished by Glasgow Corporation for the construction of the housing scheme of the same name in the 1930s. Waverley then moved to New Barrowfield on the edge of the Parkhead district. After they folded in the 1960s, that site became the training ground of Celtic F.C. Another Junior club which became defunct around the same time, Strathclyde F.C., was also based in the area. Strathclyde's predecessor senior league club Thistle F.C. had their roots in Bridgeton/Dalmarnock, as did the aforementioned Clyde and the 19th century side Eastern F.C. who both once played at another Barrowfield Park. Although Celtic's stadium is nearby and their origins also stem from the Bridgeton area, the district is known for a large and passionate Rangers following.

It is the highest point on Bali, and dominates the surrounding area, influencing the climate, especially rainfall patterns. From a distance, the mountain appears to be perfectly conical. From the peak of the mountain, it is possible to see the peak of Mount Rinjani on the nearby island of Lombok, to the east, although both mountains are frequently covered in clouds. Agung is a stratovolcano, with a large and deep crater. Its most recent eruptions occurred from 2017‚Äì2019.  History of eruptions  = 1843 eruption = Agung erupted in 1843, as recorded in a report by Heinrich Zollinger: = 1963‚Äì64 eruption = The eruption of 1963 was one of the largest and most devastating eruptions in Indonesia's history. On February 18, 1963, local residents heard loud explosions and saw clouds rising from the crater of Mount Agung. On February 24, lava began flowing down the northern slope of the mountain, eventually traveling 7 km in the next 20 days. On March 17, the volcano erupted (VEI 5), sending debris 8 to 10 km into the air and generating massive pyroclastic flows. These flows devastated numerous villages, killing an estimated 1,100‚Äì1,500 people. Cold lahars caused by heavy rainfall after the eruption killed an additional 200. A second eruption on May 16 led to pyroclastic flows that killed another 200 inhabitants. Minor eruptions and flows followed and lasted almost a year. The lava flows missed, sometimes by mere yards, the Mother Temple of Besakih. The saving of the temple is regarded by Balinese as miraculous and a signal from the gods that they wished to demonstrate their power but not destroy the monument that the Balinese had erected. Andesite was the dominant lava type with some samples mafic enough to be classified as basaltic andesite.Self, S., and M.R. Rampino, 2012: The 1963‚Äì1964 eruption of Agung volcano (Bali, Indonesia). Bull. Vulcanol., 74, 1521‚Äì1536 The eruption had global effects on temperatures. = 2017-2019 seismic activity and eruption = Mount Agung erupting on 27 November 2017 In September 2017, the area experienced 844 volcanic earthquakes, peaking at 300 to 400 earthquakes on 26 September. The frequency and intensity of these quakes caused much alarm among seismologists, as similar volcanoes have historically been known to erupt with even fewer warning signs. The alert level was raised to the highest level and about 122,500 people were evacuated from their houses around the volcano. The Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority declared a 12-kilometre exclusion zone around the volcano on 24 September. Evacuees gathered in sports halls and other community buildings around Klungkung, Karangasem, Buleleng, and other areas. By late October 2017, the activity of the volcano decreased significantly, leading to lowering of the highest status of emergency on 29 October. On 21 November, activity increased once again. A phreatic eruption took place, with the ash cloud top reaching above sea level. Thousands of people immediately fled the area, and over 29,000 temporary refugees were reported to be housed in over 270 locations nearby. Early on Saturday 25 November a magmatic eruption began. The resulting eruption plume was reported to rise about 1.5‚Äì4 km above the summit crater, drifting towards the south and dusting the surroundings with thin layer of dark ash, leading some airlines to cancel flights bound for Australia and New Zealand. An orange glow was later observed around the crater at night, suggesting that fresh magma had indeed reached the surface. On 26 November 2017, another eruption occurred, the second in less than a week. Ngurah Rai International Airport was closed 26 November 2017, leaving many tourists stranded. Lahars were reported in the Selat district south of the volcano. More than 100,000 people in a radius of the volcano were ordered to evacuate. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology reported on 27 November that ash from the eruption had been observed at an altitude of 9,144 m. By the beginning of December, the eruption reduced to minor emissions of steam and smoke. On 12 December, a picture of the crater was taken showing a steadily growing lava dome occupying approximately one third of the crater. In June 2018, Agung erupted with 2 km high plumes interrupting air traffic. On 3 July, a Strombolian explosion occurred, sending debris in all directions.

The organization has produced various publications describing what it calls creation science, including a journal and a creation-based biology textbook; use of the textbook in public schools was ruled unconstitutional in Hendren v. Campbell. During the first few years of its existence, different beliefs about Creationism and disagreement over its statement of beliefs resulted in various members of the CRS board and voting members being forced out of the organization.  History  = Formation = Walter E. Lammerts formed the organization in the 1950s after becoming concerned that the American Scientific Affiliation was falling under the influence of theistic evolution. It was originally named the Creation Research Advisory Committee in February 1963, and headed by Walter E. Lammerts and Wiliam J. Tinkle with assistance from Henry M. Morris. The committee originally consisted of ten creationists: Lammerts, Tinkle, Morris, John W. Klotz, Frank Lewis Marsh, Edwin Y. Monsma, Duane Gish, Wilbert H. Rusch, John J. Grebe, and R. Laird Harris. The CRS was later formed in June 1963, with the original advisory committee constituting the new society's 'steering committee', with Karl W. Linsenmann, David A. Warriner and John N. Moore joining it at that time. At about the same time, Morris recruited Harold S. Slusher, Thomas G. Barnes, Willis L. Webb and later Clifford L. Burdlick. Finally, Paul A. Zimmerman joined it. By the end of the year had expanded to approximately fifty members. Members with at least an M.Sc. or equivalent were eligible to be voting members.Numbers(2006) p239-258 =Textbook project= In response to the Sputnik-inspired emphasis on science education, and the resultant Biological Sciences Curriculum Study textbooks (which emphasised evolution for the first time), creationists in the early 1960s were searching for an orthodox and up-to-date creationist biology textbook. The CRS responded with Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity, published in 1970 by Christian publisher Zondervan, which was a mixed success, selling out its first run of 10,000, and being approved by a number of state textbook committees but being adopted by few public schools. After an Indiana school attempted to make exclusive use of it, a state court ruled that its use in public schools was unconstitutional (in Hendren v. Campbell) stating:Numbers(2006) p264-267  Beliefs and stated purpose  The statement of belief was an issue of discussion among the 10 founders during its formation, with typical wrangling over wording, and little consensus beyond keeping out anyone supportive of evolution. There was concern that Flood Geology would be able to explain all geologic evidence and whether the six literal-day creation included the creation of the universe.Numbers(2006) p255-256 The CRS adopted the following statement of belief, mandatory for all members:CRS Statement of Belief The society's stated purpose is \\"publication and research which impinge on creation as an alternate view of origins\\".CRS History and Aims The CRS' statement of belief was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Edwards v. Aguillard. Its mandate that members affirm that the origin story described in Genesis was an established fact was cited by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. as evidence there was a fundamentalist sectarian objective in the field of creation science and in Louisiana's 1981 Balanced Treatment Act, a law requiring creation science instruction in the state's public schools wherever scientific evolution was taught. The judge ruled, \\"the intent of the Louisiana Legislature was to promote a particular religious belief\\" and therefore the teaching of creationism was unconstitutional. = Publications = The Creation Research Society Quarterly has been published since July, 1964. Creation Matters containing popular level articles has been published bi- monthly since 1996. CRS has also published an assortment of special papers, monographs and books. Creationist publications have been criticized by scientists, such as Massimo Pigliucci, as \\"nonsense\\" in their attempt to blend faith with empirical fact. Glenn R. Morton is an author of more than 20 articles published by CRS in an attempt to \\"solve scientific problems\\" of creationism. Morton later left the creationist movement complaining \\"The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data!\\". =Early purges= The organization's early growth allowed Lammerts to purge committee members who were insufficiently active or orthodox. Four committee members were removed: Monsma and Webb for inactivity, Harris for opposing a literal six-day creation, and Warriner after losing his university position and suggesting that the society hire him as a paid promoter. These members were replaced by George F. Howe, Bolton Davidheiser and H. Douglas Dean. Dean and Davidheiser left after only two years, Dean because of his unorthodox views on Evolution, and Davidheiser because he was unable to work with Seventh Day Adventists on the committee. Marsh, an Adventist, left about the same time because he interpreted the society's weekend meetings as a religious affront. By the end of 1964, the society had grown sufficiently that Lammerts decided to purge the society of Old Earth, Gap and Day Age creationists: In 1967, Lammerts arranged for Morris to succeed him as chairman of the board, in order to ensure continuing fidelity to flood geology.Numbers(2006) p259-260 Historian of creationism Ronald L. Numbers states that the Society \\"acquired a well- deserved reputation for welcoming only committed flood geologists.\\"Numbers(2006) p262 =Laboratory= The Creation Research Society maintains a working electron microscope laboratory (scanning EM and transmission EM) at the Van Andel Creation Research Center in Chino Valley, AZ, although they will be moving their operation center and research laboratories to the campus of Arizona Christian University, Glendale, AZ. Recently Mark Armitage and Kevin Anderson of the CRS published their findings of soft tissues in Triceratops horn collected at the Hell Creek Formation in Glendive, MT.

Based in Paris, the archive offers daily screenings of worldwide films. History The collection emerged from the efforts of Henri Langlois and Lotte H Eisner in the mid 1930s to collect and screen films. Langlois had acquired one of the largest collections in the world by the beginning of World War II, only to have it nearly wiped out by the German authorities in occupied France, who ordered the destruction of all films made prior to 1937. He and his friends smuggled huge numbers of documents and films out of occupied France to protect them until the end of the war. After the war, the French government provided a small screening room, staff and subsidy for the collection, which was first relocated to the Avenue de Messine. Significant French filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s, including Robert Bresson, Ren√© Cl√©ment, Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jacques Becker frequented screenings at the Cin√©math√®que. Directors of the New Wave (la Nouvelle Vague) school -- Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Roger Vadim, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Pierre Kast -- also received much of their film education by attending the collection's screenings. A meeting in 1945 in Basle between Langlois and Freddy Buache led, via Lausanne's first film club, to the founding in 1950 of the Cin√©math√®que suisse. The events of May 1968 In June 1963, the Cin√©math√®que had moved to the Palais de Chaillot with funds provided by Andr√© Malraux, Minister of Culture, and became subject to the government. In February 1968, under pressure from the Ministry of Finance, Malraux required changes in the management of the Cin√©math√®que and dismissed Henri Langlois. A defence committee was formed, uniting the cream of French filmmakers (Alexandre Astruc, Claude Berri, Robert Bresson, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Jean Eustache, Georges Franju, Abel Gance, Jean-Luc Godard, Joris Ivens, Pierre Kast, Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, Jean Rouch, Fran√ßois Truffaut) together with major actors (Jean-Pierre L√©aud, Claude Jade, Jean Marais and Fran√ßoise Rosay). Foreign filmmakers such as Charles Chaplin and Stanley Kubrick added their support. Protests were organized. Confrontations followed between young people, largely students, and what they saw as an authoritarian centre-right government, out of touch with the concerns of the younger generation. These demonstrations were precursors of and merged into the widespread student revolt that erupted from March 1968 onwards, escalating into nationwide unrest in May. Before then, the government had backed down over the Cin√©math√®que, reinstating Langlois as head in April 1968. Location After numerous incidents ‚Äî including multiple relocations from one small screening room to another through the 1950s and a fire in its last premises ‚Äî the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise moved to 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement of Paris and reopened its doors in a postmodern building designed by Frank Gehry, an American architect. A restaurant on the lower level is open to the public. The Biblioth√®que du Film, which was created in 1992 to show the history of cinema, its production, impact and artistic strength, has recently merged with the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise.

It was developed and built in collaboration by SOKO in Yugoslavia and by Avioane Craiova in neighbouring Romania, being known in the latter as the IAR-93 Vultur. The Orao was designed as either a single-seat main attack version or as a combat-capable twin-seat version, the latter being principally intended for advanced flight and weapons-training duties. It was developed as a joint Yugoslav-Romanian project, known as YuRom, during the 1970s. Early ambitions to produce a supersonic fighter were scuppered by Britain's unwillingness to permit the desired engine to be license-produced in Eastern Europe. Further difficulties in fitting an afterburner to the older Rolls-Royce Viper also hindered development and the performance of early-build aircraft. First flying during November 1974, the resulting aircraft would equip the air forces of both Romania and Yugoslavia, as well as several of Yugoslavia's successor states. On 22 November 1984, the Orao became the first Yugoslav-designed aircraft to exceed Mach 1, albeit achieved while in a shallow dive. During the 1990s, the type saw action during the Yugoslav Wars, typically flying ground-attack missions in and the Serbian province of Kosovo. As of July 2019, the Serbian Air Force and Air Defence was the only entity still operating the type. Development =Origins= During 1970, the neighbouring nations of Romania and Yugoslavia began discussions on the subject of jointly developing a new ground-attack orientated fighter aircraft.Fredriksen 2001, p. 301. On 20 May 1971, the Romanian and Yugoslavian governments signed an agreement for the formation of YuRom, a joint research and development venture between the two nations. According to aviation author John C. Fredriksen, the announcement was a logical extension of political policy, as the two nations' heads of state, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, had both historically sought to avoid overreliance upon the Soviet Union, preferring to build ties and cooperative projects with other friendly or neutral nations. The research programme was headed by Dipl. Dr. Engineer Teodor Zanfirescu of Romania and Colonel Vidoje Knezeviƒá of Yugoslavia. The aircraft was intended to be a replacement for both the lightly armed Soko J-21 Jastreb and the Republic F-84 Thunderjet that were then in the Yugoslav People's Army's (JNA) arsenal. The requirements called for a lightweight aircraft that featured a relatively simple and rugged structure, that would use locally produced equipment and avionics, capable of operating from austere airstrips (including the ability to operate either from grass or damaged runways), as well as being reliable and easy to maintain. The resulting design was of a conventional twin-engine monoplane, featuring a high-mounted wing complete with all-swept flight surfaces. According to Fredriksen, the design emphasised simplicity as well as modernity. Due to political sensitivities and a strong desire to avoid one nation upstaging the other, the aircraft featured two separate names; in Romania, it was known as the IAR-93 Vultur while in Yugoslavia it was referred to as the J-22 Orao. The design team had originally planned to develop a single-engined aircraft capable of supersonic speeds, but the United Kingdom would not authorize the license to produce the British engine that the designers had selected; the rejection was reportedly due to Romania being a member of the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact. In its place, the less-powerful Rolls-Royce Viper was chosen as the powerplant, as Soko already possessed experience with license-building this engine. It was originally intended that an afterburner would be developed for the Viper engine, but there were prolonged difficulties with this project. Due to these complications, none of the pre-production aircraft or any early production examples would be equipped with afterburners; these would be largely restricted to conducting reconnaissance missions. During the 1980s, both countries developed slightly different versions of the aircraft to take advantage of the afterburning engines that had since become available.Chant 2014, p. 468. =Into flight= J-22 Orao on display in 2012 During 31 October 1974, the Yugoslav prototype 25002 conducted its first flight from Batajnica Air Base near Belgrade, with Major Vladislav Slavujeviƒá at the controls. For political reasons, this flight was timed to deliberately coincide with the first flight of the IAR-93 Vultur prototype. The third aircraft, numbered 25003, which was a pre-production two- seater version, performed its first flight on 4 July 1977. This aircraft was lost almost a year later, the cause of the accident was attributed to the occurrence of tail flutter. Construction of further pre-production aircraft was unimpacted by the loss; during 1978, the first batches of pre-production machines were delivered to the Air Force Aircraft Testing Facility in Belgrade. Subsequent serial production was established at a facility outside Mostar, (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina); this facility would be abandoned in 1992 and heavily damaged during the Yugoslav Wars.Penney, Stewart. \\"Military Aircraft Directory Part 2.\\" Flight International, 11 August 1999. Production would never be resumed either in Yugoslavia or in its successor states. During October 1983, the first afterburner-equipped J-22 Orao was flown in Yugoslavia.\\"Military Directory: Avioane.\\" Flight International, 29 September 1998. On 22 November 1984, an Orao broke the sound barrier while in a shallow dive;World Air Power Journal Autumn/Winter 1991, p. 23. this instance made the J-22 the first Yugoslav-designed aircraft to exceed Mach 1. The aircraft is incapable of breaking the sound barrier in level flight, so it is classified as being a subsonic aircraft. Design Side-on depiction of a J-22 Modernised cockpit of a J-22 The J-22 Orao is a twin-engined combat jet aircraft designed for performing close air support (CAS), ground-attack and tactical reconnaissance missions, it also features a limited air-defense capability. The twin-seat version, the NJ-22, was primarily assigned for various training purposes, including the advanced flight and weapons training syllabuses, but could also be used for combat missions. The Orao was provisioned with standard communication and navigation equipment, the latter including a Honeywell-built SGP500 twin-gyroscope navigation system.Lambert 1993, p. 180. It incorporated a fire control and weapons management system which used the Thomson-CSF-built VE-120T head-up display (HUD) (which had replacing the original Ferranti ISIS D-282 gyro-sight). In terms of defensive sensors and systems, it was equipped with an Iskra SO-1 radar warning receiver (RWR) and provision for up to three chaff/flare dispensers, as well as a P10-65-13 passive jammer pod. Further pods could be optionally fitted, including an optical/infrared reconnaissance pod or an optical reconnaissance/jammer pod. Various upgrade programmes for the J-22 had been proposed during the 1990s; reportedly, such efforts would have been focused upon the aircraft's avionics. However, such ambitions were heavily undermined by the dismantling of the Mostar factory during the Yugoslav Wars and the collapse of Romania's communist government.\\"Aviaone (formerly IAV Craiova).\\" Flight International, 22 October 1996. During the late 2010s, Serbia launched a major modernisation programme involving both its J-22 and NJ-22 fleets. Unofficially referred to as Orao 2.0, this work involved the installation of new navigation and targeting systems, including Safran's Sigma 95 inertial navigation system, a mission computer and multi-function displays, into the NJ-22's rear cockpit which, along with new weapons, is intended to make the type more effective in ground attack missions. A more comprehensive second phase is to achieve the \\"complete digitalisation\\" of the aircraft's cockpit.Salinger, Igor. \\"Serbia outlines Orao modernisation programme.\\" Flight International, 3 July 2019. Operational history The J-22 Orao single-seat prototype on display in the Museum of Aviation in Belgrade. A pre-production two-seat aircraft served as the prototype of that version. The first Yugoslav Air Force unit to receive the J-22 was the 351st reconnaissance aviation squadron of the 82nd Aviation Brigade, Cerklje. Until the 1991 war, . There were also about three squadrons partly equipped with J-22s. At the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, in Slovenia, J-22s flew over in a show of force, but did not drop any bombs. During 1991, the first offensive action to be conducted by the J-22 occurred when the Yugoslav National Army used them to strike targets in Croatia. As a result of the conflicts of the 1990s, the majority of the former Yugoslav Air Force's aircraft were relocated to the Union of Serbia and Montenegro, with smaller numbers ending up under the control of the other new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia. The JNA left a squadron equipped with nine Oraos in the Bosnian-Serb Republika Srpska, with these aircraft becoming part of the new Republika Srpska Air Force, based at Mahovljani Airport outside the capital.Barrie & Pite Flight International 24‚Äì30 August 1994, p. 54. The airworthiness of these aircraft soon deteriorated due to the combination of limited funding and the impact of international embargoes. By June 2003, the Republika Srpska Air Force had a force of seven J-22 Oraos.Salinger, Igor. \\"Balkan rebirth.\\" Flight International, 3 June 2003. These aircraft were ultimately inherited by the unified Bosnian Air Force. By 2008, all of Bosnia's J-22s had been placed into storage while the nation negotiated with neighbouring Serbia to potentially buy them; reportedly, Serbia was viewed as the only viable customer for the type. Several ex- Yugoslav Air Force J-22s were also operated by the Air Force of the Republic of Serbian Krajina following the withdrawal of the Yugoslav National Army from Croatia.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Croatia's cocked hammer.\\" Flight International, 1 February 1995. A Serbian Air Force J-22 flying at low level, Kecskem√©t, 2007 During 1999, Yugoslav J-22s saw limited combat against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), reportedly flying 36 combat missions. One J-22, piloted by Lt. Colonel ≈Ωivota √êuriƒá, was lost on 25 March 1999 in unclear circumstances, either through malfunction, pilot error or ground fire from KLA units. In addition, eleven aircraft were destroyed on the ground, the majority of these at Ponikve Air Base, when a NATO air strike hit one hangar that reportedly had six J-22 and two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 aircraft inside. By July 2019, the Serbian Air Force was reportedly operating a fleet comprising ten J-22 and NJ-22 Oraos; in addition to these airworthy examples, the service reportedly also had further airframes in storage, including the IJ and INJ reconnaissance variants. According to aerospace periodical Flight International, the Orao's service life had been originally anticipated to be around 24 years; based on structural inspections, some airframes are in such good condition that this forecast could be effectively doubled; following an overhaul, individual J-22s can be approved to perform a further 1,000 flight hours. Variants ;IJ-22 Orao 1 :26 dedicated reconnaissance aircraft. Includes 15 pre-production aircraft converted to reconnaissance role. The IJ-22A Orao 1 differs from the J-22B Orao 2 in having two Viper Mk 632-41R turbojets each rated at 17.79 kN dry and supplied with fuel from an internal weight of 2,360 kg, length of 14.90 m including probe for single seat model or 15.38 m including probe for two-seat model, wheelbase of 5.40 m for single-seat model or 5.88 m for two- seat model, empty equipped weight of 5,755 kg, normal takeoff weight of 8,500 kg with reconnaissance pod, maximum take-off weight of 9500, maximum level speed ‚Äòclean‚Äô of 1,033 km/h at 8,000 m and 1,050 km/h at sea level, maximum rate of climb at sea level of 2,280 m per minute, climb to 6000 m in 3 minutes 12 seconds, and service ceiling of 13,500 m. ;INJ-22A Orao 1 :9 early series trainer aircraft used for training of reconnaissance pilots. ;J-22A Orao 1 :Yugoslav equivalent to IAR-93A with a non-afterburning Orao/Turbomecanica (Rolls-Royce/Bristol Siddeley) Viper Mk 632-41R turbojets each rated at 17.79 kN dry, but with J-22Bs higher-rated hardpoints.

Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art, and history, as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance, and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at the age of eleven and studied traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in, and won, several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band.RFI Music. Alan Stivell. Biography. RFI Music. (last accessed 15 July 2009) Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture, in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany. Stivell's first recording came in 1960 (\\"Musique gaelique\\"), a single that was followed by the LP Telenn Geltiek in 1964. He already recorded solo harp and harp backing singers in 1959 with Breiz ma bro (\\"Brittany my country\\") and a Mouez Breiz EP (\\"Voice of Brittany\\") with the female singer Andrea Ar Gouilh. His stage name, Stivell, means \\"fountain\\" or \\"spring\\" in Breton. The name refers both to the Breton renewal and to his surname Cochevelou (an evolution of kozh stivello√π, \\"the old fountains\\"). = Stivell and the Celtic harp revival = With a new bardic harp with bronze strings, Stivell began experimenting with modernized styles of music that became known as Celtic rock. In 1966, Alan Stivell began to perform and record as a singer. The following year, he was signed by Philips Records. This was during the birth of the New Breton and Celtic music movement. In 1968, after two years of touring and regular appearances at the American Students and Artists Center in Paris, Alan joined the Moody Blues onstage to perform in London's Queen Elizabeth Hall.JT Koch (ed). Celtic Culture. A Historical Encyclopaedia ABC-CLIO 2006 pp. 1627‚Äì1628. In 1970, Stivell released his first hits, the single \\"Broceliande\\" and the album Reflets, both on the Philips record label. He became closely associated with the burgeoning Breton roots revival, especially after the release of the purely instrumental 1971 album Renaissance of the Celtic Harp, which won one of the most famous awards in France, the prize of the Acad√©mie Charles Cros. The music critic Bruce Elder wrote of the album Renaissance of the Celtic Harp: On 28 February 1972, Stivell performed a concert in the Olympia theater, a famous music hall in Paris, where Alan and his band played music combining traditional Celtic music with modern sounds (electric guitar, drums, etc.). This concert made Stivell and his music well known throughout France. At this time, Stivell's eclectic approach to music was very new and was considered risky, but it soon became popular. Over 1,500,000 records of that concert (A l'Olympia) were sold. Alan Stivell's new found fame propelled him to tour across France, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. He continued recording, and published a collection of Breton poetry in 1976. With his 1980 Symphonie Celtique, he mixed for the first time elements of rock, a symphonic orchestra, Celtic instruments and such non-European ethnic elements as Berber vocalist Djourha and sitarist Narendra Bataju. The folk music revival faded somewhat in the 1980s. Though Alan Stivell still maintained a popular following, he did not reach the heights of popularity that he had in the 1970s. He continued touring in many parts of the world and recording for a loyal fanbase. He also worked with the English singer Kate Bush. = Celtic fusions and world music = Alan Stivell at Nuremberg, Germany, 2007 In the 1990s, Stivell recorded with the French singer Laurent Voulzy, Irish traditional performer Shane MacGowan and Senegalese singer Doudou N'Diaye Rose. The album was Again, and it became very popular in France, the beginning of a Celtic new wave. Stivell's records in the late 1990s contained more pronounced rock elements, and he performed at a rock festival called Transmusicales in Rennes. He continued working with a variety of musicians, inviting Paddy Moloney (of The Chieftains), Jim Kerr (of Simple Minds), Khaled and Youssou N'Dour to be in his very international 1 Douar / 1 Earth album. The 1998 French-language hit \\"La Tribu de Dana\\" by rap trio Manau, one of the best-selling French singles of all time, featured a very similar musical arrangement to Stivell's \\"Tri Martolod\\". Although Stivell sued Manau for the unauthorised sampling, the group claimed that they had modified the original sufficiently, through the addition of lyrics and other changes, to avoid any charges of plagiarism. Stivell is now credited for a part of \\"La Tribu de Dana\\"'s arrangements. Stivell's CD album Again in 1993 was the base for a new wave of his popularity, especially in France and Brittany. Other albums received good critical reviews, such as Brian Boru or 1 Douar (\\"1 Earth\\"). In 2002 Stivell released Au-del√† des mots (\\"Beyond Words\\"), his twenty-first LP. The album featured him playing six different harps, specially dedicated to the Celtic Harp Revival's 50th anniversary. In 2004, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Celtic harp revival in Brittany, he wrote a book in collaboration with Jean-No√´l Verdier: Telenn, la harpe bretonne (\\"Telenn, the Breton harp\\").Alain Stivell and Jean-No√´l Verdier. Telenn, la harpe bretonne. Le T√©l√©gramme 2004 The same year, a DVD, Parcours was published by Fox-Path√©. In 2006, a new CD album called Explore came out in France and other countries, distributed through Harmonia Mundi. The album explored fusions of Celtic music with electro-rock, raga and hip-hop with a unique and personal vocal style and an original mix of lyrics in Breton, English and French. Alan Stivell and Nolwenn Leroy performing \\"Brian Boru\\" at the Paris Olympia in 2012 In 2009, the title of his album Emerald celebrated his emerald anniversary with his fans (i.e. forty years together) and paid homage to the sea and the Celtic lands (color blue-green, Glaz in Breton language). In 2013, a new CD album and DVD called Olympia 40th Anniversary came out in France (Universal) as a result of the concert performed at the Olympia mythical music hall on 16 February 2012. On 2 October 2015 Stivell released a new CD album called AMzer: Seasons through WorldVillage in France (and other countries), his first one of the 2010s, coinciding with his career's 50th anniversary. The album is also available as a \\"Leclerc limited edition\\" including 3 bonus tracks (2 alternative mixes and a brand new instrumental) and a 60-page booklet.  Critical acclaim  Music critic Bruce Eder has stated: \\"[Alan Stivell's] harp recordings, with their enveloping lyricism and tightly interwoven patterns of variations, can appeal to more serious listeners of new age music. Stivell's main audience, however, lies with fans of Celtic music and culture, and English folk music. Embracing ancient and modern elements, but (apart from his folk-rock work) making no compromises to modern melodic sensibilities, his music captures the mystery and strangeness of Breton, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish landscapes that are both ageless and timeless. It is haunting, mysterious, and beautiful, with no equivalent in modern popular music and few peers in the realm of commercial folk music.\\"  Interviews  In the 1978 book Racines interdites (\\"Forbidden Roots\\"), a series of interviews with Stivell covers questions about the Breton language, history and geography, as well as his utopian vision of a world living in meditative harmony with nature. Lyrics for 17 of Stivell's songs are reprinted at the back of the book.Alan Stivell: Racines interdites, interviews conducted by Jacques Erwan and Marc Legras, \\"Musiques et Musiciens series\\", 1978  Legacy  Alan Stivell has influenced multiple contemporary artists, most notably folk metal band Eluveitie. Their biggest hit 'Inis Mona' shares a melody with the traditional Tri Martolod. Where it is played on bagpipes, tin whistle and hurdy-gurdy with the addition of harsh vocals, electric guitar, bass guitar and drums.

The degree may require a graduate thesis or dissertation at the level of a research doctorate such as a PhD.  North America  = Canada = Through the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), Engineers Canada accredits Canadian undergraduate engineering programs that meet the standards of the profession. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to pursue further training towards becoming a licensed professional engineer in Canada. The P.Eng license is the ultimate qualification for the practicing professional engineering in Canada. In Canada, A CEAB-accredited engineer degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a P.Eng (professional engineer) anywhere in Canada and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured. A graduate of a non- CEAB-accredited program must demonstrate that his or her education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program. = United States = In the United States, the engineer's degree requires a year of study beyond a master's degree or two years from a bachelor's degree and often includes a requirement for a research thesis. At the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School the thesis is required to be \\"more extensive and complete in problem scope and solution than a master's thesis\\", although \\"not necessarily meeting the test of original research and contribution to fundamental knowledge that is applied to PhD dissertations.\\" At UCLA, the engineer degree is explicitly set at the level of the preliminary PhD examination, i.e. not including the contribution to fundamental knowledge. The engineer's degree was originally a first degree at the same level as a bachelor's degree. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was empowered by its 1824 charter to award Civil Engineer and Topographical Engineer degrees alongside the Bachelor in Science, and awarded the first Civil Engineer degrees in 1835. Civil Engineer degrees were also awarded by Dartmouth College (from 1845), the University of Michigan (from 1855) and by Yale University (from 1860), while Columbia University awarded Engineer of Mines degrees from 1867. By the early 20th-century engineer's degrees were commonly at graduate level ‚Äì a survey by a committee of the Association of American Universities in 1916 found that this was the case in over two-thirds of the universities surveyed. The committee recommended that engineer's degrees be reserved for study beyond master's level.  Latin America  In Latin America, a degree or title of \\"Ingeniero\\" is awarded after completing five years of college. This may be translated as \\"Engineer\\", however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country's educational system and can be compared to a six-year post-master's degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state licence to legally practice in the field or a professional certification outside the academic environment. = Chile = In Chile, the educational system does not strictly follow that of the United States. University education is structured in four cycles, as Licenciatura (bachelor's degree), T√≠tulo Profesional (professional title), Mag√≠ster (master's degree) and Doctorado (doctorate or Ph.D). In this case, the engineer status is a general denomination for a person who has a professional title in engineering (T√≠tulo Profesional en Ingenier√≠a). The title is obtained after six years of study; in this way including a bachelor's degree in science, which is obtained after four years of study. As in other countries, students only need to obtain the bachelor's degree to enter a master's degree or doctoral program, which commonly take two and three years, respectively. Since a professional title will take six years of study, after obtaining this title the graduate can enroll directly into a doctoral degree. In this manner, the international academic equivalence of a professional title in Chile corresponds to a six-year post-master's degree. = Mexico = In Mexico, the educational system follows closely that of the United States. University education is structured in three cycles, as Licenciatura (bachelor's degree), Maestr√≠a (master's degree) and Doctorado (doctorate). The Ingeniero (Engineer) degree is awarded depending on the nature of the studies pursued. In order to be called an Engineer, one must have passed certain courses related to engineering and been awarded a professional credential (c√©dula profesional) that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional credential (c√©dula profesional) in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession. For engineering, completing all taught courses of a Licenciatura does not automatically award the graduate the title and licence of Ingeniero; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix Ingenier√≠a attached to the name of the degree. It is the case that many people finish all courses in an engineering program, they obtain the diploma and title of Engineer and the professional credential, after getting their professional credential (c√©dula profesional). Degrees in engineering require four to five years to complete. After this, the graduate may enroll in a postgraduate program, such as a master's degree or in exceptional cases, directly into a doctoral degree.  Europe (prior to the Bologna Process)  Prior to the Bologna Process, In most countries of continental Europe, universities specializing in technical fields have traditionally awarded their students an engineer's degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing secondary education and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a doctorate. Following German custom in higher education, the engineer's degree is called Diplom. In addition to Germany itself, this system was common in states like Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. = Belgium = In Belgium, there are three types of engineering degrees: * \\"Burgerlijk Ingenieur\\" / \\"Ing√©nieur civil\\" or \\"Master of Science in Engineering\\" (abbrev. \\"ir.\\") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.), delivered by universities. * \\"Bio-ingenieur\\" / \\"Bioing√©nieur\\" or \\"Master of Science in Bioscience Engineering\\" (abbrev. \\"ir.\\") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.), delivered by universities. * \\"Industrieel Ingenieur\\" / \\"Ing√©nieur industriel\\" or \\"Master of Science in Engineering Technology\\" (abbrev. \\"Ing.\\") - five years study in French Community of Belgium (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.) or four years of study in the Flemish Community of Belgium (3 BSc. + 1 MSc.), delivered by universities. Names are traditionally prefixed with the ir. and/or Ing. titles, although this practice is not as widespread as in the Netherlands. Use of these titles is regulated and protected by law. Belgium is particularly noteworthy as having a system under which demands made on students of engineering are particularly severe. = Belarus and Ukraine = In Belarus and Ukraine, the degree is —Å–ø–µ—Ü—ñ–∞–ª—ñ—Å—Ç —ñ–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä (specialist inzhener), a first degree after five years of study. = Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Ex- Yugoslavia = In Croatia, the old system included the engineer's degrees diplomirani in≈æenjer (abbr. dipl.ing.) which was awarded by university faculties and a lower ranked engineer's degree in≈æenjer (abbr. ing.) which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the Netherlands. The old dipl.ing. degree could later be upgraded to a magistar (abbr. mr., Magister degree) and then a doktor (abbr. dr., Doctorate). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of Yugoslavia. In Serbian, the abbreviation is dipl.in≈æ.Ivan Klajn, Reƒçnik jeziƒçkih nedoumica (NOLIT, Beograd) Serbian titles of magistar (abbr. mr, Magister degree) and doktor (abbr. dr, Doctorate) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end. = Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia = In the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer's degree is called in≈ºynier (Polish), in≈æinier (Slovak) or in≈æen√Ωr (Czech) and the abbreviation is in≈º. in Poland and Ing. in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which may be written before the person's name. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the degree of Ing. is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a Master of Science in Engineering. In Poland, the degree of in≈ºynier is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the licencjat in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A magister in≈ºynier (abbreviated mgr in≈º.) refers to a Master of Science in Engineering, after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were \\"in≈ºynier\\" studies that lasted for four years and afterward one could obtain the \\"magister\\" title in two years of studies‚Äîthe total of six years resulted in two degrees, \\"magister\\" and \\"in≈ºynier\\". In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the \\"magister in≈ºynier\\" five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the \\"magister in≈ºynier\\" (mgr in≈º. before the name) was the equivalent degree with \\"in≈ºynier\\" designating the professional level and \\"magister\\" designating the academic level. After the Bologna process the first level is \\"in≈ºynier,\\" obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before and \\"masters\\" after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that \\"magister in≈ºynier\\" be made a basis for professional rights. = Finland = In Finnish, the engineer's degree is called diplomi-insin√∂√∂ri and abbreviated dipl.ins., DI or M.Sc.(Tech.). It is possible to obtain after five years of studying or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate tekniikan kandidaatti (B.Sc.(Tech.)) degree. The degree of insin√∂√∂ri (AMK) is a bachelor's degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (ammattikorkeakoulu), similar to a German Fachhochschule, but it is not interchangeable with the academic tekniikan kandidaatti. Due to the Bologna process, a new master's degree called insin√∂√∂ri (ylempi AMK) or \\"engineer (higher amk)\\" has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of insin√∂√∂ri (AMK) and further studies. = France = In France, there are two main ways to become an engineer: * Have a Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur, delivered by the French grandes √©coles in engineering. * Have a master's degree in science, delivered by public universities. The Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur is a postgraduate degree in engineering usually awarded by the French grandes √©coles in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French baccalaur√©at. Each holder of the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur is conferred the title of ing√©nieur dipl√¥m√© (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term ing√©nieur (engineer) which is less-regulated. The dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur is recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States and in the countries of the European Union (also in France). Most grandes √©coles give the opportunity to their students to join a double degree with a University (in France or abroad). Furthermore, Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur graduates can pursue a selective PhD after their engineering studies to later join academia or an industrial R&D; department. Any institution issuing the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur must be accredited by the Commission des Titres d'Ing√©nieur. France is particular in that it is mainly the grandes √©coles in engineering that are accredited and are certified to issue the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (universit√©s). Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc.) with a large student body. On the other hand, grandes √©coles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with more selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide). = Germany and Austria = In German, the traditional engineer's degree is called Diplom-Ingenieur (Dipl.-Ing., in Austria DI is also used). This supersedes \\"Ing. (Grad)\\", the old form in Germany. This degree is generally equivalent to a Master's degree, which is not to be confused with the old Magister degree. Most programs that used to lead to a Dipl.-Ing. degree lead to master's degrees today, as the Diplom-Ingenieur as an academic title is phased out because of the Bologna Process. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a Dipl.-Ing. with the newly introduced M.Sc. degrees. The German \\"Universities of Applied Sciences\\" (Fachhochschule) award the traditional engineering degree Diplom-Ingenieur (FH) (Dipl.-Ing. (FH)). A requirement for the degree is to write a Diplom thesis. This is also being modified by the Bologna Process, as bachelor's and master's degrees from a University of Applied Sciences are equal to degrees from a traditional university.Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 07.02.2008) Universities of Applied Sciences were phased out and, despite some retaining the term \\"Applied Sciences\\", have been reorganized into universities with their own faculties and research institutes. These universities are often strongly focused on fields such as computer science, engineering or business schools. Subjects like Law or Human Medicine etc. which requires a Staatsexamen (state exam) can only be studied at traditional universities. Since 2009, most Universities in Germany offer bachelor's degree programmes (B.Sc., B.Eng., M.Sc., M.Eng, M.C.A. and others) and Master programmes that lead to the academic degree Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others. In Austria there also exists the Ingenieur (respectively Ing.). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of a so-called HTL (H√∂here Technische Lehranstalt) which is a high school with a very technical background. Graduates of these schools are allowed to start their studies at universities. The title Ingenieur (Ing.) could only be obtained after proof of at least three years of practice, which requires higher technical knowledge in the field of education. With a revision of the Austrian engineer's law (Ingenieurgesetz 2017Ingenieurgesetz 2017 BGBl. I Nr. 23/2017) in May 2017, the requirements of the conferment of the degree were tightened. Next to the existing requirements for graduation from a technical high school (HTL) and verifiable practical experience of three years, the applicant must take an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. As a result, the degree was included in the National Qualifications Framework on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor's degree. The engineering degree does not meet the requirements to enter a master's program in Austria. = Greece = In Greece, the title of \\"Engineer\\" is awarded by higher education institutions. There are two types of engineer. The title \\"Diplomate Engineer\\" (Diplomate in Greek: ŒîŒπœÄŒªœâŒºŒ±œÑŒøœçœáŒøœÇ; KŒ¨œÑŒøœáŒøœÇ ŒµŒΩœåœÇ ŒîŒπœÄŒªœéŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ/ŒîŒØœÄŒªœâŒºŒ±/Diploma; Diploma holder) is awarded after completion of a five-year undergraduate engineering degree (diploma) programme at a polytechnic university. These degrees are 300 ECTS credits, leading to a qualification at ISCED level 7, equivalent to an integrated master's degree. The title of \\"Technologist Engineer\\", is awarded after completion of a four- year (three and a half years from 1983 to 1995) undergraduate engineering degree programme at a technological educational institute (TEI). These are 240 (previously 210, 1983‚Äì1995) ECTS credits leading to an award at ISCED level 6, equivalent to a bachelor's degree. TEIs existed from 1983 to 2019; they were reformed between 2013 and 2019 and their departments incorporated into existing higher education institutions. = Italy = In Italy until 2001 there were two degrees: a three-year diploma in ingegneria (BEng level, title abbrev. \\"dipl. ing.\\") and a five-year laurea in ingegneria (MEng level, title abbrev. \\"ing.\\"). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor's level is called laurea (abbrev. \\"L\\") and master's degree level is called laurea specialistica or laurea magistrale (abbrev. \\"LS\\"). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called laurea in ingegneria (BEng level) and the title of dottore in Ingegneria (abbrev. \\"dott.\\") can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called laurea magistrale in ingegneria (MEng level) and the title of dottore magistrale in Ingegneria (abbrev. \\"dott.\\") can be obtained. After a \\"state exam\\" one becomes \\"Ingegnere\\" (abbrev. Ing). In Italy the state accreditation system, degrees and titles are regulated by state law. See regulations (in Italian) DM 4 Agosto 2000 for \\"laurea\\" (bachelor) and DM 28 Novembre 2000 for \\"laurea specialistica\\" (BEng (Hon)-master). Chartered professions (including engineering) are regulated by state law 328/01 (\\"D.P.R. 5 giugno 2001, n. 328\\"). = The Netherlands = In the Netherlands, somebody holding an engineer's degree is an ingenieur. There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations: * ir. is obtained by university graduates (Wetenschappelijk onderwijs or WO). It is the highest engineer qualification. - five years study (3 B.Sc. + 2 M.Sc.) * ing. is obtained by graduates from polytechnics (hoger beroeps onderwijs or HBO). - four years study (4 B.Eng. or B.ASc.) Names are traditionally prefixed with the ir. or ing. titles. Use of these titles is regulated and protected by Dutch law.\\"Artikel 435 lid 3 Wetboek van strafrecht\\" (in Dutch) Under the Bologna agreement, the titles are increasingly interchanged with the English-language degrees (B.Sc., BBE, M.Sc., etc.). Completion of Dutch engineering qualifications has historically demanded a lot of effort. On average the five-year course takes seven years to finish.\\"Opleidingen met een zogenoemd 'zwaar wiskundig profiel' als Bouwkunde, Econometrie en Elektrotechniek zorgen voor de meeste vertraging bij wo- studenten\\" (in Dutch)\\"Vooral bij techniek, industrie en bouwkunde is de wo- studieduur veel langer\\" (in Dutch) = Portugal = In Portugal, Engineer (, feminine: engenheira, abrev.: eng.) is a professional degree reserved for the effective members of the Portuguese Institution of the Engineers (OE, Ordem dos Engenheiros) and Portuguese Institution of Technical Engineers (OET, Ordem dos Engenheiros T√©cnicos). There is not an academic degree of engenheiro, despite the title being used informally to refer to anyone who has a degree in engineering, even a nonmember of the OE or OET. Until the Bologna Process, having a licenciado (five-year) degree in engineering was a previous condition to be able to be admitted to the OE. Presently, admission to the OE requires a post-Bologna licenciado (3 years) degree or a mestre (five-year) master in engineering. OE members holders of a post-Bologna licenciado degree are now classified as E1 grade engineers, while holders of a pre-Bologna licenciado or a mestre are classified as E2 grade engineers. = Romania and Republic of Moldova = Romania and Republic of Moldova followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called Diploma de inginer and the graduate was called a Inginer diplomat. These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master (M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (examen de diploma). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called Diploma de Sub-inginer which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the Bologna process, the graduates obtain the Inginer licentiat degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the Inginer Master degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program. = Spain = The situation in Spain is very similar to France but without the grandes √©coles and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the Proyecto de Fin de Carrera (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is Ingeniero (Engineer) or other degree called Ingeniero T√©cnico (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field; however, certain engineering professions require by law a master's degree in their respective field, a degree called \\"master habilitante\\" or \\"habilitating master's degree\\".\\"Real Decreto 1837/2008, de 8 de noviembre, por el que se incorporan al ordenamiento jur√≠dico espa√±ol la Directiva 2005/36/CE, del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo, de 7 de septiembre de 2005, y la Directiva 2006/100/CE, del Consejo, de 20 de noviembre de 2006, relativas al reconocimiento de cualificaciones profesionales, as√≠ como a determinados aspectos del ejercicio de la profesi√≥n de abogado.\\" A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.\\"National systems of engineering education, QA and accreditation\\" , TREE ‚Äì Teaching and Research in Engineering in Europe = Sweden = There are two different engineering degrees that belong to the so called professional degrees: civilingenj√∂r (Master of Science in Engineering), which requires five years of study and h√∂gskoleingenj√∂r (Bachelor of Science in Engineering), which amounts to three years. Both programmes admit students directly from secondary education. = United Kingdom = The highest engineer qualification in the UK and Ireland is the Chartered Engineer (C.Eng) which is a minimum of eight years but usually 12 years of education, training and professional peer reviewed practice process. Chartered Engineer is a terminal qualification. The academic qualification, which is minimum for gaining chartership in engineering, is the Master of Engineering (MEng) or BEng plus MSc or MA in addition to four to six years peer-reviewed professional practice including a project report / thesis. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales this is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer to the MEng. The City and Guilds of London Institute have established a recognised route to higher engineering qualifications with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). CGLI has align the Graduate Diploma (level 6) and Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) with the registration requirements for Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer status. The Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng and its Postgraduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British MEng. UK Professional institutions have delegated authority from the engineering council to approve university degrees and also award the Chartered Engineer qualification in a specific discipline. For example, IMechE awards C.Eng, MIMechE, ICE awards CEng, MICE and IET awards CEng, MIET. Engineers who have been awarded a BEng (Ordinary) or BEng (Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the workplace are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng), if the qualification has been accepted for this classification, by the engineering council. If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of postgraduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of four to eight years in practice for a total of eight to 12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured postgraduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development programme administered by IMechE enables the engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.[5] Uniquely the Institution of Structural Engineers requires candidates for chartered status to undertake both a professional review interview and a seven-hour written examination. The examination tests the candidates' ability to demonstrate:- * An understanding of structural engineering principles * An ability to initiate and communicate structural design * An ability to provide effective and viable solutions to a structural design problem Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are similar but not equivalent to North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. The UK and North American system of regulating engineering professional qualifications is very different and not equivalent. In the US and Canada engineering is a regulated profession in terms of practice and enforced by law and licensing. It is more than the regulation of engineering titles‚Äîlike the UK. This means that many UK chartered Engineers who are grandfathered to the title or are non degree holders (HNC/HND) will not be recognized formally as professional engineers in Canada and US. There is strict interpretation of qualifications and education because there are legal implications. There is no back door entry or experiential exemption from the formal academic requirements. This is simply because of the legal legislation on practice. This licensed based engineering governance legal framework does not exist in the UK. MIET-Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology is recognised as regulated engineering profession by virtue of the Statutory Instruments n.2007/2781-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2007-Directive European Union 2005/36/EC. This meaning retains the 19th century idea that \\"real\\" engineers were military personnel, while \\"other\\" engineers were civilians.  Europe (according to the Bologna Process)  Following the introduction of the Bologna process, universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year bachelor's degree, a one to two-year master's degree and a doctoral degree. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the bachelor's degree (baccalaureus, three to four years) and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer's degree or a master's degree (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single 'integrated' degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland). But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor's) and second (master's) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum. Most traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year Civilingenj√∂r in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor's and master's degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the civilingenj√∂r degree. In France, an important part of engineering is taught in √©coles d‚Äôing√©nieurs, which are part of the French grandes √©coles system. Since the Bologna Process, the Dipl√¥me d‚Äôing√©nieur is officially considered to be at the level of a master's degree. Notably, Europe has the international professional engineering qualification and title of European Engineer (EUR ING) which is obtained through peer review after seven years of education, training and professional experience.  Russia  As of 2012 in Russia, following degrees correspond to the \\"engineer's degree\\" in the sense of this article: * –ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä - \\"engineer\\", which was formerly awarded after four, five, six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as \\"mining engineer\\" or \\"systems engineer\\". * –ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä –ø–æ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ - \\"engineer at specialty\\" (where specialty's name is mentioned), currently awarded after five or six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as \\"engineer- ecologist at specialty Rational usage of natural resources and protection of the environment\\" * –ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä-–∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å –ø–æ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ - \\"engineer- researcher at specialty\\" (where specialty's name is mentioned), was formerly awarded after seven years of study * –ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–∞–≤—Ä –ø–æ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é - \\"bachelor at area\\" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after four years of study and \\"area\\" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former \\"specialties\\" * –ú–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä –ø–æ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é - \\"magister (master) at area\\" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after two years of study to those already having any higher-education degree and \\"area\\" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former \\"specialties\\" Anything but \\"bachelor\\" is considered \\"second-level\\" higher education and gives access to postgraduate education for \\"candidate of sciences\\" degree, \\"bachelor\\" is considered \\"first-level\\" higher education degree and gives access to study for master's (magister) degree. Post-graduate scientific degrees in engineering areas include –∫–∞–Ω–¥–∏–¥–∞—Ç —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫ - \\"candidate of technical sciences\\" and –¥–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫ - \\"doctor of technical sciences\\". Sometimes in English translations \\"...of technical sciences\\" is exchanged for \\"...of engineering\\".  Turkey  In Turkey, typical length of study for bachelor's degree at any engineering program is four years. Owner of a valid degree which is given by an engineering faculty at Turkish universities, can be called M√ºhendis, meaning \\"Engineers\\". The \\"M√ºhendis\\" title is limited by law to people with a valid engineering degree and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal. (Law No: 3458 Law about Engineers and Architects 28.06.1938 Publish no:3945) A person may earn a master's degree in the same field as the bachelor's and be called as \\"Y√ºksek M√ºhendis\\" (meaning Higher Engineer). Most Turkish engineering programs are accredited to European system by Bologna process.  Asia  = Bangladesh = In Bangladesh, the engineering degree is referred to as BSc Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) at the undergraduate level. Likewise, a master's degree is referred to as Master of Engineering (M.Engg.) and Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.). At the undergraduate level, the course takes four years, only except being in the case of Urban and Regional Planning discipline, where it usually takes five years. In postgraduate education, pursuing a master's degree in any engineering discipline usually takes one to one and a half years. Graduated engineers who are members of either Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB) or Institution of Textile Engineers and Technologists (ITET) are legally and formally allowed to use the title \\"Engr.\\" before their names. = India = The engineering courses in India are regulated and set up under the aegis of the University Grants Commission of India (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). In India, engineering qualifications include the following: * Bachelor's degrees (four years after class 12 and three years after Diploma in Engineering): BE (Bachelor of Engineering) and BTech (Bachelor of Technology). Both are same. Admission is usually through an engineering entrance examination. * Master's degrees (two or more years after BE and BTech): ME (Master of Engineering), MTech (Master of Technology) and MSc (Eng) (Master of Science in Engineering). Admission usually requires qualification in the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering or some work experience in an engineering field. The MTech and ME degrees are same and of two years' duration. MTech/ME usually has coursework in the first year and a project in the second year. The MSc (Eng) degree is usually research oriented and may requires two or more years to complete. * Doctoral degrees (three to five years): PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). Admission requirements vary across universities but usually include a master's degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in engineering with an exceptionally good academic record. = Pakistan = In Pakistan, engineering qualifications include the following: * BE (Bachelor of Engineering) or BS/BSc Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) - four years' duration. * ME (Master of Engineering) or MS/MSc Engineering (Master of Science in Engineering) - 1.5 to 2 years' duration. * PhD (Engineering) - minimum three years' duration. Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession. PEC is a full signatory of Washington Accordhttp://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/ and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).http://www.ieagreements.org/agreements/ipea/members/ = Vietnam = In Vietnam, the engineer's degree is called B·∫±ng k·ªπ s∆∞, the first degree after five years of study. The Ministry of Education of Vietnam has also issued separate regulations for the naming of degrees not in accordance with international regulation. The Engineer's degree is named \\"The Degree of Engineer\\" in the degree (e.g. The Degree of Engineer in Information Technology). Since 30/12/2019, The Degree of Engineer, Doctor and architecture has been classified at 7th rank, it means having the same rank with a master's degree.

A color commentator or expert commentator is a sports commentator who assists the play-by-play commentator, typically by filling in when play is not in progress. The phrase \\"color commentator\\" is primarily used in American English; the person may be referred to as a summariser (outside North America) or analyst (a term used throughout the English-speaking world). The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the main commentator is not describing the action. The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy, and injury reports on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast. The term color refers to levity and insight provided by a secondary announcer. A sports color commentator customarily works alongside the play-by-play broadcaster. Variations =Canada and the United States= Commentary teams typically feature one professional commentator describing the passage of play, and another, usually a former player or coach, providing supplementary input as the game progresses. The color commentator will usually restrict his input to periods when the ball or puck is out of play or there is no significant action on the field and will defer to the main commentator whenever there is a shot on goal or other significant event, sometimes resulting in their being talked- over or cut short by the primary commentator. Additionally, former players and managers appear as pundits, carrying out a similar role to the co-commentator during the pre-game show preceding a given contest and the post-game show following it. In American motorsports coverage, there may be as many as two color commentators in the booth for a given broadcast. A rules analyst, typically a former official, may comment on rules enforcement and replays. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the role of \\"color commentator\\" is largely unknown; the equivalent role is usually called \\"summariser\\" but also known as \\"analyst\\", \\"pundit\\", or simply \\"co-commentator\\". Cricket coverage on ESPNcricinfo uses similar terminology. =Australia= The term is not used in Australia. Those giving the analysis alongside the main commentator are sometimes said to be giving additional or expert analysis, or \\"special comments\\", or may be referred to as \\"expert commentators\\". =Latin America= For soccer broadcasts on Latin American sports television channels, this type of commentator is called a comentarista in both Spanish and Portuguese, in contrast with the narrador, locutor (Portuguese) or relator (Spanish) who leads the transmission.

Ca√≠n, and used Guillermo Cain for the screenplay of the cult classic film Vanishing Point (1971). A one-time supporter of the politics of Fidel Castro, Cabrera Infante went into exile to London in 1965. He is best known for the novel Tres tristes tigres (literally: \\"three sad tigers\\", published in English as Three Trapped Tigers), which has been compared favorably to James Joyce's Ulysses.  Biography  Born in Gibara in Cuba's former Oriente Province (now part of Holgu√≠n Province), in 1941 he moved with his parents, to Havana, which would be the setting of nearly all of his writings other than his critical works. His parents were founding members of the Cuban Communist Party. Originally he intended to become a physician, but abandoned that in favor of writing and his passion for the cinema. Starting in 1950, he studied journalism at the University of Havana.An Interview with Guillermo Cabrera Infante Center for book culture An appreciation of Guillermo Cabrera Infante by Dionisio D. Martinez Under the Batista regime he was arrested and fined in 1952 for publishing a short story which included several English-language profanities. His opposition to Batista later cost him a short jail term. He married for the first time in 1953. From 1954 to 1960 he wrote film reviews for the magazine Carteles, using the pseudonym G. Ca√≠n; he became its editor in chief, still pseudonymously, in 1957. With the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 he was named director of the Instituto del Cine. He was also head of the literary magazine Lunes de Revoluci√≥n, a supplement to the Communist newspaper Revoluci√≥n; however, this supplement was prohibited in 1961 by Fidel Castro. He divorced in 1961 and in the same year married his second wife, Miriam Gomez, an actress. Having fallen somewhat out of favor with the Castro regime (the government's ban on a documentary on Havana nightlife made by his brother led to his being forbidden to publish in Cuba), he served from 1962 to 1965 in Brussels, Belgium, as a cultural attach√©. During this time, his sentiments turned against the Castro regime; after returning to Cuba for his mother's funeral in 1965, he went into exile, first in Madrid, then in London. In 1966 he published Tres tristes tigres, a highly experimental, Joycean novel, playful and rich in literary allusions, which intended to do for Cuban Spanish what Mark Twain had done for American English, recording the great variety of its colloquial variations. It won the 1964 Premio Biblioteca Breve for best unpublished novel. He co-wrote the script for Richard C. Sarafian's 1971 cult film Vanishing Point under the pseudonym Guillermo Ca√≠n. Although he is considered a part of the famed \\"Latin American Boom\\" generation of writers that includes his contemporary Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, he disdained the label. Ever an iconoclast, he even rejected the label \\"novel\\" for his masterpieces, such as Tres tristes tigres and La Habana para un infante difunto. He was influential to Puerto Rican and Cuban writers such as Luis Rafael S√°nchez (La guaracha del Macho Camacho) and Fernando Vel√°zquez Medina (√öltima rumba en La Habana). In 1997 he received the Premio Cervantes, presented to him by King Juan Carlos of Spain. He died on February 21, 2005, in London, of sepsis. He had two daughters from his first marriage.

A squirrel being successfully lifted Squirrel fishing is the sporting practice of \\"catching\\" squirrels and attempting to lift them into the air using a nut (preferably a peanut) tied to a string or fishing line, and optionally some kind of fishing pole. There has been some debate over where modern squirrel fishing originated. Avon Lake natives Bob Kish and Greg Pavlovcic brought the sport to The Ohio State University in 1988 when they fished out their dorm room window in Siebert Hall on South Campus their freshman year. Both Kish and Pavlovcic had a net ready, in the event a squirrel was successfully captured. Neither man had truly contemplated what they would have done with a captured squirrel in their dorm room. The practice was popularized by Nicholas Middleton and Zmira Zilkha during their summers at Middlebury College Italian Language School, by Nikolas Gloy and Yasuhiro Endo at the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, and by the Berkeley Squirrel Fisher's Club (BSF), an official student group at the University of California, Berkeley, that has been featured in the campus newspaper. , Ohio State University also had a squirrel fishing club. Michigan State University was late to join in 2015. Squirrel fishing occurred at least as early as 1889 in the United States.

Overview Quinn focused on various traditional aspects of Irish culture and argued for their non-Celtic nature. One aspect he stressed is the role of sailing in Connemara society, where his films were made, Quinn investigated the history of the Atlantic sea lanes from the Baltic Sea, Ireland, Britain, as far south as the Mediterranean and North Africa. Quinn suggested that Ireland's first inhabitants came by boat sometime after the end of the last ice age ‚Äì probably from the warmer, more populous south. As navigation gave rise to coastal settlement over long periods of time, overseas trade and cultural exchanges continued until at least the North African pirates of the 17th century. These connections can be seen in ship building styles and sailing techniques, for example in similarities between the Galway P√∫c√°n and the Arab Dhow. Another aspect focused on by Quinn is the Sean N√≥s or Old Style of Irish song and dance. The non-European feel of Sean N√≥s singing in particular has often been commented upon. Quinn originally proposed a North African origin for Sean N√≥s, but later agreed that it is shared by the Tatars of Tatarstan, thus an archetypal musical form older than the Book of Kells. The Irish language, music and art is related to ancient Iberian, Mediterranean and North African culture, in particular the indigenous Berbers of North Africa. According to Quinn, the idea of \\"Celtic\\" origins was a Greek term ‚Äì Keltoi (ŒöŒµŒªœÑŒøŒØ) ‚Äì used to describe any \\"barbarian\\" who was not Greek. The Romans perpetuated the slur until 1707 when Edward Lluyd resurrected it as a compliment. It was taken for granted by Anglo-Irish antiquarians who found it a useful way of distinguishing themselves not only from the English but from the \\"mere Irish\\". The term also developed untermensch resonances (see Matthew Arnold). Bob Quinn developed these ideas into a book: The Atlantean Irish: Ireland's oriental and maritime heritage. Barry Cunliffe, distinguished Professor Emeritus of European Archaeology and author of Facing the Ocean (2001) wrote the introduction to Quinn's Atlantean Irish'.' Evidence The 'Celtic' Origin of the Irish has long been questioned by archaeologists. In recent years, the discovery of mitochondrial DNA has been used as a method to map the historical migration of mankind's genetic groups. Such genetic tests, conducted in Ireland in 2004, seemed to confirm that the theory of Celtic origins of Ireland's population was genetically unfounded but recent advances in genetic testing (especially recent Ancient DNA findings) are giving an almost opposite picture from the older testing interpretations. In earlier tests, Bryan Sykes, genetic scientist and author of bestseller The Seven Daughters of Eve, while analysing European DNA groups identified what he called the \\"Clan of Tara\\" ‚Äì a genetic group that originated in what is now Tuscany, Italy 17,000 years ago during the Ice Age and that spread along the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic seaboards of continental Europe, Ireland and Western Britain. Bryan Sykes The Seven Daughters of Eve, pp299-308, London, 2001 Sykes did not conduct genetic tests in North Africa amongst Berbers. Criticisms The Atlantean thesis has not generally been accepted by the Irish academic establishment, who have criticised Bob Quinn for his alleged lack of scholarly methodology and the absence of hard evidence to back his theories. Quinn's response to this is to assert that traditional landlubber methods of scholarship ignore the maritime dimension of Irish history and can fail to recognise the deeper, more intuitive links that may exist between cultures and countries. He also asserts that a close-minded, elitist attitude among academics prevents a more sympathetic appraisal of his work. More controversially, he maintains that critics of his work are guilty of an unconscious racism, or in his own words, of being afraid of the idea that Irish people might have 'a touch of the tar' about them.Really Bob, have we all got a 'touch of the tar' in us?, Cathal MacCarthy, Irish Independent, Sunday September 03 2006 References Further reading *Bob Quinn (2005).

Ceolt√≥ir√≠ is the Irish word for musicians, and Cualann is the name of an area just outside Dublin where √ì Riada lived. √ì Riada's work with Ceolt√≥ir√≠ Chualann is credited with revitalizing the use of the bodhr√°n as a percussion instrument in Celtic music. In 1960 √ì Riada was looking for musicians to perform music for the play \\"The Song of the Anvil\\" by Bryan MacMahon. Paddy Moloney, at the age of 20, was called to participate in the project, along with his friend Sean Potts on tin whistle, Sonny Brogan on accordion and John Kelly on fiddle. They rehearsed weekly in √ì Riada's house in Galloping Green, on the outskirts of Dublin. Following its success, √ì Riada had the idea of forming Ceolt√≥ir√≠ Chualann, a band to play traditional Irish songs with accompaniment and traditional dance tunes and slow airs, arranged with instruments: harpsichord, bodhran, piano, fiddle, accordions, flute, pipes and whistles. The idea of actually arranging folk music, or dance music, had been done on at least one or two 78rpm recordings in the past, but they were folk tunes done in a classical way, highly orchestrated.Fiddler Magazine - Winter 1997/1998 Another aim was to revitalize the work of blind harpist and composer Turlough O'Carolan.Ceolt√≥iri Cualann The band was launched during the Dublin Theatre Festival in September 1960, at the Shelbourne Hotel, at an event called Reacaireacht an Riadaigh (√ì Riada's Recital). Included in the program were traditional singers, writer Se√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in and poet Se√°n √ì Tuama. In March of the following year √ì Riada recorded the first of a series of radio programmes for which he retained the name Reacaireacht an Riadaigh, and included music played by Ceolt√≥ir√≠ Chualann. Soon after the band's formation, Peadar Mercier and Se√°n Keane joined. Ceolt√≥ir√≠ Chualann continued to play until 1969. Their music was featured in the 1968 documentary, The Village, by Mark McCarty (director) and Paul Hockings (anthropologist). During 1969 they recorded two albums, √ì Riada and √ì Riada Sa Gaiety. The latter of those two albums was not released until after 1971, when Se√°n √ì Riada died.

For other proposed bills of the same name, see Succession to the Crown Bill The Succession to the Crown Bill was a British Private Member's Bill aimed at reforming the manner of succession to the British monarchy published in the House of Lords by Labour peer Lord Dubs on 9 December 2004, and withdrawn by him on 14 January 2005, after the Government said that it would block the Bill. It would have involved three major measures: firstly, the change of the form of primogeniture used from male-preference to gender-neutral (absolute) primogeniture‚Äîthat is, that the eldest child would succeed regardless of gender; secondly, that the Acts of Union 1707, both in Scotland and in England, as well as other relevant legislation, be altered to remove the clauses forbidding the monarch or heirs from marrying any Catholic; and, thirdly, the revocation of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which requires descendants of King George II (other than descendants of princesses who married foreigners) to obtain the Sovereign's consent to marry. However, the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701, barring the monarch from being Catholic, would have still remained in force. The most immediate effect of the Bill passing and becoming law would have been the moving of Princess Anne from her then position of ninth on the line of succession to the British throne to fourth, displacing Prince Andrew, Duke of York. It was unclear as to how the Bill would have affected the line of succession in the other 15 Commonwealth realms as it explicitly applied to the United Kingdom only. The Bill drew on the recommendations of the Fabian Society's Commission on the Future of the Monarchy, which reported in 2003. Lord Dubs is a member of the Fabian Society's Executive Committee.

An alarm signal is a response produced by an individual, the ‚Äúsender‚Äù, reacting to a hazard that warns other animals, the receivers, of danger.(Smith 1992). This chemical alarm signal is only released when the sender incurs mechanical damage, such as when it has been caught by a predator, and is detected by the olfactory system. When this signal reaches the receivers, they perceive a greater predation risk and exhibit an antipredator response. Since populations of fish exhibiting this trait survive more successfully, the trait is maintained via natural selection. While the evolution of this signal was once a topic of great debate, recent evidence suggests schreckstoff evolved as a defense against environmental stressors such as pathogens, parasites, and UVB radiation and that it was later co-opted by predators and prey as a chemical signal. Background Chemical alarm systems have been identified in a number of different taxa, including gastropods,(Stenzler and Atema 1997; Atema and Stenzler 1977) echinoderms,(Snyder and Snyder 1970) amphibians(Hews and Blaustein 1985; Hews 1998; Lutterschmidt et al. 1994) and fishes. One of the most well-studied chemical alarm signals is schreckstoff, the use of which is widespread in the superorder Ostariophysi (e.g., minnows, characins, catfishes, etc.). About 64% of all freshwater fish species and 27% of all fish species worldwide are found in the ostariophysan superorder, which highlights the widespread use and importance of this chemical alarm system in fishes.(Nelson 1994). Schreckstoff in ostariophysans The production of schreckstoff has been shown to be metabolically expensive and is therefore part of a conditional strategy that can only be employed by individuals with access to sufficient resources.(Wisenden and Smith 1998). One putative active ingredient in schreckstoff is hypoxanthine-3N-oxide (H3NO), which may be produced in club cells which will henceforth be referred to as \\"alarm substance cells\\".(Argentini 1976; Pfeiffer 1982). The nitrogen oxide functional group was found to be the main chemical trigger of antipredator behavior in receivers.Brown et al. (2000) Schreckstoff is a mixture, and fragments of a glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, are able to trigger fear responses.Mathuru et al. (2012) The precursor polysaccharide is a component of mucus, and fragments are proposed to be produced during injury. Like schreckstoff obtained from skin extract, chondroitin sulfate activates a subset of olfactory sensory neurons. Production of and responses to schreckstoff change over the course of ontogeny. For example, young brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) are more likely to be caught in minnow traps that have been baited with conspecific skin extracts than adults.(Chivers and Smith 1994). This result indicates young brook sticklebacks do not make the association between schreckstoff and the potential presence of a predator as readily as adults. Whether this association strengthens over time as a result of learning or physiological development remains unclear.(Chivers and Smith 1994). In addition to changes across ontogeny, the degree to which schreckstoff is produced varies within the breeding season. Male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) cease production of schreckstoff during the breeding season, but still exhibit antipredator behaviors in response to schreckstoff during this time.(Smith 1973). Schreckstoff production may be halted at this time because male fathead minnows often incur mechanical damage while building their nests. It would be detrimental to a male to produce schreckstoff while building a nest, as it would inadvertently repel females, thereby decreasing the likelihood of obtaining a mate. By ceasing schreckstoff production during the breeding season, males circumvent this problem. The cessation of alarm substance cell production appears to be controlled by androgens.(Smith 1973). Hypotheses for the evolution of schreckstoff A number of different hypotheses have been proposed for the evolution of schreckstoff.(see Smith 1992 for a review). The first hypothesis is that the evolution of schreckstoff has been driven by kin selection. Support for this hypothesis would include evidence that individuals live in groups of closely related kin and that the release of chemical alarm signals increases the likelihood that related individuals will avoid predation. The second hypothesis, predator attraction, suggests the release of schreckstoff may attract additional predators which will interfere with the predation event, increasing the likelihood that the prey will escape and survive the attack. This hypothesis assumes predators will be attracted to schreckstoff and will interfere with one another either through competition for the captured prey or through predation of one another. It additionally assumes, despite the fact that the prey has already incurred mechanical damage, it is possible for the prey to escape and recover from the attack. Testing and validating these assumptions would provide support for the predator attraction hypothesis. The third hypothesis proposes that schreckstoff has an immune function, providing protection against pathogens, parasites and/or UVB radiation. For this hypothesis to be supported, a correlation between alarm substance cell production and the presence of pathogens and parasites would need to be observed. Direct evidence that schreckstoff inhibits the growth of aquatic pathogens and parasites would provide additional support for the immunity hypothesis. Another hypothesis is that schreckstoff is a breakdown product of mucus and club cells, induced by injury. Selection for the alarm response is primarily at the level of the receiver. =Kin selection hypothesis= One of the first hypotheses for the evolution of schreckstoff centered on W.D. Hamilton‚Äôs theory of kin selection.(Hamilton 1963, 1964a, 1964b). Under the theory of kin selection, the sender of the chemical alarm signal would be willing to incur the costs of sending this signal if the benefits to related individuals were sufficiently high. In a situation where the sender of the signal is paying great costs (i.e., it releases the chemical alarm signal because it has incurred potentially mortal mechanical damage), the benefits to closely related kin would have to be great. Under the framework of kin selection, behaviors that are seemingly detrimental to the sender are selected because they benefit individuals that are likely to share alleles by common descent. In this way, the frequency of the sender's alleles in the next generation is increased by their presence in successful kin. To apply kin selection theory to the evolution of schreckstoff, a number of conditions must be met. First, evidence must exist for the release of schreckstoff by the sender confers benefiting the receivers. Second, it must be shown that individuals in the order Ostariophysi associate mainly with family members. If either of these two assumptions is violated, then the kin selection hypothesis would not be supported. Some evidence exists in support of the first assumption that the release of schreckstoff confers quantifiable advantages to the receivers of this chemical signal. A laboratory experimentMathis and Smith (1992) revealed that fathead minnows exposed to conspecific schreckstoff survived 39.5% longer than controls when placed in a tank with a predatory northern pike (Esox lucius). This finding suggests schreckstoff increases vigilance in receivers, resulting in a quicker reaction time following detection of the predator. The second assumption, that individuals in the order Ostariophysi associate with close family members, does not appear to be supported by empirical evidence. In shoals of European minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus), no difference in relatedness was found within and between shoals,Naish et al. (1993) indicating individuals are not associating more closely with relatives than nonrelatives. Shoal composition has not been examined in all members of the ostariophysan order, and shoals composed entirely of family members may yet be discovered. Nevertheless, the finding that schreckstoff production is maintained in a species where the function is clearly unrelated to kin benefits provides strong evidence against kin selection as a mechanism for the evolution of schreckstoff. Fathead minnows have also been found to produce fewer epidermal alarm substance cells (and therefore less schreckstoff) when in the presence of familiar shoalmates.(Wisenden and Smith 1998). The results of this study indicate one of two scenarios, neither of which is compatible with the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved by kin selection. First, if schreckstoff evolved by kin selection, more epidermal alarm substance cells would be expected to be produced in the presence of kin than nonkin. This means familiar shoalmates in fathead minnows should be closely related kin and schreckstoff production should be increased when in shoals with familiar individuals. The study did not find this to be the case.Wisenden and Smith (1998) Second, these results indicate individuals either do not associate with kin at all or production of schreckstoff varies depending on how familiar the focal fish is with the individuals with which it shoals. In conclusion, evidence does not support the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved because it bolstered the inclusive fitness of the sender through increased survival of kin. =Predator attractant hypothesis= The predator attractant hypothesis proposes that the main purpose of schreckstoff is to attract additional predators to the area.(Smith 1992). According to this hypothesis, additional predators will interact with the initial predator, and these interactions will provide the sender with an opportunity to escape. A number of conditions must be met to support this hypothesis. First, schreckstoff must attract predators. Second, subsequent predators must disrupt the predation event, thereby increasing the probability that the prey will escape. Third, the sender must be able to recover from the mechanical damage incurred during the predation event. A studyMathis et al. (1995) provides support for the first condition that the release of schreckstoff must attract predators. This experiment revealed that schreckstoff extracted from the skin of fathead minnows attracted both northern pike (Esox lucius) and predatory diving beetles (Colymbetes sculptilis). Additionally, a natural study showed that predatory fish were seven times more likely to strike a lure baited with a sponge soaked in fathead minnow skin extract than a sponge soaked in either water or skin extract from a nonostariophysan convict cichlid (which presumably does not produce schreckstoff).(Wisenden and Thiel 2002). While the previous two studies provided examples of systems in which schreckstoff acts to attract additional predators, a system was found for which this was not the case.Cashner (2004) Spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus) were exposed to skin (containing schreckstoff) and muscle (control, containing no schreckstoff) extracts from five different co-occurring prey species. The spotted bass were not attracted to any of the schreckstoff treatments. This result indicates schreckstoff does not always attract relevant predators in the area. Northern pike are an introduced species in many areas, so were not likely to be coevolving with fathead minnows during the evolution of the schreckstoff system. This system may be more ecologically relevant and little evidence suggests schreckstoff evolved as a predator attractant. In conclusion, the debate continues over whether or not the first condition for this hypothesis has been met. The second condition that needs to be met in support of the predator attraction hypothesis is that additional predators must occasionally disrupt predation events, increasing the probability that prey will escape. In the northern pike/fathead minnow system, additional northern pike may interfere with a predation event in one of two ways.(Mathis et al. 1995). First, additional northern pike of the same size interfere with a predation event by coming into contact with the main predator (biting it, etc.). Second, additional pike of larger size attracted to schreckstoff may prey on the initial predator. The probability that fathead minnows escape after being captured by a northern pike significantly increases when a second pike interferes with the predation event.Chivers et al. (1996) The northern pike have an age-structured population biased towards younger, smaller individuals. If a younger pike attacks a fathead minnow and attracts an older, larger conspecific, then the younger pike may be at risk of cannibalism and will be inclined to release the prey to focus on escape. In regards to the second condition, additional predators do appear to disrupt predation events, increasing the probability that the sender will escape. The final condition, that individuals need to successfully recover from a predation event, appears to be satisfied. Support for this condition comes from the observation that many small fishes in natural populations exhibit scars, presumably from failed predator attempts.(Smith and Lemly 1986; Reimchem 1988). While the evidence that schreckstoff attracts predators is mixed, studies indicate multiple predators will interfere with each other and prey can recover from predation events when they manage to escape. The extent to which predators are attracted to a predation event depends upon the speed at which schreckstoff diffuses through its aquatic environment, which in turn depends upon water flow parameters. This hypothesis indicates schreckstoff evolved as a way of increasing the probability of survival during a predation event and its role as a predator cue for conspecifics evolved subsequently. Supported by more empirical studies than the kin selection hypothesis, the predator attraction hypothesis remained popular for quite some time. =Schreckstoff as a possible defense against pathogens, parasites and UVB radiation= The final hypothesis posits that schreckstoff has an immune function and may be the first line of defense against pathogens, parasites, and/or UVB radiation. Evidence for this hypothesis is strong. A recent comprehensive studyChivers et al. (2007) revealed that exposure to parasites and pathogens that penetrate the skin of ostariophysans stimulated the production of alarm cells. Additionally, increased exposure to UV radiation was correlated with an increase in alarm cell production. The role of schreckstoff in immune response was further strengthened by the finding that skin extracts from fathead minnows inhibited the growth of Saprolegnia ferax (a water mould) in culture. In contrast, skin extracts from swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri), which are not believed to produce schreckstoff, increased S. ferax growth compared to controls. Cadmium, a heavy metal and an immunosuppressant in vertebrates,(Sanchez-Dardon et al. 1999) inhibits the production of alarm cells when fishes are infected with Saprolegnia.Chivers et al. (2007) Furthermore, a follow-up studyHalbgewachs et al. (2009) treated fathead minnows with cortisol, a well-known immunosuppressant, which significantly reduced alarm cell investment in conjunction with leukocyte activity. The results of these extensive studies strongly suggest schreckstoff's main function is to provide immunity against a number of environmental threats aimed at the fish's epidermis. If schreckstoff evolved as a defense against pathogens, parasites, and UVB radiation, then the release of schreckstoff into the environment subsequently allowed for both predators and prey to exploit this system. Predators in some systems may use schreckstoff as a cue for an easy meal, either by disrupting the predation event to steal the prey item for themselves or by preying on the initial predator. Nearby conspecifics then exploit schreckstoff as a chemical cue, alerting them to the presence of a predator in the area. Ecological considerations The most convincing research to date indicates alarm substance cells serve as an immune system response and the ecological ramifications of this substance as a chemical alarm signal developed subsequently. This finding generates a number of interesting research questions. First, as mentioned earlier, males in many ostariophysan species cease production of alarm substance cells during the breeding season, presumably so females are not inadvertently repelled from the nest when males incur mechanical damage during nest building. In light of the immune hypothesis, alarm substance cells possibly are instead produced less during the breeding season because increased testosterone levels may decrease immune responses.(Folstad and Karter 1992). Additionally, this finding indicates males are at a greater risk from UVB radiation, as well as parasite and pathogen infection, during the breeding season. The role of schreckstoff as an immune response has additional implications in this age of increasing environmental change.(Chivers et al. 2007). Environmental stressors, including UVB radiation, pollution, and parasites, are increasing in the environment, and are likely to continue increasing over time. UVB radiation exposure is increasing due to decreases in stratospheric ozone,(Blaustein et al. 1997) diseases are becoming increasingly important at both local and global scales,Kiesecker et al. 2004 and pollutants, including heavy metals, are being introduced into ecosystems.(Jenson & Bro-Rasmussen 1992). If cadmium, the heavy metal affecting the fish's ability to produce schreckstoff in response to environmental stressors, increased in concentration in the environment, the immune response of many ostariophysan fishes would be compromised.(Chivers et al. 2007).

As a rookie off the bench, Davis played in 81 games and helped the Pacers to the playoffs where they swept the Orlando Magic in three straight games then upset the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks in six games in the first two rounds en route to facing the Patrick Ewing-led New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers dropped the first two games in New York before rebounding to take the next two in Indiana; in game five in New York teammate Reggie Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Pacers to the victory. The Pacers then returned to Indianapolis with the chance to clinch the Eastern Conference title but lost both game six and the series. The next year the Pacers won 52 games and the Central Division title thanks to the addition of Mark Jackson; Davis meanwhile played in 44 games averaging 7.6 points a game with 6.4 rebounds a game as he missed significant time due to injury. In the playoffs the Pacers faced the Atlanta Hawks for the second consecutive season. The Pacers swept the Hawks in three straight games, then found themselves in a rematch with the Knicks in the second round; in game one (which saw the ejections of Davis and Derek Harper) teammate Reggie Miller made a three-pointer and then stole the inbounds pass and tied the game with another three-pointer right in front of Knicks fan Spike Lee who was just a few feet away. Miller added 2 free throws and gave the Pacers a comeback win. The Pacers lost Game 2 and the series returned to Indiana. After four games, the Pacers took a 3‚Äì1 series lead; however, the Knicks bounced back and forces the seventh game at Madison Square Garden. The Pacers emerged victorious as Patrick Ewing's last-second shot did not go in the basket. With a 1-point win, the Pacers qualified for the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive season. As with their first and second-round opponents, the Pacers played a young talented Orlando Magic team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway in a rematch of the previous postseason. The Pacers pushed Orlando to a 7th game before losing the series. The following season was the most challenging in franchise history but despite that the Pacers duplicated their record from the previous season, 52‚Äì30, with Davis averaging 8.8 points a game with 6.1 rebounds a game. In the playoffs the Pacers were defeated by the sixth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in five games. In the 1996‚Äì97 season the Pacers finished sixth in the Central Division with a record of 39‚Äì43 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989 despite Davis playing in 82 games, starting 28 of them and averaging 10.5 points with 7.3 rebounds a game. The next year the Pacers bounced back and won 58 games and the second seed in the Eastern Conference (with the additions of former Boston Celtics player Larry Bird as head coach and veteran all-star Chris Mullin) with Davis playing in 82 games for the third year in a row while starting 12 of them and averaging 9.6 points a game and 6.8 rebounds a game, in the postseason the Pacers defeated the Shawn Kemp-led Cleveland Cavaliers and Ewing-led New York Knicks in the first two rounds before being matched up with the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals, after losing the first two games in Chicago, the Pacers responded by winning games three and four to forced a deciding game five back in Chicago, a game in which the Bulls won by a score of 106-87 to force a deciding sixth game back in Indiana, game six would be a hard-fought game in which the Pacers won by a score of 92-89 to send the series back to the United Center in Chicago for a deciding seventh game of the series, in game seven the Pacers fought and claw their way to every possession but it was not enough in the end as the eventual champion Bulls still prevailed by a score of 88-83 to win the series. The Pacers entered the season as a heavy favorite because Michael Jordan had retired and other members of the Chicago Bulls were broken up by their management. After a four-month lockout, the Pacers won the Central Division with a record of 33 wins and 17 losses and although he was unable to break into the first team Davis still averaged 9.4 points a game, with 7.0 rebounds a game solidifying his role as rebounder shot blocker and inside scorer. In the playoffs the Pacers swept the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, and the Philadelphia 76ers in the semifinals advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive season, and for the fourth time in six seasons. Once again, the Pacers were up against the New York Knicks. Each game was nip and tuck with both teams trading wins as the Knicks won games one, three (a game best-remembered for Davis fouling Larry Johnson on a four-point play) and five while the Pacers won games two and four to set up a sixth game back at Madison Square Garden in New York. After fighting their way through most of the first three quarters the Pacers lost game six and the series to the Knicks, (marking the second year in a row and fourth overall that the Pacers lost in the Eastern Conference Finals). With a couple of Eastern Conference Finals disappointments coupled with Davis begging for more playing time, Davis announced his intentions to be traded. =Toronto Raptors= =1999-2000 season= On August 1, 1999, Davis was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for the 5th pick of the 1999 NBA draft in high schooler Jonathan Bender. In the 1999‚Äì00 season he solidified his role as a starter and started almost all 79 games that he appeared in. He averaged 11.5 points, 8.8 rebounds with 1.3 blocks for the Raptors as they won 45 games and advanced to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history where they faced a strong, talented New York Knicks team now led by Ewing, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston in the first round. The Knicks swept the Raptors in three games, despite Davis averaging 13.0 points with 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks a game. =2000-2001 season= In the 2000‚Äì01 season, Davis had his most productive season yet, averaging 13.7 points, with 10.1 rebounds plus 1.4 blocks a game and was elected to the NBA All-Star Team for the first and only time in his career. That season the Raptors won 47 games, good enough for second place in the Central Division and advanced to the playoffs for the second year in a row, where they faced a talented Knicks team led by Sprewell and Houston and no longer featured Ewing. The Raptors defeated the Knicks in five games including a 93-89 game five victory with 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 blocks from Davis. In the second round, the Raptors matched up against the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers led by league MVP Allen Iverson and defensive lynchpin Dikembe Mutombo. Every game was neck and neck with both teams trading wins in the first six games of the series, especially a game six win by the Raptors featuring a score of 101-89 with Davis scoring 17 points, grabbing 13 rebounds and blocking 2 shots despite being bothered by a strained triceps muscle in his left arm. In-game seven (a game that would prove to be the most memorable of the series), the first three quarters were nip and tuck with both teams trading leads entering the fourth quarter, and although the Raptors lost game seven to the Sixers by a score of 88-87 and the series, Davis, for the most part, enjoyed a very good series averaging 16.9 points with 11.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks a game. =2001-2002 season= The 2001‚Äì02 season however would be even better for Davis as he averaged his most points per game for a season yet at 14.5 points, with 9.6 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. Although they regressed from 47 wins from a year ago to 42, the Raptors still advanced to the playoffs for the third year in a row, where they faced their Central Division rivals (also great lakes rivals) the Detroit Pistons led by All-star Jerry Stackhouse and rebounding specialist Ben Wallace in the first round. After losing the first two games in Detroit, the Raptors responded by winning the next two games in Toronto, including a 94-84 game three victory thanks to a 30-point 8 rebound performance from Davis to send the series back to Detroit for a deciding game 5. That would prove to be the most memorable game of the series. The game was nip and tuck with both teams trading leads throughout the game and although the Raptors lost Game 5 to the Pistons by a score of 85-82 and the series, Davis enjoyed his best playoff series yet as he increased his playoff production to 17.0 points with 10.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks a game. =2002-2003 season= The 2002‚Äì03 season would prove to be the most difficult season for the Raptors in franchise history as they struggled with injuries all season long and sputtered to a 24-58 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1999 despite Davis averaging 13.9 points with 8.2 rebounds a game. =2003-2004 season= In the 2003‚Äì04 season despite being bothered by trade rumors, Davis still averaged double-doubles for stretches of the season including 14 points with 12 rebounds in a home win against the New Jersey Nets, followed by 13 points with 12 rebounds in a home win against the Dallas Mavericks and finally 10 points with 11 rebounds in a road win against the Atlanta Hawks and his last game with the Raptors against the Orlando Magic, Davis scored 15 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a road win against the Magic, thus ending an era of Toronto Raptors basketball in which had relied on him as a second-leading scorer, rebounder and defensive presence inside. =Chicago Bulls= That season, he was traded to the Chicago Bulls, where he fit in well as a veteran influence on a young team that included Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Kirk Hinrich, although his overall averages decreased from previous years Davis continued to be relied on for his scoring, rebounding and shot- blocking and in the 2004‚Äì05 season, Davis averaged 7.0 points with 5.9 rebounds for the season as the Bulls won 47 games and advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1998 where they faced the Washington Wizards led by Gilbert Arenas, Antawn Jamison, and Larry Hughes in the first round, the Bulls would lose to the Wizards in six games. Davis averaged 9.5 points a game with 6.8 rebounds in 6 playoff games. That summer Davis was elected the President of the NBA Players' Association at the union's annual convention on June 28, 2005. =New York Knicks= Just before the start of the training camp of the 2005-06 season, Davis was traded along with Curry to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney, Tim Thomas and Jermaine Jackson. Through 36 games with the Knicks, Davis averaged 5.0 points with 4.8 rebounds a game. Davis had a season-high of 14 rebounds along with 3 points and 1 assist in a loss against the Wizards and had 11 points and five rebounds with 2 assists and 2 steal as the Knicks defeated the Bulls by a score of 109-101, then a few weeks later he had 11 points again with 9 rebounds as the Knicks defeated the Mavericks by a score of 117-115. Fan incident On January 18, 2006, Davis was ejected from a Knicks-Bulls game for going into the stands and confronting a fan he alleges was intoxicated and abusive. He said he was concerned about his wife, whom he thought he had seen falling back and being touched by the fan. His wife claims that the fan was using inappropriate language around the Davis' child and that she had asked him to stop, which then prompted harassment from the fan. Though public opinion allegedly swung in Davis' favor, the NBA suspended him for five games on January 19. The fan in question, Michael Axelrod, the son of David Axelrod, the 2008 campaign manager for Barack Obama, has stated that he was attacked by Davis' wife, and his lawyer revealed plans to sue for roughly a million dollars and a public apology by the Davis family. Mr. Davis responded by stating, \\"I'm not apologizing to anybody for anything.\\" On January 23, Davis and Axelrod settled their disputes outside of court, issuing the following joint statement. \\"It's clear that the episode at the United Center last week, and its aftermath, evolved from some misunderstandings. This has produced regrets from all parties involved. Common sense strongly suggests that we collectively put this episode behind us and move on. That's what the Davis' and Michael Axelrod plan to do, and we hope everyone else will, as well.\\"Davises, fan settle differences after Knicks- Bulls incident. =Return to Raptors= On February 3, 2006, Davis was traded back to the Raptors for Jalen Rose and a first-round draft pick (from the Denver Nuggets), and an undisclosed sum of cash (believed to be around $3 million). In his first game back with the Raptors, Davis scored 7 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in an overtime loss to the San Antonio Spurs, Davis went on to start the next seven games for the Raptors before missing the next twelve with an ailing back injury. On March 23, 2006, Davis was released by the Raptors after his injury was diagnosed by the team's doctors as being season- ending. United States national basketball team Davis was in Cincinnati coaching an AAU tournament for his daughter in July 2009.

The English translation has been published in the US by Kane/Miller, within the series \\"My Body Science\\", and by Scholastic. In Britain, the book is titled Everybody Poos and is published by Frances Lincoln. The book tells children that all animals defecate and that they have always done so. The book has also been translated into Spanish and Thai. Story Everyone Poops does not have a plot. The first sixteen pages contain various prompts regarding defecation in animals such as opposites (\\"An elephant makes a big poop\\" and \\"[a] mouse makes a tiny poop\\"), comparisons (that various species produce various sizes and shapes of poop) and questions (\\"What does whale poop look like?\\"). On the seventeenth page, a nameless boy with black overalls and a red shirt is introduced, seen running into a bathroom. The book then goes on to explain how people of all ages, from adult to very young child, defecate, and how infants may use diapers. After that, there are only three more illustrations that do not feature the boy. On the next page of the book, the child uses toilet paper and flushes the toilet. The final portion of the book explains that because every animal eats, they must therefore defecate, and the book ends with rear views of the boy and six different animals defecating and the words \\"Everyone Poops\\". Publication Everyone Poops was written by Tar≈ç Gomi, and first published by Tokyo-based Fukuinkan Shoten as Minna Unchi in 1977. It was acquired by Kane/Miller in 1993.

Food that may be consumed according to halakha (law) is termed kosher () in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term kash√©r (), meaning \\"fit\\" (in this context, fit for consumption). Food that is not in accordance with law is called treif (; , derived from trƒÅf√°h) meaning \\"torn.\\" Permitted and forbidden animals The Torah permits eating only those land animals that chew their cud and have cloven hooves.; Four animals, the hare, hyrax, camel, and pig, are specifically identified as being forbidden because they possess only one of the above characteristics: the hare, hyrax and camel are hindgut fermenters and chew their cud but do not have cloven hooves, while the pig has a cloven hoof but does not chew its cud. The Torah lists winged creatures that may not be consumed, mainly birds of prey, fish-eating water-birds, and bats. Certain domesticated fowl can be eaten, such as chicken, geese, quail, dove, and turkey. The Torah permits only those fish which have both fins and scales.; However, monkfish is not considered kosher, and other seafood considered non-kosher includes shellfish like clams, oysters, crabs and shrimp. There is also a risk of products like seaweed and kelp being contaminated by microscopic, non-kosher crustaceans. The Torah forbids two types of sherets (creeping things): * Earth crawlers, e.g. mouse, lizard * Flying creeping things,; with four exceptions: Two types of locust, the cricket, and the grasshopper (translations of the species names vary). Animal products In addition to meat, products of forbidden species and from unhealthy animals were banned by the Talmudic writers.Bekorot 5b This included eggs (including fish roe)Abodah Zarah 41a; Maimonides Mishneh Torah, Ma'akalot Asurot:20-24; Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah, 83:5-10 and milk, as well as derived products such as cheese and jelly, but did not include materials merely \\"manufactured\\" or \\"gathered\\" by animals, such as honey (although, in the case of honey from animals other than bees, there was a difference of opinion among the ancient writers).Bekorot 7b; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah Ma'akalot Asurot:3; Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah, 8-9 According to the rabbinical writers, eggs from ritually pure animals would always be prolate (\\"pointy\\") at one end and oblate (\\"rounded\\") at the other, helping to reduce uncertainty about whether consumption was permitted or not.Hullin 64a; Maimonides Yad, Ma'akalot Asurot:7-11; Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah, 86 =Dairy products= The classic rabbinical writers imply that milk from an animal whose meat is kosher is also kosher. As animals are considered non- kosher if they are discovered to have been diseased after being slaughtered, this could make their milk retroactively non-kosher. However, by adhering to the principle that the majority case overrules the exception, Jewish tradition continues to regard such milk as kosher, since statistically it is true that most animals producing such milk are kosher; the same principle is not applied to the possibility of consuming meat from an animal that has not been checked for disease. Rabbi Hershel Schachter argued that with modern dairy farm equipment, milk from the minority of nonkosher cows is invariably mixed with that of the majority of kosher cows, thus invalidating the permissibility of consuming milk from a large dairy operation. Many leading rabbis, however, rule milk permissible, as do major kashrut authorities. Human breast milk Breast milk from a human female is permitted.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah Ma'akalot Asurot:3; Ketubot 60a; Bekorot 6a; Hullin 112b; Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah, 81 However, authorities assert breast milk may be consumed directly from the breasts only by children younger than four (five if the child is ill), and children older than two were only permitted to continue to suckle if they had not stopped doing so for more than three consecutive days. =Cheese= The situation of cheese is complicated as hard cheese usually involves rennet, an enzyme that splits milk into curds and whey. Most forms of rennet were formerly derived from the stomach linings of animals, but currently rennet is most often made recombinantly in microbes (though most European cheese still uses animal rennet). Because the rennet could be derived from animals, it could potentially be nonkosher. Only rennet made recombinantly, or from the stomachs of kosher animals, if they have been slaughtered according to the laws of kashrut, is kosher. According to the Shulchan Aruch, a rabbinic decree (called gevinat akum) prohibits all cheese made by non-Jews without Jewish supervision, even if its ingredients are all kosher, because very frequently the rennet in cheese is not kosher.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 115:2 Rabbeinu Tam and some of the geonimQuoted in Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Maachalot Asurot 3:14 suggested that this decree does not apply in a location where cheese is commonly made with only kosher ingredients, a position that was practiced in communities in NarbonneTosafot, Avodah Zarah 35a s.v. Chada and Italy. Contemporary Orthodox authorities do not follow this ruling, and hold that cheese requires formal kashrut certification to be kosher; some even argue this is necessary for cheese made with nonanimal rennet. In practice, Orthodox Jews, and some Conservative Jews who observe the kashrut laws, eat cheese only if they are certain the rennet itself was kosher. However, Isaac Klein's tshuva authorized the use of cheese made from non-kosher rennet, and this is widely practised by observant Conservative Jews and Conservative institutions. =Eggs= Jerusalem kugel made with egg noodle, caramelized sugar and black pepper The eggs of kosher birds are kosher. Eggs are considered pareve despite being an animal product. Blood found in eggs Occasionally blood spots are found within an egg, which can affect the kosher status of the egg. The halacha varies depending on whether or not there is a possibility of the egg being fertilized. If the egg may have been fertilized, the Rishonim and Shulchan Aruch suggest a complex set of rules for determining whether the egg may be eaten; among these rules, if blood appears on the yolk, the entire egg is forbidden.Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah 66 To avoid the complexity of these rules, R' Moshe Isserles records a custom not to eat any such eggs with blood spots. If the egg was definitely unfertilized (laid by a hen kept isolated from roosters), many authorities (including Rabbis Moshe Feinstein and Ovadiah Yosef rule that one may remove the blood spot and then eat the remainder of the egg. This is the case nowadays, when battery eggs form the majority of available produce. Regarding the question of whether one must check an egg for blood spots, the Shulchan Aruch rules that one may eat hard-boiled eggs where checking is impossible.Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 66:8 R' Moshe Isserles adds that checking is not required, but that a custom exists to check eggs if they are cracked during the daytime (when blood could be seen). A contemporary Ashkenazi authority writes that while \\"halacha does not require\\" checking supermarket- bought eggs, \\"there is a minhag\\" to do so. Nevertheless, eggs are not checked in commercial settings where doing so would be expensive. =Gelatin= Kosher gummy bears Gelatin is hydrolysed collagen,Geliko Kosher Gelatin, Functional & Nutraceutical Properties. the main protein in animal connective tissue, and therefore could potentially come from a nonkosher source, such as pig skin. Gelatin has historically been a prominent source of glue, finding uses from musical instruments to embroidery, one of the main historic emulsions used in cosmetics and in photographic film, the main coating given to medical capsule pills, and a form of food including jelly, trifle, and marshmallows; the status of gelatin in kashrut is consequently fairly controversial. Due to the ambiguity over the source of individual items derived from gelatin, many Orthodox rabbis regard it as generally being nonkosher. However, Conservative rabbisUnited Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, Keeping Kosher: A Diet For the Soul (2000) and several prominent Orthodox rabbis, including Chaim Ozer Grodzinski and Ovadia Yosefthe former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israelargue that gelatin has undergone such total chemical change and processing that it should not count as meat, and therefore would be kosher.Yabia Omer, Vol. 8; Yoreh De'ah No. 11 Technically, gelatin is produced by separating the three strands in each collagen fiber's triple helix by boiling collagen in water. Rabbi Dr. David Sheinkopf, author of Gelatin in Jewish Law (Bloch 1982) and Issues in Jewish Dietary Laws (Ktav 1998), has published in-depth studies of the kosher uses of gelatin, as well as carmine and kitniyot. One of the main methods of avoiding nonkosher gelatin is to substitute gelatin-like materials in its place; substances with a similar chemical behaviour include food starch from tapioca, chemically modified pectins, and carrageenan combined with certain vegetable gumsguar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, gum acacia, agar, and others. Although gelatin is used for several purposes by a wide variety of manufacturers, it has started to be replaced with these substitutes in a number of products, due to the use of gelatin also being a significant concern to vegans and vegetarians. Today manufacturers are producing gelatin from the skins of kosher fish, circumventing many of these problems. Ritual slaughter Kosher slaughter of a chicken One of the few dietary laws appearing in Exodus prohibits eating the meat from animals that have been \\"torn by beasts\\"; a related law appears in Deuteronomy, prohibiting the consumption of anything that has died from natural causes. Some have claimed that the Book of Ezekiel implies that the rules about animals that die of natural causes, or are \\"torn by beasts\\", were adhered to only by the priests, and were intended only for them; the implication that they did not apply to, and were not upheld by, ordinary Israelites was noticed by the classical rabbis, who declared \\"the prophet Elijah shall some day explain this problematic passage\\".Menahot 45a Traditional Jewish thought has expressed the view that all meat must come from animals that have been slaughtered according to Jewish law. These strict guidelines require the animal be killed by a single cut across the throat to a precise depth, severing both carotid arteries, both jugular veins, both vagus nerves, the trachea and the esophagus, no higher than the epiglottis and no lower than where cilia begin inside the trachea, causing the animal to bleed to death. Orthodox Jews explain that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, claiming that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called for it to be banned. To avoid tearing, and to ensure the cut is thorough, such slaughter is usually performed by a trained individual, with a large, razor-sharp knife, which is checked before each slaughter to ensure that it has no irregularities (such as nicks and dents); if irregularities are discovered, or the cut is too shallow, the meat is deemed unkosher. Rabbis usually require the slaughterer, known within Judaism as a shochet, to also be a pious Jew of good character and an observer of the Shabbat. In smaller communities, the shochet was often the town rabbi, or a rabbi from a local synagogue, but large slaughterhouses usually employ a full-time shochet if they intend to sell kosher meat. The Talmud, and later Jewish authorities, also prohibit the consumption of meat from animals who were slaughtered despite being in the process of dying from disease; but this is not based on concern for the health of the eater, instead being an extension of the rules banning the meat from animals torn by beasts, and animals that die from natural causes.Hullin 3Maimonides Yad, Ma'akalot Asuro:5-11Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah 29-60 To comply with this Talmudic injunction against eating diseased animals, Orthodox Jews usually require that the corpses of freshly slaughtered animals be thoroughly inspected. There are 70 different traditional checks for irregularities and growths; for example, there are checks to ensure that the lungs have absolutely no scars, which might have been caused by an inflammation. If these checks are passed, the meat is then termed glatt (), the Yiddish word meaning smooth. Compromises in countries with animal cruelty laws that prohibit such practices involve stunning the animal to lessen the suffering that occurs while the animal bleeds to death. However, the use of electric shocks to daze the animal is often not accepted by some markets as producing meat that is kosher. =Forbidden parts of a slaughtered animal= As forbidden fats, tendons, blood vessels and the gid hanasheh (sciatic nerve) must be removed, and this is more difficult in the rearquarters, often only cuts of meat from the forequarters are commonly available. Leviticus prohibits the eating of certain types of fat (chelev) from sacrificial land animals (cattle, sheep, and goats), since the fat is the portion of the meat exclusively allocated to God (by burning it on the altar). Foreleg, cheeks and maw  The gift of the foreleg, cheeks and maw of a kosher-slaughtered animal to a Kohen is a positive commandment in the Hebrew Bible. Some rabbinic opinions maintain that consumption of the animal is forbidden before these gifts are given, though the accepted halacha is to permit this. Furthermore, the actual foreleg, cheeks and maw of all kosher- slaughtered beef are forbidden to a non-kohen unless the kohen permits.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 61:31 Blood One of the main biblical food laws forbids consuming blood on account of \\"the life [being] in the blood\\". This ban and reason are listed in the Noahide Laws and twice in Book of Leviticus; as well as in Deuteronomy. The classical rabbis argued that, in a number of cases, only if it is impossible to remove every drop of blood, the prohibition against consuming blood was impractical, and there should be rare exceptions: they claimed that consuming the blood that remained on the inside of meat (as opposed to the blood on the surface of it, dripping from it, or housed within the veins) should be permitted and that the blood of fish and locusts could also be consumed.Keritot 2a, 20b; Hullin 111a, 117a To comply with this prohibition, a number of preparation techniques became practiced within traditional Judaism. The main technique, known as meli·∏•ah, involves the meat being soaked in water for about half an hour, which opens pores. After this, the meat is placed on a slanted board or in a wicker basket, and is thickly covered with salt on each side, then left for between 20 minutes and one hour. The salt covering draws blood from the meat by osmosis, and the salt must be subsequently removed from the meat (usually by trying to shake most of it off and then washing the meat twice) to complete the extraction of the blood. The type of salt used in the process is known as kosher salt. Meli·∏•ah is not sufficient to extract blood from the liver, lungs, heart, and certain other internal organs, since they naturally contain a high density of blood, and therefore these organs are usually removed before the rest of the meat is salted. Roasting, on the other hand, discharges blood while cooking, and is the usual treatment given to these organs. It is also an acceptable method for removing blood from all meat. Food preparation by non- Jews Rabbi in a Kosher wine shop The classical rabbis prohibited any item of food that had been consecrated to an idol or had been used in the service of an idol.Abodah Zarah 29b Since the Talmud views all non-Jews as potential idolaters, and viewed intermarriage with apprehension, it included within this prohibition any food that has been cooked or prepared completely by non- Jews.Abodah Zarah 35b, 38a (Bread sold by a non-Jewish baker was not included in the prohibition.) Similarly, a number of Jewish writers believed food prepared for Jews by non-Jewish servants would not count as prepared by potential idolaters, although this view was opposed by Jacob ben Asher.Jacob ben Asher, Yoreh De'ah, 113:4 Consequently, Orthodox Jews generally rule that wine, certain cooked foods, and sometimes dairy products,[http://www.koltorah.org/RAVJ/13-7%20Chalav%20Yisrael%20-%20Part%201.htm Chalav Yisrael - Part I: Rav Soloveitchik's View] should be prepared only by Jews. The prohibition against drinking non-Jewish wine, traditionally called yayin nesekh (literally meaning \\"wine for offering [to a deity]\\"), is not absolute. Cooked wine (Hebrew: , yayin mevushal), meaning wine that has been heated, is regarded as drinkable on the basis that heated wine was not historically used as a religious libation; thus kosher wine will often be prepared by Jews and then pasteurised, after which it can be handled by a non- Jew. Some Jews refer to these prohibited foods as akum, an acronym of Ovde Kokhavim U Mazzaloth (), meaning \\"worshippers of stars and planets (or Zodiac)\\". Akum is thus a reference to activities that these Jews view as idolatry, and in many significant works of post-classical Jewish literature, such as the Shulchan Aruch, it has been applied to Christians in particular. However, among the classical rabbis, there were a number who refused to treat Christians as idolaters, and consequently regarded food that had been manufactured by them as being kosher. Conservative Judaism is more lenient; in the 1960s, Rabbi Silverman issued a responsum, officially approved by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, in which he argued that wine manufactured by an automated process was not \\"manufactured by gentiles\\", and therefore would be kosher. A later responsum of Conservative Judaism was issued by Rabbi Dorff, who argued, based on precedents in 15th-19th century responsa, that many foods, such as wheat and oil products, which had once been forbidden when produced by non-Jews were eventually declared kosher. On this basis he concluded wine and grape products produced by non-Jews would be permissible. Milk and meat Three times the Torah specifically forbids \\"seething\\" a young goat \\"in its mother's milk\\"., , and The Talmud interprets this as a general prohibition against cooking meat and dairy products together, and against eating or deriving any benefit from such a mixture. To help prevent accidental violation of these rules, the modern standard Orthodox practice is to classify food into either being meat, dairy, or neither; this third category is more usually referred to as pareve (also spelled parve and parev) meaning \\"neutral\\". As the biblical prohibition uses the word gedi (\\"kid\\") and not the phrase gedi izim (\\"goat-kid\\") used elsewhere in the Torah, the rabbis concluded that the flesh of all domestic mammals (behemoth) is included in the prohibition. Flesh of fish and bugs is not included, and therefore is considered pareve. By rabbinic decree, the flesh of birds and wild mammals (chayot), such as deer, is considered as \\"meat\\", rather than pareve. By rabbinic law and custom, not only are meat and milk not cooked together, but they are not eaten even separately within a single meal. Safety concerns =Pikuach nefesh= The laws of kashrut can be broken for pikuach nefesh (preservation of human life). For example, a patient is allowed to eat non-kosher food if it is essential for recovery, or where the person would otherwise starve. =Tainted food= The Talmud adds to the biblical regulations a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals.Hullin 58b Similarly, Yoreh De'ah prohibits the drinking of water, if the water had been left uncovered overnight in an area where there might be snakes, on the basis that a snake might have left its venom in the water. In a place where there aren't usually snakes, this prohibition does not apply.Tosafot, Beitzah 6a =Fish and meat= The Talmud and Yoreh De'ah suggest that eating meat and fish together may cause tzaraath.Pesahim 76b; Yoreh De'ah 116:2 Strictly Orthodox Jews thus avoid combining the two, while Conservative Jews may or may not. Kosherfest Each year 5,000 food industry vendors, kosher certification agencies, journalists and other professionals gather in New York City to sample kosher fare from 300 event attendees. Among the offerings at the 2018 Kosherfest were plantain croutons from Ecuador. The gluten free croutons won the Kosherfest award for best new snack. There were breaded dessert ravioli stuffed with sweet ricotta and chocolate chips, pareve and vegan \\"ice cream\\" cake made from cherry and passion fruit sorbet, butter substitute made from coconut oil, and a gluten free variation of Syrian sambusak dumplings.

","title":"Kosher foods"},{"id":"1260782","text":"Eugene Wilder Chafin (November 1, 1852 ‚Äì November 30, 1920) was an American politician and writer who served as the Prohibition Party's presidential candidate during the 1908 and 1912 presidential elections. He was active in local politics in Wisconsin, statewide elections in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Arizona, and campaigned throughout the United States and the world in favor of the prohibition of alcohol. After serving as a delegate to multiple Prohibition national conventions he rose to serving on the national committee and then received the presidential nomination twice, but declined to seek the nomination again for the 1916 presidential election. Early life The program for a Chautauqua movement lecture that featured Chafin Eugene Wilder Chafin was born on November 1, 1852, to Samuel Evans Chafin and Betsy Almira Pollard on his family's farm in between East Troy and Mukwonago, Wisconsin. Chafin attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and graduated on June 17, 1875 with a law degree and during his education shared a room with future Governor, Senator, and presidential candidate Robert M. La Follette. From 1875 to 1901 he practiced law in Waukesha, Wisconsin. On November 24, 1881, he married Carrie Arvila Hunkins and later had two children with her, one that died after birth on February 22, 1884 and Desdemona Eleanor on March 17, 1893. On October 1, 1901, he moved to Chicago to become the superintendent of the city's Washingtonian home, which housed 1,500 alcoholics, and served in that position until 1904. From 1904 to 1908 he served as a lecturer as part of the Chautauqua movement. In 1909, he was admitted to practice law before the Supreme Court of the United States after being presented by Senator La Follette and with Carrie Nation in attendance. Career =Local politics= In 1881, he left the Republican Party and joined the Prohibition Party and in the same year ran for District Attorney in Waukesha county. From 1884 to 1920, he served as a delegate to the Prohibition national conventions, from 1888 to 1896 he served as a national committeeman from Wisconsin and again for Arizona and California from 1912 to 1920, at the 1884 convention he served as the Sergeant-at-Arms and gave one of the seconding speechings for John St. John, and in 1900 he served on the platform committee. In 1877, he was elected as the Justice of the Peace in Waukesha and served until 1883 and then served as Police Justice until 1885. He later served on the school and public library board. Chafin ran for the House of Representatives in Wisconsin in 1882 and in Illinois in 1902. In 1886 and 1900, he ran for attorney general in Wisconsin and later ran for attorney general in Illinois in 1904. In 1898, he ran for Governor of Wisconsin. =Presidential= 1908 On July 16, 1908, Chafin was nominated by A. G. Wolfenbarger and Chafin won the Prohibition presidential nomination on the third ballot with 636 delegates voting for him against William B. Palmore, Daniel R. Sheen, Alfred L. Manierre, Will W. Tracy, Frederick F. Wheeler, James B. Cranfill, and Oliver W. Stewart. The vice presidential nomination was offered to Palmore due to him receiving the second highest amount of support, but he declined and the position was instead given to Aaron S. Watkins. While running for president he was also simultaneously running for the Prohibition gubernatorial nomination in Illinois, but was defeated in the primary by Daniel R. Sheen. In August, he was swimming at the YMCA in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he almost drowned, but was rescued by three people. On August 14, 1908, he was giving a speech in Springfield, Illinois, when a lynch mob started a race riot in an attempt to kill three black prisoners and while he was taking his handkerchief out from his pocket a member of the mob believed that he was pulling a gun out and threw a brick at him. In the general election he received 254,087 votes for 1.71% of the total popular vote. 1912 Chafin started his second presidential campaign on January 5, 1912, in Tucson, Arizona, and then traveled east towards Atlantic City, New Jersey, where on July 12, 1912, he won the Prohibition presidential nomination on the first ballot with 594 delegates after having his name presented by F. J. Sibley and Watkins was selected as his vice president again after two ballots. After winning the nomination he traveled towards the western United States and campaigned in all of the states along the Pacific Coast before the general election. During the campaign he traveled a total of 36,300 miles through thirty states and received 208,156 votes for 1.38% of the popular vote in the general election. 1916 In December 1915, he stated that he would not seek the Prohibition presidential nomination again for the 1916 presidential election and that he believed that Representative Richmond P. Hobson would receive the nomination. He also gave his support to Henry Ford's Peace Ship and that he would put forward a vote to add abolishing the War and Navy Departments and establishing a Department of Peace at the 1916 National Prohibition Convention. Chafin attempted to draft Henry Ford for the Prohibition presidential nomination, but he made no attempt. At the national convention he put forward former New York Governor William Sulzer for the presidential nomination, but he was defeated by former Indiana Governor Frank Hanly with 440 delegates to 188 delegates on July 21, 1916. An attempt was made to make Hanly's nomination unanimous, but it failed after Chafin objected. He also objected and stopped efforts to rename the party to either the Progressive, American, or National party and criticized Virgil G. Hinshaw for writing to John M. Parker in an attempt to fuse the Prohibition and Progressive parties. In the general election, Hanly and Ira Landrith received 221,302 votes for 1.19% of the popular vote. Later life In 1908, Chafin was appointed to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States and in October 1909, he and his family moved to Tucson in the Arizona Territory. Following Arizona's admission into the United States as a state he ran in the House special election and received 0.41% in fourth place. In January 1913, he started a campaign in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to fundraise $1,000,000 for the Prohibition party to use during the 1916 elections and later participated in a fundraising event in November across Ohio to raise $10,000 for the party. On January 29, 1914, he announced that he would run in Arizona's Senate election and received 15.05% in the general election and from 1914 to 1915 gave lectures as part of the Flying Squadron of America. Chafin also campaigned in favor of a California ballot proposition to prohibit alcohol in 1914 and during it stated that women who voted against it deserved to be beaten by their husbands. On January 6, 1919, Chafin and his family boarded the S.S. Sonoma to travel to Australia to help the Australian prohibition movement. The Eighteenth Amendment banning alcohol was ratified while he was traveling on January 16, 1919, and he was interviewed after disembarking in Australia. On November 20, 1920, Chafin was lighting his gas heater at his home in Long Beach, Los Angeles, and his clothing caught fire. He suffered burns and was initially saved by Henry Murray who wrapped him in quilts, but died on November 30. In 1921, his cremated remains were buried in Prairie Home Cemetery in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and the National Prohibition Committee had a memorial hour for Chafin at its November 1921, session.

Synthesis Aldaric acids are usually synthesized by the oxidation of aldoses with nitric acid. In this reaction it is the open-chain (polyhydroxyaldehyde) form of the sugar that reacts. An aldaric acid is an aldose in which both the hydroxyl function of the terminal carbon and the aldehyde function of the first carbon have been fully oxidized to carboxylic acid functions. (Oxidation of just the aldehyde yields an aldonic acid while oxidation of just the terminal hydroxyl group yields an uronic acid.) Aldaric acids cannot form cyclic hemiacetals like unoxidized sugars, but they can sometimes form lactones. Structure Nomenclature of the aldaric acids is based on the sugars from which they are derived; for example, glucose is oxidized to glucaric acid and xylose to xylaric acid. Unlike their parent sugars, aldaric acids have the same functional group at both ends of their carbon chain; therefore, two different sugars can yield the same aldaric acid (this can be understood by looking at the Fischer projection of a sugar upside down‚Äîwith normal aldoses, this is a different compound due to the aldehyde function at the top and the hydroxyl function at the bottom, but with aldaric acids, there is a carboxylic acid function on both ends, so upside down and right side up do not matter). For example, D-glucaric acid and L-gularic acid are the same compound (but the first name is preferred, because of D\\\\- prefix). A consequence of this is that some aldaric acids are meso forms with no optical activity despite their multiple chiral centers‚Äîthis occurs if a sugar and its enantiomer oxidize to the same aldaric acid. An example is D-galactose‚Äîit has four chiral centers, but D-galactaric and L-galactaric acids, which have the opposite configuration at each chiral center and therefore would be expected to be enantiomers, are actually the same compound; therefore, galactaric acid is an achiral meso form with no optical activity. Again, this can be understood by taking the Fischer projection of either acid and looking at it upside down‚Äîthe configuration is now switched at every carbon. File:Aldaric_acids.gif Adipic acid, HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH, is not an aldaric acid, though it is structurally similar. In fact, six-carbon aldaric acids can be considered tetrahydroxyl derivatives of adipic acid. References * Carey, Francis A. (2006). Organic Chemistry, Sixth Edition, New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. .

Typically the question concerns the constitutionality of legislation. Constitutional and statutory authority =Reference jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada= The Constitution Act, 1867, gives the federal Parliament the power to create a \\"General Court of Appeal for Canada\\", but does not define the jurisdiction of the Court.Constitution Act, 1867, s. 101. When Parliament created the Supreme Court of Canada in 1875, it gave the federal Cabinet the power to refer questions to the Supreme Court for the Court's opinion.The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, S.C. 1875, c. 11. That provision has been carried forward and is now found in the current Supreme Court Act.Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, s.53. Under that provision, the federal Cabinet may submit a question to the Supreme Court of Canada by means of an order-in-council. Once the questions have been submitted to the Court, the Court has complete control over the process to be followed. The reference is treated in the same way as an appeal. The Attorney General of Canada is entitled to appear before the Court and to make submissions. The Attorneys General of the provinces and territories are entitled to notice of a reference and may appear on it. Interested parties are able to apply for intervener status to make submissions during the hearing. When necessary, the Court may appoint an to submit a factum to support a particular view. Once the parties have been determined, the Court sets out a timetable for the filing of written submissions, and for the date of the hearing. Parties to the reference file detailed written submissions on the legal issues raised by the reference, supplemented by factual records if necessary. After all written submissions have been filed, the Court holds an oral hearing on the reference questions. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court typically reserves its decision. At a later date, the Court releases its opinion on the reference, in the form of a detailed written judgment. Individual judges of the Court are entitled to dissent from the majority opinion, in the same way as with judgments in appeals. The opinion given by the Supreme Court is in the form of a judicial decision but is not legally binding; nevertheless, no government has ever ignored the opinion. Prior to 1949, there was an appeal from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, sitting in London. The Judicial Committee served as the highest court for the British Empire and Commonwealth. Many federal reference questions were appealed to the Judicial Committee, which had the final say and could overrule the decision of the Supreme Court. =Reference jurisdiction of the provincial courts= The provincial governments, under their respective Constitutional Questions Acts, are able to submit questions to the provincial Superior Court or Court of Appeal. The process is very similar to the federal government reference questions. Once the provincial Court of Appeal has given its decision on the reference question, the government or other parties to the reference have the right under the Supreme Court Act to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. Prior to 1949, appeals lay directly from the provincial courts of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This right of direct appeal allowed litigants to by-pass the Supreme Court, so many provincial reference cases were never heard by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was then required to follow the decision of the Judicial Committee. Constitutionality of the reference jurisdiction There have been challenges to the power of the federal government to confer the reference jurisdiction on the Supreme Court, but these challenges have been rejected, most recently in the Reference re Secession of Quebec in 1998.Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217. Pursuant to the ruling of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada (References Reference) [1912] A.C. 571, the role of the courts in references is not judicial as such, but one of advising the executive branch of government.  Federal reference questions  There have been over 75 federal references to the Supreme Court since 1892. Prior to the abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee, many of the earlier federal references went on appeal from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee. Since the abolition of appeals, the Supreme Court decision is the final say on a federal reference. =Decisions by the Supreme Court= * Reference re Senate Reform, 2014 SCC 32 * Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6, 2014 * Reference re Securities Act, 2011 * Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, 2004 * Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998 2 S.C.R. 217] *Reference re David Milgaard Conviction, [1992 1 S.C.R. 866] (April 14, 1992) * Reference re Ng Extradition, [1991] 2 SCR 858, 1991 CanLII 79 * Reference re Manitoba Language Rights (1984), [1985 1 S.C.R. 721] * Reference re Authority of Parliament in Relation to the Upper House, [1980 1 S.C.R. 54] (The Senate Reference) * Anti- Inflation Reference, 1976 * Reference re Farm Products Marketing Act, 1957 * Reference re Regina v.

Canada Temperance Federation  Imperial reference questions relating to Canada  * Labrador Boundary Reference, [1927 UKPC 25] Reference jurisdiction in other countries The government of the United Kingdom has the power to refer questions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This power served as one of the inspirations for the reference power under the Supreme Court Act. There has been one reference directly under this power to the Judicial Committee which related to Canada, concerning the Labrador boundary dispute between Canada and Newfoundland, which at that time was an independent dominion, not part of Canada. Other Commonwealth countries, such as India, South Africa, and Papua New Guinea also have implemented a reference jurisdiction in their constitutions. In the case of Papua New Guinea, their constitutional convention immediately prior to independence took counsel from Canadian legal academics on the use of the reference jurisdiction. Other jurisdictions, notably Australia and the United States, eschew reference jurisdiction for their courts. In the United States, the case or controversy clause of Article III of the United States Constitution limits federal courts to hear only actual cases; advisory opinions are not permitted at the federal level (although some state constitutions do provide for such opinions). Likewise, the Australian Constitution has a similar requirement in Chapter III of the Constitution. Notes External links * Constitution Act, 1867, s. 101 * Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The anime series is also licensed by Viz Media for an English language release in North America, and by ShoPro Entertainment, as Mirmo!. Plot ; Season 1 The fairy protagonist is a love fairy named Mirmo (Mirumo in the Japanese version). Katie Minami (Kaede Minami in the Japanese version) is the human protagonist and a cheerful and energetic eighth-grader who is shy around her male classmates, which makes it difficult for her to date. One day, on her way home from school, she walks into a mysterious shop and buys a blue cocoa mug. When she arrives at home, she peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note which says, \\"If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy (\\"muglox\\") will appear and grant your every wish.\\" The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Dylan Yuki (Setsu Yuuki in the Japanese version), her crush. Mirmo arrives. At first she is afraid of him but later understands that he is a muglox. Kaede soon finds out that Mirmo prefers eating chocolate and creating mischief over helping Katie. Mirumo is a prince of the muglox world. Horrified at the prospect of having to marry Rima (Rirumu in the Japanese version), his princess bride-to-be, Mirmo escaped the muglox world. Hot on his heels, however, are Rima, Yatch (Yashichi in the Japanese version) the bounty hunter, Mulu (Murumo; Mirmo's brother), and many other muglox as well. The villains of the first season are the Warumo gang, a gang of criminals who plan to overthrow the Marumo kingdom. Though they are villains, they actually aren't evil; they just pull childish pranks and faint after hearing an evil plan. At the end of the season, Akumi gives Warumo Gang a time sphere, which they play around with and accidentally smash, causing the muglox world to freeze. Mirmo, Mulu, Rima, Yatch and their partners save the muglox world by having the fairies dance in front of a magical door (which allows it to open) and having the partners find the magic time bird which flew into the door to escape being captured by them. ; Season 2 In this season a new transfer student named Saori comes to Katie's school. The villain Darkman, created by the darkness in human hearts, tries to resurrect himself. He influences the minds of Akumi and the Warumo gang. Session magic is introduced for two-person magic, with each person combo producing different magic. Darkman controls Saori and uses her flute to control peoples' emotions. He is then defeated by Golden Mirmo, the outcome of three person session magic. With the help of Nezumi/Rato, he is resurrected until the muglox's four-person session magic gives Saori the power to defeat Darkman. The two worlds are separated until reunited by the muglox and their partners' friendship. Saori goes to Germany to study music with Akumi as her new partner. ; Season 3 In this season a robot octopus, Tako, convinces the gang to look for the legendary seven crystals which are drawn out by different emotions. After all are collected, the gang faces seven trials. Mirmo must pass these tests for the crystals to unite and form a pendant. Tako steals it to save his girlfriend and his land. In the end, they succeed and Tako becomes king of crystal land. ; Season 4 Two new characters, Koichi and Haruka, are introduced. Koichi has a crush on Katie, and Haruka is Setsu's childhood friend who wants to be a cartoonist. Her partner Panta is a ghost muglox. Thanks to Azumi, Katie and Koichi kiss. Also, Koichi confessed to Katie after Katie had a whole day of helping him confess to his crush that she didn't know was her. Setsu starts to fall in love with Katie, and Koichi realizes that he is not right for Kaede and gives up on her. After Haruka tells Dylan she loves him, he chooses her over Katie. Haruka realizes Dylan's true love is Katie and gives up on him. Dylan tells Katie he loves her and they become a couple; Katie's wish is fulfilled. Mirmo has to leave in one hour or something terrible will happen, which the Warumo gang make so. Mirmo loses all memories of Katie and turns into a rabbit. Katie brings his memories back and he turns back to normal. Characters The main characters of Mirmo! are mugloxes, or love fairies, and four human teenagers. The muglox Mirmo has been assigned the task of granting Kaede Minami's wishes, though he spends most of his time eating chocolate and running away from Rima, a female muglox assigned to Setsu Yuki, the boy Kaede is infatuated with. Yasichi, Mirmo's muglox archrival, is assigned to Azumi Hidaka, a girl who also loves Setsu and is jealous of Kaede. Mirmo's brother, Murumo, is assigned to Kaoru Matsutake, a boy who falls in love with Kaede. The muglox fairies use musical instruments as their magical tools. Later on in the show two new characters, Koichi Sumita and Haruka Morishita, enter the race of love for Setsu and Kaede's hearts. They get their very own muglox partners as well ‚Äì Popii and Panta.

He was educated in a rank and file urban family and graduated from the \\"Illyricum\\" High School of the city. Very soon he learned to play guitar, trombone, the piano and devoted himself with enthusiasm and passion to the art of music. In the years of his youth, he composed over 200 original songs, which were immediately sung in the city of Shkod√´r and were spread all over Albania, such as \\"Lule Bore\\" (), \\"Syte e tu si drite\\" (English: Your Eyes Like Light), \\"Weaving girl\\". He completed his studies over the years 1952‚Äì1958 in the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (Czechoslovakia). During the years 1956-1958 in the city of Prague, he conducted: Franz Schubert's Rosamunda, Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt's, Ji≈ô√≠ Anton√≠n Benda's Pygmalion, K. Dittersdorff \\"Concert symphony for violin and contrabass\\", and Franz Liszt's Les Preludes. In 1958 he returned to Tirana, where he started teaching at the Artistic Lyceum of Tirana and later in 1961 was among the first lecturers in Academy of Music and Arts of Albania, where he prepared whole generations of musicians and artists, teaching the subjects of polyphony, orchestration, conducting, intonation and chamber music. In 1958, while being a teacher, he also worked for the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, where he conducted many worldwide renowned works, which were interpreted for the first time in Albania. Such works were: Gaetano Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Gioachino Rossini's Barber of Seville, Tish Daija's Pranvera (), and two ballets (by Sergei Vasilenko's Lola, and Alexander Krein's Laurencia). Under his care and passion, he recorded many works of the Albanian composers: such as √áesk Zadeja, Pjet√´r Gaci, Nova, Tish Daija, Tonin Harapi, Pjet√´r Dungu, Grimci, Kono etc., and the music of some Albanian movies. In 1967, he conducted in China works by Albanian composers. Gjoni was also one of the founders of the Symphonic Orchestra of the Albanian Radio-Television. He worked persistently and with discipline for the establishment and growth of that group. Gjoni's activity as a composer has passed through all genres from the song, romance, cantata, suite, ballads, works for piano, clarinet, violin and major orchestral works such as: Symphonic dances, Symphonic poems, Symphonic Suite up to Symphony in Mib. Gjoni was a composer with a noble inspiration and pathos, whose music flows freely. Critic of music and musicologist George Leotsakos, in his letter dated 22 December 1991 characterized him as follows: \\"Simon Gjoni was an excellent composer, a predestined creator, with a profound aesthetic and musical culture, but above all with a marvelous human personality, with a golden heart in harmony with his refined culture.\\" Likewise, in the field of musical critique, he has left numerous theoretical works, related to the Albanian musical art and his work \\"The Instruments and the Art of Orchestration\\". Composer √áesk Zadeja wrote the following on Gjoni on Drita, an Albanian cultural periodical, dated 1 December 1991, right after Gjoni's death: > The name of Simon Gjoni will remain graven in the pentagram of the Albanian > music. The highest assessment for each creator is then when his work (his > message) has its repercussion in the profundity of the time, increasing its > values along as the time passes by. These features are attributed to the > talented artist, composer, conductor, lecturer and musicologist Simon Gjoni.

A premium fare might be levied at times where traffic- levels would otherwise be unbearably high, for instance on summer Fridays or during rush hours, or on a clearly identifiable route where a timely arrival is perceived as particularly important (e.g. reaching a ferry terminal or airport for an onward link for which a high price has already been paid). If the fare level deters some passengers this might reduce vandalism and maintenance costs and minimise the dwell-time required at any intermediate stops between the most popular stops. Many premium fare operations are non- stop (light) railway links and they can therefore abstract considerable capacity from any railway line also used by slower (normally less glamouress) services. Along congested transport corridors or inner suburbs with lower car ownership levels and typically lower traffic speeds, the adverse impact of fast trains upon other passenger train timetables or parking opportunities raises issues of social equity. Political parties differ widely on whether public transport operations should meet their costs or be viewed partly as a welfare service supporting broader aims of balancing development, life-chances and job opportunities across a city region. Premium fares can thus be viewed as socially divisive, although when applied only to short periods of a working-day they can improve levels of safety and comfort through enticing travellers to spread their journey times. That might have multiplier benefits on personal stress, crime levels and pollution incidence if managed with sensitivity to the public good (rather than simply in pursuance of an operator's profit motive). Emphasizing the benefits of an off-peak zonal rover ticket at a lower fare than peak-period options over an identical route is one well-tried way of making premium peak-hour fares seem more acceptable, it is an instance of a clever marketing slant. Road tolls as introduced on turnpikes can also be varied by time of day, day of week, or season with identical motives. These can also be market-led or community-determined and might be accrued to repay loans secured by a firm or transport agency to enable the construction of a bridge, tunnel or high-grade section of road. Again the higher priced option has to be demonstrably better than any alternative route that can be freely driven (excluding running costs of the vehicle). Wherever a fare is deliberately pitched lower than the norm, this is termed predatory pricing and can lead to antitrust action where regulators have some authority. It is a tactic used to achieve a more monopolistic position in a local 'marketplace', in plain language to squeeze-out an upstart operator, or possibly a well-established one perceived as rather complacent or vulnerable for other reasons (such as poorly remunerated staff).

It was one of the first Sanskrit texts to have been translated into English in 1776, by Sir William Jones, and was used to formulate the Hindu law by the British colonial government.P Bilimoria (2011), The Idea of Hindu Law, Journal of the Oriental Society of Australia, Volume 43, pages 103-130It can be considered as the world‚Äôs first constitution as it contains laws regarding society, taxes, warfare,etc. Over fifty manuscripts of the Manusmriti are now known, but the earliest discovered, most translated and presumed authentic version since the 18th century has been the \\"Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) manuscript with Kulluka Bhatta commentary\\". Modern scholarship states this presumed authenticity is false, and the various manuscripts of Manusmriti discovered in India are inconsistent with each other, and within themselves, raising concerns of its authenticity, insertions and interpolations made into the text in later times. The metrical text is in Sanskrit, is variously dated to be from the 2nd century BCE to 3rd century CE, and it presents itself as a discourse given by Manu (Svayambhuva) and Bhrigu on dharma topics such as duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and others. The text's fame spread outside Bharat (India), long before the colonial era. The medieval era Buddhistic law of Myanmar and Thailand are also ascribed to Manu,Steven Collins (1993), The discourse of what is primary, Journal of Indian philosophy, Volume 21, pages 301-393Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 3-4 and the text influenced past Hindu kingdoms in Cambodia and Indonesia.Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , page 77 Manusmriti is also called the ''''' or Laws of Manu. Nomenclature The title Manusmriti is a relatively modern term and a late innovation, probably coined because the text is in a verse form. The over fifty manuscripts discovered of the text, never use this title, but state the title as Manava Dharmasastra (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§µ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) in their colophons at the end of each chapter. In modern scholarship, these two titles refer to the same text.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 18-19, 41  Chronology  Eighteenth-century philologists Sir William Jones and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel assigned Manusmriti to the period of around 1250 BCE and 1000 BCE respectively, which from later linguistic developments is untenable due to the language of the text which must be dated later than the late Vedic texts such as the Upanishads which are themselves dated a few centuries later, around 500 BCE. Later scholars, shifted the chronology of the text to between 200 BCE and 200 CE.For composition between 200 BCE and 200 CE see: Avari, p. 142. For dating of composition \\"between the second century BCE and third century CE\\" see: Flood (1996), p. 56. For dating of Manu Smriti in \\"final form\\" to the 2nd century CE, see: Keay, p. 103. For dating as completed some time between 200 BCE and 100 CE see: Hopkins, p. 74. For probable origination during the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD, see: Kulke and Rothermund, p. 85. For the text as preserved dated to around the 1st century BCE. see: Glimpses of Indian Culture, Dinkar Joshi, p.51 Olivelle adds that numismatics evidence, and the mention of gold coins as a fine, suggest that text may date to the 2nd or 3rd century CE.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 24-25 Most scholars consider the text a composite produced by many authors put together over a long period. Olivelle states that the various ancient and medieval Indian texts claim revisions and editions were derived from the original text with 100,000 verses and 1,080 chapters. However, the text version in modern use, according to Olivelle, is likely the work of a single author or a chairman with research assistants. Manusmriti, Olivelle states, was not a new document, it drew on other texts, and it reflects \\"a crystallization of an accumulated knowledge\\" in ancient India. The root of theoretical models within Manusmriti rely on at least two shastras that pre- date it: artha (statecraft and legal process), and dharma (an ancient Indian concept that includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and others discussed in various Dharmasutras older than Manusmriti).Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 41-49 Its contents can be traced to Kalpasutras of the Vedic era, which led to the development of Smartasutras consisting of Grihyasutras and Dharmasutras.John Bowker (2012), The Message and the Book: Sacred Texts of the World's Religions, Yale University Press, , pages 179-180 The foundational texts of Manusmriti include many of these sutras, all from an era preceding the common era. Most of these ancient texts are now lost, and only four of have survived: the law codes of Apastamba, Gautama, Baudhayana and Vasishtha.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras - the law codes of ancient India, Oxford University Press, , pages xxiv-xxv, 280-314 Structure The modern version of the text has been subdivided into twelve Adhyayas (chapters), but the original text had no such division.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 7-8 The text covers different topics, and is unique among ancient Indian texts in using ‚Äútransitional verses‚Äù to mark the end of one subject and the start of the next. The text can be broadly divided into four, each of different length. and each further divided into subsections: #Creation of the world #Source of dharma #The dharma of the four social classes #Law of karma, rebirth and final liberation The text is composed in metric Shlokas (verses), in the form of a dialogue between an exalted teacher and disciples who are eager to learn about the various aspects of dharma.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 25-27 The first 58 verses are attributed by the text to Manu, while the remaining more than two thousand verses are attributed to his student Bhrigu. Olivelle lists the subsections as follows:Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 9-10 =Sources of the law= The Dharmasya Yonih (Sources of the Law) has twenty-four verses, and one transition verse. These verses state what the text considers as the proper and just sources of law: This section of Manusmriti, like other Hindu law texts, includes fourfold sources of Dharma, states Levinson, which include Atmana santushti (satisfaction of one's conscience), Sadachara (local norms of virtuous individuals), Smriti and Sruti.David Levinson (2002), Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volume 1, SAGE Publications, , page 829Werner Menski, Hindu Law: Beyond Tradition and Modernity (Delhi: Oxford UP, 2003), p.126 and Domenico Francavilla, The Roots of Hindu Jurisprudence: Sources of Dharma and Interpretation in Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ and Dharma≈õƒÅstra.

Olivelle notes instances of likely interpolation and insertions in the notes to this section, in both the presumed vulgate version and the critical edition.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 237-350, 914-982 =Determination of Karmayoga= The verses 12.1, 12.2 and 12.82 are transitional verses. This section is in a different style than the rest of the text, raising questions whether this entire chapter was added later. While there is evidence that this chapter was extensively redacted over time, however it is unclear whether the entire chapter is of a later era. :*4.1 Fruits of Action (12.3-81) (section on actions and consequences, personal responsibility, action as a means of moksha ‚Äì the highest personal bliss)Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 10, 17-19, 230-236, 290-292 :*4.2 Rules of Action for Supreme Good (12.83-115) (section on karma, duties and responsibilities as a means of supreme good) The closing verses of Manusmriti declares, Contents The structure and contents of the Manusmriti suggest it to be a document predominantly targeted at the Brahmins (priestly class) and the Kshatriyas (king, administration and warrior class). The text dedicates 1,034 verses, the largest portion, on laws for and expected virtues of Brahmins, and 971 verses for Kshatriyas.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 41 The statement of rules for the Vaishyas (merchant class) and the Shudras (artisans and working class) in the text is extraordinarily brief. Olivelle suggests that this may be because the text was composed to address the balance \\"between the political power and the priestly interests\\", and because of the rise in foreign invasions of India in the period it was composed.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 16, 62-65 =On virtues and outcast= Manusmriti lists and recommends virtues in many verses. For example, verse 6.75 recommends non-violence towards everyone and temperance as key virtues,The Laws of Manu 6.75 George B√ºhler (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 25, Oxford University Press, page 212J Duncan M Derrett (1975), Bharuci's commentary on the Manusmrti, Schriftenreihe des Sudasien-Instituts der Universitat Heidelberg, , page 23 while verse 10.63 preaches that all four varnas must abstain from injuring any creature, abstain from falsehood and abstain from appropriating property of others.The Laws of Manu 10.63 George B√ºhler (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 25, Oxford University Press, page 416Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 208-214, 337 Similarly, in verse 4.204, states Olivelle, some manuscripts of Manusmriti list the recommended virtues to be, \\"compassion, forbearance, truthfulness, non-injury, self-control, not desiring, meditation, serenity, sweetness and honesty\\" as primary, and \\"purification, sacrifices, ascetic toil, gift giving, Vedic recitation, restraining the sexual organs, observances, fasts, silence and bathing\\" as secondary.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 275 A few manuscripts of the text contain a different verse 4.204, according to Olivelle, and list the recommended virtues to be, \\"not injuring anyone, speaking the truth, chastity, honesty and not stealing\\" as central and primary, while \\"not being angry, obedience to the teacher, purification, eating moderately and vigilance\\" to desirable and secondary. In other discovered manuscripts of Manusmriti, including the most translated Calcutta manuscript, the text declares in verse 4.204 that the ethical precepts under Yamas such as Ahimsa (non-violence) are paramount while Niyamas such as Ishvarapranidhana (contemplation of personal god) are minor, and those who do not practice the Yamas but obey the Niyamas alone become outcasts.The Laws of Manu 4.204 George B√ºhler (translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 25, Oxford University Press, page 160-161J Duncan M Derrett (1975), Bharuci's commentary on the Manusmrti, Schriftenreihe des Sudasien-Instituts der Universitat Heidelberg, , pages 30, 439-440 =On personal choices, behaviours and morals= Manusmriti has numerous verses on duties a person has towards himself and to others, thus including moral codes as well as legal codes.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-32 This is similar to, states Olivelle, the modern contrast between informal moral concerns to birth out of wedlock in the developed nations, along with simultaneous legal protection for children who are born out of wedlock. Personal behaviours covered by the text are extensive. For example, verses 2.51-2.56, recommend that a monk must go on his begging round, collect alms food and present it to his teacher first, then eat. One should revere whatever food one gets and eat it without disdain, states Manusmriti, but never overeat, as eating too much harms health.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 97 In verse 5.47, the text states that work becomes without effort when a man contemplates, undertakes and does what he loves to do and when he does so without harming any creature.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 140 Numerous verses relate to the practice of meat eating, how it causes injury to living beings, why it is evil, and the morality of vegetarianism. Yet, the text balances its moral tone as an appeal to one's conscience, states Olivelle. For example, verse 5.56 as translated by Olivelle states, \\"there is no fault in eating meat, in drinking liquor, or in having sex; that is the natural activity of creatures. Abstaining from such activity, however, brings greatest rewards.\\"Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-32, 138-147, 558-593 =On rights of women= Manusmriti offers an inconsistent and internally conflicting perspective on women's rights. The text, for example, declares that a marriage cannot be dissolved by a woman or a man, in verse 8.101-8.102.Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , page 84 Yet, the text, in other sections, allows either to dissolve the marriage. For example, verses 9.72-9.81 allow the man or the woman to get out of a fraudulent marriage or an abusive marriage, and remarry; the text also provides legal means for a woman to remarry when her husband has been missing or has abandoned her.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 190-207, 746-809 It preaches chastity to widows such as in verses 5.158-5.160, opposes a woman marrying someone outside her own social class as in verses 3.13-3.14.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-32, 108-123, 138-147 In other verses, such as 2.67-2.69 and 5.148-5.155, Manusmriti preaches that as a girl, she should obey and seek protection of her father, as a young woman her husband, and as a widow her son; and that a woman should always worship her husband as a god.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 98, 146-147 In verses 3.55-3.56, Manusmriti also declares that \\"women must be honored and adorned\\", and \\"where women are revered, there the gods rejoice; but where they are not, no sacred rite bears any fruit\\".Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 111Sanskrit: ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§™‡•Ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§∞‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§§‡§æ‡§É ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•à‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§® ‡§™‡•Ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§´‡§≤‡§æ‡§É ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É The Laws of Manu 3.55-3.56 George B√ºhler (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 25, Oxford University Press, page 85 Elsewhere, in verses 5.147-5.148, states Olivelle, the text declares, \\"a woman must never seek to live independently\\".Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 146 Simultaneously, states Olivelle, the text presupposes numerous practices such as marriages outside one's varna (see anuloma and pratiloma), such as between a Brahmin man and a Shudra woman in verses 9.149-9.157, a widow getting pregnant with a child of a man she is not married to in verses 9.57-9.62, marriage where a woman in love elopes with her man, and then grants legal rights in these cases such as property inheritance rights in verses 9.143-9.157, and the legal rights of the children so born.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-32, 194-207, 755-809 The text also presumes that a married woman may get pregnant by a man other than her husband, and dedicates verses 8.31-8.56 to conclude that the child's custody belongs to the woman and her legal husband, and not to the man she got pregnant with.Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , pages 83-84Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 182-193, 659-706 Manusmriti provides a woman with property rights to six types of property in verses 9.192-9.200. These include those she received at her marriage, or as gift when she eloped or when she was taken away, or as token of love before marriage, or as gifts from her biological family, or as received from her husband subsequent to marriage, and also from inheritance from deceased relatives.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 200-201, 746-809 Flavia Agnes states that Manusmriti is a complex commentary from women's rights perspective, and the British colonial era codification of women's rights based on it for Hindus, and from Islamic texts for Muslims, picked and emphasised certain aspects while it ignored other sections.Flavia Agnes (2001), Law and Gender Inequality: The Politics of Women's Rights in India, Oxford University Press, , pages 41-45 This construction of personal law during the colonial era created a legal fiction around Manusmriti's historic role as a scripture in matters relating to women in South Asia.Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im (2010), Islam and the Secular State, Harvard University Press, , pages 149, 289 =On statecraft and rules of war= Chapter 7 of the Manusmriti discusses the duties of a king, what virtues he must have, what vices he must avoid. In verses 7.54 - 7.76, the text identifies precepts to be followed in selecting ministers, ambassadors and officials, as well as the characteristics of well fortified capital. Manusmriti then lays out the laws of just war, stating that first and foremost, war should be avoided by negotiations and reconciliations. If war becomes necessary, states Manusmriti, a soldier must never harm civilians, non-combatants or someone who has surrendered, that use of force should be proportionate, and other rules. Fair taxation guidelines are described in verses 7.127 to 7.137.Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , pages 81-82Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 154-166, 613-658 Authenticity and inconsistencies in various manuscripts Patrick Olivelle, credited with a 2005 translation of Manusmriti published by the Oxford University Press, states the concerns in postmodern scholarship about the presumed authenticity and reliability of Manusmriti manuscripts. He writes (abridged), Other scholars point to the inconsistencies and have questioned the authenticity of verses, and the extent to which verses were changed, inserted or interpolated into the original, at a later date. Sinha, for example, states that less than half, or only 1,214 of the 2,685 verses in Manusmriti, may be authentic. Further, the verses are internally inconsistent.Arun Kumbhare (2009), Women of India: Their Status Since the Vedic Times, , page 56 Verses such as 3.55-3.62 of Manusmriti, for example, glorify the position of women, while verse such as 9.3 and 9.17 do the opposite.J Sinha (2014), Psycho-Social Analysis of the Indian Mindset, Springer Academic, , page 5 Other passages found in Manusmriti, such as those relating to Ganesha, are modern era insertions and forgeries. Robert E. Van Voorst states that the verses from 3.55-60 may be about respect given to a woman in her home, but within a strong patriarchal system. Nelson in 1887, in a legal brief before the Madras High Court of British India, had stated, \\"there are various contradictions and inconsistencies in the Manu Smriti itself, and that these contradictions would lead one to conclude that such a commentary did not lay down legal principles to be followed but were merely recommendatory in nature.\\"G Srikantan (2014), Entanglements in Legal History (Editor: Thomas Duve), Max Planck Institute: Germany, , page 123 Mahatma Gandhi remarked on the observed inconsistencies within Manusmriti as follows, Commentaries There are numerous classical commentaries on the ' written in the medieval period. BhƒÅruci is the oldest known commentator on the '. Kane places him in the late 10th or early 11th century,Kane, P. V., History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra, (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part I, 566. Olivelle places him in the 8th century,Olivelle, Patrick, \\"Dharma≈õƒÅstra: A Literary History\\", page 29. and Derrett places him between 600-800 CE.J Duncan M Derrett (1975), Bharuci's commentary on the Manusmrti, Schriftenreihe des Sudasien-Instituts der Universitat Heidelberg, From these three opinions we can place BhƒÅruci anywhere from the early 7th century CE to the early 11th century CE. BhƒÅruci's commentary, titled Manu-sastra-vivarana, has far fewer number of verses than the Kull≈´ka-Calcutta vulgate version in circulation since the British colonial era, and it refers to more ancient texts that are believed to be lost. It is also called Raja-Vimala, and J Duncan M Derrett states Bharuci was \\"occasionally more faithful to his source's historical intention\\" than other commentators.J Duncan J Derrett (1977), Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law, Brill Academic, , pages 10-17, 36-37 with footnote 75a MedhƒÅtithi commentary on ' has been widely studied. Scholars such as Buhler, Kane, and Lingat believe he was from north India, likely the Kashmir region. His commentary on Manusmriti is estimated to be from 9th to 11th century.Kane, P. V., History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra, (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part II, 583. GovindarƒÅja's commentary, titled Manutika, is an 11th-century commentary on Manusmriti, referred to by Jimutavahana and Laksmidhara, and was plagiarised by Kull≈´ka, states Olivelle. Kull≈´ka's commentary, titled Manvarthamuktavali, along with his version of the Manusmrti manuscript has been \\"vulgate\\" or default standard, most studied version, since it was discovered in 18th-century Calcutta by the British colonial officials. It is the most reproduced and famous, not because, according to Olivelle, it is the oldest or because of its excellence, but because it was the lucky version found first. The Kull≈´ka commentary dated to be sometime between the 13th to 15th century, adds Olivelle, is mostly a plagiary of Govindaraja commentary from about the 11th century, but with Kull≈´ka's criticism of Govindaraja.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 367-369 NƒÅrƒÅyana's commentary, titled Manvarthavivrtti, is probably from the 14th century and little is known about the author. This commentary includes many variant readings, and Olivelle found it useful in preparing a critical edition of the Manusmriti text in 2005. Nandana was from south India, and his commentary, titled Nandini, provides a useful benchmark on Manusmriti version and its interpretation in the south. Other known medieval era commentaries on Manusmriti include those by Sarvajnanarayana, Raghavananda and Ramacandra.Visvanath Narayan Mandlik (1886), Manavadharma≈õastram, 5 volumes, Significance and role in history =In ancient and medieval India= Scholars doubt Manusmriti was ever administered as law text in ancient or medieval Hindu society. David Buxbaum states, \\"in the opinion of the best contemporary orientalists, it [Manusmriti] does not, as a whole, represent a set of rules ever actually administered in Hindustan. It is in great part an ideal picture of that which, in the view of a Brahmin, ought to be law\\".David Buxbaum (1998), Family Law and Customary Law in Asia: A Contemporary Legal Perspective, Springer Academic, , page 204 Donald Davis writes, \\"there is no historical evidence for either an active propagation or implementation of Dharmasastra [Manusmriti] by a ruler or any state ‚Äì as distinct from other forms of recognizing, respecting and using the text. Thinking of Dharmasastra as a legal code and of its authors as lawgivers is thus a serious misunderstanding of its history\\".Donald Davis (2010), The Spirit of Hindu Law, Cambridge University Press, , page 14 Other scholars have expressed the same view, based on epigraphical, archaeological and textual evidence from medieval Hindu kingdoms in Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, while acknowledging that Manusmriti was influential to the South Asian history of law and was a theoretical resource.Werner Menski (2009), Hindu Law: Beyond Tradition and Modernity, Oxford University Press, , Chapters 2 & 4Donald R Davis Jr (2005), Intermediate Realms of Law: Corporate Groups and Rulers in Medieval India, Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, Volume 48, Issue 1, pages 92‚Äì117 =In British India= Prior to the British colonial rule, Sharia (Islamic law) for Muslims in South Asia had been codified as Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, but laws for non-Muslims ‚Äì such as Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis ‚Äì were not codified during the 600 years of Islamic rule. With the arrival of the British colonial officials, Manusmriti played a historic role in constructing a legal system for non-Muslims in South Asia and early Western perceptions about the ancient and medieval Indian society. In the 18th century, the earliest British of the East India Company acted as agents of the Mughal emperor. As the British colonial rule took over the political and administrative powers in India, it was faced with various state responsibilities such as legislative and judiciary functions.Tomothy Lubin et al (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Lubin and Davis), Cambridge University Press, , Chapter 1 The East India Company, and later the British Crown, sought profits for its British shareholders through trade as well as sought to maintain effective political control with minimal military engagement. The administration pursued a path of least resistance, relying upon co-opted local intermediaries that were mostly Muslims and some Hindus in various princely states. The British exercised power by avoiding interference and adapting to law practices as explained by the local intermediaries. The existing legal texts for Muslims, and resurrected Manusmriti manuscript thus helped the colonial state sustain the pre-colonial religious and political law and conflicts, well into the late nineteenth century. The colonial policy on the system of personal laws for India, for example, was expressed by Governor-General Hastings in 1772 as follows, For Muslims of India, the British accepted sharia as the legal code for Muslims, based on texts such the al-Sirjjiyah and Fatawa-i Alamgiri written under sponsorship of Aurangzeb.Michael Anderson (1995), Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader (Studies in Asian Topics, Editors: David Arnold, Peter Robb), Routledge, , Chapter 10; K Ewing (1988), Sharia and ambiguity in South Asian Islam, University of California Press, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im (2010), Islam and the Secular State, Harvard University Press, , pages 149-150A digest of Moohummudan law on the subjects to which it is usually applied by British courts of justice in India Neil Baillie, Smith, Elder & Co. London For Hindus and other non-Muslims such as Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Tribal people, this information was unavailable. The substance of Hindu law, was derived by the British colonial officials from Manusmriti, and it became the first Dharmasastra that was translated in 1794. The British colonial officials, for practice, attempted to extract from the Dharma≈õƒÅstra, the English categories of law and religion for the purposes of colonial administration.Ludo Rocher, \\"Hindu Law and Religion: Where to draw the line?\\" in Malik Ram Felicitation Volume. ed.

Derrett, Religion, Law, and the State in India (London: Faber, 1968), 96; For a related distinction between religious and secular law in Dharma≈õƒÅstra, see The British colonial officials, however, mistook the Manusmriti as codes of law, failed to recognise that it was a commentary on morals and law and not a statement of positive law. The colonial officials of the early 19th century also failed to recognise that Manusmriti was one of many competing Dharmasastra texts, it was not in use for centuries during the Islamic rule period of India. The officials resurrected Manusmriti, constructed statements of positive law from the text for non-Muslims, in order to remain faithful to its policy of using sharia for the South Asian Muslim population.Donald Davis (2010), The Spirit of Hindu Law, Cambridge University Press, , page 13-16, 166-179Ludo Rocher (1978), Hindu Conceptions of Law, Hastings Law Journal, Volume 29, pages 1283-1297 Manusmriti, thus played a role in constructing the Anglo-Hindu law, as well as Western perceptions about ancient and medieval era Hindu culture from the colonial times.For reviews of the British misappropriations of Dharma≈õƒÅstra, see: and Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im states the significance and role of Manusmriti in governing India during the colonial era as follows (abridged), =Outside India= The Dharma-sastras, particularly Manusmriti, states Anthony Reid, were \\"greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of the natural order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)\\".Anthony Reid (1988), Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450-1680: The lands below the winds, Yale University Press, , pages 137-138Victor Lieberman (2014), Burmese Administrative Cycles, Princeton University Press, , pages 66-68; Also see discussion of 13th-century Wagaru Dhamma-sattha / 11th century Manu Dhammathat manuscripts discussionOn Laws of Manu in 14th-century Thailand's Ayuthia kingdom named after Ayodhya, see David Wyatt (2003), Thailand: A Short History, Yale University Press, , page 61; Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , pages 269-272 The medieval era derived texts and Manusmriti manuscripts in Southeast Asia are, however, quite different than the \\"vulgate\\" version that has been in use since its first use in British India. The role of then extant Manusmriti as a historic foundation of law texts for the people of Southeast Asia has been very important, states Hooker. Comparison with other dharmasastras Along with Manusmriti (Manava Dharmasastra), ancient India had between eighteen and thirty six competing Dharma-sastras, states John Bowker. Many of these texts have been lost completely or in parts, but they are referred to in other ancient Indian texts suggesting that they were influential in some regions or time. Of the numerous jurisprudence-related commentaries and Smriti texts, after Manu Smriti and other than the older Dharma Sutras, Yajnavalkya Smriti has attracted the attention of many scholars, followed by Narada Smriti and Parashara Smriti (the oldest Dharma- smriti).M Rama Jois (2004), Legal and Constitutional History of India, Universal Law Publishing, , pages 19-34 Evidence suggests that Yajnavalkya Smriti, state Ghose and other scholars, was the more referred to text than Manu Smriti, in matters of governance and practice. This text, of unclear date of composition, but likely to be a few centuries after Manusmriti, is more \\"concise, methodical, distilled and liberal\\".M Rama Jois (2004), Legal and Constitutional History of India, Universal Law Publishing, , page 31 According to Jois, Jois suggests that the Yajnavalkya Smriti text liberal evolution may have been influenced by Buddhism in ancient India. The Yajnavalkya text is also different from Manu text in adding chapters to the organisation of monasteries, land grants, deeds execution and other matters. The Yajnavalkya text was more referred to by many Hindu kingdoms of the medieval era, as evidenced by the commentary of 12th-century Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara, titled Mitakshara.M Rama Jois (2004), Legal and Constitutional History of India, Universal Law Publishing, , page 32 Modern reception The Manusmrti has been subject to appraisal and criticism.For objections to the work by feminists, see: Avari, pp. 142-143. Among the notable Indian critics of the text in the early 20th century was Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who held Manusmriti as responsible for caste system in India. In protest, Ambedkar burnt Manusmrti in a bonfire on December 25, 1927.Nicholas Dirks (2001), Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of Modern India, Princeton University Press, , pages 266-269 While Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar condemned Manusmriti, Mahatma Gandhi opposed the book burning. The latter stated that while caste discrimination was harmful to spiritual and national growth, it had nothing to do with Hinduism and its texts such as Manusmriti. Gandhi argued that the text recognises different callings and professions, defines not one's rights but one's duties, that all work from that of a teacher to a janitor are equally necessary, and of equal status. Gandhi considered Manusmriti to include lofty teachings but a text with inconsistency and contradictions, whose original text is in no one's possession. He recommended that one must read the entire text, accept those parts of Manusmriti which are consistent with \\"truth and ahimsa (non-injury or non-violence to others)\\" and the rejection of other parts. The Manu Smriti was one of the first Sanskrit texts studied by the European philologists. It was first translated into English by Sir William Jones. His version was published in 1794.For Manu Smriti as one of the first Sanskrit texts noted by the British and translation by Sir William Jones in 1794, see: Flood (1996), p. 56. This interest in its translation was encouraged by British administrative requirements, which they believed to be legal codes. In fact, states Romila Thapar, these were not codes of law but social and ritual texts.For British interest in Dharmashastras due to administrative needs, and their misinterpretation of them as legal codes rather than as social and ritual texts, see: Thapar (2002), pp. 2-3. A Louis Jacolliot translation of the Calcutta version of \\"Law of Manu\\" was reviewed by Friedrich Nietzsche. He commented on it both favourably and unfavorably: :He deemed it \\"an incomparably spiritual and superior work\\" to the Christian Bible, observed that \\"the sun shines on the whole book\\" and attributed its ethical perspective to \\"the noble classes, the philosophers and warriors, [who] stand above the mass.\\"Friedrich Nietzsche, The Antichrist (1888), 56-57. Nietzsche does not advocate a caste system, states David Conway, but endorses the political exclusion conveyed in the Manu text.Daniel Conway (1997), \\"Nietzsche and the Political\\", Routledge, , page 36 Nietzsche considered Manu's social order as far from perfect, but considers the general idea of a caste system to be natural and right, and stated that \\"caste-order, order of rank is just a formula for the supreme law of life itself\\", a \\"natural order, lawfulness par excellence\\".Julian Young (2010), \\"Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography\\", Cambridge University Press, , page 515Nietzsche: The Anti-Christ, Ecce Homo, Twilight of the Idols: And Other Writings, Aaron Ridley, Cambridge University Press, P.58 According to Nietzsche, states Julian Young, \\"Nature, not Manu, separates from each other: predominantly spiritual people, people characterized by muscular and temperamental strength, and a third group of people who are not distinguished in either way, the average\\". He wrote that 'To prepare a book of law in the style of Manu means to give a people the right to become master one day, to become perfect, - to aspire to the highest art of life.' :The Law of Manu was also criticised by Nietzsche. He, states Walter Kaufmann, \\"denounces the way in which the 'Law of Manu' dealt with the outcastes, saying that there is nothing that outrages our feelings more ... .\\"Walter Kaufmann (2013), Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, Princeton University Press, , pages 225-226 Nietzsche wrote, \\"these regulations teach us enough, in them we find for once Aryan humanity, quite pure, quite primordial, we learn that the concept of pure blood is the opposite of a harmless concept.\\"Walter Kaufmann (1980), From Shakespeare to Existentialism, Princeton University Press, , page 215 In his book Revolution and Counter-Revolution in India, leader B. R. Ambedkar asserted that Manu Smriti was written by a sage named Brigu during the times of Pushyamitra of Sangha in connection with social pressures caused by the rise of Buddhism. However, historian Romila Thapar considers these claims to be exaggerations. Thapar writes that archaeological evidence casts doubt on the claims of Buddhist persecution by Pushyamitra.Romila Thapar, A≈õoka and the Decline of the Mauryas, Oxford University Press (1960) p. 200. Support of the Buddhist faith by the Shungas at some point is suggested by an epigraph on the gateway of Bharhut, which mentions its erection \\"during the supremacy of the Shungas\\"John Marshall, \\"An Historical and Artistic Description of Sanchi\\", from A Guide to Sanchi, citing p. 11. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918). Pp. 7-29 on line, Project South Asia. Hinduism does not evangelise.K. V. Rao, Socialism, Secularism, and Democracy in India, pp. 28-30. Nagendra K. Singh, Enforcement of Human Rights in Peace and War and the Future of Humanity, p. 35. Martinus Nijhoff (1986) Pollard et al. state that the code of Manu was derived to answer questions on how men could rebuild their societies following a series of floods. Swami Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj, held the text to be authentic and authoritative.The Light of Truth, Chapter 4 Other admirers of the text have included Annie Besant. Friedrich Nietzsche is noted to have said \\"Close the Bible and open the Manu Smriti. It has an affirmation of life, a triumphing agreeable sensation in life and that to draw up a lawbook such as Manu means to permit oneself to get the upper hand, to become perfection, to be ambitious of the highest art of living.\\"Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power, vol. 1.

It is commonly known as the Kreutzer Sonata after the violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, to whom it was ultimately dedicated, but who thoroughly disliked the piece and refused to play it. Composition In the composer's 1803 sketchbook the work was titled \\"Sonata per il Pianoforte ed uno violino obligato in uno stile molto concertante come d‚Äôun concerto\\".\\"George Augustus Polgreen Bridgetower (1780-1860)\\". AfriClassical.com. January 27, 2015. The final movement of the work was originally written for another, earlier, sonata for violin and piano by Beethoven, the Sonata No. 6, Op. 30, No. 1, in A major. Beethoven gave no key designation to the work. Although the work is usually titled as being in A major, the Austrian composer and music theoretician Gerhard Pr√§sent has published articles indicating that the main key is in fact A minor.\\"THE STRAD\\" Oct.1999, p. 1023: \\"The Kreutzer was not written in A major\\"/Gerhard Pr√§sent, London Premiere and dedication The sonata was originally dedicated to the violinist George Bridgetower (1778-1860) as \\"Sonata mulattica composta per il mulatto Brischdauer [Bridgetower], gran pazzo e compositore mulattico\\" (Mulatto Sonata composed for the mulatto Brischdauer, great madman mulatto composer). Shortly after completion the work was premiered by Bridgetower and Beethoven on 24 May 1803 at the Augarten Theatre at a concert that started at the unusually early hour of 8:00 am. Bridgetower sight-read the sonata; he had never seen the work before, and there had been no time for any rehearsal. After the premiere performance Beethoven and Bridgetower fell out: while the two were drinking, Bridgetower apparently insulted the morals of a woman whom Beethoven cherished. Enraged, Beethoven removed the dedication of the piece, dedicating it instead to Rodolphe Kreutzer, who was considered the finest violinist of the day.Thayer, Thayer's Life of Beethoven, ed.Elliot Forbes, Princeton University Press, 1993, 332-333. Structure The piece is in three movements, and takes approximately 43 minutes to perform: #Adagio sostenuto ‚Äì Presto (A major ‚Äì A minor, sonata form, about 15 minutes in length) #:The sonata opens with a slow 18-bar introduction, of which only the first four bars of the solo violin are in the A-Major-key. The piano enters, and the harmony begins to turn darker towards the minor key, until the main body of the movement ‚Äî an angry A-minor Presto‚Äî begins. Here, the piano part matches the violin's in terms of difficulty. Near the end, Beethoven brings back part of the opening Adagio, before closing the movement in an anguished coda. #Andante con variazioni (F major, variation form, with the third variation in F minor, about 18 minutes) #:There could hardly be a greater contrast with the second movement, a placid tune in F major followed by five distinctive variations. The first variation transliterates the theme into a lively triple meter while embellishing it with trills, while in the second the violin steals the melody and enlivens it even further. The third variation, in F minor, returns to a darker and more meditative state. The fourth recalls the first and second variations with its light, ornamental, and airy feel. The fifth and final variation, the longest, caps the movement with a slower and more dramatic feel, nevertheless returning to the carefree F major. #Presto (A major, sonata form, about 10 minutes) #:The calm is broken by a crashing A major chord in the piano, ushering in the virtuosic and exuberant third movement, a 6/8 tarantella in sonata form. After moving through a series of slightly contrasting episodes, the theme returns for the last time, and the work ends jubilantly in a rush of A major. Reception Kreutzer Sonata, painting by Ren√© Fran√ßois Xavier Prinet (1901), based on Leo Tolstoy's 1889 novella, The Kreutzer Sonata After its successful premiere in 1803 the work was published in 1805 as Beethoven's Op. 47, with its re-dedication to Rudolphe Kreutzer, which gave the composition its nickname. Kreutzer never performed the work, considering it \\"outrageously unintelligible\\". He did not particularly care for any of Beethoven's music, and they only ever met once, briefly.\\"The Power and the Passion.\\" Strings Magazine, January 2009, p. 42 Referring to Beethoven's composition, Leo Tolstoy's novella The Kreutzer Sonata was first published in 1889. That novella was adapted in various stage and film productions, contributing to Beethoven's composition becoming known to the general public. Rita Dove's 2009 Sonata Mulattica reimagined the life of Bridgetower, the sonata's original dedicatee, in poetry, thus writing about the sonata that connected the composer and the violinist who first performed it.Rita Dove.

Glaus played in Major League Baseball with the Anaheim Angels (‚Äì), Arizona Diamondbacks (), Toronto Blue Jays (‚Äì), St. Louis Cardinals (‚Äì), and the Atlanta Braves (). Glaus lettered in baseball while attending UCLA. He was a four-time All-Star and won World Series MVP honors in . Professional career In thirteen seasons Glaus hit .254 with 320 home runs and 950 RBI in 1537 games. In 19 postseason games, he hit .347 with nine home runs and 16 RBI. Glaus has been selected to four All- Star Games, three with the Angels and one with the Blue Jays. =Anaheim Angels= Garret Anderson (left) and Troy Glaus in 2002. Glaus began his career with the Angels in and was installed as the team's starting third baseman in . Glaus had a breakout season in , becoming the all-time single season home run leader in Angels history with 47 while leading third baseman in adjusted range factor (2.95) in 2000. Glaus participated in the 2001 MLB All-Star Game and posted his second consecutive 40 home run season with 41 on the year. In , Glaus failed to reach the 40 home run club for the first time since the 1999 season, but he managed to hit thirty home runs in helping the Angels make the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in 7 games to win their first World Series title in team history. Glaus was a key member of the Angels' 2002 World Series championship team and was named the Most Valuable Player of that series. Glaus followed that up with another All-Star year in . Glaus missed much of the season with a shoulder injury. 2004 was the last year of his contract with the Angels. As an established veteran, he was in demand on the free agent market and able to field lucrative offers for long term contracts. Although Glaus had spent his entire career an Angel, and was a fan favorite, the team decided not to pursue Glaus' return. Amid concerns about Glaus' future health after his injury, the team decided to go with the much lower-priced alternative of turning the third base position over to young prospect Dallas McPherson, whom they felt had a good chance to soon become as productive as Glaus had been. Glaus ultimately signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks for US$45 million over four years. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Glaus worked through his back problems in the season, with the Diamondbacks, by hitting 37 HRs (tops amongst 3Bs) with 97 RBIs. He also led the league in adjusted range factor (2.92), but his 24 errors tied him with David Wright for the most errors by a third baseman in the Major Leagues, and he had a Major League-low .946 fielding percentage at third. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the off-season along with minor league shortstop Sergio Santos. The trade sent pitcher Miguel Batista and second baseman Orlando Hudson to the Diamondbacks. The Jays badly needed a power bat a year after letting go of Carlos Delgado, however the emergence of Hudson at second base gave the statistical advantage of this trade to the Diamondbacks. =Toronto Blue Jays= Glaus with the Blue Jays in 2007 spring training Although Glaus was converted from shortstop to third base in the minors (and played 10 games at shortstop for the Angels), he started at shortstop for the Toronto Blue Jays against the Chicago White Sox on May 26, due to the demotion of shortstop Russ Adams. Glaus was not expected to do much fielding due to the fact the pitcher that day was known to induce many fly balls, instead of ground balls. This defensive alignment didn't affect his hitting, collecting 2 hits with a home run. Since then, Glaus made several starts at shortstop, usually when Toronto was facing National League opponents at their home ballpark, where there is no DH. After hitting 38 home runs and 104 RBI in the 2006 season, Glaus earned a single 10th place vote for the 2006 American League MVP Award. In 2006, Glaus had the lowest zone rating of any Major League third baseman (.741). In Glaus's production was hampered all year by foot injuries and his production fell. On December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report. =St. Louis Cardinals= Glaus was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for fellow third baseman Scott Rolen on January 14, 2008. This worked out well for the Cardinals, as Glaus did about as well as, or better than, his career rates in most offensive categories. Furthermore, Glaus committed only 7 errors in 146 games and led the league with a .982 fielding percentage at 3B. On September 3, 2008, he hit his 300th career home run off Doug Davis of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the third inning. He underwent arthroscopic right shoulder surgery on January 21, . The Cardinals initially expected him to be ready around the start of 2009 season, but after a setback in his rehabilitation he was placed on the 15-day DL; after another reassessment the Cardinals announced that they did not expect him to return until June 2009.Cardinals Push Back Timing of Glaus Return Yahoo! Sports, April 1, 2009 On July 11, 2009 he was assigned to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League on a rehabilitation assignment. He returned September 2, against the Brewers in the bottom of the 6th inning. =Atlanta Braves= Following an injury-shortened 2009 season with the St. Louis Cardinals, Glaus signed a one-year $1.75 million contract with the Atlanta Braves, a deal that allows him to earn an additional $2.25 million in performance and roster bonuses. He became the starting first baseman in 2010. After a rough April in which he hit below the Mendoza Line, Glaus rebounded to become Player of the Month in May, hitting .330 with 6 home runs and 28 RBI. As of August 9, Glaus was hitting .242 with 14 home runs and 63 RBI. Glaus's production faltered in July and August. After Atlanta acquired Derrek Lee on August 18 to play 1st base, Glaus was placed on the DL with knee fatigue. Glaus had a few setbacks, but returned to Atlanta in a back-up role behind Derrek Lee and rookie Freddie Freeman. Glaus made only one appearance at 3rd base during the regular season, but was used at 3rd in game 2 of the NLDS against the San Francisco Giants starting a key double play. Glaus then started game four of the series at 3rd. Post-playing career Glaus became a candidate for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum for the first time on November 9, 2015. He received no votes. Family Glaus resides in Ocala, Florida, with his wife, Ann. He also has one son, Ty.

History The first dissemination of game scores via electronic means was done by telegraph, starting in the 1890s. In Montreal's Victoria Rink, telegraph lines were installed to send game descriptions to operators in Winnipeg for the 1896 Stanley Cup challenge between Montreal and Winnipeg. On February 8, 1923 the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game was made. Toronto Daily Star reporter Norman Albert described the third-period action of a game between Midland and North Toronto at Toronto's Arena Gardens. The radio station was CFCA, owned by the newspaper. The station also carried the first NHL radio broadcast on February 14, 1923, with the broadcast of the third-period of a game between the Toronto St. Patricks and the Ottawa Senators at the same arena.Kitchen, p.246 The first complete hockey game carried over the radio was on February 22, 1923 on CJCG out of Winnipeg of a game between the Winnipeg Falcons and the Port Arthur Bearcats. The first complete broadcast of a professional game was made on March 14, 1923 on CKCK out of Regina, Saskatchewan and reported by Pete Parker. The game was not an NHL contest, but rather a Western Canada Hockey League featuring the Regina Capitals. The first hockey game televised in Canada was on October 11, 1952 of a game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings, played at the Montreal Forum, a few weeks after television arrived in Canada. However, the 1952 Memorial Cup finals, taking place several months before the inauguration of TV broadcasting in Canada, were televised on a closed-circuit basis to CBC Television's offices, using equipment leased from NBC in New York. Foster Hewitt was play-by-play commentator for the test run, so network and ad executives could see how well hockey could be televised. As in other sports, television has had a major effect on hockey. The infusion of money has made the major leagues far more professional with vastly higher salaries for players. It has also changed the game as NHL rules now mandate three commercial breaks per period, giving players time to recuperate and allowing the better players to be on the ice longer. However, it also lengthens and slows the games considerably. Games today are also broadcast over the Internet. The NHL websiteNHL.com - The National Hockey League Web Site allows fans to listen to online broadcasts of every NHL game. =Asia= Yes TV's All Sports Network signed a multi-year deal with the NHL to broadcast over 130 regular season games, beginning in the 2008‚Äì09 NHL season to broadcast NHL All-Star games, Stanley Cup playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals, as well as NHL highlight programs. =Canada= In Canada, NHL hockey is broadcast every Saturday night on CBC's longest-running television show, Hockey Night in Canada. During the week, other games are shown on cable channels TSN and RDS. Various local channels carry other games as well. During the NHL playoffs, CBC carries four of the Conference Quarterfinals (first, second, fourth, and sixth choice), two of the Conference semi-finals (first and third choice), all games of one conference final and games 4-7 of the other (or all games if involving a Canadian team). TSN gets the remainder. CBC also carries many international tournaments, such as the World Cup of Hockey. The Winter Olympics in 1998, 2002 and 2006 were on CBC, but the 2010 games were on CTV and RDS. Major games like those of the 1972 Summit Series or the 2002 Winter Olympics have received some of the highest ratings in Canadian television history. Other well-known tournaments, like the Spengler Cup or the Memorial Cup, are carried on Rogers Sportsnet. TSN and RDS carry all IIHF events, such as the World Junior Championships and World Championships. Several Canadian Hockey League (CHL; the umbrella organization for Canada's junior hockey leagues) and American Hockey League (AHL) games are broadcast by local channels in Canada, as is the occasional university game. Hockey Night in Canada, or HNIC, is by far CBC's most profitable show and supports many of the corporation's other ventures. =United States= According to Foster Hewitt's book His Own Story the first TV hockey broadcasts occurred in the late 1940s in New York and Detroit as Foster was interviewed as a hockey guest in both cities. Foster Hewitt His Own Story by Foster Hewitt, The Ryerson Press, 1967 page 101Hockey hasn't traditionally fared as well on American television compared to the NBA, MLB, or the NFL. In fact, hockey broadcasting on a national scale was spotty prior to 1981; NBC and CBS held rights at various times, but neither network carried anything close to a full schedule, even carrying only selected games of the Stanley Cup Finals. From 1971‚Äì1995, there was no exclusive coverage of games in the United States. In 1981, the fledgling USA Network (formerly MSG Network) carried 35 regular-season games a year and a full schedule of playoff games through 1985, supplanted by ESPN in 1985 and SportsChannel in 1989. ESPN regained the national hockey contract in 1993, joined by the Fox network in 1995. Fox had put much effort into trying to stimulate American interests in the game, but had achieved little success. One of their schemes was to make the hockey puck more visible by highlighting it on television with a blue comet, using FoxTrax. When a slapshot over 70 miles per hour was made, the puck would leave a red comet trail on the television. This idea was met with great derision in Canada, especially to diehard hockey fans, and also met with little success in the United States, often ridiculed by comedians on both sides of the border. Fox got out of the hockey business in 1999 after being massively outbid - surprisingly, given Fox's low ratings - by ESPN's fellow Disney network ABC. This $600 million contract was signed in 1998 and was regarded as a failure. Before the 2004‚Äì05 lockout, the NHL had reached two separate deals with NBC and ESPN. The NBC deal stipulated that the network would pay the league no rights fees - an unheard of practice to that point. NBC's deal included six regular season windows, seven postseason broadcasts and games 3‚Äì7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in primetime. The contracts were to commence when the lockout ended. The NBC deal was to expire after the 2006‚Äì07 season, but NBC picked up the option to renew for the 2007‚Äì08 season (Just like the AFL/NBC agreement, which the network did not renew in 2006). The NHL and NBC share in revenues from advertising. ESPN had a two-year deal that they opted out of after the lockout, leaving the NHL without a cable partner. In August 2005, Comcast (who owns the Philadelphia Flyers) paid $70 million a year for three years to put games on the OLN network, now known as Versus. Versus is now known as the NBC Sports Network. Due to the abbreviated off- season, the 2005‚Äì06 schedule did not offer OLN exclusivity, which they received in 2006‚Äì07. NBC Sports Network will also cover the playoffs and will exclusively air Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals. The NHL's American television popularity has been increasing since the debut of the NHL Winter Classic in 2008; the Winter Classic has earned Nielsen ratings on par with those the league had in 1975, when there were far fewer channels and much less audience fracturing. Minor league hockey has more limited national coverage; the America One network currently holds broadcast rights to select games in the American Hockey League and the ECHL, the two top minor leagues in North America. Individual teams (both major and minor, though far more common in the major leagues) have long contracted to air their games on local channels, primarily on Regional sports networks and in a few cases on broadcast channels as well. Collegiate hockey's television coverage has expanded in the late 2000s, with national networks CSTV, and ESPNU carrying numerous regular-season contests. ESPNU airs the NCAA's Division I tournament (with the semifinals airing on ESPN2 and the final game on ESPN), and CSTV carries games from other levels' tournaments. Regular-season games can also be found on specialty channels Big Ten Network and Fox College Sports, along with Midwest regional sports networks FSN North, FSN Wisconsin, and FSN Detroit. =Europe= In 2004, the NHL announced that games would be broadcast across the European continent on the ESPN America as part of a four-year deal that would also include live streaming of games across the Internet.The Canadian Press - NHL signs European TV deal The league previously had agreements with the Galaxie network of the Czech Republic and NTV's TV7 channel in Russia.Sport Business - NHL ties up eastern European TV deals References * External links *NHL Television Broadcasting *Puck The Media *NHL U.S. Broadcast Deals * Category:Olympics on television ","title":"Ice hockey broadcasting"},{"id":"1260885","text":"The Nesomyidae are a family of African rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. It includes several subfamilies, all of which are native to either continental Africa or to Madagascar. Included in this family are Malagasy rats and mice, climbing mice, African rock mice, swamp mice, pouched rats, and the white-tailed rat. Characteristics Nesomyids are small- to medium-sized rodents, with the largest being the size of a rat. Physically, they may resemble mice, rats, voles, or hamsters, depending on the species and subfamily. Their diets vary from fairly strict herbivory to nearly pure insectivory. Their habits are similarly variable, with some species climbing trees, and others burrowing in the ground. They give birth to up to four young after a gestation period around six weeks. Classification Many of these animals were once thought to be related to other groups of muroid rodents, but this African-based clade has been proposed and confirmed on the basis of genetic studies. Such alternate arrangement include the pouched rats in the family Muridae, and the white-tailed rat in the family Cricetidae. Likewise, all members of the Nesomyidae are often placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea. Nesomyids are classified in six subfamilies, 21 genera, and 68 species.

As a journalist for The New York Times and Esquire magazine during the 1960s, Talese helped to define contemporary literary journalism. Talese's most famous articles are about Joe DiMaggio and Frank Sinatra.  Early life  Nan Talese and Gay Talese at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival. Born in Ocean City, New Jersey, the son of Italian immigrant parents, Talese graduated from Ocean City High School in 1949.\\"The ultimate New Jersey high school yearbook: T‚ÄìZ and also...\\", The Star-Ledger, June 27, 1999. Retrieved August 4, 2007.  Writer origins  = High school = Talese's entry into writing was entirely happenstance, and the unintended consequence of the then high school sophomore's attempt to gain more playing time for the baseball team. The assistant coach had the duty of telephoning in the chronicle of each game to the local newspaper and when he complained he was too busy to do it properly, the head coach gave Talese the duty. As Talese recalls in his 1996 memoir Origins of a Nonfiction Writer: After only seven sports articles, Talese was given his own column for the weekly Ocean City Sentinel-Ledger. By the time Talese left for college during September 1949, he had written some 311 stories and columns for the Sentinel- Ledger. Talese credits his mother as the role model he followed in developing the interviewing techniques that would serve him well later in life, interviewing such varied subjects as mafia members and middle-class Americans on their sexual habits. He relates in A Writer's Life: = College = Talese at home in 2007. His selection of a major was, as he described it, a moot choice. \\"I chose journalism as my college major because that is what I knew,\\" he recalls, \\"but I really became a student of history.\\" At university, he became a brother of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. It was here that Talese would begin to employ literary devices more well known for fiction, such as establishing the \\"scene\\" with minute details, and beginning articles in medias res (Latin for \\"into the midst of things\\"). During his junior year, Talese became the sports editor for the campus newspaper, Crimson-White, and started a column he dubbed \\"Sports Gay-zing\\", for which he wrote on November 7, 1951: This was before Lillian Ross did the same in Picture (1952) or Truman Capote used the technique in The Muses Are Heard (1956). More importantly, Talese included among his subjects both the \\"losers\\" and the unnoticed. He was more interested in those who did not attain the glory of winning and less in hero- worshipping the winners.  Professional career  = Newspaper reporter = After graduating during June 1953, Talese relocated to New York City, yet could only find work as a copyboy. The job was, however, at the esteemed New York Times and Talese arrived for his mundane position nevertheless in handstitched Italian suits. Talese was eventually able to get an article published in the Times, albeit unsigned (without credit). In \\"Times Square Anniversary\\" (November 2, 1953), Talese interviewed the man, Herbert Kesner, Broadcast Editor, who was responsible for managing the headlines that flash across the famous marquee above Times Square. Talese followed this with an article in the February 21, 1954 edition, concerning the chairs used on the boardwalk of Atlantic City (something with which he was familiar as his home town of Ocean City is the next hamlet south of the gambling mecca). Yet, his budding journalism career would have to be put on hold ‚Äì Talese was drafted into the United States Army in 1954. Talese had been required (as were all male students at the time owing to the Korean War) to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and had relocated to New York awaiting his eventual commission as a second lieutenant. Talese was sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky, to train in the Tank Corps. Finding his mechanical skills lacking, Talese was transferred to the Office of Public Information where he once again worked for a local newspaper, Inside the Turret, and soon had his own column, \\"Fort Knox Confidential\\". When Talese completed his military obligation during 1956, he was rehired by the New York Times as a sports reporter. Talese later opined, \\"Sports is about people who lose and lose and lose. They lose games; then they lose their jobs. It can be very intriguing.\\" Of the various fields, boxing had the most appeal for Talese, largely because it was about individuals engaged in contests and those individuals in the mid to late 1950s were becoming predominately non-white at the prizefight level. He wrote 38 articles about Floyd Patterson alone. For this, Talese was rewarded with a promotion to the Times' Albany Bureau to cover state politics. It was a short- lived assignment, however, as Talese's exacting habits and meticulous style soon irritated his new editors so much that they recalled him to the city, assigning him to write minor obituaries. Talese puts it, \\"I was banished to the obituary desk as punishment ‚Äì to break me. There were major obituaries and minor obituaries. I was sent to write minor obituaries not even seven paragraphs long.\\" After a year working for the Times obituary section, he began to write articles for the Sunday Times, which was then managed as a separate organization from the daily Times by editor Lester Markel. = Magazine reporter = Talese's first piece for the magazine Esquire ‚Äì a series of scenes in the city ‚Äì appeared in a special New York issue during July 1960. When the Times newspaper unions had a work stoppage during December 1962, Talese had plenty of time to watch rehearsals for a production by Broadway director Joshua Logan for an Esquire profile. As Carol Polsgrove indicates in her history of Esquire during the 1960s, it was the kind of reporting he liked to do best: \\"just being there, observing, waiting for the climactic moment when the mask would drop and true character would reveal itself.\\" In 1964, Talese published The Bridge: The Building of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, a reporter-style, non-fiction depiction of the construction of the Verrazzano- Narrows Bridge in New York City. In 1965, he left The New York Times to write full-time for editor Harold Hayes at Esquire. His 1966 Esquire article on Frank Sinatra, \\"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\\", is one of the most influential American magazine articles of all time, and a pioneering example of New Journalism and creative nonfiction. With what some have called a brilliant structure and pacing, the article focused not just on Sinatra himself, but also on Talese's pursuit of his subject. Talese's celebrated Esquire essay about Joe DiMaggio, \\"The Silent Season of a Hero\\" ‚Äì in part a meditation on the transient nature of fame ‚Äì was also published during 1966. When a number of Esquire essays were collected into a book called Fame and Obscurity, Talese paid tribute in its introduction to two writers he admired by citing \\"an aspiration on my part to somehow bring to reportage the tone that Irwin Shaw and John O'Hara had brought to the short story.\\" Honor Thy Father (1971) was made into a feature movie. During 2008, The Library of America selected Talese's 1970 account of the Charles Manson murders, \\"Charlie Manson's Home on the Range\\", for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime. In 2011, Talese won the Norman Mailer Prize for Distinguished Journalism.  Controversies  In April 2016, Talese spoke at a panel at a Boston University journalism conference. During the panel Talese was asked what nonfiction women writers he found inspiring, to which he responded, \\"I didn't know any women writers that I loved.\\" In response, a Twitter hashtag was \\"immediately\\" created under #womengaytaleseshouldread. In June 2016, the credibility of Talese's book The Voyeur's Motel, whose subject was Gerald Foos, was questioned when it came to light Foos had made false statements to Talese which Talese did not verify. When news of the credibility broke, Talese stated, \\"I'm not going to promote this book. How dare I promote it when its credibility is down the toilet?\\" In subsequent interviews and on an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Talese recanted this disavowal, stating that his story was still accurate despite the discrepancies found by the Washington Post. In a November 2017 interview with Vanity Fair at the New York Public Library's Literary Lions Gala, Talese made comments about the sexual assault accusations against Kevin Spacey that had surfaced over the previous weeks. Talese stated, \\"I would like to ask [Spacey] how it feels to lose a lifetime of success and hard work all because of 10 minutes of indiscretion 10 years or more ago. I feel so sad, and I hate that actor [Anthony Rapp] that ruined this guy's career. So, OK, it happened 10 years ago... Jesus, suck it up once in a while! You know something, all of us in this room at one time or another did something we're ashamed of. The Dalai Lama has done something he's ashamed of. The Dalai Lama should confess... put that in your magazine!\\" CNN reported the \\"backlash on social media was almost immediate.\\" Jenavieve Hatch of the Huffington Post called the remarks \\"disrespectful to survivors of sexual trauma.\\" The Daily Beast's Tom Sykes wrote \\"chastising an alleged child sexual harassment victim is a terrible look.\\" The Washington Post called his statements a \\"bizarre, rabid defense of the actor.\\"  Personal life  In 1959, Talese married writer Nan Talese (n√©e Ahearn), a New York editor who manages the Nan A.

Typically, it denotes a city, conurbation or urban zone with multiple administrative districts, but sharing resources like a central business district, labour market and transport network such that it functions as a single unit. In studying human geography, urban and regional planning or the regional dynamics of business it is often worthwhile to have closer regard to dominant travel patterns during the working day (to the extent that these can be estimated and recorded) than to the rather arbitrary boundaries assigned to administrative bodies such as councils, prefectures, or localities defined merely to optimise postal services. Inevitably, city regions change their shapes over time and quite reasonably, politicians seek to redraw administrative boundaries by perceived geographic reality. The extent of a city region is usually proportional to the intensity of activity in and around its central business district, but the spacing of competing centres of population can also be highly influential. It will be appreciated that a city region need not have a symmetrical shape, and that is especially true in coastal or lakeside situations (such as Oslo, Southampton or Chicago). United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the city regional agenda began to be seen as an alternative to the regional assemblies in England that were favoured as a partial answer to the West Lothian question but rejected in a referendum by voters in North East England in November 2004. The concept of city regions and their development features heavily in The Northern Way, a collaborative development plan between the three northernmost English regional development agencies. An embryonic city regional framework exists in the form of the Passenger Transport Executive and the Core Cities Group. The October 2006 Local Government White Paper did not contain firm proposals for city- region-wide authorities however. The New Local Government Network proposed the creation of city regions as part of on-going reform efforts, while a report released by the IPPR's Centre for Cities proposed the creation of four large city-regions based on Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Greater Manchester. The strong economy of Edinburgh and its hinterland (Forth Valley, Fife, West Lothian, Midlothian and East Lothian) means it has been named as one of Europe's fasting growing city-regions. Also in 2006, the OECD published a number of studies on city regions, including an assessment profile of the Newcastle-Gateshead city region and a review of numerous city regions across the world.\\"OECD Territorial Reviews: Competitive Cities in the Global Economy\\", OECD (November 2006). In July 2007, HM Treasury published its Review of sub-national economic development and regeneration, which stated that the government would allow those city regions that wished to work together to form a statutory framework for city regional activity, including powers over transport, skills, planning and economic development.\\"Sub-national economic development and regeneration review\\" , HM Treasury (11 July 2007). Under the government's Transport Innovation Fund, city regions can band together to pilot forms of road pricing, such as the Greater Manchester congestion charge considered by councils in Greater Manchester (but later rejected by referendum). In the April 2009 Budget, the government announced that Greater Manchester and Leeds would be the first two city regions with formal powers.\\"Budget 2009, chapter 4: Supporting Business,\\" p. 71-86. While this was later discontinued as a result of the May 2010 general election, the Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition government did agree to the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in 2011, with all other proposals and the regional development agencies being subsumed into the local enterprise partnerships.  France  Since January 2010 municipalities, departments and cities can combine into a larger body known as a Metropole. The first Metropole in France, Nice-Cote-d'Azur was created in 2011. In 2014 the government of Jean-Marc Ayrault passed a bill that moved away from the voluntary nature and made it mandatory for all Metropolitan areas of over 600,000 inhabitants to become Metropoles as of January 1, 2015. The first 3 mandatory Metropoles are; * Greater Paris * Aix-Marseille-Provence * Lyon Metropoles take over certain determined responsibilities from the State, other sub-national bodies or quasi-public bodies. Once devolved to the Metropole these responsibilities are the sole responsibility of the Metropole. In addition to assuming responsibility for certain policy Metropoles also take over responsibility for tax collection.

He was one of the first people to create polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and, together with Carl Schotten, he discovered the Schotten-Baumann reaction. Life Baumann was born in Cannstatt, which is now part of Stuttgart. After he attended a gymnasium in Stuttgart, he was educated in the pharmacy of his father. During his time in Stuttgart, he attended the lectures of Hermann von Fehling at the University of Stuttgart. To broaden his education, he went to L√ºbeck and Gothenburg to work in pharmacies there. Later, he studied pharmacy at the University of T√ºbingen. He passed his first exam in 1870 and received his PhD in 1872 for work with Felix Hoppe-Seyler. He followed Hoppe-Seyler to the University of Stra√üburg where did his habilitation in 1876. The same year, Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond offered him a position as the Head of the Chemistry Department of the Institute of Physiology in Berlin. In 1882, Baumann became professor of medicine at that institute, and subsequently obtained professor position at the University of Freiburg. In 1895, he took over the management of Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift f√ºr Physiologische Chemie with Albrecht Kossel. From 1883 till his death, Baumann was married to Theresa Kopp, the daughter of chemist Hermann Kopp, and they had five children. He died at the age of 49 due to a heart problem.

P√∂tsch, Annelore Fischer and Wolfgang M√ºller with contributions of Heinz Cassenbaum: Lexikon bedeutender Chemiker, VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1988, p. 31, . He identified the source for aromatic compounds in urine being the aromatic amino acids, such as tyrosine. He influenced the organosulfur chemistry by the synthesis of thioacetals and thioketals. These substances were subsequently used by other scientists, for example for anesthesia. Together with his coworkers, he was able to prove that thyroxine was the active ingredient in the thyroid gland. Schotten-Baumann reaction An example of a Schotten-Baumann reaction. Benzylamine reacts with acetyl chloride under Schotten-Baumann conditions to form N-benzyl acetamide.

He extended the realm northward along the Andes through modern Ecuador,Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, and developed a special fondness for the city of Quito, which he rebuilt with architects from Cuzco. During this time his father Pachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cuzco into the Tahuantinsuyu, the \\"four provinces.\\" Tupac Inca led extensive military conquests to extend the Inca empire across much of Southern America. He became Sapa Inca in his turn upon his father's death in 1471, ruling until his own death in 1493. He conquered Chimor, which occupied the northern coast of what is now Peru, the largest remaining rival to the Incas. He conquered the province of Antis and subdued the Collas. He imposed rules and taxes, creating two Governor Generals, Suyuyoc Apu, one in Xauxa and the other in Tiahuanacu. Tupac Inca Yupanqui created the fortress Saksaywaman on the high plateau above Cuzco, which included store houses for provisions and clothing. Tupac Inca died about 1493 in Chincheros, leaving two legitimate sons, and 90 illegitimate sons and daughters. Chuqui Ocllo, one of the wives of Tupac Yupanqui, convinced him that his son Ccapac Huari would succeed him, however Tupac Inca changed his mind and decided on his son Titu Cusi Hualpa (who would later become emperor Huayna Capac). This provoked anger in Chuqui Ocllo and she poisoned Tupac Inca. They were both killed soon after Tupac Inca's death. The Pacific Expedition =Legend= Topa Inca Yupanqui is also credited with leading a roughly 10-month-long voyage of exploration into the Pacific around 1480, reportedly visiting islands he called Nina Chumpi (\\"fire belt\\") and Hawa Chumpi (\\"outer belt\\", also spelled Avachumpi, Hahua chumpi). The voyage is mentioned in the History of the Incas by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa in 1572.See online version of the book, page 91; in English. Pedro Sarmiento described the expedition as follows: :‚Ä¶there arrived at Tumbez some merchants who had come by sea from the west, navigating in balsas with sails. They gave information of the land whence they came, which consisted of some islands called Avachumbi and Ninachumbi, where there were many people and much gold. Tupac Inca was a man of lofty and ambitious ideas, and was not satisfied with the regions he had already conquered. So he determined to challenge a happy fortune, and see if it would favour him by sea.‚Ä¶ :The Inca, having this certainty, determined to go there. He caused an immense number of balsas to be constructed, in which he embarked more than 20,000 chosen men.‚Ä¶ :Tupac Inca navigated and sailed on until he discovered the islands of Avachumbi and Ninachumbi, and returned, bringing back with him slaves, gold, a chair of brass, and a skin and jaw bone of a horse. These trophies were preserved in the fortress of Cuzco until the Spaniards came. The duration of this expedition undertaken by Tupac Inca was nine months, others say a year, and, as he was so long absent, every one believed he was dead. =Analysis= Many historians are skeptical that the voyage ever took place. Supporters have usually identified the islands with the Gal√°pagos Islands. It has also been suggested that one of the islands was Easter Island, where oral traditions have claimed that a group of long-eared hanau eepe came to the island from an unknown land.The \\"Hanau Eepe\\", their Immigration and Extermination, Rongorongo.

A camelback locomotive (also known as a Mother Hubbard or a center-cab locomotive) is a type of steam locomotive with the driving cab placed in the middle, astride the boiler. Camelbacks were fitted with wide fireboxes which would have severely restricted driver visibility from the normal cab location at the rear. Development The camel and the camelback design were developed separately by two different railroads in different eras. Though the name is often incorrectly used interchangeably, they had little in common other than the placement of the cab. Unlike the later Camelbacks, Camels had cabs that rode atop the boiler. Ross Winans wanted to put as much weight on the driving wheels as possible to increase traction. Camelbacks have a cab that straddles the boiler. While Camelbacks have the same idea of moving the cab forward, they had it for different reasons. Camelbacks were developed to allow for the use of larger fireboxes, such as the Wootten, which would obstruct the engineer's view from a conventionally placed cab. Camelbacks were particularly known for being used on the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Reading Railroad. =Early use= A 4-6-0 camel built by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1869, housed at the Museum of Transportation The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began to look into developing high-powered steam locomotives in the early 1840s, and in 1844‚Äì1847 built a series of locomotives nicknamed \\"muddiggers\\". As with many early B&O; locomotives, a spur gear drive was used to connect the main shaft to the driving wheels. The long 0-8-0 wheelbase pushed this connection to the back of the locomotive and caused the floor of the cab to be lifted up above the whole assembly. A 4-8-0 camel, (probably the very first 4-8-0) Centipede as built in 1855 (below), and as modified for the B&O; Railroad in 1864 (above). Note the sloping firebox. In 1853 Ross Winans, who had designed the \\"muddiggers\\", built the first of a series of 0-8-0 camel locomotives. These had long cabs that ran from the back of the smokebox to the front of the firebox. The firebox itself sloped back on the earliest models. The fireman worked from a large platform on the tender, and in some cases had a chute to allow him to deliver coal to the front of the grate. Also in 1853, Samuel Hayes, the Master of Machinery for the railroad, had built a series of camel 4-6-0 locomotives for passenger service. The layout of the locomotive was roughly the same as for Winans' freight locomotives, except for the addition of the four-wheel leading bogie. Copies and variations on these locomotives were built into the 1870s, with the last retirements coming in the 1890s. These were called the \\"Hayes Ten-Wheelers\\". The B&O; examples burned conventional bituminous coal. The large fireboxes of these locomotives were made obsolete by better boiler design. The B&O; Railroad Museum has recently restored their Camel Locomotive and returned it to display. It now is in its original colors and markings for the first time since it left the Mt. Clare Shops in 1869. The Museum also has a Central of New Jersey Camelback, the No. 592, which was donated to the Museum in the 1950s. =The Wootten firebox = A 4-6-0 camelback built for the Central Railroad of New Jersey by the Baldwin Locomotive Works John E. Wootten developed the Wootten firebox to effectively burn anthracite waste, which was a plentiful, cheap source of fuel. Wootten determined that a large, wide firebox would work best. As the successful trailing truck used to support large fireboxes had not yet been developed, Wootten instead mounted his huge firebox above the locomotive's driving wheels. The problem now arose that with a cab floor at the then standard tender deck height, it would be impossible for the locomotive's engineer to see forwards around the firebox shoulders. Instead, a cab for the engineer was placed above and astride the boiler. The fireman, however, remained at the rear with minimal protection from the elements. This gave rise to the unusual shape of the camelbacks. =First Camelbacks= The first camelback, a 4-6-0 \\"Ten Wheeler\\", was built in early 1877 by the P&R;'s Reading, Pennsylvania shops. It proved a success; the fuel cost saving was about $2,000 a year (approx. $30,000 now). More were built for the Reading and other of the railroads operating in the anthracite regions. Others were constructed with different wheel arrangements. The largest ones had a 0-8-8-0 arrangement and were the only articulated Camelbacks built. =Later Camelbacks= By the 1920s, many Camelback Ten Wheelers with boiler pressure at 200psi were in daily use pulling passenger trains on the Lehigh Valley, the Philadelphia and Reading, and the Central Railroad of New Jersey, particularly the last two. For their relatively small size, they were powerful, quick to accelerate, very stable at speed, and could be operated as fast as 90 miles per hour such as on the Reading's Atlantic City line. Some continued in service into the 1950s.Baltimore and Ohio Museum Website information Safety Concerns Camel inspection locomotive of Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, circa 1900 The Camelback's cab astride the boiler design raised concerns for its crew. The engineer was perched above the side-rods of the locomotive, vulnerable to swinging and flying metal if anything rotating below should break. In addition, the fireman was exposed to the elements at the rear. The Interstate Commerce Commission finally banned further construction of Camelbacks but gave exceptions to allow those under construction to be completed. In 1927, further orders were completely prohibited. The Philadelphia and Reading's crews referred to these locomotives as Mother Hubbards. The B & O crews, who had co- use of the Reading's line from Philadelphia to Bound Brook NJ (the Reading's junction with the Central RR of New Jersey's line to Jersey City across from New York City) called the Camelbacks \\"Snappers\\" in reference to a possible side rod snapping and flailing into the cab.Baltimore and Ohio Museum discussion of their Camelback display locomotive Many Camelbacks were converted into end-cab locomotives. The advent of the mechanical stoker which moved coal from the tender to the locomotive and its associated underfloor machinery placed cab floors and tender decks higher, and from that vantage point the engineer was safe.

Plot The old Amagi tunnel, setting of the opening of the story. \\"The Dancing Girl of Izu\\" tells the story of the interactions between a young male student from Tokyo, and a small group of travelling performers from nearby Oshima island whom he meets while touring the Izu Peninsula. The student sees the group several times and focuses on the beauty of the youngest looking dancer carrying a large drum. He considers how being on the same road as these travelling performers was exciting. Later, he encounters them again at a tea house, but upon hearing that they were leaving for the next town, he struggles with the thought of chasing after them. Upon catching up with the group, he acts inconspicuously as he passes them on the trail. Much to his relief, the only male in the group, Eikichi, suddenly strikes up a conversation with the student, giving him a reason to keep pace with the travellers. During the trip, he takes a liking to the young dancer that he saw earlier, because of her refreshing and na√Øve character. He quickly befriends Eikichi, and follows the group until they arrive at an old inn. However, much to his disappointment, Eikichi insists that he stay at a better inn, because he saw the student as someone of higher status. Later that night, he hears the performers putting on a show at a nearby restaurant, and recognizes the distinct sound of the young dancer‚Äôs drum. He listens intently to the sound of her drum, and convinces himself that after they are finished performing at the party they will come visit him. However, he becomes very restless during the night when they do not meet him until the following morning. Eikichi invites him to a nearby public bath to relax and share stories. To his surprise, when he sees the young women playing in the adjacent river, he realizes that the girl he was developing feelings for was much younger than he had originally perceived. Upon understanding his mistake, he felt the burden of his infatuation disappear and subsequently breaks into a fit of laughter; he spends the rest of the day in really good spirits. The next day, he gets ready to leave with the performers, however he finds out that they plan on staying an extra day and have no problem if he leaves ahead of them. Again, Eikichi saves him from much trouble and suggests that he stay an extra day as well. As a result, he continues to accompany the performers throughout the following days. Furthermore, the student is able to maintain his affection towards the young dancer through acts of friendship. One day, while they are on the road, he overhears the other women talking about him, and he is very relieved to discover that they think he is a nice person. He is dismayed when he eventually has to separate from the group to return home, and after a brief exchange of farewells with the dancer and Eikichi, he becomes very upset with having to part ways with his new friends so soon. With the thought that he will not likely see them again, he solemnly boards a ship heading to Tokyo.

Unlike most other BCDs, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. The core components of this system are: * A harness, which attaches the system to the diver, and may support other accessories. * The backplate, a plate, usually made from metal, which is held against the diver's back by the harness, and to which the diver's primary cylinder or cylinders are attached. * An inflatable buoyancy bladder known as a wing, between the backplate and the cylinder(s), used for adjusting the buoyancy of the diver when in the water. Function The backplate and wing combination is a modular form of scuba harness and back mounted buoyancy compensator used by scuba divers to support the diving cylinder and buoyancy compensator bladder on the diver's back. It also provides attachment points for accessory equipment such as auxiliary scuba sets for decompression or bailout, lights, cutting tool and guideline reel. Configuration =Harness= The basic harness comprises two lengths of 2\\" (50mm) webbing: One is woven through the slots in the backplate to form closed shoulder loops and an open waist strap, with a weightbelt-type lever action buckle for securing the waist strap, The second section of webbing forms a crotch strap, running from the bottom of the backplate, between the diver's legs, and up to the waist strap, which would be passed through a loop at the front end of the crotch strap. This harness is sometimes referred to as a one-piece harness, due to the shoulder and waist straps being made from a single piece of webbing. The harness is usually fitted with stainless steel D-rings secured by stainless steel \\"sliders\\", small slotted plates which hold their position by friction. A loop of elastic cord is normally attached at the same place as the left shoulder D-ring, to secure the wing's inflator hose. This arrangement is extremely rugged, reliable and hard-wearing. This form of harness may be adjusted to fit different builds of diver by shortening the webbing used to tighten the harness, or installing a new longer section of webbing to loosen the harness. Once adjusted, some flexibility is still allowed by positioning the buckle, which can change the effective length of the waist strap depending on where it is secured. The harness webbing can be replaced at home with no special tools when the webbing wears through or is damaged, and other components can be easily replaced. This makes this style of harness very economical over the long term. Harness accessories *D-rings or a functional equivalent are usually fitted to the waistbelt, shoulder straps and crotch strap to secure stage cylinders, additional equipment, and clipping off demand valves, light heads, and submersible pressure gauges which are not currently being used. The number and position of these D-rings can be adjusted by the user, but there are a few positions which have become fairly standard. **Left and right shoulder strap at roughly the height of the collar bone in front. **Left hip just forward of the backplate. **Crotch strap at the back and front. The front one is used for a tow-line when scootering *Weight holders are available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt. *Canister lights can be carried on the waist belt. The standard position is on the right side. *A small diver's knife or cutting tool is commonly carried on the left side alongside the buckle. *Backup lights are generally clipped to the shoulder D-rings and held against the shoulder straps by rubber bands cut from bicycle inner tubes. Other methods are possible, but the inner tubes work and are easily replaced when they wear out. Many variations to this basic harness are used, and these may include: * Differing number or positioning of D-rings. * Shoulder straps that cross behind the diver's neck. * No crotch strap. * An additional chest strap, which crosses the diver's sternum. * For divers who find it difficult to get the harness on or off, a buckle may be fitted to one or both of the shoulder straps. The left shoulder strap is particularly convenient because this is the side where most dry suits have the auto-dump valve, which tends to snag on the harness. * Neoprene padding tubes are used over the shoulder straps by some divers for comfort. Some manufacturers offer alternative harnesses, often marketed as ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù options, which may include the above variations. Omitting the buoyancy bladder reduces the setup to a plain backpack harness if the breathing set needs to be used on land. However, the standard bent sheet-metal backplate is ergonomically unsuited to this function. =Backplate= The backplate is usually made from a single piece of stainless steel or anodised aluminium, bent along four lines to form a channel running vertically down the center. The plate is about 15‚Äù (38 cm) long and 10‚Äù (25 cm) wide. There are two slots near each of the shoulders and hips, where the harness passes through, and another slot at the bottom of the plate where the crotch strap attaches. There is also one or more pairs of holes in the channel to be used for cylinder attachment; the holes of each pair are usually 11‚Äù apart. A variation on this design uses another two parallel bends to form a shallow trough down the back of the central channel, which stabilises a single cylinder strapped to the centreline. Steel backplates are commonly used when the buoyancy of the diver's other equipment (primarily cylinders and exposure protection) would need a weightbelt, as the negative buoyancy of the steel plate can replace some of this weight. Aluminium backplates are commonly used when the diver would not require a weightbelt (such as when wearing heavy steel cylinders) or when the mass of the backplate must be kept low for air travel. Backplates are occasionally made from other materials, including carbon fiber reinforced plastics, titanium, and ABS plastic. Lightweight versions of the backplate are available with inessential areas cut away to reduce the weight. When taken to the extreme, a single cylinder is used as the longitudinal stiffener, and the backplate is reduced to a skeletal frame at the level of the waist belt, which stabilizes the cylinder against rolling on the diver's back.

As with other BCDs, wings have an inflation valve on a corrugated hose, dump valve, and over pressure valve. Wings are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated. Wings are usually designed to be used with either a single diving cylinder or twin cylinders, although some manufacturers make wings that they recommend for both single and twin cylinder diving. Single-cylinder wings are most commonly oval-shaped and are relatively narrow, and twin-cylinder wings are more likely to be U-shaped and are wider. Some wings, known as bungee wings, incorporate elastic to constrain the wing when it is less than completely full and accelerate air dumping. These wings usually have elastic bands or cords wrapping the bladder area, but some designs use an elasticised shell or cords along a bellows fold gusset. Arguments for and against are: *For: **That constricting the wing improves streamlining and ease of gas dumping. *Against: **That the bungee will increase streamlining only if the wing is inappropriately large. **That the bungee would forcefully expel gas from the wing if there is a small puncture. **That the bungee creates a rough surface, increasing drag; however, in reality it is extremely unlikely that any increase in drag would be significant. **That drag is a minor concern, but entanglement is a real hazard; for this reason, many technical and cave divers use \\"bungee-less\\" wings, as the elastic cords increase the risk of snagging. **That the creases caused by the cords make it more difficult to dump the last of the air, and this may encourage divers to carry more weight than is strictly necessary, thus making good trim more difficult. Some manufacturers, such as OMS and Dive Rite make both and let the purchaser choose which style they prefer. The style which uses elastic only on the side gussets is more streamlined and smoother than the full wrap bungee style. Another variety, the dual bladder wing, contains a second, redundant bladder and inflation assembly, with the second bladder being intended for use if the primary bladder fails, either through a puncture, or through an inflation valve failing. Some technical divers may choose a dual bladder wing to have backup redundancy if the primary bladder fails. Detractors of this arrangement point out that if the extra bladder is inadvertently inflated, the diver may not realise that this has occurred, and it may result in an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This risk may be reduced by having only oral inflation for the backup wing, or requiring the same inflator hose to be used for both wings, and having the backup bladder inflation on the opposite side to the primary bladder. The wing may be a single or double skin unit. A single skin wing uses the same material for structure and holding the air, while a double skin arrangement uses an airtight bladder in a structural casing of strong but porous textile. Single skin construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than double skin wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a double skin wing, while repair of the single skin bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details. Single skin wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth. Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.

File:Travel dive harness P6045465.JPGBellows fold - deflated File:Travel dive harness P6045467.JPGBellows fold - fully inflated =Cylinder attachment= When a backplate is used with a single cylinder, a single tank adapter, or STA, is usually used. The STA is a small metal structure that bolts onto the backplate on the outside of the wings, contains two camstraps, and accommodates the cylinder. Use of a single tank adaptor slightly increases the profile height of the assembly and may affect the centre of gravity which may affect trim. In some cases the increase in height may be undesirable. In some instances, the STA may be omitted, and the camstraps threaded through the wing and backplate. In these cases, the wing will contain a built-in STA in the form of two rods or pads which stabilise the cylinder, or the backplate may be made with a slight channel in the central ridge to hold the single cylinder. Twin cylinders are usually attached to the backplate via bolts, passing through the cylinder bands, and secured by nuts in the central channel of the backplate. An alternative is to use two sets of camstraps and extra slots in the backplate and wing. This arrangement will allow convenient attachment of independent cylinders of almost any size without use of cylinder bands. Some rebreather divers fit backplates to their rebreathers. The exact method of attachment varies between users and rebreather models, and may include modification to the rebreather or using a customised backplate. Some rebreathers are designed specifically for use with backplates. File:Travel diving harness P6045446.JPGLightweight travel diving harness - back view, showing camstraps =Ancillary equipment= The backplate and wing is a minimalistic system, however it does facilitate addition of other equipment. Ancillary equipment, commonly attached to the backplate and wing includes: * Stage or decompression cylinders. * \\"Tow behind\\" diver propulsion vehicles, which use a tow-cord, attaching to the crotch strap D-ring of the harness. * Pockets. * Cutting tool sheath. * Lights/torches, and light/torch battery canisters. Much of this equipment is difficult or impossible to attach to other styles of BCD. Images File:Decompression Dive- Preparation.JPGTechnical divers preparing for a mixed-gas decompression dive.

File:Plongee-StabilisateurDorsal 20040225 PlaqueLacasseSansLegende.jpgHomemade backplate with wings Comparison with alternative equipment The predominant type of BCD currently used in recreational diving is the jacket style BCD. The backplate and wing differs from the jacket style primarily in the way that the functions required of a BCD (attachment to diver, buoyancy control and attachment to cylinder(s)) are performed by distinct components, rather than a single unit. The most significant effects of this division are shifting the buoyancy bladder from the diver's chest to their back and the modularity of the system, allowing buoyancy cells, harnesses, and plates to be interchanged as needed. The buoyancy of a backplate is often significantly negative, especially when the plate is made from stainless steel, and so can replace some of the weight that would otherwise be worn on a weightbelt. Ancillary features that would often be present in jacket BCDs, such as pockets or weight integration, are not found in the core system of a backplate and wing, but can be added as additional components if desired. Other types of BCD exist which more resemble backplate and wing BCD. Back-inflation BCDs are similar in construction to jacket BCDs, except for where the buoyancy cell is. In a back-inflation BCD, as with a backplate and wing, the cell is behind the diver's back, and is of similar shape to a wing, but a back-inflation BCD usually does not have the modularity of a backplate and wing, although some models let buoyancy cells be substituted. Softpack BCDs are another style closer still to backplate and wing BCDs. Softpacks, like backplates, are designed to be modular, and are often marketed towards technical divers. A softpack consists of a padded semi- rigid section that serves that same purpose as a backplate, and uses a harness that is either replaceable, like a backplate harness, or permanently fixed. Softpacks may be used with the same models of wings that are used with backplates. The primary differences between these and backplates are the lack of a rigid plate and possible non-separability of the softpack and harness. The relatively low density of the softpack usually necessitates more ballast weight. A minimalist form of softpack harness is a set of webbing straps much like that of the backplate, but with a webbing strap instead of the plate. This strap may be formed by stitching or threading through sliders a double layer of webbing with slots between the layers which the cambands pass through, and the wing is sandwiched between harness and cylinder. There is no need for a plate, as the cylinder forms the rigid part of the assembly. This arrangement is best suited to single cylinders, and can be made very compact and light for travelling. In some cases a stabiliser plate may be included at the base of the vertical strap, and the harness shoulder and waistband straps thread through this as is done on the standard backplate. History Early scuba sets were simply a set of harness straps connected to a cylinder or manifolded group of cylinders, with a regulator connected to the cylinder valve. This works quite satisfactorily for twin and triple sets, which are inherently quite stable on the back, and have little tendency to roll from side to side. A simple backplate solved the rolling problem, and was often developed into a more ergonomically formed metal, fibreglass, or later, blow- moulded plastic backplate. These usually used simple webbing harness, and were cheap, reliable, and easily repaired. They were usually dedicated to the cylinder, but later versions allowed quick release and attachment of other cylinders. As stabilisor jacket buoyancy compensators became popular, the harness system was integrated with the jacket structure, to simplify the structure and make it easier to use and more comfortable. Eventually most harness systems became more complex and less easy to repair by the user. They also became more bulky over the chest area than the original simple harness systems. Cave divers found that the bulkiness of the stabilisor jackets over the front and sides of the torso got in the way of suspending additional cylinders at their sides for bailout and decompression gases. Safety It is possible for the cylinder or cylinders to become loose from the backplate if the securing nuts are insufficiently tightened and one works loose during the dive. This can lead to the wing moving from the balanced central position to an offset to one side, as it is held in place against the backplate by the cylinder. This can cause buoyancy and trim problems.

After spending his college years at Chattahoochee Valley Community College and Auburn University, Hudson played in the major leagues for the Oakland Athletics (1999‚Äì2004), the Atlanta Braves (2005‚Äì13) and the San Francisco Giants (2014‚Äì15). With the Giants, he won the 2014 World Series over the Kansas City Royals. During his 17-season career, Hudson established himself as one of baseball's most consistent pitchers and until 2014 had never had a season where he suffered more losses than wins. Hudson was also named an All-Star four times: twice with Oakland, once with Atlanta, and once with San Francisco. Before retiring in 2015, Hudson was the winningest active Major League pitcher, as well as one of four active pitchers with at least 200 career wins. With a win against the Oakland A's on July 26, 2015, he has won a game against every team in the majors, the 15th pitcher to do so.Chad Thornburg, \\"Hudson joins small club with win over A's\\". MLB.com, retrieved July 27, 2015. Hudson is one of twenty-one pitchers in Major League history to win at least 200 games, strike out at least 2,000 batters and have a winning percentage above .600. Of those twenty-one, fourteen are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. High school Hudson attended Glenwood School in Phenix City, Alabama where in his senior season he led the team to the 1993 AISA state championship. He finished his high school career with a 12‚Äì1 record and a 1.78 ERA. Despite his record, Hudson was considered undersized by scouts at 6'0\\" tall and 160 pounds and was not drafted nor was he offered a scholarship to a major college. Hudson decided to attend a local two-year college, Chattahoochee Valley Community College (CVCC). College In , his freshman year at CVCC, he earned First-team All American honors while leading his team to the AJCCC Division II championship. He also led CVCC team in batting average (.385), home runs (9), RBI (42), wins (10‚Äì2), strikeouts (76), and was second on the team with a 2.76 ERA. As a sophomore, he was named Second-team All American and set a school and conference record with 117 strikeouts which also led the nation. As a hitter, Hudson batted .345 with 5 home runs, and 29 RBI. His sophomore season ERA of 1.95 was the team and conference best. Prior to his junior year, Hudson transferred to Auburn University where he would play two seasons. He is still at or near the top of many school records. In , he played all 65 games for the Tigers while both pitching and playing outfield. That season, he hit .396 with 18 home runs and 95 RBI. As a pitcher, he finished 15‚Äì2 with a 2.97 ERA to earn SEC Player of the Year and consensus All-American honors. Tim was the first player to be named First Team All-SEC at two positions (P,OF) in the same year. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 6th round of the 1997 amateur draft. Professional career Oakland Athletics in 2004 spring training =Oakland Athletics (1999‚Äì2004)= Hudson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics twice, in the 35th round of the 1994 MLB Draft and again in the 6th round of the 1997 MLB draft, signing in 1997. He made his Major League debut with a five inning start on June 8, 1999 against the San Diego Padres, where he allowed three earned runs in a game the Athletics eventually lost 5‚Äì3. He recorded his first career win in his next start, on June 13 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He allowed only one run in seven innings of the 9‚Äì3 victory. In his rookie season, Hudson had an 11‚Äì2 mark and finished 5th in the AL Rookie of the Year vote. He became a member of Oakland's so-called \\"Big Three\\", along with left-handed pitchers Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. In 2000, he posted a career-high 20 victories along with a 4.14 ERA for Oakland. Over the course of the next three seasons, Hudson's records were 18-9 in 2001, 15‚Äì9 in 2002 and 16‚Äì7 in 2003 with a career low 2.70 ERA. In 2004, Hudson failed to pitch 30 games due to injury. He went 12‚Äì6 in 27 starts. Hudson's record while with the A's was 92 wins, 39 losses, and an ERA of 3.30. =Atlanta Braves (2005‚Äì13)= Before the season, Hudson was traded to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Charles Thomas, Dan Meyer, and Juan Cruz. On August 6, 2005, Hudson won his 100th career game, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 8‚Äì1. In January , Hudson was named to the Team USA roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. His second season with the Braves was disappointing. He posted career-highs in losses (12) and ERA (4.86) in 2006. He returned to his earlier form in however, finishing with a 16‚Äì10 record and a 3.33 ERA. He was in the midst of a 9-game winning streak, the second of his career, at one point in the season. Hudson struck out a career-high 13 batters on April 25 against the Florida Marlins. Hudson is one of only 7 ballplayers who pitched in the NL in 2007 who won at least 12 games in each year from 2004‚Äì07, the others being Carlos Zambrano, Greg Maddux, Roy Oswalt, Jason Marquis, Derek Lowe, and Jeff Suppan. On August 2, 2008, Hudson revealed that he would undergo Tommy John ligament transplant surgery on his pitching elbow, and missed the remainder of the 2008 season. He started the season on the 60-day DL, and did not play prior to the All Star break. On July 2, 2009, he threw a 90-pitch bullpen session and Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox said: \\"He's ready to go. ... He's really come along. He's got major-league stuff right now, his normal stuff.\\" But Cox added that the Braves would not rush the timetable on Hudson's return, which was scheduled for mid- to late-August. Hudson's first minor-league rehab start was tentatively scheduled for July 19 at Class A Myrtle Beach. After completing several minor league rehab sessions, Hudson returned to the Atlanta Braves starting pitching rotation on September 1, 2009. He gave up only two runs and earned his first win of the 2009 season. On November 12, 2009, Hudson signed a $28 million, three-year extension with the Braves with a $9 million option for a fourth year. On August 28, 2010 against the Florida Marlins, Hudson set a career high in strikeouts with 13. On October 5, 2010, Hudson was awarded the 2010 NL Comeback Player of the Year award. On June 20, 2011, in Atlanta, Hudson hit his second career home run, a two-run home run which provided the only scoring of the game in a 2‚Äì0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. On the same day, he got his 1,600th strikeout in the top of the fifth inning against J. P. Arencibia. On July 15, 2011, Hudson was the winning pitcher in the Braves' 10,000th win in franchise history.Braves' 10,000th win is a 10-run rout Hudson went 16‚Äì7 with a 3.62 ERA in 2012. On October 30, 2012, Hudson had his $9 million option exercised by the Braves. On April 30, 2013, Hudson became the 113th major league pitcher to reach 200 wins, with an 8-1 victory over the Washington Nationals at Turner Field. Hudson went 7 innings, giving up only 3 hits and 1 run while recording 6 strikeouts and 2 walks. Hudson also went 2 for 3 at the plate with a double and a home run. On July 24, 2013, Hudson was pitching a 4-hit shutout against the New York Mets when Eric Young, Jr., who was trying to beat a throw to first base, accidentally stepped on Hudson's leg above the ankle. This resulted in an ankle fracture that ended Hudson's 2013 season.Braves‚Äô Hudson breaks ankle in win against Mets After the season, Hudson became a free agent. His record with the Braves was 113‚Äì72 with an ERA of 3.56. =San Francisco Giants (2014‚Äì2015)= Hudson with the San Francisco Giants On November 18, 2013, Hudson agreed to a two-year, $23 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. Hudson set a franchise record by pitching 30 2/3 innings in the season before issuing a walk. The streak was snapped on April 25 when he walked Carlos Santana. In his first year with the Giants, he was selected to participate in the All-Star Game. Accomplishing this feat, he has made the All-Star team at least once with every team he has pitched for. On August 27, 2014 in a 4‚Äì2 team win over the Colorado Rockies at Oracle Park (then called AT&T; Park), Hudson recorded his 2,000th career strikeout. Hudson started game 2 of the 2014 NLDS, a game that went 18 innings; Hudson also started the only other postseason game to go longer than 16 innings while on the Braves in 2005. On October 29, Hudson became the oldest pitcher to start Game 7 of the World Series. The Giants went on to win the game, 3‚Äì2, and the series, 4‚Äì3, over the Kansas City Royals, giving Hudson the first and only World Series ring of his 16-year career. When Hudson started Game 3 in San Francisco, he became the oldest pitcher (age 39) to make a World Series debut. Prior to the 2015 season, Hudson stated it would likely be his last. Following a 4-3 win against the Oakland Athletics on July 26, 2015, Hudson became the 15th pitcher in MLB history to register at least one win against all 30 current teams. On September 26, 2015, Hudson started against Zito and the Athletics in a matchup that was arranged as a tribute to the A's \\"Big Three\\" of the early 2000s. Both pitchers received lengthy standing ovations from the sold-out Oakland Coliseum crowd (which included the third Big Three member, Mulder) upon leaving the game. Scouting report Hudson was a sinkerballer, using that pitch about half the time and at a speed of 87-91 mph. His next-most used pitch was a cutter at 84‚Äì87. He expanded his repertoire to left-handers with a curveball (75-77) and splitter (78-81). He also had a four-seam fastball (88-91 mph). His favored pitch with two strikes to right-handed hitters was his cutter, while he stayed with the sinker to lefties.

The site has yielded some of the most well-known hominin fossils, including \\"Lucy.\\" According to Jon Kalb, early maps show caravan routes passing within 10 or 15 kilometers of Hadar, though not through it. The British explorer L.M. Nesbitt passed 15 kilometers west of Hadar in 1928. Paleontology \\"Lucy,\\" one of the most famous hominin fossils, is a 3.2 million year old Australopithecus afarensis fossil discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia by Donald Johanson in 1974. The first paleo-geological explorations of the Hadar area were conducted by Maurice Taieb. He found Hadar in December 1970 by following the Ledi River, which originates in the highlands north of Bati to empty into the Awash River. Taieb recovered a number of fossils in the area, and led a party back to Hadar in May 1972. In October 1973, 16 individuals with the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) arrived at Hadar and camped there for two months, during which time the first hominin fossil was found. (Taieb claims in his 1985 book Sur la terre des premiers hommes to have discovered the Hadar fields in 1968, but Kalb argues that this claim of an earlier find is incorrect.) The IARE party examined a series of sedimentary layers called the Hadar Formation, which was dated to the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene epochs (3.5 to 2.3 million years ago). Anthropologist Donald Johanson, a member of the 1973 expedition to Hadar, returned the next year and discovered the fossil hominin \\"Lucy\\" in late fall of 1974. He spotted a right proximal ulna in a gully, followed by an occipital bone, a femur, some ribs, a pelvis, and a lower jaw. Within two weeks, nearly 40% of the hominoid skeleton was identified and cataloged. Lucy is the most famous fossil to have been found at Hadar. Lucy is among the oldest hominin fossils ever discovered and was later given the taxonomic classification Australopithecus afarensis. (The name 'Lucy' was inspired by the song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", by The Beatles, which happened to be playing on the radio at base camp.) In 1975, Johanson made another discovery at a nearby site in Hadar: 216 specimens from approximately 17 individuals, most likely related and varying in age, called AL 333 (colloquially referred to as the \\"First Family\\"). About thirty years later in nearby Dikika, another Australopithecus afarensis fossil skeleton was found in a separate outcrop of the Hadar Formation across the Awash River from Hadar. The skeleton is of a three-year-old girl later named \\"Selam,\\" which means peace in Amharic Ethiopian languages.

August 27, 2007. Biography =Early years= Seidensticker was born in 1921 on an isolated farmstead near Castle Rock, Colorado. His father, also named Edward G. Seidensticker, was the owner of a modest ranch that struggled financially during the 1920s and early 1930s. His mother, Mary E. Seidensticker (n√©e Dillon), was a homemaker. Seidensticker was raised Catholic and was of German, English and Irish heritage. By high school, cognizant that he was neither athletic nor mechanically adept, he began to slip away during spare time to read Dickens and Thackeray, among others. He found Tolstoy most to his liking, the works of Mark Twain the least. He was one of the only two students in his graduating class at Douglas County High School to go off to college, the other being his older brother, William.Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 3‚Äì12 Seidensticker wanted to attend an East Coast university, but because of his family's financial situation he grudgingly enrolled in the University of Colorado at Boulder. It was assumed that he would study law, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and several uncles, but he chose economics, then switched to English, a choice that displeased his family. In June 1942, he graduated with a degree in English. =U.S. Navy Japanese Language School= As the 1940s unfolded, the U.S. Navy began to expand its Japanese Language School, then located at the University of California at Berkeley. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, an invitation was issued to shift the school to the University of Colorado. The navy was amenable because the forced relocation of citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry was underway along the West Coast, and most of the program's instructors were in danger of being caught up in the expanding net. By the middle of 1942, the school had completed its move to Colorado. Among those who came east to Boulder with the program was student Donald Keene. Seidensticker, who had been seeking a way to manage through the war without being drafted, saw the Japanese Language School as a solution. He traveled to Washington, D.C. for a school-admittance interview, the first time he had been east of the Chicago, and was accepted. Upon completion of the 14-month intensive program, he was able to read a Japanese language newspaper, albeit with some difficulty. The \\"Boulder Boys,\\" whom the men who attended the language school were fondly called (a handful of women later joined the program as well),Watanabe, Teresa. \\"Godfathers of Japan Studies Take a Look Back\\" Los Angeles Times, April 9, 2000. were given the choice of becoming officers in the Navy or Marine Corps. Seidensticker selected the Marines due to an abundance of \\"boyish romanticism.\\"Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 24 =War years= Seidensticker received basic training with the Marines in North Carolina, after which he was shifted to Camp Pendleton on the West Coast. It was in California that he first encountered Japanese prisoners of war, with whom he was to practice his Japanese. Late in 1944 he and his language-officer colleagues were transferred to the Hawaiian Islands and Pearl Harbor. They were given duties to translate captured documents and to interrogate prisoners of war, a task Seidensticker found increasingly distasteful. In February 1945, Seidensticker was boarded on a ship bound for Iwo Jima. He was not among the first waves of troops to land during the battle, but before long, found himself on the beach \\"loaded down with dictionaries.\\"Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 31 By then the gunfire had ceased as the Japanese had retreated north to bunkers and caves. Later, he reminisced in his memoirs that while he may have been in danger a few times, he had little awareness of being afraid. Near the end of his deployment, after the island had been declared \\"secure,\\" he climbed Mount Suribachi, the site of Joe Rosenthal's iconic flag-raising photograph. He was then rotated back to Hawaii. During that stay, the Atomic Bombs were dropped and the war with Japan came to an end. Although Seidensticker was deeply unsettled by the dropping of the bomb, he approved of Truman's decision. In his memoirs, he noted, \\"Had I been at Harry's Desk, I would have made the decision he made. The important things were to get the war over and to save lives; and that more lives, American and Japanese, were saved by the bombing than were destroyed by it seems the next thing to certain.\\"Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 34 =Occupation of Japan and foreign service= About a month after General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Tokyo to assume control of Japan, Seidensticker landed with the Marines at Sasebo, a naval base city in Nagasaki Prefecture. He was assigned duties disarming Japanese forces and disabling heavy weapons on the islands of Tsushima and Goto. It was during his few months at Sasebo that Seidensticker began to develop a deeper appreciation of Japan and the Japanese people.Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 38‚Äì39 In early 1946 he was sent to San Diego and discharged. On his return to the United States, Seidensticker enrolled at Columbia University and took a master's degree in 1947 in what was then known as \\"public law and government.\\" He joined the U.S. Foreign Service and, after further studies during a summer at Yale University and a year at Harvard, was placed in Tokyo assigned to the Diplomatic Section of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP). In May 1950, roughly two years after he arrived in Japan, Seidensticker decided the Foreign Service was not his calling and he resigned on his own initiative. He had not been promoted while colleagues had, and had deemed himself not the salaryman type. Moreover, he sensed a \\"witch-hunting\\" in which bachelors were subjected to \\"peculiar rumors\\" and a skeptical eye. He also suspected his room at the Daiichi Hotel, his billet, was bugged.Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 57 =Scholar, educator, and latter years= After his short Foreign Service tenure, Seidensticker studied Japanese literature at the University of Tokyo on the GI Bill and later under a Ford Foundation grant. With the Ford fellowship, Seidensticker switched his focus from studying Heian literature to that of modern Japanese literature. In his remaining years at Tokyo University he read virtually the entire canon of modern Japanese literature.Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 72 By the mid-1950s, having exhausted the fellowship circuit, he found work as a lecturer of both American and Japanese literature at Sophia University. While Seidensticker enjoyed his time at Sophia, at the time it did not pay well and he took on a free-lance writing assignments and other part- time jobs. In 1954 he was contacted by Harold Strauss, the chief editor at the New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf about translating Japanese literature for Knopf, and was soon at work. As the 1960s began to unfold, Seidensticker, growing weary of life in Japan and living life as an outsider,Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 108 began to consider returning to the United States. In 1962, when an invitation was extended by Stanford University to substitute for a professor on special assignment, he readily accepted and returned to the U.S. after having lived full-time in Japan from 1948 to 1962. Seidensticker taught at Stanford as professor of Japanese from 1962 to 1966. He then joined the faculty at the University of Michigan and remained there for 11 years before being drawn away in 1978 to join the faculty of Columbia University as professor of Japanese. He retired from Columbia in 1985 and was thereafter professor emeritus. During retirement he divided his time between Hawaii and Japan. In 2007, while taking a walk near Shinobazu Pond in the Ueno district of Tokyo, he fell and later died because of head injuries. He was 86. Translator Seidensticker is widely regarded as one of the greatest translators of classic and modern Japanese literature into English.Fallows, James. \\"Edward Seidensticker\\" The Atlantic, September 3, 2007 His translations have been described as \\"brilliant\\"Gibney, Frank B. \\"A World Where Suffering is Unavoidable and Pleasure a Delusion\\" New York Times, December 19, 1976. and \\"elegant.\\" One contemporary scholar noted that in Seidensticker's translations, \\"You could feel the emotions and nuances that the original writer wanted to convey.\\"Associated Press. \\"Prolific Translator Seidensticker, 86\\" Denver Post, August 27, 2007. He has even been described as \\"the best\\" translator of Japanese literature.Bowers, Faubion. \\"Twenty-five Years Ago: How Japan Won the War\\" The New York Times Magazine, August 30, 1970, p. 6 Seidensticker won the National Book Award in category Translation for his edition of Kawabata's The Sound of the Mountain (a split award). \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1971\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-11. There was a \\"Translation\\" award from 1967 to 1983. He also translated The Decay of the Angel, the last volume of Yukio Mishima's Sea of Fertility tetralogy, and several of Mishima's stories. Seidensticker translated Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki's The Makioka Sisters and Some Prefer Nettles and authored important criticism on Tanizaki's place in 20th-century Japanese literature. The New York Times obituary allowed the translator to speak for himself: The last work he supervised translating into English was You Were Born for a Reason on Japanese Buddhism.Seidensticker's last work, supervising translation of a book Japanologist Seidensticker wrote widely on Japan, its people, as well as the city of Tokyo. His first major non-translation work, \\"Kaf≈´ the Scribbler: The Life and Writings of Nagai Kaf≈´, 1879‚Äì1959\\" (Stanford University Press, 1965), was a biography of Kaf≈´ Nagai, the Japanese writer who is noted for his sensitive depictions of the denizens of Tokyo's pleasure quarters. It was the first study to examine the life and works of Nagai to appear in any Western language. As the book includes a number of Seidensticker translations of Nagai's short stories and novellas, it is neither pure biography nor criticism. Seidensticker, to his lifelong regret, never met Kaf≈´, even though there were opportunities to be introduced.Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Central: A Memoir (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002), p. 142 In Low City, High City: Tokyo from Edo to the Earthquake (1983) and Tokyo Rising: The City Since the Great Earthquake (1990), Seidensticker's two-volume history of Tokyo, he weaves a tale of cultural history of how the city was impacted by the advent of Westernization, and how it responded to the twin disasters of the 20th Century‚Äîthe Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and the massive destruction incurred in World War II due to Allied bombing raids. He published his autobiographical observations in Tokyo Central: A Memoir in 2001. A biography and bibliography are included in a commemorative work created by those whose lives he affected, New Leaves: Studies and Translations of Japanese Literature in Honor of Edward Seidensticker (1993). After retirement, he divided his time between Honolulu and Tokyo.

The Court heard the appeal in June 1984 and gave its ruling a year later, on June 13, 1985. Four questions were asked: # Are sections 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, requiring laws be in both French and English, mandatory in Manitoba, Quebec, and Parliament? # If so, are those Manitoban laws not printed in both languages invalid under section 23 of the Manitoba Act? # If so, do the laws have any force and effect, and if so to what extent? # Are any of the provisions of An Act Respecting the Operation of Section 23 of the Manitoba Act in Regard to Statutes inconsistent with section 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, and if so are the provisions invalid and of no legal force and effect? The Court found that the Constitution Act, 1867, and the Manitoba Act, 1870, did require both languages and that those laws that were not in both languages were of no force and effect. However, they were deemed temporarily valid for a time until translations could be re-enacted in order to avoid a legal vacuum in Manitoba and to ensure the continuity of the rule of law.

Alberta, concerning the inclusion of sexual orientation as a protected human right in Canada. Early life Delwin Vriend, born in Sioux Center, Iowa, in 1966 to a Canadian father and American mother, moved to Edmonton, Alberta, with his parents at the age of two. The oldest of five children, he was raised with three siblings on an organic vegetable farm to the south of Edmonton in Leduc County. His parents were members of the local Christian Reformed Church and he attended private Christian elementary and secondary schools before enrolling at The King's College (now The King's University) in Edmonton and then transferring to Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to earn his physics and mathematics degree. After briefly being employed as an electrician, Vriend was asked to work at The King's College as a laboratory coordinator and chemistry lab instructor. He worked in that capacity for three years. Civil rights case In 1991, Vriend, who was open within his congregation about being in a same- sex relationship, was fired because his sexual orientation was deemed incompatible with a newly created statement of religious belief adopted by The King's College. Vriend attempted to file a discrimination complaint with the Alberta Human Rights Commission, but was refused on the grounds that sexual orientation was not protected under the province's human rights code. He subsequently sued the Government of Alberta and its Human Rights Commission. In 1994, an Alberta court ruled that sexual orientation must be treated as a protected class under human rights legislation. The provincial government subsequently appealed and in 1996 the decision was overruled by the Alberta Court of Appeal. This decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Vriend v. Alberta, who finally ruled in 1998 that provincial governments could not exclude protection of individuals from human rights legislation on the basis of sexual orientation. Despite popular misunderstanding, the Vriend case was not against The King's College, and Vriend never pursued a human rights complaint against the institution. The case strictly involved whether claims to the Human Rights Commission on the basis of sexual orientation could be investigated by provincial human rights commissions, and did not set any legal precedent for the resolution of such claims. Canadian human rights legislation does exempt religious institutions in specific cases typically involving the education of minors, and the Supreme Court ruling did not change that. However, some religious groups had lobbied the provincial and federal governments to invoke Canada's notwithstanding clause to overrule the decision. This course of action was never pursued by the Alberta government. The Supreme Court decision in Vriend vs. Alberta was used to argue provincial cases against bans on same-sex marriage throughout Canada. In addition, the decision has had greater ramifications within Canadian law outside of sexual orientation issues. It has shaped legal precedent concerning provincial and federal government relationships as well as labor and other civil rights and constitutional laws. Personal life Delwin Vriend left the church, according to him, due to the actions of The King's College and the Christian Reformed Church. After his termination, Vriend was unemployed for seven months before finding part-time employment with the AIDS Network of Edmonton Society and eventually a full-time position with the University of Alberta library. However, the publicity surrounding the case caused Vriend to leave Canada in 2000. Stemming from his childhood on an organic farm and the concern for the environment instilled by his parents, Delwin Vriend became vegan in 1994. In 2005, Delwin Vriend placed 44th on the list published by Alberta Venture magazine as one of this century's 50 greatest Albertans. In 2011 Delwin Vriend was inducted into the Q Hall of Fame Canada.

The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or Wicca, is one of a number of different Pagan religions, and developed in England during the first half of the 20th century. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the author of Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as Gardnerian Wicca. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a Horned God and a Mother Goddess, the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a Wheel of the Year and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as covens. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, Raymond Buckland (1934-2017), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in Long Island.Hutton 1999 pp. 205-252.Clifton 2006. In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including Dianic Wicca, a tradition founded in the 1970s which was heavily influenced by second wave feminism, rejecting the veneration of the Horned God and emphasizing female-only covens. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions, who used the pseudonym of Starhawk (1951-), later founded her own tradition, Reclaiming Wicca, as well as publishing The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess (1979), through which she helped to spread Wicca throughout the U.S.Hutton 1999. =Adler and her research= In 1976, Adler publicly announced that Viking Press had offered her a book contract to undertake the first wide-ranging study of American Paganism.Lloyd 2012. pp. 235 Synopsis Margot Adler in 2004. Drawing Down the Moon offers a guide to the Pagan movement across the United States. Republication =1986 revision= In 1986, Adler published a revised second edition of Drawing Down the Moon, much expanded with new information. Identifying several new trends that had occurred in American Paganism since 1979, Adler recognized that in the intervening seven years, U.S. Pagans had become increasingly self-aware of Paganism as a movement, something which she attributed to the increasing number of Pagan festivals. One reviewer noted that the alterations made for the 1986 edition \\"often creates a vivid contrast with events and persons first described in 1979.\\"Herndobler 1987. =1996 revision= =2006 revision= The 2006 edition includes a new section on Greencraft (pp. 127‚Äì129), a Wiccan tradition emerging out of an Alexandrian Wicca coven which had been given authority over the Benelux countries, and which features its own rune alphabet and a non-Hebrew form of Kabbalah based on work by Neopagan author R. J. Stewart; it emphasizes the practice of Wicca as a nature religion and as a mystery religion. It also gives a more complete and sympathetic treatment of the Northern European Neopagan revivals grouped under the rubric \\"Heathenism,\\" which she admits to having consciously omitted from the first edition because of discomfort with the more conservative social values of this form of Pagan revival, and because some far-right and even neo-Nazi groups were using it as a front for their activities at the time (pp. 286‚Äì296). And she prefaces her chapter \\"Women, Feminism, and the Craft,\\" which discusses the emergence of feminist forms of Neopaganism, with discussion of how her personal feelings about such groups have changed, but \\"decided to leave the chapter pretty much as is, with a few minor corrections, and address the question of feminist spirituality today at the end.\\" Reception =Academic reviews= Writing in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Mara E. Donaldson of the University of Virginia commented that Adler's book provided an \\"extensive study of paganism\\" that \\"demythologizes\\" the movement \\"without being sentimental or self-righteous.\\" Considering it to be a \\"serious corrective to common misconceptions\\" propagated in the media, Donaldson stated that it was \\"worth reading\\" despite what she herself perceived as \\"neopaganism's weaknesses\\", namely the movement's lack of \\"historical-traditional-cultural memory\\" and a lack of \\"sensitivity to the Western problem of evil\\".Donaldson 1982. In a 1996 paper discussing the various sociological studies that had then been made of Paganism, the sociologist Sarah M. Pike noted that Drawing Down the Moon had gone \\"a long way towards answering the question\\" as to \\"what makes these [Pagan ritual] activities valid and viable to those who engage in them\\". In doing so, Pike believed that Adler's work was an improvement on earlier sociological studies of the movement, namely that of Nachman Ben- Yehuda, which Pike felt had failed to answer this question.Pike 1996. p. 362. Noting Adler's position as a practicing Wiccan, and the impact which this would have on her study, Pike however felt that the book was \\"less defensive and apologetic than sociological studies conducted by many supposedly objective \\"outsiders\\".\\" Summarizing Drawing Down the Moon as being \\"unmatched\\" in its \\"sweeping survey\\" of the Pagan movement, Pike notes that in providing an overview of the subject it failed to focus on \\"detailed examination of specific issues and events.\\"Pike 1996. p. 363. =Other reviews= Writing for The Women's Review of Books, Robin Herndobler praised Adler's \\"clear, graceful prose\\", and the manner in which she had written about Paganism \\"with interest and compassion.\\" Influence =Pagan community= Writing in his later biography of Eddie Buczynski, the Pagan independent scholar Michael G. Lloyd noted that Adler's book was a marked departure from earlier books dealing with Pagan Witchcraft which continued to equate it with either historical Early Modern witchcraft or Satanism. In her 1999 study of American Wiccans, A Community of Witches, the sociologist Helen A. Berger noted that Drawing Down the Moon had been influential in getting many Wiccans to accept the non- existence of a historical Witch-Cult from which their religion descended.Berger 1999. pp. 21-22. Along with Starhawk's Dreaming the Dark (1982), Adler's book politicized practices of Paganism and witchcraft by emphasising their radical and feminist aspects, and as a result drew many radical feminists into their orbit. =Academia= In her sociological study of American Paganism, Loretta Orion, author of Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited (1995), noted that she had \\"benefitted\\" from Adler's study, believing that it contained \\"insightful reflections\\" on those whom it was studying.Orion 1995. p. 7.

It approaches the study of ecology in a way that explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species and the interactions between them. Conversely, it can be seen as an approach to the study of evolution that incorporates an understanding of the interactions between the species under consideration. The main subfields of evolutionary ecology are life history evolution, sociobiology (the evolution of social behavior), the evolution of inter specific relations (cooperation, predator‚Äìprey interactions, parasitism, mutualism) and the evolution of biodiversity and of communities. Evolutionary ecology mostly considers two things: how interactions (both among species and between species and their physical environment) shape species through selection and adaptation, and the consequences of the resulting evolutionary change. Evolutionary models A large part of evolutionary ecology is about utilising models and finding empirical data as proof. Examples include the Lack clutch size model devised by David Lack and his study of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands. Lack's study of Darwin's finches was important in analyzing the role of different ecological factors in speciation. Lack suggested that differences in species were adaptive and produced by natural selection, based on the assertion by G.F. Gause that two species cannot occupy the same niche.\\"Lack, David Lambert.\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 17, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008, pp. 521‚Äì523.

Richard Levins introduced his model of the specialization of species in 1968, which investigated how habitat specialization evolved within heterogeneous environments using the fitness sets an organism or species possesses. This model developed the concept of spatial scales in specific environments, defining fine-grained spatial scales and coarse-grained spatial scales.Brown, Joel S., and Noel B. Pavlovic. ‚ÄúEvolution in heterogeneous environments: Effects of migration on habitat specialization.‚Äù Evolutionary Ecology, vol. 6, no. 5, 1992, pp. 360‚Äì382. . The implications of this model include a rapid increase in environmental ecologists' understanding of how spatial scales impact species diversity in a certain environment.Hart, Simon P., et al. ‚ÄúThe spatial scales of species coexistence.‚Äù Nature Ecology & Evolution, vol. 1, no. 8, 2017, pp. 1066‚Äì1073. Another model is Law and Diekmann's 1996 models on mutualism, which is defined as a relationship between two organisms that benefits both individuals.Bronstein, Judith. ‚ÄúMutualisms and Symbioses.‚Äù Oxford Bibliographies, 20 Nov 2017, www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0006.xml. Law and Diekmann developed a framework called adaptive dynamics, which assumes that changes in plant or animal populations in response to a disturbance or lack thereof occurs at a faster rate than mutations occur. It is aimed to simplify other models addressing the relationships within communities.Ak√ßay, Erol. (2015). Evolutionary models of mutualism. In J. L. Bronstein (Ed.), Mutualism (pp. 57‚Äì76). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.  Tangled nature model  The tangled nature model provides different methods for demonstrating and predicting trends in evolutionary ecology. The model analyzes an individual prone to mutation within a population as well as other factors such as extinction rate. The model was developed by Simon Laird, Daniel Lawson, and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen of the Imperial College London in 2002. The purpose of the model is to create a simple and logical ecological model based on observation. The model is designed such that ecological effects can be accounted for when determining form, and fitness of a population.  Ecological genetics  Ecological genetics tie into evolutionary ecology through the study of how traits evolve in natural populations. Ecologists are concerned with how the environment and timeframe leads to genes becoming dominant. Organisms must continually adapt in order to survive in natural habitats. Genes define which organisms survive and which will die out. When organisms develop different genetic variations, even though they stem from the same species, it is known as polymorphism. Organisms that pass on beneficial genes continue to evolve their species to have an advantage inside of their niche. Evolutionary ecologists Julia Margaret Cameron‚Äôs portrait of Darwin = Charles Darwin = The basis of the central principles of evolutionary ecology can be attributed to Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882), specifically in referencing his theory of natural selection and population dynamics, which discusses how populations of a species change over time. According to Ernst Mayr, professor of Zoology at Harvard University, Darwin‚Äôs most distinct contributions to evolutionary biology and ecology are as follows: ‚ÄúThe first is the non-constancy of species, or the modern conception of evolution itself. The second is the notion of branching evolution, implying the common descent of all species of living things on earth from a single unique origin.‚Äù Additionally, ‚ÄúDarwin further noted that evolution must be gradual, with no major breaks or discontinuities. Finally, he reasoned that the mechanism of evolution was natural selection.‚Äù = George Evelyn Hutchinson = George Evelyn Hutchinson‚Äôs (1903‚Äì1991) contributions to the field of ecology spanned over 60 years, in which he had significant influence in systems ecology, radiation ecology, limnology, and entomology. Described as the ‚Äúfather of modern ecology‚Äù by Stephen Jay Gould, Hutchinson was one of the first scientists to link the subjects of ecology and mathematics. According to Hutchinson, he constructed ‚Äúmathematical models of populations, the changing proportions of individuals of various ages, birthrate, the ecological niche, and population interaction in this technical introduction to population ecology.‚Äù He also had a vast interest in limnology, due to his belief that lakes could be studied as a microcosmthat provides insight into system behavior. Hutchinson is also known for his work Circular Casual Systems in Ecology, in which he states that ‚Äúgroups of organisms may be acted upon by their environment, and they may react upon it. If a set of properties in either system changes in such a way that the action of the first system on the second changes, this may cause changes in properties of the second system which alter the mode of action of the second system on the first.‚Äù = Robert MacArthur = Robert MacArthur (1930‚Äì1972) is best known in the field of Evolutionary Ecology for his work The Theory of Island Biogeography, in which he and his co-author propose ‚Äúthat the number of species on any island reflects a balance between the rate at which new species colonize it and the rate at which populations of established species become extinct.‚Äù = Eric Pianka = According to the University of Texas, Eric Pianka‚Äôs (1939‚Äìpresent) work in evolutionary ecology includes foraging strategies, reproductive tactics, competition and niche theory, community structure and organization, species diversity, and understanding rarity. Pianka is also known for his interest in lizards to study ecological occurrences, as he claimed they were ‚Äúoften abundant, making them relatively easy to locate, observe, and capture.‚Äù = Michael Rosenzweig = Michael L. Rosenzweig (1941‚Äìpresent) created and popularized Reconciliation ecology, which began with his theory that designated nature preserves would not be enough land to conserve the biodiversity of Earth, as humans have used so much land that they have negatively impacted biogeochemical cycles and had other ecological impacts that have negatively affected species compositions. = Other notable evolutionary ecologists = * R.

Research Michael Rosenzweig's idea of reconciliation ecology was developed based on existing research, which was conducted on the principle first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt stating that larger areas of land will have increased species diversity as compared to smaller areas. This research focused on species-area relationships (SPARs) and the different scales on which they exist, ranging from sample-area to interprovincial SPARs. Steady-state dynamics in diversity gave rise to these SPARs, which are now used to measure the reduction of species diversity on Earth. In response to this decline in diversity, Rosenzweig's reconciliation ecology was born.Rosenzweig, Michael L. ‚ÄúReconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity.‚Äù Oryx, vol. 37, no. 02, 10 Feb. 2003, . Evolutionary ecology has been studied using symbiotic relationships between organisms to determine the evolutionary forces by which such relationships develop. In symbiotic relationships, the symbiont must confer some advantage to its host in order to persist and continue to be evolutionarily viable. Research has been conducted using aphids and the symbiotic bacteria with which they coevolve. These bacteria are most frequently conserved from generation to generation, displaying high levels of vertical transmission. Results have shown that these symbiotic bacteria ultimately confer some resistance to parasites to their host aphids, which both increases the fitness of the aphids and lead to symbiont-mediated coevolution between the species.Vorburger, Christoph, et al. ‚ÄúComparing constitutive and induced costs of symbiont- Conferred resistance to parasitoids in aphids.‚Äù Ecology and Evolution, vol. 3, no. 3, 2013, pp. 706‚Äì13. .  Color variation in cichlid fish  The effects of evolutionary ecology and its consequences can be seen in the case of color variation among African cichlid fish. With over 2,000 species, cichlid fishes are very species-rich and capable of complex social interactions. Polychromatism, the variation of color patterns within a population, occurs within cichlid fishes due to environmental adaptations and to increase chances of sexual reproduction.

The original implementation came from 3dfx Interactive, and was designed around supporting Quake. Other companies implementing similar software included PowerVR and Rendition.  History  In 1996, id Software announced that the Rendition V√©rit√© was to be the only hardware 3D accelerator targeted by Quake. Partly because of the perceived hassle in supporting chipset specific APIs and partly because Quake's development heritage on high-end workstations made such a thing easy. They also released a Microsoft Windows port of their OpenGL version of Quake, even though no consumer chipset had OpenGL support at the time. In response, 3dfx developed and quickly released the first MiniGL: a quick implementation of the bare minimum amount of the OpenGL API that was required to run the OpenGL version of Quake. By obtaining a copy of the OpenGL Quake executable and a copy of the relevant MiniGL, 3dfx owners could easily modify their copies of Quake to play with full 3D acceleration, giving a smoother and better looking display than was possible with the Quake software renderer. After the success of the 3dfx original, several other manufacturers followed 3dfx in producing MiniGL drivers. At the time, the OpenGL API was almost universally agreed to be superior to the then new and immature Direct3D system from Microsoft, so following the arrival of the various MiniGLs, many programmers sought to use them in other programs as an easy way of supporting multiple 3D chipsets. Unfortunately, id Software had not released any official list of OpenGL calls and parameters used by Quake and none of the MiniGL implementors had released lists of what their implementation would and would not support. In practice, this led to a very cautious use of OpenGL features by programmers and new releases of MiniGLs with slightly more functionality every time a major game came along that did not work on the previous generation. All major 3D card manufacturers now support complete OpenGL implementations, negating the need for any sort of MiniGL.  Other implementations  MiniGL implementations have been developed for other operating systems, including Palm OS and AmigaOS.

Additionally, the heads of certain colleges in the UK and Ireland are called provosts; it is, in this sense, the equivalent of a master at other colleges. Duties, role, and selection The specific duties and areas of responsibility for a provost vary from one institution to another, but usually include supervision and oversight of curricular, instructional, and research affairs. The various deans of a university's schools, colleges, or faculties generally report to the provost, or jointly to them and the institution's chief executive officer, whether that is called its president, chancellor, or rector. Likewise the heads of various interdisciplinary units and academic support functions, such as libraries, student services, the registrar, admissions, and information technology. The provost, in turn, is responsible to the institution's chief executive officer and governing board or boards (variously called its trustees, the regents, the governors, or the corporation) for oversight of all educational affairs and activities, including research and academic personnel. In many but not all North American institutions, the provost or equivalent is the second-ranking officer in the administrative hierarchy. Often the provost may serve as acting chief executive officer during a vacancy in that office or when the incumbent is absent from campus for prolonged periods. In these institutions, the title of provost is sometimes combined with those of senior vice president, executive vice president, executive vice chancellor, or the like, to denote that officer's high standing. Provosts often receive staff support or delegate line responsibility for certain administrative functions to one or more subordinates variously called assistant provost, associate provost, vice provost, or deputy provost. The deputy provost is often the right-hand person of the provost who assumes the provost's responsibilities in the provost's absence. Provosts are often chosen by a search committee made up of faculty members, and are almost always drawn from the 'tenured faculty' or 'professional administrators' with academic credentials, either at the institution or from other institutions. Titles and other uses At some North American research universities and liberal arts colleges, other titles may be used in place of or in combination with provost, such as chief academic officer (CAO) or vice president for academic affairs (or, rarely, academic vice-president, academic vice rector, or vice president for education). At smaller independent liberal arts colleges, the chief academic officer may carry the title \\"dean of the college\\" or \\"dean of the faculty\\" in addition to or instead of provost. For example, at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, the dean of the faculty is also the vice president for academic affairs and is the second-highest administrator, directly beneath the president. State university systems in the United States are the state universities operated and funded primarily by the state government. (They may include multiple administratively independent campuses, or an integrated multi-campus state university.) In some state university systems, provost may be the title held by the head of a branch campus. For example, until recently the chancellors of the Newark and Camden campuses of Rutgers University in New Jersey were known as provosts. Sometimes the chief academic officer or chief medical officer of a university medical center (also academic medical center) holds the title of provost. In some universities, the chief administrative officer of a large academic division may be a provost. Finally, in some colleges and universities, the title of provost (and the function of deputy to the president or chancellor) may be separate from the function of chief academic officer. Provost is the style of the heads of University College London; the Royal College of Art; Oriel, Queen's and Worcester Colleges at Oxford; King's College at Cambridge; Trinity College at Dublin; and St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews), as well as the deputy head of Imperial College London. The chairman of the governors of Eton College is also called a provost. There are also Provosts for the University of Reading Malaysia Campus. History The title \\"provost\\" (Latin: praepositus) was used in England in medieval times for the head of colleges such as Oriel College, Oxford and Eton College. In the context of local government, the title is even older; see civil provost The first use of the title in American and Canadian higher education is unclear. At the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, the title dates from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, respectively. At Penn, the administrative head of the university was titled provost until the 1930s, when the board of trustees created a separate office of president and re-designated the provost as chief academic officer and subordinate to the new position. At Columbia, the board of trustees established the office of provost in 1811, only to abolish it five years later. The Trustees and the president of the university re-established the office of provost in 1912. Although the precise title of the office has changed over time, its responsibility as Columbia's chief academic officer has remained constant. Other North American universities and colleges created provosts as heads of academic affairs during and after World War II, when dramatic increases in undergraduate enrollments (due to the G.I. Bill) and the increased complexity of higher education administration led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, most of the other Ivy League institutions (Dartmouth, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, and Brown) had provosts (or equivalents), as did other private research universities such as the University of Chicago, Stanford University, Rice University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University, Emory University, Wake Forest University and Duke University. At Harvard University, the office of provost has had two distinct incarnations. The first was during World War II and the immediate postwar era. James Bryant Conant, the president of the university from 1933 to 1953, asked the Harvard Corporation (the more senior of the two governing boards) to create the office of provost in October 1945, at time when he (Conant) spent a great deal of time in Washington, D.C. as chairman of the National Defense Research Committee. A provision was created where the dean of the Faculty of Arts of Sciences (FAS) would concurrently serve as provost. Conant appointed historian Paul Herman Buck, in which capacity he had oversight of FAS (which includes Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Extension School, the Summer School, and what is now called the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) and its affiliated laboratories, research centers, and museums. However, he had no authority over Harvard's professional schools (at that time, the Divinity School, the Law School, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate Schools of Business Administration, Design, Education, and Public Administration). That provost's office was eliminated when Conant retired from Harvard's presidency in 1953. During the presidencies of Nathan Marsh Pusey (1953‚Äì1971) and Derek C. Bok (1971‚Äì1993), the deans of Harvard's nine faculties reported directly to the president, with the dean of FAS being primus inter pares. The second incarnation began in 1993, when then Harvard President Neil Rudenstine asked the corporation to create the provostship as a second university-wide academic officer, reporting to its president. A section of Harvard's 1997 Re-accreditation Report for the New England Commission of Colleges and Schools reads: > The Provost at Harvard acts as an extension of the President. He is the > second academic officer, after the President, having purview of the entire > University. The Provost has special responsibility for fostering > intellectual interactions across the University, including the five > Interfaculty Initiatives (environment, ethics and the professions, schooling > and children, mind/brain/behavior, and health policy).

In his later years, he wrote an account of his service in the Grande Arm√©e, including a detailed account of his participation in the campaign of 1812, Napoleon's Russian campaign against Tsar Alexander I. This, together with Joseph Abbeel's diary, form the only known records of that campaign kept by common soldiers. Early life Jakob Walter was born in the town of Rosenberg in 1788, near Kaiya's land in the German state of W√ºrttemberg, which was part of the short-lived Confederation of the Rhine founded by Napoleon and was considered a French vassal state. By trade, Walter was a stonemason. He was a Roman Catholic and seems to have been intermittently devout; in his book, he condemns the Brandenburgian peasants for not attending Mass, and at one point tells how he destroyed a book he considered heretical; on the other hand, he admits that he deceived a nun by pretending to be a Capuchin monk. First and Second Campaigns In 1806, Walter and his brother were conscripted into the regiment of Romig and served in the campaign of 1806-1807 in Poland, as part of King J√©r√¥me‚Äôs contribution to the Grande Arm√©e. He returned home in 1807 and was recalled for the campaign of 1809 in Austria. After this campaign he returned to civilian life and remained a private citizen through 1810 and 1811. The Russian Campaign In 1812, Walter was recalled once again for the Grande Arm√©e's invasion of Russia. Originally Walter's regiment was under the command of the Crown Prince of W√ºrttemberg, but for the campaign of 1812 it was transferred to the command of Marshal Ney. =March to Moscow= As a common soldier, Walter had a limited view of the scope of the campaigns he was involved in. By far the greater part of his time was spent on the march, and most of his memoir concerns foraging; he speaks of the difficulty of forcing peasants to show where their food was hidden. He describes the extremes of heat and cold (made worse because he abandoned his extra clothing in the hot weather, and then suffered in the cold) and notes that more soldiers died from thirst than anything else, because there was very little good water on the route. At times he survived on dough balls made from looted flour mixed with muddy water and roasted in a fire; for almost a week he lived on a jar of honey he dug up from where a peasant had hidden it. As both a German and a conscript, Walter had no particular loyalty to Napoleon. He rarely mentions him, and when he does he generally refers to him simply as \\"Bonaparte.\\" He had no knowledge of the larger strategy of the campaign; his descriptions of combat are chaotic, as in his description of the assault on the city of Smolensk on August 17, 1812: > So, as soon as day broke --we marched against the city. The river was > crossed below the city. The suburbs on the northern side were stormed, set > on fire, and burned up. My company's doctor, named Sta√ºble, had his arm shot > away in crossing the stream, and he died afterward. No longer could I pay > any attention to my comrades and, therefore, knew not in what way they > perished or were lost. Everyone fired and struck at the enemy in wild > madness, and no one could tell whether he was in front, in the middle, or > behind the center of the army. =Retreat from Moscow= Walter records that after the fall of Moscow and the subsequent retreat, the French commanders became more brutal to the men; he says that even in retreat the commanders would inspect the men's weapons, and men who had rust on their weapons were beaten with clubs \\"until they were near desperation.\\" Also, food became even harder to find, and several times he had to fight French and German soldiers over scavenged wheat. In the bivouac at Smolensk, the men slaughtered their horses, and fought over the meat. Unable to get even horse meat, Walter turned to blood: > ...I took along the pot I carried, stationed myself beside a horse that was > being shot, and caught up the blood....I set this blood on the fire, let it > coagulate, and ate the lumps without salt. Walter was shaken by the efficiency of the Russian scorched earth policy. He recorded that > From Smolensk to Moshaisk the war displayed its horrible work of > destruction: all the roads, fields, and woods lay as though sown with > people, horses, wagons, burned villages and cities; everything looked like > the complete ruin of all that lived. Later life Jakob Walter returned safely to W√ºrttemberg and remained there the rest of his life. He married in 1817 and had ten children, of whom five were still living when he wrote a letter to his son Albert in 1856. In his later years he wrote an account of his experiences, intended for his family. He titled it Denkwurdige Geschichtschreibung √ºber die erlebte Millit√§ridienstzeit des Verfassers dieses Schreibens (\\"Memorable History of the Military Service Experienced by the Author of these Letters.\\") He mailed it to his son Albert, who had emigrated to the United States, in 1856. In 1932, a scholar at the University of Kansas, Frank E. Melvin, acquired the manuscript and authenticated it. Another University of Kansas professor, Otto Springer, translated the work into English, and they published it as A German Conscript with Napoleon. In 1991, Penguin Books re-issued the Springer translation in the United States and Canada under the title The Diary of a Napoleonic Foot Soldier (Penguin Books USA, New York, NY, .)

In the United States, adventure tourism has grown in recent decades as tourists seek out-of-the- ordinary or \\"roads less traveled\\" vacations, but lack of a clear operational definition has hampered measurement of market size and growth. According to the U.S.-based Adventure Travel Trade Association, adventure travel may be any tourist activity that includes physical activity, a cultural exchange, and connection with nature. This wide definition is demonstrated by examples as contrasting as adventure tourism simply being travel to destinations that are ‚Äúless visited‚Äù or involve gentle physical activity https://www.toursmongolia.com/top-5-adventure-tours-mongolia versus very physically or mentally demanding travel. Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states characterized as rush or flow, resulting from stepping outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by performing acts requiring significant effort and involve some degree of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include activities such as mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing. Some obscure forms of adventure travel include disaster and ghetto tourism. Other rising forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism. As a closely related subspecies of adventure travels, event trips involve various kinds of touristic travels that aim at particular activities as an important part of the travel, which don't necessary fulfil the criteria of being proper adventures. Activities comprised under the term \\"event trips\\" range from international sports events (i.e. FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl) to renowned cultural events (i.e. Bayreuth Festival, Venice Film Festival). Access to inexpensive consumer technology, with respect to Global Positioning Systems, flashpacking, social networking and photography, have increased the worldwide interest in adventure travel.The Development of Social Network Analysis Vancouver: Empirical Press. The interest in independent adventure travel has also increased as more specialist travel websites emerge offering previously niche locations and sports.  Types  =Accessible tourism= There is a trend for developing tourism specifically for the disabled. Adventure travel for the disabled has become a US$13 billion a year industry in North America.Stan Hagen ‚Äì Tourism Minister of British Columbia Some adventure travel destinations offer diverse programs and job opportunities developed specifically for the disabled.The Equity: \\"Esprit rafting to be featured in commercial\\", Wednesday, May 14th, 2008, print edition = Extreme tourism = Extreme tourism involves travel to dangerous (extreme) locations or participation in dangerous events or activities. This form of tourism can overlap with extreme sport. = Jungle tourism = Jungle tourism is a subcategory of adventure travel defined by active multifaceted physical means of travel in the jungle regions of the earth. According to the Glossary of Tourism Terms, jungle tours have become a major component of green tourism in tropical destinations and are a relatively recent phenomenon of Western international tourism. = Overland travel = Overland travel or overlanding refers to an \\"overland journey\\" ‚Äì perhaps originating with Marco Polo's first overland expedition in the 13th century from Venice to the Mongolian court of Kublai Khan. Today overlanding is a form of extended adventure holiday, embarking on a long journey, often in a group. Overland companies provide a converted truck or a bus plus a tour leader, and the group travels together overland for a period of weeks or months. Since the 1960s overlanding has been a popular means of travel between destinations across Africa, Europe, Asia (particularly India), the Americas and Australia. The \\"Hippie trail\\" of the 60s and 70s saw thousands of young westerners travelling through the Middle East to India and Nepal. Many of the older traditional routes are still active, along with newer routes like Iceland to South Africa overland and Central Asian post soviet states.

He was also a proponent of dual quaternions, which he termed \\"octonions\\" or \\"Clifford biquaternions\\". McAulay was born on 9 December 1863 and attended Kingswood School in Bath. He proceeded to Caius College, Cambridge, there taking up a study of the quaternion algebra. In 1883 he published an article \\"Some general theorems in quaternion integration\\".A. McAulay (1883) Messenger of Mathematics 13:26 to 37 McAulay took his degree in 1886, and began to reflect on the instruction of students in quaternion theory. In an article \\"Establishment of the fundamental properties of quaternions\\"McAulay (1888) Messenger of Mathematics 18:131 to 136 he suggested improvements to the texts then in use. He also wrote a technical articleA. McAulay (1888) \\"The transformation of multiple surface integrals into multiple line integrals\\", Messenger of Mathematics 18:139 to 45 on integration. Departing for Australia, he lectured at Ormond College, University of Melbourne from 1893 to 1895. As a distant correspondent, he participated in a vigorous debate about the place of quaternions in physics education.M.J. Crowe (1967) A History of Vector Analysis, U. Notre Dame Press. Chapter 6 details McAulay's four contributions in 1893 and 94 to the debate on vectors and quaternions. In 1893 his book Utility of Quaternions in Physics was published. A. S. Hathaway contributed a positive reviewA. S. Hathaway (1894) Review: Utility of Quaternions in Physics, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 3(8):179‚Äì85 and Peter Guthrie Tait praised it in these terms: :Here, at last, we exclaim, is a man who has caught the full spirit of the quaternion system: the real aestus, the awen of the Welsh Bards, the divinus afflatus that transports the poet beyond the limits of sublunary things! Intuitively recognizing its power, he snatches up the magnificent weapon which Hamilton tenders us all, and at once dashes off to the jungle on the quest of big game.PG Tait (1893) Nature 28 December McAulay took up the position of Professor of Physics in Tasmania from 1896 until 1929, at which time his son Alexander Leicester McAulay took over the position for the next thirty years. Following William Kingdon Clifford who had extended quaternions to dual quaternions, McAulay made a special study of this hypercomplex number system. In 1898 McAulay published, through Cambridge University Press, his Octonions: a Development of Clifford's Biquaternions. McAulay died on 6 July 1931. His brother Francis Macaulay, who stayed in England, also contributed to ring theory.

The character was named for United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.. Fictional character biography Oliver is an elementary-school age child with an incredibly advanced knowledge of science, math, technology, and computers. He is a strict rationalist and an atheist, although his understanding of the complex nature of the universe drives him to consider (once per year, on a strict schedule) the possibility of an intelligence behind its creation. His father, Frank Jones, was a regular character in the series, while his mother, while present, appeared far less and usually only in direct reaction to Oliver's storylines. The Jones family represented the only African-American family in the strip, a fact that was often referenced directly as a point of humor or satire. The genius of the group, he frequently use his intelligence for political activism that borders on the illegal, such as hacking and dangerous scientific experiments. His father Frank frequently punishes him for his criminal activities, albeit begrudgingly, particularly when some of Oliver's schemes profit Frank personally. =First appearance= Oliver first appeared in a Bloom County's daily strip on September 26, 1983, dragging a desktop computer in a wagon. Over the course of strips on the following four days, he used his Banana Jr. 6000 computer to alter the front page of the New York Times from \\"Reagan Calls Women 'America's Most Valuable Resource'\\" to \\"Reagan Calls Women 'America's Li'l Dumplin's'\\", sparking nationwide outrage (the comment was based on a real comment made by Hayden Fry, the football coach for the University of Iowa). He similarly hacked into the headquarters of Russia's state-owned newspaper and attempted to change the headlines to \\"Gorbachev Urges Disarmament! Complete! Total!\\" (though due to a mistranslation, the headlines actually read \\"Gorbachev Sings Tractors! Turnips! Buttocks!\\"). He also breached computers at the National Strategic Defense Center (a reference to NORAD), AT&T;'s telephone customer account file, and the IRS in order to give his father a multi-million dollar tax refund. Among his other accomplishments is building an atomic bomb for a school science project using radioactive material scraped from luminescent clocks, a feat that got him suspended from school. He also hijacked HBO's transmissions claiming to be leader of the \\"People's Revolutionary Anti Scrambling Front for the Liberation of Public Airwaves etc, etc.\\" in a stunt reminiscent of Captain Midnight's similar hijacking of HBO. =Parents= Oliver's parents are Frank and Eleanor Jones, named for Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Frank is resigned to having a \\"weird\\" son and often deliberately ignores Oliver's activities because he realizes he would not understand the explanation even if Oliver gave one (Frank has also stated that if he ever did understand the explanation, he would have report his son to the authorities). At times Oliver uses his father as an unwitting guinea pig for his experiments or outright bribes him to look the other way; Frank usually recovers from these misadventures to punish Oliver with a spanking or by temporarily taking away his computer. On the other hand, Eleanor is deeply distressed by her son's behavior, though mostly from the point of view that he should seek out friends or typical hobbies (such as football) rather than lock himself away with his computer and experiments. She also encourages him to look for more mainstream role models, at one point attempting to dress him as Michael Jackson. Oliver takes pains to conceal his exploits from his mother for fear of upsetting her. Frank likewise tries to keep the truth from his wife, though this is often because he himself is complicit in encouraging Oliver's illegal schemes. Inventions =The Electro-Photo Pigment-izer= In an attempt to destroy the South African apartheid regime, Oliver invented a camera whose flash turned the victim's skin color darker, with the intention of using it on the white South African ambassador in order to cause political chaos. The plan was thwarted when Cutter John, who had volunteered to be airdropped into the South African embassy with the use of helium balloons attached to his wheelchair, was blown off course and ended up in Russia. =The Teleportation Device= This was an attempt to transport matter. A few bugs plagued it in the beginning: Oliver's first attempt at teleportation landed him part way in the floor. Another attempt resulted in his father's Jaguar XJS being transported into orbit around Pluto. The largest disaster was due to Bill The Cat's presence in the transporter with Oliver, which changed Oliver into half-human half-cat, a la The Fly. This was later revealed to be a dream. =Scalp Tonic= In the course of attempting to create a deodorant from Bill the Cat's sweat, the resulting solution was discovered to cure baldness, launching a hair-tonic business for the Jones family until the government declared the tonic a controlled substance. Subsequently, the price of the tonic skyrocketed, and the Bloom County gang soon found themselves running a lucrative underground hair-tonic cartel, only to have it collapse when the government later decriminalized the tonic. =The Grand Unification Theory= Oliver began an escalating rivalry with Stephen Hawking after learning that they were both seeking an equation that explained the universe. Oliver wrote a letter to Hawking, ridiculing his mathematical abilities; Hawking responded by mailing Oliver a thermonuclear bomb. Oliver eventually beat Hawking to the equation and attempted to explain it to Opus. Under closer examination, the equation disproved the existence of flightless waterfowl, inadvertently erasing Opus from existence. Checking his sums, Oliver discovers that he \\"forgot to carry the two\\" and corrected the equation, which restored Opus but rendered the equation useless.

It was founded in 1993 by a coalition of African- American artists and writers, consisting of Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek T. Dingle. The founders believed that minorities were severely underrepresented in American comics, and wished to address this. History =Development= Christopher Priest participated in the early planning stages of Milestone Media, and was originally slated to become the editor-in-chief of the new company, but left the endeavor for personal reasons before any of Milestone's titles were published.Priest, Christopher (September 2000). \\"CHAPTER FOUR: Milestone: Finally I Was There\\". \\"Adventures in the Funnybook Game\\". Official Website of Christopher Priest. Retrieved April 29, 2019.\\"SDCC Interview: Hudlin, Cowan Say Christopher Priest Is Part Of Milestone 2.0\\" CBR.com. July 10, 2015 Davis left Milestone in 1995, after the imprint had launched, to become president of the new Motown Machine Works imprint, which was published by Image Comics. Cowan soon joined him to serve as editor in chief. All Milestone Media titles were set in a continuity dubbed the \\"Dakotaverse\\", referring to the fictional midwestern city of Dakota in which most of the early Milestone stories were set. Before any titles were published, an extensive \\"bible\\" was created by McDuffie and other early creators which provided back-story and information on all of the original Dakotaverse characters, as well as detailed information about the history and geography of Dakota. Cowan produced the original character sketches that served as a guide for the other artists. =Publishing deal= Although Milestone comics were published through DC Comics, they did not fall under DC Comics' editorial control; DC retained only the right not to publish any material they objected to. Milestone Media retained the copyright of their properties and had the final say on all merchandising and licensing deals pertaining to them. In essence, DC licensed the characters, editorial services, and creative content of the Milestone books for an annual fee and a share of the profits. Dwayne McDuffie said that DC held up this agreement even though some of Milestone's storylines made them \\"very uncomfortable\\" as they were from perspectives that DC weren't used to.Unfinished Milestone documentary; 01:50 to 00:58 The biggest conflict they had was when an issue of Static showed the hero kissing his girlfriend on a bed, with unopened condoms visible. DC didn't want to publish this cover on grounds that it was using sex to sell comics; Milestone covered most of the image as a compromise. McDuffie believed it made DC uncomfortable because it was specifically \\"black sexuality,\\" noting that the man who communicated DC‚Äôs concerns at the time was standing in front of a copy of Legionnaires #16, the cover of which depicts a blonde, white character in a revealing costume posing in a sexually suggestive position. Unfinished Milestone documentary;10:48 to 12:37 =Dakotaverse= In 1993, Milestone Media launched its first four titles: Hardware, Icon, Blood Syndicate and Static. At the same time, SkyBox and DC issued a trading card series, Milestone: The Dakota Universe (1993). A year later, Milestone Media published its first company-wide crossover, Shadow War, which spawned two more titles: Shadow Cabinet and Xombi. Another ongoing series, Kobalt, was introduced later. Milestone also participated in an intercompany crossover with DC, called \\"Worlds Collide\\" in which Metropolis-based superheroes from the DC Universe and Dakota-based superheroes from the Dakotaverse interacted temporarily. Milestone had several advantages in its publishing efforts: Their books were distributed and marketed by one of the \\"Big Two\\" comic book publishers, the comics industry had experienced remarkable increases in sales in preceding years, they featured the work of several well-known and critically acclaimed creators, they used a coloring process that gave their books a distinctive look, and they had the potential to appeal to an audience that was not being targeted by other publishers. They also suffered from several disadvantages: The comics market was experiencing a glut of \\"new universes\\" as several other publishers launched superhero lines around the same time (a slump would start in 1993 and a market crash in 1994), a significant number of retailers and readers perceived the Milestone books to be \\"comics for blacks\\" and assumed they would not interest non-African- American readers,Documentary 07:58 to 09:15 the books received limited exposure beyond existing comics-shop customers, the coloring process added slightly to the cover price of their books, and overall comics sales had peaked around the time of Milestone's launch and declined dramatically in the years that followed. Initial sales, however, were found to be decent ‚Äì albeit not as high as other companies. The perception of \\"comics for blacks\\" would be used by industry insiders to justify these early sales issues, ignoring the existence of the glut; few people at the time wanted to believe that the market conditions might be unsound and excuses were needed for why newer companies were struggling. Milestone cancelled several of its lower-selling series in 1995 and 1996, and aborted plans for several mini-series. Heroes, a new team book featuring Static and several of its more popular second-tier characters, was launched, but failed to sell well enough to justify an ongoing series. Milestone shut down its comic book division in 1997, with some of the remaining ongoing series discontinued in mid-story. It became primarily a licensing company, focusing on the Emmy Award and Humanitas Prize winning animated series Static Shock. In 2010, DC released a limited series titled Milestone Forever. Taking place in the original Milestone Universe, it detailed the final fate of several of Dakota's heroes and revealed the events that led to its earlier merger into the DC Universe. =DC Universe= The \\"Return to the Dakota Universe\\" panel at the 2017 New York Comic Con. From left to right: DC Vice President of Creative Affairs Dan Evans (at the podium), Kyle Baker, Denys Cowan, Derek T. Dingle, Reginald Hudlin, Alice Randall, Greg Pak, Ken Lashley, and Jim Lee. Close-ups of the panelists can be found here. In 2008, DC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio announced that the Milestone Universe and characters would be revived and merged into the DC Universe proper. Examples of the integration included Static joining the Teen Titans; Static, Icon, and Rocket appearing in the Young Justice TV series; various character appearances in Brave and the Bold; and the Shadow Cabinet appearing in Justice League of America. An ongoing series starring Static was included in the initial 2011 launch of The New 52, but was cancelled after six issues. In a January 2015 interview, writer Reginald Hudlin discussed a relaunch of Milestone Media Group, along with surviving co-founders Denys Cowan and Derek Dingle. The following July, DC Comics announced the creation of \\"Earth-M\\" within their multiverse, which would be home to the earlier Milestone characters as well as new ones, and that one or two Earth M imprint titles would be published annually, as well as miniseries and one-shots. No further developments took place until October 2017, when it was announced that Milestone would be returning in 2018 with five titles, including Milestone (featuring Icon and Rocket), a new Static series, Duo (based on the character Xombi), and two other new titles: Earth-M and Love Army. Charlotte Fullerton, Dwayne McDuffie's widow who inherited his 50% share in the original Milestone Media company, sued in August 2017 over being excluded from the revived company despite the new Milestone taking over the original's Milestone IPs. The line was finally revived in Milestone Returns #0 in September 2020. Staff Milestone's founders were joined in the company's formative years by young professionals who formed the early production team for the startup company. The first two non-founder employees of Milestone were Matt Wayne, a script and comic writer who became editor, then managing editor; and Christine Gilliam, the office manager‚Äìcum head of corporate communications. By January, 1993 Noelle Giddings, who had previously worked in comics as a colorist, became Milestone's color editor, supervising the line's painted art; and Joe James, an experienced graphic designer, served as designer and creative associate. Later the production staff would expand to include Erica Helene, Jason Medley, Jacqueline Ching, Joe Daniello, Andrew Burrell, Marcus Bennett, and Michelline Hess. Allen Epps was the CFO and Bob Stein was the legal counsel. In addition to using the talents of established creative professionals such as Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, M.D. Bright, and Mike Gustovich, Milestone hired new talent, many of whom went on to successful careers. Among them are John Paul Leon, Christopher Sotomayor, Christopher Williams (aka ChrisCross), Ivan Velez Jr., Shawn Martinbrough, Tommy Lee Edwards, Jason Scott Jones (aka J.Scott.J), Prentis Rollins, J.H. Williams III, Humberto Ramos, John Rozum, Eric Battle, Joseph Illidge, Madeleine Blaustein, Jamal Igle, Chris Batista, Harvey Richards, and Robert L. Washington III.

Chromosomal rearrangements are an important source of this variation. The term somaclonal variation is a phenomenon of broad taxonomic occurrence, reported for species of different ploidy levels, and for outcrossing and inbreeding, vegetatively and seed propagated, and cultivated and non-cultivated plants. Characters affected include both qualitative and quantitative traits. Somaclonal variation is not restricted to, but is particularly common in, plants regenerated from callus. The variations can be genotypic or phenotypic, which in the latter case can be either genetic or epigenetic in origin. Typical genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers (polyploidy and aneuploidy), chromosome structure (translocations, deletions, insertions and duplications) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related event would be gene methylation. If no visual, morphogenic changes are apparent, other plant screening procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to somaclonal variation. The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named somaclonal variation. Advantages The major likely benefit of somaclonal variation is plant/crop improvement. Somaclonal variation leads to the creation of additional genetic variability. Characteristics for which somaclonal mutants can be enriched during in vitro culture includes resistance to disease pathotoxins, herbicides, high salt concentration, mineral toxicity and tolerance to environmental or chemical stress, as well as for increased production of secondary metabolites. Suitable for breeding of new species. Disadvantages A serious disadvantage of somaclonal variation occurs in operations which require clonal uniformity, as in the horticulture and forestry industries where tissue culture is employed for rapid propagation of elite genotypes. * Sometimes leads to undesirable results * Selected variants are random and genetically unstable * Require extensive and extended field trials * Not suitable for complex agronomic traits like yield, quality etc. * May develop variants with pleiotropic effects. Reducing somaclonal variation Different steps can be used to reduce somaclonal variation. It is well known that increasing numbers of subculture increases the likelihood of somaclonal variation, so the number of subcultures in micropropagation protocols should be kept to a minimum. Regular reinitiation of clones from new explants might reduce variability over time. Another way of reducing somaclonal variation is to avoid 2,4-D in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce variation.

Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an ordinance passed in Hialeah, Florida, forbidding the \\"unnecessar[y]\\" killing of \\"an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption\\", was unconstitutional. Background Santer√≠a is an Afro-Cuban religion developed as a syncretism of Roman Catholicism and Yoruba religion by Yoruba people brought as slaves from Yorubaland to Cuba by the Atlantic slave trade.Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 at 524 (1993). Adherents believe they can fulfill their destiny through the aid of beings known as orishas, who subsist off blood from animal sacrifice.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 524. Animals, usually chickens, killed during ritual slaughter are then cooked and eaten by the celebrants, except during death and healing rituals, where sick energy is believed to have passed into the sacrifice.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 525. Santeria has been subject to widespread persecution in Cuba, so it is traditionally practiced in secret, employing saint symbolism. The Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc., is a Florida nonprofit organized in 1973 by Ernesto Pichardo, who was an Italero-level priest in the Santeria faith.Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, 723 F. Supp. 1467 (S.D. Fla. 1989). The Lucum√≠ language is used in the Santeria liturgy and Babal√∫-Ay√© is the spirit of wrath and disease. In April 1987, the Church leased a property at 173 W. 5th Street, Hialeah, in Miami-Dade County, Florida and announced its intention to use the site to openly practice the faith.Lukumi, 723 F. Supp. at 1477. The Hialeah City Council held an emergency public session on June 9, 1987.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 526. At the session, Councilman Silvio Cardoso stated that the religion is \\"in violation of everything this country stands for\\"; Councilman Andres Mejides observed that the Bible does not allow this particular type of animal sacrifice; and Councilman Julio Martinez noted (to audience applause) that in Cuba \\"people were put in jail for practicing this religion.\\"Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 541 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Hialeah's police chaplain testified that the Church worshipped \\"demons\\" and the city attorney testified that \\"This community will not tolerate religious practices abhorrent to its citizens.\\"Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Pichardo's brief testimony was met with taunts from the audience. At the end of the session the city council passed a resolution announcing its commitment to prohibit \\"all religious groups which are inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety‚Äù. The city further passed a resolution incorporating Florida's animal cruelty statute into the city code and the city attorney obtained a Florida Attorney General's Opinion from Bob Butterworth concluding that the state statute did not permit ritual animal sacrifice.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 527, citing Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 87-56, Annual Report of the Atty. Gen. 146, 147, 149 (1988). In September 1987, the city council unanimously passed three new ordinances that criminalized ‚Äúsacrifices of animals for any type of ritual, regardless of whether or not the flesh or blood of the animal is to be consumed.‚ÄùLukumi, 508 U.S. at 527. The city council exempted Kosher slaughterhouses, regular slaughterhouses, hunting, fishing, pest extermination, euthanasia of stray animals, and feeding live rabbits to greyhounds.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537. The Church sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On June 10, 1988, U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman granted absolute immunity to the individual city council members and the mayor.Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, 688 F. Supp. 1522 (S.D. Fla. 1988). On October 5, 1989, after a nine-day bench trial, Judge Spellman granted summary judgment to the city.Lukumi, 723 F. Supp. 1467. In 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unsigned one-paragraph per curiam decision, where it noted that Judge Spellman \\"employed an arguably stricter standard\\" than that applied in Employment Division v. Smith (1990), which had in the interim found Native Americans could be fired for their ritual use of peyote.936 F. 2d 586 (1991). In Smith, Justice Antonin Scalia had even cited Judge Spellman's opinion as authority, which the city highlighted in their appeals brief. The Court in Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) had explicitly provided Amish parents a religious exemption from mandatory school attendance under the Free Exercise Clause. However, in the years since, free-exercise claimants had lost every case before the Court, with the exception of a line of employment decisions cases terminated by Smith. The Church's petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States was granted, with Douglas Laycock appearing for the Church during oral arguments on November 4, 1992.https://www.oyez.org/cases/1992/91-948 Supreme Court =Opinion of the Court= On June 11, 1993, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in an Opinion of the Court joined in parts by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Byron White, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas concluded that the city's ordinances violated the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution. Kennedy read the Smith decision as requiring a compelling governmental interest if a law is not of neutral and general applicability.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531. Kennedy went on, in a section Souter and White refused to join, to conclude that although the ordinances were facially neutral, they were religiously ‚Äúgerrymandered with care‚Äù to only apply to religious killings.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542. Kennedy, in a section only joined by Stevens, details the ordinances‚Äô legislative history, even citing taped excerpts of the Hialeah City Council Meeting. Next, in a section Souter refused to join, Kennedy notes the numerous exemptions in the Florida statute, concluding the law is not generally applicable because it effectively applies ‚Äúonly against conduct motivated by religious belief.‚ÄùLukumi, 508 U.S. at 545. Finally, in a section joined by the full seven justice majority, Kennedy applies strict scrutiny, which the city ordinances fail.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 547. Because the ordinance suppressed more religious conduct than was necessary to achieve its stated ends, it was deemed unconstitutional, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, ‚Äúreligious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection‚Äù.\\"Criminal Law and Procedure By Daniel E. Hall - Cengage Learning, July 2008 - p. 266 =Scalia's concurrence in part= Justice Scalia joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, defended the Smith decision and attacked the use of legislative intent, opining that there would be no constitutional violation if ‚Äúthe Hialeah City Council set out resolutely to suppress the practices of Santeria, but ineptly adopted ordinances that failed to do so‚Äù.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 558 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). =Souter's concurrence in part= Justice Souter, writing alone for eighteen pages, noted that ‚ÄúThe Smith rule, in my view, may be reexamined consistently with principles of stare decisis.‚ÄùLukumi, 508 U.S. at 571 (Souter, J., concurring in part). =Blackmun's concurrence in the judgment= Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, concurred in the judgment only. Refusing to endorse the approach used in the majority opinion, Blackmun wrote, ‚ÄúI continue to believe that Smith was wrongly decided‚Äù. Blackmun goes on, citing an amicus curiae brief by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, to observe that had this case presented ‚Äúa law that sincerely pursued the goal of protecting animals from cruel treatment‚Äù, the result may have been different.Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 580 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). Subsequent developments Somewhat similarly in 2009, a freedom of religion case related to animal sacrifice was taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the case of Merced v. Kasson.Merced v. Kasson, 577 F.3d 578 (5th Cir. 2009). Merced was a Santeria priest and the president of Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., a Santeria religious group. He challenged Euless, Texas city ordinances prohibiting the slaughter of four-legged animals. The court ruled that the ordinances \\"substantially burden plaintiff's free exercise of religion without advancing a compelling governmental interest using the least restrictive means\\" and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city from enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating to the use of animals. The court did not reach Merced's claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

It is the only species in the genus Chamaea. Its systematics have been the subject of much debate, the wrentit having been placed in many different families by different authors for as long as it has been known to science. Its common name reflects the uncertainty, and its external resemblance to both tits and wrens. It is by no means closely related to either, however. Description Wrentit song The wrentit is a small, bird with uniform dull olive, brown, or grayish plumage. It has short wings and a long tail often held high (hence the comparison to wrens). It has a short bill and a pale iris. Given its retiring nature and loud voice, the wrentit is more likely to be detected by its call than by sight. The distinct sound that it makes is similar to the sound of a ping-pong ball falling on the table. Systematics The wrentit has been variously placed in its own family, the Chamaeidae, or with the long-tailed tits (Aegithalidae), the true tits and chickadees (Paridae), the \\"Old World warblers\\" (Sylviidae), and with the \\"Old World babblers\\" (Timaliidae). The American Ornithologists' Union places the wrentit in the latter family, giving it the distinction of being the only babbler known from the New World. This is based on DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridization studies, which are phenetic, however, and therefore not considered methodologically adequate today. Through DNA sequence analysis, it was subsequently discovered that the wrentit was more closely allied to Sylvia warblers and some aberrant \\"babblers\\". These consequently must be placed in the family Sylviidae together with the wrentit and the parrotbills which also turned out to be close relatives. Thus, the wrentit is the only American species of the \\"true\\" or sylviid warblers. Peculiarly, the Dartford warbler and close relatives like Marmora's warbler bear an uncanny resemblance to the wrentit; their ecology is quite similar indeed as all are birds of Mediterranean scrub. However, biogeography and the molecular data build a strong case for this similarity being a case of convergent evolution between birds that are close relatives but by far not as close as their appearance would suggest. Alice Cibois suggested that as some babblers are closer to typical warblers than these are to marsh-warblers for example, the Sylviidae should be merged into the Timaliidae. As such an abolishing of the senior synonym would require a formal International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruling and the typical warblers and relatives are still a monophyletic group at present, this proposal is not advanced by most researchers until the remaining Sylviidae and Timaliidae genera are studied as regards their relationships. Wrentit in the Marin Headlands on the California coast. Distribution The wrentit is a sedentary (non-migratory) resident of a narrow strip of coastal habitat in the western coast of North America, being found from Oregon south through California, to Baja California, the north state of the Baja California peninsula. It is usually restricted to certain chaparral and woodland habitats. It nests in high shrubs such as poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), coyote bush (Baccharis pilularis) and California blackberry (Rubus ursinus). Logging and other changes in habitat have led to this species expanding its range recently, particularly northwards. Ecology Wrentits mate for life, forming pair bonds only a few months after hatching. Both sexes sing; the faster rhythm of the male's song is one of the few ways to differentiate the sexes. Both sexes also defend their territory year-round and participate in building the nest, a four-stage process that takes about two weeks. The three or four eggs are incubated for 14 days, again by both sexes. The chicks fledge after 15 days (at which stage they are unable to fly) and are fed by their parents for another 40 days. The wrentit feeds by skulking through dense scrub gleaning exposed insects found by sight. It feeds primarily on beetles, caterpillars, bugs, and ants, but also takes small berries and seeds.

Blatz Translation: > (19) Jesus said: Blessed is he who was before he came into being. If you > become disciples to me (and) listen to my words, these stones will minister > to you. For you have five trees in Paradise which do not change, either in > summer or in winter, and their leaves do not fall. He who knows them shall > not taste of death. \\"Blessed is he who was before he came into being,\\" is similar to other enigmatic statements commonly found in mysticism across cultures, referring to the benefits of self-awareness (knowledge of one's true nature) before development of ego identity beliefs. \\"If you...listen..., these stones will minister to you,\\" may refer to both \\"listening\\" to the true self within ‚Äì which would allow one to accurately trace internal/cause from observing external/effects (physical reality/stones), or that only through this \\"self- awareness\\" are we able to understand Jesus' symbolic language and master external reality. The word, tree, is a creative (manifesting) symbol in Jewish and Christian sacred texts, descriptive of both ingesting (taking in) fruits and/or producing fruits (Genesis and Four Gospels). In the Acts of Thomas, Chapter 27, during an anointing ceremony, the apostle implores, \\"Come, elder of the five members of mind, communicate with these young men;\\" the five words for 'mind' according to Theodore Bar Konai are the equivalents of hauna (sanity), mad'a (reason), re'yana (mindfulness), mahshebhatha (imagination), tar'itha (intention) ‚Äì considered the Five Manifestations of the Father of Greatness which may provide the clue to the meaning of the five trees. These five would therefore be the causal factors in the experience of the Real. Marvin Meyer writes: \\"The \\"five trees\\" in paradise are mentioned frequently in gnostic texts, ordinarily without explanation or elaboration. In Manichaean Psalm Book 161,17-29, it is said that various features of life and faith are put together in groups of five. This section opens with the statement, 'For [five] are the trees that are in paradise ... in summer and winter.' On the trees in paradise according to Genesis, see Genesis 2:9.\\" Senses According to the Naassenes, paradise was the human head. It has been suggested that the \\"five trees\\" may parallel the five human senses which produce one's internal world view and belief system ‚Äì knowledge of which is a requirement for purification and thus enlightenment or return to paradise/unity. However, the body's five senses ‚Äì more synonymous with lower level egoism and learned misperception, would more likely be referenced as an impediment to reunion with the divine. Kabbalah The \\"five trees\\" also could be interpreted as referring to the Five Worlds of the mystical Jewish Kabbalah: Asiyah, Yetzirah, Beriah, Atzilut & Adam Kadmon ‚Äì descriptive of dimensional levels related to the soul's progress toward unity with or return to the Creator. Generally understood as developmental levels of intentionality related to man's natural \\"desire to receive\\". The methodology for accomplishing this is considered the secret Science of Kabbalah ‚Äì how to receive by correcting intention until a state of unity with pure altruism is achieved. One then becomes pure Creator (experience of the divine). Related to this, the concept of \\"reality as a mirror of desire\\" (pure desire = perfect results/impure desire = negative results), would correlate to the tree symbol as \\"productive\\" of paradise. These developmental levels are in parallel with five Partsufim. And these are same as soul levels: Nefesh, Ruah, Neshama, Haya and Yehida. Possibly these important Judaico-Biblical concepts are most similar to \\"five trees\\". Hindu parallels As noted from a Hindu reference page, which may also relate to The Gospel of Thomas's reference of the Five Trees, are the five trees of Indra's paradise. There is a theory that Jesus traveled to India during his \\"missing\\" years from in the Bible. This could support that theory. > The five trees (panca-vrksa) which adorn Lord Indra's garden (Nandana) in > his paradise (Svarga) are: #mandara (Erythrina stricta) with scarlet flowers > in horizontal clusters at the ends of branches; its shade relieves one of > physical ailments and mental stress; #parijata (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis) > with bark of gold, leaves of copper color, and fragrant, rejuvenate fruit; > it arose out of the ocean of milk and was taken away by Indra to his > paradise from where it was brought to Dvaraka by Lord Krsna at the instance > of his wife Satyabhama. After the passing away of the Lord and the > submerging of Dvaraka in the ocean, it was taken back to heaven; #samtanaka, > a tree of wonder having leaves which promote fertility in men; its > identification remains obscure; #haricandana or sandalwood (Santalum album) > well known for its fragrance and cooling effect, it keeps evil spirits at > bay; and #kalpa vrksa or kalpa taru, the tree of eternity which emerged as a > result of the churning of the ocean of milk; it was lifted to Svarga by > Indra, and is frequently mentioned in Sanskrit literature for its wish- > fulfilling quality.

Police officials connected him to at least 51 murder victims, mainly women, killed in a 15-year period, which began in 1928 and ended with his arrest in 1943. He was never given a trial, and some historians consider him innocent.Florian Stark: So starb der gr√∂√üte Serienm√∂rder der Kriminalgeschichte, Die Welt, 13 August 2018. Arrest Born in K√∂penick, L√ºdke had a mild intellectual disability (he could not, for example, tell interrogators how many minutes there were in an hour) and worked as a coachman. He was well known by the local police as a petty thief and peeping tom. On 31 January 1943 a woman was found murdered in the woods near K√∂penick, strangled with her own shawl. The victim showed signs of post-mortem sexual abuse and her purse was missing. Police brought in L√ºdke for questioning on 18 March 1943, where he quickly confessed to murdering not only the woman but also several other victims, and was taken into custody. Witnesses report L√ºdke showed signs of physical abuse and he stated that \\"they would kill me if I didn't confess\\". L√ºdke was never put on trial for any of the killings. Declared insane, he was sent to the SS-run Institute of Criminological Medicine in Vienna, where medical experiments were carried out on him until his death, when an experiment went wrong in 1944. Controversy The 50-odd crime scenes showed no similarities in modus operandi, signature, or motive. No fingerprints were ever found and no evidence against L√ºdke has ever been presented. A Dutch former Chief of police named Jan Blaauw investigated original police reports, finding them inconclusive, incoherent, and vague. He also expressed his disbelief that a semi-illiterate, who once got caught stealing a chicken, could evade authorities for nearly 20 years, let alone get away with murder. Many believe L√ºdke to be the victim of a frame-up, carried out by an ambitious Kriminalkommissar (Detective Captain) Franz, the heavily censored Reichskriminalpolizeiamt, and the Nazi government, that had little patience with people with intellectual disabilities. A 1957 movie, Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam, affirmed the image of L√ºdke as one of Germany's worst serial killers. Attempts at reopening the case by members of the Kriminalrat (Detective Major) Faulhaber yielded no results. The true nature of the 51 murders remains unsolved.

Turiya is the background that underlies and pervades the three common states of consciousness. The three common states of consciousness are: waking state, dreaming state, and dreamless deep sleep.http://bhagavan- ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/tw/tw617.html Mandukya Upanishad Turiya is discussed in Verse 7 of the Mandukya Upanishad; however, the idea is found in the oldest Upanishads. For example, Chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \\"four states of consciousness\\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep.PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University New York Press, , pages 32-33; Quote: \\"We can see that this story [in Chandogya Upanishad] is an anticipation of the Mandukya doctrine, (...)\\"Robert Hume, Chandogya Upanishad - Eighth Prathapaka, Seventh through Twelfth Khanda, Oxford University Press, pages 268-273 Similarly, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in chapter 5.14 discusses Turiya state, as does Maitri Upanishad in sections 6.19 and 7.11. Verse VII of the Mandukya Upanishad describes Turiya: The insight during meditation of Turiya is known as amƒÅtra, the 'immeasurable' or 'measureless' in the Mandukya Upanishad, being synonymous with samƒÅdhi in Yoga terminology.Goldberg, Ellen (2002). Ardhanarishvara: The Lord who is Half Woman, p. 85 Understanding of Turiya =Advaita Vedanta= Advaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (su·π£upti), which are empirically experienced by human beings,Arvind Sharma (2004), Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Ved√•nta, State University of New York Press, page 3William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 57-60 and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine: # The first state is the waking state, in which we are aware of our daily world.Arvind Sharma (2004), Sleep as the State of Consciousness in Advaita Ved√•nta, State University of New York Press, pages 15-40, 49-72 This is the gross body. # The second state is the dreaming mind. This is the subtle body. # The third state is the state of deep sleep. This is the causal body. Advaita also posits the fourth state of Turiya, which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya is the state of liberation, where according to the Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all pervading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self- consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta.; ; Advaita traces the foundation of this ontological theory in more ancient Sanskrit texts.PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University New York Press, , pages 32-33 For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \\"four states of consciousness\\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep. One of the earliest mentions of Turiya, in the Hindu scriptures, occurs in verse 5.14.3 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.; Sanskrit (Wikisource): ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡•ã‡§Ω‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•ã ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§® ‡§á‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§µ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞ ‡§π ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à ‡§™‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§è‡§§‡§¶‡•Å ‡§π‡•à‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§è‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§¶‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§§‡§æ‡§µ‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ú‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ω‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§è‡§§‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶ ‡§Ö‡§•‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§è‡§§‡§¶‡•á‡§µ ‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§§‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡•ã‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ ‡§Ø ‡§è‡§∑ ‡§§‡§™‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡•à ‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§Ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§§‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¶‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§¶‡§¶‡•É‡§∂ ‡§á‡§µ ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§∑ ‡§™‡§∞‡•ã‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡•Å ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ‡•à‡§∑ ‡§∞‡§ú ‡§â‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§™‡§∞‡§ø ‡§§‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ç ‡§è‡§µ ‡§π‡•à‡§µ ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§∂‡§∏‡§æ ‡§§‡§™‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ω‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§è‡§§‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶ ‡•• ‡•© ‡•• The idea is also discussed in other early Upanishads. Gaudapada Gaudapada (ca. 7th century) was an early guru in the Advaita Vedanta. Gaudapada is traditionally said to have been the grand-guru of the great teacher, Adi Shankara, one of the most important figures in Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada is believed to be the founder of Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, and the author or compiler of the . Gaudapada wrote or compiled the , also known as the and as the . In this work, Gaudapada deals with perception, idealism, causality, truth, and reality. The fourth state, (turƒ´ya avasthƒÅ), corresponds to silence, as the other three correspond to AUM. It is the substratum of the other three states. It is, states Nakamura, atyanta-shunyata (absolute emptiness). Michael Comans disagrees with Nakamura's thesis that \\"the fourth realm (caturtha) was perhaps influenced by the Sunyata of Mahayana Buddhism.\\" According to Comans, Comans further refers to Nakamura himself, who notes that later Mahayana sutras such as the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra and the concept of Buddha-nature, were influenced by Vedantic thought. Comans concludes that Isaeva states that there are differences in the teachings in the texts of Buddhism and the Mandukya Upanishad of Hinduism, because the latter asserts that citta \\"consciousness\\" is identical with the eternal and immutable atman \\"soul, self\\" of the Upanishads. In other words, Mandukya Upanishad and Gaudapada affirm the soul exists, while Buddhist schools affirm that there is no soul or self.KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; Quote: \\"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattƒÅ, Sanskrit: anƒÅtman, the opposed doctrine of ƒÅtman is central to Brahmanical thought).

State University of New York Pressadvaita.org.uk, ‚ÄòOm‚Äô ‚Äì three states and one reality (An interpretation of the Mandukya Upanishad) which correspond to the three bodies: * The first state is that of waking consciousness, in which we are aware of our daily world. \\"It is described as outward-knowing (bahish- prajnya), gross (sthula) and universal (vaishvanara)\\". This is the gross body. * The second state is that of the dreaming mind. \\"It is described as inward- knowing (antah-prajnya), subtle (pravivikta), and burning (taijasa)\\". This is the subtle body. * The third state is the state of deep sleep.

This is the causal body. In the waking consciousness, there is a sense of 'I' (self-identity) and awareness of thoughts. In the sleep or dream state, there is no or little sense of 'I'; however, there are thoughts and the awareness of thoughts.

Early life and career Bonet studied ceramics in the school of arts, but eventually decided to dedicate herself to music. She arrived in Barcelona in 1967, where she began to sing with the group Els Setze Jutges. She has published many folk music albums in Catalan, in spite of the ban on the Catalan language and its music during Francisco Franco's dictatorship. She has performed throughout China as well as in Japan, the former USSR, Tunisia, Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland, Venezuela, Mexico, and the United States. Recording career In 1981, Bonet recorded Jard√≠ Tancat in Paris, along with accompaniment by Jacques Denjean and noted Breton harpist Alan Stivell. She has worked with the Ensemble of Music Traditionelle di Tunis and Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento. She earned the French Charles Cross Academy Prize and the Catalan Creu de Sant Jordi and the National Prize awarded by the Catalan government. In 1984, the French Government gave her the Charles Cross Academy Award for the best foreign record released in France. That same year Bonet was awarded the Cross of Saint George, the highest distinction of the Generalitat de Catalunya (the Catalan Government). In 1985, as a result of her interest and research into North African music, she recorded Anells d‚Äôaigua (Rings of Water) with the Ensemble de Musique Traditionelle of Tunisia, and then toured with the group throughout France and Spain. In 1998 she toured abroad and collaborated with other well- known Spanish artists such as Amancio Prada, Loquillo, Jordi Sabat√©s and Rosa Verg√©s. In 2001, Bonet recorded a Jackson Browne tribute album, Sing My Songs. The album was recorded live in July 2001 in the Gothic district of Barcelona. The album won the 2002 Spanish World Music Awards.

He has been a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., since 1977. Before 1977, Downs served for 18 years a member and then Chairman of Real Estate Research Corporation, a nationwide consultancy advising private and public decision- makers on real estate investment, housing policies, and urban affairs. He also served as a Senior Analyst at the RAND Corporation and a professor at the University of Chicago.  Education  Downs received a B.A. in international relations and political theory from Carleton College in 1952, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from Stanford University in 1956. In An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957), an early work in rational choice theory, Downs posited the paradox of voting, which claimed that significant elements of political life could not be explained in terms of voter self-interest. Downs showed that in democracies the aggregate distribution of political opinion forms a bell- shaped curve, with most voters possessing moderate opinions; he argued that this fact forces political parties in democracies to adopt centrist positions.W. Hayward Rogers, Some Methodological Difficulties in Anthony Downs's An Economic Theory of Democracy, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 53, No. 2 (Jun., 1959), pp. 483-485.  Career  Downs has served as a consultant to many of the nation's largest corporations and public institutions, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to the National Commission on Urban Problems in 1967, and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp appointed him to the Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing in 1989. He is officer or trustee of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He is the author or co-author of 24 books and over 500 articles. His most influential books are An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957) and Inside Bureaucracy (1967); widely translated, both are credited as major influences on the public choice school of political economy. Later, Downs concerned himself with housing policy,Anthony Downs, The Impact of Housing Policies on Family Life in the United States since World War II, Daedalus, Vol. 106, No. 2, The Family (Spring, 1977), pp. 163-180. writing about rent control and affordable housing. The Revolution in Real Estate Finance (1985) predicted a long-term housing slowdown and decrease in housing prices. Downs has involved himself with transportation economics. In 1962, Downs published his Down's Law of Peak-Hour Traffic Congestion. This Law states that on urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion rises to meet maximum capacity. Therefore, expanding the expressway network does not help against traffic jams. A complex set of forces lie behind this Law, which were analyzed by presentation of a model of commuter decision-making and its underlying set of assumptions.http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=694596 By the same token, e.g. the 1965 Highway Capacity Manual stated that the capacity of a highway or motorway increases with decreasing traffic speed, till its maximum capacity is reached at about 50 km/h (30 mph).Highway Capacity Manual 1965, figures 3.38‚Äì3.45 (Cf. Braess's paradox.) His book Stuck in Traffic (1992), which detailed the economic disadvantages of traffic congestion and proposed road pricing as the only effective means of alleviating it, was denounced by traffic engineers for its insistence on the futility of congestion relief measures. However, enough of his gloomy predictions about congestion were proven right that he successfully published a second edition, Still Stuck in Traffic (2004). Downs' recommendations are starting to see implementation, largely in the form of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes in the medians of crowded American freeways, and through congestion pricing, already implemented in several cities around the world: Singapore\\"Road pricing: Singapore's experience\\" (see Area Licensing Scheme and Electronic Road Pricing); London (see London congestion charge); Stockholm (see Stockholm congestion tax); Valletta, Malta;\\"Controlled Vehicular Access\\" , CVA Technology, 1 May 2007\\"Valletta traffic congestion considerably reduced\\" and Milan, Italy.\\"Milan introduces traffic charge\\", BBC\\"Milan Introduces Congestion Charge To Cut Pollution\\", New York Sun\\"Congestion fee leaves Milan in a jam\\" He was a Visiting Fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco, from June 2004 until March 2005.  Thought  = The left‚Äìright continuum = In his seminal work An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957), Downs introduced a left‚Äìright axis to economic theory.Conceptualising the left-right continuum as an enduring dimension of political competition, European University Institute, 1996, p. 8. On the \\"left\\" he placed communist parties that want entirely state-planned economies, and on the \\"right\\" he placed conservative parties that demand an entirely deregulated economy. He claimed that most voters have incomplete information when voting for political candidates in a democracy, and therefore will resort to economic issues of \\"how much government intervention in the economy there should be\\" and how parties will control this. Downs borrowed the curve from Harold Hotelling, who developed it to explain how grocery stores targeted customers. Downs' book has since become one of the most cited books in political science. His left‚Äìright axis model has been integrated into the median voter theory first articulated by Duncan Black.

It is typically computer-implemented, and provides the basis of many practical applications. Knowing the system state is necessary to solve many control theory problems; for example, stabilizing a system using state feedback. In most practical cases, the physical state of the system cannot be determined by direct observation. Instead, indirect effects of the internal state are observed by way of the system outputs. A simple example is that of vehicles in a tunnel: the rates and velocities at which vehicles enter and leave the tunnel can be observed directly, but the exact state inside the tunnel can only be estimated. If a system is observable, it is possible to fully reconstruct the system state from its output measurements using the state observer.  Typical observer model  Linear, sliding mode and cubic observers are among several observer structures used for state estimation of linear systems. A linear observer structure is described in the following sections. = Discrete-time case = The state of a linear, time-invariant physical discrete-time system is assumed to satisfy : x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k) : y(k) = C x(k) + D u(k) where, at time k, x(k) is the plant's state; u(k) is its inputs; and y(k) is its outputs. These equations simply say that the plant's current outputs and its future state are both determined solely by its current states and the current inputs. (Although these equations are expressed in terms of discrete time steps, very similar equations hold for continuous systems). If this system is observable then the output of the plant, y(k), can be used to steer the state of the state observer. The observer model of the physical system is then typically derived from the above equations. Additional terms may be included in order to ensure that, on receiving successive measured values of the plant's inputs and outputs, the model's state converges to that of the plant. In particular, the output of the observer may be subtracted from the output of the plant and then multiplied by a matrix L; this is then added to the equations for the state of the observer to produce a so-called Luenberger observer, defined by the equations below. Note that the variables of a state observer are commonly denoted by a \\"hat\\": \\\\hat{x}(k) and \\\\hat{y}(k) to distinguish them from the variables of the equations satisfied by the physical system. : \\\\hat{x}(k+1) = A \\\\hat{x}(k) + L \\\\left[y(k) - \\\\hat{y}(k)\\\\right] + B u(k) : \\\\hat{y}(k) = C \\\\hat{x}(k) + D u(k) The observer is called asymptotically stable if the observer error e(k) = \\\\hat{x}(k) - x(k) converges to zero when k \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty . For a Luenberger observer, the observer error satisfies e(k+1) = (A - LC) e(k). The Luenberger observer for this discrete-time system is therefore asymptotically stable when the matrix A - LC has all the eigenvalues inside the unit circle. For control purposes the output of the observer system is fed back to the input of both the observer and the plant through the gains matrix K. : u(k)= -K \\\\hat{x}(k) The observer equations then become: : \\\\hat{x}(k+1) = A \\\\hat{x}(k) + L \\\\left(y(k) - \\\\hat{y}(k)\\\\right) - B K \\\\hat{x}(k) : \\\\hat{y}(k) = C \\\\hat{x}(k) - D K \\\\hat{x}(k) or, more simply, : \\\\hat{x}(k+1) = \\\\left(A - B K \\\\right) \\\\hat{x}(k) + L \\\\left(y(k) - \\\\hat{y}(k)\\\\right) : \\\\hat{y}(k) = \\\\left(C - D K\\\\right) \\\\hat{x}(k) Due to the separation principle we know that we can choose K and L independently without harm to the overall stability of the systems. As a rule of thumb, the poles of the observer A-LC are usually chosen to converge 10 times faster than the poles of the system A-BK. = Continuous- time case = The previous example was for an observer implemented in a discrete-time LTI system. However, the process is similar for the continuous- time case; the observer gains L are chosen to make the continuous-time error dynamics converge to zero asymptotically (i.e., when A-LC is a Hurwitz matrix). For a continuous-time linear system : \\\\dot{x} = A x + B u, : y = C x + D u, where x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m ,y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^r, the observer looks similar to discrete-time case described above: : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{x}} = A \\\\hat{x}+ B u + L \\\\left(y - \\\\hat{y}\\\\right) . : \\\\hat{y} = C \\\\hat{x} + D u, The observer error e=x-\\\\hat{x} satisfies the equation : \\\\dot{e} = (A - LC) e. The eigenvalues of the matrix A-LC can be chosen arbitrarily by appropriate choice of the observer gain L when the pair [A,C] is observable, i.e. observability condition holds. In particular, it can be made Hurwitz, so the observer error e(t) \\\\rightarrow 0 when t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. = Peaking and other observer methods = When the observer gain L is high, the linear Luenberger observer converges to the system states very quickly. However, high observer gain leads to a peaking phenomenon in which initial estimator error can be prohibitively large (i.e., impractical or unsafe to use). As a consequence, nonlinear high gain observer methods are available that converge quickly without the peaking phenomenon. For example, sliding mode control can be used to design an observer that brings one estimated state's error to zero in finite time even in the presence of measurement error; the other states have error that behaves similarly to the error in a Luenberger observer after peaking has subsided. Sliding mode observers also have attractive noise resilience properties that are similar to a Kalman filter. Another approach is to apply multi observer, that significantly improves transients and reduces observer overshoot. Multi observer can be adapted to every system where High Gain Observer is applicable. Cubic observersShare Pasand MM. Luenberger-type cubic observers for state estimation of linear systems. Int J Adapt Control Signal Process. 2020;1‚Äì14. https://doi.org/10.1002/acs.3125 are proposed as well to enhance observation performance. These observers contain a cubic term in their estimation error dynamics. A cubic observer may be used to reduce the peaking phenomenon and increase observer performance. The cubic observer is described by the following equations: \\\\dot{\\\\hat{x}}=A\\\\hat{x}+L(y-C\\\\hat{x})-(y-C\\\\hat{x})^T \\\\theta(y-C\\\\hat{x})N(y-C\\\\hat{x}) The estimation error dynamics of this observer are described as: \\\\dot{e}=(A-LC)e+e^TC^T\\\\theta CeNCe The estimation error dynamics will be stable if there exists a positive definite symmetric matrix P=P^T>0 satisfying: \\\\begin{cases} (A-LC)^TP+P(A-LC)<0\\\\\\\\\\\\PNC+C^TN^TP<0 \\\\end{cases} Matrix N can be chosen as N=-aP^{-1} C^T\\\\theta ; a>0 . This choice guarantees stability and uniqueness of the origin as the equilibrium point of the estimation error dynamics.  State observers for nonlinear systems  High gain, sliding mode and extended observers are the most common observers for nonlinear systems. To illustrate the application of sliding mode observers for nonlinear systems, first consider the no-input non-linear system: : \\\\dot{x} = f(x) where x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Also assume that there is a measurable output y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} given by : y = h(x). There are several non- approximate approaches for designing an observer. The two observers given below also apply to the case when the system has an input. That is, : \\\\dot{x} = f(x) + B(x) u, : y = h(x), . = Linearizable error dynamics = One suggestion by Krener and Isidori and Krener and Respondek can be applied in a situation when there exists a linearizing transformation (i.e., a diffeomorphism, like the one used in feedback linearization) z=\\\\Phi(x) such that in new variables the system equations read : \\\\dot{z} = A z+ \\\\phi(y), : y = Cz. The Luenberger observer is then designed as : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{z}} = A \\\\hat{z}+ \\\\phi(y) - L \\\\left(C \\\\hat{z}-y \\\\right) . The observer error for the transformed variable e=\\\\hat{z}-z satisfies the same equation as in classical linear case. : \\\\dot{e} = (A - LC) e. As shown by Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman and Hammouri and Kinnaert, if there exists transformation z=\\\\Phi(x) such that the system can be transformed into the form : \\\\dot{z} = A(u(t)) z+ \\\\phi(y,u(t) ), : y = Cz, then the observer is designed as : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{z}} = A(u(t)) \\\\hat{z}+ \\\\phi(y,u(t) ) - L(t) \\\\left(C \\\\hat{z}-y \\\\right) , where L(t) is a time-varying observer gain. Ciccarella, Dalla Mora, and Germani obtained more advanced and general results, removing the need for a nonlinear transform and proving global asymptotic convergence of the estimated state to the true state using only simple assumptions on regularity. = Sliding mode observer = As discussed for the linear case above, the peaking phenomenon present in Luenberger observers justifies the use of a sliding mode observer. The sliding mode observer uses non-linear high-gain feedback to drive estimated states to a hypersurface where there is no difference between the estimated output and the measured output. The non-linear gain used in the observer is typically implemented with a scaled switching function, like the signum (i.e., sgn) of the estimated ‚Äì measured output error. Hence, due to this high-gain feedback, the vector field of the observer has a crease in it so that observer trajectories slide along a curve where the estimated output matches the measured output exactly. So, if the system is observable from its output, the observer states will all be driven to the actual system states. Additionally, by using the sign of the error to drive the sliding mode observer, the observer trajectories become insensitive to many forms of noise. Hence, some sliding mode observers have attractive properties similar to the Kalman filter but with simpler implementation. As suggested by Drakunov, a sliding mode observer can also be designed for a class of non-linear systems. Such an observer can be written in terms of original variable estimate \\\\hat{x} and has the form : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{x}} = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{\\\\partial H(\\\\hat{x})}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right]^{-1} M(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\, \\\\operatorname{sgn}( V(t) - H(\\\\hat{x}) ) where: * The \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\mathord{\\\\cdot}) vector extends the scalar signum function to n dimensions. That is, :: \\\\operatorname{sgn}(z) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\operatorname{sgn}(z_1)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sgn}(z_2)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sgn}(z_i)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sgn}(z_n) \\\\end{bmatrix} : for the vector z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. * The vector H(x) has components that are the output function h(x) and its repeated Lie derivatives. In particular, :: H(x) \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_1(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_2(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_3(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_n(x) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix} h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{f}h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{f}^2 h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{f}^{n-1}h(x) \\\\end{bmatrix} : where L^i_f h is the ith Lie derivative of output function h along the vector field f (i.e., along x trajectories of the non-linear system). In the special case where the system has no input or has a relative degree of n, H(x(t)) is a collection of the output y(t)=h(x(t)) and its n-1 derivatives. Because the inverse of the Jacobian linearization of H(x) must exist for this observer to be well defined, the transformation H(x) is guaranteed to be a local diffeomorphism. * The diagonal matrix M(\\\\hat{x}) of gains is such that :: M(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\triangleq \\\\operatorname{diag}( m_1(\\\\hat{x}), m_2(\\\\hat{x}), \\\\ldots, m_n(\\\\hat{x}) ) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} m_1(\\\\hat{x}) & & & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & m_2(\\\\hat{x}) & & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\ddots & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & m_i(\\\\hat{x}) & &\\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & \\\\ddots &\\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & & m_n(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\end{bmatrix} : where, for each i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, element m_i(\\\\hat{x}) > 0 and suitably large to ensure reachability of the sliding mode. * The observer vector V(t) is such that :: V(t) \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix}v_{1}(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_2(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_3(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_i(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_{n}(t) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix} y(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ m_1(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_1(t) - h_1(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ m_2(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_2(t) - h_2(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ m_{i-1}(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_{i-1}(t) - h_{i-1}(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ m_{n-1}(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_{n-1}(t) - h_{n-1}(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}} \\\\end{bmatrix} : where \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\mathord{\\\\cdot}) here is the normal signum function defined for scalars, and \\\\\\\\{ \\\\ldots \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}} denotes an \\"equivalent value operator\\" of a discontinuous function in sliding mode. The idea can be briefly explained as follows. According to the theory of sliding modes, in order to describe the system behavior, once sliding mode starts, the function \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_{i}(t)\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\! h_{i}(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) should be replaced by equivalent values (see equivalent control in the theory of sliding modes). In practice, it switches (chatters) with high frequency with slow component being equal to the equivalent value. Applying appropriate lowpass filter to get rid of the high frequency component on can obtain the value of the equivalent control, which contains more information about the state of the estimated system. The observer described above uses this method several times to obtain the state of the nonlinear system ideally in finite time. The modified observation error can be written in the transformed states e=H(x)-H(\\\\hat{x}). In particular, : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{e} = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} H(x) \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} H(\\\\hat{x})\\\\\\\\\\\\ = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} H(x) \\\\- M(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\, \\\\operatorname{sgn}( V(t) - H(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ), \\\\end{cases} and so : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{e}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{e}_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{e}_i\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{e}_{n-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{e}_n \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{h}_1(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{h}_2(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{h}_i(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{h}_{n-1}(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{h}_n(x) \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\tfrac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} H(x)}} \\\\- \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{ M(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\, \\\\operatorname{sgn}( V(t) - H(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) }^{\\\\tfrac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} H(\\\\hat{x})}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_2(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_3(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_{i+1}(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_n(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ L_f^n h(x) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\- \\\\begin{bmatrix} m_1 \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_1(t) - h_1(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ m_2 \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_2(t) - h_2(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ m_i \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_i(t) - h_i(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{n-1} \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_{n-1}(t) - h_{n-1}(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ m_n \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_n(t) - h_n(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\\\\\\\\\ = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_2(x) - m_1(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{ \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{v_1(t)}^{v_1(t) = y(t) = h_1(x)}} - h_1(\\\\hat{x}(t)) }^{e_1}} )\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_3(x) - m_2(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_2(t) - h_2(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_{i+1}(x) - m_i(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_i(t) - h_i(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ h_n(x) - m_{n-1}(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_{n-1}(t) - h_{n-1}(\\\\hat{x}(t)) )\\\\\\\\\\\\ L_f^n h(x) - m_n(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( v_n(t) - h_n(\\\\hat{x}(t)) ) \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{cases} So: # As long as m_1(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\geq h_2(x(t)), the first row of the error dynamics, \\\\dot{e}_1 = h_2(\\\\hat{x}) - m_1(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( e_1 ), will meet sufficient conditions to enter the e_1 = 0 sliding mode in finite time. # Along the e_1 = 0 surface, the corresponding v_2(t) = \\\\\\\\{m_1(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( e_1 )\\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}} equivalent control will be equal to h_2(x), and so v_2(t) - h_2(\\\\hat{x}) = h_2(x) - h_2(\\\\hat{x}) = e_2. Hence, so long as m_2(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\geq h_3(x(t)), the second row of the error dynamics, \\\\dot{e}_2 = h_3(\\\\hat{x}) - m_2(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( e_2 ), will enter the e_2 = 0 sliding mode in finite time. # Along the e_i = 0 surface, the corresponding v_{i+1}(t) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}_{\\\\text{eq}} equivalent control will be equal to h_{i+1}(x). Hence, so long as m_{i+1}(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\geq h_{i+2}(x(t)), the (i+1)th row of the error dynamics, \\\\dot{e}_{i+1} = h_{i+2}(\\\\hat{x}) - m_{i+1}(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}( e_{i+1} ), will enter the e_{i+1} = 0 sliding mode in finite time. So, for sufficiently large m_i gains, all observer estimated states reach the actual states in finite time. In fact, increasing m_i allows for convergence in any desired finite time so long as each h_i(x(0)) function can be bounded with certainty. Hence, the requirement that the map H:\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^n is a diffeomorphism (i.e., that its Jacobian linearization is invertible) asserts that convergence of the estimated output implies convergence of the estimated state. That is, the requirement is an observability condition. In the case of the sliding mode observer for the system with the input, additional conditions are needed for the observation error to be independent of the input. For example, that : \\\\frac{\\\\partial H(x)}{\\\\partial x} B(x) does not depend on time. The observer is then : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{x}} = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial H(\\\\hat{x})}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right]^{-1} M(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\operatorname{sgn}(V(t) - H(\\\\hat{x}))+B(\\\\hat{x})u.  Multi Observer  Multi observer extends High Gain Observer structure from single to multi observer, with many models working simultaneously. This has two layers: the first consists of multiple High Gain Observers with different estimation states, and the second determines the importance weights of the first layer observers. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not contain any risky operations like differentiation. The idea of multiple models was previously applied to obtain information in adaptive control . Multi observer.pngMulti Observer Schema Assume that the number of High Gain Observers equals n+1 \\\\dot{\\\\hat{x_k}}(t) = A \\\\hat{x_k}(t)+ B \\\\phi_0(\\\\hat{x}(t), u(t)) - L (\\\\hat{y_k}(t)-y(t)) \\\\hat{y_k}(t) = C \\\\hat{x_k}(t) where k = 1...n + 1 is the observer index. The first layer observers consists of the same gain L but they differ with the initial state x_k(0) . In the second layer all x_k(t) from k = 1...n + 1 observers are combined into one to obtain single state vector estimation \\\\hat{y_k}(t) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\alpha_k(t) \\\\hat{x_k}(t) where \\\\alpha_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} are weight factors. These factors are changed to provide the estimation in the second layer and to improve the observation process. Let assume that \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\alpha_k(t) \\\\xi_k(t) = 0 and \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\alpha_k(t) = 1 where \\\\xi_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 1} is some vector that depends on kth observer error e_k(t) . Some transformation yields to linear regression problem [- \\\\xi_{n + 1} (t)] = [\\\\xi_{1}(t) - \\\\xi_{n + 1}(t)\\\\dots \\\\xi_{k}(t) - \\\\xi_{n + 1}(t)\\\\dots \\\\xi_{n}(t) - \\\\xi_{n + 1}(t)]^T \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha_1(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_k(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_n(t) \\\\end{bmatrix} This formula gives possibility to estimate \\\\alpha_k (t) . To construct manifold we need mapping m: \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} between \\\\xi_k (t) = m(e_k(t)) and ensurance that \\\\xi_k (t) is calculable relying on measurable signals. First thing is to eliminate parking phenomenon for \\\\alpha_k(t) from observer error e_{\\\\sigma}(t) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\alpha_k(t) e_k(t) . Calculate n times derivative on \\\\eta_k(t)=\\\\hat y_k (t) - y(t) to find mapping m lead to \\\\xi_k(t) defined as \\\\xi_k (t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ CL & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ CAL & CL & 1 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ CA^{2}L & CAL & CL & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\\\\\\\\\ CA^{n-2}L & CA^{n-3}L & CA^{n-4}L & \\\\cdots & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\int\\\\limits^t_{t-t_d} {{n-1} \\\\atop \\\\cdots} \\\\int\\\\limits^t_{t-t_d} \\\\eta_k(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta(t) - \\\\eta(t-(n-1)t_d) \\\\end{bmatrix} where t_d > 0 is some time constant. Note that \\\\xi_k(t) relays on both \\\\eta_k(t) and its integrals hence it is easily available in the control system. Further \\\\alpha_k(t) is specified by estimation law; and thus it proves that manifold is measurable. In the second layer \\\\hat\\\\alpha_k(t) for k = 1 \\\\dots n + 1 is introduced as estimates of \\\\alpha_k(t) coefficients. The mapping error is specified as e_\\\\xi(t) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\hat\\\\alpha_k(t) \\\\xi_k(t) where e_\\\\xi(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 1}, \\\\hat\\\\alpha_k(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} . If coefficients \\\\hat\\\\alpha(t) are equal to \\\\alpha_k(t) , then mapping error e_\\\\xi(t) = 0 Now it is possible to calculate \\\\hat x from above equation and hence the peaking phenomenon is reduced thanks to properties of manifold. The created mapping gives a lot of flexibility in the estimation process. Even it is possible to estimate the value of x(t) in the second layer and to calculate the state x.  Bounding observers  The Boundinghttp://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/prost/proceedings/ecc03/pdfs/437.pdf or Interval observershttp://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/prost/proceedings/cdc-2008/data/papers/1446.pdfhttps://hal.archives- ouvertes.fr/hal-01276439/ constitute a class of observers that provide two estimations of the state simultaneously: one of the estimations provides an upper bound on the real value of the state, whereas the second one provides a lower bound. The real value of the state is then known to be always within these two estimations. These bounds are very important in practical applications,http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2010/WCE2010_pp656-661.pdf as they make possible to know at each time the precision of the estimation. Mathematically, two Luenberger observers can be used, if L is properly selected, using, for example, positive systems properties:Ait Rami, M., Tadeo, F., Helmke, U. (2011), \\"Positive observers for linear positive systems, and their implications\\", International Journal of Control 84 one for the upper bound \\\\hat{x}_U(k) (that ensures that e(k) = \\\\hat{x}_U(k) - x(k) converges to zero from above when k \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty , in the absence of noise and uncertainty), and a lower bound \\\\hat{x}_L(k) (that ensures that e(k) = \\\\hat{x}_L(k) - x(k) converges to zero from below). That is, always \\\\hat{x}_U(k) \\\\ge x(k) \\\\ge \\\\hat{x}_L(k)  See also  * Moving horizon estimation * Kalman filter * Extended Kalman filter * Positive systems  References  ; In-line references ; General references * Category:Classical control theory Category:Time series ","title":"State observer"},{"id":"1261175","text":"Two ships of the United States Navy have borne the name Brownson, in honor of Rear Admiral Willard H.

He taught at the University of Cambridge for eight years, before taking up the position of Henry Luce Professor of Individual and Collective Memory at Washington University in St. Louis, where he teaches classes on evolutionary psychology and anthropology.Official home page He was a Guggenheim Fellow and a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Lyon, France. He studied philosophy and anthropology at University of Paris and Cambridge, with Jack Goody, working on memory constraints on the transmission of oral literature. Work Pascal Boyer, an anthropologist, studies how human biases and cognitive faculties have resulted in or encouraged cultural phenomena. He advocates the idea that human evolution resulted in specialized capacities that guide our social relations, culture, and predilections toward religious beliefs. Boyer and others propose that these cognitive mechanisms make the acquisition of ‚Äúreligious‚Äù themes, like concepts of spirits, ghosts, ancestors or gods, highly transmissible within a community. Boyer has conducted long term ethnographic fieldwork in Cameroon, where he studied the transmission of Fang oral epics and its traditional religion. Most of his later work consists of experimental study of cognitive capacities underlying cultural transmission. He also conducted studies on supernatural concepts and their retention in memory, and a general description of cognitive processes involved in transmission of religious concepts.. More recently, he has written on the concept of Folk economics, which proposes that evolved cognitive biases play an important role in how laypeople view the economy.  Religion Explained  Of his books, Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought, is the best known. Boyer introduced cognitive anthropology, which provided a new understanding of religion. Religion for Boyer consists of cultural representations, that is, ideas that appear in roughly similar forms in the minds of different individuals in a group. To explain how religion emerges and is transmitted, we must explain how these ideas are acquired, stored and transmitted better than other possible ideas. Findings from cognitive and developmental psychology suggest that some combinations of ideas are particularly easy to acquire and remember. Among these, we find many standard themes of supernatural and religious imagination, such as the notion of an agent with counter-intuitive physics and a standard psychology, e.g. ghosts and gods that are not material but have the same mental capacities as humans. According to Boyer, there are only a few such combinations of intuitive and counter-intuitive material that are optimal for acquisition and memory - and these happen to be the most frequent ones in the world's religions. In this cognitive paradigm belief in supernatural agents is natural and part of human cognition. However, religion is not \\"special\\". That is, there are no specific mental systems that create religious ideas. Rather, these ideas are an expected by-product of mental systems that evolved for other reasons, not for religion. For instance, we easily entertain the notion of a \\"god\\" or \\"ghost\\" because of our intuitive psychology, what psychologists sometimes call \\"Theory of Mind\\". Justin L. Barrett has argued that Boyer‚Äôs book, The Naturalness of Religious Ideas: A Cognitive Theory of Religion is an attempt to reform traditional models and allow understanding religion in terms of cognitive science. Boyer dismantles many traditional assumptions of cultural studies. However, Barrett claims, Boyer lacks clarity--mostly due to the shift in anthropological to psychological jargon.  Minds Make Societies  In this book, Boyer explains the relevance of evolutionary psychology and cultural evolution to understanding human societies, from the small-scale communities in which humans evolved to modern mass-societies. The blurb states that the book \\"integrates insights from evolutionary biology, genetics, psychology, economics, and more to explore the development and workings of human societies\\". In Boyer's view, this new integrated social science can provide new answers, based on scientific evidence, to important questions about society. Each of the six chapters in the book focuses on one of these questions: (1) Why do humans favor their own group?, (2) Why do people communicate so much wrong information (rumors, superstition, etc.)?, (3) Why are there religions?, (4) What is the natural family?, (5) How can societies be just? and (6) Can human minds understand human societies? One running theme in the book is that social sciences can progress if they abandon \\"chimerical\\" notions like \\"nature\\" and \\"culture\\", that do not correspond to anything in the world. Social scientists should also abandon classical assumptions that name problems instead of solving them, like the idea that power is similar to a force, or that social norms exist outside the heads of human beings. Boyer recommends the kind of \\"consilient\\" social science outlined by EO Wilson, and argues that we already have the elements of such a social science, as illustrated in his book.

Egyptian:Piemro) was a city of ancient Egypt, on the Canopic branch of the Nile river, and 72 km (45 mi) southeast of the open sea and Alexandria. It was the first and, for much of its early history, the only permanent Greek colony in Egypt; it was a symbiotic nexus for the interchange of Greek and Egyptian art and culture. The modern villages of Kom Gi‚Äôeif, el- Nibeira and el-Niqrash cover the archaeological site, which has become a find of the highest significance and the source of not only many beautiful objects of art now gracing the museums of the world but also an important source of some of the earliest Greek writing in existence, from the inscriptions on its pottery. The sister port of Naucratis was the harbour town of Thonis/Heracleion, which was undiscovered until 2000. Background Archaeological evidence suggests that the history of the ancient Greeks in Egypt dates back at least to Mycenaean times (1600‚Äì1100 BC) and more likely even further back into the proto-Greek Minoan age. This history is strictly one of commerce as no permanent Greek settlements have been found of these cultures to date. After the collapse of Mycenaean Greek civilization and the ensuing Greek dark ages (c. 1100‚Äì750 BC), a \\"renaissance\\" of Greek culture flourished in the 7th century BC‚Äîwith it came renewed contact with the East and its two great river civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile. Map indicating location of Naucratis‚Äîthe Nile delta has shifted since ancient days; the city was situated directly on the Canopic (westernmost) branch. The first report of Greeks in 7th century BC Egypt is a story in the Histories of Herodotus of Ionian and Carian pirates forced by storm to land on or near the Nile Delta. It relates the plight of the Saite Pharaoh Psammetichus I (Psamtik) (c. 664‚Äì610) of the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt overthrown and in desperation seeking the advice of the Oracle of Leto at Buto, who cryptically advises him to enlist the aid of the \\"bronze men\\" who would \\"come from the sea.\\" Inspired upon seeing the bronze armor of the shipwrecked pirates, he offers them rewards in return for their aid in his campaign of return to power. Upon the success of this endeavor, he makes good on his word and bestows on the mercenaries two parcels of land (or \\"camps,\\" ) on either side of the Pelusian branch of the Nile. At present these sites remain uncertain but this may be a reference to the city of Daphnae. History =Literary= In 570 BC, the Pharaoh Apries (Wahibre, reigned 589‚Äì570 BC) led the descendants of this mercenary army made up of 30,000 Carians and Ionians against a former general turned rebel by the name of Amasis. Although fighting valiantly they suffered defeat and Amasis II became Pharaoh (reigned 570‚Äì526 BC). Amasis shut down the \\"camps\\" and moved the Greek soldiers to Memphis where they were employed \\"to guard him against the native Egyptians.\\" Herodotus: \\"Amasis was partial to the Greeks, and among other favors which he granted them, gave to such as liked to settle in Egypt the city of Naucratis for their residence.\\" Notice that he says \\"gave the city (),\\" which seems to indicate the existence (now borne out by archaeological evidence) of a \\"city\\" already there. This older city, settlement more likely, was no doubt small and inhabited by a mix of native Egyptians, Greeks and possibly even Phoenicians. Thus it seems the city was turned over to the Greeks, \\"chartered,\\" in the years immediately following 570 BC. The earlier date of c. 625 BC put forward by archaeologists may be the actual establishment of a settlement at the site. Amasis indeed converted Naucratis into a major treaty-port and commercial link with the west. This was done most likely as a means to contain the Greeks and concentrate their activities in one place under his control. It became not the colony of any particular city-state but an emporion (trading post) Naukratis: a city and trading port in Egypt, British Museum similar to Al Mina, the largest market port of north Syria. According to Herodotus the walled shrine known as the Hellenion was a co-operative enterprise financed by nine eastern Greek cities: *Four Ionian: Chios, Klazomenai, Teos and Phocaea *Four Dorian: Rhodes, Halicarnassus, Knidos and Phaselis *One Aeolian: Mytilene **Miletus, Samos and Aegina had their own separate sanctuaries. Thus the natives of at least twelve Greek city-states worked in a collaboration that was not only rare but proved to be lasting. Naucratis later became an important center of Greek culture under the Roman Empire, producing several celebrated orators of the Second Sophistic in the second and early third centuries AD. The third century writer Athenaeus came from Naucratis. =Archaeological= The site was discovered by Flinders Petrie who dug there in 1884‚Äì1885. He was followed by Ernest Arthur Gardner and finally David George Hogarth, in 1899 and 1903. Petrie's sketch plan of Naucratis The archaeological focus fell into two areas of northern and southern quarters. Found farthest south was a large Egyptian storehouse or treasury (A on sketch at right‚Äîoriginally identified by Petrie as the \\"great temenos\\") and just north of that a Greek mud-brick Temple of Aphrodite roughly 14 m √ó 8 m (curiously not mentioned in Herodotus' list.) Directly east of this temple was unearthed a small factory for faience scarab seals. In the northern section were found several temple ruins (E: Temple of Hera, F: Temple of Apollo & G: Temple of Dioscuri) including what may be Herodotus' Hellenion discovered by Hogarth in 1899 (directly east of F). \\"None of the votive pottery found here need have arrived earlier than the reign of Amasis, so it may well be that the Hellenion was founded as the result of his reorganization of the status of Naucratis, while the independent sanctuaries ... are of the earlier years of the town.\\" More recently American archaeologists W. Coulson and A. Leonard founded \\"The Naucratis Project\\" in 1977 carrying out surveys in 1977‚Äì1978 and further surveys and excavations to the south of the site from 1980‚Äì1982 (under the auspices of the American Research Center in Egypt). Unfortunately they found the original northern sanctuary section submerged under a lake formed by the risen water table and roughly 15 m deep. This part of the site remains under water today, making further work there difficult if not impossible. Their assessment of the approach taken and methods used by their predecessors was less than complimentary. \\"Unfortunately, much of the emphasis of the early excavators was placed on these religious structures at the expense of the commercial and domestic quarters. Consequently our knowledge of the mercantile character of ancient Naukratis‚Äîthe very facet of its early history that made it so exceptional‚Äîhas suffered greatly. Furthermore, the later historical sequences, such as the Hellenistic and Roman periods, were almost totally neglected.\\" Also discouraging to them was the destruction wrought by the local populace on the site. \\"Already in Petrie's day about a third of the half-mile by quarter- mile site of Naukratis had been dug away by the local farmers for use as high- phosphate fertilizer (sebakh) in their fields.... In the intervening 100 years or so, the sebakhin have totally destroyed this eastern portion of the site.\\" The barrier of the high water table made it impossible for them to find anything older than the Ptolmaic era. They agreed with Hogarth that the \\"great temenos\\" of Petrie was actually an Egyptian building and that indeed the entire south section of the town appeared to be non-Greek. Overall most of the finds were vases (some whole, most fragmentary) used as votives in the temples, but also stone statuettes and scarab seals. These are scattered to museums and collections around the world, the earlier material largely brought to Britain (mostly in the British Museum) and the latter to the Graeco-Roman Museum in Alexandria. Impact The Egyptians supplied the Greeks with mostly grain but also linen and papyrus while the Greeks bartered mostly silver but also timber, olive oil and wine. Naukratis, and the associated Greek \\"forts\\" in the general delta area, as demonstrated by accounts given above, became a ready source of mercenary fighting men for the Saite pharaohs, men with superior hoplite armor and tactics, also possessing invaluable naval expertise. Naucratis soon became a profound source of inspiration to the Greeks by re-exposing them to the wonders of Egyptian architecture and sculpture lost to them since the Bronze Age. Egyptian artifacts soon began their flow along the Greek trade routes finding their way into the homes and workshops of the Ionian Greek world and, via Aegina, the city-states of mainland Greece. Although Greek art and ideas in turn came back the other way their absorption into a largely xenophobic Egyptian culture was strictly minimal. Although Herodotus claimed that geometry () was first known in Egypt and then passed into Greece, it is now generally accepted by scholars that what the Greeks learned were more like \\"surveying techniques\\" and hardly deserve the designation \\"geometry\\" in the sense of a purely intellectual mathematical practice. Indeed, Greeks like Thales were already accomplished geometricians before their travel to Egypt and very likely Herodotus assumed that because the Egyptian was older, the Greeks must have got it from there. In terms of our modern understanding of the Greeks, and in particular the early use of their nascent Greek alphabet, the finds of Naucratis have turned out to be foundational. \\"The inscriptions on the pottery have yielded what Mr. Ernest Gardner considers‚Äîapparently on firm grounds‚Äîto be the oldest Ionic inscriptions, as well as some in the Korinthian, Melian, and Lesbian alphabets.\\" Of particular interest are the several examples of an evolutionary variation from the original Phoenician alphabetic script. Much has also been learned by comparing these alphabets with the forms they assumed a century later, forms that were destined to become universal across the Hellenic world. Naucratis was not only the first Greek settlement in Egypt but also Egypt's most important harbor in antiquity until the rise of Alexandria and the shifting of the Nile led to its decline. Nevertheless, the ancient city of Heracleion/Thonis also rivalled Naucratis as an important port city of Egypt, especially from the 6th to the 4th century BC. Herodotus Terracotta head Herodotus wrote that the prostitutes of Naucratis were \\"peculiarly alluring\\" and relates the story of Charaxus, brother of the poet Sappho, who traveled to Naucratis to purchase (for a \\"vast sum\\") the freedom of one Rhodopis, a bewitchingly beautiful Thracian slave and courtesan. After obtaining her freedom, she set up a brothel, built up a thriving business and amassed a small fortune. As a measure of thanks, she commissioned an expensive votive offering to the gods, eventually placed at Delphi, which could be seen in the historian's day.

For some of these species, it is especially vital in late winter, as it produces green shoots earlier than other grasses. The seeds are heavily consumed by many rodents and birds, notably mourning doves. This tough grass is known for its ability to reseed and establish itself on sites damaged by fire or overgrazing. Much germination occurs in years with wet Aprils. It is grown in xeriscapes‚Äîcultivars are available‚Äîand will become quite large if given sufficient space. The open, spangled appearance when in flower or fruit is very attractive, especially in backlight. The flower stalk is commonly used in dry flower arrangements. Uses In the past, the grass was a staple food of Native Americans, especially when the maize crop failed, and for non-agricultural tribes. Seed of the ricegrass was gathered and ground into meal or flour and made into bread. Since 2000, the ricegrass has been cultivated in Montana and marketed under the trade name Montina as a gluten-free grain. The Zuni people used the ground seeds as a staple before the availability of corn.Stevenson, Matilda Coxe 1915 Ethnobotany of the Zuni Indians.

Founded in 1864 as the state's first publicly funded normal school, the first class graduated from the Western State Normal School in 1866. The school merged into the University of Maine System in 1968 to become \\"the University of Maine at Farmington\\". Many early graduates attended the school for its liberal arts offerings alone. Among these were the Stanley brothers, famous for building the Stanley Steamer automobile, and John Frank Stevens, engineer of the Panama Canal. Comedian Bob Marley graduated with a degree in community health. Interest in the liberal arts continued unabated, and the college offered its first degree programs in the liberal arts in 1971. By the 1974‚Äì75 school year, nearly 300 students were enrolled in liberal arts majors. In early 2016, the University of Maine at Farmington Education Center was named in honor of its longtime President Theodora J. Kalikow who served from 1994 to 2012. Now named the Theodora J.

Early life He was born at Nansladron at St Ewe near St Austell in Cornwall, and was an only child. His father was Edward Martin (born in 1843), the owner of Martin Brothers China Clay Merchants in St Austell, who lived at Treverbyn, and who also owned the Lee Moor porcelain factory in Plympton. Martin Brothers, founded in 1837, became part of English China Clays. His mother was Elizabeth Emily Birch (born in 1851 in Manchester), who had also been married previously to Walter Braithwaite who died, and she came from Salford, and her family were wealthy chalk and lime merchants; her father was William Singleton Birch, who had founded Singleton Birch, later run by his uncle Thomas Birch. His parents had married on 26 April 1877 at Lillington, Warwickshire; he was baptised on 20 May 1878 at Lillington church.Warwickshire Baptism Index 1538‚Äì1900 He grew up in Knightsbridge. In 1891 he went to Eton College. In 1897 he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was an enthusiast member of the Oxford University Bicycle Club, then joined the Bath Road Club. In 1900 he went to Marcon's Hall, also known as Charsley's Hall, run by Charles Abdy Marcon. He graduated with a BA in 1902. Career Through the Bath Road Club (BRC) he met Montague Napier, and in 1903 went into partnership with Napier to sell cars. In 1909 after not paying a fine, he was banned from driving for two years at Guildford. He appealed at the High Court in January 1910, but the appeal was not upheld. For the next two years he rode bicycles, gaining the fastest record from Edinburgh to York in 1911. =Aston Martin= He first completed Aston Hill on 4 April 1914 During his driving ban he had become friends with another cyclist in the Bath Road Club, Robert Bamford. In 1912 they began to sell cars together. They co-founded Bamford and Martin Limited, at Henniker Mews in Kensington. Martin participated in competitions of the Motor Cycling Club, including those from London to Edinburgh. Their first advert was in the Bath Road News. Their first prototype was registered in March 1915. To provide an evocative name for the car, the pair remembered their races at Aston Hill, and called the car the Aston-Martin; the AM radiator badge went onto their cars. It was through the money from the Singleton Birch family minerals company Martin had the funds to expand his business.Singleton Birch In November 1925, Bamford and Martin Ltd went into receivership, and Martin was no longer a director of the company. At this time, Martin was working for Singleton Birch. After 1925,he never owned an Aston Martin car. Personal life In 1909, Martin married Christine Murray (born 1888) of Auchendinny in Midlothian; Christine died in April 1913, shortly after the birth of their son (born 19 March 1913). Martin then married Katherine King (born 14 July 1888) on 25 January 1917 in Kensington. In the 1920s he lived in Pembroke Villas in Kensington. In his later years he was a diabetic. Due to petrol rationing in the war, he returned to travelling on his bicycle; on 14 October 1945 he was knocked off at a set of traffic lights on Gloucester Road near his home, dying aged 67 in Kingston County Hospital on 21 October 1945. He had lived from 1932 at Palings Cottage on Warboys Road at Kingston Hill, in the Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe. His funeral was at 3pm on Monday 29 October 1945 at St. John the Baptist in Kingston Vale. He was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery.

He is widely credited with pioneering the more aggressive, acerbic and attention-grabbing form of the genre, which has since been adopted by generations of sports media personalities, and bringing it to a multinational listening audience.DolganPlutoTaaffeTucker Early life and career Franklin was born September 22, 1927 in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts.Dolgan His first broadcasting job was for Armed Forces Radio,Dolgan and his first radio station job was in 1952 in Oakdale, Louisiana. \\"I worked 70 hours a week, and my main job was to get to the station early and kill the snakes with a baseball bat,\\" he said of his Louisiana assignments. \\"They came out of the swamp to the heat of the generator. And I read the farm news. The glamour of show business.\\"Pluto He later worked at radio stations in North Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey, California and Texas, often as a disc jockey. He worked as operations director for WOIO in Canton, Ohio, before moving to WERE (1300 AM) in Cleveland in 1967 to host a sports talk show from 7 to 11 PM, after which he hosted a multi- subject talk show from midnight until 5 AM.Dolgan WWWE in Cleveland The zenith of Franklin's career came when he hosted Sportsline on 50,000-watt Cleveland AM station WWWE (\\"3WE\\") 1100-AM (eventually renamed WTAM) from 1972 to 1987. Arguably the most popular host on the station, he was popular for his extensive knowledge, outspoken opinions, gruff demeanor and rude banter with callers. Among his trademarks were playing the sound of a flushing toilet as he cut off callers he considered offensive, playing funeral music when the Indians were hopelessly out of contention for the season in question (thus giving them a \\"proper burial\\", usually in midsummer given their poor play at that time), his winner and the loser of the day preceded by appropriate introductory music for each, and boasting that his station's nighttime signal could be heard \\"over 38 states and half of Canada\\" (a claim still stated on air by WTAM talk-show hosts to this day).DolganPlutoTaaffe His caustic personality was a primary reason why \\"3WE\\" lost its status as the flagship station of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers in 1981 when he feuded with team owner Ted Stepien. Franklin and Cavaliers' radio voice Joe Tait openly questioned Stepien's ability to operate the team after multiple poor trades and unwise free agent signings leading to a depletion of talent. He went so far as to refer to Stepien again and again by his initials, \\"T.S.\\", which Franklin said stood for \\"Too Stupid.\\" Stepien retaliated by canceling WWWE's radio contract and firing Tait.DolganPlutoTaaffe Franklin popularized several regular callers by giving them nicknames like \\"The Swami\\", \\"The Prosecutor\\", and \\"Mr. Know-It-All.\\" The latter eventually became Franklin's full-time replacement, and today his show is known as the \\"Mike Trivisonno Show\\". Later career In August 1987, Franklin announced he had been hired by upstart all-sports station WFAN in New York City to be its afternoon host starting the following month. His initial contract with the station was for two years and $600,000.New York Times, 1987 But his act wore thin in the Big Apple, where critics and callers alike disliked his condescending style.Dolgan New York Times columnist George Vecsey wrote that Franklin was a \\"so-called big name ... whose specialty was hurling insults at fans who knew vastly more than he did.\\"Vecsey After much controversy and dismal ratings, he resigned in July 1989 two months before the end of his contract, and was replaced by the Mike and the Mad Dog program.Dolgan He returned to Cleveland and \\"3WE\\" immediately afterward.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics and Texas Rangers. He is currently a minor league coach in the Los Angeles Dodgers system. High school, college years Melhuse attended Lincoln High School in Stockton, California and was a student and a letterman in basketball and baseball. He played college baseball as a UCLA Bruin. In 1991, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 1992 to play for the Brewster Whitecaps. Major League Baseball career Previously, Melhuse played with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics, and Texas Rangers. He throws right-handed and is a switch-hitter. =Colorado Rockies= Melhuse collected his first career hit on August 24, , in the 12th inning of an unusual game between the Rockies and Atlanta Braves. Out of pitchers, Rockies manager, Buddy Bell, asked injured catcher, Brent Mayne, who was unable to swing a bat due to a sprained left wrist, if he could pitch. Mayne pitched the 12th inning and held the Braves scoreless. The following inning, with two outs and the bases loaded, Melhuse, pinch hitting for Mayne, singled over the shortstop's head to win the game. =Oakland Athletics= On January 5, 2007 Melhuse signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics. =Texas Rangers= On June 9, , Melhuse was traded by the Athletics to the Texas Rangers for cash. Adam's career as a Texas Ranger was short-lived. The Rangers traded for Jarrod Saltalamacchia (a catcher) on July 31, 2007, which lessened Melhuse's playing time. Melhuse was designated for assignment on August 23, 2007, and would later be released. =Oakland Athletics again= He re-signed with the Athletics for his second stint in 2007 on September 1 when rosters were expanded. Despite being on the Athletics for a second go-around in September, Melhuse sat on the bench the whole time and did not get into a game. He declared free agency on October 8, 2007, though not before being outrighted to the minors on October 5. =Texas Rangers again= on January 11, Melhuse signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. He made the team out of spring training as a backup to starting catcher Gerald Laird, but injured his hand in a game against the Detroit Tigers on April 24, resulting in his release. =Colorado Rockies again= In late June 2008, Melhuse signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies and was called up on August 14, 2008. On August 30, 2008, Melhuse was called up to the Rockies from the Triple-A Sky Sox to replace Yorvit Torrealba who was placed on the DL. =Texas Rangers again= Melhuse signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers in January . However, he was released on April 4. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On May 8, 2009, he signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. =Retirement= On June 17, 2009 Melhuse announced his retirement. =Post-playing career= Melhuse spent four seasons as an advance scout for the Chicago Cubs and two seasons in the Los Angeles Angels system as manager of the Burlington Bees.

Summary Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's cognitive inference systems, comparable to pareidolia and perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena resulting from face perception processes within the human brain. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, cognitive science, linguistics, evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and information processing. Religion Explained frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent cognitive neuroscience research in the modularity of mind. This theory involves cognitive \\"modules\\" (\\"devices\\" or \\"subroutines\\") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in \\"supernatural agents\\" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from agent detection: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. \\"When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is.\\"Boyer 2001:144, Boyer cites the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard's classic Zande story about a termite-infested roof collapsing. > For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the > Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande > were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. > But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, > when particular people were gathered in the house.Boyer, 2001:196, cf. > 2001:12. Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a \\"parasite\\" (or \\"spandrel\\") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the reading process is parasitic upon language modules. > As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires > mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or > not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of > supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so > on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other > mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make > sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. > This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and > learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these > activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all > sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to > attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind > adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various > capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion > that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that > there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing > religious thoughts.Boyer, 2001:311. Boyer admits his explanation of religion > is not a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, > either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to > explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is > the result of aggregate relevance ‚Äì that is, of successful activation of a > whole variety of mental systems.Boyer 2001:298, italics in original. Reception Critical reception of Religion Explained has been mixed. The psychologist Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi called the book \\"a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion.\\"Book Review: Religion Explained Human Nature Review 2002 Volume 2: 308‚Äì309 (22 July) He continues: > The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. > Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one > form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study > \\"spirituality\\" or teach \\"religion and science\\". This all serves to make us > forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer > indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand > tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the > spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it > has been done intuitively by all of us. The journalist David Klinghoffer wrote in National Review that \\"Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic\\" and describes his work as \\"professorial noodlings\\" that attempt to raise the question whether \\"all religions are somehow the same\\". He further claims that \\"debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures).\\"Faith no more‚ÄîReligion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought‚ÄîReview Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society, described Boyer's book as: > a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an > anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account > the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and > as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this > diversity.

Author and economist Zachary Karabell found stylistic faults. \\"Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable.\\" He concludes, \\"Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing.\\"Zachary Karabell.

Released by Paramount Pictures on December 25, 1952, the film is the sixth of the seven Road to ‚Ä¶ movies. It was the only entry in the series filmed in Technicolorhttp://sheldontimeshall.com/films-on-tv-at-christmas- part-1-1957-1966/ and was the first to feature surprise cameo appearances from other well-known stars of the day. Plot George (Bing Crosby) and Harold (Bob Hope), American song-and-dance men performing in Melbourne, Australia, leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in Darwin, where they take jobs as deep sea divers for a prince. They are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to Bali, Indonesia. They vie for the favors of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lala (Dorothy Lamour), a cousin of the Prince (Murvyn Vye). A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the Prince plans to claim as his own. After escaping from the Prince and his henchmen, the three are shipwrecked and washed up on another island. Lala is now in love with both of the boys and can't decide which to choose. However, once the natives find them, she learns that in their society, a woman may take multiple husbands, and declares she will marry them both. While the boys are prepared for the ceremony, both thinking the other man lost, plans are changed. She's being unwillingly wed to the already much-married King (Leon Askin), while the boys end up married to each other. Displeased with the arrangement, a volcano god initiates a massive eruption. After fleeing, the three end up on yet another beach where Lala chooses George over Harold. An undaunted Harold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience to stick around to see what's going to happen next. Cast * Bing Crosby as George Cochran * Bob Hope as Harold Gridley * Dorothy Lamour as Princess Lala McTavish * Murvyn Vye as Prince Ken Arok * Peter Coe as Gung * Ralph Moody as Bhoma Da * Leon Askin as King Ramayana * Carolyn Jones as Eunice * Michael Ansara as Guard * Harry Cording as Verna's father =Cameo appearances= Among the celebrities who made token \\"gag\\" appearances in this film are bandleader Bob Crosby (Bing's brother), Humphrey Bogart, by way of a clip from The African Queen, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, and Jane Russell, as her character from the film Son of Paleface (1952). The cameo by Martin and Lewis was part of a 'comedy trade' whereby they made an appearance in this movie while Hope and Crosby appeared in Martin and Lewis's Scared Stiff the following year. Martin and Lewis also made films for Paramount at the time. Production =Development= Bing Crosby and Bob Hope Road to Bali was the first Road to... picture since Road to Rio (1947), and was known during production as The Road to Hollywood. It was the sixth film in the series, the next to last, as well as the final Road film in which Dorothy Lamour's role would be the female lead. Nine years later, The Road to Hong Kong instead featured Joan Collins, with a cameo by Lamour. Filming started on April 21, 1952 and continued until July of the same year. Road to Bali was a co-production of Bing Crosby Enterprises, Hope Enterprises and Paramount.TCM Notes =Filming= The giant squid that threatens Bob Hope in an underwater scene was previously seen attacking Ray Milland in the Paramount production Reap the Wild Wind (1942), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The erupting volcano climax was taken directly from the Paramount production Aloma of the South Seas (1941), also starring Lamour. =Writing= Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour In keeping with the film's initial setting of Melbourne, Australia, many of the jokes contain references to Argyle socks, Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, Tasmanian-born Errol Flynn, and a dance routine featuring Scottish bagpipes. As with the other Road movies, Bob Hope breaks the \\"fourth wall\\" several times to make side comments to the audience. For example, as the music for a song sung by Bing Crosby begins, Hope looks to the camera and says, \\"He's gonna sing, folks. Now's the time to go out and get the popcorn.\\" Crosby breaks the fourth wall after Hope \\"notices\\" the audience is paying attention when he's about to tell Crosby how he escaped from the giant squid. Hope and Crosby walk away from the camera and Hope tells his story in exaggerated pantomime (out of earshot). Crosby then walks back toward the audience and shrugs at the camera, indicating Hope's description was indecipherable. =Sets= Hope Enterprises owned one-third of the film and Bob Hope wrote about this in his book This Is on Me. \\"There are other pleasant things about owning part of a picture. In the Road to Bali there was a beach scene for which tons of beautiful white sand had been trucked in from Pebble Beach. I had just put in a one-hole golf course at my house on Moorpark Street in North Hollywood. I had four sand traps standing empty, with nothing in them in which my friends could leave their hoof prints. When I saw that sand a light switched on in my head. ‚ÄúWe own two-thirds of this sand, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Bing said. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like some of it for my course at home.‚Äù When he said, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I called the prop man and said, ‚ÄúTake ten truck-loads of this sand out to my house when we‚Äôre done with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo dice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is Paramount‚Äôs sand.‚Äù Bing and I had another talk with the boys in the front office. As a result, part of the Road to Bali is in my back yard. Reception Paramount hired the Bijou Theatre in New York City on November 14, 1952 to preview the film to exhibitors and critics. Hope was not happy that Paramount only spent $150,000 promoting the film compared to the $300-$400,000 he expected. The film opened in the United States on December 25, 1952 and opened in fourth position at the box-office. The New York premiere of the film took place at the Astor Theatre on January 29, 1953. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times was very enthusiastic in his review of January 30, 1953: \\"it is apparent that this veteran and camera-scarred team is the neatest, smoothest combo of comics now working the fun side of the screen. Apart, they may be very funny or clever or quaint or what you will, according to where you are sitting and what sort of picture they‚Äôre in. But together, and in a 'Road' picture, with the consequent freedom of style and reckless impulse that goes with it, they are pretty nigh nonpareil. At least, that's the word of this reviewer who spent a small part of yesterday falling out of a seat at the Astor while desperately clutching his sides. The reason? Quite simply, Road to Bali is a whoopingly hilarious film, full of pure crazy situations and deliciously discourteous gags, all played with evident relish and split-second timing by the team.\\" Variety was more cautious having seen a preview and their comments may have resulted in the removal of a couple of scenes: \\"Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour are back again in another of Paramount‚Äôs highway sagas, this time in Technicolor, with nonsensical amusement its only destination. That end is reached eventually, but the road isn‚Äôt a smooth highway and the entertainment occasionally falters. Overall, however, it serves its intended purpose satisfactorily and the grossing prospects are okay...Hal Walker‚Äôs direction is geared to the free-wheeling spirit that dominates the script and does well by it, as do the three stars and the featured cast.\\" An extended choreographed version of \\"The Road to Bali\\" song which was cut from the final print has surfaced in recent years and Paramount chief Adolph Zukor revealed in his autobiography that an expensive water ballet sequence was cut from the film too. Soundtrack The music for all songs was written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke. Van Heusen's birth name was Edward Chester Babcock. For the final Road picture, The Road to Hong Kong, Hope's character was called Chester Babcock. When Decca Records was recording the songs from the movie, they did not use Dorothy Lamour. Peggy Lee recorded the Lamour vocals. * \\"Chicago Style\\" by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope * \\"Moonflowers\\" by Dorothy Lamour * \\"Hoots Mon\\" by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope * \\"To See You Is to Love You\\" by Bing CrosbyCrosby's version of \\"To See You Is to Love You\\" is featured without credit in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). * \\"The Merry-Go-Run-Around\\" by Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour and Bing Crosby * \\"The Road To Bali\\" by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope (recorded commercially, but only used in the opening credits as sung by a chorus). Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Peggy Lee recorded all of the songs for Decca Records and these were issued on a 10\\" LP. Crosby's songs were also included in the Bing's Hollywood series. Legacy Road to Bali was parodied in 1953 in the animated short Alley to Bali, with Woody Woodpecker and Buzz Buzzard in the Hope and Crosby roles. The cartoon was released by Universal Studios, which currently owns the first four Road to... films. =Copyright status= The film was copyrighted under registration LP2200 1 January 1953. That registration entry also shows \\"in notice: 1952\\", meaning that is the year in the copyright notice on the film. The copyright was renewed under RE105899 dated 1 September 1981.Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain (1950-1959), page 287. However, according to copyright law, when the \\"in notice\\" year is earlier than the calendar year of the official registration, the copyright term begins in the earlier year (1952 in this case).Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain (1940-1949), page viii. Therefore, for films registered for copyright in 1950 and later, the window for a valid renewal was the 28th calendar year of the original copyright term.Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain (1950-1959), page 509. For Road to Bali, the 28th year was 1980, which means the film had already fallen into the public domain when the copyright was renewed in 1981. Home media Columbia Pictures Television (in joint venture with LBS Communications through what was then Colex Enterprises) once had the television rights to this film in the 1980s, along with other Bob Hope movies from the 1940s and 1950s. This is evident in a home video release from the mid-1990s, where a CPT logo can be seen at the beginning and end of the film. Because the film is in the public domain, there have been at least a dozen DVD releases from a variety of companies over the years. However, Fremantle now holds ancillary rights to this film (as the successor in interest to LBS Communications), and official video releases have been issued under license from Fremantle, with DVD and HD-DVD releases coming from BCI Eclipse. A Blu-Ray was released on July 5, 2017 by the Kino International.

She is portrayed by Canadian actress and model Tricia Helfer. Of the twelve known Cylon models, she is the sixth of the \\"Significant Seven\\". Like the others of the \\"Significant Seven\\", there are several versions of her, including Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey, Gina Inviere, Natalie Faust, Lida, and Sonja. She is the only model that does not use one particular human alias for all copies.Although two of the Number Eights have been individuated by different military callsigns, and the marriage of one of them, they began with the same alias, Sharon Valerii. The character was named after Number Six, Patrick McGoohan's character from the show The Prisoner.Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion Appearance and personality traits Six is a seductive, statuesque Cylon infiltrator. She was the first example shown of a new generation of Cylons capable of adapting to human form and emotions. Little else is known of her earlier years. She can, like other Cylons, retain memories which can be downloaded into another body if the original body is killed. Like her counterparts, her body was designed to mimic the human body at the cellular level, making her almost undetectable to testing procedures, and there are many copies of her in existence. Sixes and Eights are the Humanoid Cylon models shown most frequently. Sixes tend to have individualistic traits and are considerably susceptible to the full array of human emotions. Although extremely effective and adaptive, Sixes always show a certain disdain for their given chores and dislike being treated as expendable. Most versions of Six have platinum-blonde hair, including Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey and Sonja. Others such as Gina Inviere, Natalie Faust and Lida have honey-blonde hair, and one Six with black hair has been observed. It was stated by Caprica showrunner Kevin Murphy that had the prequel series Caprica continued, it would be revealed that the Sixes' default personality was modeled after that of Zoe Graystone.Kevin Murphy in The Caprica Times Exclusive Interview: Kevin Murphy 2011-04-21 Music Since her debut in the mini-series, a leitmotif has been used in scenes featuring Tricia Helfer as Six. This simple 9-note motif was composed by Richard Gibbs. The 9/8 figure is divided unevenly into a group of 3 notes, followed by 3 groups of 2. It is almost always performed on a gamelan, and also plays over the introduction to each episode of the series. On the published series soundtrack, the melody is listed as The Sense of Six. Versions Copies of Number Six appear regularly, mostly within Cylon society. Several notable versions have had more prominent roles: =Caprica Six= At the beginning of the miniseries, a Six copyThe name of this copy is never given. While the novelization of the miniseries gives her name as Natasi, the book is not considered canon. No name was ever given by the producers. Ronald D. Moore stated in a special podcast that the idea is that Baltar simply never bothered to learn her name, which is supported by David Eick . is involved in an intense affair with Dr. Gaius Baltar. Pretending to be an employee of a computer corporation, Six seduces Baltar while helping him with his work on the Colonial Defense System. After infiltrating the mainframe, Six reveals her true nature to Baltar. Just a few hours before the intended Cylon attack, she informs him that the Cylons will use the computer access code that he has given her to infiltrate the highest levels of Colonial defence systems; thereby disabling the Colonial military, and attacking the Twelve Colonies. That same day, the Cylons launch their multi-targeted attack and destroy most of humanity. Six uses her body to shield Baltar from a nuclear blast during the attack, saving his life and sacrificing hers. In the episode \\"Downloaded\\", this Six copy is downloaded into a new body. Nicknamed \\"Caprica Six\\" by fellow Cylons, she is viewed as a hero within the Cylon civilization for her complete success in her mission to compromise the colonies' defences. She is surprised to discover she has 'emotions' and expresses a degree of regret at her actions, as evidenced by her constant visions of Baltar. This \\"Head Baltar\\" acts as a critical counsellor and manipulator to her in the same way Head Six does for the real Baltar. Caprica Six is enlisted to motivate the resurrected Galactica copy of Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii to move out of her apartment and reintegrate into Cylon society. However, in defiance of their superiors, both Caprica Six and Sharon opt instead to aid Samuel Anders, to the extent that Caprica Six murders a Three to save him. Allowed by the Caprica Cavil, Caprica Six and Sharon then begin preaching peace with the humans as the way of God. This leads them to take over Cylon culture and to resume the hunt for humanity, leading them to the colony of New Caprica, which they take over in a bloodless coup facilitated by Baltar, who surrenders to Caprica Six as soon as the Cylons arrive. After the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, Caprica Six alienates the other Cylons with her desire for peaceful coexistence with humans. Her reunion with the real Baltar, however, shatters her illusions about her former pawn, as Baltar impotently allows the Cylons to bully him into enacting their oppressive tyranny upon New Caprica. The other Cylons insist Baltar must sign an execution order for 200 insurgents in response to two suicide bombings by the human resistance movement. Baltar initially refuses and Caprica Six alone objects strongly to her fellow Cylons' desire for mortal retribution. These objections resulted in her being shot in the head by fellow Cylon, Aaron Doral. Her death and an immediate threat to shoot Baltar force him to sign the order. Caprica Six is reborn and helps Baltar escape onto a Cylon Basestar when New Caprica is ultimately abandoned by its population. After settling on the basestar, Caprica Six becomes involved in a m√©nage √† trois with Baltar and Biers and explicitly states she loves both of them. She was also instrumental in rescuing an inexplicably sick Hera from the Basestar. She assists in Athena's download and witnesses the obvious bond between Athena and Hera. Caprica subsequently disables and then kills Boomer who threatens to throttle Hera despite Athena's anguished pleas. She leads Athena and her child to a captured Raptor and returns with them to Galactica, where she is promptly imprisoned. In this situation, she is frequently used as a source of information about and means of understanding the Cylon's motivations. Colonel Saul Tigh begins to make more frequent stops to her cell, questioning her about what it's like to exist as a Cylon. He confronts her about being responsible for the deaths of billions and whether she feels any remorse or if she can just 'flip a switch' and shut out the pain. Caprica Six questions Tigh's reasons for the line of questioning, unaware Tigh is one of the Five Unrevealed Cylon Models. When she goads him about needing to feel pain, he turns to leave but she assaults him and bludgeons him. To her surprise, he cries and begs for more pain, but in response, she abruptly aborts her assault, shakes her head and replies he doesn't need any more pain. She then kisses him passionately. Dr. Cottle later reveals Caprica Six is pregnant. It is revealed Tigh is the father of the baby. After it is revealed Tigh is one of the 'Final Five' Cylons, Caprica Six's relationship with Tigh changes. The significance of her pregnancy increases as the child will not be a human-Cylon hybrid but will be a pure Cylon offspring. Caprica Six begins to live with Tigh in his quarters on Galactica and the two now share a very intimate and caring relationship. However, when Ellen Tigh returns, she, Tigh and Caprica Six fight about whom Tigh really loves, and Caprica Six loses the baby. She joins the rescue mission for Hera and is finally proud of Baltar, something she had always wanted and feels was the one thing missing between the two of them. They both see Head Six and Head Baltar and are shocked the other sees them. The two defend Galactica against Cylon boarders and take Hera when they find her wandering alone. Caprica Six holds a gun on Cavil during the standoff over Hera and hands him the phone when the deal is made. Later, on Earth, she and Baltar are visited one last time by Head Six and Head Baltar, who explain their destiny was to protect Hera and while God's plan is never over, their lives will be much less eventful. Caprica Six and Baltar then go off to start new lives as farmers together. Ronald D. Moore has stated that Baltar never bothered to learn her name. In the season finale, there's a flashback scene on Caprica in which Gaius tells her \\"he has forgotten her name.\\" The non-canon novelization of the miniseries by Jeffrey A. Carver suggests Caprica Six went by the name Natasi. =Head/Inner/Messenger Six= A distinct copy derived from Caprica Six residing in Baltar's head since the destruction of the colonies, \\"Head Six\\" appears as a figment of his imagination, invisible to everyone else. She suggests this phenomenon might be caused by either a computer chip implant or insanity over his guilt. When Baltar undergoes an MRI-like \\"brain scan\\", it reveals no sign of a computer chip or any other foreign object in his brain. While this briefly leads Baltar to think he has truly gone insane, he concludes this is impossible, given Six's knowledge of events unknown to him (for example, the prediction of the birth of the Human/Cylon Hybrid to Sharon Agathon while a prisoner aboard Galactica). Confronted with this in Part II of \\"Home\\", Six declares that she is neither a computer chip nor a hallucination produced by mental instability. When Baltar then asks just who or what she is, she simply replies she is \\"an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you and to love you.\\" She repeats this claim in the episode \\"Torn\\". This Six often appears suddenly, without warning. She often advises and gives instructions to Baltar. While she usually appears to him as part of the real world, occasionally he interacts with her in an imagined but persistent dream-like setting within his mind. While Six can physically interact with Baltar in his imagination, it is for most of the series unclear if she is able to physically affect him in the real world ‚Äî this is finally resolved in the episode \\"Escape Velocity\\", where Head Six is shown lifting Baltar from the floor to a standing position after he endured repeated blows from a Galactica marine. This manifestation of Six in particular is extremely religious. In contrast to the colonists, and like the other Cylons, she believes in a singular god, whom she identifies as Love. She constantly attempts to convince Baltar to believe in the Cylon god, and to accept his part in God's plan or will. Her motivations are unclear. While some of her advice appears to benefit humanity, for example, pointing out a Cylon device to Baltar on Galactica and helping him build a Cylon detector, it more often serves only Baltar's needs, and she expresses enjoyment over what she considers the inevitable extinction of the human race, constantly saying humanity is naturally violent and would have destroyed itself without the Cylons' intervention. Head Six appears to be somehow related to Caprica Six, which is the Six model who seduced Baltar on the planet Caprica and encouraged him to give her access to the Colonial Defense mainframe. This belief is supported by the fact that Caprica Six has her own Head Baltar, implying some sort of transcendental connection between those two specific characters. Nonetheless, once the audience is re-introduced to Caprica Six, it becomes clear that something more unusual is going on since Caprica Six and Baltar bear little resemblance in personality to their internal counterparts. Head Six is seen less frequently following the departure from New Caprica. In her brief appearances in the first part of season 4, Baltar begins to refer to her as an angel. In the final episode of the series, it is made clear that, like the Starbuck Avatar, Head Six is indeed an agent of a higher power as she claims, not a chip or a delusion inside Baltar's head. She and Head Baltar are the last-seen characters in the final moment of the episode, which takes place 150,000 years after the rest of the series. Their role as angel-like beings was to guide Baltar and Caprica Six in protecting Hera, and once that task is done, they leave them alone. She and Head Baltar speculate on whether the cycle will continue (recalling the theme of \\"all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again\\"); Head Six reveals that her excitement over humanity's potential extinction was a ruse and states her belief that the cycle has finally been broken. Although the name is not used by characters in the context of the story, Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore revealed in his official SciFi BSG podcasts \\"Head Six\\" is the designation given to the character in scripts and production documents. In discussions of the final episode, Moore also calls this version Inner Six who, along with Inner Baltar, are \\"... messenger(s) of a higher power\\",Ronald D. Moore in Battlestar Galactica: The Last Frakkin' Special reinforcing the variations \\"Head Six\\", \\"Inner Six\\" and \\"Messenger Six\\" (or Head/Inner/Messenger Baltar) used by fans to describe these characters. Although in Season 2 Episode 6 \\"Home\\" Gaius Baltar refers to Head Six as \\"Sara\\" when in the holding cell designed for Sharon Valerii earlier in the season. Whether this was an unauthorized ad-lib by the actor or perhaps it was what he calls her is unclear as she is never referred to by name again closed caption text during episode http://forums.syfy.com/index.php?app=core&module;=attach&section;=attach&attach;_rel_module=post&attach;_id=9439 =Shelly Godfrey= In the episode \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\", a copy of Number Six in the fleet using the name \\"Shelly Godfrey\\" appears. Godfrey attempts to frame Baltar for betraying the human race with supposed photographic evidence. In addition, she attempts to seduce Commander Adama. She disappears abruptly after her \\"photographic evidence\\" is proven to be fake. This leads the people of the fleet to conclude she was a Cylon agent trying to discredit Dr Baltar because of his Cylon detector research. Baltar's popularity increases as a result. Felix Gaeta notes that once the photo was resolved, identifying it as a fake was almost too easy, \\"like she wanted to be found out.\\" As her appearance coincided with the temporary disappearance of Head Six, it is often wondered (and indeed voiced by Baltar himself) whether she was a physical manifestation of Head Six posing in a dual identity. The episode does cause the audience (and Baltar) to think Shelly Godfrey is related to Head Six, however this is demonstrated to be a deliberate red herring in subsequent episodes of Battlestar Galactica. The telemovie Battlestar Galactica: The Plan reveals that Godfrey is indeed an actual Six. After the photo was discovered to be fake, the Number One onboard Galactica who was coordinating Cylon efforts made her enter an airlock and be killed so she could download and give Galactica's coordinates to the Cylon fleet. Another Six donned a wig and clothing identical to Godfrey's in order to confuse the guards and allow Godfrey to get away from them. In the hallway, Cavil intimates that Godfrey has failed to produce convincing fake evidence because she is attracted to Baltar, and her statement that Baltar is \\"a brilliant man\\" who helped them so much on Caprica supports this, despite her protestation that Cavil should have seen her with him because \\"I was brutal with him. I pushed him.\\" Later, on Cavil's bed, the other Six also notes her sister's complete destruction of the Sixes' cover and her utter failure to discredit Baltar and \\"his dreamy hair\\". =Gina Inviere= Gina, as she appears in Razor In the episode \\"Pegasus\\" and the telemovie Battlestar Galactica: Razor, it is revealed a copy of Six had hidden aboard the Pegasus, posing as a civilian network administrator and using the name Gina Inviere (supposedly Old Gemenese for \\"resurrection\\"; in reality, √Ænviere is Romanian for \\"resurrection\\".Resurrection - Definitions from Dictionary.com) This Number Six gains the confidence of Rear Admiral Helena Cain, with whom she has a romantic relationship, and then-Lieutenant Kendra Shaw, who gives Gina the administrator codes for the Pegasus mainframe. Gina uses Shaw's password in order to disable the Pegasus during a Cylon attack, enabling the ship to be boarded by centurions. Shaw sees another Six with the centurions thereby exposing Gina as a Cylon. Gina manages to get her hands on a gun, but hesitates to shoot Cain, indicating that Gina's relationship with Cain was not an act. Gina's hesitation enables Shaw to knock her unconscious before Gina can make a decision. Cain orders her former lover's imprisonment, condemning her as a thing, and allows Gina to be subjected to torture and gang rape by members of the Pegasus crew. By the time of the events of \\"Pegasus\\", Gina appears to be catatonic from the severe trauma of her abuse. In \\"Pegasus\\", Baltar treats Gina's injuries and transfers his love of Caprica Six to her, causing Gina to finally start responding. In the two-part episode \\"Resurrection Ship,\\" Gina comes out of her catatonic state completely and is so traumatized from her ordeal that she wishes to truly die. To this end, Gina supplies Baltar with vital intelligence on the Cylon Resurrection Ship so that the fleet can destroy it. Once the Resurrection Ship has been destroyed, Gina kills her guard and begs Baltar to kill her. Instead, Baltar releases Gina to seek justice for her torment. Gina corners her former lover, Admiral Cain, in her quarters and kills her in revenge before escaping from the Pegasus. She then joins a group of Cylon sympathizers, who want humanity to make peace with the Cylons. The extensive sexual abuse she has suffered renders Gina psychologically unable to be intimate with Baltar until shortly before her death. In the finale of the second season, Gina detonates a nuclear weapon she had received from Dr Baltar, killing herself, signalling the location of the human settlement to the Cylons, and destroying the Cloud 9 and several other ships in the human fleet. While the destruction of the Resurrection Ship in Resurrection Ship Part 2 initially indicates Gina's death to be final, The Plan reveals that there was another Resurrection Ship in range shortly before Gina's death as stated by the fleet's copy of John Cavil. However, Gina does not appear to have been downloaded with the Cylons only finding New Caprica by way of detecting the signature of her nuclear detonation a year later. Presumably, this second Resurrection Ship was out of range as the Cylons had chosen to stop chasing the fleet at the time due to the efforts of Boomer and Caprica Six. Gina has honey-blonde hair, actress Tricia Helfer's natural hair colour, instead of the platinum-blonde of most Sixes. Like Shelly Godfrey, she sometimes wears glasses. Series creator Ron Moore says in the DVD commentary for \\"Pegasus\\", the name \\"Gina\\" is directly meant as a jab against critics of the reimagined series who use the derogatory term \\"GINO\\" (Galactica In Name Only) to describe it. Gina appears briefly in one of Boomer's flashbacks in The Plan. Gina helped prep Boomer for her upcoming transition to a sleeper agent and provided IT support for her cover identity. =Natalie Faust= Natalie An assertive and authoritative version of Number Six named Natalie appears in the episode \\"Six of One\\". Following a vote to lobotomize Cylon raiders in which a single copy of Number Eight (Boomer) gave the swing vote in favour of lobotomy by siding against the rest of her model, Natalie, along with the remaining Number Sixes, Eights and Twos, leads a coup against the other models. They decide to give sentience to the Cylon Centurions, making them self-aware and capable of feeling for the first time. The other models, led by Cavil, are dumbstruck by this decision and attempt to destroy Natalie and her followers permanently in the episode titled \\"The Ties That Bind\\", luring them into an ambush by pretending to acquiesce to their demands that they stop lobotomizing the Raiders, unbox the entire Number Three model, and use the knowledge gained by the Three known as D'Anna at the Temple of Five to identify and join with the lost \\"Final Five\\" humanoid Cylon models. The Resurrection Ship is jumped out of range during this ambush so that the deaths suffered by the rebels are permanent. A Number Two from their damaged Baseship, Leoben Conoy, takes a Heavy Raider and manages to make contact with Lieutenant Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace and her crew on the Demetrius, a sewage processing vessel repurposed for long-range exploration in the episode \\"The Road Less Traveled\\". Conoy offers an alliance between the rebel Cylons and the Colonials. In the episode \\"Faith\\", Conoy, Thrace and some of the Demetrius crew take a Colonial Raptor to the rebel Basestar and make repairs, allowing the Baseship ‚Äì the Demetrius following behind ‚Äì to jump to the Colonial fleet in the episode \\"Guess What's Coming to Dinner\\", in which Natalie makes a deal with Rear Admiral Adama on the Galactica to reveal the location of the main Cylon Resurrection Hub and help the Colonials destroy it, ending resurrection for the enemy Cylons, as long as she can bring the \\"Final Five\\" with her off the Galactica after Earth is located. And so a tenuous alliance is formed. Natalie is on her way to speak to Adama again when she encounters the human- Cylon hybrid infant Hera Agathon in the corridor and bends down to talk to her. Natalie is then confronted and shot by Hera's mother Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon, the Number Eight who left the Cylons, married Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon and joined Galacticas crew, because of a dream Athena had in which a Number Six took her daughter. Somehow the rebel Basestar's hybrid detects her shooting and panics, causing the ship to jump away. Near the beginning of the episode \\"Sine Qua Non\\", Natalie is taken to the Galactica infirmary for treatment where she dies of her injuries. As Natalie dies, she projects a forest scene, a favourite projection of Number Six model. Doctor Cottle also holds Natalie's hand as she dies in an act of kindness for the mortally wounded woman. With no Resurrection Ship in range, her death is permanent. Her surname is not used onscreen and her first name is only used once, by a Number Eight in the episode \\"The Hub\\", who notes that the Hybrid of their Baseship has reacted to Natalie being killed or injured on Galactica. Nor is her backstory elaborated on. Michael Angeli's original version of the script for the episode \\"Six of One\\" has John Cavil refer to Natalie Faust by her full name and mention that she infiltrated Gemenon posing as a political reform advocate. During the Cylon attack, she was responsible for relaying the coordinates of all the Gemenese leaders.Original script for \\"Six of One\\" by Michael Angeli =Sonja= A copy named Sonja who has been elected to represent the Cylons in the Quorum. Sonja has taken over Natalie's place as the leader of the rebel faction of cyclons. Sonja's appearance is that of a typical Six. In her first act as the cyclon leader, she requests that Roslin and Adama hand over Boomer in order to try her for treason against the Cylons. She is later seen at a meeting of the new Quorum of Ships' Captains, representing the rebel Basestar, as they discuss the impending transfer of Admiral William Adama's command from the ageing Galactica to the Basestar. Before the operation to rescue Hera, Sonja and Ellen Tigh are seen discussing the whereabouts of The Colony the place they knew Boomer was going to take Hera to. Sonja revealed that Number One, John Cavil had moved The Colony from its original location 5 months prior shortly before the Cylon civil war took place. And in the series finale, she is seen along with a two and an eight discussing their plan with Adama on how to populate the new Earth saying that they'll stay alongside the humans in their new home until their own deaths come. =\\"Tough Six\\"= A brunette Six with blonde streaks appears in Battlestar Galactica: The Plan. She had been a prostitute on the Colonies, and eventually drunkenly mocks John Cavil's schemes while sharing a bed with him, following the not-quite-fatal shooting of Commander Adama by Cylon sleeper agent Boomer and the suicide of their fellow infiltrator Simon O'Neill, a Number Four. She points out that most of the Cylons' failings, including those mentioned above, along with Number Two Leoben Conoy's interaction with Lieutenant Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace and Shelly Godfrey's failure to ruin Gaius Baltar, have been due to love, and leaves the room telling Cavil that \\"you can't declare war on love\\". She typically wears chains-and-leather clothing and has been seen to chew bubblegum during a Cylon meeting in Cavil's chapel, sitting next to Godfrey, who has platinum hair and wears glasses and a sensible blouse and skirt. Cavil notes that the Sixes have done a good job of distinguishing themselves and praises Godfrey for it, in contrast to the Number Five/Aaron Doral copy who has individuated himself from the copy abandoned on Ragnar only by wearing a teal suit instead of a burgundy one, in the same cut. This Six, not given a name onscreen but referred to as \\"Tough Six\\" in the shooting script, was instrumental in the mysterious disappearance of Ms Shelly Godfrey from Galactica, using a wig and a change of clothes to imitate Godfrey's appearance and confuse the marines who were tailing her, making them think that Godfrey had gotten further ahead of them when the real Godfrey was pulled into another corridor by John Cavil. Godfrey and Cavil then slipped away and Cavil airlocked Godfrey, while the marines were chasing Tough Six, who evaded them. The ultimate fate of Tough Six is unknown, whether she was captured and executed or remained in the fleet until New Caprica, as she is not seen in The Plan following her exit from Cavil's bedroom and did not appear in regular episodes. =Other versions= Number Sixes have been shown in a variety of roles, including repairing the Galactica (\\"Deadlock\\" and \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\"), hospital administration (\\"The Farm\\"), serving as Heavy Raider pilots, and as rebel Cylon leaders (Natalie and Sonja). Other versions include: *A copy in a red tunic, who arrives aboard the Armistice Station and seduces the Colonial representative (otherwise known as Boxey's father) shortly before the station is destroyed. Similar copies are part of the group that board Ragnar Anchorage to rescue and debrief Aaron Doral. *A copy, wearing a white overcoat, who captures and kisses Helo before being shot by Sharon Agathon. Another white coat-wearing Six observes their escape, and another (possibly one of these two) later leads Centurion troops in pursuit of them. In \\"Razor\\", a copy in a white coat is the one seen and shot by Kendra Shaw during a Cylon boarding raid on the Pegasus. In \\"The Plan\\", another white coat wearing copy appears to be overseeing the Centurions pinning down the Colonial forces during the events of \\"Lay Down Your Burdens.\\" This copy communicates the Cylon-Colonial truce to the Caprica copy of John Cavil who agrees to let the human fleet know despite his model voting against it. *A copy of Six in a black suit, who acts as \\"overseer\\" to the breeding experiment concerning Helo and Sharon Agathon. This copy or a similar one is killed by Starbuck in the Delphi Museum while retrieving the Arrow of Apollo. The copy of number Eight that would eventually become known as Sharon Agathon warned that she would soon download into a new body and lead the Cylons to their position. A copy of this type is also killed by Starbuck while escaping the Cylon farm *Copies, clad in gold tunics, who act as \\"nurses\\" or \\"midwives\\", helping Caprica Six and Boomer through their respective resurrections. *Two copies that take part in a meeting aboard Colonial One on New Caprica, and agree with the proposal to execute over 200 human detainees. They vote on behalf of the majority of the Number Six model (Caprica Six dissents). *A raven-haired copy, dying from a disease aboard a basestar, whom Baltar strangles after she hysterically accuses him of deliberately leading them to the disease-carrying beacon (perhaps in an effort to get him to kill her). *Copies from the infected basestar that are brought aboard Galactica. Along with the other captured infected Cylons, they are suffocated by Helo before the Galactica enters Cylon resurrection range to prevent the Colonials from committing genocide. *A copy from \\"Faith\\" aboard the damaged Basestar. She recognizes crew-member Jean Barolay as a resistance fighter from New Caprica who gagged her, threw her into a septic tank and watched her drown, an event that has left her emotionally traumatized. After Barolay tells her she'd be happy to do it again, the copy attacks and kills her. Shortly afterwards she is shot and killed by another Six copy, Natalie who does it to give the Colonials \\"justice\\" since there is no Resurrection Ship in range. *A copy named Lida, with long brown hair, who comforts Gaius Baltar in Blood on the Scales. *Multiple Sixes are seen as pilots of Cylon Heavy Raiders working alongside Galactica pilots in Faith and Someone to Watch Over Me. They use \\"Six\\" as their de facto surname.Starbuck refers to one of her pilots as \\"Six\\" (not \\"a Six\\" or \\"this Six\\"), and Helo addresses one as \\"Six\\". *The \\"Cylon Prototype\\" voiced by Helfer in the last episode of Blood and Chrome. Casting Tricia Helfer was cast after a strong audition, despite some initial concerns over her lack of acting experience. Director Michael Rymer explains: > \\"It wasn't just the way she looked; she just has this vibe about her.

The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes) or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. As applied, those definitions may or may not align. The word act can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as variety shows, television programs, music hall performances, cabaret, and literature.  Acts and scenes  An act is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax, and resolution. A scene normally represents actions happening in one place at one time, and is marked off from the next scene by a curtain, a black-out, or a brief emptying of the stage. To be more specific, the elements that create the plot of a play and divide it into acts include the exposition, which gives information, setting up the rest of the story. Another element is the inciting incident, which starts all the action that will follow. Going along with the inciting incident, the major dramatic question is formed, which holds the rest of the play. The majority of the play is made up of complications, which change the action. These complications lead to the crisis, which is the final plot point. At this point, the major dramatic question has usually been answered. Finally, there is \\"the resolution, also known as the denouement\\", which is the end of the play, where everything comes together and the situation has been resolved, leaving the audience satisfied with the play as a whole. These more specific elements of plot are the main things used to divide a play into acts and sometimes scenes. Though there is no limit to the number of acts in a dramatic work, some may have been derived from different interpretations of Aristotle's Poetics, in which he stresses the primacy of plot over character and \\"an orderly arrangement of parts\\" and others may have been derived from Freytag's analysis.  History  Roman theatre was the first to divide plays into a number of acts separated by intervals. Acts may be further divided into scenes. In classical theater, each regrouping between entrances and exits of actors is a scene, while later use describes a change of setting. Modern plays often have only one level of structure, which can be referred to as either scenes or acts at the whim of the writer, and some writers dispense with firm divisions entirely. Successive scenes are normally separated from each other in either time or place, but the division between acts is more to do with the overall dramatic structure of the piece. The end of an act often coincides with one or more characters making an important decision or having an important decision to make, a decision which has a profound impact on the story being told. Contemporary theatre, in line with screenwriting and novel forms, tends towards a three-act structure. Many operettas and most musicals are divided into just two acts, so, in practice, the intermission is seen as dividing them, and the word \\"act\\" comes to be used for the two-halves of a show whether or not the script divides it into acts.  Varieties  = One- act plays = A one-act play is a short drama that consists of only one act; the phrase is not used to describe a full-length play that does not utilize act-divisions. Unlike other plays which usually are published one play per book, one-act plays are often published in anthologies or collections. = Three-act plays = In a three-act play, each act usually has a different mood. In the most commonly used structure, the first act has a lot of introductory elements (that is, who, what, when, where, why, and how); the second act is usually the darkest, with the antagonists having a greater compass; and the third act has a resolution (d√©nouement), often with the protagonists prevailing. * Act one: The conflict of the story is discovered. The exposition, the introduction of the protagonist and other characters that the protagonist meets, take place,Cannell, S. J. (n.d.). What is the three-act structure? [Lecture transcript]. as well as the dramatic premise and inciting incident (the incident that sets the events of the story in motion) occurs approximately halfway through the first act. * Act two: The main character encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This is known as the complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point, seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective, and seems to have no way to succeed. * Act three: The climax occurs as well as the resolution (d√©nouement), a brief period of calm at the end of a play where a state of equilibrium returns. = Five-act plays = Until the 18th century, most plays were divided into five acts. The work of William Shakespeare, for example, generally adheres to a five-act structure. This format is known as the five-act play, and was famously analyzed by Gustav Freytag in Die Technik des Dramas (Dramatic techniques). The five acts played specific functions in the overall structure of the play, but in performance, there was not necessarily any clear separation between them. A similar five- part structure is also used in traditional Japanese Noh drama, particularly by Zeami Motokiyo. Zeami, in his work \\"Sand≈ç\\" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five dan) Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (jo), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (ha), with the greatest climax in the third dan, and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth dan (ky≈´).  Other media  As part of a television program, each individual act can be separated by commercials. In film, a number of scenes grouped together bring an audiovisual work to life. The three-act structure is commonly referred to in film adaptations of theatrical plays.

Before Thorndon was Thorndon it was Haukawakawa and in 1824 Pipitea P√• was settled at its southern end. More recently Pipitea Marae and the land under the Government Centre have been separated from Thorndon and the name Pipitea returned to them in 2003.

He was also head of the Bloom Township Republican Party from 1978 to 1992. He was born in 1930 in the \\"Hungry Hill\\" section of Chicago Heights, a south suburb, which was the home to mainly Italian immigrants in a heavily Italian town. His parents operated \\"Three Star Restaurant\\", a popular hangout for many neighborhood residents.  Political career  Panici began his political career in the early 1970s as President of the Chicago Heights Park District. In 1975, he put together a coalition ticket and easily defeated the incumbent mayor. His Concerned Citizens ticket won three of the four seats on the city council. In 1979, Panici won again, with his entire city council slate of John Gliottoni, Louise Marshall and Eugene Sadus winning re-election. They were joined by Nicholas C. \\"Nick\\" LoBue, and all five won easy victories in 1983 and 1987. His administration was responsible for bringing Lake Michigan water to Chicago Heights after residents had complained for years about poor water quality. Several municipal buildings were also built during his tenure, including a new City Hall, police station and library. Beginning in 1978, Panici was the Bloom Township Republican Committeeman. With a patronage army that spanned all levels of city and township government. During Panici's time as Bloom Township's Republican leader, it consistently turned out one of the highest Republican vote totals in the Chicago suburbs. This made the Bloom GOP one of the most powerful political organizations in Illinois. The party backed winning candidates in every city, park district, school district and township race during the 1980s. Panici was also responsible for fostering the political careers of numerous local officials, state legislators and judges during that time. He was instrumental in the campaigns of Governor Jim Thompson. The party became so powerful that Bloom Township High School hosted President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush in 1988. Panici even forged alliances with Democrats, and was partly responsible for bringing former Cook County Democratic chairman Edward Vrdolyak to the county's Republican party. Panici also organized a crossover vote in 1992 to defeat former congressman Gus Savage in the Democratic primary. Panici co-founded Telecommunication Services (TCS) with two other Chicago Heights entrepreneurs, and the company grew rapidly during the 1980s and early 1990s, serving many of the area's hospitals and other businesses.  FBI investigation  In 1988, south suburban mob boss Albert Tocco of Chicago Heights was indicted for a wide range of crimes, including racketeering, murder, extortion, and arson. He was also implicated by his wife in the murder of Anthony Spilotro, which was depicted in the movie Casino. Although he was never charged with the Spilotro killing, he would be convicted on many other charges in 1990 and sentenced to 200 years in prison. During the trial, LoBue's name was mentioned along with another Panici ally, former South Chicago Heights mayor Donald Prisco. Testimony alleged that LoBue and Prisco were accepting bribe money from Tocco in exchange for their help in keeping the garbage-hauling license for both cities in the hands of Tocco's Chicago Heights Disposal. This led federal investigators to open a wide-ranging probe of public corruption in Chicago Heights. City Street Department superintendent Ernest Molyneaux pleaded guilty to bribery-related charges in 1990 and cooperated with the investigation, leading to the indictments of LoBue and Prisco later that year. The two were charged with multiple racketeering violations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The investigation also led to the indictments of several other city officials on charges of bribery, tax evasion and other crimes. Under this cloud of controversy, Panici chose not to seek re-election as mayor in 1991. His hand-picked successor, Douglas Troiani, won an easy victory against Sadus, who had split with the party. In March 1992, two weeks after the death of his wife, Panici was indicted along with Gliottoni and Marshall on federal charges of racketeering, extortion and bribery.Rosalind Rossi, Chicago Heights ex-mayor and two others indicted, Chicago Sun-Times, March 26, 1992 He was also charged separately with witness tampering for directing a witness to lie to investigators. The indictment charged that the group extorted more than $700,000 from businesses in return for city contracts. Panici stepped down from his post as township Republican committeeman after the indictment. LoBue and Prisco each pleaded guilty to lesser crimes and agreed to testify against the others. LoBue would tell a federal jury that nearly every major city contractor paid kickbacks to city council members. He claimed that Panici was responsible for orchestrating the schemes. LoBue testified that Panici decided how much bribe money would be required to secure each contract, and who would receive the payoffs. One of these schemes involved monthly payments from Tocco to LoBue and Panici. Prisco and lifelong Panici friend Ralph Galderio, a former city employee, also testified that Panici was involved in bribery and received significantly reduced sentences in return for their testimony. Panici was accused of personally taking nearly $260,000 in bribes during his 16 years as mayor. Panici, Gliottoni and Marshall were convicted in 1993 on all charges. Panici was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Gliottoni to five years, six months and Marshall to four years. Over the next several years, other Panici allies would also head to prison. Bloom Township Supervisor Robert Grossi was sentenced to four years in prison in 1996 for misusing township funds, and former Chicago Heights Deputy Police Chief Sam Mangialardi would get a 10¬Ω year sentence for his 1995 conviction on charges that he accepted $10,000 monthly payments to protect the city's top drug dealer. Panici was not involved in either case.  After the fall  Panici was released in 2001, and returned to live in Chicago Heights. He has always maintained that LoBue, who admittedly had ties to organized crime, extorted city contractors without Panici's approval or knowledge. He published a book, \\"From Hero to Zero: How the Feds and a Mafia Wannabe Took a Good Man Down\\" in 2013 From Hero to Zero: How the Feds and a Mafia Wannabe Took a Good Man Down detailing his version of the events leading up to his trial and imprisonment In his later years, he remained active in local politics, advising several candidates successfully. Panici died in Chicago Heights on December 20, 2017 after a lengthy illness. References *Holli, Melvin and Peter A. Jones (1995). Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait.

The Cheesecake Factory also operates two bakery production facilities‚Äîin Calabasas, California, and Rocky Mount, North Carolina‚Äîand licenses two bakery-based menus for other food service operators under The Cheesecake Factory Bakery Cafe marque. Its cheesecakes and other baked goods can also be found in the cafes of many Barnes & Noble stores. David M. Overton, the company's founder, opened the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, in 1978. The restaurant established the future chain's pattern of featuring an eclectic menu, large portions, and signature cheesecakes. In 2020, Fortune magazine ranked The Cheesecake Factory at number 12 on their Fortune List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction. History =Founding and early years= The Cheesecake Factory was founded by Evelyn Overton. Evelyn first decided to open a business after making a cheesecake for her husband's employer in 1949. She opened a small cheesecake shop in Detroit, Michigan, in the late 1950s, but eventually gave it up in order to raise her two children. She continued to supply cakes to several local restaurants through a kitchen in her basement. In 1972, Oscar and Evelyn moved to the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles where they opened a wholesale bakery, in which they produced cheesecakes and other desserts for local restaurants. =California= In 1978, Evelyn's son David opened a small salad-and-sandwich restaurant in Beverly Hills that sold 10 varieties of cheesecakes on a one-page menu. In 1983, he opened a second restaurant in Marina del Rey. By 1987, the Beverly Hills location had expanded into a 78-seat restaurant and was experiencing great financial success. This led to the opening of a third, larger location in Redondo Beach, which was eventually renovated into a 300-seat, location. By the end of the 1980s, The Cheesecake Factory's one-page menu had expanded and the restaurant offered additional fast-food and short-order items. =Expansion beyond Southern California= The Cheesecake Factory at Palisades Center in West Nyack, New York The 1990s saw the opening of the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant outside of Southern California. The new restaurant was located in Washington, D.C. The Cheesecake Factory was incorporated in 1992 and went public in September 1993. David Overton planned to open 3-4 units a year in the hopes of generating 25% a year increase in sales. The company began changing its menu twice a year and added items including steaks, seafood, and vegetarian dishes. The company continued to open new restaurants and by 1995 was ranked 11th in the United States. As of April 2013, The Cheesecake Factory operated 162 restaurants under The Cheesecake Factory name in 36 states. Plaza Las Am√©ricas in San Juan, Puerto Rico, opened its first Cheesecake Factory on August 28, 2013. The company used to operate one self-service, limited-menu express food service operation under The Cheesecake Factory marque inside the DisneyQuest family entertainment center in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. =International expansion= The Cheesecake Factory in Hong Kong The Cheesecake Factory has expanded into international markets by both licensing agreements for other companies to operate franchises, and by corporate ownership. The first store outside the United States was opened at The Dubai Mall in August 2012 as a franchise via a licensing agreement. On January 25, 2011, the company expanded into the Middle East in a partnership with Kuwaiti retail franchising company M.H. Alshaya Co. The 300-seat restaurant opened on August 16, 2012 at The Dubai Mall. This is The Cheesecake Factory's first location outside the United States. In May 2014, The Cheesecake Factory announced that they would open the first Cheesecake Factory in East Asia. The first East Asian Cheesecake Factory opened in Disneytown in Pudong, Shanghai, China on June 16, 2016. As of May 2018, The Cheesecake Factory has ten restaurants in the Middle East: four in Dubai (Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates, Jumeirah Beach Residence and Dubai Festival City Mall), three in Kuwait (Arabella, Sidra, and Avenues Mall ‚Äî which was the 160th Cheesecake Factory opening), two in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh and Jeddah), and lastly one in the Yas Mall in Abu Dhabi. On December 1, 2015, The Cheesecake Factory opened its eighth Middle East branch at the Verdun Shopping Center in Beirut, Lebanon. The opening was attended by many of The Cheesecake Factory management including managers from the US and Dubai. The Cheesecake Factory also made its first appearance in Doha, Qatar, by opening in the Mall of Qatar and further opened two more branches in Villagio and Doha Festival City. There are Cheesecake Factories in Parque Delta and Centro Santa Fe, Mexico City. On April 12, 2017, the company announced that it would be expanding into Canada. In November 2017, the first Canadian location opened at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario. In May 2017, a Hong Kong store opened in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui. Other restaurants A Grand Lux Cafe Restaurant at Westfield Garden State Plaza, Paramus, New Jersey. The Cheesecake Factory Bakery Cafe operates two bakery production facilities in Calabasas Hills, California and Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and licenses two bakery-based menus to other food service operators. This division operates in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. =Grand Lux Cafe= David Overton designed the Grand Lux Cafe, an upscale restaurant for The Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas. The restaurant is modeled after Italian, French, and Austrian styles. The Cafe offers, in addition to American and European-style food, Thai, Malaysian, Caribbean cuisine, and others. The Cheesecake Factory operates fourteen Grand Lux Cafe restaurants located in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Each Grand Lux Cafe features an on-site bakery which produces a selection of signature bake-to-order desserts (which take up to 30 minutes), and a full-service craft bar. Most of the restaurants feature sumptuous fabrics and textures and polished marble floors and table tops. Hand-blown glass fixtures and intricate mosaics. The four most recent Grand Lux Cafe restaurants have moved in a new design direction, incorporating inlaid leather seating, warm wood paneling, colorful drum lamp shades and roaring fireplaces to create a cleaner modern look. =RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen= RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen is a contemporary Asian-fusion restaurant which opened on June 19, 2008, at Century City in Los Angeles. David Overton excluded Chinese and Japanese cuisines from the menu, as these are served at the Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory restaurants. A second location opened in Oakbrook, IL in November 2017, but this location closed in December 2019. =North Italia= On July 31, 2019, the Cheesecake Factory announced it had reached an agreement to buy Fox Restaurant Concepts for $308 million in cash at closing and another $45 million due over the course of the next four years. These concepts include North Italia, a specialty restaurant known for pasta, pizza, and other Italian foods. There are currently locations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. =Flower Child= Flower Child is the second concept from Fox Restaurant Concepts. There are currently locations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Menu The Cheesecake Factory's Miso Salmon In addition to cheesecake, the menu also offers starters and entrees, such as chicken, pasta, and burgers. =Caloric content= The Cheesecake Factory has been criticized for featuring large servings of high-calorie and high-fat foods, and a corresponding lack of healthy menu options. For these reasons, the chain was dubbed the \\"worst family restaurant in America\\" for 2010 by Men's Health magazine. The average sandwich at the restaurant contains 1,400 calories. In 2013, the Center for Science in the Public Interest gave a better understanding toward some of the food found at The Cheesecake Factory, including the \\"Crispy Chicken Costoletta\\" that has more calories (2,610) than a 12-piece bucket of fried chicken from KFC and The Cheesecake Factory's \\"Bistro Shrimp Pasta\\" dish, which had more calories than any other entr√©e from a national chain restaurant at 3,120 calories, with 89 grams of saturated fat. The United States Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion states in its dietary guidelines that a typical female adult should consume about 2,000 calories (males 2,500) and no more than 10% of saturated fat per day. In an attempt to offer healthier, lower-calorie meal options, The Cheesecake Factory created a \\"Skinnylicious\\" menu that features a variety of cocktails, salads, appetizers, and specialty dishes such as lemon-garlic shrimp and grilled salmon. Coronavirus pandemic On March 18, 2020, Overton informed his landlords that his restaurants will be unable to pay rent for the month of April due to significant financial losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but will resume paying rents as soon as possible.\\"The Cheesecake Factory Tells Landlords Across the Country It Won‚Äôt Be Able to Pay Rent on April 1\\" by Matthew Kang Eater Los Angeles March 25, 2020; retrieved March 28, 2020 Popular culture On The Big Bang Theory, Penny and Bernadette worked at The Cheesecake Factory before meeting their respective husbands Leonard and Howard.

The golden trout is normally found in the Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River), Volcano Creek (tributary to Golden Trout Creek), and the South Fork Kern River. It is the state freshwater fish of California. The California golden trout is closely related to two rainbow trout subspecies. The Little Kern golden trout (O. m. whitei), found in the Little Kern River basin, and the Kern River rainbow trout (O. m. gilberti), found in the Kern River system. Together, these three trout form what is sometimes referred to as the \\"golden trout complex\\".Inland Fishes of California, By Peter B. Moyle. Page 20. Golden trout from within the John Muir Wilderness. Golden trout caught in a high mountain lake of the Wind River Range. Taxonomy Originally the golden trout was described as a subspecies of the salmon species, with a name Salmo mykiss agua-bonita, and it is still often considered a subspecies (now called Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita) along with several other rainbow trout subspecies commonly known as redband trout. FishBase and the Catalog of Fishes however now (2014) list O. aguabonita as an independent species rather than as subspecies of O. mykiss.W. Eschmeyer (2014) aguabonita, Salmo mykiss Catalog of Fishes. California Academy of Sciences. (accessed 3 Nov 2014) Likewise, while ITIS lists O. m. whitei and O. m. gilberti as subspecies of O. mykiss, O. aguabonita instead is listed as a full species. Description The golden trout has golden flanks with red, horizontal bands along the lateral lines on each side and about 10 dark, vertical, oval marks (called \\"parr marks\\") on each side. Dorsal, lateral and anal fins have white leading edges. In their native habitat, adults range from long. Fish over are considered large. Golden trout that have been transplanted to lakes have been recorded up to . The golden trout should be distinguished from the similarly named golden rainbow trout, also known as the palomino trout. The golden rainbow is a color variant of the rainbow trout.S. Dobosz, K. Kohlmann, K. Goryczko, H. Kuzminski. \\"Growth and vitality in yellow forms of rainbow trout\\". Journal of Applied Ichthyology, Volume 16, Issue 3 pp. 117‚Äì120, June 2000 . The golden trout is commonly found at elevations from to above sea level, and is native to California's southern Sierra Nevada mountains. Outside of its native range in California, Golden trout are more often found in cirques and creeks in wilderness areas around 10,500‚Äì12,000\\"+, often beyond 12,500\\"+ passes that are not passable without crampons, ice axes, and ropes until after the Fourth of July. Their preferred water temperature is but they can tolerate temperatures in degraded streams on the Kern Plateau as high as so long as those waters cool during the night. The only other species of fish indigenous to the native range of California golden trout is the Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis). = Record catches = The Wyoming Game & Fish Department state record golden trout measured and weighed , caught in Cook Lake, Wyoming in 1948. The IGFA \\"All-Tackle Length Record\\" for O. m. aguabonita measured caught in Golden Lake, Wyoming in 2012.IGFA World Records  Distribution  O. m. aguabonita is native to the southern Sierra Nevada, including the upper reach and tributaries of the South Fork of the Kern River, and Golden Trout Creek and its tributaries. It has been introduced in hundreds of lakes and streams outside the native range, though most of these populations did not last or hybridized with cutthroat trout and other subspecies of rainbow trout. History In 1892 the California golden trout was originally described by David Starr Jordan, the first President of Stanford University, as Salmo mykiss agua-bonita. The fish was named after the Agua Bonita Waterfall where the first specimens were collected, at the mouth of Volcano Creek, at the creek's confluence with the Kern River. A century later they were listed as Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita in Behnke's Native trout of western North America. In 1904 Stewart Edward White communicated to his friend President Theodore Roosevelt, that overfishing could lead to extinction of the golden trout. In White's novel The Mountains, he wrote about the threatened golden trout on California's Kern Plateau. Roosevelt shared White's concern and, through U.S. Fish Commissioner George M. Bowers, dispatched biologist Barton Warren Evermann of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries to study the situation. In 1906 Evermann published The Golden Trout of the Southern High Sierras. Based on morphology, Evermann accurately described four forms of this native fish: Salmo roosevelti from Golden Trout (Volcano) Creek, Salmo aguabonita from nearby South Fork of the Kern River, Salmo whitei (named in recognition of Stewart Edward White) from the Little Kern River, and Salmo gilberti, the Kern River rainbow. Genetic studies have since clarified three groups of trout native to the Kern River: California golden trout (O. m. aguabonita) native to the South Fork Kern River and Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River mainstem but the historic course of the South Fork Kern River and now only separated from it by a lava flow and ridge of sediment), Little Kern River golden trout (O. m. whitei), and Kern River rainbow trout (O. m. gilberti). Conservation Years of overexploitation, mismanagement and competition with exotic species have brought golden trout to the brink of being designated as \\"threatened\\". Introduced brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) outcompete them for food, introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) prey on them and introduced rainbow trout (O. mykiss) hybridize with them, damaging the native gene pool through introgression. Populations have been in steady decline for decades. In 1978 the Golden Trout Wilderness was established within Inyo National Forest and Sequoia National Forest, protecting the upper watersheds of the Kern River and South Fork Kern River. In September 2004, the California Department of Fish and Game signed an agreement with federal agencies to work on restoring back- country habitat, heavily damaged by overgrazing from cattle and sheep, as part of a comprehensive conservation strategy. The US Endangered Species Act (USESA) designated the subspecies O. m. whitei as LT, or Listed Threatened, since 1978, under the name Oncorhynchus aguabonita whitei. =Subspecies designations= NatureServe has designated the following NatureServe Conservation Status for the three subspecies: * Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita‚ÄîGolden trout (G5T1): Critically Imperiled, last reviewed in 2013. The primary threat is hybridization and introgression with stocked rainbow trout. Other threats include competition with non-native brown trout and rainbow trout, predation by brown trout, habitat degradation from cattle grazing, and possibly expanding beaver populations in the native range. Genetic studies showed hybridization with stocked rainbow trout in almost all known wild populations analyzed to as of 2003. Non-hybridized populations are restricted to less than 1% of their native range, and confinement to these areas for long periods create a significant risk of inbreeding depression, and loss of heterozygosity and genetic variance. * Oncorhynchus mykiss gilberti‚ÄîKern River rainbow trout (G5T1Q): Critically Imperiled, with questionable taxonomy that may reduce conservation priority, last reviewed in 2005. Few if any genetically pure populations still exist. Primary threats include continued introgression with introduced rainbow trout, habitat loss from grazing, logging and road building, unpredictable events such as floods, drought, and fire (and subsequent landslides), and reduced habitat availability due to introduced beaver. * Oncorhynchus mykiss whitei‚ÄîLittle Kern golden trout (G5T2Q): Imperiled, with questionable taxonomy that may reduce conservation priority, last reviewed in 2005. Hybridization with introduced rainbow trout is considered a threat, and \\"there is a constant threat from introductions of other salmonids by disgruntled anglers.\\" The subspecies still occurs in the Little Kern River, above the falls on the lower river, though some populations show signs of introgression with coastal rainbow trout. The American Fisheries Society has designated all three subspecies as Threatened since August 2008. Translocations outside of endemic range For sportfishing, the California golden trout underwent many twentieth century translocations into multiple Western states and established populations survive in California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, Colorado, and Wyoming. Populations in the high-elevation lakes in the Ruby Mountains, Nevada, have died out. The current status in other states where the California golden trout were planted (Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon) lacks documentation. A self-sustaining introduced population also exists in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada; the province's golden trout population is managed by translocating fish between lakes to balance populations, but no new fish from other populations are introduced.https://www.ab- conservation.com/downloads/report_series/a-summary-of-sport-fish-communities- in-seven-high-mountain-lakes-in-southwestern-alberta.pdf Chuck Yeager and the New Mexico population When Colonel Chuck Yeager introduced one of his commanding officers, General Irving \\"Twig\\" Branch, to the Sierra Nevada populations of golden trout, Branch ordered Yeager and Bud Anderson to introduce the species to the mountain streams of New Mexico.Yeager, Chuck and Janos, Leo. Yeager: An Autobiography. Pages 348-351 (paperback). New York: Bantam Books, 1986. . However, the New Mexico populations have also died out. In his second autobiography, Press On, Yeager details his annual fishing trips to catch golden trout which he extols as one of the best game fish and best eating fish to be found.

Apache trout are a yellowish-gold color with a golden belly and have medium-sized dark spots that are evenly spaced and that may extend below the lateral line and onto the dorsal and tail fins. The top of its head and back are dark olive in color, and it has the appearance of having a black stripe/mask through each of its eyes, due to two small black dots on either side of the pupil. There can be a throat mark below the lower jaw, ranging in color from yellow to gold. Distribution The Apache trout is the state fish of Arizona, and is one of only two species of trout native to that state, with the other being the gila trout (O. g. gilae). It natively lives in clear, cool streams in the White Mountains that flow through coniferous forests and marshes, but has been introduced into several lakes in the area. The Apache trout is native to the upper Salt River watershed (Black and White rivers) and the upper Little Colorado River watershed. Apache trout have been introduced into isolated streams outside of their historic range in the Pinaleno Mountains and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Life history The Apache trout spawns from March to the middle of June, and varies with elevations. Maturity was found to occur in three years, and fecundity is based on the size of trout. One female typically produces from 72 to 240 eggs in fish and from 646 to 1,083 eggs in fish.Harper, K.C. 1978. Biology of a southwestern salmonid, Salmo apache (Miller 1972). pp. 99-111 in J.R. Morning, editor. Proceedings of the wild trout-catchable trout symposium. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Corvallis The eggs hatch after 30 days. The Apache trout eats both terrestrial and aquatic insects, such as Trichoptera and Diptera. In lakes, they also eat small fishes and zooplankton. Conservation Map showing Apache Trout occurrences in Arizona Recovery and management efforts for Apache trout have been ongoing since the 1940s. Apache trout are raised in federal and state hatcheries, and reared fish have been used to assist with recovery and to maintain populations for sport fishing in certain streams and reservoirs.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service While the IUCN considers the Apache trout to be critically endangered, it is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Around 100 years ago, they could be found in of streams in the White Mountains. By the late 1960s, their range had been reduced to around of these streams. Once the Endangered Species Act of 1969 was passed, they became one of the first species listed under it. When this act was replaced by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, they became one of the first fish species protected under the newer Act. Population numbers for this species are still rising. Today, the main risk to the Apache trout is its easy hybridization with the rainbow trout and major forest fires. Cutthroat trout are also genetically similar and cross-breed with Apache trout, compromising the genetic purity of each species. The range of the Apache trout remains limited, which puts it at risk, but it is now common enough that limited fishing is permitted. Many of the Mount Baldy headwater streams that are the stronghold of Apache trout are entirely closed to fishing. Catch and release fishing opportunities for wild (stream born), pure- strain Apache trout exist in a limited number of areas. Additionally, there are numerous consumptive fishing opportunities for Apache trout in waters where natural reproduction is not occurring and the Apache trout population is the result of stocking efforts.http://www.willjordanphoto.com/Fly- Fishing/Book/11181808_sWRJ8 References * Trinomial from Behnke, 2002.

The original Chinese Theatre was commissioned following the success of the nearby Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, which opened in 1922. Both are in Exotic Revival style architecture.\\"Chinese Thater\\", Los Angeles Conservancy Built by a partnership headed by Sid Grauman over 18 months starting in January 1926, the theater opened May 18, 1927, with the premiere of Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings. It has since been home to many premieres, including the 1977 launch of George Lucas' Star Wars, as well as birthday parties, corporate junkets, and three Academy Awards ceremonies. Among the theatre's most distinctive features are the concrete blocks set in the forecourt, which bear the signatures, footprints, and handprints of popular motion picture personalities from the 1920s to the present day. Originally named Grauman's Chinese Theatre, it was renamed Mann's Chinese Theatre in 1973; the name lasted until 2001, after which it reverted to its original name. On January 11, 2013, Chinese electronics manufacturer TCL Corporation purchased the facility's naming rights. In 2013, the Chinese Theatre partnered with IMAX Corporation to convert the house into a custom-designed IMAX theater. The newly renovated theater seats 932 people and features one of the largest movie screens in North America. History After his success with the Egyptian Theatre, Sid Grauman turned to Charles E. Toberman to secure a long-term lease from Francis X. Bushman on property at 6925 Hollywood Blvd., the site of Bushman's mansion. In appreciation, a plaque was installed on the front of the theater dedicating it to Bushman. Toberman contracted Meyer & Holler, designer of the Egyptian, to design a \\"palace-type theatre\\" of Chinese design. Grauman financed the theater's $2.1 million cost and owned a one-third interest in the Chinese Theatre; his partners‚ÄîMary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Howard Schenck‚Äîowned the remainder. The principal architect was Raymond M. Kennedy of Meyer & Holler. During construction, Grauman hired Jean Klossner to formulate an extremely hard concrete for the forecourt of the theater. Klossner later became known as \\"Mr. Footprint\\", performing the footprint ceremonies from 1927 through 1957. Many stories exist to explain the origins of the footprints. The theater's official account credits Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast of a radio adaptation of A Star Is Born, Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was \\"pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it.\\" Still another account by Klossner recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. (Note: In 1949, Klossner's story changed to say that Grauman had accidentally stepped into the wet concrete.) The theater's third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity after Talmadge to be immortalized in the concrete. In 1929, Grauman decided to retire and sell his share to William Fox's Fox Theatres chain. However, just a few months later, Howard Hughes convinced Grauman to return to the theater because he wanted Grauman to produce the world premiere of his aviation epic Hell's Angels, which would also feature one of Grauman's famous theatrical prologues before the film. Grauman remained as the theater's managing director for the entire run of Hell's Angels, retiring once again after its run finished. Unsatisfied with retirement, though, Grauman returned to the theater as managing director on Christmas Day 1931 and kept that position until his death in 1950. One of the highlights of the Chinese Theatre has always been its grandeur and d√©cor. In 1952, John Tartaglia, the artist of nearby Saint Sophia Cathedral, became the head interior decorator of the Chinese Theatre, as well as the theater chain then owned by Fox West Coast Theatres. He later continued the work of Klossner, by recommendation of J. Walter Bantau, for the Hollywood footprint ceremonies. Tartaglia performed his first ceremony as a Master Mason for Jean Simmons in 1953, for the premiere of The Robe, the first premiere in Cinemascope. Although replacing Klossner was initially thought to be a temporary job for Tartaglia, his dedication resulted in a 35-year career in which he last performed as the master mason/concrete artist in honor of Eddie Murphy in May 1987. Tartaglia was formally recognized by the City of Los Angeles in October 2011. The Chinese Theatre was declared a historic and cultural landmark in 1968, and has undergone various restoration projects in the years since then. Ted Mann, owner of the Mann Theatres chain and husband of actress Rhonda Fleming, purchased it in 1973. From then until 2001, it was known as Mann's Chinese Theatre. Mann Theatres grew to become the largest independent chain in the country before Mann sold the business, including the Chinese Theatre, to Gulf & Western in 1986. In 1988, Time Warner predecessor Warner Communications Inc. bought a 50% stake from Gulf & Western for $150 million. The theater chain was eventually sold to WestStar Holdings in 1997. In 2000, a partnership of Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures acquired the theater, along with the other Mann Theatres properties. In 2000, Behr Browers Architects, a firm previously engaged by Mann Theatres, prepared a restoration and modernization program for the structure. The program included a seismic upgrade, new state- of-the-art sound and projection, new vending kiosks, and exterior signage, and the addition of a larger concession area under the balcony. The program began in 2002 and restored the original name‚Äî\\"Grauman's Chinese Theatre\\"‚Äîto the cinema palace. As part of the upgrade, Behr Browers also designed a new Chinese-themed six-plex in the attached Hollywood and Highland mall that continued to operate under the name Mann's Chinese 6 Theatre. In 2007, the CIM Group purchased the land on which the theater sits for an undisclosed price from the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation of New York and Barlow Respiratory Hospital of Los Angeles. CIM Group also owns the Hollywood and Highland retail mall, as well as numerous other residential and commercial properties in Hollywood. On May 27, 2011, Chinese Theatres LLC, a partnership owned by producer Elie Samaha and Donald Kushner, purchased both Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the adjacent Mann Chinese 6. The exterior of the theater is meant to resemble a giant red Chinese pagoda. The design features a Chinese dragon across the fa√ßade, with two authentic Ming Dynasty guardian lions guarding the main entrance and the silhouettes of tiny dragons along the sides of the copper roof. The idea was to give viewers a sense of China, about which most Americans knew very little. The freestanding ticket booth installed in the 1930s and the left and right neon marquees have been removed, restoring the theater to its original appearance. The auditorium has been completely restored, along with much of the exterior; however, wear and tear on the physical structure over the years has caused some of the external d√©cor to be removed. The Chinese Theatre hosted the 1944, 1945, and 1946 Academy Awards ceremonies; they are now held at the adjacent Dolby Theatre, formerly known as the Kodak Theatre. TCL Chinese Theatre continues to serve the public as a first-run movie theatre.

The vents are concealed behind the imported decorative pillars on the side walls of the auditorium. A concession stand was not in the theater's original plans because Grauman thought it would detract from the \\"theatrical experience\\". The theater began to sell concessions in the 1930s. Celebrities contributed to the theater's decor. Xavier Cugat painted the trees and foliage between the pillars on the side walls. Keye Luke painted the Chinese murals in the lobby. A 3 manual 17 rank Wurlitzer organ was installed. Its pipes were above the proscenium with tone chutes directing the sound through holes in the ceiling. Handprints Many older entries contain personal messages to Sid Grauman, such as Myrna Loy's 1936 contribution. Loy's first job was as a dancer at the theatre in the 1920s. Nearly 200 Hollywood celebrity handprints, footprints, and autographs are in the concrete of the theater's forecourt. Fairbanks and Pickford were the first, done on April 30, 1927. Anthony Quinn footprints outside the Chinese Theatre Variations of this honored tradition are imprints of the eyeglasses of Harold Lloyd, the cigar of Groucho Marx, the dreadlock of Whoopi Goldberg, the wands used by Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, the facial profile of John Barrymore (reflecting his nickname \\"The Great Profile\\"), and the legs of Betty Grable. Western stars William S. Hart and Roy Rogers left imprints of their guns. Herbie, a Volkswagen Beetle, left the imprints of his tires. The hoofprints of \\"Tony\\", the horse of Tom Mix, \\"Champion\\", the horse of Gene Autry, and \\"Trigger\\", the horse of Rogers, were left in the concrete beside the prints of the stars who rode them in the movies. Since 2011, a surge of concrete ceremonies has occurred, many of which have been paid for by movie studios for publicity reasons. One of the theater's current owners, Donald Kushner, acknowledged this and referred to them as mock ceremonies. This influx has been a matter of concern for film buffs and historians, as well as misleading for fans. However, despite the increase of concrete blocks, the ones placed within the forecourt are still chosen by a special committee which selects celebrities based on their contributions to Hollywood cinema. Practice blocks, completed inside the theater before the ceremony, are placed on the walls of the Chinese 6 Theatre lobby, which is also used as an event space. IMAX conversion In April 2013, owners announced plans to convert the original theatre for IMAX. The new silver screen is curved and can be masked for premieres and screening events of non-IMAX films. To accommodate better sightlines and a taller screen, seating was re-arranged in stepped rows, descending from street level to the floor of the former basement. The auditorium's decorative walls and ceiling remain unaltered, the existing curtain was extended, decorative lighting effects were added and TCL added digital signage. The theatre reopened on September 20, 2013, with the IMAX 3D version of The Wizard of Oz. Although it opened with only a digital projection system, a 70 mm projection system was added for Interstellar. In April 2015, the IMAX system was upgraded to use the new dual-4K IMAX with Laser projector system for the premiere of Furious 7. Recreations A full-scale recreation of the Chinese Theatre's exterior facade and lobby exists at Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The recreation originally housed The Great Movie Ride which opened with the park on May 1, 1989 and closed on August 13, 2017. Its replacement attraction, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, opened on March 4, 2020. It also has concrete handprints inside the sidewalks from the years 1988‚Äì1995. A sized-down recreation of the Chinese Theatre, both interior and exterior was built at Parque Warner Madrid theme park in San Mart√≠n de la Vega, near Madrid, Spain. The building shows films relevant to Warner Bros., previously The Lego Movie and Storks. During Halloween, horror films for guests over the age of 18 are shown such as Friday the 13th.

DeMille. It depicts the last weeks of Jesus before his crucifixion and stars H. B. Warner in the lead role. Featuring the opening and resurrection scenes in two-color Technicolor, the film is the second in DeMille's Biblical trilogy, preceded by The Ten Commandments (1923) and followed by The Sign of the Cross (1932). Plot The King of Kings (1927) trailer Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a wild courtesan, entertaining many men around her. Upon learning that Judas is with a carpenter she rides out on her chariot drawn by zebras to get him back. Peter is introduced as the Giant apostle, and we see the future gospel writer Mark as a child who is healed by Jesus. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is shown as a beautiful and saintly woman who is a mother to all her son's followers. The first sight of Jesus is through the eyesight of a little girl, whom he heals. He is surrounded by a halo. Mary Magdelene arrives afterwards and talks to Judas, who reveals that he is only staying with Jesus in hopes of being made a high official after Jesus becomes the king of kings. Jesus casts the Seven Deadly Sins out of Mary Magdalene in a multiple exposure sequence. Jesus is also shown resurrecting Lazarus and healing the little children. Some humor is derived when one girl asks if he can heal broken legs, and, when he says yes, she gives him a legless doll. Jesus smiles and repairs the doll. The crucifixion is foreshadowed when Jesus, having helped a poor family, wanders through the father's carpentry shop, and, himself a carpenter's son, he briefly helps carve a piece of wood. When a sheet covering the object is removed, it is revealed to be a cross towering over Jesus. Jesus and his apostles enter Jerusalem, where Judas incites the people and rallies them to proclaim Jesus King of the Jews. Jesus, however, renounces all claims of being an Earthly king. Caiaphas the High Priest is also angry at Judas for having led people to a man whom he sees as a false prophet. Meanwhile, Jesus drives away Satan, who had offered him an Earthly kingdom, and he protects a woman caught in adultery. The words he draws in the sand are revealed to be the sins the accusers themselves committed. Judas, desperate to save himself from Caiaphas, agrees to turn over Jesus. Noticeably at the Last Supper, when Jesus distributes the bread and wine saying that they are his body and blood, Judas refuses to eat. Judas puts the cup to his lips but refuses to drink; he tears off a piece of bread but lets it drop to the ground. Towards the end, Mary confronts her son and tells him to flee from the danger that is coming. Jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples. They leave the room but the camera focuses on the table upon which a dove alights for a moment. Jesus goes to the Garden of Gethsemane where he is soon captured by the Roman soldiers and betrayed by Judas. Judas' life is saved, but, upon seeing that Jesus is going to be killed as a result, he is horrified. Judas takes a rope that the Romans had used to bind Jesus' wrists and runs off. Jesus is beaten and then presented by Pontius Pilate to the crowd. Mary pleads for the life of her son and Mary Magdalene speaks for him but Caiaphas bribes the crowd to shout against Jesus. Jesus is taken away to be crucified, though he pauses on the Via Dolorosa to heal a group of cripples in an alley, despite his weakened condition. Jesus is crucified and his enemies throw insults at him. (One woman even anachronistically eats popcorn and smiles with glee at Jesus' crucifixion.) When Jesus does die, however, a great earthquake comes up. The tree where Judas had hanged himself, with the rope used to bind Jesus's wrists, is swallowed up amidst gouts of hellfire. The sky turns black, lightning strikes, the wind blows, the people who had mocked Jesus run in terror, and the veil covering the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple is torn in two. The tumult ends when Mary looks up at heaven and asks God to forgive the world for the death of their son. The chaos ends and the Sun shines. Jesus is taken down from the cross and is buried. On the third day, he rises from the dead as promised. To emphasize the importance of the resurrection, this scene from an otherwise black and white film is shot in color. Jesus goes to the Apostles and tells them to spread his message to the world. He tells them \\"I am with you always\\" as the scene shifts to a modern city to show that Jesus still watches over his followers. Many of the film's intertitles are quotes (or paraphrases) from Scripture, often with chapter and verse accompanying. Cast *H. B.

Production details A giant gate built for this film was later used in the 1933 film King Kong, and was among the sets torched for the \\"burning of Atlanta\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939). Other sets and costumes were re-used for the 1965 Elvis Presley film, Harum Scarum. The King of Kings was the first movie that premiered at the noted Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, California on May 18, 1927. The film was screened there again on May 24, 1977 to commemorate the theater's 50th anniversary. The movie has two Technicolor sequences, the beginning and the resurrection scene, which use the two-strip process invented by Herbert Kalmus. Accolades In 2008, AFI nominated this film for its Top 10 Epic Films list. It is widely considered to be among the most popular Hollywood biblical epic films depicting the life of Christ. In what is considered one of the earliest applications of market segmentation to film promotion, students ranging from elementary to high school were dismissed early to attend afternoon screenings of the film. King of Kings was seen by around 500 million viewers between its original release in 1927 and the remake in 1961. Lawsuit In 1928, actress Valeska Surratt and scholar Mirza Ahmad Sohrab sued DeMille for stealing the scenario for The King of Kings from them.The Helena Independent (Helena, Montana), February 25, 1928 The case went to trial in February 1930 but eventually was settled without additional publicity. Surratt, who had left films to return to the stage in 1917, appeared to be unofficially blacklisted after the suit.

The American shad is not closely related to the other North American shads. Rather, it seems to form a lineage that diverged from a common ancestor of the European taxa before these diversified.Faria, R.; Weiss, S. & Alexandrino, P.

Traditionally, a little vinegar is sprinkled over it on the plate. In the Eastern United States, roe shads (females) are prized because the eggs are considered a delicacy. The name \\"shad\\" derives from the Old English sceadd, meaning \\"herring\\"; it is a cognate to Irish, Welsh, and Scottish Gaelic words for herring. Life history The shad spends most of its life in the Atlantic Ocean, but swims up freshwater rivers to spawn. Northern populations are iteroparous, thus they may survive breeding, return to the sea, and then return to fresh waters to spawn several more times. However, southern populations exhibit semelparity, similar to Pacific salmon. In the marine environment, shad are schooling fish. Thousands are often seen at the surface in spring, summer, and autumn. They are hard to find in the winter, as they tend to go deeper before spawning season in the range ; they have been pulled up in nets as deep as . Like other herrings, the American shad is primarily a plankton feeder, but eats small shrimp and fish eggs. Occasionally they eat small fish, but these are only a minor item in their general diet. The sexually mature American shad enter coastal rivers in spring or early summer, usually when the river water has warmed to . Cooler water appears to interrupt the spawn. Consequently, the shad run correspondingly later in the year passing from south to north along the coast, commencing in Georgia in January; in March in the waters tributary to Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds; in April in the Potomac; and in May and June in northern streams generally from Delaware to Canada. In large rivers, such as the Connecticut, American shad run far upstream. The apparent longest distance is in the St. Johns River of Florida, an extremely slow (drops 1 in per mile, 1.5 cm per km) river that widens into large lakes; shad have been found upriver. The spawning fish select sandy or pebbly shallows and deposit their eggs primarily between sundown and midnight. Females release eggs in batches of about 30,000 eggs, though an estimated as many as 156,000 eggs are deposited by very large fish. Total annual egg production is 200,000‚Äì600,000 eggs per female with larger fish producing more. In rivers north of Cape Fear, the spent fish, now very emaciated, return to the sea immediately after spawning. In southern rivers, most shad die after spawning. The eggs are transparent, pale pink, or amber, and being semibuoyant and not sticky like those of other herrings, they roll about on the bottom with the current. The eggs hatch in 12 to 15 days at , in six to eight days at , which covers the range characteristic of Maine and Bay of Fundy rivers during the season of incubation. The fry are about long. Juvenile shad remain in the rivers until fall, when they move down to salt water; they are now long, resembling their parents in appearance. Ecology and diet As adults, shad filter feed at sea and during their return journey to spawn. They are pursued and hunted by marine predators, striped bass, and at times, harbor seals. They may not actively feed on their return, and are caught with special 'dart' lures instead of typical bait. Harbor seal in freshwater Connecticut River, following the shad run Nutritional information Like most herring species, American shad are very high in omega 3 fatty acids, and in particular contain nearly twice as much per unit weight as wild salmon. They are also very low in toxins such as PCBs, dioxins, and mercury by EPA estimatess. The American or Atlantic shad (A. sapidissima) is a valued food fish. Shad populations survey at the Holyoke Dam fish ladder, circa 1970 Declines in the Atlantic coast shad population were documented as early as the turn of the 20th century. Traditionally, shad were caught along with salmon in set nets, which were suspended from poles driven into the river bed reasonably close to shore in tidal water. Many of the rivers where shad were once common now suffer from pollution; however, the short time spent by shad in fresh water may minimize contamination. For example, fisheries scientists have found that shad in the Hudson River are not in the river long enough to be affected by PCBs and other contaminants (however, fishing for or possessing American shad [including catch and release] in the Hudson River or Marine District is now prohibited).New York State Freshwater Fishing 2010‚Äì2011 Official Regulations Guide Pollution, however, may impact shad reproduction and studies have been undertaken to determine whether fingerlings suffer DNA damage. Most of the rivers across the historic range of shad are now heavily dammed, eliminating many of the spawning grounds. For example, the number of shad harvested in the Merrimack River declined from almost 900,000 in 1789 to none in 1888, likely due to the inability to reach their spawning ground following a period of heavy dam construction. Since then, fish passage efforts have begun to remedy this situation, including the Chesapeake Bay program. While recreational angling has almost no measurable impact on shad populations, they are susceptible to commercial overfishing. Because of their highly migratory life history and their recreational and commercial importance, American shad are co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and state fisheries agencies. The Atlantic States Marine Fish Commission serves as a key forum for coordinating the collective effort to conserve American shad. =Introduced in the North Pacific= American shad were introduced into the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento River system in California in the 1800s, and they have spread throughout many river systems on the West Coast of North America. A large shad population occurs in the Columbia River. In recent years, shad counts at Bonneville and The Dalles Dams have ranged from over two million to over five million fish per year. Spawning shad return to the Columbia in May and June and migrate above Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River and above Priest Rapids Dam on the Upper Columbia. Unlike many introduced species, American shad have not been confirmed to have serious negative effects on the environment or other native fish species in the Columbia. American shad are also occasionally found on the Northwest Pacific coast in Kamchatka, Russia.A. sapidissima (Wilson,1811) - –∞–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —à—ç–¥ –ü–æ–∑–≤–æ–Ω–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. sevin.ru Shad fishing Peedee (Greater Pee Dee) River, South Carolina Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behaviors while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Society and culture Shad serve notable symbolic roles in regional politics and culture. On the year of every gubernatorial election, would-be candidates, lobbyists, campaign workers, and reporters gather in the town of Wakefield, Virginia, for Shad Planking. Similarly, in Connecticut, the towns of Essex and Windsor hold annual shad festivals. Each spring, the town of Lambertville, New Jersey, on the Delaware River across from New Hope, Pennsylvania, also hosts an annual Shad Festival.

When the mania ended, most of the titles were canceled. Ghost, one of the imprint's more unorthodox titles, managed to survive the longest. It was canceled twice, first in early 1998, before being revived later that year and canceled again after a run of just less than two years. All Comics' Greatest World titles took place in a shared universe. Most of the action centered on four cities in a slightly skewed version of America: Arcadia, Golden City, Steel Harbor, and the Cinnibar Flats area of Nevada, home of an interdimensional rift called the \\"Vortex\\". The series started off with a story in Dark Horse Comics before kicking off in four weekly limited series, introducing the cities and characters. These were followed by several short-lived series, one-shots, and mini-series. Only a few titles lasted very long. Around April 1995, the imprint was renamed \\"Dark Horse Heroes\\". With the name change, the use of the city logos was also dropped. Environs =Arcadia= First appearance: Dark Horse Comics #8 (intro of X) \\"Arcadia is an orderly, smoothly run machine of a city.

He is the third base coach for the New York Yankees of MLB. He spent twelve seasons as a player in MLB, appearing in 1,217 games played between 1995 and 2006 for the Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers, Anaheim Angels, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins. Nevin attended California State University, Fullerton, where he played college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans team. He led the Titans to the championship game in the 1992 College World Series (CWS), after which he was named the CWS Most Outstanding Player and won the Golden Spikes Award. Chosen with the first-overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, Nevin went on to play in MLB for seven teams across 12 seasons. He was selected to appear in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. After retiring, Nevin went into broadcasting, and then managed the unaffiliated Orange County Flyers for a season. He managed the Class AA Erie SeaWolves and the Class AAA Toledo Mud Hens in the Tigers organization before joining the Arizona Diamondbacks organization in 2014, managing the Reno Aces. He then returned to MLB to coach the San Francisco Giants in 2017 and for the Yankees before the 2018 season. Playing career =Amateur career= Nevin attended El Dorado High School in Placentia, California. After graduating, he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft with the 82nd overall selection. He decided to attend California State University, Fullerton after turning down an offer that included a signing bonus of $100,000. A two-sport star, Nevin played American football and baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, competing in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. He was a punter and placekicker on the Cal State Fullerton Titans football team. He was named an All-American placekicker his freshman year for the Titans as he connected successfully on his first nine field goal attempts and finished the year with a 15-for-21 field goal percentage. His longest field goal of the season was . In his junior year, he averaged per punt. For the Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team, Nevin batted .358 with 56 runs batted in (RBI) as a freshman. The Titans won the conference championship and reached the 1990 College World Series (CWS) that year. The Titans lost two games in the 1990 CWS, however, and were eliminated. Nevin batted .335 in his sophomore season. As a junior, he batted .391 with 20 home runs and 71 RBI, winning the Big West Conference Triple Crown. Collegiate Baseball and Baseball America named Nevin the College Player of the Year. He credited his past CWS experience with allowing him to remain calm. In three seasons at Cal State Fullerton, Nevin had a .364 average with 39 home runs and 184 RBI. He led the Titans to the finals of the 1992 CWS, where the Titans lost to the Pepperdine Waves baseball team, which represented the West Coast Conference. Despite the loss, Nevin was voted the CWS Most Outstanding Player after he batted 10-for-19 with two home runs and 11 RBI. He also won the Golden Spikes Award, given to the best amateur player in the nation. =Draft= The Houston Astros chose Nevin with the first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had evaluated Derek Jeter extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1 million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to the best player in the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft. Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, said the team believed Nevin was close to a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball in an effort to prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus. =International career= Nevin tried out for the United States national baseball team in the summer of 1990 to play in that year's Goodwill Games and World University Baseball Championship (WUBC). To prepare for those tournaments, the team played a series against Japan and a game in Cuba. Nevin played second and third base for Team USA in 13 of its 22 games, batting .229. The team released him before the Goodwill Games and WUBC as it cut players to meet the roster maximum. Nevin was also considered for the 1991 Pan American Games. Nevin tried out for Team USA again before the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The team embarked on a 30-game tour and 38-city exhibition-game schedule in the United States before leaving for Spain. He made the team and served as its starting third baseman throughout the tournament. Olympic coach Ron Fraser called Nevin an excellent player and student of the game. The United States finished fourth out of eight teams in the Olympics. =Professional career= Prospect years (1992‚Äì1997) Nevin traveled with the Astros at the end of their 1992 season but was not on the team's roster. The Astros sent Nevin to the instructional Arizona Fall League during the off-season. Before the 1993 season, Baseball America ranked Nevin as the 30th-best prospect in baseball. The Astros considered sending Nevin to the Jackson Generals of the Class AA Texas League to start his professional career. The team also considered promoting him directly to the major leagues, skipping the minor leagues entirely. At the Astros' spring training in 1993, Nevin batted .350 and showed good power hitting. The Astros weighed bringing Nevin to Houston for Opening Day as they sought to add a right-handed batter to complement the left-handed power of Luis Gonzalez, Steve Finley and Eric Anthony and make the team less vulnerable to left-handed pitching. But with Ken Caminiti in the first year of a three-year contract to play as the starting third baseman, Nevin had nowhere to play defensively. The Astros assigned him to the Class AAA Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League, one level below the major leagues, where he made his professional debut. While Nevin was with the Toros, the Astros asked Toros manager Rick Sweet to play Nevin as a left fielder, which would allow the Astros to promote Nevin sooner, as he and Caminiti could play different positions. Veteran first baseman Jim Lindeman served as Nevin's mentor, helping him keep his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform. Nevin started the 1993 season with a .247 batting average, but batted .309 with baserunners in scoring position and had 49 RBI. By July, he had made ten starts in left field, without committing an error. The Astros, however, were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in \\"clutch\\" situations to cases where there were no baserunners and the score was not close. Nevin's intensity almost got the best of him during a June 1993 game with Tucson. He was taunted by a man seated in the front row, and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before he was restrained by teammates. The fan was arrested. Nevin played third base and left field in 1993. He batted .286 that season, with 10 home runs and 91 RBI. He had a .359 on-base percentage (OBP) and .413 slugging percentage (SLG). Baseball America rated him the 24th best prospect before the 1994 season. He returned to Tucson that year, posting a .263 batting average with 12 home runs and 71 RBI. He had a .343 OBP, and .393 SLG. Nevin also played first base. His major-league debut, however, was delayed both by his defense (61 errors in his first two seasons) and the MLB 1994‚Äì95 work stoppage. The Astros traded Caminiti to the San Diego Padres before the 1995 season. With Caminiti no longer blocking his path to the major leagues, Nevin hoped he would be named the Astros' starting third baseman. But the Astros did not invite him to spring training. Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal to work out with replacement players during the work stoppage. Not wanting to be seen as \\"scabs\\" by the Major League Baseball Players Association, minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players, while career minor-leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues. When prospects including Nevin and Billy Wagner refused to play with the replacement players, Astros' general manager Bob Watson issued an ultimatum, saying anyone who refused to play in the team's first exhibition game would be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract. The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season, while Dave Magadan started at third base on Opening Day. The Astros also planned to use Shipley and Chris Donnels at third base. With the Toros in 1995, Nevin's batting average improved to .291. He also posted a .367 OBP, and .463 SLG, while contributing seven home runs and 41 RBI. The Astros promoted him on June 10, 1995, and he made his major-league debut a day later. Nevin played 18 games for the Astros during the 1995 season. He struggled with the Astros, however, batting .117 with no home runs, one RBI, a .221 OBP, and .133 SLG in 60 at-bats. When he learned of his demotion to Tucson on July 5 in Colorado, Nevin cursed at Watson and Astros manager Terry Collins. After Watson called for an apology, Nevin said he would use the incident as a learning experience in controlling his temper. The Astros acquired pitcher Mike Henneman from the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named later on August 10; Nevin was identified as the player five days later. In 1996, Nevin played in Class AA for the Tigers with the Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League, where he was converted into a catcher by Jacksonville manager and former catcher Bill Plummer. Recovering from earlier struggles (1998‚Äì2001) After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was manager, for minor league player Nick Skuse. After an injury to starting catcher Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity to compete for the starting job with Walbeck. Nevin, by then well known for his volatile temper, tore off his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the home plate umpire in a 1998 game. Before the 1999 season, the Angels traded Nevin and minor league player Keith Volkman to the San Diego Padres. Nevin made a late-career break with the Padres, appearing in 100 games for the first time during the 1999 season. He then had the best offensive years of his career: he hit 31 home runs with a .916 on-base plus slugging (OPS) during the 2000 season. He was named to the National League All-Star team in , when he hit 41 home runs with 126 RBI and had a .976 OPS. He also led major-league third basemen in errors, however, with 27, and had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league third basemen (.930). Injuries and final seasons (2002‚Äì2006) Nevin in 2002 played first base, which was considered his strongest defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, he missed time with a strained left elbow. Three games after returning from the elbow injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks. After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan the finger, for which he apologized. Nevin suffered a dislocated shoulder in spring training in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder and returned to the Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI for the third time in his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July. Nevin was often frustrated with the dimensions of Petco Park. He hit a double during a 2004 game that he believed would have been a home run in other stadiums; when he reached second base, he pointed toward Padres' general manager Kevin Towers' suite and threw down his helmet, resulting in a postgame argument. Towers said the two had a \\"love-hate\\" relationship. Two nights after San Diego Padres management informed Nevin that Xavier Nady would replace him as the starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Sidney Ponson on July 25, 2005. Nevin exercised a clause in his contract that gave him the right to block transactions that would send him to any of eight franchises, one of which was the Orioles. He was instead traded on July 30, a day before the non-waiver trade deadline, to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park, whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump. In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team posted a 1‚Äì12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44. That put his season batting average under .200, known as the \\"Mendoza Line\\". The Rangers benched Nevin in September, giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adri√°n Gonz√°lez after the team was eliminated from playoff contention. In his first game back in the lineup on September 24, his average dropped to .182. He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed. Nevin had one year remaining on a contract worth $9 million. Manager Buck Showalter said that despite Nevin's benching at the end of the 2005 season, he was his starting designated hitter for the 2006 season. Despite hopes that help from renowned hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo and the hitter-friendly Ameriquest Field would increase Nevin's offensive production in 2006, he continued to struggle. He batted .216 with nine home runs and 31 RBI in 46 games. The Rangers promoted rookie Jason Botts on May 23, and Botts began to receive Nevin's playing time. Nevin had only two hits in his last 32 at-bats with the Rangers, though both of them were home runs. The Chicago Cubs sought a slugging first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay the difference in the two players' salaries. On August 31, the deadline for trades of players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to the Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, Twins' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list. With the Twins, Nevin stopped worrying about his statistics and enjoyed playing in a pennant race. Nevin appeared in the MLB postseason for the first time in his career with the Twins in 2006. The Twins were swept by the Oakland Athletics in three games; Nevin appeared in one of the three games, batting 0-for-3. Post-playing career Unsigned at the beginning of the following season, Nevin announced his retirement on May 12, 2007. During his twelve-season career, Nevin had a .270 batting average with 208 home runs and 743 RBI in 1,217 games. After retiring, Nevin joined the Padres' pre-game radio show. He also joined ESPN as an analyst for the college baseball regionals during the College World Series. Two seasons removed from his playing career, Nevin decided to return to baseball as a manager in 2008. That December, he was named the manager of the Orange County Flyers in the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL). The Flyers finished with a 37‚Äì39 record in 2009, fourth in the five-team GBL. Nevin planned to return to the Flyers in 2010, but a chance meeting at baseball's winter meetings led to Nevin's hiring as manager of the Erie SeaWolves, the Class-AA minor-league affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. He replaced the previous manager, Tom Brookens after Brookens was promoted to the Tigers' major-league first-base coach. Nevin (right) with Gleyber Torres in 2018 Nevin managed the SeaWolves for one season. On November 11, 2010, Nevin was named manager of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Tigers' Class AAA minor league affiliate. He is considered a potential future MLB manager. Catcher Omir Santos described his managing the Mud Hens as \\"like having a big league manager in [Class AAA].\\" On August 31, 2013, Nevin was fired after the team's final home game of the season. Nevin's record as manager was 192‚Äì238; the team never finished higher than third in the International League's West division. The Arizona Diamondbacks named Nevin as manager of the Reno Aces, their Class AAA affiliate, for the 2014 season. In his first season with Reno, he guided the Aces to a Pacific Coast League-best 81-63 record and an eventual Pacific Coast League Championship Series berth. After the season, the Astros interviewed Nevin for their open managerial position. However Nevin remained the manager of the Reno Aces for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. On November 7, 2016, the San Francisco Giants named Nevin their third-base coach for the 2017 season, succeeding Roberto Kelly. After the 2017 season, the New York Yankees hired Nevin to be their third base coach. Personal life Nevin's first daughter, Koral, was born during his freshman year at Cal State Fullerton; he is no longer in a relationship with Koral's mother. He met his wife, Kristin, at Cal State Fullerton. The couple have two children together; though they were separated during the late 1990s, the couple reconciled. His son, Tyler Nevin, was drafted by the Colorado Rockies as the 38th pick in the 2015 MLB draft. Nevin lives in the Heritage Estates neighborhood of Poway, California, along with San Diego sporting figures including Bruce Bochy and LaDainian Tomlinson. The neighborhood suffered significant damage in the October 2007 California wildfires. Nevin hosted a baseball camp for children aged six through 16 in 2010.

It is found in the Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, except for large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic, from the surface to depths of . The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin. Tests in the 1920s estimated that the Atlantic sailfish was capable of short sprints of up to 111 kilometres per hour; however, more conservative estimates of 37 to 55 kilometres per hour are more widely accepted.Burton, M. and Burton, R. (2002) International Wildlife Encyclopedia. Marshall Cavendish, New York. More recent studies even suggest sailfish do not exceed swimming speeds of . Atlantic sailfish hunt schooling fish, such as sardines, anchovies and mackerel although they also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods. Description Ernest Hemingway in Key West, Florida, USA, in the 1940s, with an Atlantic sailfish he had caught The Atlantic sailfish is a metallic blue fish with a large sail-like dorsal fin and a long and pointed bill-like snout. It is dark bluish-black on the upperparts and lighter on the sides (counter-shading), with about twenty bluish horizontal bars along the flanks; the underparts are silvery white. The tail fin is strongly forked. The fins are bluish-black and the front dorsal fin is speckled with small black spots. The bases of the anal fins are pale. The length of this fish is up to and the maximum published weight is . In previous studies, sailfish hunting schools of sardines rely heavily upon stealth and quick slashing or tapping with the rostrum in order to temporarily immobilize prey and facilitate capture in small prey. The adaptive advantage of the bill is highly debated and many different functions have been suggested. The bill has been hypothesized to increase the hydrodynamic qualities of the fish and even to ward off predators. However, it has been well documented that the sailfish utilizes the bill in hunting. Distribution and habitat The Atlantic sailfish is a pelagic fish of tropical and temperate waters in the Atlantic Ocean. It ranges from approximately 40¬∞N in the northwestern Atlantic to 40¬∞S in the southwestern Atlantic, and 50¬∞N in the northeastern Atlantic to 32¬∞S in the southeastern Atlantic. It is a migratory species and moves about the open ocean and into the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range is from warm surface waters down to about . Taxonomy Some authorities only recognise a single species of sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, with I. albicans being treated as a synonym for I. platyperus.

Stony Place (, Kamenskoye) until 1936 Dniprodzerzhinsk and several more cities got new names. Ukrayinska Pravda. 19 May 2016 when it was renamed to Dniprodzerzhynsk - the name honored the Dnieper River () and the communist Felix Dzerzhynsky (1877-1926), the founder of the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was born and raised in Kamianske. On 15 May 2015 the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with names related to Communism. Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization.

An overcrowded tram that was moving along a steep hill on Chapaeva Street began to slide rapidly downhill (because of a brake failure), causing it to derail and hit a concrete wall before coming to a stop very close to a school. A total of 34 people died and more than 100 received injuries as a result of the accident. Following a government inquiry into the causes of the accident, the then mayor, Serhiy Shershnev, and his deputy, Ihor Laktionov, resigned. Geography While mostly located on right bank of Dnieper, Kamianske stretches over the hydroelectric station onto the left bank where the portion of city is known as \\"Livyi bereh\\" neighborhood (literally Left bank). The neighborhood arches to the west of the Kamianske's suburb of Kurylivka. To the east Kamianske municipality borders Dnipro city creating an urban sprawl.

Mercedita was built at Brooklyn, New York in 1861. She was purchased by the Union Navy on 31 July 1861 from J. C. Jewett & Co., and commissioned at New York on 8 December 1861, Commander Henry S. Stellwagen in command. Civil War service Mercedita joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron on 3 January 1862, and the next day chased two vessels attempting to run the blockade; Julia and an unidentified ship ran aground trying to escape and were set afire by their crews. In March, Mercedita was ordered to Apalachicola, Florida to relieve in West Pass. There she destroyed the Confederate batteries at St. Vincent Island, Florida on 21 March. She and captured Apalachicola on 3 April. Mercedita pursued blockade runner Magnolia on 12 April, but during the chase Confederate ships Whitmore and Florida slipped through the blockade. Mercedita captured blockade runner Bermuda on 27 April and schooners Victoria and Ida on 12 July. In September, she transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina on 19 September. She served on the blockade of Charleston Harbor until the end of January 1863. On the night of 31 January, CSS Palmetto State and Chicora, both Confederate ironclad rams, slipped out of the main ship channel of the harbor. They hoped to recapture British iron propeller Princess Royal, taken by Union blockaders two days earlier with two powerful steam engines for new Confederate ironclads aboard. Mercedita was the first Union ship the southern raiders encountered, and Palmetto State succeeded in ramming her, ripping a hole in her keel, piercing her boiler, and leaving her in a sinking condition. Challenged \\"Surrender or I'll sink you,\\" Mercedita ‚Äî unable to move or bring her guns to bear ‚Äî struck her colors. However, the Confederate rams ‚Äî eager for further action ‚Äî accepted paroles for Merceditas officers and crew and sped off to attack , and before retiring to Charleston. Hardly captured before abandoned, Mercedita made temporary repairs before proceeding to Port Royal, South Carolina and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for complete repairs. In April, she was attached to the West Indies Squadron, to escort California steamers over part of their route, from New York to Aspinwall, Panama. Later that spring, she joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and operated from Beaufort, North Carolina for much of the remainder of the year. Joining the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in March 1865, she saw only brief action with it. In May, she searched for . When the conflict ended, the Union Navy resumed its peacetime activities, protecting American citizens and their property throughout the world. Mercedita went to Santo Domingo on 3 August to protect Americans there. Arriving at Ciudad de Santo Domingo on 11 August, the ship found the country in an unsettled political state, but there was no sign of the reported Spanish man-of-war on the southern coast. Mercedita departed Santo Domingo on 14 August, touching at Kingston, Jamaica on 17 August for coal en route home. Post-war service Decommissioned on 14 October 1865, Mercedita was sold at public auction at New York on 25 October, and redocumented in merchant service on 9 November. She was converted to a brigantine on 16 June 1879.

This eventually led to the territory's secession from Mexico and the founding of the Republic of Texas. Anahuac was located on the east side of the Trinity River near the north shore of Galveston Bay, which placed it astride the trade route between Texas and Louisiana, and from there to the rest of the United States. In new attempts to curtail smuggling and enforce customs tariffs from the coastal settlements, Mexico placed a garrison there after 1830. American settlers came into conflict with Mexican military officers, and rose up against them. They increased political activity and residents of numerous communities declared support for the federalists, who were revolting against the Mexican Government. Background After Mexico gained independence from Spain, it legalized immigration from the United States. Empresarios were granted contracts to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. As the number of Americans living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties.Henson (1982), pp. 47-8. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly an American citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay.Henson (1982), p. 49. In October 1830 Bradburn established a post atop a bluff at the entrance to the Trinity River. The post became known as Anahuac.Henson (1982), p. 51. Bradburn was unpopular from the beginning of his tenure with those seeking to expand the Anglo-American presence in Texas. He opposed the efforts of the state land commissioner to grant titles to settlers who lived near Anahuac. The Mexican Constitution of 1824 prohibited immigrants from settling within of the coast, and most of these settlers lived too close to the coast.Henson (1982), pp. 58-62. Although the commissioner was finally able to grant the titles, Anglo settlers were angry with Bradburn for enforcing Mexican law.Henson (1982), pp. 63, 65. In January 1832, Bradburn received a letter listing 10 men in his jurisdiction who wanted to separate Texas from Mexico. From that point on, \\"Bradburn became increasingly obsessed about the Anglo-Americans and their intentions, believing that every event was part of a conspiracy to detach Texas.\\"Henson (1982), p. 87. In June 1832, two of Bradburn's soldiers attacked an Anglo woman settler. Angry settlers tarred and feathered a neighbor who failed to aid her. They demanded that Bradburn turn over the soldiers for a similar punishment.Henson (1982), p. 89. After Bradburn refused, local men organized a Texian Militia company, supposedly to protect the settlement from the Indians.The only natives in the area were peaceful. Henson (1982), p. 90. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias, so Bradburn arrested the ringleader, Patrick Jack. After Bradburn received death threats, he released Jack.Henson (1982), p. 90. 1832 Disturbance =Prelude= Tensions between Bradburn and the colonists escalated. Bradburn strongly supported the Mexican law forbidding slavery. In August 1831 he gave asylum to three men who had escaped slavery in Louisiana. The owner retained local lawyer William Barret Travis to represent him in trying to get the slaves returned.Henson (1982), p. 95. In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter, ostensibly from a friend, warning that 100 armed men would come from Louisiana to reclaim the slaves. When Bradburn realized that the letter was a hoax, he arrested William B. Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection to separate the territory from Mexico. Conviction on this charge would lead to Travis's execution.Davis (2006), p. 83. Unfamiliar with Mexican law, the settlers were outraged that Bradburn could arrest the man without a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most erroneously assumed they were still covered by the United States Bill of Rights.Henson (1982), p. 96. Jack threatened Bradburn, who arrested him again.Henson (1982), p. 97. Travis and Jack then began plotting their escape. They attempted to smuggle letters to David G. Burnet, a fellow instigator; the letters called on Texians to aid them, but stopped short of calling for armed rebellion. Bradburn intercepted the letters before delivery. Although settlers at first did not get involved, they became alarmed at learning that Bradburn was taking statements from potential witnesses without allowing Travis, Jack, or their legal representation to speak with the witnesses. Jack's brother organized a contingent of men to march from Brazoria to Anahuac. Anglos began arriving from other villages as well. One of the Brazoria councilmen, John Austin, stopped to consult Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who commanded the garrison on the Brazos. Ugartechea recommended that Austin request that the men be remanded into civilian custody.Henson (1982), p. 99. Bradburn's officers explained to Austin and company that the laws prohibited turning the accused men over to civilian authorities. The Brazoria men returned home. After they left, the Mexican officers discovered that their horses had been stolen. They arrested two local men on suspicion of the theft. On hearing of the new arrests, the Brazoria contingent returned to Anahuac. They camped with other angry civilians several miles from Anahuac and elected Frank W. Johnson as commander. The group soon captured Bradburn's nineteen cavalry officers, who had been trying to reconnoiter the Texian position.Henson (1982), p. 100.Henson (1982), p. 101. On June 10, the insurgents occupied buildings in northern Anahuac. Bradburn worried that the armed men wanted to do more than free the American prisoners; he suspected a full-scale revolt. Bradburn had Travis and Jack tied to the ground with weapons pointed at them. Bradburn threatened to shoot both men if the Texians attacked. Travis encouraged Johnson to lead an attack anyway.Davis (2006), p. 84. During the ensuing negotiations, the Texians offered to exchange the cavalry officers for Travis and the other prisoners. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody in exchange for the cavalry officers and for the withdrawal of the Anglos to Turtle Bayou.Henson (1982), p. 103.Henson (1982), p. 104. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, between 15 and 30 of them remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and warned that he would begin firing on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had lied to them just to get them out of the buildings they had occupied. Unbeknownst to the Anglos at the time, the buildings contained extra ammunition and supplies. =Battle of Anahuac= After hearing Bradburn's warning, the women and children of Anahuac fled the town. Mexican soldiers briefly engaged the men who remained; five Mexican soldiers and one Texian died in the conflict. After the skirmish, the remaining Texians gathered at Turtle Bayou to await the arrival of cannons coming from Brazoria. On June 5, the Texians adopted the Turtle Bayou Resolutions. In this document, they announced they were federalists who supported rebellious Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. They decried \\"the present dynasty\\" that kept them under military rather than civil authority.Henson (1982), p. 105. While the Texians waited for their artillery, Bradburn appealed for reinforcements from Colonel Piedras, stationed at Nacogdoches north, and Colonel Elos√∫a at San Antonio, about to the west. On June 19, Piedras and about 100 of his men set out to support Bradburn.Henson (1982), p. 106. John Austin and his men returned to Brazoria for the cannons. On June 20, he called the residents together, and they voted to oppose the centralist government. Austin invited Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who commanded the small Fort Velasco on the Brazos, to join their cause. After Ugartechea refused, on June 26 the Brazoria residents attacked the fort. The action became known as the Battle of Velasco.Henson (1982), p. 107. The next morning, Ugartechea surrendered under an agreement that he and his men would return to Matamoros but leave their artillery behind.Henson (1982), p. 108. When Piedras was within of Anahuac, he sent a delegation to Johnson, who provided him with a list of grievances against Bradburn. Piedras negotiated a resolution of the conflict. Among the measures to which he agreed were: *to reestablish the ayuntamiento at Liberty; *to release the civilian prisoners at Anahuac to civilian authorities *to have Bradburn resign in favor of an officer of his choice. With Texians' acceptance of the terms on June 28, Piedras marched to Anahuac on July 1.Henson (1982), p. 109. =Aftermath= Bradburn's chosen successor, Lieutenant Colonel Felix Maria Subar√°n, refused to take his place.Lieutenant Colonel Felix Maria Subar√°n had been sent to Texas as a political prisoner because he supported the federalist leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna against the current centralist administration. Bradburn believed that Subar√°n would defend Texas against any separation attempts. Henson (1982), p. 103. Piedras took temporary command of the garrison. On July 2, he released the prisoners to the civilian authorities; within a week they were released with no charges filed. On July 8, Piedras left for Nacogdoches. He gave command of the Anahuac garrison to Lieutenant Cortina, previously the third-in-command. Three days after Piedras left, the bulk of the Anahuac troops declared themselves federalists.Henson (1982), p. 110. The troops were drunk and Cortina, unable to maintain order, asked Bradburn to resume command.Travis and Jack likely supplied the alcohol used to intoxicate the soldiers. The two men then gave rousing speeches encouraging the soldiers to declare themselves federalists. Davis (2006), pp. 85-6. Bradburn refused, instead recommending that Subar√°n take responsibility.Henson (1982), p. 111. After an attempt at his assassination was forestalled, Bradburn decided to leave Texas. None of the local ship captains would give him passage. On July 13, Subar√°n announced he would not guarantee the safety of any officers who supported the centralist government. That night, Bradburn left Anahuac; a hired guide took him on foot to Louisiana. Other officers sought sanctuary with sympathetic locals.Henson (1982), pp. 111-2. Historians have discussed Bradburn's role. William C. Davis believes that he \\"overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction\\".Davis (2006), p. 86. The resulting Turtle Bayou Resolutions, however, encouraged other Texians to follow similar courses. Many communities declared support for Santa Anna. When Piedras returned to Nacogdoches, he discovered citizens were forming Texian Militia companies. He asked the local ayuntamiento to order the militias to disband; they refused and instead formed their own militia. On August 1, the combined militias ordered Piedras to vow support for the federalist revolt. When he refused, the Texians attacked and the Battle of Nacogdoches commenced. Several days later, they took Piedras and his men prisoner and \\"convinced\\" them to become federalists.Davis (2006), pp. 86-9. With the soldiers' surrender and retreat into the Mexican interior, no Mexican troops remained in eastern Texas. This encouraged the colonists to increase political activity.Davis (2006), p. 89. Soon after, they organized the Convention of 1832, marking the first attempt to gather Texians from each of the colonies to discuss common goals.Davis (2006), p. 91. 1835 Disturbance A second dispute arose in late June 27, 1835, again over the issue of customs. Leading up to this crisis, a large amount of Anglo settlers had immigrated into the Anahuac area. The current commander was reported as being uneasy about the insubordinate attitudes of the locals, and he requested additional military assistance from his superiors. Tensions continued to escalate as some citizens demonstrated with anti-taxation protests and petitions. In addition, a group known as the Citizens of Texas began to meet with the intention of realizing these demands. Andrew Briscoe, a local merchant and boat captain as well as a member of this group, complained that taxes were not being enforced equally at all ports. He intentionally tested the new commander, Capt. Antonio Tenorio, by loading his boat in a way to increase the curiosity of the officials. Briscoe simply loaded his boat with ballast. Tenorio was incensed and arrested Briscoe and his partner DeWitt Clinton Harris. The soldiers escorting Harris and Briscoe shot and wounded another Texian, young William Smith. Travis played a major role afterward. When news of the arrests was heard in San Felipe de Austin, where radical sentiments were taking hold, the political chief Peter Miller authorized Travis to gather a Texian Militia company for response. Travis commandeered a vessel at Harrisburg, and sailed for Anahuac with the company and a cannon. His 25-man force quickly gained surrender of the more than 40 Mexican troops. After disarming them, Travis and the company freed the Texians and expelled the troops.Looscan, AB., \\"THE OLD FORT AT ANAHUAC\\", Southwestern Historical Quarterly Online, Volume 002, Number 1, pp. 21 - 28, accessed 28 Oct 2006Eugene Barker, Excerpted publications Because Travis had acted without broad community support, he apologized to avoid endangering Stephen F. Austin, then in Mexico City. Austin was the most prominent empresario under contract by the Spanish, and later Mexican, governments to oversee the immigration of people to Mexico's frontier. Later that summer, Mexican military authorities demanded the surrender of Travis for military trial. The colonists opposed this. Travis and Austin continued active in Texas development. Travis died at the Battle of the Alamo. Austin served as secretary of state for the Republic of Texas for a short time before his own death.

He is also the guitarist/bassist for rock band StillWell. Musical career Prior to Arvizu's time in Korn, he and Brian Welch, who would later become one of Korn's two guitarists (alongside James Shaffer), had played together in a number of bands, having become friends while still at school. Upon their graduation from high school, Arvizu, Welch, Shaffer, and drummer David Silveria relocated from Bakersfield to Los Angeles and Arvizu, Shaffer, and Silveria formed L.A.P.D. (the name first stood for \\"Love and Peace, Dude\\", but this abbreviation was later changed to \\"Laughing As People Die\\"). Although L.A.P.D. did succeed in signing a record deal, their success was limited until the band hired singer Jonathan Davis and changed their name to Korn. The name \\"Fieldy\\" is said to have come about as an inside joke. Originally, his bandmates called him \\"Gopher\\", due to his large cheeks. Gopher quickly became \\"Gar\\", Gar became \\"Garfield\\" (based on the comic strip character of the same name), and eventually \\"Gar\\" was dropped and a \\"y\\" was added to \\"Field\\", which became Fieldy. He plays a five-string Ibanez model SDGR SR1305, named the K-5, which is his signature bass. His playing style consists of bass-slapping, standard finger-style plucking, and left-hand muting; his standard tuning is: A, D, G, C, F. He states Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as being one of the main influences towards his playing style. He has also stated to have been influenced by Billy Gould from Faith No More, Cliff Burton from Metallica and Les Claypool of Primus. Fieldy is also one of the main songwriters in Korn. The majority of his bass riffs are hip-hop inspired. He says he gets inspiration from anything hip-hop. On the business side of Korn, Fieldy is responsible for all Korn merchandise, its buying and selling. He comes up with a number of designs, shows them to the band and they either approve or disapprove. In August 2012 it was reported that Fieldy would be taking a brief break from Korn as his wife Dena was expecting a child. Korn began touring through Eastern Europe, Russia and India throughout August and September 2012 with fill-in bassist Ryan Martinie from Mudvayne. Life outside Korn In addition to Korn, he has a rap side project called Fieldy's Dreams. Fieldy's Dreams has released one album titled Rock'n Roll Gangster. Like Head, Fieldy is a Christian. Fieldy has been married three times. He married his current wife, Dena Beber, on May 13, 2006. Fieldy has five children: two daughters, Sarina Rae (Born September 30, 1997) and Olivia Ann Marie Arvizu (Born December 9, 1998), from his second marriage to Shela Colton, and three children from his current marriage to Dena: sons Israel (Born February 9, 2007) and Noa (Born August 13, 2012), and daughter Harmony Rose Arvizu (Born November 27, 2009). Following the death of his father, Fieldy became a born again Christian. Fieldy has stated that his second album, Bassically, was originally intended to be a hardcore rap album, but scrapped the original idea in favor of a jazz fusion style. Fieldy worked with independent rap artist Q-Unique on a side project called StillWell. The song \\"Killing Myself to Live\\" can be heard on their MySpace page. Stillwell's debut album, Dirtbag, released in 2011. Fieldy was also working on his own clothing line 'Immanuel one twenty three'; when asked about it while backstage at the West Palm Beach stop of the Mayhem Festival in 2010, he stated that it was \\"much harder than he had previously expected\\" to start a clothing line, and has moved on to the side project that he can \\"be more proud of, opposed to his first solo CD under Fieldy's Dreams titled Rock'n Roll Gangster\\".

It is one of Phish's most frequently performed songs, featured in 391 live performances since its debut on October 30, 1985.  Background  \\"Harry Hood\\" refers to the Hood Dairy Co., a New England dairy company based in Boston. While the band was living with Brian Long in Burlington, Vermont next to a Hood milk plant, \\"Harry Hood\\" was the company mascot of the Hood Milk Co., and this character was featured in a 1970s television commercial in which people opened their refrigerator to find Harry Hood standing inside. The lyric, \\"Where do you go when the lights go out?\\" most likely refers to this advertisement, and to the automatic light in a refrigerator. A \\"Mr. Minor\\" is also mentioned in the song, a reference to a previous tenant of the house. While living in Mr. Minor's former apartment, calls for Mr. Minor by debt collectors and such would frequently interrupt band rehearsals. For that, the band added the line \\"Thank You, Mr. Minor.\\" The music for the song was written during Trey Anastasio and Jon Fishman's 1985 travels in Europe. While on Pelekas Beach in Greece, they took LSD and decided to swim out to a raft just offshore. A violent storm came in and almost drowned Anastasio. After the near-death experience, Trey sat on the beach and wrote the music to \\"Harry Hood\\".Puterbaugh, Parke. \\"Phish: The Biography\\". De Capo Press, 2009, p. 48.  Structure  The song opens with a reggae section prominently featuring the bass, then moves through several contrasting themes before culminating in an improvised section that begins with a I-V-IV chord progression.  \\"Glowstick wars\\"  \\"Harry Hood\\" is famous among the band's fans for its association with the spontaneous emergence of \\"glowstick wars,\\" a Phish-created audience and band interaction in which multicolored glowsticks were tossed from all points in the crowd, such as during the 1997 \\"Great Went\\" performance featured in the film Bittersweet Motel. \\"Harry Hood\\" was performed at Phish's supposed \\"farewell\\" Coventry two-day gig in 2004 on the rocks in the front of the stage. The rocks were placed in an effort to help control the massive flooding that turned the Coventry event into a muddy mess. Guitarist Trey Anastasio noted that the band was much further away, and so they performed closer to the fans in order to start a conversation among fans who would presumably return to their campsites and discuss whether or not the proximity of the band to the stage affected the \\"flowage of the notes.\\" At the end, the band stopped playing, allowing the audience to sing the ‚ÄúYou can feel good, good, good about Hood‚Äù refrain. Album appearances Although the song has never appeared on a Phish studio album, concerts performances of the song appear on several of the band's live albums. \\"Harry Hood\\" made its first album appearance on the 1995 release A Live One, which includes a performance from an October 1994 concert in Gainesville, Florida. The song subsequently appeared on Hampton Comes Alive (1999; recorded 1998), Live Phish Volume 2 (2001; recorded 1994), Live Phish Volume 9 (2002; recorded 1989), Live Phish Volume 17 (2003; recorded 1998), Live Phish 02.28.03 (recorded and released 2003), Live Phish 04.04.98 (2005; recorded 1998), Colorado '88 (2006; recorded 1988), Vegas 96 (2007; recorded 1996), At the Roxy (2008; recorded 1993), Hampton/Winston-Salem '97 (2011; recorded 1997) and Ventura (2013; recorded 1998). The song has also appeared on concert recordings released by the band through their LivePhish website and on the DVDs Phish: Walnut Creek (released 2008; recorded 1997) and The Clifford Ball (released 2009; recorded 1996).

Truck stops are usually located on or near a busy road. Truck stop services English signs at truck stop in Lax√•, Sweden. Smaller truck stops might consist of only a parking area, a fueling station, and perhaps a diner restaurant. Larger truck stops might have convenience stores of various sizes, showers, a small video arcade, and a TV/movie theater (usually just a projector with an attached DVD player). The largest truck stops, like Iowa 80 (the largest in the world), might have several independent businesses operating under one roof, catering to a wide range of travelers' needs, and might have several major and minor fast-food chains operating a small food court. Larger truck stops also tend to have full-service maintenance facilities for heavy trucks, as well as vehicle wash services that can handle anything from passenger vehicles to large trucks. Some truck stops operate motels or have them adjacent. Most truck stops now offer separate fueling areas, often with dedicated entrances, for standard-sized passenger vehicles. The truck refueling area almost always offers dual pumps, one on each side, so large trucks can fill both tanks at once. (The second pump is referred to as the \\"slave pump\\" or \\"satellite pump.\\") The fuel islands at many truck stops can get very crowded. Most trucking companies have accounts with one or two truck stop chains and, after negotiating a specific price for diesel, require their drivers to fuel exclusively at supported locations. Truck stops near a large city, or on the east or west coasts, suffer from the most congestion at their fuel islands. The retail stores in large truck stops offer a large selection of 12-volt DC products, such as coffee makers, combo television units, toaster ovens, and frying pans primarily targeted towards truck drivers, who often spend extended periods of time on the road. Such shops generally offer a wide selection of maps, road atlases, truck stop and freeway exit guides, truck accessories (such as CB radio equipment and hazmat placards), plus entertainment media such as movies, video games, music, and audiobooks. Increasingly, as interstate truck drivers have become a large market for satellite radio, these retail stores also sell various satellite radio receivers for both XM and Sirius as well as subscriptions to those services. Kiosks run by cellular phone providers are also common. Most long- haul tractors have sleeping berths, and many truck drivers keep their diesel engines running for heating or cooling for the sake of comfort. Because idling diesel engines make considerable noise (and are a source of pollution) they are often banned from such use near residential areas. Truck stops (along with public rest stops) are the main places where truck drivers may rest peacefully, as required by regulations. Modern innovations, such as truck heaters and auxiliary power units, are becoming more common, and some truck stops now provide power, air conditioning, and communications through systems such as IdleAir. Many truck stops used to have load board monitors for truck drivers to find real time information on loads, jobs, weather and news. However, DAT Solutions, the largest provider of load boards, removed its monitors from thousands of truck stops and moved all its services online and to its load board mobile apps.DAT Solutions History Most chain truck stops also have WLAN Internet access in their parking areas. Idle reduction‚Äîreducing the amount of fuel consumed by truck fleets during idling‚Äîis an ongoing economical and environmental effort.http://www1.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/toolbox/pdfs/idleaire_webcast_26jul07.pdf Australia In Australia a roadhouse is a filling station (service station) on a major intercity route. A roadhouse sells fuel and provides maintenance and repairs for cars, but it also has an attached restaurant (usually a caf√© or diner) to sell and serve hot food to travelers. Roadhouses usually also serve as truck stops, providing space for parking of semi-trailer trucks and buses, as well as catering to travelers in private cars. In remote areas such as the Nullarbor Plain, a roadhouse also offers motel-style accommodation and camping facilities. Approximately two thirds of truck stops are independently owned with the remainder being owned and run by 'big oil' brands such as Caltex, BP and Shell.http://acapmag.com.au/2016/06/inconvenient-truth-fuel- retailing-australia/ Germany and Austria Historic German Autohof sign from 1947 The Autohof sign in Germany since 2001 Restaurant at the Autohof Osnabr√ºck In Germany and some parts of Austria there were newer official developments to the existing highway service station. The often state owned service stations at the highway were insufficient to deal with the growing number of lorries and the necessary stops for lorry drivers to rest. Since 2001, the traffic regulations of Germany Stra√üenverkehrsordnung include a road sign, Autohof, literally car yard or automobile court. An Autohof is run by a private company, but the government provides the road signs at the highway, indicating an Autohof, if the facility: * is no more remote from the highway than one kilometre * can be approached by lorries * provides at least 50 places for lorries, or at least 100 at higher frequented roads, those places must be apart from the places for other cars * is open 24 hours a day, all the year through * offers gasoline service 24 hours a day * offers meals from 11.00 to 22.00; other food at the rest of the day * includes sanitary facilities for handicapped people and for the proper needs of lorry drivers United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the term \\"truck stop\\" is not in common use and the equivalent stops are motorway services. There are relatively few areas on motorways just for trucks to stop at. Most designated rest areas are used by every sort of motor vehicle. On A roads (major routes which are made to a lower standard compared to motorways), a truck stop may have no refuelling facilities but simply offer a place for tired drivers to rest and/or get food and drink in a transport cafe. They may not be signposted well, if at all. United States Signage for Iowa 80, the world's largest truck stop. It is located in Walcott, Iowa. The truck stop originated in the United States in the 1940s as a reliable source of diesel fuel not commonly available at filling stations. This, coupled with the growth of the Interstate Highway System, led to the creation of the professional haulage and truck stop industries. They generally consist of, at the very least, a diesel grade fueling station with bays wide and tall enough for modern tractor/trailer rigs, plus a large enough parking area to accommodate from five to over a hundred trucks and other heavy vehicles. Truck stops should not be confused with rest areas or motorway service areas which cater mostly to cars and are often run by or leased from a government or tollway corporation. In the United States in the late 1990s, Truckstops of America (T/A) changed its name to TravelCenters of America to reflect this marketing strategy. There is no exact distinction between \\"truck stop\\" and the newer term \\"travel center\\", but some differences are size, proximity to interstate highways and major roads, the number of services, accessibility to automotive and RV travelers, and a certain extra emphasis on facility appearance. Many truck stops chains such as Love's, Flying J and T/A also serve the recreational vehicle market. All the national chains have established customer loyalty programs to promote repeated patronage. In Louisiana, truck stops that meet certain criteria are allowed to have on-site casinos that can operate up to 50 video poker gaming devices. These truck stops are regulated by the Louisiana Gaming Enforcement Division and must maintain certain amenities to be eligible to keep the lucrative gaming devices operating. Some of the amenities required are: having a certain number of acres of land, having a certain number of 18-wheeler parking spaces, having an on-site restaurant, and having trucker's supplies, showers, telephones, television lounge, scales, laundry services, fuel. Truck stops were often depicted in films and novels as being somewhat seedy places, frequented by aggressive bikers, petty criminals, and prostitutes (e.g. the \\"lot lizards\\" in the JT LeRoy novel Sarah). This may be an outdated stereotype, as most modern truck stops are generally clean and safe, becoming a \\"home away from home\\" for many truck drivers. However, most truck stops reflect the social environment of their local area; consequently, one occasionally finds seedy truck stops in seedy areas. According to John McPhee's book Uncommon Carriers, truck stops in rural areas are typically very safe and wholesome. However, as the distance to major cities decreases the incidence of prostitution, drug peddling etc. increases dramatically. The Vince Lombardi service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near New York City has the most rampant prostitution. p.87 Corporatization The economics of truck stops have driven most of the small, post-war operations out of business and they have been replaced with large corporate chains or franchises. Truck drivers are a captive market, because the trucks' size and local regulations place severe restrictions on where a truck driver can park. The initial investment in land, permits, equipment and maintenance requirements are large and growing: accordingly, some large truck stop chains have begun to cater to a wider range of the traveling public by combining trucks stops and traditional gas stations.

Origins  1960s Rockers under canopy outside Busy Bee Caf√©, Watford, England, UK Until the post-war period, motorcycling held a prestigious position and enjoyed a positive image in British society, being associated with wealth and glamour. Starting in the 1950s, the middle classes were able to buy inexpensive motorcars so that motorcycles became transport for the poor. The rocker subculture came about due to factors such as: the end of post-war rationing in the UK, a general rise in prosperity for working class youths, the recent availability of credit and financing for young people, the influence of American popular music and films, the construction of race track-like arterial roads around British cities, the development of transport cafes and a peak in British motorcycle engineering. The name \\"rocker\\" came not from music, but from the rockers found in 4-stroke engines, as opposed to the two stroke engines used by scooters and ridden by mods.

The public came to consider rockers as hopelessly naive, loutish, scruffy, motorized cowboys, loners or outsiders.Nuttall, Jeff. Bomb Culture Paladin, London 1969. pp. 27-29 The Rocker subculture was associated with 1950s and early-1960s rock and roll music by artists such as Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and Chuck Berry, music that George Melly called \\"screw and smash\\" music.  Caf√© racers  Triton motorcycle consisting of a Triumph twin-cylinder engine in a Norton Featherbed frame built in a street legal racer style with single seat, clip-on low handlebars and megaphone exhausts The term caf√© racer originated in the 1950s, when bikers often frequented transport caf√©s, using them as starting and finishing points for road races. A caf√© racer is a motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather than for comfort.The Caf√© Racer Phenomenon (Those were the days...), Alastair Walker. Veloce Publishing 2009. Features include: a single racing seat, low handlebars (such as ace bars or one-sided clip-ons mounted directly onto the front forks for control and aerodynamics), large racing petrol tanks (aluminium ones were often polished and left unpainted), swept-back exhaust pipes, rear-set footpegs (to give better clearance while cornering at high speeds) with or without half or full race fairings.Reg Everett and Mick Walker. Rocker to Racer. Breedon Books. 2010. These motorcycles were lean, light and handled various road surfaces well. The most defining machine of the rocker heyday was the Triton, which was a custom motorcycle made of a Norton Featherbed frame and a Triumph Bonneville engine. It used the most common and fastest racing engine combined with the best handling frame of its day.Seate, Mike. Caf√© Racer The Motorcycle: Featherbeds, Clip-ons, Rear-sets and the Making of a Ton-up Boy. Parker House (2008). Welte, Sabine, Cafe Racer. Bruckmann Verlag GmbH, 2008. Other popular motorcycle brands included BSA, Royal Enfield and Matchless. The term caf√© racers is now also used to describe motorcycle riders who prefer vintage British, Italian or Japanese motorbikes from the 1950s to late 1970s. These modern caf√© racers do not resemble the rockers of earlier decades, and they dress in a more modern and comfortable style, with only a hint of likeness to the rocker style, nor do they share the passion for 50s rock'n'roll. These modern caf√© racers have taken elements of the American greaser, British rocker, and modern motorcycle rider styles to create a look of their own.Clay, Mike. (1988) Cafe Racers: Rockers, Rock 'n' Roll and the Coffee-bar Cult. London: Osprey Publishing. Caf√© racers of the 1960s: machines, riders and lifestyle, Mick Walker. Crowood (1994) Rockers in the 2000s tend still to ride classic British motorcycles, however, classically styled European caf√© racers are now also seen, such as Moto Guzzi or Ducati, as well as classic Japanese bikes, some with British-made frames such as those made by Rickman.  Characteristics  Aviakit Pudding basin helmet Rockers bought standard factory-made motorcycles and stripped them down, tuning them up and modifying them to appear like racing bikes. Their bikes were not merely transport, but were used as an object of intimidation and masculinity projecting them uneasily close to death, an element exaggerated by their use of skull and crossbone-type symbolism. First seen in the United States and then England, the rocker fashion style was born out of necessity and practicality. Rockers wore heavily decorated leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with metal studs, patches, pin badges and sometimes an Esso gas man trinket. When they rode their motorcycles, they usually wore no helmet, or wore a classic open-face helmet, aviator goggles and a white silk scarf (to protect them from the elements). Other common items included: T-shirts, leather caps, Levi's or Wrangler jeans,Jeans: A Cultural History of an American Icon, James Sullivan, Gotham, 2006. leather trousers, tall motorcycle boots (often made by Lewis Leathers and Goldtop) or brothel creepers/beetle crushers. Also popular was a patch declaring membership of the 59 Club of England, a church-based youth organization that later formed into a motorcycle club with members all over the world. The rocker hairstyle, kept in place with Brylcreem, was usually a tame or exaggerated pompadour hairstyle, as was popular with some 1950s rock and roll musicians. Customised Lewis Leathers motorcycle jacket with Ace Cafe details Largely due to their clothing styles and dirtiness, the rockers were not widely welcomed by venues such as pubs and dance halls. Rockers also transformed rock and roll dancing into a more violent, individualistic form beyond the control of dance hall management. They were generally reviled by the British motorcycle industry and general enthusiasts as being as an embarrassment and bad for the industry and the sport.The Bsa Gold Star, Mick Walker. Redline Books, 2004 Originally, many rockers opposed recreational drug use, according to Johnny Stuart in 1987: > They had no knowledge of the different sorts of drugs. To them amphetamines, > cannabis, heroin were all drugs - something to be hated. Their ritual hatred > of Mods and other sub-cultures was based in part on the fact that these > people were believed to take drugs and were therefore regarded as sissies. > Their dislike of anyone connected with drugs was intense.Rockers! Kings of > the Road by John Stuart, Plexus Publishing Ltd. Cultural legacy Len Paterson, founder of the Rocker Reunion movement, left, Father Graham Hullet of the 59 Club, seated on motorcycle, at Enfield Motorcycles factory, UK The rockers' look and attitude influenced pop groups in the 1960s, such as The Beatles, as well as hard rock and punk rock bands and fans in the late 1970s. The look of the ton-up boy and rocker was accurately portrayed in the 1964 film The Leather Boys. The rocker subculture has also influenced the rockabilly revival and the psychobilly subculture. Many contemporary rockers still wear engineer boots or full-length motorcycle boots, but Winklepickers (sharp pointed shoes) are no longer common. Some wear brothel creepers (originally worn by Teddy Boys), or combat boots. Rockers have continued to wear leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with patches, studs, spikes and painted artwork; jeans or leather trousers; and white silk scarves. Leather caps adorned with metal studs and chains, common among rockers in the 1950s and 1960s, are rarely seen any more. Instead, some contemporary rockers wear a classic woollen flat cap. Rocker reunions In the early 1970s, the British rocker and hardcore motorcycle scene fractured and evolved under new influences coming from California: the hippies and the Hells Angels.Cookson, Brian (2006), Crossing the River, Edinburgh: Mainstream, , OCLC 63400905 The remaining rockers became known as greasers, and the scene had all but died out. In the early 1980s, a Rockers revival was started by Lennie Paterson and a handful of original rockers. Paterson organized rocker reunion dances called piss-ups, which attracted individuals from as far as Europe. The first rocker reunion motorcycle run of 30 classic British motorcycles rode to Battersea. Following runs went to other destinations with historic relevance to Rockers such as Brighton.

The region supplies about 40 percent of coal in the United States. It is both a topographic drainage and geologic structural basin. The basin is so named because it is drained by the Powder River, although it is also drained in part by the Cheyenne River, Tongue River, Bighorn River, Little Missouri River, Platte River, and their tributaries. While the Powder River Basin is unified geologically, residents of areas distant from the Powder River proper do not think of themselves as living in a single geographic region. For example, residents of the Crow Reservation in the Big Horn River watershed, or of Sheridan in the Tongue River watershed, would locate the Powder River Basin as the region east of the Big Horn Mountains, using a definition based on watershed and topography. Major cities in the area include Gillette and Sheridan, Wyoming and Miles City, Montana. Outside of these main towns, the area is very sparsely populated and is known for its rolling grasslands and semiarid climate. The former hunting grounds of the Oglala Lakota, it has become the single largest source of coal mined in the United States, and contains one of the largest deposits of coal in the world. Most of the active coal mining in the Powder River Basin actually takes place in drainages of the Cheyenne River. Because of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming has been the top coal-producing state in the United States since 1988. In 2007, the Powder River Basin alone produced 436 million short tons (396 million tonnes) of coal, more than twice the production of second-place West Virginia, and more than the entire Appalachian region. The Powder River Basin is the largest coal-producing region in the United States. The Black Thunder Coal Mine is one of the most productive coal mines in the United States; in 2006 this single mine produced 84 million metric tons of coal, more than any state except Wyoming, West Virginia, and Kentucky.E. Freme, Coal review, Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.52. The region is also a major producer of natural gas, both conventional natural gas and coal-bed methane.  Geologic history  Powder River Basin and surrounding uplifts (US Geological Survey) The Powder River Basin contains a section of Phanerozoic rocks up to thick, from Cambrian to Holocene. =Cretaceous= The thickest section of the Powder River Basin is composed of Cretaceous rocks, an overall regressive sequence of mostly marine shales and sandstones deposited in the Western Interior Seaway. =Tertiary= The coal beds of the region began to form about 60 million years ago when the land began rising from a shallow sea. The rise of the Black Hills uplift on the east and the Hartville uplift on the southeast side of the basin created the present outline of the Powder River Basin. When the coal beds were forming, the climate in the area was subtropical, averaging about of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the basin floor was covered with lakes and swamps. Because of the large area of the swamps, the organic material accumulated into peat bogs instead of being washed to the sea. Periodically the layers of peat were covered with sediments washed in from nearby mountains. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The basin filled with sediment and buried the peat under thousands of feet, compressing the layers of peat and forming coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, leaving the coal seams near the surface. Coal Northeast view of the mile wide Decker coal mine and the Tongue River in the Powder River Basin, southeastern Montana. Coal stratigraphy of the Powder River Basin (USGS) More coal is produced in the Powder River Basin than any other area in the US Powder River Basin (PRB) coal is classified as \\"sub-bituminous\\" and contains an average of approximately 8,500 btu/lb, with low sulfur. Contrast this with eastern, Appalachian bituminous coal containing an average of 12,500 btu/lb and high sulfur. PRB coal was essentially worthless until air pollution emissions from power plants (primarily sulfur dioxide, or \\"SO2\\") became a concern. A coal- fired plant designed to burn Appalachian coal must be modified to remove SO2 at a cost estimated in 1999 to be around $322 per ton of SO2. If it switched to burning PRB coal, the cost dropped to $113 per ton of SO2 removed. Removal is accomplished by installing scrubbers.PRB Coal Properties. Cba-ssd.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. The Powder River Basin is the largest coal mining region in the United States, but most of the coal is buried too deeply to be economically accessible., page ix The Powder River Basin coal beds are shaped like elongated bowls and as mines expand from east to west in the Powder River Basin, they will be going \\"down the sides of the bowl\\". This means that the overburden (rock lying over the coal) will increase as will the stripping ratio (the ratio of rock that needs to be moved to get to a ton of coal). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted a series of studies on the economic accessibility of coal in the major coal-producing regions of the country. The studies have typically found that only a small fraction of the coal will be economically accessible at the current price of $10.47/ton. In August 2008, the USGS issued an updated assessment of coal in the Powder River Basin. After considering stripping ratios and production costs, the USGS concluded that at the time of the economic evaluation, only 6 percent of the original resource, or 10.1 billion short tons of coal, was currently economically recoverable. At a price of $60/ton, roughly half (48%) of the coal is economic to produce. Presently the approximately 15 mines in the Powder River Basin are working in areas where the stripping ratio is between 1:1 (i.e. one ton of rock for one ton of coal) and 3:1.Luppens, Scott, Haacke, Osmonson, Rohrbacher, Ellis: Figure 62 As the mines expand the stripping ratio will increase. As more rock needs to be moved (using large electrically powered draglines and diesel and electric mining trucks) the production cost will also increase.Luppens, Scott, Haacke, Osmonson, Rohrbacher, Ellis: Page 25 and Table 4 The United States uses about 1 billion tons of coal a year, with about 40 percent of the coal currently coming from the Powder River Basin. The amount of coal coming from the Powder River Basin has been increasing over the last 20 years. Increasing the price paid for coal can increase the amount of economically recoverable coal, but increasing the price of coal will also increase the production cost for the coal. In addition, because coal is a solid, not a liquid, it cannot be produced from many scattered wells as oil and gas can be. Rather, coal has to be produced from mines that expand slowly by moving massive quantities of overburden. The mines in the Powder River Basin typically have less than 20 years of life remaining. Almost all of the coal in the Powder River Basin is federally owned and further mine expansions will require a series of federal and state approvals,Cfodocs Redirect - Do Not Delete . Blm.gov (2013-03-18). Retrieved on 2013-07-12. as well as large investments in additional mine equipment to begin the excavations. The majority of the coal mined in the Powder River Basin is part of the Fort Union Formation (Paleocene), with the low sulfur and ash content of the coal in the region making it very desirable. Coal supplies about a third of the United States' electricity supplies, with the Powder River Basin mines supplying around 40 percent of the coal that fuels those stations, mainly to the east of the Rocky Mountains, for generating electricity.Rails cause utility fuel shortages, electricity rate hike Rail Cure ‚Äì August 2005 In 2013, five coal export terminals were being proposed in the Pacific Northwest to export coal from the Powder River Basin to Asian markets. As of February 2016, some coal terminal proposals had been withdrawn, leaving two still applied for. The withdrawals were ascribed to loss of demand and consequent lower coal prices.\\"What coal's decline means for Northwest export markets,\\" Oregon Public Broadcasting, 17 Feb. 2016.

Petroleum =Oil and gas= The Powder River Basin also contains major deposits of petroleum, including the giant Salt Creek Oil Field. The oil and gas are produced from rocks ranging from Pennsylvanian to Tertiary, but most comes from sandstones in the thick section of Cretaceous rocks.Gordon L. Dolton, James E. Fox, and Jerry L. Clayton, (1990) Petroleum Geology of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming and Montana, US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 88-450 P. There is a recent resurgence in oil and gas production as a result of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This resurgence is occurring mainly in the Wyoming portion of the basin, which is historically known as the source of the basin's oil. In 2009, a low of 38,000 barrels of oil per day were produced in the basin. That number has risen dramatically to 78,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2014.

In the last decade, nearly 7000 such wells have been drilled. An extensive network of gas pipelines connecting these wells has been built, along with a series of pressurization plants, as well as power lines to provide electricity to operate the system. In addition, thousands of miles of new access roads have been constructed. Extracting the gas requires that water be pumped to the surface to release gas trapped in the coal seam. While some of the water is successfully utilized in agriculture production such as livestock water and crop irrigation, some waters are naturally high in salinity and sodium adsorption ratio. There has been controversy on how to best manage these saline waters. In 2007, Powder River Basin coalbed field produced 442 billion cubic feet of gas, making the field the 3rd largest source of natural gas in the United States.US Energy Information Administration, Top 100 oil and gas fields , PDF file, retrieved 18 February 2009. Uranium The region also contains major deposits of uranium, contained in sandstones. (See Uranium mining in Wyoming). The Wasatch Formation (Eocene) contains the uranium ore \\"roll front\\" type deposits found in the Pumpkin Buttes District. Cameco Corporation subsidiary Power Resources Inc. operates uranium mines in the basin. Transportation In Spring 2005, coal extracted from the mines would retail at the mines for around $5 a ton. However, power stations and plants in the eastern United States were paying over $30 a ton ‚Äì the difference caused by the cost of transportation. (In October 2008, the mine-mouth price of Powder River Basin coal was closer to $15 per ton.) To transport coal from the basin, there is a joint railway line owned by the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad running the length of the southern section of the Powder River Basin.Trains on the High Plains (VHS video) . Pentrex.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. A third railroad, the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, faced strong resistance from many parties for its attempts to extend its rail line into the coal mining area, but while the plan was eventually approved by regulating authorities, the project was abandoned after the railroad was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway. =History= Originally a single track Burlington Northern Railway line built in stages from 1972 to 1979, the rail line ran south from Donkey Creek Junction in the north to Caballo, Wyoming; and then for to Shawnee in Converse County.PRB Coal Update: BNSF Completes Third Main Track on Joint Line BNSF News ‚Äì 5 November 2007 The Chicago and North Western Railway ran close to the northern section, as did the Union Pacific at Caballo. In 1982 C&NW; and the UP formed Western Railroad Properties, Inc. (WRPI), to acquire half interest in the Burlington Northern coal line from Shawnee Junction to Coal Creek Junction. On December 15, 1986 WPRI purchased more of BN line from Coal Creek Junction to East Caballo Junction. Beginning June 27, 1983 WPRI constructed of new railroad from Shawnee Junction. to Shawnee, rebuilt of C&NW; line from Shawnee to Crandall and of new railroad from Crandall to Joyce, Nebraska. The first commercial train ran on August 16, 1984. By 1985, the line was single track for almost its entire length, and it was handling 19 million tons of coal. The implementation of the second stage of the Clean Air Act (1990) caused demand for clean coal to rise quickly. The C&NW; struggled to upgrade capacity to dual track, resulting in numerous failures on the line in 1994, and eventually Union Pacific's purchase of C&NW; in 1995.Western, Burlington Northern and Union Pacific railroads Railway Age ‚Äì October 1994 The UP spent 855 million dollars over the next five years expanding capacity over its entire network to handle coal shipments from the PRB.UP will expand PRB coal lines Railway Age ‚Äì Nov, 1996 By 2005 the Joint Line capacity had grown to handle an all-time record 325 million tons, and was either dual or three track capacity for its entire length. Due to various trackage and locomotive failures on the Joint Line in late 2004 and early 2005, the line failed to deliver the amount of contracted coal supplies, and electricity rates increased by 15 percent. Coal customers threatened to evaluate alternate sources of energy and transportation, including the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation. As a result, the expansion of the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad line was approved by the Surface Transportation Board. In 2006 UP and BNSF announced a $100 million investment to provide three track capacity for the entire length of the Joint Line plus a fourth track added over the steepest sections, including Logan Hill. These improvements will enable the Joint Line to handle over 400 million tons of coal. In 2006, Union Pacific set a record by hauling 194 million tons of coal ‚Äì an 8% increase compared with 2005 tonnage. The company achieved this by increasing train size, with trains averaging more than 15,000 tons, a 200-ton weight increase compared with fourth-quarter 2005's average. In early 2016 it was reported that 80 to 100 trains of coal were being shipped from the Powder river basin every day. In 2019 train loadings averaged about 50 per day.

History =Application for 92.9= The station was first licensed in 2005 with the call sign CKNS-FM. The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission approved the application for a station serving Haldimand, but assigned the frequency for which the station initially applied, 106.7 FM, to another station in a nearby market (CIKZ).Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2005-169 Bel-Roc Communications then applied for 92.9, from a transmitter location approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the original, at lower effective radiated power, but from a higher tower. A contemporaneous competing application from CHCD in nearby Simcoe, Ontario sought the adjacent frequency, 93.1, for a CHCD repeater in Haldimand. CHCD alleged that while the parameters proposed for 106.7 would have put a signal into Hamilton, Ontario sufficient to stay with Haldimand-to-Hamilton commuters and let the station to draw on revenues from the Hamilton radio market, those now proposed for 92.9 would put inadequate signals not only into Hamilton, but into much of Haldimand itself. CHCD contested the station could only survive on advertising revenue from Simcoe and Norfolk County, even in spite a condition of license barring it from soliciting local advertising in Simcoe (and also nearby Brantford). Individually, CIWV (now CHKX-FM) in Hamilton and Standard Broadcasting, owners of CKLH, CKOC and CHAM in Hamilton, also opposed the application. They contended that the proposed signal into Haldimand was indeed impaired, but that the signal into the Hamilton area was actually significantly increased. Standard argued that CKNS would no longer focus uniquely on the Haldimand community; for a time in 2005, the proposed station's own website branded it a \\"Haldimand/Hamilton\\" station. CIWV - originally co-founded by Rae Roe, who had since sold his stake and gone on to co-found CKNS - suggested that CKNS perhaps be barred from soliciting advertising in Hamilton as well. In response to these interventions, Bel-Roc agreed that they planned to solicit advertising in Hamilton, but insisted they would focus on Haldimand listeners; they disputed other details of the opposing interventions, and argued that the new parameters were necessary to meet Industry Canada requirements regulating the use of the broadcast spectrum. The CRTC approved CKNS' application for 92.9, and denied CHCD's for 93.1 FM.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2005-596 This caused significant signal degradation for WBUF, the nearest station on 92.9, across the border in Buffalo, New York. The application proposed a unique multi-genre Canadian format including a minimum 60% fully qualified Canadian content as defined by CRTC regulations. The balance of music would contain Canadian elements. This percentage was selected to enable the station to play popular music by Canadian artists that does not qualify under present rules as Canadian content. The proposed format was inspired by Internet radio station LG73,LG73 Internet radio station from Vancouver which is in turn inspired by, and an unofficial tribute to, the former Vancouver broadcast station CKLG, when it was an AM station under that brand. CKLG was never exclusively or overwhelmingly devoted to Canadian content as the Internet station or the proposed Haldimand station. Bel-Roc suggested that they would eventually apply to rebroadcast the station on available frequencies in many other Canadian cities. =Launch= After several weeks of \\"test\\" broadcasting, CKNS 92.9 FM \\"officially\\" went on the air at 6:00 a.m. on May 15, 2006, with an adult hits format.

He performed on radio, in movies, and on television from the 1930s thru the 1980s. He was noted for his work with Gene Autry and Bing Crosby and especially for singing \\"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\\", the theme song to the 1960s sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies.  Biography  Scoggins was born in Mount Pleasant, Texas in 1911. He sang and played guitar on Dallas radio stations in the early 1930s and in 1936 formed his own group, the Cass County Kids, with John Dodson and Fred Martin. Ten years later in 1946, country musician and cowboy Gene Autry changed their name to the Cass County Boys when he hired them to work on his Melody Ranch radio program. They appeared in 17 of his films and worked with him on radio and TV for 12 years while also appearing with Bing Crosby on early 1950s TV. In 1996 the Boys were inducted into Western Music Hall of Fame. They also received a Golden Boot Award from the Motion Picture and Television Fund. In 1962, Scoggins was working as a stockbroker and singing on weekends when he was asked to sing the theme song for a new sitcom, called The Beverly Hillbillies. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo while he sang the lyrics. \\"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\\" was a smash hit on the charts, with Flatt singing on the single. In 1993, a retired Scoggins learned that 20th Century Fox was making a film version of the series. He called their offices only to be told that they'd had no idea he was still alive. The studio preferred Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson to sing the theme song, but the director, Penelope Spheeris, insisted on Scoggins getting the job, which he did. He figured he'd probably sung the ballad over 1,000 times since the original recording. Scoggins appeared on-camera, singing the ballad, in the 1993 TV special, The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies.

He became known for asking \\"softball\\" questions (i.e. inoffensive questions which praise the sitting government, and allow ministers to outline new policy initiatives). Galt was re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, though by only 903 votes over Liberal Carolyn Campbell. He introduced a resolution in the Legislature to bring forward greater protection against cruelty to animals and tried to ban riding in the back of pick-up trucks. Galt also introduced a Private Member's Bill to create a Robert Baldwin Day in Ontario which was later endorsed by Andrew Redden in an article published in the Canadian Parliamentary Review. In 2000, Galt precipitated a minor crisis in the legislature by accidentally reading out the names of certain young offenders, whose identities were protected by law. Galt was actually praising the young offenders for graduating from a young offenders program while forgetting that they were still young offenders. Rob Sampson, the Minister of Correctional Services, had to temporarily resign from office to show ministerial accountability for Galt's error. Galt served as chair of the Premier's Task Force on Rural Economic Renewal, which toured the province and consulted with other jurisdictions. Amongst other initiatives, the findings of this Task Force led to the creation of the O.S.T.A.R. program and Rural Economic Development funding initiative. Galt supported Ernie Eves to replace Harris as party leader in 2002, and was named by Eves as a minister without portfolio and chief government Whip on August 22 of that year. The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, and Galt lost his seat to Liberal candidate Lou Rinaldi by approximately 2,500 votes. =Cabinet positions= =Federal politics= In early 2004, Galt supported Tony Clement's unsuccessful campaign to become leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. Galt himself ran as a Conservative in the 2004 federal election, challenging Liberal incumbent Paul Macklin in the federal riding of Northumberland. Macklin defeated Galt by 313 votes.

In 1832, the Anglo-American settlers were involved in a conflict with Mexican commander John Davis Bradburn (also an Anglo-American) near the northern extent of Galveston Bay. The settlers were opposed to control of their daily affairs by the centralist government. They were primarily at odds with the administration over the subject of tariffs on imports and exports and over the presence of conscripted criminals in the Mexican garrison, whom the colonists blamed for a number of local crimes. The simmering conflict reached a head when Bradburn took in two escaped slaves from Louisiana. Though slavery was officially illegal in Mexico, the Mexican authorities wanted to encourage Anglo-American colonization of the frontier and tolerated indentured servants for ten years, among the colonists. Among that population included three slaves who escaped from Louisiana and were given asylum by Bradburn. Two local lawyers, William B. Travis and Patrick C. Jack, attempted to repatriate the freed slaves to their American owner but were arrested after they had forged a letter to Bradburn threatening armed intervention from Louisiana militia.Margaret Swett Henson, \\"ANAHUAC DISTURBANCES,\\" Handbook of Texas Online and, accessed March 12, 2012. The Anglo militia skirmished with Bradburn's troops before retreating north to the crossing on Turtle Bayou near James Taylor White's ranch house to await the arrival of artillery. The settlers received word that the anti-administration Federalist army had won a significant victory under the leadership of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Colonists react Turtle Bayou Resolutions historical marker Taking advantage of this favorable news, they verbally aligned themselves with the Federalist cause by composing the Turtle Bayou Resolutions, which explained their attack against the Centralist troops at Anahuac. They explained that they were not lawless Anglos attacking a Mexican garrison, but that they were Federalist sympathizers opposing a Centralist commandant as part of the civil war that had been in progress for two years between the Centralist administration of Anastasio Bustamante and those wanting to return to the Federalist Constitution of 1824.Margaret Swett Henson, \\"TURTLE BAYOU RESOLUTIONS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed March 12, 2012. The four resolutions condemned violations of the 1824 constitution by the Bustamante government and urged all Texans to support the patriots fighting under Santa Anna, who was at the time struggling to defeat military despotism. Though opinions varied among the colonists, few Texans were at that time willing to urge secession. Federalist colonel Jos√© Antonio Mex√≠a arrived in Brazoria, Texas, on July 16, 1832, with 400 troops and five ships to quell a supposed movement to sever Texas from Mexico. A copy of the Turtle Bayou Resolutions was included in the seven-point statement of causes for taking up arms that was presented to Mex√≠a on July 18. The explanations offered by the Texas leaders satisfied the Federalist general, and he returned to the Rio Grande. The document No signatures are affixed to the extant copy of the resolutions themselves, but seven of the Texas leaders (Wyly Martin, John Austin, Luke Lesassier, William H. Jack, Hugh B. Johnston, Francis W. Johnson, and Robert M. Williamson) signed the combined document presented to Mex√≠a. The document was published in an extra edition of the Brazoria Constitutional Advocate on July 23, 1832, and appeared in Mary Austin Holley's Texas (1833). Text of the Turtle Bayou Resolutions http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/consultations1.htm First: By their repeated violations of the constitution and laws and the total disregard of the civil and political rights of the people. Second: Jose G Granado fixing and establishing among us, in the time of peace, military posts, the officers of which, totally disregarding the local civil authorities of the State, have committed various acts evincing opposition to the true interest of the people in the enjoyment of civil liberty. Third: By arresting the commissioners, especially Juan Francisco Madero, who, on the part of the State government, was to put the inhabitants east of Trinity River in possession of other lands, in conformity with the laws of colonization. Fourth: By the imposition of military force, preventing the Alcalde of the jurisdiction of Liberty from the exercise of his constitutional functions. Fifth: By appointing to the revenue department of Galveston, a man whose character for infamy had been clearly established, and made known to the Government, and whose principles are avowedly to the true interest of the people of Texas; and that, too, when their character for infamy had been repeatedly established. Sixth: By the military commandant of Anahuac advising and procuring servants to quit the service of their masters, and offering them protection; causing them to labor for his benefits, and refusing to compensate them for the same. Seventh: By imprisonment of our citizens without lawful cause; and claiming the right of trying said citizens by a military court for offense of a character cognizable by the civil authority alone. RESOLVED That we view with feelings of the deepest regret, Tori Tercero manner in which the Government of the Republic of Mexico is administered by the present dynasty - The repeated violations of the constitution - the total disregard for the law - the entire prostration of the civil authority; and the substitution in the stead of military despotism, are grievances of such a character, as to arouse the feelings of every freeman, and impel him to resistance. RESOLVED That we view with feelings of deepest interest and solicitude, the firm and manly resistance which is made by those patriots under the highly and distinguished chieftain Santa Anna, to the numerous encroachments and infractions which have been made by the present administration upon the laws and constitution of our beloved and adopted country. RESOLVED That as freemen devoted to a correct interpretation and enforcement of the Constitution, and laws, according to their true Spirit - We pledge our lives and fortunes in support of the same, and of the distinguished leader, who is now gallantly fighting in defence of Civil Liberty. RESOLVED That all the people of Texas be united to co-operate with us, in support of the principles incorporated in the foregoing resolutions.

She was nominated for British Female Solo Artist at the 2007 BRIT Awards and nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for \\"Sophia\\" in the category of 'Best Song (musically and lyrically)' in the same year. Besides her own material, Pallot has written songs for Kylie Minogue and Diana Vickers. She mostly tours around the UK and is married to record producer Andy Chatterley. Early life Pallot was born in London and brought up in Jersey by a half-French father and a mother from Prayag, India, together with her sister. Pallot played piano as a child and wrote her first song aged 13. She has identified seeing singer and pianist Kate Bush perform her hit song \\"This Woman's Work\\" on television series Wogan as a catalyst for her to pursue a music career. She attended Jersey College for Girls and received a music scholarship for Wellington College. Career =2001‚Äì03: Dear Frustrated Superstar= Pallot released her debut album, Dear Frustrated Superstar, on Polydor records in August 2001.Listing for the Dear Frustrated Superstar album on DIscogs.com, (accessed 12 January 2015). This spawned two singles, \\"Patience\\" and \\"Alien\\". She was subsequently dropped from the label mainly due to failing sales. The album was eventually re-issued several years later after her second album, Fires had become a commercial success. Her then-manager Richard Ogden noted that his company spent \\"three years managing her while she had a huge record deal and was a massive priority for Polydor. We did the best job we possibly could, but it just didn‚Äôt happen\\". In 2003 she sang lead vocals on the track \\"Truly\\" on Delerium's album Chimera, which was also released as a single in the UK.Listing of the Chimera album on Discogs.com, (accessed 12 January 2015). =2004‚Äì08: Fires= Her second album, Fires, was released in April 2005 on her own independent label, Idaho. It was published by Chrysalis Music Publishing, to whom she remained signed and provided her with a development deal. They initially provided her with ¬£50,000 to make the album. When that proved insufficient for Pallot's needs, she remortgaged her house to complete the rest of the album. The album was produced and mixed by Howard Willing together with producers Eric Rosse who produced \\"Learning to Breathe\\" and \\"Heart Attack\\" (co-produced by Willing) and Wendy Melvoin who produced \\"Damascus\\". After the initial tracks were finished the rest of the record was apparently completed by Willing and Pallot flying files back and forth from London to Los Angeles. The album was preceded by a download-only single, \\"Everybody's Gone to War\\". A second single from the record, \\"Damascus\\" was released in June 2005, and a third, \\"All Good People\\" (a Radio 2 single of the week) was released in September 2005. She performed at the 2005 Guildfest music festival and headlined her own show at Bush Hall in Shepherd's Bush, London later that year. At the end of 2005, Pallot signed with 14th Floor Records (a Warner label), who re-issued the album after adding strings on some tracks, on 24 April 2006, earning Pallot a chart success by reaching Number 21. With over 100,000 sales it was certified gold in the UK.Certified Awards BPI - British Recorded Music Industry, 9 June 2006 The first single from the revamped album was \\"Everybody's Gone to War\\", which was playlisted on most major British radio stations. The single became the third most played song on British radio the week before its release, and reached Number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. She undertook her first full headlining tour in support of the Fires album in May 2006. During the year she also played headline shows in London at ICA, the Bloomsbury Theatre, Regent's Park Open Air Theatre and at Shepherd's Bush Empire. The second single from the album was \\"Sophia\\", a re- recorded version, created in LA along with producer Mitchell Froom, entered the UK singles chart at Number 32. In April 2007, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award, while she toured around the UK and Ireland in January and February of that year. The next single from the re-released version of Fires was \\"Learning to Breathe\\", which reached Number 70 in the UK singles chart. =2009‚Äì2010: The Graduate= Pallot worked with several big name co- writers in preparation for the follow-up to Fires, including Linda Perry (Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\") and Rob Davis (Kylie Minogue's \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\"). She also wrote an album's worth of material with Rick Nowels (Madonna's \\"Power of Goodbye\\", Belinda Carlisle's \\"Heaven Is A Place on Earth\\"). However, she struggled with the co-writing process and in the end only self-written songs made the album. The Graduate was released on 5 October 2009 in the UK and reached number 46 in the Official UK Album Chart in its first week of release. The standard version of the album features 10 original tracks, whereas the iTunes version contains three additional tracks, and the deluxe version contains seven acoustic versions of the tracks. The album has polarised critics, with some lauding it as her best album yet and others seeing her change of direction from Fires as a mistake. Having had no intention of releasing Fires 2, Pallot has defended the need for a progression between the two records. She toured the UK in October 2009, including a performance at Glasgow's Oran Mor venue on Wednesday 7 October, showcasing songs from the new album The Graduate. =2011‚Äì13: Year of the Wolf= In July 2010, Pallot returned to Geffen Records and to the A&R; that first signed her to Polydor while embarking on an eight-day tour around the UK and Ireland. She confirmed her new album would be titled Year of the Wolf via her Twitter page on 21 January 2011. She recorded with Bernard Butler for the album. The lead single was \\"Put Your Hands Up\\", released 24 April, while the album was released 13 June 2011. =2014: Year of the EPs= For her next project, Pallot decided to release an EP every month in 2014, as she 'just got sick of the album, tour, single... that whole cycle'. The first was called 'The Hold Tight' in January, followed by 'We Should Break Up' in February. She found that 'I'm at a point in my career where I can pretty much make it up now. I‚Äôve also realised that a true fan base [...] cares about hearing as much music as they can get their hands on\\". Pallot supported the releases with a handful of tour dates across the UK.

Her first video for \\"Patience\\", directed by Swedish director Emma Hvengaard, features Pallot in various scenes, notably wearing white and barefoot, continually floating to and from earth. \\"Alien\\" begins with Pallot lying down, it then becomes apparent that she had fallen onto a plumber's van, crushing it, and the video implies she has fallen from the sky \\"like an alien\\". The unreleased \\"If I Know You\\" video features multiple Nerinas fighting each other in a theatre. For \\"Damascus\\", Pallot is seen playing piano and singing in a recording studio. Pallot's next video was for \\"Everybody's Gone to War\\", which includes cabbage-throwing goths and pineapple bombs. Her next video was for \\"Sophia\\", and was filmed in the middle of the desert in Morocco. It has Pallot sitting at a piano, playing and singing while fire surrounds her in a circle and her piano smokes and is also alight. Nerina's next performance, \\"Learning To Breathe\\", is more \\"abstract\\" and is computer-generated with her playing the guitar in a house with many pictures decorating the walls. The video for \\"Put Your Hands Up\\", the lead single from Year of the Wolf, was shot in and around Lant Street in Southwark, London. =Songwriting and production= *Pallot along with her husband Andy Chatterley wrote and produced two songs for Aphrodite, the 2010 album by Kylie Minogue, the title track \\"Aphrodite\\" and third single \\"Better than Today\\", which first appeared on Nerina's \\"Buckminster Fuller\\" EP from 2009. *Pallot wrote and co-produced \\"Put It Back Together\\" for Diana Vickers from her debut album Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree, Vickers performed 'Put It Back Together' as a special guest at Pallot's live concert at Union Chapel in Islington, north London, on 28 April 2010. *Nerina's \\"Real Late Starter\\" was covered by 2009 X Factor UK winner Joe McElderry for his debut album, Wide Awake, released on 25 October 2010. *In 2010, she co-wrote a song with Brazilian singer Sandy, called \\"Dias Iguais\\" - from Sandy's solo studio album Manuscrito. =Notable events= *'Record of the Week' on BBC Radio 1 *A spot on Top of the Pops *An appearance on BBC One's Heaven and Earth with Gloria Hunniford on 18 June 2006 *A cover story in The Times magazine (see link below) *An appearance on The Charlotte Church Show on 29 September 2006 *An appearance on Children in Need 2006 broadcast 18 November 2006 *Pallot featured in Asian Woman magazine.

M. W. Turner The Tristia (\\"Sorrows\\" or \\"Lamentations\\") is a collection of letters written in elegiac couplets by the Augustan poet Ovid during his exile from Rome. Despite five books of his copious bewailing of his fate, the immediate cause of Augustus's banishment of the most acclaimed living Latin poet to Pontus in AD 8 remains a mystery. In addition to the Tristia, Ovid wrote another collection of elegiac epistles on his exile, the Epistulae ex Ponto. He spent several years in the outpost of Tomis and died without ever returning to Rome. The Tristia was once viewed unfavorably in Ovid's oeuvre but has become the subject of scholarly interest in recent years. The poems The first volume was written during Ovid's journey into exile. It addresses his grieving wife, his friends ‚Äî both the faithful and the false ‚Äî and his past works, especially the Metamorphoses. Ovid describes his arduous travel to the furthest edge of the empire, giving him a chance to draw the obligatory parallels with the exiles of Aeneas and Odysseus (Ulysses) and excuse his work's failings. The introduction and dedication, which caution the departing volume against the dangers of its destination, were probably written last. The second volume takes the form of a plea to Augustus to end the unhappy exile brought about by the famous carmen et error‚Äîthe nature of the mistake is never made clear, although some speculate it may have had something to do with Ovid's overhearing (or rather discovery) of the adulterous nature of Augustus' daughter, Julia. He defends his work and his life with equal vigor, appealing to the many poets who had written on the same themes as he‚Äîamong them Anacreon, Sappho, Catullus and even Homer. The plea was unsuccessful; Ovid would live out the remainder of his years in exile among the Thracian Getae. The last three books of the Tristia grow grimmer as their author ages, heavy with the knowledge that he will never return to his home. At one point he even composes his epitaph: :I who lie here, sweet Ovid, poet of tender passions, ::fell victim to my own sharp wit. :Passer-by, if you've ever been in love, don't grudge me ::the traditional prayer: 'May Ovid's bones lie soft!'Tristia 3.3.73-76: hic ego qui iaceo tenerorum lusor amorum / ingenio perii Naso poeta meo; / at tibi qui transis ne sit graue quisquis amasti / dicere \\"Nasonis molliter ossa cubent\\"; translation by Peter Green, The Poems of Exile: Tristia and the Black Sea Letters (University of California Press, 2005), p. 46. The last part of the book addresses Ovid's wife, praising her loyalty throughout his years of exile and wishing that she be remembered for as long as his books are read. Critical reception Peter Green wrote in a translation of Ovid's exile poems that the Tristia \\"[has] not, on the whole, had a good press from posterity.\\" Gordon Willis Williams referred to the work as \\"mostly a pale reflection of the genius that he had been.\\" However, Ralph J. Hexter wrote in 1995 that literary critics were then \\"beginning to give the exile elegies a fresh look.\\" A number of scholars have since viewed the collection favorably. It is listed among Ovid's major works by author David Malouf and scholar Matthew Woodcock. In Matthew Bunson's Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire, it is called \\"a powerful plea for justice.\\" References Bibliography *Ovid and His Influence; Rand, Edward Kennard (Boston, Marshall Jones Company, 1925) External links * Tristia.

For most of the 20th century this was done using brushes and dyes which were then used as guides to produce the printing plates. Since the late 20th century it is most often done using digital media, with printing separations produced electronically. Although most American colorists work directly for comics publishers (either as employees or freelancers), there are a few coloring studios which offer their services to publishers. American Color, Olyoptics, Digital Chameleon were the companies notable in this field.  History  Originally, comics were colored by cutting out films of various densities in the appropriate shapes to be used in producing color-separated printing plates. The typical colorist worked from photocopies of the inked pages, which they colored with special dyes. Dr. Martin's Dyes was a brand notable in this field within the comic strip industry. CMYK codes were written on the page to indicate the final printed colors, and these hand-colored pages were used as guides by the engraver.\\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel Two-in-One #52 (Marvel Comics, June 1979). Tatjana Wood was the main colorist for DC Comics' covers from 1973 through the mid-1980s. More recently, colorists have worked in transparent media such as watercolors or airbrush, which is then photographed, allowing more subtle and painterly effects. Digital color Colorist Steve Oliff and his company Olyoptics were one of the first to use computers to do color separations. Although other companies at the time were experimenting with computers, Oliff and his crew were the first to blend the color guide artist with the separator.Khoury, George. Image Comics: The Road To Independence (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007). https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=xjVEjumBEIgC&pg;=PA177&lpg;=PA177&dq;=akira+digital+coloring&source;=bl&ots;=nt7gmV9Kif&sig;=ACfU3U2IpHO_7NSokcIv2e2JhWu0Wpn4fA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiG0_Dmg7_qAhUuWN8KHZRMAJ4Q6AEwEHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=akira%20digital%20coloring&f;=false In 1987, the Japanese manga Akira was in preparation to be translated and published by Marvel Comics's Epic Comics line. Oliff was chosen as the colorist, and he convinced Marvel that it was time to try computer color.Gravett, Paul. Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics (Laurence King Publishing, 2004). After the publication of Akira in 1988, computer coloring became increasingly prevalent in the comics industry. By the early 1990s, even though the larger comics publishers were using computers, there were variations within the field. DC Comics allowed only a 64-color palette, while Marvel had expanded it to 125 colors. Dark Horse Comics allowed even more variations.Hollingsworth, Matt. \\"Color Guides,\\" MattHollingsworth.net. Accessed Apr. 6, 2009. The dominant programs in use during that time were Color Prep and Tint Prep, both originally implemented by Olyoptics. This software was invented and written by \\"Pixel Craft\\", the first company to create software that used a personal computer that could output files for a digital image setter to make negatives for color printing. Pixel craft was a small company in Long Island, NY, created by Kenneth Giordano, and Khouri Giordano. The Father and son team went on to accomplish many first in the computerization of color print. In 1993, Image Comics' use of computer color and more advanced color separation technology propelled DC and Marvel to further upgrade their coloring techniques. Finally, in the mid-1990s, Digital Chameleon's facility with Adobe Photoshop helped make that program the industry standard. The improvements in the technology used for coloring have had a great impact on the way comics are drawn. Before the use of computers, artists would often use the pen or brush to put in detailed shading effects; now the artist is more likely to leave the drawing open and leave it to the colorist to insert shading through variation in color tones or through adding a layer of translucent black. Most contemporary colorists work in digital media using tools.Sierra, Jerry A. \\"Digital Chameleon Colors The Vertigo Universe - Part Two,\\" Publish (July 1994). Accessed Apr. 6, 2009.

Set in France during the first half of the 20th century, the film concerns a poor and illiterate man named Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who is introduced to Victor Hugo's classic 1862 novel Les Mis√©rables and begins to see parallels to his own life. The film won the 1995 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot As the film opens, Henri's father, a chauffeur, is falsely accused of having murdered his boss. During his trial and imprisonment, Henri's mother finds a job in a tavern on a Normandy beach. There Henri sees a film adaptation of Les Mis√©rables. His father dies attempting to escape from prison, and upon hearing the news Henri's mother commits suicide. Henri grows up an orphan and learns boxing. The film next takes up the story of Elisa, a ballerina, and Andr√© Ziman, a young Jewish journalist and law student. They meet following a performance of a ballet based on Les Mis√©rables. Later, during World War II, Andr√© and Elisa, now married, and their daughter Salom√© attempt to cross the Swiss border to escape the Nazis. They encounter Henri, who owns a moving company, and they discuss the Hugo novel. The Zimans entrust Salom√© to Henri and enroll her in a Catholic convent school. Andr√© and Elisa are ambushed while trying to cross the frontier. Elisa is arrested and Andr√© wounded. Farmers who find him give him shelter. Henri and the members of a local gang join the French Resistance, but the gang members take advantage of their anti-Nazi attacks to steal from local houses. Elisa and other women are forced to entertain the Nazi occupiers. She is sent to a concentration camp for being defiant. After staging an attack on a train transporting funds for the Vichy government, Henri and his mates travel to Normandy to visit the tavern where he lived as a child. The D-Day invasion is launched the next day and Henri supports the Allied forces when they conquer the beach. In the process he saves the life of the tavern owner's son Marius. At the war's end, Henri accepts an offer to run a seaside camp in Normandy. There he receives a letter from Salom√©, who has no way of contacting her family. He takes her with him to the resort, which he names Chez Jean Valjean. Elisa, having survived a Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, joins them later. A former Vichy police agent accuses Henri of abetting the gang's activities during the war and of robbing and burning a train. He is imprisoned to await trial. Meanwhile Andr√©'s one-time rescuer is holding him captive, hoping to live off his bank account. The farmer has told Andr√© that the American D-Day invasion failed and the Nazis now rule the world. With evident reluctance, the farmer's wife support her husband in these lies until he attempts to poison Andr√©. Then she shoots her husband before he can feed Andr√© the poisoned soup. As she checks to see if her husband is dead, he grabs her and chokes her to death. Andr√© escapes from his cellar prison on a bad leg and emerges to find the farmer couple dead and a liberated Europe. He rejoins his wife and daughter at Chez Jean Valjean and then represents Henri at his trial and wins his acquittal. As the film ends, Henri, now the mayor, presides at the civil marriage of Salom√© and Marius in the presence of Andr√© and Elisa and the mother superior of the school that sheltered Salom√©.

He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003, and served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from 2004 to early 2006. Gary Carr is currently the Chair of the Regional Municipality of Halton. Background Carr has a certificate in Business Administration from Ryerson University, and was a businessman and sales manager in the transportation industry before entering public life. He continued his education as a politician, and received an MBA from Athabasca University in 2002. Carr also played professional ice hockey for five years in the farm teams of the Boston Bruins and Quebec Nordiques. In 1975, he was a Memorial Cup champion as a member of the Toronto Marlboros. Provincial politics Carr was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Doug Carrothers by 108 votes in the riding of Oakville South. From 1993 to 1995, he was his party's Deputy House Leader. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Mike Harris in the provincial election of 1995, and Carr was easily re- elected. He was appointed as a parliamentary assistant to the Solicitor- General for the entire term. Carr was again re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Kevin Flynn by over 13,000 votes. He was chosen as Speaker of the legislature on October 20, 1999, and held this position for the entirety of the parliament which followed. Like his predecessor Chris Stockwell, Carr was known as an impartial Speaker who was willing to criticize his own government. In 2003, he alienated several members of the Progressive Conservative Party by ruling that the government of Ernie Eves had committed a prima facie act of contempt against the legislature by holding its budget announcement at the headquarters of Magna International, rather than in the legislature itself. He was critical of the direction taken by the Progressive Conservative Party in this period, and did not seek re- election in 2003. He left politics and briefly coached the London Racers hockey team in London, UK. Federal politics In 2004 Carr was recruited to run as a Liberal in the riding of Halton, which bordered his old provincial riding. He defeated Conservative candidate Dean Martin in the election. Carr was defeated in the 2006 election by Conservative challenger Garth Turner. Halton regional chair Gary Carr was elected as Chair of Halton Region on November 13, 2006. Carr overwhelmingly defeated former Halton Region CAO Brent Marshall, who resigned from his position as CAO to run against Carr. Carr was sworn in as the Regional Chairman on December 6, 2006.

Biography Born in the Republic of Genoa, in the 1460s Bartholomew was a mapmaker in Lisbon, the principal center of cartography of the time, and conceived with his brother the \\"Enterprise of the Indies\\", a planned expedition to reach the Orient and its lucrative spice trade by a western rather than an eastern route. In 1489 he went to England to seek assistance from Henry VII for the execution of the expedition. He was taken by pirates and landed in England in a destitute condition, and on presenting himself at Court was unfavorably received. He then sought help at the court of Charles VIII in France, again without success. Meanwhile, his brother Christopher was in Castile trying to persuade Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon to back the expedition. When word arrived in 1493 that his brother had succeeded, Bartholomew returned to Spain, where he missed Christopher, who had already left on the second voyage of his four to the \\"New World\\". Funded by the Crown, Bartholomew Columbus traveled to Hispaniola in 1494 to meet his brother, where he was appointed as an Adelantado, a senior-ranking governor, during his brother's absences. He founded the city of Santo Domingo on Hispaniola between 1496 and 1498, which is now the capital of the Dominican Republic. He was imprisoned together with Christopher and another brother, Giacomo (also called Diego), by Francisco de Bobadilla and returned to Spain in December 1500. After the Court acquitted Christopher Columbus of all of the charges, the Crown funded Christopher Columbus's fourth and last voyage to the West Indies. Bartholomew accompanied his brother on this final 'New World' voyage, and was to be left with a garrison near the Bel√©n River. Bartholomew's men were attacked by the local Ng√§be leader, El Quib√≠an. Adelantado Bartholomew Columbus came across a Yucatec Maya canoe in the Gulf of Honduras. On 30 July 1502, they arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras. Christopher sent his brother to scout the island. As Bartholomew explored, a large trading canoe approached. Bartholomew Columbus boarded the canoe, and found it was a Maya trading vessel from Yucat√°n, carrying well- dressed Maya and a rich cargo. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes ‚Äì the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam. Following Christopher Columbus's death in Spain in 1506, Bartholomew returned to the Antilles in 1509, accompanying his nephew Diego, but Bartholomew soon returned to Spain when the King confirmed his concession involving Mona Island near Puerto Rico; the King would reclaim the appealing little islandMona, Puerto Rico#Mona Island today from Bartholomew's heirs after Bartholomew's death on 12 August 1514 (by which time Bartholomew had returned to Hispaniola). Bartholomew Columbus is known to have fathered a daughter out of wedlock, named Maria and born in 1508. Legacy The island of Saint Barth√©lemy in the Caribbean was named in his honour by Christopher Columbus.

Keneally moved on from the elder Zappa's band to work with the eldest Zappa son, Dweezil, on his solo albums and work released as the band Z. Keneally has also released 11 albums of solo material since 1992 and has guested or acted as sideman on a wide variety of projects, most notably as part of Steve Vai's touring bands. He has played guitar and keyboards with Yo Miles!, Wadada Leo Smith, Norwegian legends Ulver and Henry Kaiser's Miles Davis tribute band as well as recording the 1995 album The Mistakes with Henry Kaiser, Prairie Prince, and Andy West (formerly of Dixie Dregs). He has also produced albums for several bands, including Chris Opperman's debut album, Oppy Music, Vol. I: Purple, Crayon. In 1998 Vai requested that Keneally arrange and perform an album of Vai's music on acoustic piano. Recorded in 1999, the album was finally released in 2004 as Vai Piano Reductions, Vol. 1: Performed by Mike Keneally. According to liner notes, Vai selected the songs, produced the album, and mixed it, releasing it on his own Light Without Heat label. As of 2008 Keneally has arranged from multi-tracked guitar parts to single-track piano the 12 songs selected by Steve and begun work on a second volume of Vai \\"Piano Reductions\\". On May 1, 2007, Keneally's Exowax label re-released his debut album hat. and Boil That Dust Speck as deluxe, remastered double disc versions. A remixed and remastered edition of Sluggo! followed in 2013. Exowax has obtained Keneally's entire back catalog from Immune Records. Planned releases included Half Alive in Hollywood, as well as the Mike Keneally and Beer for Dolphins 1996 VHS release Soap Scum Remover, which will be remixed and remastered for a DVD release, and the Mistakes, his 1995 side project with Henry Kaiser on guitar and Synclavier, bassist Andy West and drummer Prairie Prince, along with a live Mistakes recording that has been held on the side until Keneally was able to re-acquire the rights to the original album. On November 28, 2006, Keneally announced that he was hired as National Music Director for The Paul Green School of Rock Music. He has also toured with Dethklok as a guitarist and back up vocalist. On July 20, 2008, at El Cajon, Calif., Mike played a concert as part of \\"the most exciting power trio in years,\\" Keneally ‚Ä¢ Minnemann ‚Ä¢ Beller (KMB), consisting of Mike, drummer Marco Minnemann and long-time collaborating bassist Bryan Beller. The band undertook a full tour in 2009 and became Joe Satriani's worldwide touring band in 2013. In August 2009, Keneally released a video for a new solo track, \\"Hallmark\\", from Scambot 1, the first part of a planned three-album series. In June 2010, Keneally entered Skywalker Sound as part of the studio band for Joe Satriani's new solo project, along with regular Satriani drummer Jeff Campitelli and bassist Allen Whitman (of San Francisco's surf/psychedelic group the Mermen). This same lineup was scheduled to tour in October and November 2010 in support of the album; however Keneally was replaced by English keyboardist Jem Godfrey for two dates on the UK leg of the tour. In July 2012, Keneally released Wing Beat Fantastic: Songs written by Mike Keneally & Andy Partridge, a collaborative album consisting primarily of songs co-written with XTC's Andy Partridge during two writing sessions in 2006 and 2008, and of whose band and work Keneally has been a longtime fan (there is a small section of XTC's \\"Mayor of Simpleton\\" in the song \\"Day of the Cow 2\\" from his 1992 debut solo album hat.) In August 2014, Keneally participated in the G4 Experience‚Äîa week-long guitar camp‚Äîwith fellow guitarists Satriani, Paul Gilbert, and Andy Timmons.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball with the Florida Marlins (1994‚Äì1998, 2001‚Äì2002), the Los Angeles Dodgers (1998), the Baltimore Orioles (1999‚Äì2000), the Chicago White Sox (2000), the Colorado Rockies (2003‚Äì2004), and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2005). The two- time National League All-Star player was considered as one of the best defensive catchers of his era, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards between and . He was a member of the world champion Florida Marlins team and, is one of only three catchers in Major League history to catch at least 100 games in a single season without committing an error. Early life and major League career Johnson was born in Fort Pierce, Florida where he graduated from Fort Pierce Westwood High School in Fort Pierce, Florida. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. He did not sign, and decided to enroll at the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team. He was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the first round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft. He played with the A-level Kane County Cougars in 1993 and the AA Portland Sea Dogs. In 1995, Johnson's reputation as a skilled defensive player was solidified when he became the fourth catcher in Major League history to win a Gold Glove Award in his rookie season, joining Johnny Bench, Carlton Fisk and Sandy Alomar, Jr. Although his offensive statistics weren't impressive, he made up for those shortcomings by helping his team with his superior defensive skills. In 1996, Johnson was the Marlins catcher when Al Leiter threw a no- hitter against the Colorado Rockies. Johnson set a Major League record in 1997 by playing in 123 games without committing a single error, earning him his first All-Star selection, and helping the Marlins win the 1997 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. Johnson led the Marlins in the Series with 10 hits, batting .357 including one home run. Along with winning his third consecutive Gold Glove Award in 1997, he also caught his second no hitter when Kevin Brown no hit the Giants on June 10. In , the Marlins traded Johnson along with Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich, Gary Sheffield and Manuel Barriosto to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. After finishing the season with the Dodgers, he played for two years in the American League with the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox. He had his best year offensively in , when he had a .304 batting average along with 31 home runs and 91 RBIs, during a season in which he played 84 games for the Orioles and 44 games for the White Sox. In 2001 he was traded back to the Marlins, where he hit .285 with 16 home runs by mid-season to earn his second All-Star berth. He would also catch his third no hitter when A. J. Burnett no hit the San Diego Padres on May 12. The only Marlins no-hitters Johnson has not caught for Florida were in 2006, when An√≠bal S√°nchez threw a no-hitter in Dolphin Stadium against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 2013 when Henderson √Ålvarez no-hit the Detroit Tigers, and 2017 when Edinson V√≥lquez no-hit the Diamondbacks. After the 2002 season, the Marlins traded Johnson to the Colorado Rockies where he played for two seasons. On April 27, 2004, he, rookie Matt Holliday, and Jeromy Burnitz combined to slug back-to-back-to-back home runs against the Marlins, the sixth such occasion in franchise history. After playing for Colorado, he ended his career with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2005. Career statistics In a twelve-season major league career covering 1,188 games, Johnson had a .245 batting average along with 167 home runs, 570 runs batted in and a .993 fielding percentage. His .993 fielding percentage ranks 16th all-time among major league catchers. Along with his four Gold Glove Awards, Johnson twice led National League catchers in fielding percentage, and once each in baserunners caught stealing and assists. During his playing career, he ranked second only to Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez in throwing out baserunners, with a 39% average. He earned two All-Star berths as well as winning a World Series during his career. His three no hitters caught ties him with several other players for third place on the all-time list behind the four no hitters caught by Jason Varitek and Carlos Ruiz. Johnson played more games as a catcher than any other player in Marlins history (582). He now lives in Miami with his wife Rhonda. They have two sons. Brandon, who plays college football as a wide receiver for the University of Tennessee and Beau, who plays college football as a tight end for Georgia Southern University. Johnson is a cousin of former Major Leaguer Fred McGriff. He is a member of the Portland Sea Dogs Hall of Fame.

Originally, the Company was known as Kass√°k Haz Studi√≥ and was located at Uzsoki-utca 57, Budapest). For political and aesthetic reasons the Company emigrated to Paris then to the United States where they arrived in New York City first living at the Hotel Chelsea and then at 256 West 23rd Street where they lived, worked and performed from 1977 to 1985. Several members left Squat Theatre in 1985 when they lost the lease to their space on 23rd Street including Anna Ko√≥s, P√©ter Hal√°sz, Eric Daille, and Agnes Santha. The rest of the Company continued until 1991. Squat Theatre's last play was Full Moon Killer, 1991 and performed at The Kitchen in New York City. The space on 23rd Street had a large window with a street entrance, and spectators sat in the back of the store facing the storefront window and the street beyond. Events took place with the street as backdrop, with the intention of unsettling the events, the relationship among the members of the group, and the audience. This set-up was first used in Rotterdam at 129a Van Oldenbarneveltstraat in the show Pig, Child, Fire! which was commissioned by the Toneelraad Rotterdam.Drawing by Anne-Marie Duguet, Buchmuller, Ko√≥s.

History In 1969 Anna Ko√≥s, P√©ter Hal√°sz and Stephan Balint from the University Theatre of Budapest created an independent theatre group called Kass√°k Haz Studi√≥. In 1972 they were censored by the Hungarian authorities for \\"political and esthetic radicalism\\",Letter from Executive Committee to Peter Halasz, 14th District Municipal Council Record Office, Budapest, 24 January 1972, File No. 2203X, Squat Theatre Book, p.3. and banned from performing in public. In the next four years they wrote 36 performance events: plays, sketches and improvisations. These were shown in apartments, staircases, streets, beaches, and in the countryside. \\"Manifesto\\" by Istv√°n B√°lint (Stephan Balint) on behalf of Studio Kassak was published in Schmuck, Hungary, March‚ÄìApril, 1973 issue.Istv√°n B√°lint, \\"Manifesto\\", Written in the name of \\"studio-kassak\\", Budapest, April, 1972_Buchmuller, Ko√≥s.

While living in Paris in 1977, Tamas Szentjoby suggested the company change its name to Squat Theatre. The company created their first play for a Western audience: Pig, Child, Fire! It was set in a storefront in Rotterdam, a setting that became their trademark. After touring Nancy, France, Shiraz, Baltimore, Paris, the company arrived with their goat at the Hotel Chelsea in New York City. Andy Warhol's Last Love opened on 23rd Street in 1978. The Company went on tour to Hamburg, Rome. Milan, Florence, Belgrade, Rotterdam and Brussels. It won a Grand Prix at the Belgrade International Theatre Festival (BITEF), and the Italian Critics‚Äô Award for the Best Foreign Performance.Office of the Mayor, Downtown Enforcement Unit. Re.

In 1981 Mr Dead & Mrs Free premiered in Cologne, Germany. Commissioned by Ivan Nagel director of Theater der Welt and shown at Cologne‚Äôs ‚ÄúTheatres of the World‚Äù festival, Mr. Dead & Mrs. Free was filmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder as part of his first and only documentary Theater in Trance. It was also shown in New York City and Amsterdam. The show had a year- and-a-half performance run on 23rd Street. It was awarded an Obie Award (1982) for the Best New American Play. It received a The Villager (Manhattan) Award. An open-air version of the show, The Battle of Sirolo was performed in August in Polverigi, Italy. In 1981 Vincent Gallo ran a film night at Squat Theatre. In the monthly schedule he wrote funny insightful critiques of the films he curated. And before and between films he DJ'd rare records. Those who remember Gallo's film night say it was the best curated film series ever put on. A photo of Vincent Gallo and his iconoclast industrial noise band Bohack is featured on the back cover of the Bohack LP titled \\"It Took Several Wives\\" In the summer of 1985 the theatre lost their eight-year lease of their home and performance space on 23rd Street.

Its color is normally apple-green, but varies to deep green. The darker varieties of chrysoprase are also referred to as prase. (However, the term prase is also used to describe chlorite-included quartz, and to a certain extent is a color-descriptor, rather than a rigorously defined mineral variety.) Chrysoprase is cryptocrystalline, which means that it is composed of crystals so fine that they cannot be seen as distinct particles under normal magnification. This sets it apart from rock crystal, amethyst, citrine, and the other varieties of crystalline quartz. Other members of the cryptocrystalline silica family include agate, carnelian, and onyx. Unlike many non-transparent silica minerals, it is the color of chrysoprase, rather than any pattern of markings, that makes it desirable. The word chrysoprase comes from the Greek œáœÅœÖœÉœåœÇ chrysos meaning 'gold' and œÄœÅŒ¨œÉŒπŒΩŒøŒΩ prasinon, meaning 'green'. A polished chrysoprase stone Unlike emerald which owes its green color to the presence of chromium, the color of chrysoprase is due to trace amounts of nickel compounds in the form of very small inclusions. The nickel reportedly occurs as different silicates, like kerolite or pimelite (not NiO mineral, bunsenite, as was reported before). Chrysoprase results from the deep weathering or lateritization of nickeliferous serpentinites or other ultramafic ophiolite rocks. In the Australian deposits, chrysoprase occurs as veins and nodules with brown goethite and other iron oxides in the magnesite- rich saprolite below an iron and silica cap. As with all forms of chalcedony, chrysoprase has a hardness of 6‚Äì7 on the Mohs hardness scale and a conchoidal fracture like flint. The best known sources of chrysoprase are Indonesia, Queensland, Western Australia, Haneti Tanzania, Germany, Poland, Russia, Arizona, California, and Brazil. Deposits in central Tanzania have been in constant production since 1986. The chrysoprase and Ni silicate ore deposit in Szklary, Lower Silesia, Poland, was probably the biggest European chrysoprase occurrence and possibly also the biggest in the world. A very similar mineral to chrysoprase is chrome chalcedony, in which the color is provided by chromium rather than nickel.

Due to the lack of audiovisual references for the characters at the time, there were no clear cut ways of representing the characters in Spanish, nor there were exact translations for their names. Rivera came up with the name of Yoyo Boing for representing Jughead; the name \\"Yoyo\\" sounded close to \\"Jughead\\", and the \\"Boing\\" part was a gimmick Rivera developed for the character: a vocalized \\"boing\\" that he constantly repeated to fill in silence gaps during each episode. Ever since his Archie stint on Puerto Rican radio, Puerto Ricans rarely refer to Rivera using his real name, and usually refer to him by his by-now \\"nickname\\". Pioneer in Puerto Rican television 1954 was the year that television was born in Puerto Rico. Rivera, together with Tommy Mu√±iz, Jos√© Miguel Agrelot and Paquito Cordero was one of the first comedians in Puerto Rican television. In 1960, he starred. alongside Norma Candal (Petunia) in a television comedy called \\"La Cr√≠ada Malcr√≠ada\\" (The Rude Maid). In the 1970s, Rivera starred in own sit-com called \\"Mi Hippie Me Encanta\\" (I'm Crazy about My Hippie) broadcast by Telemundo. In the 1980s, Rivera starred in the situation comedies, \\"Generaciones\\", (Generations), with Chayanne, \\"Los Suegros\\" (The In-Laws) and later in a spin-off of that show called \\"Los Suegros y Los Nietos\\" (The In-Laws and the Grandchildren), broadcast by WAPA- TV. Rivera was also the General Manager of radio stations WKBM-AM (\\"AM 81\\") and WORO-FM (\\"Radio Oro\\", or Golden Radio), the radio branches of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan. Various media producers arranged for many Puerto Rican performers to tour New York City in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Rivera was one of these. As fate would have it, one particularly chilly evening Rivera and Bobby Cap√≥ were exiting a performance outside the Teatro Puerto Rico and were looking for a place to eat. While waiting for public transportation, Rivera told Bobby Cap√≥ two jokes. These two jokes, reinterpreted by Cap√≥ and set to music, became two major musical hits: \\"El Negro Bemb√≥n\\", for Rafael Cortijo and his Combo (sung by Ismael Rivera), and \\"El Caballo Pelotero\\", a smash hit for El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico (original version sung by Pell√≠n Rodr√≠guez). For years, Rivera co-hosted \\"El Show del Mediodia\\", a midday variety show, on WAPA-TV alongside Luis Vigoreaux. After Vigoreaux was murdered early in 1983, Rivera became the show's main host, position in which he performed for several years afterwards. Later years In the 1990s, Rivera wrote a book titled \\"A Re√≠r Con Yoyo\\" (Let's Laugh with Yoyo) and donated all of the proceeds to an AIDS organization. He was also active in a television show called \\"Desde Mi Pueblo\\" (\\"From My Town\\") for WIPR-TV (San Juan's channel 6), where he would visit every town and city and show all of the interesting aspects of the featured place. His co-hosts on the program were Deborah Carthy-Deu, Maria Falcon and Tony Croatto. After Jos√© Miguel Agrelot's sudden death in 2004, the remaining co-hosts on Agrelot's long-running radio show \\"Tu Alegre Despertar\\", (Your Cheerful Wake-Up), Aurora Previdi and Mar√≠a Falc√≥n, asked the radio audience to select a permanent replacement for Agrelot from a round of temporary co-hosts. Rivera won the assignment; given the wishes of Agrelot's family to achieve some closure, the program changed its name to \\"Contigo en el tap√≥n\\" (\\"Along With You In The Traffic Jam\\") and changed its format slightly. Rivera remains as a popular co- host, filling Agrelot's considerably large shoes. He also hosts a daily program of Puerto Rican music classics at Allegro WIPR-FM. Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi wrote a performance novel using the Yoyo Boing nickname as a title with some punctuation added: \\"Yo-Yo Boing!\\". Featuring a tinted photo of Rivera with overimposed X-ray specs for the book's jacket, the comic bilingual novel has very little to do with Rivera himself, but does feature a dream sequence inspired by childhood memories of the roles he played. By the 2000s, Rivera was retired from television but making special appearances. He was the protagonist of the locally produced movie for television \\"Santa Clos es Boricua\\" (Santa Claus is Puerto Rican) which was telecast in Puerto Rico and the United States through Televicentro on December 20, 2004.. Since the early 2010s Rivera, who celebrated his 90th birthday on April 9, 2020 has been the host and producer of the popular radio talk show Tus Compa√±eros Del Tap√≥n, a daily afternoon program on 940AM, WIPR (AM). In 2020, Rivera suffered a stroke. A successful fundraiser was organized by a local journalist to provide Rivera with a power wheelchair lift.

Cain. Luchino Visconti‚Äôs first feature film, it is considered by many to be the first Italian neorealist film, though there is some debate about whether such a categorization is accurate.  Plot  Gino Costa, a wandering tramp, stops at a small roadside tavern and petrol station run by Giovanna Bragana and her older husband, Giuseppe. Giovanna is disgusted by her husband, having married him only for his money, and is instantly drawn to the younger and more attractive Gino. Giovanna serves Gino a meal, and they are interrupted by Giuseppe, who throws him out. Giovanna claims Gino didn't pay while pocketing his money, as an excuse for him to return. Giuseppe chases after Gino, only to find that Gino has no money left. Gino offers to fix Giuseppe‚Äôs vehicle as repayment for the meal. When Giuseppe leaves to pick up a part for the vehicle, Gino and Giovanna confess their feelings to each other and begin an affair. Giuseppe, completely oblivious to the situation, takes a liking to Gino and tells him that he can stay and help out around the tavern. After a few days, Gino tries to convince Giovanna to run away with him. Giovanna initially agrees, but on the way to the train station she changes her mind and refuses to go through with it, so Gino leaves without her. While Gino is on the train, he is confronted by the ticket inspector and admits that he has no money. ‚ÄúLo Spagnolo,‚Äù a travelling street entertainer, steps in to pay for his train ticket and the two become friends. When they reach the city of Ancona, Gino spends a night at an inn with Spagnolo, where he reveals that he cannot stop thinking about Giovanna. When Spagnolo learns that Giovanna refuses to leave her husband because she fears having no money and security, he advises Gino to ‚Äúrun far away‚Äù and forget about Giovanna. Later that night, Spagnolo lights a cigarette and holds the match up in the dark bedroom to watch Gino while he sleeps. Gino stays in Ancona and gets a job holding up an advertisement sign for Spagnolo. Giuseppe and Giovanna run into Gino by chance and the three go to a bar where Giuseppe is to sing in a voice competition. While Giuseppe is on stage, Gino confesses to Giovanna that he tried to forget her but could not, and tries again to convince her to leave with him. Even though Giovanna still has feelings for Gino, she refuses and tells him that she will stay with her husband, to which he angrily replies ‚Äúthen I‚Äôll come back to the tavern, is that what you want?‚Äù After the voice competition, the three leave together to return to the Braganas‚Äô tavern. Giuseppe has been celebrating his successful singing performance and is quite drunk. Gino and Giovanna take advantage of his inebriated state and conspire to murder him. They convince Giuseppe to let Gino drive, and they stage the murder as a traffic accident. In the aftermath of their crime, tensions begin to arise. Gino wants to sell the tavern and leave while Giovanna wants to stay and run the tavern. Gino feels guilty about the murder, and his guilt is amplified by the fact that he is now living in the home of the man he killed. This causes him to feel trapped and he acts coldly to Giovanna. Giovanna hosts a party at the tavern to increase business. Spagnolo shows up at the party. Initially Gino is happy to see him, but becomes agitated when Spagnolo tries to get him to leave and go travelling with him. When Spagnolo implies that he knows of Gino's crime, Gino loses his temper and punches him. A bystander, who is actually a detective that has been investigating Gino and Giovanna, helps Spagnolo up. As Spagnolo walks away, Gino calls out to him but he doesn't turn around. One day while Gino and Giovanna are in town, Gino flirts with Anita, a young prostitute. Anita leaves, and Giovanna approaches Gino to tell him that Giuseppe had life insurance. This makes Gino feel that Giovanna has used him, and he feels even more guilt-ridden over the murder. He angrily yells at Giovanna that he doesn't want to be with her anymore, and goes off to find Anita. Gino and Anita spend some time together in Anita's apartment before deciding to leave together to get some food. While they are outside they run into Giovanna, who has been sitting at a caf√© outside Anita's apartment building. Giovanna angrily confronts Gino and Anita runs off. Giovanna threatens to tell the police that Gino killed Giuseppe if Gino doesn't stay with her, to which Gino loses his temper and hits her, causing a scene. Gino then goes back to Anita's apartment and confesses the crime to her. Meanwhile, two men have reported to the police that they saw Gino and Giovanna both walking away from the vehicle unharmed on the night of the murder. Gino doesn't know this, but he is afraid that Giovanna has gone to the police, and he recognizes the detective who has been following him waiting outside Anita's apartment. Gino convinces Anita to help him escape by distracting the detective, and he leaves the building via the balcony. Gino then returns to Giovanna at the tavern, who tells him that she never reported him to the police, and that she is pregnant with his child and still loves him. During this conversation, they are overheard by a young boy who helps at the tavern. Gino notices the boy and asks him ‚Äúdo you think I am a bad man?‚Äù to which the boy replies ‚Äúno.‚Äù Gino then leaves and spends a night wandering alone. Giovanna searches for him all night and finds him the next day on the beach. Gino seems to have come to terms with the crime and has new resolve to love Giovanna and start a new life with her. They make up and spend some romantic time together on the beach. Gino tells Giovanna about the detective, and she finally agrees that they need to leave the tavern to start a new life. They return to the tavern briefly and leave in the vehicle. Realizing that the police are on their trail, they drive as fast as they can and end up tailgating a large truck. In a twist of fate, the truck knocks their car over the edge of the road and into the river, killing Giovanna. Devastated, Gino carries her body out of the wreckage and surrenders to the police.

He had initially planned to adapt a story by Giovanni Verga, a renowned Italian realist writer and one of his greatest influences, but it was turned down almost immediately by the Fascist authorities due to its subject matter, which revolved around bandits. Around this time, Visconti uncovered a French translation of Cain's novel which, famously, had been given to him by French director Jean Renoir while he was working in France in the 1930s. Visconti adapted the script with a group of men he selected from the Milanese magazine Cinema. The members of this group were talented filmmakers and writers and played a large role in the emerging neorealist movement: Mario Alicata, Gianni Puccini, Antonio Pietrangeli and Giuseppe De Santis. When Ossessione was completed and released in 1943, it was far from the innocent murder mystery the authorities had expected; after a few screenings in Rome and northern Italy, prompting outraged reactions from Fascist and Church authorities, the film was banned by the Fascist government reestablished in the German occupied part of Italy after the September 1943 armistice. Eventually the Fascists destroyed the film, but Visconti managed to keep a duplicate negative from which all existing prints have been made. After the war, Ossessione encountered more problems with mass distribution, this time in the United States. As a result of the wartime production schedule, Visconti had never obtained the rights to the novel and Metro-Goldwyn Mayer began production on another version of the film, directed by Tay Garnett (The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946), while the Fascist ban on Visconti's work was still in effect. Due to the copyright issues, the film didn't gain distribution outside of Italy until 1976. Despite limited screenings, it gained acclaim among moviegoers who recognized in it some of the same sensibilities they had grown familiar with in neorealist films by Michaelangelo Antonioni, Puccini and De Santis, among others. Cinematic technique For the most part, Visconti retained the plot of the novel. He made changes such as tailoring the script to its Italian setting and adding a character, but the main departure from the novel and the defining characteristic of the film is the manner in which it confronts the realities of life. In one particularly memorable scene that anticipates a major theme of neorealism, Ossessione‚Äôs central female character enters her wildly messy kitchen, serves herself a bowl of soup and sits down with a newspaper, only to fall asleep, slumped over wearily in the midst of the confusion. At several moments like this one, Visconti slows the pace to give the viewer an even more penetrating glimpse into the routine of his characters and, in doing so, roots the narrative squarely in the life of his characters. In another scene, the three are eating when Bregana comments that a local landowner has been shot from behind by a worker, believed to be the result of the worker's love for the landowner's wife. In this way, Visconti foreshadows Bragana‚Äôs own death and illuminates the study of class tension that is woven fluidly into the film. Soon afterwards, Bragana submits to his wife's physical and verbal responses to cats outside crying or due to the heat. He fetches his shotgun and leaves. Shortly after his exit, the adulterous lovers huddle close and hear gunshots, thereby hinting at the doom also reserved for two lovers \\"in heat.\\" The landscape itself is realistic, and Visconti takes great care to situate his characters in a rural Italy that remains for the most part unromanticized. Nearly the entire story is told using medium and long shots, with Visconti choosing to employ close-ups only at moments of intense emotion. Characters are depicted interacting with and moving around within their environment; to this effect, Visconti favors long and ponderous shots while making use of depth of focus to highlight the variety of action occurring throughout the space of the frame. He resists identifying solely with one character and prefers instead to maintain a distance, taking them all in with his viewfinder as independent but irrevocably tangled components of a larger cast, which includes the sets, scenery and landscape as well as what goes on outside of the frame. Shots of the landscape largely consist of the dusty road winding into the distance and the interior shots are just as bleak; the dowdy kitchen exudes a nearly tangible film of dust and grime and the dingy hotel room that speaks, with each detail, of the rebellious freedom cherished by those who share it. The shift of focus from the novel is clear even in Visconti's decision to change the title. Whereas the novel's title alludes to the final retribution exacted upon the adulterous couple, Visconti's header bespeaks the focus of his film, obsessive passion. Despite arguments about how to define neorealist cinema, certainly one of Ossessione‚Äôs most poignant aspects is its stark realism. Despite being popular actors of Italian cinema, the stars of the film, Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai, deliver breathtaking performances that are anything but glamorous. The lovers, Gino and Giovanna, played by Girotti and Calamai, first meet in the kitchen of the inn that Giovanna runs with her husband, the fat and dim-witted Bragana. It is in the symbolic and literal center of the family sphere, before they ever touch, that the two make a silent oath. Their love, tainted as it is by a lie, is difficult for either of them to bear and the tension is only exacerbated by Bregana's overwhelming presence. Unable to continue the affair under such pretense but genuinely in love, Gino tries to persuade Giovanna to leave with him. She is clearly tempted but knows of the power the road has over Gino, a relationship that Visconti executes nearly as palpably as that between him and Giovanna. She ultimately refuses Gino, opting for the security and stability that Bragana has to offer, and he sets out once again unencumbered. When they cross paths some time later, it is in the city and Bragana is extremely drunk, engaged in a singing competition. Against the backdrop of the drunken and foolish Bregana, the couple plans his death, an act they carry out in a car crash. Rather than granting them the freedom they so desperately seek, however, the murder only heightens the need for deception and makes more acute the guilt they had previously been dealing with. Despite Giovanna's attempt to construct a normal life with Gino, Bragana's presence seems to remain long after they return to the inn. Their already crumbling relationship reaches its bounds when they go to collect the money from Bragana's life insurance policy. They have a very hostile argument and Gino retaliates by engaging Anita, an attractive young prostitute. Though Giovanna is pregnant and there seems to be some hope for the couple, Gino is left alone to deal with the law when Giovanna is killed in the film's second car crash. The character of lo Spagnolo (the Spaniard), Visconti's main textual departure from the novel, plays a pivotal role in the story of Ossessione. After failing to convince Giovanna to flee with him, Gino meets Spagnolo after boarding a train to the city and the two of them strike up an instant friendship, subsequently working and living together. Spagnolo is an actor who works as a street vendor and serves as a foil to Giovanna's traditionalism and inability to let go of the material lifestyle. In contrast to the other main characters, who come across as very real and thoroughly developed, Spagnolo operates chiefly on a symbolic level. He represents for Gino the possibility of a liberated masculinity living a life successfully separate from society's impositions, an alternative to the life he is drawn toward in his relationship with Giovanna. Both Giovanna and Gino are tragic characters in their inability to find a space in which to situate themselves comfortably. The limited roles made available by society prove to be insufficient in providing narratives for their lives that bring them closer to happiness. Giovanna is pulled away from the security of her marriage to the repulsive Bragana by a desire for true love and fulfillment, whose potential is actualized with the appearance of Gino. Her attempts to hold onto the fortune which came with marriage, however, ultimately lead to the failure of their relationship and perhaps, by extension, her death. Gino's situation seems to be just as distinct, if not more so, as the force pulling him away from Giovanna is his fear of a traditional commitment. From the first time that they sleep together, after which Giovanna shares with Gino all of her deepest problems while he listens to the sound of waves in a seashell, it is clear that he answers only to the open road, identifying it as his alternative to becoming an active part of mainstream society. Spagnolo is the road manifest, masculine freedom in opposition to Giovanna's femininity, love and family values. Caught in between the two conflicting ideals, Gino ends up violating both of them and dooming himself in the process. Visconti's approach to filmmaking is very structured and he provides several pairs of parallel events, such as the car crashes. Gino meets Spagnolo as they sit side by side on a wall, a scene that is repeated at the end of their friendship; similarly, Gino angrily leaves Giovanna by the side of the road and is later abandoned by Spagnolo in a parallel scene. Cinematic techniques, such as the instances in which Visconti foreshadows major plot twists or the introduction of Spagnolo as a counterweight, demonstrate Visconti's formalist streak and technical virtuosity, but his realist vision and taste for drama are truly what breathe life into Ossessione.

It was Treasure's debut game, originally released on the Sega Genesis in 1993. The game's premise is centered around a pair of characters, the Gunstars, in their efforts to stop an evil empire from recovering four powerful gems. The characters can fire guns and perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers to fight enemies across each stage. There are four weapons in the game which can be combined with one another to create different shot types. Development on Gunstar Heroes began among a team of staff working at Konami in 1991. Following an unwillingness of Konami to embrace their original game ideas, the team quit in 1992 and formed Treasure to see their project through. The team wanted to develop their game for the Genesis because of the system's powerful Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Sega initially rejected their proposal, but later granted approval after they had been working for Sega for several months on McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure (1993). Treasure worked on both games in parallel, and released Gunstar Heroes worldwide as their first game in 1993. Gunstar Heroes was a critical success, being praised for its frantic action and advanced graphics. It helped establish Treasure's place in the industry, and introduced several design conventions which would become characteristic of their later work such as large bosses and a unique sense of humor. It was re-released several times, including dedicated ports to the Game Gear and Nintendo 3DS, and received a sequel on the Game Boy Advance. In retrospect, it is considered one of the best action games of the 16-bit era, and one of the best video games of all time by several publications.  Gameplay  The player runs to the right as they fire the machine gun Gunstar Heroes is a run and gun game played from a side-scrolling perspective similar to Contra. The game can be played in single-player, or cooperatively with a partner. The players take on the role of Gunstar Red and Gunstar Blue as they battle with an evil empire for control over a set of powerful gems. The game features seven stages, of which the first four can be tackled in any order. The stage formats vary; while some feature a typical left-to-right format, others have the player riding in a mine cart along walls, fighting enemies on a helicopter, or playing a board game. Completing a level grants the player an extension to their maximum health. When starting a game, the player can choose either a free or fixed firing stance; the fixed stance immobilizes the character when shooting, while the free stance has the player move in the direction they are firing. The player also has a choice of starting weapon. There are four shot types in the game: a homing shot, lightning blaster, flamethrower, and machine gun. Each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses, and can be swapped with others from item drops in each stage. The weapons can be combined with each other to produce unique shot types. For example, the homing shot can be combined with the machine gun to add a homing effect to the latter, or two lightning shots can be combined to create a more powerful lightning gun. In addition to firing their weapon, the player characters can pull off a series of acrobatic maneuvers including jumping, sliding, and grabbing and throwing enemies.  Development  In 1991, several Konami employees led by programmer Masato Maegawa began holding planning sessions at coffee shops for an original game. (Abridged translation ) They were establishing early concepts for an action shooting game, a genre they were familiar with. They pitched their idea to Konami, but were told it would not sell and it was rejected. Maegawa and his team were growing frustrated with the industry's reliance on sequels to established franchises and console conversions of arcade games to generate revenue. They felt Konami had fallen into this pattern as a large company, growing reliant on sequels in their Castlevania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. Maegawa and his team felt consumers wanted original games, and so in 1992, they left Konami and established Treasure to continue development on their original game. Treasure believed the Motorola 68000 microprocessor in the Sega Genesis was best suited for the action games they wanted to make. Treasure wanted to develop their game for Sega's Genesis. Maegawa was interested in the platform because of its Motorola 68000 microprocessor, which he felt was easier to program for than the Super NES, and more powerful. The team decided to approach Sega for a publishing contract. When they first presented their design documents to Sega, they were not granted approval because they lacked a proven track record. Instead, Sega contracted Treasure to develop McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure (1993). Several months into development, they were finally granted approval to work on their original action game. They originally were using the working title Lunatic Gunstar, thinking \\"Lunatic\\" was a good description of the game's stimulating action. Sega of America felt the word held a negative connotation, so rejected it. The team also considered Blade Gunner, in homage to Blade Runner, but this was also rejected because of copyright restrictions. Sega of America eventually suggested the word \\"Heroes,\\" so Gunstar Heroes became the final title. Treasure consisted of around 18 people, most being programmers from Konami. The staff was split in half to work on both Gunstar Heroes and McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure in parallel. The core team behind Gunstar Heroes consisted of six people: two programmers, two graphic designers, and two sound programmers. The staff (known by their nicknames) was composed of main programmer Yaiman, enemy and boss programmer Nami, graphic designers Han and Iuchi, composer Non, and sound effects programmer Murata. The role of game designer did not exist within Treasure; all game design and planning was undertaken by everyone involved. The team felt they had more freedom working under Sega than Konami. Maegawa got approval to add a Treasure logo when the game booted, which he felt was a rare opportunity for developers to get in that era. The Genesis's processor made multi-limbed bosses like \\"Seven Force\\" possible Development of Gunstar Heroes lasted around nine to ten months. It was the team's first experience programming for the Genesis, having come off programming for the Super NES at Konami. Programmers Mitsuru Yaida and Hideyuki Suganami previously programmed Contra III: The Alien Wars (1992) for the Super NES at Konami. The team felt the Genesis's processor was more powerful, capable, and friendly to experimentation than other consoles. This led them to consider it more suited for action games and the sophisticated graphical effects they were looking to create. The team implemented heavy visual effects in an exercise in design experimentation (not an effort to push the hardware). Some of that experimenting was done with the system's sprite rotation and scaling capabilities, which evoked a sense of depth. The Genesis had its limitations however, as it could only display 64 colors on screen at once. The team placed extra effort on coloring to compensate. Early backgrounds were drawn with a 16 color palette, but they looked desolate, so ultimately two palettes with 32 colors were used. The team also used programming tricks to make the scenery appear like three to four layers were present, although the Genesis only supports two. The team approached Gunstar Heroes with an \\"anything goes\\" concept, that led to many ambitious ideas being implemented into the final game. One such concept was the weapon combination mechanic, which was conceived in the early planning stages. They experimented with weapon attributes until the end of development, and designed the game so players would continue discovering new weapons and devise new ways to complete stages. The processor also made articulated multi-limb enemies possible, like the boss \\"Seven Force,\\" which was programmed by Nami along with all other bosses. Because moving around large sprites was difficult due to limited video RAM, Seven Force was built by combining circles and squares to make one large character. Maegawa claims the game could have never worked on the Super NES because the boss animations required expanded computing power. The standard enemy characters, designed by Han, were drawn on the screen by combining a top and bottom sprite, allowing for more animation patterns with lower memory usage. Han was inspired by the game Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter (1993) to program the enemies manually rather than with mathematical algorithms. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). The game was 16 megabits but compressed to fit under 8.  Release  Although McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure was completed first, Treasure decided to wait and release Gunstar Heroes first because they wanted their debut to be an original game. It was nearly rejected for an American release by Sega of America, only being approved by Mac Senour, the last producer in the reviewing queue after 12 others rejected it. Senour believed the other producers dismissed the game because its small character sprites contrasted with the more popular large sprites at the time. Senour did ask Treasure to change one boss character because it looked too similar to Adolf Hitler. Gunstar Heroes was released in Japan on September 10, 1993, and released in the West the same month. Sega underestimated demand in Japan where their initial shipment was only 10,000 units. Meanwhile, Sega of America also ordered a small initial print run, as they were not typically confident in games from Sega of Japan. The game was not heavily promoted and spread by word of mouth. GameFan particularly enjoyed the game and published the first English interview with Maegawa. The game shipped in total around 70,000 copies in Japan, and 200,000 overseas. An arcade version was also released for the Sega Mega-Play arcade board. = Ports and re-releases = A Game Gear port was developed by M2. Sega asked M2 if they wanted to make a Game Gear game after being impressed by their Gauntlet port for the Genesis. M2 wanted to port The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy, but they were ultimately handed Gunstar Heroes. Since the Genesis version pushed hardware limitations, a Game Gear port was difficult. (Translation) The port had some changes, such as the Dice Palace being removed, and it ran at lower frame rate. It was released on March 24, 1995. Sega released Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box in 2006 in Japan, a compilation of Treasure games for the PlayStation 2 as part of their Sega Ages 2500 series. Included on the compilation were Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy (1994), and Alien Soldier (1995). The games are run through an emulator and include display options for filters and resolutions. The Japanese and international versions of each game were included, along with the Game Gear ports of Gunstar Heroes and Dynamite Headdy, and a Genesis prototype of Gunstar Heroes. A gallery is included with scans of the original instruction manuals, concept illustrations, and design documents. This compilation was released digitally on the PlayStation Store in 2012. The game was ported by M2 to the Nintendo 3DS in 2015 as part of Sega's line of 3D Classics. Gunstar Heroes was originally not considered for the series because converting the game's backgrounds into a layered 3D effect was thought to be impossible, but these perceived problems were later overcome. In addition to supporting stereoscopic 3D, the game features two new game modes. \\"Gunslinger\\" mode starts the player with a full arsenal of every weapon type and grants the ability to change shot stance at any time, and \\"Mega Life\\" mode starts the player with double the normal amount of health. The game also supports local cooperative play and includes both the Japanese and international versions. Gunstar Heroes has also been released on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Windows. A Sega Forever version for mobile devices was released in 2017. Reception Gunstar Heroes achieved greater recognition than Treasure anticipated. Electronic Gaming Monthly called it their \\"Game of the Month,\\" and the game placed first in Beep! Mega Drive's reader rankings in Japan. GameFan deemed it their \\"Game of the Year\\" and called it a new benchmark for action games. Mean Machines Sega wrote that Gunstar Heroes was setting a new standard for action games on the Genesis, calling it \\"a stunning title both in appearance and the gameplay it offers.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed, with one critic calling it \\"one of the most intense games I've seen on the home video game scene.\\" Both Sega Magazine and Sega Force felt the game was a must- buy for Genesis owners. The game was praised for its fast and furious action. Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"one of the most intense carts to date [...] nonstop intensity from beginning to end.\\" Mean Machines Sega agreed, commending the variety in level design and the \\"frantic, high-density blasting mayhem.\\" Sega Force believed the game's variety prevented it from falling into monotony, and instead, reinvigorated the platform genre. Computer and Video Games agreed, feeling gameplay customization options kept it feeling interesting and original. Some critics praised the player characters' acrobatics and attack maneuvers for adding excitement. GamePro called Gunstar Heroes \\"chaos in a cart\\" with \\"murderous action, excellent controls, and imaginative game design.\\" The game's two-player cooperative mode was praised, although some felt there was too much clutter on the screen to tell the player characters apart. The game's graphics were highlighted by several critics, with GamePro calling it \\"an assault on your senses.\\" Mean Machines Sega felt the sprite rotating and scaling overshadowed the abilities of the Super NES. Sega Magazine also liked the sprite scaling, and highlighted its use on the boss \\"Seven Force.\\" Other critics also felt the bosses were well animated and designed, with some also extending their comments to the player characters' animations as well. Computer and Video Games commended the graphical explosion effects, with other critics praising the sound effects they were paired with for enhancing the game's atmosphere. A critic from Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"one of the best looking carts I've seen from Sega in a while.\\" = Ports = Critics lauded the Game Gear port as a great 8-bit conversion. GameFan felt it was graphically advanced for a Game Gear game. Mean Machines Sega agreed, thinking that the graphics remained true to the 16-bit original despite greater system limitations. The 3DS version was praised for the added options and enhancements, with USgamer and Nintendo World Report calling it the best version of the game. The mobile version was criticized for being difficult to play with touch controls. Legacy Gunstar Heroes was listed as one of the best games ever made by several publications. Critics have called it a \\"classic\\" of the 16-bit era, with IGN writing that its pace and speed was \\"nearly unrivaled\\" at the time. Others called it one of the best Genesis games. Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"one of the best two-player games ever made.\\" USgamer wrote that its chaotic and brash nature made it the \\"quintessential classic-era Sega game\\" in contrast to the more gentle offerings from Nintendo. Nintendo World Report called it \\"an incredible accomplishment, both creatively and technically\\" for the Genesis. Both TouchArcade and GameSpy deemed it one of the best side-scrolling action games ever made. Being Treasure's debut game, Gunstar Heroes helped establish their reputation in the industry. Retro Gamer wrote that the game \\"blew open the state of 2D platform-shooters.\\" Developers at the time borrowed inspiration for titles like Vectorman (1995) and Shinobi III (1993). Treasure also began to build a following of loyal hardcore fans, which USgamer felt was earned by \\"a sense of integrity to Treasure's work you don't often see in games of that era.\\" 1UP.com wrote that between Gunstar Heroes and their other Genesis games, Treasure earned a reputation as a \\"master of hardcore action gaming.\\" Many of the design conventions Treasure used in Gunstar Heroes would return and became characteristic of Treasure's later work, such as a quirky sense of humor and action taken to a level of absurdity. A sequel was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005, Gunstar Super Heroes.

Some workers prefer the opposite arrangement, where vapors flow down the wall of the trap, and are sucked up the inner tube; this reduces blockage. In vacuum applications, a cold trap is a device that condenses all vapors except the permanent gases into a liquid or solid. The most common objective is to prevent vapors being evacuated from an experiment from entering a vacuum pump where they would condense and contaminate it. Particularly large cold traps are necessary when removing large amounts of liquid as in freeze drying. Cold traps also refer to the application of cooled surfaces or baffles to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a baffle or a section of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will be attached to the inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen, or by use of an electrically driven Peltier element, oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity. Applications Pumps that use oil either as their working fluid (diffusion pumps), or as their lubricant (mechanical rotary pumps), are often the sources of contamination in vacuum systems. Placing a cold trap at the mouth of such a pump greatly lowers the risk that oil vapours will backstream into the cavity. Cold traps can also be used for experiments involving vacuum lines such as small-scale very low temperature distillations/condensations. This is accomplished through the use of a coolant such as liquid nitrogen or a freezing mixture of dry ice in acetone or a similar solvent with a low melting point. When performed on a larger scale, this technique is called freeze-drying, and the cold trap is referred to as the condenser. Cold traps are also used in cryopump systems to generate hard vacua by condensing the major constituents of the atmosphere (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water) into their liquid or solid forms.  Hazards  Care should be taken when using a cold trap not to condense liquid oxygen (a light blue liquid) into the cold trap. Liquid oxygen is potentially explosive, and this is especially true if the trap has been used to trap solvent. Liquid oxygen can be condensed into a cold trap if a pump has sucked air through the trap when the trap is very cold, e.g. when cooled with liquid nitrogen. Besides oxygen, many hazardous gases emitted in reactions, e.g. sulfur dioxide, chloromethane, condense into cold traps. Construction thumb Cold traps (C in the figure) usually consist of two parts: The bottom is a large, thick round tube with ground-glass joints (B in the figure), and the second is a cap (A in the figure), also with ground-glass connections. The length of the tube is usually selected so that, when assembled, the total reached is about half the length of the tube. Arrangement Cold traps should be assembled such that the down tube is connected to the source of gas whilst the cap is connected to the source of vacuum.An Aldrich manifold including a preformed cold trap Reversing this, connecting the down tube to the source of vacuum, places the inlet of the vacuum directly above the condensate, increasing the chances of vapour phase condensate moving up the (uncooled) down tube (towards the pump) or, should the trap begin to fill to an appreciable volume, liquid phase condensate being pulled into the pump.

He is Class of 1916 Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Cornell University. His published works are in the fields of structuralism, literary theory and literary criticism. Background and career Culler attended Harvard for his undergraduate studies, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history and literature in 1966. After receiving a Rhodes scholarship, he attended St. John's College, Oxford University, where he earned a B. Phil (now M.

The thesis explored the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the criticism of the \\"Geneva School\\" using the ideas of Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, and Ferdinand de Saussure. Culler's \\"expanded, reorganized and rewritten\\" doctoral dissertation, \\"Structuralism: The Development of Linguistic Models and Their Application to Literary Studies,\\" became an influential prize-winning book, Structuralist Poetics (1975).Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics: Structuralism, Linguistics, and the Study of Literature (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1975), pp. viii-ix. In the years 1971 - 1974 he was married to the poet Veronica Forrest-Thomson Culler was Fellow in French and Director of Studies in Modern Languages at Selwyn College, Cambridge University, from 1969‚Äì1974, and Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and University Lecturer in French from 1974-77. He was Visiting Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Yale University in 1975. He is a past president of the Semiotic Society of America (1988), the American Comparative Literature Association (1999-2001), Secretary of the American Council of Learned Societies (2013-17), and Chair of the New York Council for the Humanities (2016-17. He has been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001-) and the American Philosophical Society (2006-). Currently, he is Class of 1916 Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Cornell University. Culler is married to deconstructionist critic Cynthia Chase. Major works Culler's Structuralist Poetics: Structuralism, Linguistics and the Study of Literature won the James Russell Lowell Prize from the Modern Language Association of America in 1976 for an outstanding book of criticism. Structuralist Poetics was one of the first introductions to the French structuralist movement available in English. Culler's contribution to the Very Short Introductions series, Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction, received praise for its innovative technique of organization. It has been translated into 26 languages, including Kurdish, Latvian, and Albanian. Instead of chapters on critical schools and their methods, the book's eight chapters address issues and problems of literary theory. In The Literary in Theory (2007) Culler discusses the notion of Theory and literary history's role in the larger realm of literary and cultural theory. He defines Theory as an interdisciplinary body of work including structuralist linguistics, anthropology, Marxism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and literary criticism. His Theory of the Lyric (2015) approaches the Western lyric tradition, from Sappho to Ashbery, exploring the major parameters of the genre and contesting two dominant models of the lyric: lyric as the intense expression of the author's affective experience, and lyric as the fictional representation of the speech act of a persona. Both these models, according to Culler, are extremely limiting and ignore what is most distinctive and exciting about lyric poems. Contributions to critical theory Culler believes that the linguistic-structuralist model can help \\"formulate the rules of particular systems of convention rather than simply affirm their existence.\\" He posits language and human culture as similar. In Structuralist Poetics Culler warns against applying the technique of linguistics directly to literature. Rather, the \\"'grammar' of literature\\" is converted into literary structures and meaning. Structuralism is defined as a theory resting on the realization that if human actions or productions have meaning there must be an underlying system that makes this meaning possible, since an utterance has meaning only in the context of a preexistent system of rules and conventions. Culler proposes that we use literary theory not to try to understand a text but rather to investigate the activity of interpretation. In several of his works, he speaks of a reader who is particularly \\"competent.\\" In order to understand how we make sense of a text, Culler identifies common elements that different readers treat differently in different texts. He suggests there are two classes of readers, \\"the readers as field of experience for the critic (himself a reader)\\" and the future readers who will benefit from the work the critic and previous readers have done. Culler's critics complain of his lack of distinction between literature and the institution of writing in general. John R. Searle has described Culler's presentation of deconstruction as making \\"Derrida look both better and worse than he really is;\\" better in glossing over some of the more intellectually murky aspects of deconstruction and worse in largely ignoring the major philosophical progenitors of Derrida's thought, namely Husserl and Heidegger.Searle, John R. \\"The Word Turned Upside Down\\" The New York Review of Books, Volume 30, Number 16, October 27, 1983 Bibliography Selected publications: * Flaubert: The Uses of Uncertainty.

Note that as long as the definition of the pulse function is only motivated by its behavior in the time-domain experience, there is no reason to believe that the oscillatory interpretation (i.e. the Fourier transform function) should be intuitive, or directly understood by humans. However, some aspects of the theoretical result may be understood intuitively, as finiteness in time domain corresponds to an infinite frequency response. (Vice versa, a finite Fourier transform will correspond to infinite time domain response.) Relation to the triangular function We can define the triangular function as the convolution of two rectangular functions: :\\\\mathrm{tri} = \\\\mathrm{rect} * \\\\mathrm{rect}.\\\\, Use in probability Viewing the rectangular function as a probability density function, it is a special case of the continuous uniform distribution with a = -1/2, b = 1/2.

Background Guzzo was educated at the University of Ottawa. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree and a law degree. He practiced as a lawyer with the firm of Chiarelli and Guzzo from 1969 to 1976, was a provincial court judge from 1978 to 1989. He practiced for a short time as counsel with the firm Kelly, Howard, Santini and then operated a private practice in Ottawa until 1999. He also served as a director of the city's Riverside Hospital. Politics Guzzo was elected for a three-year term to Ottawa City Council as an alderman for Capital Ward in 1969. In the provincial election of 1971, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Ottawa Centre, and came within 182 votes of defeating future New Democratic Party leader Michael Cassidy. From 1974 to 1976, he served as a Councillor in the regional municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. Guzzo ran for the Ontario legislature a second time in the provincial election of 1995, and defeated Liberal incumbent Yvonne O'Neill by about 1,500 votes in the riding of Ottawa‚ÄîRideau.

He was an exact contemporary of Monteverdi, and represented a transitional phase in German Lutheran music from the polyphonic Renaissance style to the early Baroque. Life He was born in Reichenberg (now Liberec, in the Czech Republic, north of Prague near the border with Germany), and probably received his early training there, though little information is available about his early life. By the early 1590s he was in Bautzen, where he wrote a school textbook, and in 1593 he received a degree from the University of Wittenberg. In 1594 he moved to Leipzig, and in 1597 he acquired the post of Kantor at Zittau, where he probably taught the young Melchior Franck.Blankenburg, Grove His next post, one he held for the rest of his life, was as Kantor to Freiberg Cathedral. While he was able to keep his position, the Thirty Years' War was disruptive to his life, and most of his children, of four different marriages, died due to the hardships imposed by the war. Works Demantius was a hugely prolific composer, though many of his works have been lost. Stylistically he was a successor to Lassus, who was also working in Germany during the first part of Demantius's life. He wrote most of his music before the Thirty Years' War; it is probable that the hardships of the war, including lack of performing musicians, made it difficult to compose and publish.Blankenburg/Schr√∂der, Grove online In the realm of sacred music Demantius wrote motets, masses, Magnificat settings, psalm settings, hymns, and a splendid setting of the St. John Passion, one of the most significant passion settings of the late Renaissance. This work, for six voices, is considered to be the last in the development of the German motet passion; those composed later were to be of the more dramatic kind, culminating in the St John Passion of J.S. Bach. Demantius's setting includes a setting of Isaiah chapter 53 in addition to the usual text from the Gospel of St. John. His motets are of a late Renaissance type, and all Lutheran; some are in German and others Latin. They are conservative in that they avoid some of the Italian Baroque innovations such as the concertato style and the basso continuo, both of which were becoming widely used in Germany by 1610; but he also created a highly individual musical language using traditional forms and means, quite distinct from the Palestrinian polyphony adopted by the other composers of the time commonly regarded as \\"conservative.\\" He also wrote secular music, both vocal and instrumental, including threnodies, dances, epithalamia, and numerous other occasional works. Most likely he wrote the poetry for his own music. As a music theoretician he is famous for compiling the first dictionary of musical terms in the German language. He also published a textbook for teaching music in school, Forma musices, in 1592, at Bautzen. References and further reading * Walter Blankenburg, \\"Christoph Demantius\\".

This differs from the view that there is no essential difference between the pain of non-human animals and that of human beings (see Peter Singer), and also differs from the view that the pain of animals is a morally relevant consideration, but is not morally decisive (See Bonnie Steinbock). It is important to note that Baxter is not antipathetic toward non-human animals; in fact, he points out that many things that are in the interests of animals (and the larger environment for that matter) are in fact also in the best interests of humans as well. In this sense we have obligations to how we treat non-human animals, but the grounds is only because of the respective impact on human beings. Baxter states that the way to measure these humans interests are in terms of a cost benefit analysis, where cost doesn't necessarily mean uniquely monetary costs.

MP3.com, Inc., 92 F. Supp. 2d 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) was a landmark case before Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York concerning the Internet. The case concerned MP3.com's unauthorized duplication of essentially every music CD ever made for the purposes of launching a service entitled My.MP3.com or \\"Beam-it\\", which allowed users to access their private music collections online from anywhere in the world. With this decision, the court drew a distinction between time shifting and space shifting, which had previously been allowed, and \\"virtual\\" space shifting as practiced by My.MP3.com. Before accessing a song from MP3.com's servers, a subscriber first had to \\"prove\\" that he already owned the CD by placing his copy of the commercial CD into his computer's CD-ROM drive for several seconds or by purchasing the CD from one of defendant's cooperating online retailers. Id. However, it was MP3.com doing the copying from the CDs onto their servers, and the court found this copying not a fair use. UMG argued, in part, that the copying was not covered by fair use because entire CDs were copied (instead of excerpts) and that the use was a commercial one (even though no fee was charged, it was supported by ad revenue). MP3.com defended, in part, that \\"consumer protection\\" concepts supported MP3.com's unauthorized use of the intellectual property of the major record labels and music publishers. In ruling, the court indicated that \\"stripped to its essence, defendant's 'consumer protection' argument amounts to nothing more than a bald claim that (the) defendant should be able to misappropriate (the) plaintiff's property simply because there is a consumer demand for it. This hardly appeals to the conscience of equity.\\" The resulting litigation and judgments against MP3.com, totaling over $53 million, pushed MP3.com into severe financial difficulties which were averted by a merger with Vivendi Universal.

It has long been believed that the game was designed using the Madden '93 engine, but was actually made from scratch, and features a different take on football, where the games resemble a war as much as a sporting competition. Electronic Arts ported the game to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as part of EA Replay. It was released in the United States on November 14, 2006. The PSP allowed a higher resolution for the game than seen on the Genesis, therefore bringing greater graphics to the game when played on a television screen via the new PSP Slim & Lite's output capabilities.  Gameplay  In-game screenshot The game deviates from usual American football simulations in several ways. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where radiation has caused the human race to mutate and the dead to rise from the grave. The game instruction manual states that the exact causes of the upheaval have been lost or corrupted, due to (among many things) the chaos of an alien invasion, spin control, a sloppy filing system set up by a temp, and what appears to be barbecue sauce. Land mines, fire pits, and other hazards (such as arenas being open to interplanetary space) litter the field, which can be made of rock, ice, toxic waste or rubber, and players can lose health or die during the run of play (upon which they will fumble). Teams have special Nasty Audible plays, which may be violent if not lethal, and may constitute cheating. Examples include exploding balls, invisibility, electric shocks, jet packs, or attacking the referee or opposition quarterback en masse, with the intent of killing him. Killing enough players may force an opposing team to forfeit, should it find itself with an insufficient number of players to continue (killed players may remain dead for only a single play, a match, or an entire season, depending on settings chosen by the player or players). Each team can bribe the referee twice per game (once in each half), after which the bribed referee will award arbitrary penalties in favor of the team which bribed him (e.g. a 5-yard penalty for crying), at the expense of the opposing team. The team being penalized may kill the referee (via a \\"nasty audible\\") at the expense of another penalty for \\"Ref Bashing\\". Referee deaths may also occur accidentally, with such causes including being caught in the middle of a pileup or nudged into a mine, and these are not penalized. In the event of a referee's death, a replacement is immediately provided. Other penalties include offsides (encroachment also counts as this penalty), illegal kicks, delay of game, quarterback bashing, and pass interference. All of these penalties are 5-yard penalties except pass interference, which is an automatic first down. Game modes can take place in the form of a single match or a full- season mode. Winning the championship game in season mode results in the losing team exploding spontaneously, and the winning team's MVP perishing by induction into the \\"Hole of Flame\\", the induction ceremony of which entitles the game referees to snatch the MVP and stuff him into a firepit.  Teams  Teams are composed of aliens, skeletons, robots, trolls, and superhumans. Seven players are on the field for each team, instead of the usual eleven. Many of the teams are based on real life teams, with names like the Deathskin Razors and the Midway Monsters. Players also have similar parody names, like Bones Jackson (Bo Jackson), K.T. Slayer (Lawrence Taylor), Joe Magician (Joe Montana), Scary Ice (Jerry Rice), and Grim McSlam (Jim McMahon). However, despite all the death and destruction, the competition aspect is still high, and requires much strategy, especially compared to games like NFL Blitz.

A basketball game, Mutant League Basketball, was in development, but it was never released. These games were also used as the basis for an animated series, which aired from 1994 to 1996. The game inspired a one-off series in the British children's comic Sonic the Comic. The story, entitled \\"Bring Me the Head of Coach Brikka,\\" ran for 6 episodes in 1994. In the Xbox 360 version of the video game Madden NFL 09, there is an achievement worth 50 gamerscore titled \\"Midway Monster\\". The achievement is unlocked by creating a player named \\"Bones Jackson\\" and placing him on the Chicago Bears. A \\"spiritual successor\\" called Mutant Football League was developed by Digital Dreams Entertainment for the PC, Xbox One, and PS4. This re-imagining was led by Michael Mendheim, the original creator and lead designer of the Mutant League series.

Kennedy batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He is the son of former major league player and manager Bob Kennedy. Born in Euclid, Ohio, Kennedy attended St. Mary's High School (Phoenix, Arizona) before playing college baseball at Florida State University. He was a two-time All-American and Sporting News College Player of the Year in 1976. Kennedy was inducted into the FSU Athletics Hall of Fame in 1982. In a 14-year major league career, Kennedy hit .264 with 113 home runs and 628 RBI in 1491 games. Kennedy tied Johnny Bench's NL mark of 40 doubles in a season in 1982. That same year, Kennedy won the Silver Slugger Award. He appeared in four All-Star Games (1981, 1983, 1985, and 1987). He also played in two World Series, with the Padres in 1984 and with the Giants in 1989. Terry and his father, Bob, became the first father and son duo to drive in runs in a World Series when Terry drove in two against the Tigers in 1984 in his first at bat. Throughout most of his career, Kennedy wore #16, which he was assigned on his first day in major league camp with the Cardinals. When he came to the Orioles, he could not get #16 because veteran pitcher Scott McGregor already had the number, so he wore #15 during his time with them. He reverted to #16 during his time with the Giants, during which he took part in the earthquake-interrupted 1989 World Series. After his playing days, Kennedy managed, coached, and instructed in the minor leagues for the St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal Expos, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, as well as the Independent Leagues. Kennedy was voted Manager of the Year twice, including Baseball America Manager of the Year in 1998, when he led the Iowa Cubs to a first-place finish. Terry is a scout with the Chicago Cubs.

It is known as .275 Rigby in the United Kingdom. It was developed by Paul Mauser of the Mauser company in 1892 and adopted as a military cartridge by Spain in 1893.Jim Wilson \\"A Perfectly Delightful Cartridge: 7√ó57 mm Mauser\\" American Rifleman November 2009 pp.53‚Äì55 It was subsequently adopted by several other countries as the standard military cartridge, and although now obsolete as a military cartridge, it remains in widespread international use as a sporting round. Many sporting rifles in this calibre were made by British riflemakers, among whom John Rigby was prominent; and, catering for the British preference for calibres to be designated in inches, Rigby called this chambering the .275 bore after the measurement of a 7 mm rifle's bore across the lands. History Paul Mauser visited the Kingdom of Spain in 1892 after the delivery of trial rifles in 1891 and brought with him a new rifle designed to use a new cartridge of 7 mm caliber. Like the 7.65√ó53mm Mauser introduced in 1889, he had developed the 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge for use with the new smokeless propellant, introduced as Poudre B in the 1886 pattern 8mm Lebel, which started a military rifle ammunition revolution. At the time of its development 7√ó57mm Mauser was a high-performance smokeless-powder cartridge. The Mauser Model 1892 rifle turned out to be a transitional design that was manufactured in limited numbers for the Spanish Army. It was quickly improved to the Mauser Model 1893 featuring a new internal box magazine where the cartridges were stored in a staggered column. The Spaniards were so impressed with the Mauser Model 1892 and 1893 rifles and their new 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge that they not only ordered rifles and ammunition with Mauser, but also awarded him the Grand Cross of the Spanish Military Order of Merit, the highest decoration Mauser ever received.Mauser Rifles and Pistols by W. H. B. Smith Cartridge dimensions The 7√ó57mm cartridge has 3.90 ml (60 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions. 400px 7√ó57mm maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ‚âà 20.55 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 220 mm (1 in 8.66 in), 4 grooves, diameter of lands = , diameter of grooves = , land width = and the primer type is large rifle. European 7 mm cartridges all have 7.24 mm (0.285 in) grooves diameter. American 7 mm cartridges have 7.21 mm (0.284 in) grooves diameter. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes √† Feu Portatives) rulings the 7√ó57mm case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.C.I.P. TDCC datasheet 7 x 57 The SAAMI maximum average pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is piezo pressure or 46,000 CUP. Although this lower specification is in deference to the purportedly weaker actions of the older Mauser 93 and 95 rifles which are still in circulation, this concern is misplaced, as the original ammunition developed for, and issued with, the M93 Spanish Mauser produced an average pressure of 50,370 CUP in those rifles. 7√ó57mmR (rimmed) A rimmed cartridge was developed from the 7√ó57mm shortly after its introduction for use in break-action rifles and combination guns. A rimmed cartridge greatly simplifies the issues of designing an extractor, particularly in a combination gun or \\"drilling\\" which must also be designed to extract rimmed shotgun shells. While various modern break-action and single- shot rifle and pistol designs have been developed that can reliably extract rimless cartridges, most of these date from the 1970s or later. While the external dimensions of the two versions are nearly identical other than the rim, there are differences in the internal design. In particular, the cartridge web, the area immediately above the rim on the rimmed version or the rebate on the rimless version, is thinner in the rimmed case, and some authorities recommend limiting the rimmed cartridge to 41,000 CUP because of this. 7√ó57mmR hunting cartridge 7√ó57mmR cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).C.I.P. TDCC datasheet 7 x 57 R Sporting round 7√ó57mm hunting cartridge The ballistics of the 7√ó57mm became popular with deer and plains game hunters. The relatively flat trajectory and manageable recoil ensured its place as a sportsman's cartridge. The 7√ó57mm can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. This made it popular in Africa, where it was used on animals up to and including elephants, for which it was particularly favoured by noted ivory hunter W.D.M. \\"Karamojo\\" Bell, who shot about 800 African elephants with 1893 pattern 7√ó57mm military ball ammunition using Rigby Mauser 98 rifles, when most ivory hunters were using larger- caliber rifles. Bell selected the cartridge for moderate recoil, and used long round-nosed military full metal jacket bullets for reliable penetration. Bell sectioned an elephant skull to determine the size and location of the brain, and used careful aim to ensure bullet placement in the brain. The 7√ó57mm was also the favoured cartridge of Eleanor O'Connor, wife of famous hunter and author Jack O'Connor. Eleanor accompanied her husband on multiple hunting expeditions all over the world, killing small and large game with the 7√ó57mm. Though not as popular today, the 7√ó57mm is still produced by most major ammunition manufacturers and many modern rifles are available chambered for the cartridge. The 7√ó57mm round was also used by the Indian hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett to put down the infamous man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag besides a few other Man-Eaters of Kumaon. Corbett's writings mention using the .275 Mauser-Rigby rifle with attached torch to despatch the leopard on a dark summer night in May 1926. For man-eating tigers, Corbett preferred a double-barrelled .450/400 Nitro Express rifle but retained the Mauser-Rigby as a backup weapon. Able to handle a wide range of projectile weights, easy to reload, mild in recoil and accurate, the 7√ó57 offers a lot. This is well known to hunters, through both personal experience and the reading of a well-documented track record extending back more than 100 years. Rifle metallic silhouette shooters are also discovering the versatility and competitiveness of the 7√ó57. Military use The military of the Kingdom of Spain adopted the Mauser Model 1893 rifle. It was chambered for the new 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge. The original cartridge featured a long, round-nose, full- metal-jacketed bullet with a muzzle velocity of about with muzzle energy from a barreled rifle. For the late 19th century, these ballistics were impressive, and the loading provided a fairly flat trajectory combined with excellent penetration. At the same time, it exhibited relatively modest free recoil. That was a combination of attributes that made it popular with both soldiers and sportsmen alike. The qualities of the 7√ó57mm as a military round were shown in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. At the commencement of the American assault on the strategic Cuban city of Santiago, 750 Spanish troops defended positions on San Juan and Kettle Hills. The attacking force numbered approximately 6,600 American soldiers, most of them armed with then-new smokeless-powder Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifle in .30-40 Krag caliber,Springfield Model 1892-99 and supported by artillery and Gatling gun fire. Though the assault was successful, the Americans soon realized that they had suffered more than 1,400 casualties, nearly 20 per cent of their forces. A U.S. board of investigation later concluded that the casualties were primarily due to the superior firepower of the Spanish Model 1893 Mauser rifles. During the Second Boer War in South Africa, British authorities were obliged to re-evaluate rifle and ammunition design and tactics after facing Boer sharpshooters and snipers armed with Mauser Model 1895 rifles firing 7√ó57mm rounds with withering effectiveness, easily outranging the .303 British cartridge as regards accurate long-range fire.Mauser Model 95 / Plezier Mauser 7√ó57mm The .303 British cartridge at that time was still using cordite propellant, in contrast to the Mauser's higher-performance ballistite type smokeless powder. The British modernized the .303 British cartridge to the Mark 7 variant with a \\"spitzer\\" bullet, and updated their rifle to the Short Magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield No. 1 Mk III. Military ammunition The oldest 1893 pattern military ball ammunition was loaded with a long round-nosed bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel. It had a maximum range of .FN Mauser Model 98 Rifle and Carbine Operator's Manual page 28 In 1893 this ballistic performance made it the high-performance service cartridge champion of its day when compared to other 1893 pattern smokeless-powder cartridges such as the 8mm Lebel, .303 British, and 8√ó50mmR Mannlicher. In 1913, following the lead of French and German Army commands in developing the spitzer or pointed-tip bullet shape, the Spanish ordnance authorities issued a redesigned 7√ó57mm cartridge with a spitzer bullet (7mm Cartucho para Mauser Tipo S).The Spanish Modelo 1893 Mauser Rifle by Paul Scarlata ‚Ä¢ Shooting Times ‚Ä¢ September 23, 2010 It was loaded with a spitzer bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel.

The new spitzer bullet style was partially responsible for the cartridge's improved performance as it significantly reduced air drag within normal combat ranges and withstood higher accelerations in the barrel. Reverse engineering the trajectory from the previous sentence indicates a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.33. After that military ball ammunition loaded with a spitzer bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel became available.

Use as a parent case The .257 Roberts uses the 7√ó57mm Mauser as its parent cartridge. The 6mm Remington is also based on the 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge. Wildcats The 7√ó57mm Mauser is also used as the parent case for a host of modified variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. These cartridges are known as wildcat cartridges. The US wildcat cartridge developer P.O. Ackley developed several 7√ó57mm Mauser based wildcat cartridges.P.O. Ackley's wildcats The 7√ó57mm Mauser Ackley Improved is an alternate version of the 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge with 40 degree shoulder. This wildcat was designed to be easily made by rechambering existing firearms, and fire forming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. Dies for this wildcat chambering are readily available. The .228 Ackley Magnum is also based on the 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge but is also necked down to .228 caliber (5.79 mm). Bullets in this caliber are hard to find but provide greater weight than .223 caliber bullets, up to 100 grains (6.5 g), without excessively quick twist rate. The .257 Roberts Ackley Improved is a second generation wildcat cartridge based on the .257 Roberts cartridge.

The welts are usually itchy and often the hands and feet will become itchy and swollen as well. Hives vary in size from about 7mm in diameter to as big as about 27mm diameter or larger. This disorder, or perhaps two disorders with the same clinical manifestations, can be inherited (familial cold urticaria) or acquired (primary acquired cold urticaria). The acquired form is most likely to occur between ages 18‚Äì25, although it can occur as early as 5 years old in some cases. Life-threatening risks include suffocation resulting from pharyngeal angioedema induced by cold foods or beverages, drowning after shock from swimming in cold water and anaphylactic shock.  Types  Cold urticaria may be divided into the following types: =Primary cold contact urticaria= Primary cold contact urticaria is a cutaneous condition characterized by wheals, and occurs in rainy, windy weather, and after swimming in cold water and after contact with cold objects, including ice cubes. =Secondary cold contact urticaria= Secondary cold contact urticaria is a cutaneous condition characterized by wheals, due to serum abnormalities such as cryoglobulinemia or cryofibrinogenemia are extremely rare, and are then associated with other manifestations such as Raynaud's phenomenon or purpura. =Reflex cold urticaria= Reflex cold urticaria is a cutaneous condition in which generalized cooling of the body induces widespread welting. =Familial cold urticaria= Familial cold urticaria (also properly known as familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, FCAS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, fever/chills and arthralgias elicited by exposure to cold - sometimes temperatures below 22 ¬∞C (72 ¬∞F).James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . It has been mapped to CIAS1 and is a slightly milder member of the disease family including Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome and NOMID. It is rare and is estimated as having a prevalence of 1 per million people and mainly affects Americans and Europeans. FCAS is one of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) caused by mutations in the CIAS1/NALP3 (aka NLRP3) gene at location 1q44. The disease was described in The Lancet Volume 364 by Hoffman H.M. et al. The effect of FCAS on the quality of life of patients is far reaching. A survey of patients in the United States in 2008 found, \\"To cope with their underlying disease and to try to avoid symptomatic, painful, flares patients reported limiting their work, school, family, and social activities. Seventy-eight percent of survey participants described an impact of the disease on their work, including absenteeism and impaired job advancement; frequently, they quit their job as a consequence of their disease\\". Treatment using anakinra (Kineret) has been shown effective for FCAS, although this does mean daily injections of the immunosuppressant into an area such as the lower abdomen. The monoclonal antibody canakinumab (Ilaris) is also used.  Signs and symptoms  Hives on the back from exposure to cold air on an individual with cold allergy. The hives were induced by riding a stationary bike shirtless for an hour next to a door cracked open on a cool day. The temperature of the air flowing in was around 10C (50F). The lighter band at chest height was covered by a heart rate monitor strap. When the body is exposed to the cold in individuals afflicted by the condition, hives appear and the skin in the affected area typically becomes itchy. Hives result from dilation of capillaries which allow fluid to flow out into the surrounding tissue which is the epidermis. They resolve when the body absorbs this fluid. The border of a hive is described as polycyclic, or made up of many circles, and changes as fluid leaks out and then is absorbed. Pressing on a hive causes the skin to blanch distinguishing it from a bruise or papule. Hives can last for a few minutes or a few days, and vary from person to person. Also, a burning sensation occurs. A serious reaction is most likely to occur for patients where the hives occur with less than 3 minutes of exposure (during a cold test).  Cause  The hives are a histamine reaction in response to cold stimuli, including a drastic drop in temperature, cold air, and cold water. There are many causes for cold hives, most are idiopathic (meaning they have no known cause). Some rare conditions can cause cold hives, and it can be useful to test for these conditions if the cold hives are in any way unusual. Scientists from the USA National Institutes of Health have identified a genetic mutation in three unrelated families that causes a rare immune disorder characterized by excessive and impaired immune function: immune deficiency, autoimmunity, inflammatory skin disorders and cold-induced hives (cold urticaria). > \\"The mutation discovered occurs in a gene for phospholipase C-gamma2 > (PLCG2), an enzyme involved in the activation of immune cells. The > investigators have named the condition PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency > and immune dysregulation, or PLAID.\\"News published on the National Institute > of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) website (Jan. 11, 2012) Risk factors *Cold weather/snow: Exposure to cold or cool air can quickly trigger a reaction; for example going down the \\"cold\\" aisle in a supermarket. * Sweat: A reaction may even occur on a warm day when there is sweat on the skin, since the reaction is triggered by skin temperature, not core temperature. If there is a breeze it will rapidly cool the skin and create hives. * Cold/cool IV lines: While in the hospital, inserting IV lines that have been refrigerated or are cool into individuals who are allergic to cold temperature can/may result in pain within the limb the IV is placed and a line of hives may appear within a radius of 6-8 inches from the IV site in the pattern of a line going up the limb. * Swimming: Swimming can be especially dangerous as the rapid heart rate combined with the onset of hives can lead to hypotension. * Air conditioning: Entering a cool building during a summer day can result in an allergic reaction to exposed areas of skin, congestion from breathing the cool air and possibly feeling fatigued. * Cold foods/drinks: Eating or drinking cold or cool substances such as ice cream or even iced tea may result in the individuals tongue and surrounding tissues swelling and to suffocation. * Cool/cold surfaces: Sitting on sidewalks which are cool, leaning on or grabbing a cold pole will result in hives forming on the area which had contact with the cool surfaces. * Restriction of blood flow: Typing or other activities which tense muscles and reduce blood flow can cool the body parts enough to cause itching and hives. * Blood flow: While putting hands or feet in hot water nails turn purple/white until the body gets used to the temperature.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is typically obtained by an allergist or other licensed practitioner performing a cold test. During the cold test, a piece of ice is held against the forearm, typically for 3‚Äì4 minutes. A positive result is a specific looking mark of raised red hives. The hives may be the shape of the ice, or it may radiate from the contact area of the ice. However, while these techniques assist in diagnosis, they do not provide information about temperature and stimulation time thresholds at which patients will start to develop symptoms, which is essential because it can establish disease severity and monitor the effectiveness of treatment.  Treatment  The first-line therapy in ColdU, as recommended by EAACI/GA2 LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines, is symptomatic relief with second-generation H1- antihistamines. if standard doses are ineffective increasing up to 4-fold is recommended to control symptoms. The second-generation H1-antihistamine, rupatadine, was found to significantly reduce the development of chronic cold urticaria symptom without an increase in adverse effects using 20 and 40 mg. Allergy medications containing antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), Loratadine (Claritin), cyproheptadine (Periactin), and fexofenadine (Allegra) may be taken orally to prevent and relieve some of the hives (depending on the severity of the allergy). For those who have severe anaphylactic reactions, a prescribed medicine such as doxepin, which is taken daily, should help to prevent and/or lessen the likelihood of a reaction and thus, anaphylaxis. There are also topical antihistamine creams which are used to help relieve hives in other conditions, but there is not any documentation stating they will relieve hives induced by cold temperature. Cold hives can result in a potentially serious, or even fatal, systemic reaction (anaphylactic shock). People with cold hives may have to carry an injectable form of epinephrine (like Epi-pen or Twinject) for use in the event of a serious reaction. The best treatment for this allergy is avoiding exposure to cold temperature. Studies have found that Omalizumab (Xolair) may be an effective and safe treatment for cold urticaria in patients who do not sufficiently respond to standard treatments. Ebastine has been proposed as an approach to prevent acquired cold urticaria.

Biography The Portland, Oregon native was a short- lived member of Dr. Mastermind, featuring former Wild Dogs vocalist Matt McCourt, before joining his brother, vocalist Tim Lachman, in another local band, Gargoyle, in 1988. Gargoyle would move to Los Angeles, California in 1990 where the band morphed into State of the Art recording an acclaimed three-song demo before disbanding in 1993. The Lachman brothers next hooked up with Canada native Shane Gaalaas, then the drummer for Swedish guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen, and recorded another demo under the name Eleventh Hour. In 1996, Lachman and Gaalaas teamed up with former Last Rites and World In Pain members A.J. Cavalier (later to join SOiL) and Jeff Mohr to form Diesel and cut a 6-song demo.\\\\- Diesel page at Metal-Archives.com Parting ways with Mohr and adding Rich Gonzales, formerly with Recipients Of Death, on bass, the band would change their name to Diesel Machine in time for the release of their debut album, Torture Test, in 2000. By then Lachman had already been picked as one of the guitar players for Halford, the solo band of then ex-Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford. With Halford, Lachman co-wrote and recorded Resurrection (2000), Live Insurrection (2001), and another studio album, Crucible (2002). Lachman also collaborated with Tommy Victor of Prong on the song 'Initiation' which appeared on the band's 2002 100% Live album and was re-recorded as 'Embrace the Depth' for Scorpio Rising. 2003 saw the release of a Halford EP titled Fourging The Furnace, released in Japan only. That same year Rob Halford announced that he would return to Judas Priest. Lachman had already left the Halford band in November 2002 \\\\- Patrick Lachman Leaves Halford! to join former Pantera guitarist \\"Dimebag Darrell\\" Abbott and his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott, in a new band called Damageplan as their vocalist. Their debut album, New Found Power, was released in 2004; in addition, the song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains, appeared on The Punisher soundtrack. The band had recorded several songs for a second album, however on December 8, 2004 during a Damageplan show at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, Darrell was fatally shot on stage by 25-year-old mentally ill ex-Marine Nathan Gale, who was shot and killed by police officer James Niggemeyer minutes later.\\\\- Damageplan Singer Yelled 'Call 9-1-1' Before Jumping Off Stage After the untimely demise of Damageplan, Lachman put together a new band called The Mercy Clinic in 2005 with guitarists Brian Harrah (Professional Murder Music) and Josh Stinson (Drist), bassist Steed Najera (Triple Seven), and drummer Bevan Davies (Danzig, Comes With The Fall, Jerry Cantrell). Over the course of the next couple of years the group would write and demo upwards of 20 songs and played frequent shows in the L.A. area but ultimately failed to land a record deal. Subsequently, the project was put on hold. On February 18, 2005 Lachman performed with the surviving members of Alice in Chains at a benefit for tsunami relief in Seattle, Washington filling in for their late lead singer Layne Staley along with fellow vocalists Maynard James Keenan (Tool), Wes Scantlin (Puddle of Mudd), and Ann Wilson (Heart).

Founded by Harold R. Steele, the company owned 101 radio stations in Canada (making it the second-largest radio conglomerate in Canada behind Bell Media) particularly in Newfoundland and Labrador, and Alberta, as well as two television stations in Lloydminster. History The company dates back to 1980. The group's Newfoundland and Labrador division, known as Steele Communications, included all but two of the full-power commercial stations in that province. In the past, Newfoundland Capital acted as a conglomerate with interests in diverse industries such as newspapers and freight transportation. The firm owns one asset unrelated to the broadcasting industry: a hotel in Corner Brook, the Glynmill Inn, which is operated as part of the Steele Hotels group which includes other properties held directly by the Steele family. The Steele family also has private holdings in other industries which are entirely outside of the Newcap corporate umbrella. In 1986, NCCL received CRTC approval to acquire its first radio station, CHTN in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, from Northumberland Broadcasting Ltd. By 2008, Newcap would own over 70 radio stations, and flipped many radio stations from the AM band to the FM band. In July 2008, Newcap announced a deal to trade CFDR in Halifax to Rogers Media in exchange for CIGM in Sudbury. Both stations were the sole remaining AM stations in their respective markets, and in both cases the current owner already had the maximum permitted number of FM stations in the applicable market, whereas the acquirer only had a single FM station. Both companies successfully applied to move the stations to FM as part of the trade. Newcap flipped CIGM Sudbury to FM on August 25, 2009, and Rogers flipped CFDR Halifax to FM on August 7, 2009.\\"Local country station will be converted to FM\\", Northern Life, July 24, 2008.

These stations are predominantly in Alberta (including several stations in the Lloydminster region on the Alberta/Saskatchewan border), except for two stations in British Columbia. The company announced in May 2013 it was no longer planning to sell its assets in Western Canada. If such a sale had occurred, Newcap suggested that the proceeds might be used to either fund acquisitions \\"closer to [Newcap's] base in Atlantic Canada\\", pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders. On August 26, 2013, Newcap Radio announced it would acquire five former Astral Media radio stations in Toronto and Vancouver, CHBM-FM, CFXJ-FM, CKZZ-FM, CHHR-FM and CISL for $112 million.

Prior to Hole, Pfaff was the bassist and backing vocalist for Minneapolis- based band Janitor Joe. Pfaff returned to Janitor Joe for a short tour in the weeks before her death. She died of a heroin overdose in her Seattle apartment in June 1994. Early life and career Pfaff was born to Janet Pfaff and her first husband in Buffalo, New York. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried to Norman Pfaff, who adopted Kristen and gave her his surname. She had one younger brother, Jason, a musician. She studied classical piano and cello. After graduating from Catholic school Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart in 1985, Pfaff spent a short time in Europe and briefly attended Boston College before ultimately finishing at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Women's Studies. There, she also worked as a counselor for rape victims. She was a part of Restore of the Sexual Violence Program, which offered a crisis line, counseling services and training in self-defense programs. Pfaff also took part in the annual 24 Hour Rape Free Zone in 1990, and was quoted as saying the goal was \\"to draw attention to violence brought against women on campus and in the world\\". During this time she participated in the college radio station, Radio K, and she can be heard doing this in a short clip available on Soundcloud. While living in Minneapolis, Minnesota following her graduation, Pfaff taught herself to play bass guitar. She, guitarist/vocalist Joachim Breuer (formerly of Minneapolis band the Bastards) and drummer Matt Entsminger formed the band Janitor Joe in 1991. =Janitor Joe= The band's first single, \\"Hmong\\", was released in 1992. Later that year, they released the \\"Bullethead\\" single on picture disc, which was followed in 1993 with the \\"Boyfriend\\" 7-inch and Janitor Joe's debut album Big Metal Birds. One Janitor Joe track, \\"Under The Knife\\", can also be found on an OXO records 4-track EP, released in 1993. Janitor Joe were becoming a staple of the Minneapolis sound, influenced by the Pacific Northwest's early grunge sound and by the sharper, faster DC post-hardcore scene, as well as the stop- start distortion of the Butthole Surfers, Big Black and others on the Touch and Go label. Pfaff's playing style was central to Janitor Joe's relentless assault both live and on record, and she and Breuer both contributed songs to Big Metal Birds: \\"Both operate within easy reach of the line separating punishment and reward: Pfaff's contributions (the surly \\"Boys in Blue\\") tend to be slightly more spacious, while Breuer's (\\"One Eye,\\" for instance) stipulate that drummer Matt Entsminger maintain perpetual motion\\", wrote David Sprague of Trouser Press. The growing Minneapolis scene was beginning to attract music press attention in 1993. Amphetamine Reptile released a tour single, \\"Stinker\\", and Janitor Joe began to tour nationally. It was on one such tour in California that year that Pfaff was scouted by Eric Erlandson and Courtney Love of Hole, who were at the time looking for a new bassist. Love invited Pfaff to play with Hole; Pfaff declined and returned to Minneapolis, but Erlandson and Love continued to pursue her. =Hole= Pfaff, initially reluctant to leave Minneapolis and join Hole, reconsidered after advice from her father, Norman: \\"From a professional point of view, there was no decision\\", he later told Seattle Weekly, \\"because they're already on Geffen Records and already have this huge following in England... if you're wanting to move up the ladder, that's the way to go\\", although Kristen's mother Janet was more reluctant for her daughter to leave Minneapolis and Janitor Joe in favor of Seattle and Hole. Following international critical acclaim for their first, independent album, Pretty on the Inside, Hole had generated a great deal of major-label interest, eventually signing an eight-album deal with Geffen Records for a reported $3 million. In 1993, Pfaff moved to Seattle, Washington, to work with the other members of Hole on Live Through This, the major-label follow-up to Pretty on the Inside. The band's new line-up ‚Äì Love, Erlandson, Pfaff and Patty Schemel on drums ‚Äì entered the studio in early 1993 to begin rehearsals. \\"That's when we took off,\\" Eric Erlandson said of Pfaff joining. \\"All of a sudden we became a real band.\\" Later years  Pfaff's time in Seattle was a creatively rich period, and she formed close friendships with Eric Erlandson, and Kurt Cobain. While working on the platinum selling album Live Through This, Pfaff and Erlandson dated, and stayed together for most of 1993, remaining close even after splitting up. All was not well, however; while living in Washington's 'heroin capital', Pfaff developed a problem with drug use. \\"Everybody was doing it. Everyone, everyone. All our friends were junkies. It was ridiculous. Everybody in this town did dope\\", said Love of this period in the Seattle music scene. By most accounts, Pfaff's own drug use was relatively moderate: \\"Kristen...dabbled in drugs before she was in our band, in Minneapolis, but it was very light\\", Erlandson told Craig Marks of Spin. \\"She moved to Seattle and felt disconnected from everything, and she made friends, drug connections, which I told her not to do. The only way you can survive in this town is if you don't make those connections.\\" After the critical acclaim of Hole's Live Through This album, Pfaff decided to move back to Minnesota, partly because of her drug problem and partly because of creative differences within Hole.Love & Death See Chapter 10, page 235 Pfaff entered a Minneapolis detox center for heroin addiction in February 1994 and left Hole later that spring, to tour with Janitor Joe. \\"She went on tour... and when she came back from that, she was clean\\", says Erlandson. In the wake of Cobain's death in April 1994, Pfaff decided to leave Hole, and return to Minneapolis permanently. After her tour with Janitor Joe, however, Pfaff made plans to return to Seattle in order to retrieve the rest of her belongings, making the trip to Seattle on June 14, 1994. Death Kristen Pfaff's grave site. Section 6, Lot 45 of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo, New YorkOn June 16, 1994, at around 9:30 a.m., Pfaff was found dead in her Seattle apartment by Paul Erickson, a friend with whom she had planned to leave for Minneapolis that day. She was 27 years old. On the floor was a bag containing syringes and drug paraphernalia. Pfaff's death was attributed to \\"acute opiate intoxication\\". She died two months after Cobain, who was a close friend as well as the husband of Hole's frontwoman Courtney Love. Her father, Norman Pfaff, described her as \\"bright, personable, wonderful...very, very talented, smart, and she always seemed to be in control of her circumstances. Last night she wasn't.\\"Friday, June 17, 1994 edition of the Seattle Times In the book Love & Death, released April 2004, Kristen Pfaff's mother, Janet Pfaff, states she has never accepted the official story regarding her daughter's death. Janet was interviewed by authors Wallace and Halperin in August 2003. Eric Erlandson, the last person to see Pfaff alive before she overdosed on heroin, would later comment: \\"I admit, I made some stupid mistakes with some people, and people are dead because of my stupid mistakes. That's what I want to say. And I want to use that so that other people don't make the same mistakes that I made, and other people start understanding. I get emotional about this. We've all lost people.\\" Posthumous acknowledgements After a period of mourning, Hole recruited bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and dedicated their first show of an extensive touring period to Pfaff. Hole's 1997 retrospective compilation My Body, the Hand Grenade is also dedicated to her. On October 20, 1994, Janet Pfaff, Kristen's mother, accepted induction on her daughter's behalf into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame. \\"I'm proud to accept this award for Kristen and I know she would be happy to receive it,\\" Mrs. Pfaff said. \\"It's sad because Kristen wasn't here herself to enjoy the moment. You work so hard in the business to make it at the national level, and that's what Kristen did. I just wish she was here to enjoy it, and see how her hometown feels about her.\\" A local Minneapolis radio station, University of Minnesota's KUOM, has started a yearly $1,000 Memorial Scholarship in her name. The award is earmarked for \\"individuals active in the arts in the pursuit of their educational goals.\\" Portions from the proceeds of Hole's album sales have gone to the Kristen Pfaff Memorial Fund. A book about Pfaff's life and work as an activist and musician is forthcoming.

He was active from the days of the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) through the Northwest Indian Wars, after the United States achieved independence and settlers encroached on territory beyond the Appalachian Mountains and Ohio River. He became involved in the Western Confederacy of mostly Algonquian-speaking peoples, who were seeking to repel American settlers. The chief led his Lenape band from present-day Delaware westward, eventually to the White River area of present-day Muncie, Indiana. One of the most powerful war chiefs on the White River, Buckongahelas was respected by the Americans as a chief, although he did not have the position to do political negotiations. Early life and education Buckongahelas was born in present-day Delaware to Lenape parents. The British colonists called the people the Delaware, after the river, which was the heart of their territory. The Algonquian-speaking Lenape lived throughout the mid- Atlantic area. Buckongahelas in the Lenape language means a \\"Giver of Presents.\\" He was also known as Pachgantschihilas and Petchnanalas, meaning a \\"fulfiller\\" or \\"one who succeeds in all he undertakes.\\" Marriage and family Buckongahelas married as a young man and started his family. Under pressure from colonial settlers, he began to move his band westward. He was believed to have lived some time with his people in what is now Buckhannon in Upshur County, West Virginia.\\"Buckongahelas\\", The West Virginia Encyclopedia, ed. Ken Sullivan, West Virginia Humanities Council, 2006, accessed 26 October 2011 His son Mahonegon was killed there in June 1773 by Captain William White, a native of Frederick County, Virginia. Local legend states that the current Upshur County Courthouse was built over the grave of Mahonegon.McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil. Border Settlers of Northwestern Virginia, Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing, 1915 Local legend suggests Buckongahelas took revenge on White after trailing his son's killer for a period of nine years (1773‚Äì1782). The captain was killed March 8, 1782 within sight of Bush Fort in the vicinity of the Buckhannon River. But, historic documentation places Buckongahelas in Ohio by 1781, as he was moving his band west to escape European-American encroachment. American Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War, Buckongahelas led his followers against the Continentals. He broke away from the neutral and pro-American Lenape led by White Eyes. He took his band west to establish a town near the war chief Blue Jacket of the Shawnee. The two men became close allies.Sugden, John. Blue Jacket: Warrior of the Shawnees. University of Nebraska Press, 2000 During the war years, a number of Lenape who had converted to Christianity were living in frontier villages run by Moravian missionaries. In April 1781, at the Ohio village of Gnadenh√ºtten, Buckongahelas warned the Lenape that an American militia from Pennsylvania was likely to execute any Indians in their path and would not pay attention to whether they were Christians. He urged the Lenape to follow him further west away from the encroaching colonists. Moving westward \\"from the rising sun,\\" the people could live where the land was good and his warriors would protect them.Blaisdell, Bob. \\"Buckongahelas\\", in Great Speeches by Native Americans, Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 2000, pp. 27 ‚Äì 28 The Delaware did not heed his words. John Heckewelder, a Moravian missionary, wrote in his account that Buckongahelas' oration to the Christian Indians was told \\"with ease and an eloquence not to be imitated.\\" He continued, \\"Eleven months after this speech was delivered by this prophetic chief, ninety-six of these same Christian Indians, about sixty of them women and children, were murdered at the place where these very words had been spoken, by the same men he had alluded to, and in the same manner that he had described.\\" On March 8, 1782, state militia attacked and killed the Lenape in what is known as the Gnadenh√ºtten massacre. Post-war tensions After the Revolutionary War, the United States claimed the Ohio Country by right of conquest through its defeat of Great Britain. In the late 1780s, Buckongahelas joined a Shawnee-led confederacy to try to repel the American settlers who had begun migrating west of the Appalachian Mountains, using the Ohio River to penetrate the territory. They won several battles against the Americans in the Northwest Indian Wars. Buckongahelas led his warriors in helping to win the most devastating military victory ever achieved by Native Americans in the United States, in 1791 against General Arthur St. Clair, who lost 600 troops. The Delaware described Buckongahelas as their own George Washington. Standing 5 feet, 10 inches tall, he was strong with powerful muscles and was said to resemble the statesman Benjamin Franklin. The confederacy were finally defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The British failed to support the Indian confederacy after this battle, and Buckongahelas signed the Treaty of Greenville on August 3, 1795. By this treaty, his band and other Lenape ceded much land in Pennsylvania and Ohio to the United States.White, Richard. The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991 At times, competing tribes tried to control the lands and villages, and it was not clear that the chiefs who signed the treaties had authority over the lands they were ceding. On June 7, 1803, Buckongahelas signed the Treaty of Fort Wayne in Indiana; the US set new boundaries for the Lenape and other nations. They also ceded salt springs. Algonquian tribes ceded large land tracts to the United States. Lastly, he signed the Treaty of Vincennes on August 18, 1804, in Vincennes, Indiana. The Lenape ceded lands between the Ohio and Wabash rivers. The treaty helped open the Ohio and Indiana territories to European-American settlement. Not able to read and write, Buckongahelas made \\"X\\" signatures on the three treaties. Buckongahelas spent his final years living with his people on the White River near present-day Muncie, Indiana. He died in May 1805 at the age of 85 from smallpox or influenza. Many local Native Americans thought the epidemics of fatal illnesses to be related to witchcraft, as their traditional remedies and medicine men had no effect on the course of the diseases. They conducted a witch-hunt and executed several Lenape suspected of witchcraft. The conditions of defeat and despair were the grounds for the rise of the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa, who promised renewed power for the American Indians against the European Americans. His brother Tecumseh became an influential chief leading a new Indian confederacy against the Americans in the early 19th century. Legacy and honors * Chief Buckongahelas' loss of his son Mahonegon was memorialized in a 650-pound bronze statue installed in Buckhannon's Jawbone Run Park, because settlers admired his alliance with British colonists during the Seven Years' War. The statue depicts the chief cradling the body of his son. Popular culture references * The killing of the chief's son was represented in the historical romance novel The Scout of the Buckongehanon (1927), written by John Camillus McWhorter (1866‚Äì1937), a judge in Buckhannon.

During his career he played for the Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres. The left-handed Giles was a two-time All-Star and had a career line of .291/.400/.502 with 287 home runs, 411 doubles, 1,078 runs batted in (RBI), and 1,183 walks in 1,847 games. His younger brother, Marcus Giles, is a former Major League infielder who was most notable for playing with the Atlanta Braves organization. Professional career =Cleveland Indians= Giles was born in El Cajon, California, and attended Granite Hills High School. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 17th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. By 1994, Giles had worked his way up to Triple-A, where he batted .313 for Charlotte making the International League All-Star team. In 1995, Giles was again in Triple-A, where he batted .310 for Buffalo and made his major league debut as a September callup on September 16 (where he would bat .556 in nine at-bats with the Indians). He was also an American Association All-Star. Giles hit .355 in 51 games for the Indians in 1996 and hit .314 in 83 games with Buffalo, again making the American Association All-Star team. In 1997, Giles established himself as a major league regular, playing 130 games for the Indians and 112 games in 1998. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On November 18, 1998, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitcher Ricardo Rinc√≥n. In 1999 with the Pirates, Giles emerged as a power-hitting outfielder who also hit for average and showed plate discipline. He began a streak of hitting at least 35 home runs for four straight seasons, during which he batted no lower than .298 and was named Pittsburgh Pirates Player of the Year each year. Giles led the 2000 club in doubles, triples, home runs, RBIs and walks. His 123 RBIs were eight shy of Paul Waner's club record of 131 set in 1927. He became the first Pirate ever to hit at least .300 with 30 plus home runs and 100 plus RBIs in back-to-back seasons, he became the third player in club history with 100 runs, 100 RBIs and 100 walks in the same season, after Barry Bonds in 1992 and Ralph Kiner from 1948‚Äì51. His 114 walks were the most by a Pirate since 1992, Bonds drew 127 walks. Giles' 74 home runs in two seasons with the club represent the most in back-to-back seasons since Willie Stargell hit 77 in 1972‚Äì73. He was named National League Player-of-the-Week after hitting .400 with two doubles, three home runs and 12 RBIs between May 2 and May 7 and shared player of the week honors with Colorado's Todd Helton after hitting .523 with three doubles, one triple, three home runs, eight RBIs and six runs scored between August 12 and August 20. Giles was named to the All-Star team for the first time in his career. He finished ninth in voting among National League outfielders. In 2001 Giles established career highs in games played, at bats, runs and hits. He tied career highs in doubles, triples and stolen bases. At the end of the season he ranked tenth among N.L. players in runs, on-base percentage, .404, and slugging percentage, .590. His 116 runs scored were the most by a Pirate since Ralph Kiner in 1951. He led the Pirates in batting, home runs and walks. He tied Dave Parker's club record for most total bases, 340, by a left-handed hitter. Giles hit his 100th career home run as a member of the Pirates on August 9, he is one of 17 players to homer 100 times as a Pirate. He was selected to play in the All- Star Game for the second consecutive year. Giles ranked second in the league in walks behind San Francisco's Barry Bonds, who led with 198 in 2002. He also established the club record for most base on balls in a season by a left-handed batter. His .450 on-base percentage tied him for the second-best mark in the majors, he also ranked second in the league in slugging percentage with .622, sixth in home runs, second with 80 extra-base hits ranked second behind San Francisco's Jeff Kent, tied for second in the league with 13 outfield assists and also finished third in the N.L. with 24 intentional walks. He homered once every 13.1 at bats, the third- best ratio in the league behind Bonds' 8.8 and Sammy Sosa's 11.3. =San Diego Padres= Giles in 2007. On August 26, 2003, he was traded to his hometown San Diego Padres for Jason Bay, √ìliver P√©rez, and minor leaguer Corey Stewart. From 2004‚Äì2006, Giles played in over 150 games each season for the Padres, but in 2006, his batting average dropped to a career-low .263. On May 14, 2006, he drew five walks in a game, one shy of the record of six. In 2007, joined by his brother Marcus, signed as a free agent to be the starting second baseman, Giles batted .271, but missed time with an injured knee. In 2008, Giles, in the third and final guaranteed year of his contract with the Padres, vetoed a potential trade to Boston,\\"Brian Giles trade from San Diego to Boston falls through\\". August 8, 2008, Associated Press. Yahoo! News. Retrieved on August 10, 2008. citing a desire to remain close to his family\\"No deal: Giles remains with Padres\\". August 8, 2008, MLB.com. Retrieved on August 10, 2008. In 2008, 58% of his strikeouts were \\"looking\\", by far the highest percentage in the major leagues. In 2009, through July 1 Giles had the lowest batting average (.191), slugging percentage (.271), and OPS (.548) in the major leagues. However, he went on the disabled list soon afterward with an arthritic right knee and missed the rest of the season. As of August 22, 2018 the San Diego Padres have cut ties with Brian Giles and his brother Marcus, over domestic violence issues. http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/padres/sd-sp- padres-brian-marcus-giles-domestic-violence-0821-story.html =Retirement= On February 7, 2010, Giles signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and received an invitation to spring training. However, after playing in just two spring training games as a designated hitter, he announced his retirement on March 11, 2010.Dodgers outfielder Brian Giles retires Personal life Giles was sued by his former girlfriend for more than $10 million. She alleged Giles broke an oral and/or implied agreement that he would take care of her for an indefinite period of time. She alleged Giles began abusing her in 2002, and battered her while she was pregnant with Giles' child, and caused her to have a miscarriage. She dropped the allegations that Giles caused the miscarriage before the trial began. A jury found that both Giles and his girlfriend, Cheri Olvera, committed acts of domestic violence against each other but that there were no damages. The jury also refused to award damages on Olvera's contract claim, finding that Olvera's alleged terms were not clear enough so that both Olvera and Giles could understand what each was required to do. Instead, the jury found that Olvera must return the $107,000 engagement ring Giles provided to her or pay the $107,000 as damages. Following Giles' dispute with Olvera and given the nature of the court case, Giles' endorsement contract with Nair Hair Removal products was terminated.

Oxford University Press p. 635. The otoplastic surgeon corrects the defect or deformity by creating an external ear that is of natural proportions, contour, and appearance, usually achieved by the reshaping, the moving, and the augmenting of the cartilaginous support framework of the pinna. Moreover, the occurrence of congenital ear deformities occasionally overlaps with other medical conditions (e.g. Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia). History Otoplastic surgery was first practiced and established in Asia, by Sushruta, an Indian Ayurvedic physician. (ca. 800 BC) =Antiquity= Otoplasty (surgery of the ear) was developed in ancient India, in the 5th century BC, by the ayurvedic physician Sushruta (ca. 800 BC), which he described in the medical compendium, the Sushruta samhita (Sushruta's Compendium, ca. AD 500). In his time, the physician Sushruta and his medical students developed otoplastic and other plastic surgical techniques and procedures for correcting (repairing) and reconstructing ears, noses, lips, and genitalia that were amputated as criminal, religious, and military punishments. The ancient Indian medical knowledge and plastic surgery techniques of the Sushruta samhita were practiced throughout Asia until the late 18th century; the October 1794 issue of the contemporary British Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine reported the practice of rhinoplasty, as described in the 5th-century medical book, the Sushruta samhita. Moreover, two centuries later, contemporary otoplastic praxis, slightly modified, derives from the techniques and procedures developed and established in antiquity, by the Indian ayurvedic physician Sushruta. The German polymath Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach was a pioneer in the fields of plastic surgery. (ca. 1840) =Nineteenth Century= In Die operative Chirurgie (Operational Surgery, 1845), Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794‚Äì1847) reported the first surgical approach for the correction of prominent ears ‚Äî a combination otoplasty procedure that featured the simple excision (cutting) of the problematic excess cartilage from the posterior sulcus (back groove) of the ear, and the subsequent affixing, with sutures, of the corrected pinna to the mastoid periosteum, the membrane covering the mastoid process at the underside of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, at the back of the head. cited by =20th and 21st centuries= In 1920, Harold D. Gillies (1882‚Äì1960) first reproduced the pinna by burying an external-ear support framework, made of autologous rib cartilage, under the skin of the mastoid region of the head, which reconstructed pinna he then separated from the skin of the mastoid area by means of a cervical flap. In 1937, Dr. Gillies also attempted a like pediatric ear reconstruction with a pinna support framework fabricated with maternal cartilage. That otoplasty correction technique proved inadequate, because of the problems inherent to the biochemical breakdown and elimination (resorption) of the cartilage tissue by the patient's body. In 1964, Radford C. Tanzer (1921‚Äì2004) re-emphasized the use of autologous cartilage as the most advantageously reliable organic material for resolving microtia, abnormally small ears, because of its great histologic viability, resistance to shrinkage, and resistance to softening, and lower incidence of resorption. The development of plastic surgery procedures, such as the refinement of J.F. Dieffenbach's ear surgery techniques, has established more than 170 otoplasty procedures for correcting prominent ears, and for correcting the defects and deformities of the pinna; as such, otoplasty corrections are in three surgical-technique groups: Group I - Techniques that leave intact the cartilage support-framework of the ear, and reconfigure the distance and the angle of projection of the pinna from the head, solely by means of sutures, as in the permanent suture-insertion of the Mustard√© technique the Merck stitch method Merck, W.H.

The mattress sutures are inserted in the ear through 2 to 3 small stab incisions on the back of the ear. c) Incisionless Fritsch otoplasty: It is a combination of the minimally invasive technique and the Stenstr√∂m technique, whereby the cartilage on the front of the ear is scored with superficial incisions. Group II ‚Äî Techniques that resect (cut and remove) the pertinent excess cartilage from the support-framework of the pinna, which then render it pliable to being re-molded, reconfigured, and affixed to the head at the projection distance- and-angle characteristic of a normal ear; the relevant procedures are the cartilage-incision Converse technique and the Chongchet‚ÄìStenstr√∂m technique for the anterior-correction of prominent ears. Group III ‚Äî Techniques that combine the excision of cartilage portions from the support framework of the pinna, in order to reduce the degree of projection and the distance of the external ear from the head. Surgical anatomy of the external ear The pinna is an anatomic structure composed of a cartilage support framework covered with thin, hairless skin. Prominent ears: the bat-wing type, which extend outwards and to the front, can be corrected with an otopexy procedure. The pinna The external ear (pinna) is a surgically challenging anatomy composed of a delicate and complex framework of shaped cartilage that is covered, on its visible surface, with thin, tightly adherent, hairless skin. Although of small area, the surface anatomy of the external ear is complex, consisting of the pinna (the auricle) and the external auditory meatus (auditory canal). The outer framework of the pinna is composed of the rim of the helix, which arises from the front and from below (anteriorly and inferiorly), from a crus (shank) that extends horizontally above the auditory canal. The helix merges downwards (inferiorly) into the cauda helices (tail of the helix), and connects to the lobule (earlobe). The region located between the crura (shanks) of the antihelix is the triangular fossa (depression), while the scapha (elongated depression) lies between the helix and antihelix. The antihelix borders in the middle (medially) to the rim of the concha (shell) and the concha proper, which is composed of the conchal cymba above (superiorly) and the conchal cavum below (inferiorly), which are separated by the helical crus, and meet the antihelix at the antihelical rim. The tragus (auditory canal lobule) and the antitragus (counterpart lobule) are separated by the intertragal notch; the auditory canal lobule does not contain cartilage, and displays varied morphologic shapes and attachments to the adjacent cheek and scalp. Blood supply and innervation The superficial temporal and posterior auricular arteries preserve the arterial blood supply of the external ear. The sensory innervation involves the front and back (anterior and posterior) branches of the greater auricular nerve, and is reinforced by the auricular temporal and lesser occipital nerves. The auricular branch of the vagus nerves supplies a portion of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal. Otoplastic praxis The support framework of the reconstructed pinna must be more rigid than the natural cartilage framework of a normal ear, in order for it to remain of natural size, proportion, and contour. If the reconstructed pinna framework were as structurally delicate as the cartilage framework of a natural pinna, its anatomic verisimilitude as an ear would gradually be eroded by a combination of the pressure of the tight skin-envelope in the temporal region of the head, and of the pressure of the progressive contracture of the surgical scar(s). Prominent ears In the practice of otoplasty, the term prominent ears describes external ears (pinnae) that, regardless of their size, protrude from the sides of the head. The abnormal appearance exceeds the normal head-to-ear measures, wherein the external ear is less than 2.0 cm, and at an angle of less than 25 degrees, from the side of the head. Ear configurations, of distance and angle, that exceed the normal measures, appear prominent when the man or the woman is viewed from either the front or the back perspective. In the occurrence of prominent ears, the common causes of anatomic defect, deformity, and abnormality can occur individually or in combination; they are: (i) Underdeveloped antihelical fold This anatomic deformity occurs consequent to the inadequate folding of the antihelix, which causes the protrusion of the scapha and the helical rim. The defect is manifested by the prominence of the scapha (the elongated depression separating the helix and the antihelix) and the upper-third of the ear; and occasionally of the middle third of the ear. (ii) Prominent concha This deformity is caused either by an excessively deep concha, or by an excessively wide concha-mastoid angle (<25 degrees). These two anatomic abnormalities can occur in combination, and produce a prominent concha (the largest, deepest concavity of the pinna), which then causes the prominence of the middle third of the external ear. (iii) Protruding earlobe This defect of the earlobe causes the prominence of the lower third of the pinna. Although most prominent ears are anatomically normal, morphologic defects, defromities, and abnormalities do occur, such as the: * Constricted ear which features an abnormally small pinna, and protrudes from the head because of the inadequate development of the circumference of the helical rim, which, in turn, causes the pinna to collapse forwards, and form a cup ear. * Cryptotic ear which is hidden in the side of the head. The condition of a hidden ear is produced when the developed helix of the pinna is contained under the skin of the scalp in the temporal region. (see Cryptotia) * Macrotic ear, a prominent external ear that features an oversized pinna, but is otherwise morphologically normal. (see Macrotia) * Question mark ear describes the ear that features a deformity of the supralobular region (upper area of the pinna), and has the appearance of a question mark (?). * Stahl's ear deformity describes the presence of a third crus (shank) in the pinna, which produces a pointed elfin ear. The third crus is additional to the two crura (shanks) of the normal triangular fossa (depression), which traverses the scapha (elongated depression separating the helix and the antihelix). =The angles of the ear= Cephaloauricular and scaphoconchal angles The degrees of angle between the head and the ear, and the degrees of angle between the scapha and the concha, determine the concept of prominent ears. The study, Comparing Cephaloauricular and Scaphaconchal Angles in Prominent Ear Patients and Control Subjects (2008) reported that the comparisons of the head-to-ear angles and the scapaha-to- concha angles of a 15-patient cohort with prominent ears, with the analogous ear angles of a 15-person control group, established that the average head-to- ear angle was 47.7 degrees for the study group, and 31.1 degrees for the control group; and that the average scapha-to-concha angle was 132.6 degrees for the study cohort, and 106.7 degrees for the control group. The angles of the ear determine the surgical anatomy of the pinna, as considered for otoplasty correction. Antihelix The antihelix normally forms a symmetric Y-shaped structure in which the gently rolled (folded) crest of the root of the antihelix continues upwards as the superior crus, and the inferior crus branches forwards, from the root, as a folded ridge. The root of the inferior crus of the antihelix sharply defines the rim of the concha. Moreover, the inferior crus also forms the wall that separates the concha from the triangular fossa. The root and superior crus of the antihelix form the anterior wall of the scaphoid fossa, and the helix forms the posterior wall. The triangular fossa dips within the Y-arms of the superior and inferior crura. The corrugated contours of these auricular crests and valleys provide a pillar effect (support) that stabilizes the pinna. The vertical walls of the conchal cup translate to a semi-horizontal plane as the concha merges with the folded crest of the antihelix. The scapha‚Äìhelix is nearly parallel to the plane of the temporal surface of the head. If the roll of the antihelix and its crest are effaced and flat, rather than rolled or folded, the steep pitch of the conchal wall continues into the un-formed antihelix and scapha and ends at the helix, with little interruption. Said planar orientation places the scapha‚Äìhelix complex nearly perpendicular to the temporal plane of the head ‚Äî because of which the ear appears prominent, thus, such an ear also lacks the stability provided by the pillar effect, and so allows the superior auricular pole to protrude. In the literature, effacement (deficiency) of the antihelical fold is the foremost subject of most discussions of the prominent ear, because it is an aurical deformity manifested as a spectrum of defects and deformities ‚Äî ranging from an indistinguishable antihelix (with a confluent concavity, from antihelix to scapha and the helical rim projected outwards and forwards) to loss of definition solely of the superior antihelix (with prominence of the upper pole of the ear). Concha The concha of the ear is an irregular hemispheric bowl with a defined rim. The normal scapha‚Äìhelix surrounds the posterior part of the bowl (much as the brim of an inverted hat surrounds the crown). The pitch at which the scapha‚Äìhelix projects from the conchal cup is determined: (i) by the acuteness of the fold of the crest of the antihelix, (ii) by the height of the posterior wall of the conchal bowl, and (iii) by the completeness of the hemisphere formed by the concha. If the posterior wall of the concha is excessively high, and the concha is excessively spherical, then there is an excessive angle and distance between the plane of the scapha‚Äìhelix and the plane of the temporal surface of the head. Such protrusion usually is evenly distributed around the posterior conchal wall, however, the cephalad part of the concha can protrude disproportionately, another cause for a protruding upper pole. Similarly, the caudal part of the concha can project disproportionately, and cause a protruding lower auricular pole, therefore, these deformational features require special attention in the operating room. Moreover, regarding the shape and projection of the ear, the importance of the concha must be considered in relation to the three-tiered configuration of the auricular cartilage framework, because the more delicate antihelix and helical complex are mounted upon the sturdier concha; therefore, changes in conchal size and shape greatly influence the overlying tiers, hence it is rare to see prominence of the ear that does not have a conchal element. The concha affects the prominence of the ear three-fold ways: (i) the overall enlargement of the concha projects the ear away from the mastoid surface; (ii) an extension of the helical crus across the concha creates a firm cartilage bar that pushes the ear outwards; (iii) the effect of the angulation of the cartilage, at the junction between the cavum concha; and the sweep of cartilage up to the antitragal prominence, affects the position and prominence of the lobule (earlobe) and lower third of the ear. Understanding the first deformational element is well recognized, and, despite limited attention to the second element, once seen, it is easily understood. Therefore, understanding the third element leads to understanding the surgical-technical approach to correcting the isolated lower-pole and lobule prominence. The latter feature of conchal shape, while not the sole cause of lobular prominence, appears to play a key role. As the cartilage angle, between the concha cavum and the antitragus, becomes more acute (i.e. as the antitragus tips closer towards the concha), this supporting structure outwardly projects the lobule and the lower-third of the ear. This feature has a greater influence upon the lobule position than does the commonly described helical tail. Protruding antihelix and protruding concha combined The combined effects of an effaced antihelix and a deep concha also contribute to severe auricular protrusion, that is, a very prominent ear. Protruding mastoid process  Auricular prominence: in the occipital area, behind the pinna, a protruding mastoid process is a proximate cause of bat ears. The soft tissues of the ear: the anatomic location of the posterior muscle of the ear (auricularis posterior) in relation to the pinna. Otoplasty: The cranial surface cartilage of the right ear; the ponticulus (ctr rt.) and the cauda helicis (right) also can be proximate causes of prominent ears. The soft tissues of the right ear: the three muscles that serve the pinna (external ear) the auricularis posterior (left), the auricularis superior (above), and the auricularis anterior (right) as considered for otoplasty correction. Auricular prominence The occurrence of a prominent mastoid process tends to push the concha forward, which extends the pinna (external ear) away from the side of the head. The external ear is mounted upon the bony base of the underlying temporal bone, therefore, anomalies and asymmetries of the skeletal shape can cause either pinna, or both pinnae, to become prominent. In relation to the protruding mastoid process, the most recognizable skeletal anomaly is the change in the position and in the projection of the pinna, as associated with non-synostotic plagiocephaly (the positional flattening of the side of the head, not caused by the inappropriate union of two bones). Hence, in the occurrence of a flattening of the skull (parallelogram deformation of the cranial vault), the side of the head afflicted with occipital plagiocephaly presents a prominent ear. In subtle cases, the prominent ear might be more readily evident in an elder patient, whose ears are asymmetrically positioned, reason for which the residual occipital flattening (occipital plagiocephay), and mild facial asymmetry, are unapparent at first view. This effect, of the shape of the patient's head, upon the outward and extended position of the ear is notably indicated in the 19th-century illustrations that describe the Ely otoplasty technique (1881). Hemifacial microsomia The undersized development of one side of a person's face, demonstrates the influence of skeletal development upon the position of the external ear on the head, as caused by the deficient morphologic development of the temporal bone, and by the medial positioning of the temporomandibular joint, the synovial joint between the temporal bone and the mandible (upper jaw). Moreover, in severe cases of hemifacial microsomia, without the occurrence of microtia (small ears), the normal external ear might appear to have been sheared off the head, because the upper half of the pinna is projecting outwards, and, at the middle point, the lower half of the pinna is canted inwards, towards the hypoplastic, underdeveloped side of the face of the patient. A similar type of asymmetric development of the head and face features a relatively broad head, a narrow face, and a narrow mandible; when observed from the front perspective, the head and face of the person present a triangular configuration. Such wide-to-narrow skeletal sloping, from the head to the face, might create the bone promontory upon which rests and from which projects the upper anatomy of the pinna, which otherwise is an external ear of normal proportions, size, and contour. Protruding cauda helicis The cauda helicis (tail of the helix) is bound to the fibrofatty tissues of the earlobe by a network of connective tissue. The tail of the helix (cauda helicis), which projects outwards from the concha, carries the earlobe with it, causing it to protrude, which physical condition contributes to prominence of the lower pole of the pinna, the external ear. Protruding earlobe Given the morphological diversity of the earlobes found among men, women, and children, some earlobes are large, some earlobes are pendulous, and some earlobes are large and pendulous, but some are prominent because of the structure and form of the dense, interlacing connective tissue fibers that shape the earlobe anatomy independent of the tail of the helix (cauda helicis). Soft tissues Functionally, the external ear is served by three (3) ear muscles, the auricularis posterior muscle (rear ear-muscle), the auricularis superior muscle (upper ear-muscle), and the auricularis anterior muscle (front ear-muscle), the most notable of which is the auricularis posterior muscle, which functions to pull the ear backwards, because it is superficially attached to the ponticulus (bridge) of the conchal cartilage, and to the posterior auricular ligament (rear ligament of the ear). The posterior muscle of the ear is composed of 2‚Äì3 fascicles (skeletal-muscle fibers contained in perimysium connective tissue), originates from the mastoid process of the temporal bone and is inserted to the lower part of the cranial surface of the concha, where it is surrounded by fibroareolar tissue deep within the temporal fascia. The posterior auricular artery irrigates the ear tissues with small, branch-artery blood vessels (rami). Likewise, the rear muscle of the ear is innervated with fine rami of the posterior auricular nerve, which is a branch of the facial nerve. Deep within these muscle and ligament structures lie the mastoid fascia and the tendinous origin of the sternomastoid muscle.  Surgical otoplasty  The corrective goal of otoplasty is to set back the ears so that they appear naturally proportionate and contoured without evidence or indication of surgical correction. Therefore, when the corrected ears are viewed, they should appear normal, from the: (i) Front perspective. When the ear (pinna) is viewed from the front, the helical rim should be visible, but not set back so far (flattened) that it is hidden behind the antihelical fold. (ii) Rear perspective. When the pinna is viewed from behind, the helical rim is straight, not bent, as if a \\"letter-C\\" (the middle-third to flat), or crooked, as if a hockey stick\\" (the earlobe is insufficiently flat). If the helical rim is straight, the setback is harmonious; that is, the upper-, middle-, and lower-thirds of the pinna will be proportionately setback in relation to each other. (iii) Side perspective. The contours of the ear should be soft and natural, not sharp and artificial. The severity of the ear deformity that's to be corrected determines the advantageous timing of an otoplasty, for example, in children with extremely prominent ears, 4-years old is a reasonable age. In cases of Macrotia associated with prominent ears, the child's age might be 2-years, nonetheless, it is advantageous to restrict the further growth of the deformed ear. Moreover, regardless of the patient's age, the otoplasty procedure requires that the patient be under general anaesthesia. Ear reconstruction. Generally, for reconstructing an entire ear, or a portion of the rim cartilage, the surgeon first harvests a costal cartilage graft from the patient's rib cage, which then is sculpted into an auricular framework that is emplaced under the temporal skin of the patient's head, so that the skin envelope encompass the cartilage framework, the ear prosthesis. Once emplaced and anchored with sutures, the surgeon then creates a pinna (outer ear) of natural proportions, contour, and appearance. In the next months, in follow-up surgeries, the surgeon then creates an earlobe, and also separates the reconstructed pinna from the side of the head (ca. 15‚Äì18 mm), in order to create a tragus, the small, rounded projection located before the external entrance to the ear canal. In the case of the patient encumbered with several congenital defects of the ear or who has insufficient autologous cartilage to harvest, it might be infeasible to effect the corrections with grafts of rib cartilage. In such a case, the reconstructive Antia‚ÄìBuch helical advancement technique might apply; it moves tissues from behind the ear rim, and then around and forward to repair the defective front of the ear rim. To perform the Antia‚ÄìBuch helical advancement, with ink, the surgeon first designs the incision inside the helical rim and around the crus (shank) of the helix. Then cuts the skin and the cartilage ‚Äî but does not pierce the posterior skin of the ear. The helical rim then is advanced to allow the suturing (closure), and a dog-ear- shaped graft of skin is removed from the back of the ear. The closure of the sutures advances the crus of the helix into the helical rim. = Indications = The ear defect or deformity to be corrected determines the otoplasty techniques and procedures to be applied, thus, a torn earlobe can be repaired solely with sutures; a slight damage to the rim of the pinna (outer ear) might be repaired with an autologous skin graft harvested from the scalp, yet conversely, a proper ear reconstruction might require several surgeries. In the correction of infantile ear defects and deformities, the otoplasty usually is performed when he or she is about six years old, because, at that age, the healthy ear is almost adult-sized, and thus can serve the plastic surgeon as a corrective template for the auricular reconstruction. Ear showing Darwin's tubercle: An evolutionary human-ear vestige in a woman; and the like morphologic feature in a macaque monkey. Microtia: Grade III microtia affecting the left ear of a boy. The otoplastic technique(s) applied to correct, reconstruct, or replace a deformed, defective, or a missing ear, is determined by the indications that the patient presents; some are: * Cagot ear ‚Äî A congenital defect characterized by ears without an earlobe; the name of the defect derives from the Cagot minority of northern Spain and western France, among whom this ear defect is genetically common. * Cat's ear ‚Äî A defect characterized by the outer edges of the ears folded forward, away from the sides of the head, and towards the face; hence the person's feline appearance. The plastic correction anchors, and thus flattens, the ear against the head. * Cauliflower ear ‚Äî An ear deformed by repeated trauma (injury) to the tissues as occurs to boxers and wrestlers; the name of deformity derives from its resemblance to a cauliflower. A hematoma might also result from an acute trauma, and, unless evacuated, the blood in the ear tends to become cartilaginous, resulting in a \\"cauliflower ear\\", which, once fully developed, is very difficult to correct. The successful management of a hematoma might require either repeated aspirations or an incision to fully evacuate the accumulated blood. After evacuation of the blood, the management of an acute othematoma of the concha features through-and-through bolster sutures to compress the skin against the cartilage, which usually prevents recurrence. * Cleft earlobe ‚Äî A defect characterized by an indentation (notch) to the fleshy portion of the earlobe. The usual correction is transplantation of an autologous tissue graft. * Constricted ear ‚Äî In mild cases of constricted ear, the crus (shank) of the helix is advanced out of the concha, and into the helical rim in order to increase its circumference. In severe cases of constricted ear, some of the cartilage is discarded and a complete reconstruction of the pinna is performed, as in the procedure for correcting microtia. * Cryptotia ‚Äî The hidden ear features the rim of the helix cartilage buried under the skin of the scalp in the temporal region. After making an incision, the upper portion of the ear is exposed by outward traction on the pinna, after making an incision around the visible helical rim. Then, the medial surface of the freed helical-rim cartilage is resurfaced either with a skin graft or with a skin flap. In most cases of Cryptotia, the upper-ear cartilage that is buried under the scalp is developmentally normal, but occasionally, it is abnormal and might also require correction. * Darwinian ear ‚Äî A defect wherein the rim cartilage of the conchal bowl of the ear is flat, rather than folded inwards; it is an evolutionary remnant from when the human head muscles permitted the person to voluntarily prick up the ears in a given direction. The Darwinian ear eponym derives from Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882), the British biologist and evolutionary theoretician. (see Darwin's tubercle) * Lop ear ‚Äî A protruding ear characterized by the defects of a too-small helix (the cartilage-stiffened rim of the pinna) and a large, central depression around the auricular canal (ear opening); the combined effects of the deformations produce a \\"cup ear\\" appearance. The usual plastic correction is enlargement of the helix and closer anchoring to the head. * Macrotia ‚Äî Ears that are proportionately oversized to the person's head; the surgeon reduces them by making an incision on the lateral surface of the pinna, just inside the helical rim. The scapha (elongated hollow) is reduced, and a segment of the helical rim is excised, and the incision is closed primarily to avoid redundancy. * Microtia ‚Äî A congenital defect characterized by either the severe underdevelopment or the absence of the pinna (outer ear). At one end of the spectrum is a pinna slightly smaller than normal, but of normal appearance, and at the other end of the spectrum is anotia, the absence of the pinna. The Nagata classification correlates the ear deformity with the surgical approach thus: (i) Lobule type ‚Äî The patient has an ear remnant and malpositioned lobule, but no concha, acoustic meatus, or tragus. (ii) Concha type ‚Äî The patients presents an ear remnant, malpositioned earlobe, concha (with or without acoustic meatus), tragus, and antitragus with an incisura intertragica. (iii) Small concha type ‚Äî The patient presents an ear remnant, malpositioned lobule, and a small indentation instead of a concha. (iv) Anotia ‚Äî The patient presents either no ear remnant, or a minute, ear remnant. (v) Atypical microtia ‚Äî The patient presents deformities of the ear that are not comprehended in the four preceding Nagata classifications. * Question mark ear ‚Äî A rare congenital defect characterized by a protuberant pinna (external ear) with a cleft (indentation) between the earlobe and the outer cartilage rim, between the fifth and sixth hillocks. This deformity also is known as Cosman ear, after Dr. Bard Cosman (1931‚Äì1983), the American plastic surgeon who identified it. The degree of anatomical deficiency is variable, and usually can be corrected with a cartilage graft and a V-Y advancement-flap of retroauricular skin, harvested from the back of the ear, because there often is excess skin in the upper-third of the ear being corrected. To reconstruct a Question mark ear featuring a severely deformed pinna, the otoplastic procedure for correcting microtia is applied. * Scroll ear ‚Äî A congenital defect characterized by the outer edge of the ear curling forward, inwards (like a curled scroll), and towards the head. * Skin cancer and malignant melanoma ‚Äî Cutaneous malignancies of the helical rim can be excised and closed with the Antia‚ÄìBuch helical advancement technique. Cancerous lesions in the concha or over the antihelix can usually be excised and skin grafted. If the cartilage is involved, it can be excised and the graft placed directly on the posterior skin. Malignant melanomas should be excised with the same margins as melanomas of the equivalent depth in other parts of the body. Melanoma in situ does not require a full-thickness excision, and is excised with a 5-mm margin, to preserve the perichondrium, and then covered with a skin graft. Invasive melanomas of the helical rim require wedge resection to achieve adequate margins; these defects might be large and require secondary reconstruction as in Figure 30.11. * Stahl's ear deformity ‚Äî A pointed-ear defect characterized by an abnormal folding of the skin and cartilage of the pinna, which produce an \\"elfin ear\\" characterized by an ear-rim with a pointed upper-edge, rather than a rounded upper-edge. * Wildermuth's ear ‚Äî A congenital defect characterized by a backwards-oriented helix (the pinna's curved, cartilage border), which deforms the ear by protruding the ante-helix (inner ridge of the pinna). The eponym derives from Hermann A. Wildermuth (1852‚Äì1907), the German neurologist who identified the defect. = Surgical procedures = Otoplastic surgery can be performed upon a patient under anesthesia ‚Äî local anesthesia, local anesthesia with sedation, or general anesthesia (usual for children). In order to correct a lop ear with a small helix (the cartilage- supported outer rim of the pinna), an incision to one side of a flat cartilage piece leaves unopposed elastic forces on the opposite side, which permits the evolution of the ear contour; thus, a small incision on one side of the lop- ear cartilage, along the new anti-helical fold, can be a technical element of the corrective ear surgery. Yet, when done without an incision, the procedure is deemed an incisionless otoplasty, wherein the surgeon places a needle through the skin, to model the cartilage and to emplace the retention sutures that will affix the antihelix and conchal bowl areas. Surgical otoplasty techniques Depending upon the auricular (pinna) defect, deformity, or reconstruction required, the surgeon applies these three otoplastic techniques, either individually or in combination to achieve an outcome that produces an ear of natural proportions, contour, and appearance: I. Antihelical Fold Manipulation a) Suturing of the cartilage. The surgeon emplaces mattress sutures on the back of the ears, which are tied with sufficient tension to increase the definition of the antihelical fold, thereby setting back the helical rim. The cartilage is not treated. This is the technique of Mustard√© and Merck. But there are differences between both methods. Whereas the Mustard√© method is an open invasive method, by which the cartilage on the back of the ears is extensively exposed and an area of skin is excised, the Merck method is a closed minimally invasive procedure, by which the cartilage is not exposed anywhere and skin is also not removed. b) Stenstr√∂m technique of anterior abrasion. The abrasion (roughening or scoring) of the anterior (front) surface of the anti helical fold cartilage causes the cartilage to bend away from the abraded side (per the Gibson principle), towards the side of intact perichondrium, the membrane of fibrous connective tissue. c) Full-thickness incisions. One full-thickness incision along the desired curvature of the antihelix permits folding it with slight force, thereby creating an antihelical fold (as in the Luckett procedure). Yet, because such a fold is sharp and unnatural in appearance, the technique was modified as the Converse‚ÄìWood-Smith technique, wherein two incisions are made, running parallel to the desired antihelical fold, and tubing sutures are emplaced to create a more defined fold of natural contour and appearance. II. Conchal Alteration (a) Suturing. The surgeon decreases the angle (-25 degrees) between the concha and the mastoid process of the head with sutures emplaced between the concha and the mastoid fascia Furnas, D. (1968). \\"Correction of prominent ears by concha mastoid sutures.\\" Plast Reconstr Surg 42:189 (b) Conchal excision. From either an anterior or a posterior approach, the surgeon removes a full-thickness crescent of cartilage from the posterior wall of the concha (ascertaining to neither violate nor deform the antihelical fold), to thereby reduce the height of the concha. Moreover, to avoid producing a noticeable surgical scar in the concha, the surgeon meticulously closes the conchal defect with sutures. The design of the cartilage-crescent excision means to produce a closing incision will lay at the junction of the conchal floor and the posterior conchal wall ‚Äî where it is least noticeable, and causes minimal distortion of the normal contours of the ear. (b) Combination of suturing and conchal excision. The surgeon applies a corrective technique that combines the pertinent technical aspects of the Furnas suture technique and of the conchal excision techniques. d) Medialisation of the conchal part of the Antihelix. With this method, the antihelix is moved in the direction of the ear canal entrance with the fingers and fixed in this position by mattress sutures. Thus, a big cavum conchae is reduced without any excision of cartilage and the ear moves towards the head to the desired degree. III. Correction of Earlobe Prominence Repositioning the earlobe is the most difficult part of the otoplasty, because when a pinna (external ear) that has been repositioned in its upper two-thirds, and that yet retains a prominent lobule (earlobe) will appear disproportionate to and malpositioned upon the head ‚Äî as it did in the original, uncorrected deformity. The otoplastic technique most effective for lobular repositioning is the Gosain technique (or a variant), wherein the surgeon cuts the skin on the medial surface of the earlobe, and, in suturing it closed, takes a bite of the conchal undersurface to pull the earlobe towards the head. Another prominent-earlobe correction technique is suturing the helical-cartilage tail to the concha, yet, because the tail of the helix does not extend much into the lobule, setting it back does not reliably correct the set back of the earlobe proper; other techniques involve skin excision and sutures, between the fibrofatty tissue of the lobule and the tissues of the neck. IV. Alteration of the position of the auricular upper pole Depending upon the pre-surgical degree of prominence of the upper- third of the pinna, the surgical creation of the antihelical fold might be inadequate to fully correct the position of the helical rim, near the root of the helix. Types of otoplastic correction * Ear augmentation, addressing Microtia (underdeveloped pinna) and Anotia (absent pinna) involves adding structural elements to replace the missing structures. The cartilage tissue grafts for such extensive reconstructions usually are harvested either from the ear (auricular cartilage) or from the rib cage (costal cartilage). * Ear pinback ‚Äî An otopexy that \\"flattens\\" protuberant ears against the head (ca. 15‚Äì18 mm), wherein the surgeon makes an incision to the natural crease behind (retroauricular sulcus) the external ear, and cuts a small tunnel along the front of the poorly folded antihelix. Once the cartilage is loosened, the concha (bowl) is moved closer to the head, after removing the excess skin and cartilage from the ear rim, and is sutured to reshape the antihelical fold, to balance the ear lobe (lobule) with the proportions of the pinna. The corrected ear then is emplaced and sutured closer to the head. Surgical ear pinback can be performed upon an anesthetized patient (local or general anesthesia), and usually is performed as an outpatient procedure that allows the patient to convalesce at home. The post-operative bruising and swelling usually subside within two weeks, and the narrow, surgical scars are hidden in the posterior skin folds of the ear; yet the outcome is not fully noticeable until the swelling and bruising have gone. Historically, otopexy dates from 1881, when Edward Talbott Ely first performed ear pinback plastic surgery at the Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital, Manhattan, New York City. * Ear reduction, addressing Macrotia, might involve reducing one or more of the components of oversized ears; the incisions usually are hidden in, or near, the front folds of the pinna. Post-surgical recovery The internal sutures usually are permanent (non-absorbable), but the surgical wound or wounds can be sutured with either absorbable sutures or with non-absorbable sutures that the plastic surgeon removes when the surgical wound has healed. Depending upon the deformity to be corrected, the otoplasty can be performed either as an outpatient surgery or at hospital; while the operating room (OR) time varies between 1.5 and 5.0 hours. For several days after the surgery, the otoplasty patient wears a voluminous, non-compressive dressing upon the corrected ear(s), during which convalescent period, he or she must avoid excessive bandage pressure upon the ear, lest it cause pain and increase swelling, which might lead to the abrasion (rubbing), or even to the necrosis of the ear's skin. After removing the dressing, the patient then wears a loose headband whilst sleeping, for a 3‚Äì6-week period; it should be snug, not tight, because its purpose is preventing the corrected ear(s) from being pulled forward, when the sleeping patient moves whilst asleep. Hence, a tight headband can abrade and erode the side surface of the ear, possibly creating an open wound. Dressing does not have to be worn if one was operated with the stitch method. Complications * Hematoma. This otoplasty complication is immediately addressed when the patient complains of excessive pain, or when the surgical wound bleeds. The dressing is immediately removed from the ear to ascertain the existence of a hematoma, which then is immediately evacuated. If the surgical wound is infected, antibiotic therapy helps avoid the occurrence either of abscess or of perichondritis (inflammation). * Infection. Cellulitis is rare after otoplasty, but it is treated aggressively, with antibiotics in order to avoid chondritis ‚Äî which might require debridement, and permanently disfigure the ear. * Suture complications. The most common otoplastic complication is suture extrusion in the retroauricular sulcus, (the groove behind the ear). Such extruded sutures are easy to remove, but the extrusion occurrence might be associated with granulomas, which are painful and unattractive. This complication might be avoided by using absorbable sutures; to which effect, monofilament sutures are likelier to protrude, but have a lesser incidence rate of granulomas; whereas braided sutures are unlikely to protrude, but have a greater incidence rate of granulomas. * Overcorrection and unnatural contour. The most common, but significant, complication of otoplasty is overcorrection, which can be minimized by the surgeon's detailed attention to the functional principles of the surgical technique employed. Hence, function over form shall minimize the creation of the unnatural contours characteristic of the \\"technically perfect ear\\".  Non-surgical otoplasty  =Indications= Incidence of ear deformity Approximately 20‚Äì30 per cent of newborn children are born with deformities of the external ear (pinna) that can occur either in utero (congenitally) or in the birth canal (acquired). The possible defects and deformities include protuberant ears (\\"bat ears\\"); pointed ears (\\"elfin ears\\"); helical rim deformity, wherein the superior portion of the ear lacks curvature; cauliflower ear, which appears as if crushed; lop ear, wherein the upper portion of the pinna is folded onto itself; and others. Such deformities usually are self-correcting, but, if at 1-week of age, the child's external ear deformity has not self-corrected, then either surgical correction (otoplasty ca. 5‚Äì6 years of age) or non-surgical correction (tissue molding) is required to achieve an ear of normal proportions, contour, and appearance. Non-surgical otoplasty: The therapeutic aspects, before (left), during (center), and after (right), of a tissue- molding procedure performed with an EarWell device. =Tissue Molding= (i) Taping, (ii) physician-designed splints, (iii) EarWell, (iv) Ear Buddies and (v) earFold In the early weeks of infancy, the cartilage of the infantile pinna is unusually malleable, because of the remaining maternal estrogens circulating in the organism of the child. During that biochemically privileged period, prominent ears, and related deformities, can be permanently corrected by molding the pinnae (ears) to the correct shape, either by the traditional method of taping, with tape and soft dental compound (e.g. gutta-percha latex), or solely with tape; or with non-surgical tissue-molding appliances, such as custom-made, defect-specific splints designed by the physician; and the EarWell and the Ear Buddies devices, which are technical variants of the splint-and-tape method of mechanical ear-defect correction; each method requires fastening to the infant's head with adhesive tape. Therapeutically, the splint-and-adhesive-tape treatment regimen is months-long, and continues until achieving the desired outcome, or until there is no further improvement in the contour of the pinna, likewise, with the custom and commercial tissue- molding devices. Adults At, or above, the age of 7, a child or adult could treat their prominent ears with a minimally invasive technique using earFold implants to remold the cartilage in their ears in a simple procedure which can be performed under local anaesthesia. =Taping= The traditional, non-surgical correction of protuberant ears is taping them to the head of the child, in order to \\"flatten\\" them into the normal configuration. The physician effects this immediate correction to take advantage of the maternal estrogen-induced malleability of the infantile ear cartilages during the first 6 weeks of his or her life. The taping approach can involve either adhesive tape and a splinting material, or only adhesive tape; the specific deformity determines the correction method. This non-surgical correction period is limited, because the extant maternal estrogens in the child's organism diminish within 6‚Äì8 weeks; afterwards, the ear cartilages stiffen, thus, taping the ears is effective only for correcting \\"bat ears\\" (prominent ears), and not the serious deformities that require surgical re-molding of the pinna (external ear) to produce an ear of normal size, contour, and proportions. Furthermore, ear correction by splints and tape requires the regular replacement of the splints and the tape, and especial attention to the child's head for any type of skin erosion, because of the cumulative effects of the mechanical pressures of the splints proper and the adhesive of the fastener tape. =Physician-designed splints= Congenital ear deformities are defined as either malformations (microtia, cryptotia) or deformations, wherein the term \\"ear deformation\\" implies a normal chondrocutaneous component with an abnormal auricular architecture. The conditions are categorized as constricted ears, Stahl's ear deformity, and prominent ears, which derive from varied causes, such as the abnormal development and functioning of the intrinsic and extrinsic ear muscles, which might generate forces that deform the auricle (pinna); and external forces consequent to malpositioning of the head during the prenatal and neonatal periods of the child's life. The study, Postpartum Splinting of Ear Deformities (2005), reported the efficacy of splinting the ears of a child during the early neonatal period as a safe and effective non-surgical treatment for correcting congenital ear deformities. The splint applied was a wire-core segment, in a 6-French silastic tube, that was affixed with adhesive skin-closure strips; the device was applied 3‚Äì4 weeks without anaesthesia; three (3) cases demonstrated the efficacy of non- surgical correction by means of splinting for the re-shaping of deformed infantile ears: * Case 1: constricted ear ‚Äî Despite no family history of this congenital defect, a full-term male child presented bilateral constricted ears characterized by a constricted rim with the appearance of a string-closed purse. The splint-correction treatment began at 3-days post-partum, for a 1-month treatment regimen. At 10-days, the upper pole of the auricle (ear) had expanded; at the 6-month follow-up examination, the ear correction remained expanded. * Case 2: Stahl's ear ‚Äî A full-term male child presented Stahl's ear deformity characterized by a helical rim with a third crus (shank), a flat helix, and a malformed scaphoid fossa. The correction was initiated at 3-days post-partum, for a 3-week treatment regimen; at 10-days the correction was apparent with the disappearance of the third crus (shank), and the formation of a normal helical rim; the correction remained effective at 6-months post- procedure. * Case 3: prominent ears ‚Äî A full-term female child presented bilateral prominent ears characterized by excessive height of the conchal wall, and an over-wide conchoscaphal angle (>90 degrees). The correction was initiated at 3-days postpartum, for a 4-week treatment regimen, wherein the splinting reduced the initially over-wide conchascaphal angle (>90 degrees) to a closer, more natural position (<90 degrees). The ear deformities corrected with physician-designed and -fabricated splints were confected with materials such as # Wire core segment in 6-French silastic tubing ‚Äî The shaped splint was emplaced in the groove between the helix and the antihelix, and affixed with 3‚Äì5 strips of adhesive skin-closure tape. # Self-adhering foam ‚Äî Meant to prevent the splints from damaging the infantile skin; the foam is applied at the bottom of the auricular fold, and in the conchal fossa proper. # Temporary stopping ‚Äî A dental material (e.g. gutta-percha latex) was applied to press upon and correct the abnormal folding of the anterolateral surface and of the posteromedial surface; it was affixed with strips of adhesive skin-closure tape. # Dental waxes ‚Äî Bite-impression and dental-impression compounds prepared with heat and water, and then molded to the desired auricular contour; it was affixed with strips of adhesive skin-closure tape. # Thermoplastic materials ‚Äî Malleable compounds that are hard and elastic at room temperature, but that soften at a temperature of less than 60 ¬∞C (140 ¬∞F), were applied to the ear to exert light pressure from the anterior side and the posterior side of the pinna, after which it hardens in minutes. # Commercial ear-splint devices ‚Äî proportionately scaled tapes and splints for ear-correction application to a newborn child, e.g. the EarWell and Ear Buddies devices. =EarWell infant ear correction system= The mechanical-molding correction of infantile ear deformity, made possible by the estrogen-induced malleability of the cartilages of the pinna (ear), permits the application of the EarWell device to re-form the infant's deformed ear into an ear of normal proportions, contour, and appearance. Among the deformities that can be non-surgically corrected with the EarWell device are prominent ears (\\"bat ears\\"), Stahl's ear deformity (\\"elfin ears\\"), lop ear with a small helix (outer cartilage rim), lidding of the upper portion of the auricle (helix), helical compression, conchal crus, cryptotia, characterized by an ear, the top of which is hidden in the skin of the scalp, and the less severe Tanzer II constricted ear malformations.Correction of Childhood Ear Deformity at Birth with EarWell (2011) Plastic and Craniofacial Surgery for Infants and Children. The EarWell infant ear correction system is a tissue- molding device in four parts: (i) the posterior shell (cradle), which is emplaced over and around the ear to be corrected; it adheres to the skin of the head; (ii) a retractor for shaping the rim of the pinna; (iii) a conchal former for molding the concha, the central hollow of the ear; and (iv) an anterior shell that fits atop, affixes the interior parts, and locks onto the cradle, to cover and protect the ear. After initiating treatment with the device, the physician monitors the progress of the correction at 2-weeks post- emplacement to effect adjustments to the device and to observe the defect- correction progress; the usual treatment regimen is 6‚Äì8 weeks. When the treatment is initiated in the first week of the infant's life, tissue-molding correction can yield a non-surgical otoplasty outcome comparable to that of surgical otoplasty. The study, Ear Molding in Newborn Infants with Auricular Deformities (2010), reported the efficacy of the EarWell device in correcting deformities of the antihelix, the triangular fossa, the helical rim, and an over-prominent conchal-mastoid angle, in 831 ear deformities, in 488 newborn infants who featured: (i) prominent ear, (cup ear): 373 ears (45%); (ii) lop ear: 224 ears (27%); mixed-type ear deformities: 83 ears (10%) all with associated conchal crus; Stahl's ear: 66 ears (8.0%); helical rim deformity: 58 ears (7.0%); conchal crus: 25 ears (3.0%); and cryptotia: 2 ears (0.2%). Bilateral deformities (both ears) occurred in 340 patients (70%); unilateral deformities occurred in 148 patients (30%); and 58 infant ears (34 patients) were corrected with the EarWell system, with a 90 per cent rate of successful correction. Application of the tissue-molding device at 1-week after the child's birth proved most efficacious in achieving a successful correction, because, when the correction was initiated at 3-weeks from birth, the lessened malleability of the cartilage and tissues of the ear reduced the successful deformity correction rate to 50 per cent. =Ear Buddies= The Ear Buddies splints are fitted to the gully of the ear and affixed with narrow strips of adhesive tape, thereby forming a tissue-molding device that corrects (re-forms) the deformity. The splint's pressure upon the ear cartilage counters the ear's tendency to protrude, whilst maintaining the proper contours of the entire ear. The splints are curved and pliable, and can be molded specifically to the proportions of the patient's ear, as required by the particular defect or deformity to be managed. The device is effective only when applied as such, when both elements (splint and fastener tape) are jointly applied to the deformed ear, therefore, only taping the ears to the head, without the splints, is therapeutically ineffective, and might risk either flattening or notching the helical rim. The corrective splint is emplaced by inserting it to the rim of the gully of the deformed ear, then rolling over the ear-edge onto the splint, and fastening it with adhesive tape. Afterwards, the splinted ear is affixed to the side of the head with adhesive tape. In the case of ears without a gully, helix (rim), or antihelix (common prominent-ear characteristics), the splint is emplaced slightly away from the ear-edge, which then is rolled onto the splint in order to be shaped into a proper helix (ear rim), and also to facilitate the re-formation of the antihelix. In the case of Stahl's ear deformity (characterized either by a bulging or a kinked gully), the splint is firmly emplaced upon the defect or deformity, fastened in place, and affixed to the side of the head. Therefore, to achieve a successful, non-surgical ear-correction outcome, the infant wears the Ear Buddies for 24 hours daily during the recommended splintage period; which is determined thus, if he or she is splinted at: * birth, 2 weeks of splintage. * 1 month of age, 1 month of splintage. * 2 months of age, 2 months of splintage. * 3 months of age, 2.5 months of splintage. * 4‚Äì6 months, at least 3 months of splintage. * more than 6 months, 4 months of splintage. The successful functioning of the Ear Buddies device (splint and fastener tape) requires that the skin of the infant's ears be dry and cleaned of dead skin and natural oils, so that the adhesive of the fastener tape not fail to respectively affix the splint to the ear, and the splinted ear to the side of the head. Furthermore, in the course of the splinting-correction treatment regimen, it is especially important to monitor that the fastener tape not adhere too tightly, lest it not allow the skin to breathe, which might lead to skin erosion that then would interfere with the successful re-molding of the infantile pinna (external ear) into an ear of normal size, contour, and proportions.Ear Buddies Splints ‚Äî How to fit Ear Buddies Splints. www.earbuddies.co.uk. =See also= * Ear shaping * Plastic surgery * Maxillofacial surgery * Otolaryngology Notes References External links *Otoplasty Flash animation * The Papers of Redford C.

Coville was first published in 1977 and has written over 100 books. Biography Coville was born on May 16, 1950 in Syracuse, New York, where he resided . Bruce Coville's father (born Arthur Farrington) was adopted by his aunt, where he adopted her surname of Coville. Growing up in what he called \\"farm country\\", Coville realized his bisexuality in his teens. While waiting to publish his first novel, Coville was employed in a number of professions including toymaker, gravedigger, cookware salesman, assembly line worker, and elementary school teacher working with second grade students and fourth grade students. Coville is wed to Katherine n√©e Dietz (married when Coville was nineteen), and the two of them have three children: \\"a son, Orion, born in 1970; a daughter, Cara, born in 1975; and another son, Adam, born in 1981.\\" Literature Coville began his love of books as a child, reading \\"Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, and zillions of comic books\\". He read \\"books that made [him] laugh, but also made [him] shiver in terror.\\" Wanting to impart those sorts of feeling to others is what spurred his love of writing. Coville knew he wanted to be a writer by his mid-teens, and by age 19 he \\"never looked back.\\" His first book, The Foolish Giant, a picture book illustrated by his wife, Katherine Coville, was published in 1977. With no set paradigm for writing, Coville has successfully tried everything from writing from a strict outline to \\"writing from the seat of my pants.\\" , he uses what he calls an \\"ever-expanding outline\\" where he outlines the beginning and end of a novel, and works to fill in the middle later. Coville has written over 100 books for young adults, with translations in over a dozen languages. He has said that even with over 100 books under his belt, it gets harder and harder to write each successive book; he's concerned with living up to the work already written as well as not repeating himself. Coville is also the co- founder of Full Cast Audio, an audiobook company devoted to recording full- cast, unabridged copies of young adult fiction. =Awards= Coville has been the recipient of three Golden Duck Awards. He won first in 1992 for the novel My Teacher Glows in the Dark, in 2000 for I Was a 6th Grade Alien, and in 2006 for producing an audio adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's The Rolling Stones. In 2000, NESFA presented Coville with the Skylark Award for contributing significantly to science fiction, both through work in the field and by exemplifying the personal qualities which made the late \\"Doc\\" Smith well-loved by those who knew him. In 2012, Coville was the 23rd recipient of the \\"Empire State Award for Excellence in Literature for Young People\\" as awarded by the New York Library Association. =Books= References External links  * Robyn Tallis (shared pseudonym) at LC Authorities, with 8 records Category:1950 births Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st- century American novelists Category:American children's writers Category:American male novelists Category:American young adult novelists Category:Bisexual men Category:Bisexual writers Category:LGBT novelists Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Living people Category:Writers from Syracuse, New York Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:Novelists from New York (state) ","title":"Bruce Coville"},{"id":"1261745","text":"Mike Hunter (born 1947) was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the riding of Nanaimo, he served in that capacity from 2001 to 2005.

As of June 2015, the network operated stations in Toronto, Ontario (where its studios and offices were located), Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta, and Vancouver, British Columbia. All of its stations were licensed as rebroadcasters of its flagship station, CKAV-FM in Toronto. The network's administrative office was located in Ohsweken, Ontario, on the Six Nations Indian reserve near Brantford.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2015-84 The stations' music programming consisted mainly of adult contemporary music (including both mainstream and indigenous artists), along with specialty programs focusing on aboriginal-oriented content. On June 25, 2015, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission revoked Voices Radio's broadcast licenses effective July 25, 2015, citing a long-term history of non-compliance with conditions of their licenses.\\"CRTC Revokes Licences of Aboriginal Voices Radio (AVR)\\". Broadcaster, June 26, 2015. The CRTC issued a call for applications for new radio services in the markets vacated by the network, with special priority given to new First Nations services. The suspension was stayed on July 23, 2015 by the Federal Court of Appeal, pending the outcome of a request for a leave to appeal the CRTC's decision. The stay was lifted on November 10, 2016 when AVR lost its appeal and the network left the air shortly afterwards. History Aboriginal Voices Radio Network (AVR) was founded in 1998 by a group of high-profile aboriginal Canadians, including actor Gary Farmer, playwright, novelist and author Tomson Highway, filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin and actress/producer Jennifer Podemski. The brand descended from Aboriginal Voices magazine, edited by Farmer, which published from 1993 to 1999, and Aboriginal Voices Festival which ran annually in Toronto from 1998 to 2000. Other founders and key contributors to creation of the network included project manager and training coordinator Brian Wright-McLeod, Christopher Spence and Andre Morriseau (production and programming), John Matthews and Mark MacLeod (licensing), Robert Templeton and J. Robert Wood (corporate funding), Elaine Bomberry, David Deleary, Sherman Maness, Nicole Robertson, Minnie Two Shoes and Doug Bingley (strategic advice). The network's original scope was to feature programming produced primarily by and for Aboriginal people in Canada, featuring music and personalities from around the world. AVR's first station, CFIE-FM in Toronto, was licensed by the CRTC in 2000. CFIE changed its callsign to CKAV in 2006. AVR had previously operated on 106.3 FM (JUMP FM) for a short 6 day period in 1998 during the Aboriginal Voices Festival at Harbourfront Centre in Toronto. The network faced technical and logistical problems which have prevented it from launching some of its stations; and the original found here and management were forced out by 2004. The network had applied to the CRTC for extensions five or six times as of the end of 2005. Since then, however, the network had moved forward with most of the approved licenses. In 2009, the network surrendered its licenses for transmitters in Kitchener, Ontario (CKAV-FM-8, 102.5 MHz)CRTC Decision 2009-177 and Montreal (CKAV-FM-10, 106.7 MHz).CRTC Decision 2009-178 On August 20, 2009, the CRTC approved an application by Canadian Hellenic Cable Radio (CHCR) to amend the broadcasting licence for its station in Montreal at 106.3 MHz, a second adjacent frequency to CKAV-FM-10 at 106.7 FM, requiring AVR to find an alternative frequency in the event of any interference with the signal of CKAV-FM-10.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-508 As of January 2011, CHCR's station, CKIN-FM, has signed on at 106.3 MHz. Another broadcaster, Evanov Communications, has since filed an application for a new station at 106.7 serving the western suburb of Hudson in January 2012;Canadian Radio News at Facebook, January 20, 2012.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2012-29, January 20, 2012. that station, since becoming CHSV-FM, was approved in October 2012.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-576 English-language FM radio station in Hudson/St-Lazare, CRTC, October 19, 2012 AVR's outlet in Ottawa, CKAV-FM-9 95.7 MHzDecision CRTC 2001-627 was on air until early October 2014, but has been silent since that time. It never returned to air, though it was still listed on its website among the other stations broadcasting. In December 2014, AVR renamed itself to Voices Radio, as its scope expanded out of the aboriginal realm and more into music from mainstream artists, generally bent towards adult contemporary. In February 2015, Voices Radio began to air old- time radio programs from the United States, nightly from 10 pm to 12 Midnight local time. =Loss of broadcast licensing= On March 11, 2015, Voices Radio applied with the CRTC to renew all five station licences (including the closed Ottawa outlet), which were to expire on August 31, 2015. On June 25, 2015, the CRTC denied the renewals, revoked their broadcast licenses, and ordered Voices Radio to cease broadcasting by July 25, 2015. The commission cited repeated, long-term failures by Voices Radio to adhere to the requirements of its licenses, such as a failure to broadcast a sufficient amount of local news content in each of its markets that reflects stories of interest to their respective aboriginal communities, and failing to submit annual financial and business reports, program logs, and tapes of broadcast days to the CRTC. The CRTC intends to hold a call for applications for new aboriginal-focused broadcasters to take on CKAV's frequencies. The CRTC's suspension of licence in all the network's cities, except for Ottawa, was suspended on July 23, 2015, pending an application by the station for a leave to appeal the CRTC's decision. The appeal was heard on November 8, 2016 and on November 10, the Federal Court of Appeal issued a ruling upholding the CRTC's revocation of AVR's license.http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2016/2016fca275/2016fca275.html?autocompleteStr=Aboriginal%20voices&autocompletePos;=2 =Successors= In August 2015, the CRTC issued a call for new licenses to replace Voices Radio in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa. On February 23, 2016, the CRTC announced that they had received twelve applications for the new stations: two applications for stations in Vancouver, three for Calgary, three for Edmonton, two for Toronto and two for Ottawa. The five organizations that applied were the Aboriginal Multi-Media Society (owner of Alberta's CFWE radio network), Watwatay Native Communications Society, Northern Native Broadcasting (Terrace), VMS Media Group, and First Peoples Radio‚Äîa subsidiary of the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network).http://mediaincanada.com/2016/02/23/next-steps-for-urban-aboriginal- radio/ The licenses for Voices Radio remained in effect, pending results of their appeal, though the CRTC subsequently announced that Voices Radio's outlets in Calgary and Edmonton had ceased operations, leaving Toronto and Vancouver as being the only stations in the Voices Radio group still broadcasting as of February 2016.CRTC News Release: \\"CRTC receives 12 applications for radio stations serving urban Indigenous communities\\", February 23, 2016. First Peoples Radio were granted licenses to operate stations in Toronto (CFPT-FM) and Ottawa (CFPO-FM) on AVR's former frequencies. Northern Native Broadcasting (Terrace) was awarded AVR's former Vancouver frequency and will broadcast as CKUR-FM, and AVR's former frequencies in Edmonton and Calgary were awarded to the Aboriginal Multi-Media Society. The new Calgary station, CJWE-FM, signed on in June 2018 with a similar format to CFWE.

The band was formed by Jean-Marie Ahanda, and included the guitarist Zanzibar, who remains well known for innovative attachment of foam rubber to the bridge of his guitar, which made the instrument sound like a traditional balafon. Zanzibar's death in 1988 threatened to end the band's future, but they continued performing and recording. Their first LP was Hot Heads, which was also the first full-length recording of bikutsi, and contained lyrics which addressed social issues.

Each flower has six triply veined tepals which are long and slightly hooded or boat-shaped at their tips. The stamens consist of a pollen- producing anther about long with a filament of similar length or slightly longer. The central style is long. Seeds are produced in a capsule, long, on stalks (pedicels) which lengthen to up to . The inflorescences carry plantlets at the tips of their branches, which eventually droop and touch the soil, developing adventitious roots. The stems (scapes) of the inflorescence are called \\"stolons\\" in some sources, but this term is more correctly used for stems which do not bear flowers and have roots at the nodes. Taxonomy Chlorophytum comosum was first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg as Anthericum comosum in the 1794 volume of Prodromus Plantarum Capensium, Thunberg's work on the plants of South Africa.Thunberg, Carl Peter. 1794. Prodromus Plantarum Capensium. p. 63. It was subsequently moved to a number of different genera, including Phalangium, Caesia, Hartwegia Nees and Hollia, before receiving its current placement in Chlorophytum by Jacques in 1862. The species has been confused with Chlorophytum capense (L.) Voss by some authors, but this is a different species. =Intra-specific variation= Fleshy roots of pot-grown Chlorophytum comosum There are three described varieties of the species: the autonym C. comosum var. comosum has strap-shaped narrow leaves and is found along forest margins, C. comosum var. bipindense has broader, petiolate leaves with stripes on the underside and the inflorescences are 2‚Äì3 times the length of the leaves, and C. comosum var. sparsiflorum also has broader leaves that narrow to the base and usually lacks a petiole and the striping on the underside of the leaf and the inflorescences are up to two times the length of the leaves. The latter two are rain forest- dwelling taxa that had earlier been described as separate species, but botanists Axel Dalberg Poulsen and Inger Nordal reduced the taxa to varieties of C. comosum in 2005.Poulsen, AD, and I Nordal. 2005. A phenetic analysis and revision of Guineo-Congolean rain forest taxa of Chlorophytum (Anthericaceae). Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 148: 1-20. Delimitation of species boundaries within the genus Chlorophytum is reported to be difficult, possibly because of several evolutionary radiations into forest environments that led to morphological aspects that are too similar to reliably distinguish separate species. The evidence given to support this is the widespread distribution of most taxa in the genus and poor seed dispersal, leading to the conclusion of deeper evolutionary divergence among the taxa. C. comosum 'Variegatum' The three described varieties in C. comosum could be an example of this convergent evolution of leaf shape among the forest-dwelling varieties from species of disparate origin, leading to the species C. comosum being polyphyletic, instead of the traditional view of morphological divergence among the varieties within the species with the assumption of a common origin (monophyly). The widespread C. comosum var. comosum has slender, near linear leaves that lack a petiole similar to plants found in cultivation and is only found growing at the margins of the rain forest. The two other varieties, C. comosum var. sparsiflorum and C. comosum var. bipindense, possess petioles and have broader leaves necessary for collecting more light in the shady Guineo- Congolean rain forest. A study published in 2005 used 16 morphological characters and was unable to delimit species boundaries among these three taxa, so they were relegated to varietal status. A follow-up study published in 2008 provided preliminary evidence from phylogenetic analysis of plastid and nuclear DNA sequences that established samples from disparate collections sites identified as C. comosum were polyphyletic.Bjor√•, CS, A Hemp, G Hoell, and I Nordal. 2008. A taxonomic and ecological analysis of two forest Chlorophytum taxa (Anthericaceae) on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Plant Systematics and Evolution, 274: 243-253. Distribution Chlorophytum comosum has a widespread native distribution in Africa, being native to six of the 10 World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions regions of Africa (West Tropical Africa, West-Central Tropical Africa, Northeast Tropical Africa, East Tropical Africa, South Tropical Africa and Southern Africa). Cultivation Chlorophytum comosum 'Variegatum' in a hanging basket showing the plantlets Chlorophytum comosum is a popular houseplant. The species with all-green leaves forms only a small proportion of plants sold. More common are two variegated cultivars: * C. comosum 'Vittatum' has mid-green leaves with a broad central white stripe. It is often sold in hanging baskets to display the plantlets. The long stems are white. * C. comosum 'Variegatum' has darker green leaves with white margins. It is generally smaller than the previous cultivar. The long stems are green. Both cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). Spider plants are easy to grow, being able to thrive in a wide range of conditions. They will tolerate temperatures down to , but grow best at temperatures between and . Plants can be damaged by high fluoride or boron levels. The NASA Clean Air Study determined that this plant was effective at removing common household air toxins formaldehyde and xylene. Spider plants have also been shown to reduce indoor air pollution in the form of formaldehyde, and approximately 70 plants would neutralize the formaldehyde released by materials in a representative (ca. ) energy-efficient house, assuming each plant occupies a 3.8 L pot.

There were two institutions with this name, at different times, 1917‚Äì1932 and 1963‚Äì1965. 1917‚Äì1932 The VSNKh of the first period was the supreme organ of the management of the economy, mainly of the industry. =Foundation= The VSNKh was launched on December 5, 1917 through a decree of the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) and All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.Alec Nove, An Economic History of the USSR. New Edition. London: Penguin Books, 1989; pg. 42. Its stated purpose was to \\"plan for the organization of the economic life of the country and the financial resources of the government\\". It was subordinated to the Sovnarkom. The recently established All-Russian Council for Workers' Control was dissolved into the new organisation. It had rights of confiscation and expropriation. The first Chairman was Osinsky and with Bukharin, Georgy Oppokov (Lomov), Milyutin, Sokolnikov, and Vasili Schmidt also appointed to the Council. =Reorganisation= After the creation of the Soviet Union in 1923 it was transformed into the joint all-Union and republican People's Commissariat. In 1932, it was reorganized into three People's Commissariats: of heavy industry, light industry and forestry. In each of the union republics of the Soviet Union, subordinate organisations existed. These were referred to as –í–°–ù–• followed by their union republic acronym. (for example: –í–°–ù–• –ë–°–°–† (VSNKh BSSR) for the Belarusian SSR). The all-union council could be referred to as –í–°–ù–• –°–°–°–† (VSNKh SSSR). The republican VSNKhs had control over small scale, minor industries which used local materials and supplied local markets and which were referred to as \\"enterprises of republican subordination\\". Large scale industrial enterprises (\\"enterprises of union subordination\\") were controlled by one of the industrial sector departments of the all-union VSNKh. =Organisational structure= Within the VSNKh, departments were split into two types. Functional sector departments Departments within the functional sector dealt with decisions relating to finance, planning, economic policy, and research and development. Industrial sector departments Departments of this type were created by decree in 1926 and consisted of \\"chief departments\\", known as glavki (glavnye upravlenija). Heads of all the departments in this sector formed the council of the all-union VSNKh together with representatives from the union republics.

It was subordinated to the Council of Ministers of the USSR and managed industry and construction. Sovnarkhozes were introduced by Nikita Khrushchev in July 1957 in an attempt to combat the centralization and departmentalism of ministries. The USSR was initially divided into 105 economic regions, with sovharknozes being operational and planning management. Simultaneously, a large number of ministries were shut down.

She was an alderman (councillor) for the city of Scarborough, Ontario from 1982 to 1994 and she served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003. From 1995 to 1997 she was a cabinet minister under Mike Harris. Background Born in England, Mushinski emigrated to Canada in 1967 at age twenty-one, and was educated at York University. She worked with the Canadian Mental Health Association before entering political life. She was married to Paul Mushinski JP, but are now divorced. Politics =Municipal= She served as an alderman and councillor in Scarborough, Ontario from 1982 to 1994, and was also a councillor for Metro Toronto in 1987-88. Mushinski also served as a board member of the Scarborough Hospital and the Scarborough Women's Centre. In 1986, Mushinski argued, albeit unsuccessfully, to retain the title alderman rather than switch to the gender neutral term councillor. She said, \\"My gut reaction is one of dismay because I don't know if they've ever taken into consideration the historical significance of the word alderman. I think it trivializes the language and I'm concerned to have to accommodate the quirks of a feminist movement which is trying to bastardize the English language.\\" In 1994, she ran for mayor of Scarborough against fellow councillors Frank Faubert and Maureen Prinsloo. Mushinski's campaign which was similar to those of her colleagues was based on freezing property taxes and increasing the police force to fight rising crime in the city. During the election, a group called the Scarborough Volunteer Citizens' Budget Advisory Committee rated the candidates. They gave Mushinski a score of 0 out of 100; Faubert was given a score of 50 out of 100. Faubert defeated Mushinski by a margin of 30,844 votes. =Provincial= Mushinski was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent New Democratic Party of Ontario David Warner by about 4,000 votes in the riding of Scarborough‚ÄîEllesmere. On June 26, 1995, she was named as Ontario's Minister of Citizenship, Culture and Recreation. In 1995, shortly after the election, Mushinski moved to repeal the employment equity law introduced by the previous NDP government. She said, \\"legislated hiring and promotion quotas are unnecessary, unfair and ineffective.\\" In 1997, Mushinski issued a press release denouncing a gangland style shooting in her riding in which two Tamil men were injured. She said, \\"The Canadian tradition of consultation, co- operation and compromise seems to be lost on these individuals. Canada's strength lies in its long-held belief that immigrants to this country are starting fresh, and should embrace a new openness to diversity and respect for the law of the land.\\" Scarborough Mayor Frank Faubert said the release went too far. He called the statement, \\"a smear on the entire Tamil community.\\" During a cabinet shuffle later that year she was dropped from cabinet. There was some speculation that although culture was part of her portfolio she had made few friends in the arts community. In 1998 she was made Parliamentary Assistant to the Premier. In the provincial election of 1999, Mushinski was re-elected by about 4,000 votes over Liberal candidate Costas Manios; NDP candidate and labour leader Sid Ryan was third. During this term she served as Parliamentary Assistant to both the Premier and the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. In May 2000, Mushinski introduced a private members' bill called the Judicial Accountability Act. The bill called for the publication of judges' sentencing records. It would have created a list of sentences imposed by judges and their reasons for not awarding the maximum possible sentence. Upon introduction of the bill she said she wanted to \\"motivate lenient judges to give out tougher sentences.\\" She warned that judges that didn't play along with this goal might be subject to performance reviews. The bill was opposed by the Criminal Lawyer's Association. Alan Gold, president of the association said, \\"It's a blatant attack on the independence of the judiciary, it's an attempt to intimidate judges into imposing higher sentences and that's simply inexcusable.\\" Attorney General Jim Flaherty initially was supportive of the bill. He said, \\"I think the public is entitled to know what sentences are being handed down by judges.\\" But after considerable opposition from the legal community he distanced himself from the legislation. The bill died on the order paper when the legislature recessed for the summer. In the 2003 provincial election, she was defeated by Liberal candidate Brad Duguid by 10,012 votes. =Cabinet positions= References External links * Category:1946 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:21st-century Canadian women politicians Category:Living people Category:Metro Toronto councillors Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:People from Scarborough, Toronto Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs Category:Women government ministers of Canada Category:Women MPPs in Ontario ","title":"Marilyn Mushinski"},{"id":"1261779","text":"GholƒÅm-Hossein BanƒÅn (; 5 May 1911 ‚Äì 27 February 1986) was an Iranian musician and singer. One of the most prominent Iranian singers of the 20th century, he was renowned for the quality of his voice. Biography Born in Tehran, BanƒÅn descended from a prominent family \\"with a background in government service\\". His father, Karim Khan BanƒÅn ol-Dowleh (son of Mohammad-Taqi Mirza Fazlollah Khan Mostowfi Nuri) was an admirer of traditional music. His mother was related to the ruling Qajar dynasty of Iran; she was the daughter of Mohammad Taqi Mirza Rokn ed-Dowleh, a brother of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (1848‚Äì1896). Margaret Caton notes that BanƒÅn grew up in an environment where artistic development was fostered; his father sang and played the tar, while his mother played piano. BanƒÅn's maternal aunt played the ney, and his sisters studied the tar with Morteza Neidavoud. From the age of six Gholam-Hossein BanƒÅn began to take lessons in singing and playing the piano and organ through the encouragement of Morteza Neidavoud who was quick to recognize him as musically talented. GholƒÅm-Hossein's first teachers were his parents. He subsequently studied with MirzƒÅ TƒÅher ZiƒÅ oz-ZƒÅkerin RasƒÅ'√≠ and NƒÅser Seif. Ali-Naqi Vaziri later introduced him to the acclaimed Rouhollah KhƒÅleghi. BanƒÅn joined the Iranian National Music Association in 1942, and appeared on Iranian National Radio that same year. He then joined the orchestra of the distinguished pianist JavƒÅd Maroufi, becoming the lead vocalist. In 1957 or 1958, BanƒÅn became blind in his right eye following a car accident. BanƒÅn died 7:00 pm on Thursday 27 February 1986 in Iranmehr Hospital in Gholhak, Tehran. He is still remembered by lovers of traditional Persian music.

Its shallow, angled sides are designed to reflect heat into the room, and its streamlined throat minimizes turbulence, thereby carrying away smoke with little loss of heated room air. History Rumford applied his knowledge of heat to the improvement of fireplaces in the 1790s. He made them smaller and shallower with widely angled covings so they would radiate better. And he streamlined the throat, or in his words \\"rounded off the breast\\" so as to \\"remove those local hindrances which forcibly prevent the smoke from following its natural tendency to go up the chimney...\\" Rumford wrote two papersThe Collected Works of Count Rumford; Vol. 2; Sanborn Brown, ed.; Harvard Univ. Press; 1969http://www.rumford.com/chimneyfireplacesa.html detailing his improvements on fireplaces in 1796 and 1798. He was well known and widely read in his lifetime and almost immediately in the 1790s his \\"Rumford fireplace\\" became state-of-the-art worldwide. Subsequent testing of Rumford's designs has shown that their efficiency would qualify them as clean-burning stoves. Principle of action Fireplace before changes Fireplace before changes The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in London when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. He and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled, and they added a choke to the chimney to create a circulation of air inside the chimney. In the unmodified chimney, smoke rises up the chimney propelled only by buoyancy -- the heated gases from the fireplace being lighter than the surrounding air. This is especially ineffective when the fire is first lit, and the temperature and density of the smoke are closer to the ambient air. Thanks to the discontinuity produced by Rumford's brick \\"smoke shelf\\", the flow of smoke gases up the chimney became detached from the outside wall at the lip of the shelf. This set up a counter-circulation of outside air which flowed down the backside of the chimney, while a mixture of outside air and smoke flowed up the opposite side. The circulation inside the chimney, and above the smoke shelf, created a dynamic pressure in which the smoke gases were driven up one side of the chimney and cold air was pulled down the other. The air mixed with the rising smoke and increased the combined flow rising up the flue. It produced a circulating air-smoke flow, driving the smoke up into the chimney rather than lingering and often choking the residents. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions and became smoke-free as well as more efficient. Thompson became a celebrity when news of his success became widespread. In an age when fires were the principal source of heat, this simple alteration in the design of fireplaces was copied widely. Plan of Rumford fireplace Section of Rumford fireplace Usage Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Count Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. There are still many original Rumford fireplaces, often buried behind newer renovations. He also invented a cast iron stove, also known as the Rumford stove, which competed successfully with the famous Franklin stove. Both devices gave much more control over the air flow into the fire, and were much more efficient users of fuel. Such stoves were expensive, but saved so much fuel as to justify the cost of installation very quickly. They in turn inspired the development of the kitchen range, also made in cast iron, which gave yet more control of the fire and also was used directly for cooking purposes.

At over 520,000 words, it is one of the longest novels ever written. Due to the length of the novel, the paperback version had to be split into two separate volumes, known as To Green Angel Tower: Part 1 and Part 2. In the United Kingdom, the two paperback volumes were titled To Green Angel Tower: Siege and To Green Angel Tower: Storm. The saga follows a young man named Simon as he is caught up in an epic adventure. Plot introduction As the Storm King's power grows, the loyal allies of Prince Josua struggle to rally their forces at the Stone of Farewell. There, Simon and the surviving members of the League of the Scroll attempt to unravel a prophecy that may ultimately allow them to strike down the undead Storm King and bring peace to the kingdom. This epic saga concludes as Simon travels back to castle Hayholt to confront Ineluki. Plot summary Paperback cover for Part 1 of To Green Angel Tower. The story begins with the forces of Prince Josua Lackhand rallied at the Stone of Farewell, where the icy hand of the Storm King Ineluki has yet to take a deathgrip on the land. The remaining members of the League of the Scroll have also gathered at the Stone in hopes of unraveling an ancient prophecy. If deciphered, it could reveal to Josua and his army the only means of striking down the unslayable Storm King. After Simon and Binabik have their reunion, they come to the realization that Memory - one of the three Great Swords recognized as being key to defeating the Storm King - is one and the same with Bright-Nail, old King John‚Äôs sword that was buried with him not three years previously. The trouble is, the grave of King John Presbyter lies in the shadow of the Hayholt, the stronghold of King Elias, and between the Stone of Farewell and Hayholt marches the army Elias has sent to besiege the defenders. Meanwhile, Miriamele, Elias‚Äôs daughter who has joined Josua‚Äôs cause, is an unhappy prisoner on the ship of a lascivious and ambitious lordling to whom she has surrendered her virtue knowing only too late of his true nature. Another princess, Maegwin of Hernystir, falls deeper into madness, leading her people in a seemingly futile resistance against Elias‚Äôs allies who have conquered her kingdom, and deep in the ancient forest of Aldheorte, the immortal Sithi are mustering for a final conflict. While Josua and his army must make a final stand to try to delay the forces of King Elias, Simon embarks upon a quest to Hayholt Castle to try to obtain the last of the three legendary swords and use their hidden magics to defeat The Storm King Ineluki and restore peace to Osten Ard once and for all.

It involves combining multiple track stems into one, allowing more room for overdubbing when using tape recorders with a limited set of tracks. It is also used to simplify mixdowns. The two most common methods consist of * Dubbing tracks between two tape recorders (or tracks on a multitrack recorder) connected through a mixing console * Dubbing tracks internally, through the onboard mixer of many machines, including Portastudios and similar multitrackers. In both cases, a new instrument, voice, or other material may be added with each bounce, depending on the setup's mixing capabilities. In analog recording, the audio quality normally decreases with each generation, while in digital recording, the quality is usually preserved. In either case, the most leeway comes with having the best possible source material. Early examples The method was employed by Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson during the 1960s. For the recording of Pet Sounds (1966), Wilson created the instrumentals of songs using a 4-track recorder. He then bounced the material onto one track of an 8-track recorder, using the remaining tracks for vocal overdubs. This meant that the album could not be suitably mixed in stereo, because the instrumental parts were locked in monaural. In 1997, advances in recording technology allowed engineer Mark Linett to resync the original first-generation instrumental stems with the second-generation overdubbed vocals for the compilation The Pet Sounds Sessions. Other terms Ping pong is also a term of derision, in particular applied to early commercial stereo recordings of the late 1950s to mid-1960s which do not have a convincing stereo image or sound-stage. Such recordings were often made in two-track form for mixing in mono, but released as authentic stereo recordings.

They emerged from the mid-1960s Irish roots revival, along with groups such as The Dubliners and the Clancy Brothers. The founding line-up in May 1966 was Johnny Moynihan, Andy Irvine and \\"Galway Joe\\" Dolan. First line-up Before creating the band in 1966, Irvine, Moynihan and Dolan had met in Dublin and had performed and travelled together, on and off, around Ireland; Irvine and Dolan hitch-hiked together around Europe (Munich, Vienna and Rome) in late 1965. The name 'Sweeney's Men' was inspired by Dolan's reading of Flann O'Brien's comic novel At Swim-Two- Birds, which depicts the mad, anti-religious, tree-leaping pagan King Sweeney of Antrim. The band's manager was Eamonn O'Doherty, and he and the band travelled in a red VW van. The band often travelled to Milltown Malbay to enjoy musical sessions with the piper Willie Clancy. The early days of the band have been described by Irvine in his song \\"My heart's tonight in Ireland\\". Second line-up In June 1967, Dolan decided to travel to Israel to fight in the Six-Day War and was replaced by Terry Woods. Woods who played the 12-string guitar, had travelled in the US and studied the American folk tradition brought an American musical influence to the group.Carol Clerk. 2009. Kiss My Arse: The Story of the Pogues. Omnibus Press, 4 November 2009 At the time, they played the bouzouki, mandolin, guitar, tin whistle, harmonica, concertina and 5-string banjo. This line-up recorded their first full-length album, Sweeney's Men in 1968.Colin Larkin. 2011. The Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Omnibus Press, p. 3299 The band did not stick to Irish songs exclusively, since all three were big fans of American music and their repertoire included American songs like \\"Tom Dooley\\" alongside traditional songs like \\"Willy O'Winsbury\\" from the Scottish tradition. Irvine left the band in May 1968, to travel around Eastern Europe.Andy Irvine. Aiming for the Heart. BoD ‚Äì Books on Demand, 2008 Third line-up Irvine was replaced by Henry McCullough, who had been repatriated to Ireland while on an Eire Apparent tour, owing to visa problems. McCullough played electric guitar, and his tenure saw the band explore more progressive, psychedelic territory. After playing with Sweeney's Men at the Cambridge Folk Festival, McCullough left in July 1968 to join Joe Cocker's Grease Band, and was briefly replaced by Al O'Donnell (born Alastair Noel O'Donnell, 8 December 1943, Harold's Cross, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland, died 3 September 2015, Rathdrum, County Wicklow, Ireland). Final line-up It was as a duo that Woods and Moynihan recorded the band's second, and final, album The Tracks of Sweeney, released in 1969 and including some of their own compositions, such as Moynihan's \\"Standing on the Shore\\". Shortly after this release, they broke up, on 22 November 1969. A new Irish-English folk super-group was almost formed in 1970, with Moynihan, Irvine (now back from his travels), Woods and his wife Gay, plus Ashley Hutchings joining on bass, but this never happened. Break-up and follow-on projects Following the break-up of Sweeney's Men, four of the members played in other notable bands: *Andy Irvine: Planxty, Patrick Street, East Wind, Mozaik, LAPD, Usher's Island, and several duos (with D√≥nal Lunny, Paul Brady, Mick Hanly, Dick Gaughan, Rens van der Zalm and Luke Plumb) while also pursuing a solo career. *Johnny Moynihan: Planxty, De Dannan, Fleadh Cowboys, Moonshine, solo career and with Anne Briggs and Andrew McNamara. *Terry Woods: Steeleye Span, Gay & Terry Woods, The Woods Band and The Pogues. *Henry McCullough: The Grease Band and Wings. Reunions In 1986, Moynihan, Woods and McCullough reunited for a special edition of the BP Fallon Orchestra, a radio show hosted by Dave Fanning of RT√â Radio.Described and archived here: https://fanningsessions.wordpress.com/2015/03/01/henry- mccullough-on-the-bp-fallon-orchestra/ Irvine and Moynihan were re-united for a one-off gig as Sweeney's Men in Rostrevor, County Down on 22 July 2007, when the band was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the local Fiddler's Green Festival; Dolan was unable to participate due to illness, so Paul Brady agreed to deputise. Irvine wrote \\"Had hoped we might 'blague' Galway Joe Dolan into doing it but he hasn't been on a stage for about two lifetimes and that wasn't going to work. Johnny had hit on the great idea of asking Paul Brady to play with us as Paul had stood in for Dolan at a gig in Limerick in 1967 after Joe's speedy departure for Israel and the 6 Day War\\". Irvine, Moynihan and Woods played together once again on 16 & 17 June 2012, as part of Irvine's 70th Birthday party concerts at Vicar Street in Dublin, a dozen tracks from the shows were released by Irvine as a live album.https://www.discogs.com/Andy-Irvine-Sweeneys-Men-Mozaik-3-Andy-Irvine- Paul-Brady-LAPD-70th-Birthday-Concert-At-Vicar-St-2012/release/6170916 It worked so well that they gigged again in Ireland later in 2012 and also played five full-house gigs in Galway, Kilkenny, Cork, Dublin and Limerick during November 2013. Their play list included some new songs as well as old standards, in performances that demonstrated that they retain their old vitality and virtuosity across a wide range of instruments.Andy Irvine official website. Retrieved 11 November 2013. Legacy A significant innovation that Sweeney's Men contributed to Irish music was Moynihan's introduction of the bouzouki,http://www.lyrics-youtube.com/lyrics/odonoghues- andy-irvine-kBz8PUWAczg with the tuning of GDAD', one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin instead of the traditional Greek tuning of CFAD'. For a band with such a short lifespan, their influence was considerable. Thanks largely to Irvine, they helped evolve a more structured approach to the accompaniment of ballads. Irvine's interaction with Moynihan‚Äôs bouzouki playing initially, and then with Lunny's up to and including Planxty, consolidated this contrapuntal approach.

It is traditionally made of porcelain, but glass and plastic funnels are also available. On top of the funnel-shaped part there is a cylinder with a fritted glass disc/perforated plate separating it from the funnel. The Hirsch funnel has a similar design; it is used similarly, but for smaller quantities of material. The main difference is that the plate of a Hirsch funnel is much smaller, and the walls of the funnel angle outward instead of being vertical. A funnel with a fritted glass disc can be used immediately. For a funnel with a perforated plate, filtration material in the form of filter paper is placed on the plate, and the filter paper is moistened with a liquid to prevent initial leakage. The liquid to be filtered is poured into the cylinder and drawn through the perforated plate/fritted glass disc by vacuum suction. The main advantage in using this type of filtration is that it proceeds much more quickly (several orders of magnitude) than simply allowing the liquid to drain through the filter medium via the force of gravity. It is essential that the amount of liquid being used is limited to less than what would overflow the flask; otherwise, the liquid will be drawn into the vacuum equipment. If the vacuum is provided by a water flow device, an overflow of the liquid could result in the spilling of a hazardous liquid into the wastewater stream, a potential violation of the law, depending on the liquid. The potential for overflow and the potential for water to be drawn back into the flask can be reduced by using a trap between the flask and the vacuum source. It is used in organic chemistry labs to assist in collecting recrystallized compounds. The suction allows the wet recrystallized compound to dry out such that the pure dried crystal compound is left remaining. However, it is often the case that further drying is required, by an oven or other means, in order to remove as much residual liquid as possible. It is often used in combination with a B√ºchner flask, B√ºchner ring and sinter seals. A vacuum tight seal and stability of the B√ºchner flask and filter are essential during the filtration process. A B√ºchner ring can be used with B√ºchner funnels, flasks, glass crucibles and Gooch crucibles. The wide flange and large surface contact ensures an excellent vacuum tight seal whilst the rings are easy to remove and offer excellent support to even the largest funnels. It is commonly thought to be named after the Nobel Laureate Eduard Buchner (without umlaut), but it is actually named after the industrial chemist Ernst B√ºchner.B√ºchner, Ernst (1888) \\"Filtration vermittelst des Dr. R.

He is the technical director at Arsenal. Club career =Early career= Edu started his career in S√©rie A with Corinthians. While with Corinthians, Edu won the 1998 and 1999 Brasileiro championships, and the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship.Corinthians Squad ‚Äì 2000 FIFA World Club Championship FIFA =Arsenal= After initially planning to join Arsenal in 2000, his transfer was put on hold after it was realised that he was in possession of a fake Portuguese passport. Months later, after qualifying for a European Union (EU) passport (aided by Italian lineage on his father's side), he signed for Arsenal on 16 January 2001 for ¬£6 million. He had a turbulent time early on as his sister was killed in a car accident. His Arsenal debut came in 2001 in a goalless draw tarnished by an injury after 15 minutes against Leicester City. He had replaced Freddie Ljungberg at half time only to be replaced by Dennis Bergkamp minutes later. It was an unfortunate start and he only managed to play in four more matches for the club during that season, one of which was a 0‚Äì3 defeat at home to Middlesbrough in which he contributed an own goal. His first goal for the club came against Grimsby in the League Cup on 27 November 2001. He went on to make a substitute appearance in the 2002 FA Cup Final as Arsenal emerged victorious. He also contributed 14 league appearances, and a goal against Aston Villa, as Arsenal won the 2001‚Äì02 Premier League, with Edu becoming the first Brazilian to win the Premier League. In 2002‚Äì03 Edu made 18 appearances in the Premier League and featured heavily as Arsenal got to the FA Cup final for the third year running. Edu scored in Arsenal's fifth round win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, however injury issues in the latter part of the season meant he was left out of the squad for the final. 2003‚Äì04 season in midfield for Arsenal was seen as his finest season so far in football, he was part of the team which went 49 games unbeaten, (the whole 2003‚Äì04 Premier League season without defeat). He appeared in 30 League games and scored 2 goals, both against Chelsea, he scored the fourth of Arsenal's 5 in a 5‚Äì1 historic win against Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League in November 2003, he made a career high 48 appearances and 7 goals for Arsenal in all competitions. Edu was on the pitch as Arsenal clinched the 2003‚Äì04 Premier League title at White Hart Lane on 25 April 2004. During the season, he made his 100th appearance for Arsenal. Edu enjoyed mixed fortunes in the 2004‚Äì05 season. He missed the start of the season because he was away with Brazil at the Copa Am√©rica. This was followed by speculation over his future at the club as he was in the last year of his contract with Arsenal. Talks with Valencia of Spain in January 2005 failed as the Mestalla outfit were not able to pay the fee Arsenal demanded. Edu only scored two goals for Arsenal in 2004‚Äì05 ‚Äì one was a fine chip in the 2‚Äì0 away win at West Bromwich Albion in May 2005, and the other a penalty kick in a 7‚Äì0 win over Everton in 2005. He did however come on as an extra time substitute as Arsenal won the 2005 FA Cup Final. =Valencia= In May 2005, it was confirmed that he would leave Arsenal in the summer on a Bosman ruling free transfer. Valencia, Juventus, Inter Milan, and Barcelona were hot favourites to secure the signature of Edu, and on 30 May, Valencia announced it had signed him to a five-year deal. Shortly after signing, Edu suffered a pre- season injury that ruled him out of first-team action until 4 April 2006, when he made his debut in the 5‚Äì3 victory over C√°diz. On 3 July 2009, the Brazilian midfielder left Valencia through contractual termination. =Corinthians= After being released in Spain, Edu signed a contract with his former club, the Corinthians, on 6 August 2009, which was to last until 31 December 2011. After playing four matches during the 2010 season, his contract was terminated by mutual consent, and Edu announced his retirement from professional football. International career Edu initially considered playing for the England national team upon gaining a British passport as he did not think he would be picked for Brazil. He finally got a call-up to the Brazilian national team in 2004 and made his debut on 28 April 2004 in a friendly match against Hungary. He played for them in the 2004 Copa Am√©rica and 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, which were both won by Brazil. In the final of the Copa Am√©rica 2004 he scored one of the penalties in the shootout as Brazil defeated Argentina. Post- playing career On 17 March 2011, Corinthians announced that Edu would take over from William Machado as the club's director of football. He also assisted Carlos Queiroz's Iranian national team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. From 2016 to 2019, he was the general coordinator of the Brazilian national team. On 9 July 2019, it was announced that Edu had become Arsenal's first ever technical director. The club's director of football, Raul Sanllehi said: \\"We're very excited that Edu is joining the team.

The process was intended for subsequent use and was adopted for four more films, Midway (1976), Rollercoaster (1977), the theatrical version of Saga of a Star World (1978), the Battlestar Galactica pilot, as well as the compilation film Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack (1979). Sensurround worked by adding extended-range bass for sound effects. The low-frequency sounds were more felt than heard, providing a vivid complement to onscreen depictions of earth tremors, bomber formations, and amusement park rides. The overall trend toward \\"multiplex\\" cinema structures presented challenges that made Sensurround impractical as a permanent feature of cinema. Sensurround helped bring wider recognition to established loudspeaker manufacturer Cerwin- Vega, and aided in establishing a strong reputation for new audio amplifier company BGW Systems. The increased awareness of extended low-frequency sound reproduction that Sensurround brought to film audiences was a factor in the increase in subwoofer sales and in the rise in the number of subwoofer designs in the late 1970s and 1980s. Development =Original design= Sensurround involved the installation of large, low frequency, horn-loaded speakers which contained specially designed 18-inch Cerwin-Vega Model 189 ES drivers in custom black wood cabinets. Three horn configurations were available, Model-C (Corner), Model-W (Folded Bass Bin) and Model-M (Modular). The Model-C and -M horns required stacking in groups of four, increasing effective horn mouth size to achieve the low frequency target. They came with special extenders used to widen the mouths of the horns and take advantage of the theater walls to further increase low frequency extension. The Model-M horn had a dedicated \\"Mouth-Extender\\" available when it was used in the front of the theater. While installation was customized and varied in each theater, the Sensurround horns were typically placed beneath the screen in front and in the back corners of the theater. Often, rows or sections of seats would have to be removed to make room for the large Sensurround horns. In large theaters, up to 20 individual horns might be used along with custom-built bat wings and mouth extenders. Sensurround pseudorandom number generator circuit on the patent, to create low frequency rumble. The original Sensurround design used for Earthquake employed a pseudorandom noise generator, designed by D. Broadus \\"Don\\" Keele, Jr., to create the low-frequency rumble, using recordings of the 1971 Sylmar earthquake as a reference. Two low frequency control tones were printed on the film's mono optical or magnetic track; from the projector, the tones entered a control box in the projection booth, which fed low frequency pseudorandom noise to 1,600 watt BGW 750 audio amplifiers driving the speakers. The control box generated a pseudorandom noise signal with energy between 17 and 120 Hz. The control track method was employed because there was no way to accurately record bass lower than 40 Hz on an optical or magnetic film soundtrack at the time. When receiving the noise signal, the amplifier and subwoofers responded with sound pressures ranging from 100 dB to 120 dB. The resulting rumble could be felt by audience members as well as heard. For the film Earthquake, Sensurround was activated during the quake scenes to augment the conventional soundtrack. In addition, portions of the main soundtrack were redirected to the Sensurround horns to create a partial surround sound effect. The control tones recorded on the film's optical or magnetic track triggered the rumble or surround sound effects as well as controlling their volume and the overall blend of the main soundtrack and low frequency noise effects. Two tones of 25 Hz and 35 Hz were used: these two tones allowed different effects to be activated when desired: the rumble could be turned on or off in the Sensurround horns, the main soundtrack could be sent to the Sensurround horns, the level of both the rumble and the soundtrack coming from the horns could be varied by varying the level of the control tones and the theater's main audio system could be increased in level by up to 8 dB at select points to create a greater dynamic range (MCA called this the \\"Step-Gain\\" function.) For the original version of Sensurround, prints were available in the following formats: *35mm 4-Track Magnetic with Optical Track (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was _not_ usable as a mono optical print. Unlike standard magoptical prints, in which the optical track was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the optical track on magnetic Sensurround prints contained _only_ the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from ‚àí14 to ‚àí6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at ‚àí16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because Earthquake was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run Earthquake without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For Earthquake run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track was used in the normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels. *35mm Mono Optical: These were dual-purpose prints and could be used either with or without Sensurround. The optical track was a composite mix of the program and the control tones and were compatible with any optical playback system. All mono mixes of the Earthquake soundtrack contain the control tones. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from ‚àí28 dB to ‚àí20 dB below 100% modulation. Activation of the Sensurround System occurred at ‚àí30 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, the composite mono soundtrack was used, with its volume and timing regulated by the 25 Hz control tone. *70mm 6-Track Magnetic Stereo: The Sensurround Control Tones were recorded on Tracks 2 and 4 and are 100 Hz instead of 25 Hz and 35 Hz. This was because the magnetic system could not reproduce the very low-frequency control tones reliably. The 100 Hz tone on Track-2 controls the program effects applied to the Sensurround Horns and the 100 Hz tone on Track-4 controls the rumble effect applied to the Sensurround horns. Like the other systems, the level of the 100 Hz tones varies the levels applied to the Sensurround horns and when both control tones are present, the Step/Hi-Gain function is turned on to increase the dynamic range of the main program by 8 dB. Track-3 (Center Front) is applied to the Sensurround system for program sounds. No other signal is recorded on Tracks 2 and 4. 70mm Sensurround prints were issued ONLY outside of the USA. In addition, Earthquake was the only Sensurround film recorded in stereo or issued with 70mm prints. All other Sensurround films were 35mm mono optical in the Sensurround Mod-II or Mod-III format. =Sensurround Mod-II= Even before Earthquake ended its theatrical run, MCA began a program to re- engineer the Sensurround system to enable the recording of the deep bass on a standard 35mm optical soundtrack, with no external rumble generator being required, as well as improve fidelity and the overall effect and to simplify the system. In addition, dbx Type-II noise reduction was incorporated to increase the dynamic range and reduce audible noise created by the optical process. MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns in the front and back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but did not want the dialogue to shift to the back of the theater. Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in Rollercoaster.) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10 Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional optical print. MCA called this re-engineering of the system \\"Sensurround Mod- II\\" and the market name of the system was changed from just \\"Sensurround\\" to the \\"Sensurround Special Effects System\\". Unlike the original version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due to the use of dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16 Hz to 16 kHz and a dynamic range of 86 dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time. It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. Dolby Stereo optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own \\"special effects\\" systems to create Sensurround-type effects. =Sensurround Mod-III= Mod-III Sensurround was a further refinement of the system to allow more control over level, timbre and placement of effects. Instead of a simple wide-range rumble that could be felt and heard, Mod-III used more narrow band extended low frequency effects in the 16‚Äì25 Hz range, in addition to the higher frequency program sounds and surround-sound effect. Thus, scenes could have dialogue and other audio at standard levels, plus the effect of movement from the infrasonic rumble, creating sensations that had not been possible in earlier Sensurround films. Mod-III Sensurround was used in Battlestar Galactica in 1978. Sensurround was a highly successful theatrical sound system. By 1976, when Midway opened, there were over 800 theaters with Sensurround capability in the USA. Worldwide, there were over 2000 Sensurround theaters. During the initial design of the system MCA figured it would be installed in a limited number of theaters across the USA‚Äîperhaps 30 in all‚Äîand that smaller theaters, or theaters in small towns, would not want to bother with the installation or the loss of seating capacity necessitated by the large Sensurround horns. This was quickly disproved: Earthquake premiered with 17 Sensurround installations and by the end of its run over 400 theaters had shown the film in Sensurround. Midway opened with 300 Sensurround-equipped theaters. At first, MCA only rented Sensurround to theaters at a cost of $500 per week, but by the opening of Midway, theaters could purchase the systems outright and MCA had begun to ship the Model-M horns to theaters un-assembled. Theater owners also had the option of purchasing only the Cerwin-Vega drivers and horn cabinet blueprints, buying the wood and making the horn cabinets themselves. MCA made these changes due to the success of the system and because the shipping costs of the heavy Sensurround horns were becoming very expensive. Throughout the history of the Sensurround program, RCA Technical Services performed the theater installations and maintenance. If repairs or replacements were required, the RCA technicians contacted MCA Systems to order needed parts. Because control tones were used to trigger the Sensurround horns, theaters could not generally use the system with their standard films unless a rewiring was done. History =Awards= In 1974, Waldon O. Watson, Richard J. Stumpf, Robert J. Leonard and the Universal City Studios Sound Department received a special Scientific and Engineering Academy Award for \\"the development and engineering of the Sensurround System for motion picture presentation\\". The film Earthquake also won an Academy Award for Best Sound (Ronald Pierce, Melvin M. Metcalfe Sr.). In 1976, MCA was granted for the Sensurround system. =Drawbacks= Sensurround speakers involved expense for theater owners. Rental for speakers cost $500 a month in 1974 and their installation involved the removal of some seats. The extra expense was commercially justifiable as long as it appeared to provide an advantage in drawing audiences. Sensurround made Earthquake a popular \\"event\\" film in 1974 and one of the year's highest- grossing films. Sensurround presented practical challenges, though, in multiplex cinemas where separate theater spaces shared walls. Audiences for The Godfather Part II, which opened the same month (November 1974) as Earthquake, often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when Earthquake was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues; a safety net was installed at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling. When Earthquake was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single- screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as Midway, also tended to play in single-screen cinemas. The success of Star Wars over Rollercoaster in the middle of 1977 demonstrated to theater operators the limits of Sensurround as a guarantor of audience draw. Battlestar Galactica: Saga of a Star World (1978) and Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack (1979) marked the final bows of Sensurround. =Competing processes= The success of Sensurround as an effect led rival studios to develop their own audio enhancements. 20th Century Fox released Damnation Alley (1977) in , and Warner Brothers employed their Megasound process for Altered States (1980), Outland (1981), Wolfen (1981) and Superman II (1981). Cultural references On their 1977 album Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols, the punk rock group the Sex Pistols referenced Sensurround in their song \\"Holidays in the Sun\\" in the opening of the second verse (\\"It's in Sensurround sound in a two inch wall, I was waiting for the communist call\\"). The English gothic rock band The Sisters of Mercy reference Sensurround in the song \\"Body Electric\\" from their 1984 EP Body and Soul. (\\"Through the cables and the underground now The faceless breathless calls, This is Babel, Sensurround now, This place is death with walls\\"). The alternative pop/rock band They Might Be Giants released a song titled \\"Sensurround\\" that was incorporated in the soundtrack to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie and (in a different, faster-paced recording) their EP S-E- X-X-Y. The song makes several references to the innovation, especially as used in Earthquake. An early FoxTrot comic has Jason presenting his dinosaur movie in Sensurround. In the 1993 film Matinee, Mant!, Matinee's film-within-a-film, was filmed in \\"Rumble-Rama\\", a not-so-subtle nod to Sensurround. The alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers references Sensurround in the chorus of the song \\"Small Black Flowers That Grow In The Sky\\" (\\"Want to get out, won't miss you Sensurround\\") from the 1996 album Everything Must Go. The Sensurround process is parodied in the 1979 film Kentucky Fried Movie in a sketch in which the fictional film See You Next Wednesday is screened in \\"Feel-Around\\", whereby a uniformed usher touches the viewer in time with the action on the screen, including assaulting and kissing them. In its 1981 anti- materialism song \\"Elevator Muzik\\", the Resurrection Band references the process in the lyric \\"Elevating sales at the speed of sound, soon you'll be shopping in Sensurround\\".

It is made by flavouring balls of quark (a type of soft cheese) with caraway and salt, allowing them to dry, and then leaving them in a wooden box containing rye flour and cheese mites for about three months. An enzyme in the digestive juices excreted by the mites causes the cheese to ripen. Milbenk√§se is said to taste similar to Harzer cheese, but with a bitter note (increasing with age) and a distinctive zesty aftertaste. Mites clinging to the cheese rind are consumed along with the cheese. Historically, the cheese was produced in the Zeitz and Altenburg districts of the Saxony-Anhalt / Thuringia border region; today it is produced exclusively in the village of W√ºrchwitz, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The cheese mite memorial at W√ºrchwitz The traditional method of making Milbenk√§se, which dates back to the Middle Ages, was nearly lost by 1970, with only the elderly Liesbeth Brauer knowing the technique. Local science teacher Helmut P√∂schel was taught the proper way to make it and together with his associate, Christian Schmelzer, succeeded in revitalizing the tradition. A Cheese Mite Memorial was later erected at W√ºrchwitz to celebrate the renaissance of Milbenk√§se production. Production Aged Milbenk√§se Quark flavoured with salt and caraway is shaped into small balls, cylinders or wheels, and dried. Then it is placed in a wooden box containing rye flour and inhabited by Tyrophagus casei mites for at least three months. The digestive juices of the mites diffuse into the cheese and cause fermentation; the flour is added because the mites would otherwise simply eat the whole cheese instead of just nibbling away at the crust as is desired. After one month, the cheese rind turns yellow; after three months, reddish brown. Some producers allow the cheese to ripen for up to one year, until it has turned black. Legality Milbenk√§se falls into something of a legal grey area: EU Regulation 178/2002 allows the sale of foodstuffs containing living animals if they are \\"prepared for placing on the market for human consumption\\".Article 2(b) at eur- lex.europa.eu On the other hand, cheese mites or their digestive juices are not explicitly permitted as additives for cheese according to the relevant German food ordinances (Zusatzstoff-Zulassungsverordnung and K√§severordnung). Milbenk√§se is produced under a permit by the local food safety office and HACCP compliance of the product is enforced. Similar cheeses Cheese mites are used in cheese maturing elsewhere. The most famous example is probably Mimolette from northeastern France and nearby Belgium. Other French cheeses - mainly from the Massif Central, the French Alps and the Pyrenees - sometimes host cheese mites in their crust more (e.g. old Cantal and Salers) or less (e.g. certain Tomme de Montagne varieties) by accident. But most of these cheeses are semi-hard to hard rennet cheeses, whereas Milbenk√§se is a softer sour milk cheese. The Spanish Cabrales cheese of the Asturias region also contains living cheese mites, though they are few in number, inhabit the mould canals, and take no significant part in the maturation of this blue cheese. Another cheese that contains living animals is the Sardinian casu marzu, which contains maggots of the cheese fly.
