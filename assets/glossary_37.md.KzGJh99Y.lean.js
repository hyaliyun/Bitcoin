He became a visiting Professor of Journalism at the University of Lincoln, England, and was a media commentator on the intelligence services and propaganda. Biography Born in Sydney, he began his career in 1946 as a copyboy with the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Two years as a cadet reporter with The Northern Star (Lismore) followed. He then temporarily left journalism to become a copra trader in Fiji. He next joined the Oceania Daily News (Suva), for which he wrote a social column titled Round the Town With Suzanne. The paper prided itself on being the \\"First Paper Published in the World Today\\" because of Suva's proximity to the International Dateline. Knightley returned to Australia and worked for The Herald in Melbourne interviewing newly arrived migrants at the docks. He returned to Sydney in 1952 joining the city's Daily Mirror as a crime reporter and covered Elizabeth II's visit to Australia in 1953/54. He left for London in November 1954 as foreign correspondent for the Daily Mirror, and then went to India as managing editor of the Bombay (Mumbai) literary magazine, Imprint. He learned much later that Imprint was funded by the CIA. Migrating to the UK in 1963, he became a special correspondent for The Sunday Times of London, remaining there until 1985. During this time he was a member of the 'Insight' investigative team. Over a three-year period from 1968 to 1971, Knightley prepared an investigative report about the development of thalidomide in Germany and its manufacture under licence by The Distillers Company in the UK without adequate testing. He also published an investigation into the Vestey family companies, which were structured to avoid tax. This resulted in a biography of the family titled The Rise and Fall of the House of Vestey in which he wrote that the family \\"did not live on the income; they did not live on the interest from their investments; they lived on the interest on the interest\\". After leaving The Sunday Times, he contributed literary criticism to the Mail on Sunday (London), The Independent (London), The Australian 's Review of Books, The Age (Melbourne), and the New York Review of Books. He lectured on journalism, law, and war at the Australian National Press Club in Canberra, the Australian Senate, City University, London, University of Manchester, Pennsylvania State University, University of California Los Angeles, Stanford University, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the Inner Temple, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and to the University of D√ºsseldorf. Knightley's main professional interests were war reporting, propaganda, and espionage. In more than 30 years of writing about espionage, he met most of the spy chiefs of all the major intelligence services in the world, and interviewed numerous officers and agents from all sides during the Cold War and since. In December 2010, he received media coverage for acting as a bail sureties provider for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Having backed Assange by pledging bail in December 2010, Knightley lost the money in June 2012 when a judge ordered it to be forfeited, as Assange had sought to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts by entering the embassy of Ecuador. In 1997, Knightley was a judge for Canada's Lionel Gelber Prize, which honours the world's best book on international relations. He was the European representative on the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and patron of the C. W. Bean Foundation in Canberra. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 2005, for \\"services to journalism and as an author\\". Knightley was married with two daughters, Aliya and Marisa, a son, Kim, and two granddaughters. He lived between London, Sydney and Goa in India. He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 87.

It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara.Evans, S.C.

Unlike its longer \\"winged\\" relative Kuehneosuchus (which may be a species of the same genus or represent a different sexual morph), aerodynamic studies have shown that Kuehneosaurus was probably not a glider, but instead used its elongated ribs to parachute from the trees. A study by Stein et al. in 2008 found that its parachuting speed, descending at a 45-degree angle, would be between 10 and 12 metres per second. Pitch was controlled by lappets (wattle-like flaps of skin) on the hyoid apparatus, as in the modern gliding lizard Draco.Stein, K., Palmer, C., Gill, P.G., and Benton, M.J.

That first year featured Maya Angelou, Toni Cade Bambara, Ruth Stone, Alice Walker, and Ruth Whitman. Since then, it has become the longest-running annual festival of women writers in the nation, showcasing the talents and issues addressed by established and emerging authors. UK History faculty Nancy Dye had suggested using surplus funds from Undergraduate Studies to bring women writers to campus. A 16-member committee from the departments of English, Honors, Undergraduate Studies, and Special Collections, along with members of the Lexington community, produced the conference. In 1984‚Äì1985 the conference was directed by UK English faculty Jane Gentry Vance, who later served as Kentucky's Poet Laureate. In 1985‚Äì1993, the conference was affiliated with Continuing Education for Women/University Extension and directed by Betty Gabehart. As the conference's longest-running director, Gabehart made significant contributions to its enduring legacy and stability, establishing much of the reputation it enjoys today. In 1994‚Äì1996, the conference was affiliated with the Women's Studies Program and directed by Jan Oaks, faculty in English and Gender and Women's Studies. In 1997, former Conference assistant Patti DeYoung served as director. In 1998 the conference lost university funding when it was unable to find a sponsoring department, and its advisory board established itself as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Its new home became the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning in downtown Lexington, and it was renamed the Kentucky Women Writers Conference. Its director during those years, 1998‚Äì2002, was Jan Isenhour, also director of the Carnegie Center, and its work was carried out by a volunteer board. In 2002 President Lee Todd reinstated support for the conference to demonstrate the university's commitment to women's programming and community events. Since then, the Conference leadership has continued cultivating wide community support through many partnerships and the committed efforts of its board and volunteers. UK provides staff salaries, office space, and the majority of KWWC's operating expenses. Financial support from the Kentucky Foundation for Women, LexArts, the Kentucky Arts Council, the Kentucky Humanities Council, businesses, and individual patrons remains critical to our ability to attract writers of the highest caliber. Directors since then have been Brenda Weber (2003) and Rebecca Gayle Howell (2004‚Äì06). Howell launched several free community events that have become signature offerings of the conference, including the Gypsy Slam, the Sonia Sanchez Series, and the Hardwick/Jones keynote reading on mentorship and collaboration. In 2007, Julie Kuzneski Wrinn became Conference director. The 38th annual conference will be held September 15-16, 2017 in Lexington, Kentucky.

Val Gardena (; ; ) is a valley in Northern Italy, in the Dolomites of South Tyrol. It is best known as a skiing, rock climbing, and woodcarving area. Geography The Stevia range above Val Gardena. The valley's main river is the Rio Gardena. The three municipalities in Val Gardena are Ortisei, Selva, and Santa Cristina; they were served by the Ferrovia della Val Gardena from 1916 until 1960. Culture Accidents like the one depicted were frequent among the farmers collecting timber in the woods during harsh winters in Val Gardena. Val Gardena is one of five valleys with a majority of Ladin speakers (two of these valleys are in South Tyrol). The form of the Ladin language spoken in this valley is called Gardenese in Italian, Gr√∂dnerisch in German and Gherd√´ina in Ladin.Old prints of Val Gardena Woodcarving Woodcarving in Val Gardena. Around 1900 when carving of statues of Catholic saints was at its bloom. The woodcarving industry has flourished in Val Gardena since the 17th century. Since the 19th century, statues and altars carved in the area have been shipped to Catholic Churches throughout the world. In the 18th century, besides religious statuettes, the production of woodcarved figurines of genre art was widespread in the valley. Among them statuettes of beggars generally in pairs (female and male), four seasons, watchstands were very popular. In the 19th and 20th century, carving of wooden toys was such a widespread occupation in all Gardenese families that Amelia Edwards called Ortisei the \\"capital of Toyland\\". One of the valley's best-known products is the peg wooden doll which was popular all over Europe and America in the 19th century. In one of her many trips Margaret Warner Morley went to Europe to Val Gardena where she was inspired to write the novel Donkey John of the toy valley. The Parish Church of Ortisei displays a rich collection of statues carved by local artists in the last two centuries. The Museo della Val Gardena in Ortisei owns a rich collection of historical wooden toys, and woodcarved statues and figurines. Sports Carved gallant genre scene in Swiss Pine with figurines from Val Gardena 18th century. Skiing The valley hosted the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 1970. Val Gardena is home to the Saslong Classic, a men's World Cup downhill race that has been held almost every year since 1969. Since 2002 (and in 1983), the downhill has been paired with a Super-G race, and from 1979 to 1982 a combined event was held. The Saslong course is considered one of the five \\"classic\\" men's downhill races, along with Garmisch-Partenkirchen's Kandahar (GER), Kitzb√ºhel's Hahnenkamm (AUT), Wengen's Lauberhorn (SUI), and Val-d'Is√®re's Criterium (FRA). It is well known for the \\"Camel Humps\\" (or \\"Bumps\\"), a series of three small jumps which racers must negotiate in quick succession. Two men have won the Saslong title four times in a career: Austrian Franz Klammer (1975, two races in 1976, and 1982) and Italy's Kristian Ghedina (1996, 1998, 1999, and 2001). If Super-G wins are also included, two other men have matched that feat: Peter M√ºller of Switzerland and Austrian Michael Walchhofer. A women's slalom and parallel slalom were also held in 1975. Val Gardena is part of the Sella Ronda alpine ski touring circuit. Other sports The Gardena Spring Trophy is an annual international figure skating competition held every spring in the Valley.

Abdullah bin Sulaiman Al Rajhi is the bank's Chairman of the Board of Directors and Stefano Bertamini is CEO. The board of directors has eleven directors, four are Al Rajhi family members: Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Rajhi, Sulaiman bin Saleh Al Rajhi Abdullah bin Sulaiman Al Rajhi Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Bader bin Mohammed Al Rajhi. In September 2016, Al Rajhi became the first bank in Saudi Arabia to partner with the Ministry of Housing, participating in the government's plans to increase home ownership by offering mortgages funded in part by the state. Traditionally, the bank had focused on consumer banking, but had begun diversifying its revenues with plans to adjust focus towards mid-corporate and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) business as the Saudi government implemented its broader social reform agenda and the National Transformation Programme (NTP). As of 2016, 70 percent of Al Rajhi's assets and 55 to 60 percent of its revenue were generated from consumer banking, and the bank has an 18 percent share of the mortgage market in the Kingdom.  Controversy  Al Rajhi Bank faced allegations in multiple U.S. lawsuits following the attacks on September 11, 2001, including claims that Al Rajhi Bank was used to complete financial transactions for people or nonprofit organizations with terrorist ties. Al Rajhi-related nonprofit and business ventures located in Virginia were subjected to searches and seizures by U.S. law officials trying to disrupt terrorist financing activities in the United States in 2002.\\"U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money Laundering, Drugs, and Terrorist Financing: HSBC Case History\\". Committee hearing. United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Permanent Subcommittee On Investigations. Video. 2012-07-17. Retrieved 2016-04-28. In January 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed all claims against the Bank. The Court held: \\"Plaintiffs do not offer facts to support their conclusions that Al Rajhi Bank had to know that Defendant charities . . . were supporting . . . terrorism. . . . Even accepting all the allegations against Al Rajhi Bank as true, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that would entitle them to relief.\\" Despite these allegations, on June 30, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order leaving intact the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against the bank, as well as Sulaiman bin Abdulaziz Al Rajhi (the bank's founder and former chairman) and Abdullah bin Suleiman Al Rajhi (the bank's chairman and former CEO) among others, related to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Supreme Court's order brought a final close to claims asserted against the bank and its officers by victims and survivors of the 9/11 attacks. In March 2002, as part of Operation Green Quest, a covert U.S. Treasury attempt to disrupt terrorist financing in the United States, U.S. law enforcement agents entered and searched 14 interwoven business and nonprofits in Virginia that were associated with the SAAR Foundation, a private charitable foundation established in 1983 that Sulaiman bin Abdulaziz Al Rajhi and two other Al Rajhi family members were on its initial board of directors. A law enforcement affidavit stated that over 100 nonprofit and businesses in Virginia were a part of the ‚ÄúSafa Group,‚Äù which were believed to be ‚Äúengaged in the money laundering tactic of ‚Äòlayering‚Äô to hide from law enforcement authorities the trail of its support for terrorists.‚Äù Subsequent 2006 federal grand jury subpoenas showed Al Rajhi Bank was not directly related to the entities subject to the March 2002 search. The decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit cited by the Staff Report in this regard indicated those matters involved counsel that has never represented either the bank or members of the Al Rajhi family. The Al Rajhi name was identified on a file that displayed a handwritten list of 20 people listed as alleged key financial backers of al Qaeda. The list, an image of a scanned document on a CD-ROM, was found during a search of the Bosnian offices of the Benevolence International Foundation, a Saudi-based nonprofit later designated a terrorist organization by the Treasury Department. The Golden Chain was discussed in the 9/11 Commission's report, in Federal court filings, and civil lawsuits, though the Al Rajhi name was not specifically mentioned, while media reports as early as 2004 claim that the al Qaeda list included the Al Rajhi name. In 2003, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) released a classified document entitled, ‚ÄúAl Rajhi Bank: Conduit for Extremist Finance.‚Äù According to Glenn Simpson of the Wall Street Journal, the CIA report ended with: ‚ÄúSenior Al Rajhi family members have long supported Islamic extremists and probably know that terrorists use their bank.‚Äù The 2003 CIA report stated that in 2000, Al Rajhi Bank couriers ‚Äúdelivered money to the Indonesian insurgent group Kompak to fund weapons purchases and bomb-making activities.‚Äù Al Rajhi Bank filed a defamation lawsuit in 2004 against the Wall Street Journal for a 2002 article that wrote about how Saudi Arabia was monitoring several accounts because of terrorist worries. The lawsuit settled in 2004 and the Wall Street Journal was not required to pay damages. The WSJ also published a letter from the bank's chief executive, and its own statement that the newspaper \\"did not intend to imply an allegation that [Al Rajhi Bank] supported terrorist activity, or had engaged in the financing of terrorism.\\" Three of the hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attack, including Abdulaziz al Omari, reportedly used banking services through Al Rajhi Bank. Without violating applicable bank secrecy laws, the bank cannot confirm or deny this allegation. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States found that the hijackers had accounts with and moved hundreds of thousands of dollars through many banks, including mainstream U.S. banks, but \\"[c]ontrary to persistent media reports, no financial institution filed a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) in connection with any transaction of any of the 19 hijackers before 9/11 ....\\" This, however, ‚Äúwas not unreasonable‚Äù in the Commission's view because, ‚Äú[e]ven in hindsight, there is nothing ... to indicate that any SAR should have been filed or the hijackers otherwise reported to law enforcement.‚Äù In response to these allegations Al Rajhi Bank continues to condemn terrorism and deny any part in financing terrorists.

Known as Harford Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 40 Truck in Baltimore north to US 1 and US 1 Business in Benson. MD 147 is an alternate route to US 1 between Baltimore and Bel Air, the county seat of Harford County. The state highway is the main street of several neighborhoods in Northeast Baltimore and the Baltimore County suburbs of Parkville and Carney. MD 147 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore and Harford counties and by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation within the city. Harford Road was a pair of turnpikes before the Baltimore-Carney portion of the highway was designated one of the original state roads. The Baltimore County section of MD 147 was constructed in the early 1910s and widened multiple times in the late 1920s and 1930s. The section of the state highway in Harford County was built in the late 1920s. Route description View south along MD 147 near Kingsville MD 147 begins at an intersection with US 1 and US 40 Truck (North Avenue) in Baltimore. The south leg of the intersection is one-way northbound Harford Avenue; southbound Harford Avenue toward Downtown Baltimore is accessed via southbound Aisquith a few blocks to the west. MD 147 heads northeast from US 1 as a five-lane undivided road (three lanes northbound and two lanes southbound) that crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. Upon crossing 25th Street, the state highway widens to a six-lane divided street, passing west of Achievement Academy at Harbor City High School and along the western edge of Clifton Park. As it does so, it meets the southern ends of MD 542 (The Alameda) and MD 41 (Hillen Road). Within the Mayfield neighborhood, MD 147 narrows to four lanes undivided and passes by Lake Montebello and through Herring Run Park, where the highway crosses the namesake stream. Beyond Argonne/Parkside Drive, the state highway dualizes once again and gains a northbound parking lane, with one southbound lane doubling as a parking lane, as it then passes through Lauraville, where the highway intersects Cold Spring Lane and Moravia Road. Becoming undivided once again, MD 147 widens to accommodate two full-time parking lanes at Echodale Avenue before intersecting the southern end of Old Harford Road and then Northern Parkway in Hamilton. Upon entering Baltimore County, the parking lanes close, and MD 147 continues as the main street of Parkville, narrowing further to two traffic lanes and two bike lanes just north of Taylor Avenue. The state highway widens once again to four lanes just before Putty Hill Avenue and meets Interstate 695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a cloverleaf interchange. Outside of the Beltway, MD 147 gains a center left- turn lane through its intersection with Joppa Road in Carney, north of which the road reduces to two lanes. North of Cub Hill Road in the community of Cub Hill, the state highway exits the suburban area and enters Gunpowder Falls State Park. MD 147 makes a curvaceous descent into the Gunpowder Falls valley and, after crossing a bridge and making a sharp curve to the southeast, parallels Gunpowder Falls for a short distance before turning northeast again and away from the stream. After a curvaceous ascent from the river valley, the roadway straightens out to pass through farmland with scattered subdivisions. MD 147 crosses Long Green Creek and has a sharp S-curve around a hill before intersecting Glen Arm Road/Mt. Vista Road at a roundabout. The state highway continues through the community of Fork, at the center of which the highway meets Fork Road and Sunshine Avenue. East of Fork, MD 147 descends into the valley of Little Gunpowder Falls, which forms the Baltimore-Harford county line. The state highway continues northeast and crosses Rocky Branch before its intersection with MD 152 (Fallston Road). MD 147 heads into the community of Benson, the site of its northern terminus at a four-way intersection with US 1 and US 1 Business. US 1 heads north as the Bel Air Bypass and south as Belair Road, while US 1 Business heads east on Belair Road into the town of Bel Air. MD 147 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from US 1 in Baltimore to Joppa Road in Carney. History MD 147's predecessor routes included parts of Old Harford Road in the late 18th century and a pair of turnpikes in the 19th century. The Baltimore and Harford Turnpike ran from Baltimore to the county line at Little Gunpowder Falls, and the Harford Turnpike went from there to the Baltimore and Bel Air Turnpike at the spot west of Bel Air that became the community of Benson. The portion of Harford Road from North Avenue in Baltimore to Cub Hill was designated one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The proposed state road continued along what are today a series of county routes: Cub Hill Road, Glen Arm Road, and Manor Road to its intersection with Long Green Road in the community of Unionville or Long Green. Harford Road was under construction by 1911 from North Avenue to Taylor Avenue and completed in 1912. From North Avenue to the old city limits near Lake Montebello, Harford Road was reconstructed with a vitrified brick surface. From the city limits to Taylor Avenue, the highway was built with a wide tarred macadam surface. The old turnpike along what is now Harford Road was resurfaced from Taylor Avenue northeast to Little Gunpowder Falls by 1915. The Harford County portion of Harford Road was reconstructed starting in 1926. The highway was completed as a macadam road from US 1 in Benson west to Rocky Branch in 1927. The remainder of Harford Road south to Little Gunpowder Falls was built as a concrete road in 1928. By 1930, the portion of Harford Road in Baltimore city and county was widened to a width of . Harford Road was marked as MD 147 by 1933. Between 1936 and 1938, the tracks of a defunct interurban were removed and the space used to widen MD 147 to a width of from the Baltimore city line to Carney. That portion of MD 147 was widened again with the addition of a wide concrete shoulder around 1940. In 2018, a roundabout was constructed at Glen Arm Road/Mt. Vista Road.

It opened in 1985 as Trump's Castle.Michael Lev, \\"Company News; Hilton Plans to Seek Atlantic City License\\", The New York Times, January 30, 1991. In 1988, the casino became one of the settings for the game show version of Yahtzee, and in 1990 it was the setting for the game show Trump Card. Revenues at Trump Castle took a sharp decline in 1990 due to competition from its newly opened sister property, Trump Taj Mahal, as well as broader economic factors such as the Gulf War and the early 1990s recession. A payment to bondholders was made in December 1990 only with the help of a $3.5 million purchase of casino chips by Trump's father, Fred Trump, which was later determined to be an illegal loan, for which the casino paid a fine of $30,000. Unable to make its next payment on $338 million in bonds, the Castle began debt restructuring negotiations in May 1991. Hilton offered to repurchase the property for $165 million, which Trump rejected. A deal was ultimately reached to give the bondholders 50 percent ownership of the Castle, in exchange for reduced interest rates and forgiveness of $25 million of debt. The plan was filed as a prepackaged bankruptcy in March 1992. Trump reacquired full ownership of the Castle in a refinancing deal in December 1993. He then sold the property in September 1996 to his new publicly traded casino company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, for $130 million in stock plus $355 million in assumed debt. Trump then began negotiations to sell a 50 percent stake in the property to the Rank Organization for $325 million and convert it into a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Discussions fizzled in December 1996, and Trump said he would look for a new theme, saying he \\"never liked the castle theme.\\" Trump next announced an agreement to sell a 51 percent stake in the Castle to Colony Capital for $125 million, which would be used to construct a new hotel tower and re-theme the property as Trump Marina. The sale and expansion were canceled, however, in March 1997. Trump Marina (1997‚Äì2011) The Castle was renamed Trump Marina in June 1997. Trump Entertainment Resorts agreed in May 2008 to sell Trump Marina for $316 million to New York-based Coastal Development, who planned to rebrand the property as a Margaritaville casino in partnership with singer Jimmy Buffett. Despite a later price reduction to $270 million, Coastal was unable to find financing, and the agreement was terminated in June 2009. Negotiations continued while Atlantic City casino values plunged, with Coastal offering $75 million for the property in February 2010, but no deal was reached. Bondholders who had taken over Trump Entertainment Resorts after its 2009 bankruptcy remained eager to sell Trump Marina and focus on the company's two other casinos.

Dock contents can be organized into tabs and paying the shareware fee enables the user to assign a keyboard shortcut to any dock item. DragThing has won many awards, and in 2010 MacWorld gave it 4.5 mice, highlighting its utility for users who preferred using the mouse over keyboard-oriented launchers such as LaunchBar or QuickSilver. History In its early versions, DragThing brought many features useful in a multitasking environment to Classic Mac OS such as alt-tab application switching and an onscreen representation of running processes. These features were not implemented by Apple until Mac OS 8.5. DragThing was one of the first applications to adopt the Platinum appearance on Mac OS 8 and ran in the Blue Box on Apple's aborted Rhapsody project. The DragThing release schedule slowed between 1998 and 2000, as its developer James Thomson was then employed at Apple Inc as part of the team working on Mac OS X's Finder and Dock. He surmised that the built-in Dock of OS X would soon make DragThing obsolete. Thomson left Apple shortly after Mac OS X was released and resumed work on DragThing, releasing version 4.0 on 24 March 2001, skipping version 3. None of Thomson's code survives in the current shipping version of Apple's Dock. DragThing was first released on 1 May 1995 and celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2005. It was praised in a 2004 article by Bruce Tognazzini, who said \\"...if I could have taken all the lessons learned in Systems 1 through 9 and applied them to System X, I certainly wouldn't have ended up with the Dock. No, I would have ended up with DragThing...\\" In late 2018, the software developer warned of probable end-of- life.

This preserves the detail of the surface pattern. While historical molds show that springerle were baked for religious holidays and secular occasions throughout the year, they are now most commonly associated with the Christmas season. The name springerle translates literally as \\"little jumper\\" or \\"little knight\\", but its exact origin is unknown. It may refer the popular motif of a jumping horse in the mold, or just to the rising or \\"springing up\\" of the dough as it bakes. The origin of the cookie can be traced back to at least the 14th century in southwestern Germany and surrounding areas, mostly in Swabia. Baking process Image:Springerle raw before 24h drying.jpgRaw springerle dough, just out of the wooden wedding-carriage mold (shown below). Image:Springerle ready baken.jpgSpringerle dough after drying for a day. Image:Springerle with typical foot swabian Fuessle.jpgBaked springerle, showing typical \\"foot\\". The major ingredients of springerle are eggs, white (wheat) flour, and very fine or powdered sugar. The biscuits are traditionally anise-flavored, although the anise is not usually mixed into the dough; instead it is dusted onto the baking sheets so that the biscuit sits on top of the crushed anise seeds. Traditional springerle recipes use hartshorn salt (ammonium carbonate, or baker's ammonia) as a leavening agent. Since hartshorn salt can be difficult to find, many modern recipes use baking powder as the leavening agent. Springerle made with hartshorn salt are lighter and softer than those made with baking powder. The hartshorn salt also imparts a crisper design and longer shelf-life to the springerle. The leavening causes the biscuit to at least double in height during baking. To make springerle, very cold, stiff dough is rolled thin and pressed into a mold, or impressed by a specialized, carved rolling pin. The dough is unmolded and then left to dry for about 24 hours before being baked at a low temperature on greased, anise- dusted baking sheets. The drying period allows time for the pattern in the top of the cookie to set, so that the cookie has a \\"pop-up\\" effect from leavening, producing the characteristic \\"foot\\" along the edges, below the molded surface. A modern Springerle rolling pin The baked biscuits are hard, and are packed away to ripen for two or four weeks. During this time, they become tender. Another method of making springerle is to not chill the dough at all. Commonly, after mixing all the ingredients together, one would cover a surface with flour, and use a regular rolling pin (also covered in flour) to roll out the dough to about half-an-inch of thickness. Flour would be spread over the top surface of the rolled-out dough, and also on the specialized Springerle rolling pin. One would whack the Springerle rolling pin against one's hand a few times, to dislodge any flour caked into the designs on it, and then proceed to carefully but firmly roll out the molds. One uses a knife to cut out the small, rectangular cookies (often 2x1 inches), and place them on a wooden board to dry overnight (or for at least twelve hours). As this process is repeated, the dough gets more brittle due to the added flour and doesn't hold the molds as well. Therefore, it is important to roll the dough out in small batches (instead of all at once), to keep the moisture in so the cookies hold together. Anise seed is sprinkled on the baking sheets just before putting them in the oven (about ten minutes is usually sufficient, but the cooking time also depends on thickness). 1-2 teaspoons of anise extract can also be added to the dough to increase the taste (which is rather like licorice), and the amount of cookies varies on the thickness. The usual recipe with 4 eggs and 3-4 cups of flour can yield anywhere from 60-144 cookies, depending on thickness and the experience of the maker. Molds Molds are traditionally carved from wood, although plastic and pottery molds are also available. Pear wood is prized for its density and durability. Older handmade molds are folk art, are typically unsigned, and undated. The stamping technique may be derived from the molds used in some Christian traditions to mark sacramental bread, and the earliest molds featured religious motifs, including scenes from Bible stories and Christian symbols. Later, in the 17th and 18th century, heraldic themes of knights and fashionably dressed ladies became popular. Themes of happiness, love, weddings, and fertility remained popular through the 19th century.

The mission is part of NASA's Small Explorer program and was launched with a Pegasus-XL rocket on October 19, 2008. The mission is led by Dr. David J. McComas (IBEX Principal Investigator), formerly of the Southwest Research Institute and now with Princeton University. The Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center built the IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo sensors respectively. The Orbital Sciences Corporation manufactured the spacecraft bus and was the location for spacecraft environmental testing. The nominal mission baseline duration was two years after commissioning, and the prime ended in early 2011. The spacecraft and sensors are still healthy and the mission is continuing in its extended mission. IBEX is in a Sun-oriented spin-stabilized orbit around the Earth. In June 2011, IBEX was shifted to a new, more efficient, much more stable orbit. It does not come as close to the Moon in the new orbit, and expends less fuel to maintain its position.  Science Goal  The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission science goal is to discover the nature of the interactions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium at the edge of our solar system. IBEX has achieved this goal by generating full sky maps of the intensity (integrated over the line- of-sight) of ENAs in a range of energies every six months. Most of these ENAs are generated in the heliosheath, which is the region of interaction.  Mission = Launch  The IBEX satellite was mated to its Pegasus XL rocket at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and the combined vehicle was then suspended below the Lockheed L-1011 Stargazer mother airplane and flown to Kwajalein Atoll in the Central Pacific Ocean. Stargazer arrived at Kwajalein on Sunday, October 12, 2008. The IBEX satellite was carried into space on October 19, 2008, by the Pegasus XL rocket. The rocket was released from Stargazer, which took off from Kwajalein, at 17:47:23 UTC. By launching from this site close to the Equator, the Pegasus rocket lifted as much as more mass to orbit than it would have with a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  Mission profile  The IBEX satellite, initially launched into a highly-elliptical transfer orbit with a low perigee, used a solid fuel rocket motor as its final boost stage at apogee, in order to raise its perigee greatly and to achieve its desired high-altitude elliptical orbit. IBEX is in a highly-eccentric elliptical terrestrial orbit, which ranges from a perigee of about to an apogee of about . Its original orbit was about ‚Äîthat is, about 80% of the distance to the Moon‚Äîwhich has changed primarily due to an intentional adjustment to prolong the spacecraft's useful life (see Orbit adjusted below). This very high orbit allows the IBEX satellite to move out of the Earth's magnetosphere when making scientific observations. This extreme altitude is critical due to the amount of charged-particle interference that would occur while taking measurements within the magnetosphere. When within the magnetosphere of the Earth (), the satellite also performs other functions, including telemetry downlinks.  Orbit adjusted  In June 2011 IBEX shifted to a new orbit that raised its perigee to more than . The new orbit has a period of one third of a lunar month, which, with the correct phasing, avoids taking the spacecraft too close to the Moon, whose gravity can negatively affect IBEX's orbit. Now the spacecraft uses less fuel to maintain a stable orbit, increasing its useful lifespan to more than 40 years.  Instruments  IBEX Lo sensor The heliospheric boundary of the Solar System is being imaged by measuring the location and magnitude of charge-exchange collisions occurring in all directions. The satellite's payload consists of two energetic neutral atom (ENA) imagers, IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo. Each consists of a collimator that limits their fields-of-view, a conversion surface to convert neutral hydrogen and oxygen into ions, an electrostatic analyzer (ESA) to suppress ultraviolet light and to select ions of a specific energy range, and a detector to count particles and identify the type of each ion. Both of these sensors are a single-pixel camera with a field-of-view of roughly 7¬∞ x 7¬∞. The IBEX-Hi instrument is recording particle counts in a higher energy band (300 eV to 6 keV) than the IBEX-Lo energy band (10 eV to 2 keV). The scientific payload also includes a Combined Electronics Unit (CEU) that controls the voltages on the collimator and the ESA, and it reads and records data from the particle detectors of each sensor.  Communication  Compared to other space observatories, IBEX has a low data transfer rate due to the limited requirements of the mission. .  Data collection  High- energy map of the heliosphere The ribbon of ENA emissions seen in the IBEX map IBEX is collecting energetic neutral atom (ENA) emissions that are traveling through the Solar System to Earth that cannot be measured by conventional telescopes. These ENAs are created on the boundary of our Solar System by the interactions between solar wind particles and interstellar medium particles. On the average IBEX-Hi detects about 500 particles per day, and IBEX-Lo, less than 100. By 2012, over 100 scientific papers related to IBEX were published, described by the PI as \\"an incredible scientific harvest\\".  Data Availability  As the IBEX data is validated, the IBEX data is made available in a series of data releases on the SWRI IBEX Public Data website (see External Links below). In addition, the data is periodically sent to the NASA Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF), which is the official archive site for IBEX data. SPDF data can be searched at the Heliophysics Data Portal (see External Links below).  Science results  Animation illustrating IBEX's collection of data on neutral atoms at the boundary of the Solar System. Initial data revealed a previously unpredicted \\"very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky\\". Initial interpretations suggest that \\"the interstellar environment has far more influence on structuring the heliosphere than anyone previously believed\\". It is unknown what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon. The Sun is currently traveling through the Local Interstellar Cloud, and the heliosphere's size and shape are key factors in determining its shielding power from cosmic rays. Should IBEX detect changes in the shape of the ribbon, that could show how the heliosphere is interacting with the Local Fluff. It has also observed ENAs from the Earth's magnetosphere. In October 2010, significant changes were detected in the ribbon after six months, based on the second set of IBEX observations. It went on to detect neutral atoms from outside the Solar System, which were found to differ in composition from the Sun. Surprisingly, IBEX discovered that the heliosphere has no bow shock, and it measured its speed relative to the local interstellar medium (LISM) as , improving on the previous measurement of by Ulysses. Those speeds equate to 25% less pressure on the Sun's heliosphere than previously thought. In July 2013, IBEX results revealed a 4-lobed tail on the Solar System's heliosphere.

The raiders The raiders were members of revolutionary Indian Republican Army, who favoured armed uprisings as a means to achieve India's independence from British colonial rule. They were inspired by the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland and led by Surya Sen. However, they were ideologically influenced more by the Communists in Soviet Russia. Many of these raiders later became Communists. The group included Ganesh Ghosh, Lokenath Bal, Ambika Chakrobarty, Harigopal Bal (Tegra), Ananta Singh, Anand Prasad Gupta, Tripura Sen, Bilash Dey, Bidhubhusan Bhattacharya, Pritilata Waddedar, Kalpana Dutta, Himangshu Sen, Binod Bihari Chowdhury, Subodh Roy, Monoranjan Bhattacharya. The plan Sen devised a plan to capture the two main armouries in Chittagong, destroy the telegraph and telephone office, and take as hostages members of the European Club, the majority of whom also to be raided, while rail and communication lines were to be cut in order to sever Chittagong from Calcutta. Imperial banks at Chittagong were to be looted to gather money for further uprisings, and various jailed revolutionaries would be freed. The raid The plan was put into action at 10 p.m. on 18 April 1930. The police armoury (in Police Line in Dampara) was captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh, while another group of ten men led by Lokenath Bal took the Auxiliary Forces armoury (now the old Circuit House). Some 65 people took part in the raid, undertaken in the name of Indian Republican Army, Chittagong Branch. They failed to locate ammunition but did succeed in cutting telephone and telegraph wires and disrupting train movements. About 16 of the group captured the European club's headquarters (in Pahartali, now the Railway Office next to Shahjahan Field) but there were few club members present because of it being Good Friday. Upon learning of the situation, the Europeans were able to get the alarm out to troops, which the revolutionaries had not expected. After the raids, the revolutionaries gathered outside the police armoury, where Sen took a military salute, hoisted a national flag, and proclaimed a Provisional Revolutionary Government. The revolutionaries left Chittagong town before dawn and marched towards the Chittagong hill ranges, looking for a safe place to hide. A few of the members including Ganesh Ghosh, Ananta Singh and the teenagers Ananda Gupta and Jeebon Ghoshal were elsewhere, and almost captured at Feni railway station but managed to escape. Later they stayed in hiding in a house in Chandannagar. Aftermath After a few days, the police traced some of the revolutionaries. They were surrounded by several thousand troops while they took shelter in Jalalabad hills near Chittagong Cantonment on the afternoon of 22 April 1930. Over 80 troops and 12 revolutionaries were killed in the ensuing gunfight in the Battle of Jalalabad Hills. Sen dispersed his men to neighbouring villages in small groups and thus some escaped. A few fled to Calcutta while some were arrested. An intense crackdown on the resistance ensued. Ananta Singh gave himself up in Calcutta coming away from his hiding place in Chandannagar, to be close to the young teenagers captured and under trial in Chittagong. A few months later, Police Commissioner Charles Tegart surrounded their hideout and in the ensuing exchange of fire, Jiban Ghoshal was killed. Some of the revolutionaries managed to reorganise. On 24 September 1932, Debi Prasad Gupta, Manoranjan Sen, Rajat Sen, Swadesh Roy, Phanindra Nandi and Subodh Chaudhary led by Pritilata Waddedar, attacked the Pahartali European Club, killing one woman and injuring several police officials. However, the plan was not entirely successful. The revolutionaries fled after the attack, but Pritilata, who got wounded, consumed cyanide to evade arrest and killed herself. The police searched the rest of the absconders. In Kalarpole encounter Deba Gupta, Manoranjan Sen, Rajat Sen and Swadeshranjan Ray were killed while the other two, Subodh and Phani, were wounded and arrested. During 1930‚Äì1932, 22 officials and 220 others were killed by revolutionaries in separate incidents. Debi Prasad Gupta's brother was sentenced to transportation for life. The armoury raid trial The mass trial of those arrested during and after the raids concluded in January 1932 and the judgement was delivered on 1 March 1932. Twelve of the defendants were sentenced to deportation for life, two received three-year prison sentences and the remaining 32 individuals were acquitted. The twelve deported to Andaman included Ganesh Ghosh, Lokenath Bal, sixteen-year-old Ananda Gupta, and Ananta Singh. Capture and death of Surya Sen The Chittagong revolutionary group suffered a fatal blow when Masterda Surya Sen was arrested on 16 February 1933 from Gairala village after a tip-off from an insider of the group. For the reward money, jealousy, or both, Netra Sen told the British Government that Surya Sen was at his house. But before Netra Sen was able to get his 10,000 rupee reward, he was assassinated by the revolutionaries. Surya Sen along with Tarakeswar Dastidar were hanged by the British Administration on 12 January 1934 after inhuman torture in prison. Film adaptations A Bengali movie Chattagram Astragar Lunthan was made on the Chittagong armoury raid in 1949. It was directed by Nirmal Chowdhury. A Hindi movie, Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey was made on the Chittagong armoury raid in 2010. It was directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar starring Abhishek Bachchan and supported by Deepika Padukone. It was based on the book Do and Die: The Chittagong Uprising 1930-34 by Manini Chatterjee. Another film, Chittagong was made in 2010 and released in October 2012. It was directed by Dr. Bedabrata Pain, a former scientist in NASA who resigned from NASA to make this film. Manoj Bajpai was the lead actor and played the role of Surya Sen.

It is bounded by the Leeds Inner Ring Road in the east and north and the Leeds ‚Äì York / Hull railway in the south. The area falls within the City and Hunslet ward of Leeds City Council.  History  Quarry Hill was originally an inner-city area of Leeds. Three churches have historically been located on Quarry Hill. The Old Boggart House was the first purpose built Methodist chapel in Leeds. It was demolished following the opening of the adjacent St Peter's Chapel in 1834. The site is marked by a blue plaque on the steps leading to the Leeds Playhouse. Leeds Methodist Pioneers Plaque Quarry Hill Ebenezer Primitive Methodist chapel, originally called \\"Chapel Street Chapel\\", was opened in 1822, new frontage was added in 1846 and the chapel was enlarged in 1874. It closed in 1933. St Mary's Church, a Commissioners' Church, architect Thomas Taylor, was located on St Mary's Street. Located on the top of the hill, looking over New York Road towards the city centre, and known both as \\"St. Mary's Mabgate\\" and \\"St. Mary's Quarry Hill\\", the site is now a Diocesan Office. The Sunday school remains, as does the burial ground, a green area sloping down to Mabgate. A past resident of the Quarry Hill area was Mary Fitzpatrick, a robber and suspected murderer. Between 1938 and 1978 Quarry Hill was the location of what was at the time the largest social housing complex in the United Kingdom. The building was designed in 1934 by R. A. H. Livett (1898‚Äì1959), the Director of Housing and later City Architect for Leeds. Its design was influenced strongly by modernist developments in Europe, specifically the Karl-Marx-Hof in Vienna, Austria, and La Cit√© de la Muette in Paris, France. The development was noted for its sheer size and modernist design. It had then radical and modern features such as solid fuel ranges, electric lighting, a state-of-the-art refuse disposal system (Garchey) and communal facilities including a swimming pool. Due to social problems and poor maintenance, the Quarry Hill Flats were demolished in 1978.  Current  Since the 1980s, Quarry Hill has been a focus for regeneration within Leeds, and today is home to the West Yorkshire Playhouse, now known as Leeds Playhouse, which opened in 1990, Yorkshire Dance, established in 1982, Quarry House (a Department of Health and Department for Work and Pensions building with a social/leisure complex, which opened in 1993), the BBC Yorkshire building, the Leeds Conservatoire (formerly Leeds College of Music) Leeds Conservatoire, accessed 14 October 2020 and the Northern Ballet building which opened in 2010. Centenary Square and the Playhouse Square are located at Quarry Hill. The regeneration has seen Quarry Hill become disassociated with East Leeds, and become part of central Leeds. Quarry House was constructed on the site of the former Quarry Hill Flats. Leeds City College built a creative arts and health, care and public services campus, designed by Ellis Williams Architects, on the north-west of the site, which opened in September 2019. Part of the college building is used by Leeds Conservatoire.  In the media  *The flats were shown in the opening sequence of the popular 1970s sit-com Queenie's Castle (1970‚Äì72) which starred Diana Dors. *Featured in the Peter May novel Runaway, with scenes set in the housing project in 1965 and in its later transformation circa 2015. *Quarry Hill also features in Charles Stross's 2016 novel The Nightmare Stacks. *The complete Quarry Hill development in architects model form can be seen in the 1935 film Housing Problems, a key work of the Documentary Film Movement which is also featured as an extra on BBC DVD release of the influential 1966 TV play Cathy Come Home.

It is known from a single fossil and is the only glider with a membrane surrounding the pelvis instead of the pectoral girdle. This lizard-like reptile was found in 1965 in the Madygen Formation, Dzailauchou, on the southwest edge of the Fergana valley in Kyrgyzstan, in what was then the Asian part of the U.S.S.R. dating to the middle-late Triassic period (about 225 million years ago). The Madygen horizon displays flora that put it in the Upper Triassic. An unusual reptile, Longisquama, was also found there. S. mirabilis is known from a unique holotype specimen, which was first described by Aleksandr Grigorevich Sharov in 1971.Sharov, A. G. 1971. New flying reptiles from the Mesozoic of Kazakhstan and Kirghizia. ‚Äì Transactions of the Paleontological Institute, Akademia Nauk, USSR, Moscow, 130: 104‚Äì113 [in Russian]. Sharov named the species Podopteryx mirabilis, \\"foot wing\\", for the wing membranes on the hind limbs. However, that name had previously been used for a genus of damselfly, Podopteryx, so in 1981 Richard Cowen created the new genus name Sharovipteryx for the species. Description Restoration The skeleton is preserved in dorsal view and largely complete, with the bones still articulated and impressions of some of the integument. But part of the pectoral girdle is missing and part is still encased in stone. In 1987, Gans et al. published a revised description: they found that the patagium did not extend to the forelimbs. Their experiments with models showed that the reptile could glide with its uropatagium and stabilize its glide by changing the angles of its forelimbs to provide an aeronautic canard or by bending its tail up or down to produce drag. In 2006, Dyke et al. published a study on possible gliding techniques for Sharovipteryx. The authors found that the wing membrane, which stretched between its very long hind legs and tail, would have allowed it to glide as a delta wing aircraft does. If the tiny front limbs also supported a membrane, they could have acted as a very efficient means of controlling pitch stability, very much like an aeronautic canard. Without a forewing, the authors find, controlled gliding would have been very difficult. Together with the canards on the forelimbs, these anterior membranes may have formed excellent control surfaces for gliding. The area around the forelimbs was completely prepared away in the only known fossil, destroying any possible trace of a membrane there. Classification Holotype in different lighting Sharovipteryx is generally agreed to belong to a group of early archosaur relatives known as the protorosaurs (or prolacertiformes).Philip James Senter (2003). \\"Taxon sampling artifacts and the phylogenetic position of Aves\\". .

The NHC official forecast is light blue, while the storm's actual track is the white line over Florida. A tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast aspects of the future state of tropical cyclones. There are three types of models: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic. Ddual forecast model. Both consensus and superensemble forecasts can use the guidance of global and regional models runs to improve the performance more than any of their respective components. Techniques used at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center indicate that superensemble forecasts are a very powerful tool for track forecasting. Statistical guidance r-CLIPER for Hurricane Isabel (2003) The first statistical guidance used by the National Hurricane Center was the Hurricane Analog Technique (HURRAN), which was available in 1969. It used the newly developed North Atlantic tropical cyclone database to find storms with similar tracks. It then shifted their tracks through the storm's current path, and used location, direction and speed of motion, and the date to find suitable analogs. The method did well with storms south of the 25th parallel which had not yet turned northward, but poorly with systems near or after recurvature. Since 1972, the Climatology and Persistence (CLIPER) statistical model has been used to help generate tropical cyclone track forecasts. In the era of skillful dynamical forecasts, CLIPER is now being used as the baseline to show model and forecaster skill. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Forecast (SHIFOR) has been used since 1979 for tropical cyclone intensity forecasting. It uses climatology and persistence to predict future intensity, including the current Julian day, current cyclone intensity, the cyclone's intensity 12 hours ago, the storm's initial latitude and longitude, as well as its zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) components of motion. A series of statistical-dynamical models, which used regression equations based upon CLIPER output and the latest output from primitive equation models run at the National Meteorological Center, then National Centers for Environmental Prediction, were developed between the 1970s and 1990s and were named NHC73, NHC83, NHC90, NHC91, and NHC98. Within the field of tropical cyclone track forecasting, despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power, it was not until the decade of the 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill, and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models. In 1994, a version of SHIFOR was created for the northwest Pacific Ocean for typhoon forecasting, known as the Statistical Typhoon Intensity Forecast (STIFOR), which used the 1971‚Äì1990 data for that region to develop intensity forecasts out to 72 hours into the future. In regards to intensity forecasting, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) utilizes relationships between environmental conditions from the Global Forecast System (GFS) such as vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures, climatology, and persistence (storm behavior) via multiple regression techniques to come up with an intensity forecast for systems in the northern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific oceans. A similar model was developed for the northwest Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere known as the Statistical Intensity Prediction System (STIPS), which accounts for land interactions through the input environmental conditions from the Navy Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS) model. The version of SHIPS with an inland decay component is known as Decay SHIPS (DSHIPS). The Logistic Growth Equation Model (LGEM) uses the same input as SHIPS but within a simplified dynamical prediction system. Within tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting, the Rainfall Climatology and Persistence (r-CLIPER) model was developed using microwave rainfall data from polar orbiting satellites over the ocean and first-order rainfall measurements from the land, to come up with a realistic rainfall distribution for tropical cyclones based on the National Hurricane Center's track forecast. It has been operational since 2004. A statistical-parametric wind radii model has been developed for use at the National Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center which uses climatology and persistence to predict wind structure out to five days into the future. Dynamical guidance Example of a SLOSH run During 1972, the first model to forecast storm surge along the continental shelf of the United States was developed, known as the Special Program to List the Amplitude of Surges from Hurricanes (SPLASH). In 1978, the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics ‚Äì the movable fine-mesh (MFM) model ‚Äì began operating. The Quasi-Lagrangian Limited Area (QLM) model is a multi-level primitive equation model using a Cartesian grid and the Global Forecast System (GFS) for boundary conditions. In the early 1980s, the assimilation of satellite-derived winds from water vapor, infrared, and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and the mid-1980s. Once it was determined that it could show skill in hurricane prediction, a multi-year transition transformed the research model into an operational model which could be used by the National Weather Service for both track and intensity forecasting in 1995. By 1985, the Sea Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model had been developed for use in areas of the Gulf of Mexico and near the United States' East coast, which was more robust than the SPLASH model. The Beta Advection Model (BAM) has been used operationally since 1987 using steering winds averaged through the 850 hPa to 200 hPa layer and the Beta effect which causes a storm to drift northwest due to differences in the coriolis effect across the tropical cyclone. The larger the cyclone, the larger the impact of the beta effect is likely to be. Starting in 1990, three versions of the BAM were run operationally: the BAM shallow (BAMS) average winds in an 850 hPa to 700 hPa layer, the BAM Medium (BAMM) which uses average winds in an 850 hPa to 400 hPa layer, and the BAM Deep (BAMD) which is the same as the pre-1990 BAM. For a weak hurricane without well-developed central thunderstorm activity, BAMS works well, because weak storms tend to be steered by low-level winds. As the storm grows stronger and associated thunderstorm activity near its center gets deeper, BAMM and BAMD become more accurate, as these types of storms are steered more by the winds in the upper-level. If the forecast from the three versions is similar, then the forecaster can conclude that there is minimal uncertainty, but if the versions vary by a great deal, then the forecaster has less confidence in the track predicted due to the greater uncertainty. Large differences between model predictions can also indicate wind shear in the atmosphere, which could affect the intensity forecast as well. Tested in 1989 and 1990, The Vic Ooyama Barotropic (VICBAR) model used a cubic-B spline representation of variables for the objective analysis of observations and solutions to the shallow-water prediction equations on nested domains, with the boundary conditions defined as the global forecast model. It was implemented operationally as the Limited Area Sine Transform Barotropic (LBAR) model in 1992, using the GFS for boundary conditions. By 1990, Australia had developed its own storm surge model which was able to be run in a few minutes on a personal computer. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) developed its own Typhoon Model (TYM) in 1994, and in 1998, the agency began using its own dynamic storm surge model. Hurricane Irene The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model is a specialized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and is used to forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones. The model was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island, and Florida State University. It became operational in 2007. Despite improvements in track forecasting, predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Other than the specialized guidance, global guidance such as the GFS, Unified Model (UKMET), NOGAPS, Japanese Global Spectral Model (GSM), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, France's Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) and Aire Limit¬¥ee Adaptation Dynamique Initialisation (ALADIN) models, India's National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) model, Korea's Global Data Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) and Regional Data Assimilation and Prediction System (RDAPS) models, Hong Kong/China's Operational Regional Spectral Model (ORSM) model, and Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) model are used for track and intensity purposes. Timeliness Some models do not produce output quickly enough to be used for the forecast cycle immediately after the model starts running (including HWRF, GFDL, and FSSE). Most of the above track models (except CLIPER) require data from global weather models, such as the GFS, which produce output about four hours after the synoptic times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). For half of their forecasts, the NHC issues forecasts only three hours after that time, so some \\"early\\" models ‚Äì NHC90, BAM, and LBAR ‚Äì are run using a 12-hour-old forecast for the current time. \\"Late\\" models, such as the GFS and GFDL, finish after the advisory has already been issued. These models are interpolated to the current storm position for use in the following forecast cycle ‚Äì for example, GFDI, the interpolated version of the GFDL model. Consensus methods Top: WRF model simulation of Hurricane Rita tracks. Bottom: The spread of NHC multi-model ensemble forecast. Using a consensus of forecast models reduces forecast error. Trackwise, the GUNA model is a consensus of the interpolated versions of the GFDL, UKMET with quality control applied to the cyclone tracker, United States Navy NOGAPS, and GFS models. The version of the GUNA corrected for model biases is known as the CGUN. The TCON consensus is the GUNA consensus plus the Hurricane WRF model. The version of the TCON corrected for model biases is known as the TCCN. A lagged average of the last two runs of the members within the TCON plus the ECMWF model is known as the TVCN consensus. The version of the TVCN corrected for model biases is the TVCC consensus. In early 2013, The NAVGEM replaced the NOGAPS as the Navy's primary operational global forecast model. For the 2013 season, and until model verification can occur, it is not being utilized in the development of any consensus forecasts. For intensity, a combination of the LGEM, interpolated GFDL, interpolated HWRF, and DSHIPS models is known as the ICON consensus. The lagged average of the last two runs of models within the ICON consensus is called the IVCN consensus. Across the northwest Pacific and Southern Hemisphere, a ten-member STIPS consensus is formed from the output of the NOGAPS, GFS, the Japanese GSM, the Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS), the UKMET, the Japanese TYM, the GFDL with NOGAPS boundary conditions, the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) Model, the Australian Tropical Cyclone Local Area Prediction System, and the Weber Barotropic Model. Ensemble methods No model is ever perfectly accurate because it is impossible to learn exactly everything about the atmosphere in a timely enough manner, and atmospheric measurements that are taken are not completely accurate. The use of the ensemble method of forecasting, whether it be a multi-model ensemble, or numerous ensemble members based on the global model, helps define the uncertainty and further limit errors. The JMA has produced an 11-member ensemble forecast system for typhoons known as the Typhoon Ensemble Prediction System (TEPS) since February 2008, which is run out to 132 hours into the future. It uses a lower resolution version (with larger grid spacing) of its GSM, with ten perturbed members and one non-perturbed member. The system reduces errors by an average of five days into the future when compared to its higher resolution GSM. The Florida State Super Ensemble (FSSE) is produced from a suite of models which then uses statistical regression equations developed over a training phase to reduce their biases, which produces forecasts better than the member models or their mean solution. It uses 11 global models, including five developed at Florida State University, the Unified Model, the GFS, the NOGAPS, the United States Navy NOGAPS, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC) model, and Canadian Recherche en Pr√©vision Num√©rique (RPN) model. It shows significant skill in track, intensity, and rainfall predictions of tropical cyclones. The Systematic Approach Forecast Aid (SAFA) was developed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to create a selective consensus forecast which removed more erroneous forecasts at a 72‚Äëhour time frame from consideration using the United States Navy NOGAPS model, the GFDL, the Japan Meteorological Agency's global and typhoon models, as well as the UKMET. All the models improved during SAFA's five-year history and removing erroneous forecasts proved difficult to do in operations. Sunspot theory A 2010 report correlates low sunspot activity with high hurricane activity. Analyzing historical data, there was a 25% chance of at least one hurricane striking the continental United States during a peak sunspot year; a 64% chance during a low sunspot year. In June 2010, the hurricanes predictors in the US were not using this information. Hurricane forecast model accuracy The accuracy of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm. For some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively straightforward, and the models are not only accurate but they produce similar forecasts, while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts.

Early life Reston was born in New York City and raised in Washington, D.C., the son of journalist James \\"Scotty\\" Reston and Sally Fulton. He was awarded a Morehead Scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and earned his BA in philosophy there in 1963. At UNC, he was an All-South soccer player, and retains the single game scoring record for the university (5 goals against NC State, October 18, 1962). He attended Oxford University during his junior year. Career Reston was an assistant to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall (1964‚Äì1965) and served in the U.S. Army (1965‚Äì1968) as an intelligence officer. He was a lecturer in Creative Writing at the University of North Carolina (1971‚Äì81). Reston is a Senior Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington D.C.James Reston Jr, Wilson Center Experts, Wilson Center and has been a fellow at the American Academy in Rome and a resident scholar at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Reston is the author of 18 books, four plays, and numerous articles in national magazines. His works of both fiction and non-fiction cover a wide range of historical and political topics. He was awarded the Prix Italia and the Dupont‚ÄìColumbia Award for his 1983 90-minute radio documentary on National Public Radio, Father Cares: the Last of Jonestown. Five of his works, Galileo: A Life, The Last Apocalypse, Warriors of God, Dogs of God, and Luther's Fortress have been translated into thirteen foreign languages. Warriors of God was an international best seller. The Last Apocalypse was a main selection of the Book of the Month Club in 1999. His 2015 book, Luther's Fortress, was nominated for the prestigious Philip Schaff Prize for the best book about church history published in 2015‚Äì16. The Innocence of Joan Little, Warriors of God, Collision at Home Plate and a forthcoming novel, The 19th Hijacker have been optioned by Hollywood. In 1976‚Äì77, Reston was David Frost's Watergate adviser for the historic Nixon interviews which forced ex-President Nixon to apologize for his Watergate crimes and remains the most watched public affairs television program in broadcast history. (The Watergate interrogation had an audience of 57 million viewers.) Reston wrote an 80 page interrogation document for Frost, before the Watergate interrogation that included tapes of incriminating conversations between Richard Nixon and his aide, Charles Colson that surprised Nixon and allowed Frost to take control of the interchange. Reston's book on the historic interviews, The Conviction of Richard Nixon, is the basis for the play Frost/Nixon, in which the Jim Reston character is the narrator. In the Hollywood film adaptation of the play, directed by Ron Howard, Reston is played by the actor Sam Rockwell. The movie received five Academy Award nominations. In October 2019 he published his diary of the last six weeks of the Nixon presidency which he wrote in 1974 when he came to Washington from North Carolina to witness the impeachment drama. Its title is The Impeachment Diary: Eyewitness to the Removal of a President. Of it, the distinguished constitutional scholar and Harvard professor, Laurence Tribe wrote: \\"If ever there was an ‚Äúeyewitness to history‚Äù worthy of the name, James Reston Jr. surely deserves that title. His close-up-and-personal account of the process that drove an American president from office is impossible to put down. To read it is to live it.\\" Reston's 2013 work, The Accidental Victim, is a non- fiction book about John F. Kennedy's assassination that presented the controversial argument that Texas Governor John Connally, not John F.Kennedy, was Lee Harvey Oswald's intended victim. In the book and in an earlier opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times (November 22, 2004) Reston also argued that President Kennedy would have survived Oswald's first bullet that passed through his neck, but the tight girdle the president wore to support his bad back held him upright in the presidential limousine for the assassin's fatal second shot. The author has remarked in an interview with the Georgia Review (summer 2019) that the two hardest books he wrote were the book about the 1978 Jonestown mass suicide entitled Our Father Who Art in Hell: the Life and Death of the Reverend Jim Jones (1981) and the book about his handicapped daughter, Hillary called Fragile Innocence (2006). About the emotional difficulties of a writer dealing with difficult material, Reston wrote an essay, also in the 2018 summer issue of the Georgia Review, entitled: \\"The Novelist's Event: Fact, Fiction, and a Writer's Search for a Universal Subject.\\" In 1985 Reston was the Newsweek, PBS, and BBC candidate to be the first writer in space on the NASA space shuttle. That program was scrapped after the Challenger accident in January 1986. The author was the creator of four public television documentaries: \\"88 Seconds in Greensboro\\" (1984) was an inside look into the killings of civil rights protesters by Ku Klux Klansmen in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1983. It won the Ohio State Award for excellence in broadcasting; \\"The Real Stuff\\" (1985) about the risk astronauts face on the space shuttle; \\"The Mission of Discovery\\"(1988) was a WETA-BBC co-production about the preparations for first space shuttle mission after the Challenger disaster; and \\"Betting on the Lottery\\" 1990) on the state lottery phenomenon. A Rift in the Earth: Art, Memory, and the Fight for a Vietnam Memorial was published in 2017. Springing from the roots of his military service during the Vietnam War, the book tells the story of the five-year battle between youthful Maya Lin, the winning designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and a determined group of veterans, led by ex-Virginia senator Jim Webb, who opposed the design as insulting to veterans and who tried to scuttle the choice. The New York Times dubbed A Rift in the Earth \\"a superb and unexpectedly affecting book.\\" Reston's four plays are: \\"Sherman the Peacemaker\\" which premiered at the Playmakers Repertory Company in Chapel Hill, N.C. in 1979; \\"Jonestown Express\\" premiered at the Trinity Square Repertory Company in 1982; \\"Galileo's Torch\\", which adapted from his biography of Galileo, has had seven productions between 2014‚Äì17, including at the University of Oklahoma, Folger Shakespeare Theatre, and the Castleton Festival in 2017; and \\"Luther's Trumpet\\", an adaptation of his 2016 book, Luther's Fortress, premiered in September 2018. Reston's articles have appeared in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Time, The New York Times Magazine, George, Esquire, American Theatre, Playboy, and Rolling Stone. In recent years he has lectured widely in the United States and overseas on the millennium and the Crusades, citing their relevance to modern issues. Personal life Reston is married, has three children, and lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland. His eldest daughter, Maeve Reston, is a television journalist. His book, Fragile Innocence, A Father's Memoir of His Daughter's Courageous Journey (2006), is the story of his disabled daughter, Hillary. A front page review in the Washington Post called it \\"carefully crafted....a page-turning read\\" and Newsweek called it \\"a story of love and hope.\\" A Washington Post Book World Best Book of 2006 and a finalist for the 2006 Books for a Better Life Award, it was briefly on the Washington Post best seller list. Legacy Reston is depicted in the 2008 film Frost/Nixon, portrayed by Sam Rockwell.

First OVA Genji and Milfa get married, and are the only ones in the church for the wedding except for the minister, due to a high level of general tension and dislike between humans and elves. Soon, however, Genji and Milfa find their own problems when Genji discovers during sexual foreplay that Milfa's vagina is no bigger than a belly-button, thus preventing them from having sex and starting a family together. Genji, however, hears of the mystical Harpy Ooze, a lubricant that may solve their problems. Genji sets off to find the Ooze, reluctantly leaving Milfa alone in the elf-hating human town. Milfa, however, earns the respect of the townspeople after saving two children from a rampaging hydra. Genji, meanwhile, finds the lair of the Harpies: female, angel-like creatures who are known to abduct and rape young men so as to have children. Genji is captured by the Harpy Princess, Pisda, who subsequently rapes him. Genji tries to resist, but is unable to stop himself impregnating her. As a reward, however, Genji is given a bottle of Harpy Ooze. Second OVA Returning home, Genji and Milfa attempt to have sex again, this time with different positions, but are still unsuccessful. Milfa decides to visit the local gynecologist, without telling Genji. While Genji is away, Milfa goes to the clinic and meets several other women with similar problems. Genji, meanwhile, returns home and discovers a dead security guard and a stunningly beautiful young woman who turns out to be his grandmother, Mitsuko, a sorceress who steals men's spirits by having sex with them in order to maintain her youthful appearance, and so did it to the security guard. Mitsuko informs Genji that Milfa has gone to the clinic, and Genji panics: the owner of the clinic is the infamous, lecherous incubus, Dr. Perio, who is a former friend of Genji's. Knowing that Perio will try to rape Milfa, Genji rushes to her rescue with Mitsuko in tow. Milfa meets Perio, who immediately begins touching her up and undressing the both of them. However, when Milfa suddenly headbutts Perio, it turns out to have been a hallucination he had been planting in both of their minds for sexual pleasure. Genji suddenly bursts in, ready to kill Perio, but Perio flees from the treatment room until he is ambushed by Mitsuko, who proceeds to rape him and steal his spirit, subsequently killing him.

Temperatures range between a maximum of 40 degrees in March / April and at least 12 ¬∞C in December. The natural vegetation of the district consists of tree savanna, with baobab, and acacia trees. The low vegetation is burned by fire during the dry season or dried by the sun. Demographics The inhabitants of the district belong predominantly to different peoples of Northern Ghana. The town of Bolgatanga, however, has a cosmopolitan character. Here are mixed not only different peoples of the north, but also members of the major ethnic groups including the Grune, sisala, and kanjegah peoples. Hausa and Moshi people. Economy The majority of the population in the 1990s lived, in spite of the urban structure of the district, from agriculture, 19% commercial, 12% industry, mainly handicrafts, and just 7.4% were employed in public services. There are some jobs in the mining and construction and in the form of some metal-working companies, repair shops, painting companies etc. but these represent a very small minority.

It ran northeast from the Gulf of Aqaba for about at its greatest extent, reaching northern Syria and forming part of the wider Roman limes system. It had several forts and watchtowers. The reason of this defensive limes was to protect the Roman province of Arabia from attacks of the barbarian tribes of the Arabian desert. The main purpose of the Limes Arabicus is disputed; it may have been used both to defend from Arab raids and to protect the commercial lines from robbers. Next to the Limes Arabicus Emperor Trajan built a major road, the Via Nova Traiana, from Bosra to Aila on the Red Sea, a distance of . Built between 111 and 114 AD, its primary purpose may have been to provide efficient transportation for troop movements and government officials as well as facilitating and protecting trade caravans emerging from the Arabian Peninsula. It was completed under Emperor Hadrian.Young, Gary K. Rome's Eastern Trade: International commerce and imperial policy, 31 BC ‚Äì AD 305 p. 119 Fortification During the Severan dynasty (AD 193‚Äì235), the Romans strengthened their defences on the Arabian frontier. They constructed several castra (forts) at the northwest end of the Wadi Sirhan, and improved the roads. One important fort was Qasr Azraq, another was at Humeima (Latin: Auara), from the late 2nd century AD, on the Via Nova from Petra to Aila, where up to 500 auxiliary troops could have resided. It was probably abandoned in the fourth century.Roman castra of Humeima Diocese of the East around 400 AD Emperor Diocletian partitioned the old province of Arabia by transferring the southern region to the province of Palaestina. Later in the 4th century, Palaestina was made into three provinces, and the southern one was eventually called Palaestina Tertia. Each province was administered by a praeses with civil authority and a dux with military authority. Diocletian engaged in a major military expansion in the region, building a number of castella, watchtowers, and fortresses along the fringe of the desert just east of the Via Nova. This line of defence extended from south of Damascus to Wadi al-Hasa. The region from Wadi Mujib to Wadi al- Hasa contained four castella and a legionary camp. The frontier south of Wadi al-Hasa, which extended to the Red Sea at Aila (Aqaba), may have been called the Limes Palaestina.Parker 1986, p. 6 In this region, ten castella and a legionary camp have been identified. The term may have referred to a series of fortifications and roads in the northern Negev, running from Rafah on the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea,Gichon 1991 or to the region under the military control of the dux Palaestinae, the military governor of the Palaestinian provinces.Isaac 1990, pp. 408 ‚Äì 409 Personnel There were castra every with the purpose to create a line of protection and control:Purpose of Roman castra in Arabia in the south there was the legionary fortress at Adrou (Udruh), just east of Petra. It probably housed the Legio VI Ferrata, which was moved from Lajjun (in modern-day Israel) by Diocletian. It is similar to Betthorus (al-Lajjun in modern-day Jordan) in size () and design, and is in the plain of Moab, south of Wadi Mujib . Alistair Killick, who excavated the site, dates it to the early 2nd century, but Parker suggests a date in the late 3rd or early 4th century. A legionary camp may have also existed at Aila (modern Aqaba), which has been excavated by Parker since 1994. The city was located at the north end of the Gulf of Aqaba where it was a centre of sea traffic. Several land routes also intersected here. Legio X Fretensis, originally stationed in Jerusalem, was transferred here to the terminus of the Via Nova. So far, a stone curtain wall and projecting tower have been identified, but it is uncertain whether they were part of the city wall of Aila or the fortress. The evidence suggests the fort was constructed in the late 4th or early 5th century. Troops were progressively withdrawn from the Limes Arabicus in the first half of the 6th century and replaced with native Arab foederati, chiefly the Ghassanids.End of Limes Arabicus After the Muslim Arab conquest, the Limes Arabicus was largely left to disappear, though some fortifications were used and reinforced in the following centuries. History The limes was overrun in 611 during the war with the Sasanians.

(Political boundaries added) The Baltic Ice Lake is a name given by geologists to a freshwater lake that gradually formed in the Baltic Sea basin as glaciation retreated from that region at the end of the Pleistocene. The lake, dated to 12,600-10,300 BP, is roughly contemporaneous with the three Pleistocene Blytt-Sernander periods. The lake followed a period of massive glaciation in the region, which followed the end of the Eemian Sea. The post-glacial Yoldia Sea was immediately subsequent to the Baltic Ice Lake. Phenomena related to ice lake and sea formation Post- glacial sea level, combined with isostatic rebound, resulted in a sequence of Baltic lakes and seas. The term lake is used to mean a body of primarily fresh water. A sea is filled with brackish or salt water. In the history of the Baltic Sea, the distinction is not always clear. Salinity has varied with location, depth and time. The main factors are the advance or recession of the Scandinavian glacier and the isostatic sinking of the landforms due to the weight of ice or isostatic rebound (springing back) when relieved of it. The glacier provides a massive flow of fresh water. Salt water enters from the North Sea through straits when the sea level is high enough to allow reverse flow over the sill. When the straits are above sea level or close to sea level, fresh water will accumulate and a lake forms. Fresh water will accumulate to levels substantially higher than sea level when the sills are substantially above sea level. The release of fresh water from the glaciers depends on climate; the presence or absence of entrances to the ocean depends on land rise and oceanic water level; the latter of course is also affected by the amount of ice held in glaciers worldwide. Several methods are used to determine the quality (temperature, salinity, solids content) of ancient sea water. The main one is the type of diatoms found in the sediment. Some species require salt water, while others require fresh. Other invertebrates serve as marker species as well. Also, periods of maximum supply from melt water are marked by low organic carbon in the sediment. Higher carbon content causes greater deposition of iron sulfide, which appears as a black varve. Formation In this winter picture of modern Scandinavia, taken in 2002, the snow line approximates the edge of the glacier 10,000 BP. The lake egressed across Sweden just south of the line, through V√§nern, which is visible. The edge of the retreating Weichselian glacier departed from the Lake Gardno end- moraines of Pomerania (in present-day northern Poland) at around 14,000 BP and reached the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in the time window 13,500/13,000 BP. In the next several hundred years, closed fresh-water pools formed in the southern Baltic region from melt water as the ice retreated northward. These were about above the current sea level. By 12,000 BP the edge of the glacier was at a line across southern Sweden to the northern shore of the Baltic countries. A connected body of water, the Ramsay Sea, stretched from the Danish islands region to the shores of Estonia. The Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland were still glaciated, as well as nearly all of Sweden north of Scania. In the Aller√∏d warm-period, rising land in the Denmark region created the Baltic Ice Lake. It egressed through a small channel in the Strait of √òresund. The lake was higher than sea level (which itself was lower than the present- day sea level) by some tens of metres. Lake Ladoga formed part of the Baltic Ice Lake. Emergence of the land then closed the channel through the Strait of √ñresund. The lake rose until at about 11,200 BP it broke through a narrow corridor in the region of Mount Billingen in present-day south-west Sweden; Quaternary geologists used to describe the break-through as a massive, single tap of Niagara-like force, but it is now considered more likely that it happened in several steps over a limited period, perhaps a century, and along different local troughs and passages. By 10,800 BP the lake had dropped . At that point the climate reverted into cooling, and during a cold-climate period the glacier advanced again over the central Swedish exit. The lake became blocked again, rose about , and broke through the Strait of Oresund. By this time the Gulf of Finland had been deglaciated. At the peak of this high-water phase, most of Finland was under water, including present-day Helsinki at a depth of ; only southern Sweden was both free of ice and above the waterline. The Danish Islands were all connected west of the Strait of Oresund. Around 10,500 BP the climate became warmer, the ice retreated to the north of Mount Billingen, and the waters broke through central Sweden again, providing a second egress. Water level dropped to the sea level of that time. Summary At about 16,000 BP the retreating ice had reached the southern shores of the present Baltic. Melt water formed extensive lacustrine systems still visible today in north Russia, Poland and Germany. By 14,600 BP the Baltic Ice Lake had come into existence. Beyond it only southern Sweden was habitable, and it was an island. 'Scandinavia' means \\"the island of Scandza\\" or \\"Scandia\\", which cannot be accounted for by today's map, and is generally assumed to be an inadvertent misrepresentation by ancient geographers. However, the first Scandinavia was an island, and was identical to southern Sweden. Several carbon-dated sites in Estonia indicate that human habitation of the shores of the Baltic Ice Lake began in the Boreal period, in the time window 11,200-10,200 BP. Charcoal, animal bones, and artefacts from Mesolithic temporary settlements have been found at Pulli and in the Lake Ladoga region. The diet included roe deer, red deer, marten, otter, wolf, bear and ringed seal. An open pine-birch forest covered the region. Pollen from Pinus, Betula, Alnus, Rosaceae, Cyperaceae and Artemisia have been found. Around 10,300 BP, the ice lake discharged through channels that opened in central Sweden (near Mount Billingen) until it reached the ocean level. The Yoldia Sea phase began (10,300-9,500 BP).

Autocorrection, also known as text replacement, replace-as-you-type or simply autocorrect, is an automatic data validation function commonly found in word processors and text editing interfaces for smartphones and tablet computers. Its principal purpose is as part of the spell checker to correct common spelling or typing errors, saving time for the user. It is also used to automatically format text or insert special characters by recognizing particular character usage, saving the user from having to use more tedious functions. Disadvantages Some writers and organizations choose to consistently replace some words with others as part of their editorial policy, with occasionally unforeseen results. For example, the American Family Association chose to replace all instances of the word \\"gay\\" on its website with the word \\"homosexual\\". This caused an article about US Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay to be littered with confusing sentences such as, \\"In Saturday's opening heat, Homosexual pulled way up, way too soon, and nearly was caught by the field, before accelerating again and lunging in for fourth place\\". Humour Misuse of text replacement software is a staple practical joke in many schools and offices. Typically, the prankster will set the victim's word processing software to replace an extremely common word with a humorous absurdity, or an incorrectly spelled version of the original word. The growing use of autocorrection on smartphones has also led to the creation of at least one website, Damn You Auto Correct, where people post and share humorous or embarrassing cases of improper autocorrections. Damn You Auto Correct started in 2010 by Jillian Madison. It is also the name of a book Madison wrote that was published in 2011 by Hyperion Books. The website and the book both compile texts sent on iPhones that were altered by the phone's autocorrection feature to produce what are often unintentionally funny messages. Within a week of its launch, the website had collected hundreds of submissions and had attracted about one million page views.

Many authorities consider the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse to be a subspecies, but the two are now usually treated separately.  Distribution  Its range extends from southwest British Columbia and southeast Alberta continuously to west Texas, northeast Arkansas, northwest Indiana, southwest Wisconsin, and the interior of Mexico to Oaxaca.  Description and comparison with similar species  The harvest mouse has brownish fur with buff sides, a white belly, and an indistinct white stripe on the fur along the spine. Adults grow up to eleven to seventeen centimeters in length with a tail length of five to ten centimeters. Their height (from the ground to the highest point of their back) is between 1.5 and 2.0 centimeters. A mature mouse weighs anywhere from nine to twenty-two grams. There is no sexual dimorphism in this species. Similar species are the plains harvest mouse, which has a more distinct but narrower stripe on its spine, and the fulvous harvest mouse, which has a longer tail. Also similar is the salt marsh harvest mouse, which has an underbelly fur that is more pinkish cinnamon to tawny. Finally, the house mouse has incisors without grooves, unlike those of the western harvest mouse. The dental formula of Reithrodontomys megalotis is = 16.  Behavior  The mouse is nocturnal, with particularly intense activity on very dark nights. This mouse is particularly resourceful, making use of the ground runways of other rodents. It is also a very agile climber. Once temperatures reach a certain degree, the western harvest mouse goes into torpor, but scientists have yet to determine if it goes into true hibernation. This mouse builds spherical nests that are about 125mm in diameter. These nests can be found on the ground or under trees, logs, or plants that aid in protection from predators. Nests can also be found above ground or in burrows. There are usually one or more access points at the base of the nest.  Diet  The western harvest mouse is an herbivore with a diet consisting of mainly seeds and grains from various plants. These plants include: fruits, vetch, blue grass, fescue, oats, and brome grass. In preparation for autumn and winter, the western harvest mouse stores its food along runways created throughout fields that it occupies and in underground vaults. Although its primary food source is seeds, springtime dining is augmented with new plant growth. In June, July and August the mouse is known to consume certain insects, especially grasshoppers and caterpillars. Breeding Breeding nests are spherical constructions woven from grass or other plant material. A nest is approximately 13 centimeters in diameter and lined with a more downy material of fibrous plants. A nest may have one or more entrances near its base. Most commonly, the nest is built on the ground in a protected area such as within a shrub or beside a fallen tree. However, the mouse will occasionally place the nest aboveground within a shrub. It breeds from early spring to late autumn, with reduced activity at midsummer. The gestation period is 23 to 24 days. Repeated fertilization often occurs immediately after giving birth. It is not uncommon for a female to have ten to fourteen litters per annum, with a typical litter size of two to six individuals. However, litters of up to nine offspring can occur. Thus an annual production of forty to sixty young per female is normal. Newborn mice weigh approximately 1.0 to 1.5 grams.University of Michigan Museum of Zoology's Animal Diversity Web \\"Reithrodontomys megalotis western harvest mouse\\" Accessed July 8, 2010  Threats  Domestic and feral cats are a threat to the western harvest mouse. On the IUCN Red List it is listed as \\"Least Concern\\" (LC). Its many predators include the fox, weasel, coyote, hawk, snake and owl species. Other predators include shrikes, squirrels, raptors, short-tailed shrews, cats, and scorpions. References * National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals, ed. by John O.

Many of these clients include both a GUI editor for composing HTML emails and a rendering engine for displaying received HTML emails. Since its conception, a number of people have vocally opposed all HTML email (and even MIME itself), for a variety of reasons.HTML Email: Whenever Possible, Turn It Off! For instance, the ASCII Ribbon Campaign advocated that all email should be sent in ASCII text format. The campaign was unsuccessful and was abandoned in 2013. While still considered inappropriate in many newsgroup postings and mailing lists, its adoption for personal and business mail has only increased over time. Some of those who strongly opposed it when it first came out now see it as mostly harmless.HTML Email: The Poll (Scot Hacker, originator of the much- linked-to Why HTML in E-Mail is a Bad Idea discusses how his feelings have changed since the 1990s) According to surveys by online marketing companies, adoption of HTML-capable email clients is now nearly universal, with less than 3% reporting that they use text-only clients.

The provincial subdivision has a population of about 24,282 inhabitants in an area of , and its capital city is Villa Gesell, which is around from Buenos Aires. Economy The economy of Villa Gesell is dominated by the summer tourist season, which sees thousands of holidaymakers make their way to the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province. The main tourist season lasts from December until February, after the end of the main holiday season most of the hotels, bars and restaurants close up, but some of the local establishments and hostels remain open all year round. History In 1931 Don Carlos Idaho Gesell purchased of sand dunes, and over the years he planted many thousands of trees and built a home for his family. Between the 1940s and the 1970s the population of Villa Gesell swelled as hippies and free thinkers fleeing the crowded metropolis of Buenos Aires made their way to the picturesque coastal village. In the early years of Villa Gesell, Don Carlos Gesell introduced the \\"Plan galopante\\" (galloping plan) which meant if one would purchase a property inside Villa Gesell, and have built a home within a specified period of time, a percentage of the purchase price would be returned, or cut off from the remainder of payments, in time bringing about thousands of people from around the world, especially Germany and Italy and other European nations, seeking a quiet and peaceful place to live. In or around 1970 Villa Gesell gained its status as a city, and as the settlement of Villa Gesell grew in popularity, commercial interests took over, ruining Calos Gesell's idea of a tranquil village surrounded by nature. As the sand dunes were bulldozed to make space for seafront bars and restaurants, further along the coast, the settlement of Mar Azul was established in order rehabilitate Carlos Gesell's ideals of urban development in tune with nature. Since 2004 work has been undertaken to remove many of the concrete seafront bars and restaurants, in order to return the coastline of Villa Gesell to the state Carlos Gesell had intended. Villa Gesell is host to \\"Le Touquet\\", one of the largest motocross races in the world. These races are held at nearby cities from time to time.

The authorship of the work is unknown. There is a general consensus that it was an ensemble effort, but it has often been attributed to Oscar Wilde. Set in fin-de-si√®cle Paris, its concerns are the magnetic attraction and passionate though ultimately tragic affair between a young Frenchman named Camille Des Grieux and the Hungarian pianist Ren√© Teleny. The novel is one of the earliest pieces of English-language pornography that focuses explicitly and near-exclusively on homosexuality (following The Sins of the Cities of the Plain, published in 1881). Its lush and literate, though variable prose style and the relative complexity and depth of character and plot development share as much with the Aesthetic fiction of the period as with its typical pornography. History of publication Wilde's authorship, while unproven, is claimed by erotic bookseller and pornographer Charles Hirsch, \\"A few days later one of the young gentlemen I had seen with [Wilde] came to collect the package. He kept it for a while and then brought it back saying in turn: 'Would you kindly give this to one of our friends who will come to fetch it in the same person‚Äôs name'\\". Hirsch recounts three further repetitions of this \\"identical ceremony\\" before the package made its way back to Wilde. Hirsch defied the strict instructions not to open the package while it was in his care, and claims that it was written in several different hands, which lends further support to his supposition that it was authored in \\"round robin\\" style by a small group of Wilde's intimate associates.Nelson, James.

By 1893, the manuscript had made its way into the hands of Leonard Smithers, who since 1892 had been in business with Harry Sidney Nichols, Smithers serving primarily as an \\"entrepreneurial\\" liaison between \\"authors, publishers, and distributors\\". Smithers and Nichols were aligned with William Lazenby, Edward Avery, and Charles Carrington, in a small and tightly interwoven group of late Victorian publishers heavily involved in the production and distribution of pornography in London and Paris. Smithers worked extensively in the 1890s with Wilde and his circle, as is indicated by the title of James Nelson's book on Smithers, Publisher to the Decadents. Lisa Sigel claims that unlike most pornographers, who were eager to preserve their anonymity for reasons of respectability and safety, Smithers \\"embrace[d] public scrutiny\\" and managed to earn some renown for encouraging and orchestrating the collaboration of Wilde and Beardsley on Salom√©.Sigel, Lisa, Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914. Piscataway: Rutgers University Press, 2002. From 1892-1894 Smithers and Nichols released, among other projects, a series of pornographic novels under the imprint Erotika Biblion Society. Teleny was published 1893 as part of this series in a limited edition of 200 copies, with significant edits by Smithers, including the omission of an introduction and a change in the setting from London to Paris. Smithers promoted it in an advertisement, sent to a select group of subscribers, as \\"undoubtedly, the most powerful and most cleverly written erotic Romance which has appeared in the English language during recent years,\\" authored by \\"a man of great imagination‚Ä¶[who] has conceived a thrilling story.\\" And: \\"It is a most extraordinary story of passion, and while dealing with scenes which surpass in freedom the wildest license, the culture of its author‚Äôs style adds an additional piquancy and spice to the narration\\". Judged by the traditional literary standards of plot, character, suspense, variation, style, etc. which usually find pornography lacking, Teleny stands apart from its contemporaries as the \\"most powerful and most cleverly written erotic Romance.\\" Hirsch published a translation into French in Paris in 1934Edouard Roditi, \\"Oscar Wilde\\", New Directions Publishing, 1986, , p.166 shifting the locale back to London. A paperback edition from Icon Books came out in 1966. This was an expurgated version due to the laws regarding obscene publication in effect at the time. In the introduction to that edition, readers are advised that if they wish to see the complete text they can in the British Museum, where a copy is kept in the Private Case. In 1986, it was published in London by Gay Men's Press in the series Gay Modern Classics; Wordsworth Classics published it in 1995 in their series Wordsworth Classic Erotica . The most recent edition, edited by Amanda Mordavsky Caleb, was published by Valancourt Books in 2010.  Plot summary  The story begins with Des Grieux attending a concert with his mother; he experiences strange and suggestive visions during one piano performance ‚Äì by the beautiful Hungarian Teleny. Des Grieux becomes fascinated by the man and by the sporadically and frequently sexual telepathic connection he feels with Teleny, and this feeling becomes a mixture of curiosity, admiration, and desire, which quickly leads to jealousy. Des Grieux knows that Teleny attracts many men and women before their relationship begins. Eventually they meet and share their experiences of their unexplained bond which quickly leads to a passionate affair. Des Grieux feels very torn about loving and desiring a man and attempts to genuinely sexually interest himself in a household servant, but in so doing indirectly leads to her death. Thus shaken, he vows not to fight his feelings and allows Teleny to introduce him to an underground sexual society of males desiring men. Their love continues through a blackmailing attempt and their emotional struggles, until Teleny declares a need to leave for a time, ostensibly for a concert performance. During this time Des Grieux goes to Teleny's apartments only to find Teleny in bed with Des Grieux's mother, who had offered to pay Teleny's debts in return for sexual favours. The two part badly; Des Grieux nearly commits suicide and remains isolated in the hospital for many days. When he leaves he goes to Teleny only to find that his lover has stabbed himself in remorse, and is bleeding to death. Des Grieux forgives Teleny; they re-declare their love, and Teleny dies.  Adaptations  A comic book adaptation by Jon Macy entitled Teleny and Camille, published by Northwest Press in 2010, won the 2010 Lambda Literary Award for Gay Erotica. In May 2014, Melbourne's Fly-On-The-Wall Theatre presented a stage production of Teleny adapted by playwright Barry Lowe, directed by Robert Chuter.

NGOs are independent of governments and can be seen as two types, advocacy NGOs, which aim to influence governments with a specific goal, and operational NGOs, which provide services.IGO-NGO Cooperation.\\" .https://guides.library.duke.edu/c.php?g=289595&p;=1930435 (accessed February 19, 2020). Examples of NGO mandates are environmental preservation, human rights promotions or the advancement of women. NGOs are typically not-for- profit, but receive funding from companies or membership fees. Many large INGOs have components of operational projects and advocacy initiatives working together within individual countries. The technical term \\"international organizations\\" describes intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and include groups such as the United Nations or the International Labour Organization, which are formed by treaties among sovereign states. In contrast, INGOs are defined as \\"any internationally operating organization which is not established by inter-governmental agreement\\". An INGO may be founded by private philanthropy, such as the Carnegie, Rockefeller, Gates and Ford Foundations, or as an adjunct to existing international organizations, such as the Catholic or Lutheran churches. A surge in INGOs for economic development occurred during World War II, some of which would later become large organizations like SOS Children's Villages, Oxfam, Catholic Relief Services, CARE International and Lutheran World Relief. The number of INGOs grew from 6,000 in 1990 to 26,000 in 1999, and a 2013 report estimated about 40,000. Aside from incorporation under national laws, no current formal legal status exists for INGOs, which can lead to complications. History In 1910, the Union of International Associations (UIA) were the first to suggest that a \\"super-national\\" status be given to international organizations with diplomatic intentions without governmental influence. The International Law Association (ILA) modified this, adding that this \\"super-national\\" organizational status may be adopted for associations formed for no profit. Activities The main focus of INGOs is to provide relief and developmental aid to developing countries. Health-related projects such as HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention and treatment, clean water, and malaria prevention‚Äîand education-related projects such as schools for girls and providing books‚Äîhelp to provide the social services that the country's government does not provide. International non-governmental organizations are some of the first responders to natural disasters, like hurricanes and floods, or crises that need emergency relief. Other organizations, like the International Justice Mission, are working to make judicial systems more effective and legitimate. Still others, such as those promoting micro-finance and education, directly impact citizens and communities by developing skills and human capital while encouraging citizen empowerment and community involvement. NGOs, in general, account for over 15% of total international development aid, which is linked to economic development.\\"World Bank and NGOs.\\" October 3, 2007.http://library.duke.edu/research/subject/guides/ngo_guide/igo_ngo_coop/ngo_wb.html (accessed November 10, 2010). As of 2007, aid (partly contributed to by INGOs) over the past thirty years is estimated to have increased the annual growth rate of the bottom billion by one percent.Collier, Paul. 2007. The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. (p.100). Criticisms Given they are usually supported by donations, a popular concern about INGOs is where the money goes and whether it is spent efficiently. High administrative costs can be an indication of inefficiency, enrichment of employees at the expense of beneficiaries, embezzlement or misdirection of funds to corrupt local officials or dictatorship. Numerous attempts have been made to remedy the accountability of INGOs surrounding where and for what their money is being used. Websites like Charity Navigator and GiveWell attempt to provide transparency as to how much goes to administrative costs, what activities money is spent on, whether more donations would be helpful, and how cost- effective the activities are compared to other charities or potential activities. Another criticism is that many of the people benefiting from INGOs have no way to influence those activities and hold the organizations accountable.Ebrahim, A.: 2003, 'Accountability in Practice: Mechanisms for NGOs', World Development 31(5), 813-829. (for example by threatening to withhold donations). Some charitable organizations solicit the participation of local communities to avoid problems related to intercultural competence, and avoid unintended consequences due to lack of buy-in or lack of knowledge about local conditions. In March 2015, the European Journal of International Relations criticized the impact of INGOs on government decision-making, claiming they are slowing integration of developing countries into the global economy.

After their initial appearance, Burgess and Boylan continued to guest on the maestro's show for the next few weeks, either dancing to Calcutta or to the orchestra's next hit song Yellow Bird.

Birth and early years Beverly Waugh was born on 28 October 1789 in Fairfax County, Virginia, U.S.A., the son of a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. At the age of fifteen, he was converted to the Christian faith and became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Alexandria, Virginia. It is believed that he was employed as a clerk in a government office or in business for three or four years, given the excellent penmanship and accuracy of his accounts throughout his life. From the time he was eighteen until shortly before his death, he kept a journal which, in the end, amounted to several manuscript volumes. Ordained Ministry In 1809, aged 20, Waugh entered the itinerant ministry of the Baltimore Annual Conference. After three years he was stationed in the city of Washington. For 18 years he filled a number of the most prominent appointments in the Baltimore Conference. Waugh was elected by his peers to be a delegate to the General Conferences of 1816 and 1820, representing the Baltimore Conference. For the 1824 General Conference, because he was in favor of an elected Presiding Eldership (which the majority of his conference did not approve), he was not elected a delegate. In 1828, Waugh was again elected a member of General Conference, and was, at that time, chosen Assistant Editor and Agent of the Book Concern of the Methodist Episcopal Church, resulting in his restationing to New York City. This also necessitated his transfer to the New York Annual Conference, as the rule in force at that time constituted the Assistant Book Agent a member of that body. In his work with the Book Concern, Waugh was closely associated with John Emory, later Bishop. In 1832, Waugh was made the principal agent, through not a member of the General Conference that year. He was again a member of the 1836 General Conference. Episcopal ministry Waugh was elected to the Episcopacy of the Methodist Episcopal Church by the 1836 General Conference. He filled this highest office in the ordained ministry for nearly 22 years. After the death of Bishop Hedding in 1852, he was the Senior Bishop of his denomination. Waugh traveled almost constantly. He was never absent from one of his conferences. He organized the Rock River, Texas Annual Conference, with only nine members, as well as other Annual Conferences. Long before the time of railroads, his routes ranged from Michigan to Georgia, and Maine to Texas. He shared with his colleagues the responsibility of presiding over five sessions of the General Conference, some of which were the most laborious and difficult known in the history of the Church. It is supposed that the average number of preachers appointed by him per annum was probably 550, or about 12,000 altogether. Death Waugh visited Carlisle, Pennsylvania for several days in January 1858 to assist in a revival of religion. On his return home, he was seized with erysipelas and died on 9 February 1858 in Baltimore. The immediate cause of his death is supposed to have been an affection of the heart. He was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore, near the graves of Bishops Francis Asbury, Enoch George and John Emory. Selected writings *Beverly Waugh's Journal.

He is considered one of the greatest Hindi writers of modern India. A recognised poet, he was a trendsetter in Hindi prose-writing. He was an author of several dramas, life sketches and travel accounts; he used new media like reports, publications, letters to the editor, translations and literary works to shape public opinion.Vasudha Dalmia, Poetics, Plays and Performances: The Politics of Modern Indian Theatre, New Delhi, Oxford University Press (2006) Writing under the pen name \\"Rasa\\", Harishchandra represented the agonies of the people, country's poverty, dependency, inhuman exploitation, the unrest of the middle class and the urge for the progress of the country. He was an influential Hindu \\"traditionalist\\", using Vaishnava devotionalism to define a coherent Hindu religion .  Biography  Born in Agrawal caste in Banaras, Bharatendu Harishchandra's father Gopal Chandra was a poet. He wrote under the pseudonym Girdhar Das. Bharatendu's parents died when he was young but they seem to have had an influence on him. Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has described how Bharatendu went to the Jagannath temple in Puri, Orissa with his family in 1865, when he was merely 15 years of age.Ramchandra Shukla, Hindi Sahitya ka Itihaas (History of Hindi Literature), 1928. During this trip he was influenced by the Bengal Renaissance and decided to bring the genres of social, historical, and Puranic plays and novels into Hindi. This influence reflected in his Hindi translation of the Bengali drama Vidyasundar, three years later, in 1868. Bharatendu devoted his life to the development of Hindi literature. In recognition of his services as a writer, patron and moderniser, the title of \\"Bharatendu\\" was conferred on him at a public meeting by scholars of Kashi in 1880. Reputed literary critic Ram Vilas Sharma refers to the \\"great literary awakening ushered in under Bharatendu's leadership\\" as the \\"second storey of the edifice of renascent Hindi\\", the first being the Indian Rebellion of 1857.Awadesh Pradhan, The Spiritual and Cultural Ethos of Modern Hindi Literature, Prabuddha Bharata, July 2009. Bharatendu Harishchandra made major contributions in the fields of journalism, drama, and poetry. He edited the magazines Kavi Vachan Sudha in 1868 into this magazine he requested Indian people first to use Indian made products or Swadeshi Apnao in March 1874, in 1873 Harishchandra Magazine , Harishchandra Patrika and Bal Vodhini. He was a member of the Chowdhury family of Varanasi belonging to the Agrawal community and his home there is still in use.https://www.firstpost.com/living/remembering-bharatendu-harishchandra-on- hindi-divas-a-man-whose-work-fortified-the-language-7330071.html His ancestors were landlords in Bengal. He had one daughter. He wrote the widely mentioned history of the Agrawal community. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of India gives Bharatendu Harishchandra Awards since 1983 to promote original writings in Hindi mass communication.  Hindu traditionalism  According to Barbara and Thomas R. Metcalf, Bharatendu Harishchandra is considered an influential example of Hindu \\"traditionalist\\" in north India, typifying continuity with received tradition and self-conscious participation with the modern world. He was typical of those Indians who engaged with the Western institutions and learning: They refused to leave authority over religion to Brahmans who were traditionally educated. He used new media, especially publications to shape public opinion. Harishchandra was also typical of revivalists of Hindi Literature which were closely connected with Hindu revivalist movements. He \\"combined pleas for use of Swadeshi articles with demands for replacement of Urdu by Hindi in courts and a ban on cow slaughter\\". He used Vaishnava devotionalism to define a coherent Hindu religion, with a base in the Kashi Dharma Sabha, started in the 1860s by the Maharaja of Benares as a response to more radical Hindu reformist movements. Harishchandra insisted on the value of image worship and interpreted Bhakti as devotion to a single god; this was in response to Orientalist and Christian critiques of Hinduism.  Major works=Drama Bharatendu Harishchandra soon become director, manager, and playwright. He used theatre as a tool to shape public opinion.

Calcutta! is the fifth full-length album by the Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms, released in 2006 by Fat Wreck Chords. It is the band's third studio album to be released on Fat Wreck Chords. In comparison with their previous album The Greatest Story Ever Told, Oh! Calcutta! is considerably faster-paced and more aggressive. It also finds Chris McCaughan and Brendan Kelly sharing vocal duties in an almost duet style, while on previous albums the two had split most of the lead vocals between songs. Brendan Kelly has stated that this is his favorite Lawrence Arms album. Punknews named this album the #1 album of 2000-2009. The album's title demonstrates the band's propensity to juxtapose the twin elements of \\"legitimate\\" literature and philosophy and American pop culture, referencing both the 1969 off-Broadway revue of the same name and a comment made by Mother Teresa that conditions in Chicago's south side depressed her more than the poverty of Calcutta. The title of the song \\"Are You There Margaret? It's Me, God\\" references the book Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. by Judy Blume, while the title \\"Jumping the Shark\\" references a pop culture term describing an episode of Happy Days. \\"Requiem Revisited\\" borrows melodies from the Naked Raygun song, \\"Soldier's Requiem.\\" The whispered lyrics in the beginning of it are taken from the Nomeansno song \\"Brother Rat.\\" The title of \\"Lose Your Illusion 1\\" is a reference to the Guns N' Roses album Use Your Illusion I. The album contains a \\"hidden\\" track after the last song entitled \\"Warped Summer Extravaganza (Major Excellent),\\" a reference to the band's experiences on the Warped Tour.

Their 2018 compilation album We Are the Champions of the World featured 4 additional songs from the album's recording sessions. Quotations In a style that parallels the band's previous album The Greatest Story Ever Told, the inside back cover of the liner notes bears a pair of quotations designed to illustrate the album's juxtaposition of \\"legitimate\\" literature and philosophy with American pop culture: *\\"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport.\\" -from William Shakespeare's King Lear, Act IV, scene i *\\"Billy, you are dealing with the oddity of time travel with the greatest of ease.\\" -Alex Winter in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure Track listing All songs written by The Lawrence Arms #‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äôs Takin‚Äô Names‚Äù‚Äì2:00 #‚ÄúCut It Up‚Äù‚Äì2:13 #‚ÄúGreat Lakes / Great Escapes‚Äù‚Äì2:49 #‚ÄúRecovering the Opposable Thumb‚Äù‚Äì3:05 #‚ÄúBeyond the Embarrassing Style‚Äù‚Äì2:24 #‚ÄúAre You There Margaret?

The Arch of Trajan () is an ancient Roman triumphal arch in Benevento, southern Italy. It was erected in honour of the Emperor Trajan across the Via Appia, at the point where it enters the city. History The arch was built between 114 and 117. In Lombard times, it was incorporated into the southern sector of the city walls and became known as Porta Aurea (\\"Golden Gate\\"). The church of Sant'Ilario, now housing the Videomuseum of the Arch, was built nearby. The arch was studied by Sebastiano Serlio in Renaissance times and drawn by Giovanni Battista Piranesi in the 18th century. It was restored several times due to aging and earthquakes: under Pope Urban VIII, then in 1661, 1713 (after the marble architrave crumbled) and 1792. In 1850, on the occasion of Pope Pius IX's visit to Benevento, it was isolated through demolition of the adjoining buildings. Description Detail of the sacrifice panel in the archway. The arch has a single, barrel-vaulted archway, and is 15.60 m high and 8.60 m wide. Each fa√ßade has four pilasters at the corners of the two side pillars, supporting an entablature. Above the architraves is an attic which, like them, juts out in its central section above the archway. The arch is built in limestone covered by opus quadratum of Parian marble slabs. It has richly sculpted decorations on the two main fa√ßades. The attic features a dedicatory inscription and, at the sides, two bas-relief panels: on the outer sides the left-hand one, only partially preserved, depicted the Homage of the divinities of the province's countryside, and the one on the right the Founding of provincial colonies. On the inner side, on the left, was a depiction of Trajan welcomed by the Capitoline Triad and, on the right, Trajan in the Forum Boarium. Trajan with barbarian princes The frieze on the entablature portrays Trajan's triumphal procession after his victory over Dacia. On each of the pylons, between the corner pilasters, are two panels, one above the other, with scenes and allegories of imperial activities (Trajan's formal arrival at Rome, the concession of Roman citizenship to the auxiliaries, Trajan welcomed by the Senate, the Roman People and the Equestrian order, and others). They are separated by narrower decorative panels depicting Victories offering sacrifices of bulls in the center and Amazons at the top. The pendentives of the archway depict personifications of the Danube and of Mesopotamia on the outer side, and Victory and Military Loyalty on the side facing the city, accompanied by the genii of the Four Seasons. On the arch's keystones are further personifications: Fortune on the outer, and Rome on the city side. The internal fa√ßade of the archway has two wide sculpted panels, portraying scenes of Trajan in Benevento: on the left (from inside the city) is the Sacrifice for the opening of the Via Traiana, with the emperor flanked by lictors, while on the right is the institution of the alimentaria (a beneficent institution created by Trajan to help children in Roman Italy), symbolized by pieces of bread on the table in the center, with personifications of Italian cities with children. The vault has a coffered ceiling, in the center of which is a personification of the Emperor crowned by Victory.

Located on the French Riviera, just to the southwest of Cannes and northeast of Th√©oule-sur-Mer, it had a population of 22,452 in 2017. Townscape It is known for the Ch√¢teau de la Napoule, a fortified castle of the 14th century. In the 20th century, Henry Clews Jr (son of the wealthy New York banker Henry Clews) and his wife Marie Clews, entirely renovated the ch√¢teau which they then inhabited. Henry Clews Jr was a painter and sculptor whose work still fills the castle, which is now run as a non- profit arts foundation by his descendants. The ch√¢teau was once an ancient foundation, then a medieval fortress of the Counts of Villeneuve. Today the Roman Tower (4th century) and the Saracen Tower (11th century) are all that remain of the ch√¢teau that was destroyed during the French Revolution. The ch√¢teau designed by the Clews has cloister, terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, Gothic dining room, and studio. In the basement of a tower at the ch√¢teau the remains of Henry (1876‚Äì1937) and Marie (1878‚Äì1959) are interred in two tombs that Henry designed and sculpted. Transportation Private air transportation for the town (and for nearby Cannes) is provided by Cannes - Mandelieu Airport. The nearest major airport is Nice Cote d'Azur Airport, the second busiest airport in France; it is about 30 minutes drive from the airport to the town. The commune is reached from exit 41 on the autoroute A8. Personalities It is the home of ex MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson. Prince Luis of Orleans-Braganza was born in Mandelieu on June 6, 1938. He is the present head of the Vassouras Branch of the Brazilian Imperial House and de jure Emperor of Brazil (Luis I of Brazil). He is also considered a royal prince of the deposed monarchies of France and Portugal.

It was built in honour of that Emperor after he expanded the port of the city out of his own pocket, improving the docks and the fortifications. It was from here that Trajan departed for the ultimately successful war against the Dacians, an episode which is commemorated in the bas relief of Trajan's column in Rome. The arch was the work of the Roman, a Greek Syrian architect Apollodorus of Damascus, born in Roman Syria. Made from Turkish marble (from the quarries of Marmara Island), it stands 18.5 metres high on a high podium approached by a wide flight of steps. The archway, only 3 m wide, is flanked by pairs of fluted Corinthian columns on pedestals. An attic bears inscriptions. The format is that of the Arch of Titus in Rome, but made taller, so that the bronze figures surmounting it, of Trajan on horseback, his wife Plotina and sister Marciana, would be a landmark for ships approaching Rome's greatest Adriatic port.Marcheworldwide.org The inscriptions, which remain legible, were gilt in bronze, but this gilding, along with the friezes and the statues were taken by the Saracens in 848. Behind the arch and part of the shipyards, the high tower of Gamba was erected in 950, only to be demolished for use in the construction of the Citadel of Ancona (1532). In 1859, the flight of steps was constructed; the gates about a year after. The arch remains in good condition and has recently been restored and made fully operational by the removal of the aforementioned gates and received lighting which raises its profile and enhances its particular position with respect to the historic heart of the city and Guasco hill, where the Cathedral stands.

Based upon the Twin Bonanza, with which it shared key components such as wings, engines, and tail surfaces, but featuring a larger fuselage, it served as the basis for the highly successful King Air series of turboprop aircraft. It is often used as a private aircraft, a utility, or a small commuter airliner. Production ran for 17 years. Design and development The company's Twin Bonanza was reaching the limits of development so Beechcraft decided to develop a design with a larger fuselage and new tail which it designated the Beech 65. Early in development the United States Army which had been a customer of the Twin Bonanza (which it called the L-23 Seminole), ordered 68 aircraft under the designation L-23F. The prototype Beech 65 first flew on August 28, 1958. The Queen Air is a twin-engined nine-seat low-wing cantilever cabin monoplane with a retractable landing gear with a nose wheel. It was initially powered by two Lycoming IGSO-480 six-cylinder, horizontally opposed piston engine. The Model 65 received a Federal Aviation Authority type certificate on February 4, 1959 and the first deliveries were made soon after. On February 8, 1960 a Queen Air achieved a new height record of 34,862 feet. The basic Model 65 was in production until 1967 when the improved Model A65 with a swept rather than vertical tail was introduced. Production continued with further variants introducing pressurisation and turboprop engines. Variants Beechcraft Model 65 Queen Air 65 This is the Queen Air powered by two Lycoming IGSO-480s producing with a 1400-hour TBO. It had a gross weight of with useful loads around . It is easily recognized by its straight unswept tail. Usually referred to as a \\"straight 65\\". Produced from 1960 to 1966. A65 First produced in 1967 the A65 is very similar to the straight 65. The major change was the addition of a swept tail giving the aircraft a much more modern appearance. Available fuel was also increased to 264 gal with the extended wing. The Lyc. IGSO480 engines produced 340 HP @ 3400 rpm with 48 inches of manifold pressure. The gross weight was also increased to 8200 lbs (A65-8200). A few models were produced with a cargo door, next to the airstair door with provided a 48-inch opening. Production ended in 1971. This aircraft was used in Canada by Perimeter Airlines from 1968 to 1998. 70 Introduced in 1968. This aircraft is similar to the A65 in that it is powered by the Lycoming IGSO-480, however it has the longer wing of the 80 series. This allows the 70 to have a greater lifting ability than the 65 but a lower fuel burn than the 80. It is, essentially, an A65 with the B80 wing. Its gross weight is and useful loads can be as high as . Production ended in 1971. 80 First flying on June 22, 1961 and certified on February 20, 1962,Taylor 1971, p. 234. the Queen Air 80 was the first of the Queen Airs to have the more modern swept tail.

Other major changes to the A80 included a redesign of the aircraft nose, and a 500-pound increase in takeoff weight to gross weight. B80 Introduced in 1966 the B80 was to be the final production model. The B80 was by far the longest produced Queen Air with production lasting some 12 years. Its major improvement was the increased gross weight to a . This gave the B80 a useful load of well over . Production ended in 1978. 88 Pressurised Model 88 Queen Air built in 1966 with circular fuselage windows. Introduced in 1965 the model 88 is a pressurized version of the Queen Air. This aircraft featured round cabin windows that make the 88 look quite similar to a 90 series King Air. It also shares the engines and long wing of the B80. Sales were slack due to its higher sales price and lower useful load as compared to the B80. Only 47 examples were ever produced of which two were converted to King Air standard and the model 88 aircraft was removed from production in 1969. The first two models of the King Air's official designation were BE65-90 and BE65-A90 owing to its Queen Air heritage. Excalibur Queen Air 65 Excalibur conversion prior to round-the-world attempt This is a modification performed in the aftermarket by supplemental type certificates (STCs) to the BE65. It resolves the biggest issue of the Queen Air design, the engines. This is accomplished by replacing the rather cantankerous (if operated incorrectly) six-cylinder Lycoming IGSO-480s and Lycoming IGSO-540s, with the far more robust eight-cylinder Lycoming IO-720. This presents the major advantage of not having a gearbox or superchargers to cause maintenance and reliability problems. However the loss of the supercharger does limit the cruising altitude to below fifteen thousand feet. The other advantages gained are the overall increase in power to per engine as well as a gross weight increase in most models. The gross weights are increased to in all the short-wing aircraft (65, A65, 80), in the 70, and 8800 in the other long-wing aircraft (A80, B80, 88). The US Army National Guard installed this modification on some of their aircraft. The Excalibur Queen Air can be recognized by the noticeably smaller engine cowlings and lower-set engines. This STC was originally designed and produced by Ed Swearingen who was well known for his work on the Twin Bonanza, Queen Air, and later Swearingen aircraft (Merlin and Metro). The ownership of this STC has changed hands many times over the years. The current owner is Bemidji Aviation which operates a fleet of Excalibur Queen Airs as well as other aircraft in the charter and freight role in the upper mid-west of the United States.

Used for chariot racing, it was modelled on the Circus Maximus in Rome and other circus buildings throughout the empire. Measuring more than 400 m in length and 30 m of width, it is one of the best preserved examples of the Roman circus. It could house up to 30,000 spectators. History There is no consensus about the circus' dating, as it was built and used for several years before its official dedication. It seems to have been built sometime around 20 BC and inaugurated some 30 years later. It was located far outside the city walls, but close to the road that connected the city to Toledo and C√≥rdoba. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the rise of Christianity in Spain, the circus saw more use than the other Roman structures of M√©rida, since racing was considered less sinful than spectacles performed in the theatre and amphitheater. Modern status M√©rida's circus remains very well preserved. As is true with the Circus Maximus, most circuses's structures have been destroyed over time as the area occupied by them was great and often in very flat land near their respective cities. The M√©rida circus however has kept numerous structures, including the Porta Pompae (\\"main entrance\\"), the Porta Triumphalis (\\"triumph gate\\"), the spina (the longitudinal wall), the tribunal iudicium (\\"tribune of the judges\\"). A museum dedicated to the circus now sits near the middle edge of the circus grounds and allows admittance into the fenced area around the circus remains.

The Tigers took the series in a three-game sweep to advance to the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres. The series was also the last best-of-five ALCS. In 1985, the League Championship Series changed to a best-of-seven format. Due to a strike by major league umpires, the series was played using local and collegiate umpires, with former AL umpire and league supervisor Bill Deegan working home plate for all three games. Background The 1984 American League Championship Series ended in a sweep by the Tigers, however although Games 2 and 3 were both close with Game 2 being decided in extra innings and the Tigers clinched the pennant with a 1-0 victory. It wasn't that surprising given the fact the Royals won 20 fewer games during the season and had won the AL West by a mere three games over both the California Angels and Minnesota Twins. The striking umpires originally scheduled to work the ALCS were Marty Springstead (crew chief), Don Denkinger, Steve Palermo, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and John Shulock (who was not a member of the Major League Umpires Association since he was hired by the AL during the 1979 MLUA strike). Summary=Detroit Tigers vs. Kansas City Royals=Game summaries=Game 1 Tuesday, October 2, 1984, at Royals Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri Game 1 was a blowout in Kansas City, as the Tigers struck first when Lou Whitaker singled to lead off the game off of Bud Black, then scored on Alan Trammell's triple. One out later, Lance Parrish's sacrifice fly made it 2‚Äì0 Tigers. Leadoff home runs by Larry Herndon in the fourth and Trammell in the fifth made it 4‚Äì0 Tigers. In the seventh, Royals' right fielder Pat Sheridan's error on Whitaker's line drive allowed him to reach second, then score on Trammell's single off of Mark Huismann. Tigers' Jack Morris pitched seven innings, allowing only one run in the seventh when Jorge Orta hit a leadoff triple and scored on Darryl Motley's groundout, with Willie Hern√°ndez pitching the final two innings. The Tigers added to their lead in the last two innings off of the Royals' bullpen. Barbaro Garbey led off the eighth with a single off of Huismann and scored on Darrell Evans's double, then Marty Castillo's RBI single made it 7‚Äì1 Tigers. Lance Parrish's leadoff home run in the ninth off of Mike Jones capped the scoring at 8‚Äì1 as the Tigers took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Wednesday, October 3, 1984, at Royals Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri The Tigers took Game 2 in extra innings by a 5‚Äì3 score. In the top of the first, Lou Whitaker reached on an error off of Bret Saberhagen, then back-to-back one-out RBI doubles by Kirk Gibson and Lance Parrish put the Tigers up 2‚Äì0. Gibson's home run in the third made it 3‚Äì0 Tigers. Dan Petry pitched seven innings and gave up two runs (on Jorge Orta's groundout in the fourth after a walk and single and Dane Iorg's RBI single in the seventh with two on), but lost his chance at a win when Willie Hern√°ndez surrendered the tying run in the eighth inning on Hal McRae's RBI double after a leadoff single. Detroit's \\"Senor Smoke\\", Aurelio L√≥pez, held the Royals scoreless in the ninth, tenth and eleventh innings for the win. Johnny Grubb hit a double off Dan Quisenberry in the 11th inning to drive in Darrell Evans and Ruppert Jones for the game winning runs. Game 3 Friday, October 5, 1984, at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan The first postseason game at Tiger Stadium in 12 years was a pitcher's duel between Milt Wilcox and Charlie Leibrandt. Leibrandt pitched a complete game, allowing only one run and three hits, while Wilcox gave up two hits and struck out eight Royals with Willie Hern√°ndez pitching the ninth inning for the save. Marty Castillo's 2nd inning groundout to drove in Chet Lemon for game's lone run as the Tigers completed the three-game sweep and advanced to the World Series. This was their first pennant in 16 years and the ninth in the team's history. Had the ALCS gone the full five games, Game 5 on Sunday October 7, would have been a 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being in prime time. This would have happened because one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was scheduled for that night. Accordingly, ABC planned to broadcast the debates instead of Game 5 in prime time.

Behind the counter, proprietor Andy Karandzieff mans the milkshake machine. Crown Candy Kitchen is restaurant, ice cream fountain, and candy store located on St. Louis Avenue in the Old North St. Louis neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. A St. Louis landmark, it is the oldest operating soda fountain in the metropolitan area, and one of the oldest in the country. The restaurant has an old-fashioned decor with Coca-Cola memorabilia from the 1930s, an antique cash register, and four-person booths. It offers a simple menu with sandwiches and is known for its desserts, especially for its handmade malts or malted milkshakes. It is popular as a lunch destination with office workers in nearby downtown St. Louis. The chocolate is made from decades-old molds, some imported from Holland and Germany.  History  The restaurant was founded in 1913 by two Macedonian immigrants. It was first operated by Harry Karandzieff and his friend Pete Jugaloff, then his son George, and later George's three sons, Andy, Tommy, and Mike Karandzieff. Harry Karandzieff and his friend Pete Jugaloff opened Crown Candy in 1913. Crown Candy has been making ice cream since 1925. A fire caused by a space heater damaged the restaurant on December 25, 1983. Some Coca-Cola memorabilia and $2,000 of candy was destroyed. Business was slowest in the 1970s and it picked up in the 1990s. Crown Candy switched from Coca-Cola to Pepsi in 1999.  Crown Candy challenge  The restaurant offers a challenge to consumers of their trademark malts. Should a person drink five 24-ounce (710 mL) malts or shakes within 30 minutes, they receive the malts for free and have their name inscribed upon a plaque in the store. The record for the five malt challenge is 2 minutes, 29 seconds by Randy Santel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCzLJDXWHI For seven malts, the record is six minutes, by Ben Monson. Since 1913, only about 55 people have successfully completed the Crown Candy Challenge, while several attempt it each week.  In popular culture  The Crown Candy challenge was attempted on the Travel Channel's television series, Man v. Food, by the show's host, Adam Richman, on an episode that aired on 25 February 2009. Richman was only able to finish about four of the five malts. In 2012, it was featured on another Adam Richman-hosted show, Best Sandwich in America, for its \\"Heart-Stopping BLT\\" sandwich, which uses 14 pieces of crispy, kettle-cooked bacon.

A concept album of sorts, it follows a linear storyline and has several songs which call back to or refer to others. The album includes extensive liner notes with footnotes to the lyrics that detail the many literary and pop culture references. Its title is a direct reference to the movie The Greatest Story Ever Told, a 1965 film about the life of Jesus. According to bassist Brendan Kelly, the album's initial reception from Fat Wreck Chords and Fat Mike himself were overwhelmingly negative but changed into appreciation over time.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq8eb/rank-your-records-the-lawrence- arms-brendan-kelly Cultural references In the liner notes and artwork the band members identify themselves under false names and as playing instruments not found on the album, specifically Gordon Shumway on vibraslap, Ivan Nikolayevich on harp and lyre, and Ferdinand Magellan on bassoon. The names are references to history, literature and pop culture: *Ferdinand Magellan, the famous Portuguese explorer who circumnavigated the globe in 1519. *Gordon Shumway, the full name of the fictional alien who was the main character of the 1980s television series ALF. *Ivan Nikolayevich, a character in the novel The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov.

It is a community project of the German Weather Service, the Meteorological Service of Canada, the Danish Meteorological Institute, MeteoSwiss, and the German Bundeswehr. It consists of modules for monitoring weather events, editing point forecasts and viewing meteorological data. An additional batch component is able to render graphical products off-line, these may, for example, be visualized by a web service. Essentially it is a client‚Äîserver system an implemented fully with the programming language Java. NinJo was initiated by the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) and the German army (Bundeswehr Geo Information Service, BGIS) in 2000. Since 2006, NinJo has been used operationally. NinJo is licensed for weather services, organisations and universities not taking part in the development consortium.  Description  NinJo is a client-server system with interactive displays on the client side fed by batch applications implemented on the server. The system is programmed entirely in JAVA and can easily be extended by further layers and applications according to user- specific requirements. The workstation fed by the servers can be installed on different operating systems (e.g. Unix, Linux and Microsoft Windows), avoiding importing the source code onto the specific operating system. The NinJo Server imports a variety of meteorological data, such as METAR reports, weather radar and weather satellite images and numerical weather prediction (NWP) outputs, through dedicated file handling programs, and make them accessible to the client displays. The client is a NinJo workstation which presents data in separate layers. Users can add as many layers to a NinJo scene as they want with all layers show time-synchronised data for the same map area. The layers show geo-referenced data, not fix images, so the screen display is always done directly from the data and interactive probing using the mouse is giving the values of the original data, not a scale extracted one. The data are stored in native format, rather than stored in a common internal format, avoiding degradation in zooms and always keeping the full details and resolution of the original data. The layers are independent, can be added and removed from the scenes separately, and be set visible or invisible. Layers can be arranged in any order the users want enabling them to arrange all data types according to their specific needs. Scenes can be set for: *Visualisation of weather products *Monitoring the state of data input *Production of weather warnings *Interactive editing of texts *Configuration of NinJo batch products Different tools are available for enhancing or interrogating the displays. For example, it is possible to do vertical cross-sections in a layered scene, extracting the vertical structure of NWP or radars data.

It was established in 2001 to provide a place for liberals to debate how they could meet the challenge of religious extremist domination of political life, which has been a consequence of Bahrain's democratization process; Shia and Sunni extremists have been the best organized and most popular political parties and have quickly filled the new political space opened by reforms. Al Muntada has since met monthly to debate the most recent political issues. It is chaired by Adel Fakhro, the vice chairman is Gulf News columnist and South Asian specialist, Dr Abdullah Al Madani, and other leading members include journalist Sawsan Al Sha‚Äôer and Dr Ahmad Juma, the head of Al Meethaq. The major challenge facing Bahraini liberals is their small number, while Islamist parties such as Asalah and Al Wefaq are mass organisations. Al Muntada does not pretend to have the same scale of support, but has sought to hold meetings to address issues of interest to a growing portion of the population. Because of the number of liberals, the group has not sought to become another political party but tries to use the new political space in civil society to influence opinion and policy. In an Arab region where deference to religious figures is the norm, Al Muntada is unapologetically secular, giving voice to liberals‚Äô aspirations and concerns. Its spokesmen have condemned the \\"dark forces\\" inside the parliament that want to \\"promote the same ideology of the Taliban\\". Traditionally Bahrain's liberals had looked to the government to be their protector, and in some ways the government has signaled its intention to safeguard personal freedoms in the new political framework by appointing sixteen members of the liberal Al Meethaq party to the Consultative Council, Bahrain's appointed upper chamber of parliament, to counter the dominance of Islamists in the lower chamber. However, liberals have expressed the strongest concern after the government has signaled that it will avoid confrontation with Islamist MPs over issues such as the sale of alcohol during Ramadan, and other personal freedoms. Among the intiaitives launched by Al Muntada is a campaign to protect personal freedoms, We Have A Right, with affiliate organisations, Bahrain Youth Society, National Liberal Thought Society, Bahrain Women's Society, National Action Charity Society, the Future Forum Society and the Alumni Club, spearheading the task force. The group has criticised legislative proposals put forward by Ali Mattar MP for the introduction of Sharia Law. Dr Abdullah Al Madani told the Gulf Daily News \\"Could you have ever imagined in your lives that someone in Bahrain could ever propose a law to cut off hands?\\" Within the elected Chamber of Deputies Al Muntada is known to be close to the Economists Bloc and to a lesser extent, the Democratic Bloc. Islamists have responded to the challenge posed by Al Muntada by ignoring it initially and then seeking to portray it as a pro- government, pro-American and elitist.

The group was active between 1993-2005 before taking a hiatus for 4 years. The group reformed in 2009 and is currently active. Over the course of the band's history they were most successful with European audiences, though are based and primarily toured in the United States. Biography Innovators of the then-emerging sadcore movement in indie rock in the 1990s, the eclectic rock group consisted of guitarist Jonathan Kroll, drummer Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo, vocalist Troy Von Balthazar and bassist A Frank G. They formed in Honolulu in the early 1990s and moved to Los Angeles in 1992 because guitarist Jonathan Kroll was attending art school there. Shortly after the move, they were signed to Amphetamine Reptile Records in 1993, based on a demo tape the band had submitted. Chokebore released their debut single \\"Nobody / Throats to Hit\\" and their first full-length Motionless later that year. Their changing tempos and moody outbursts were unlike many other AmRep bands at the time, but their more furious and quicker paced moments aligned themselves just enough. They toured with Guzzard and Today Is The Day as well as with other more well-known like-minded bands, including the Butthole Surfers, Samiam, Girls Against Boys and Nirvana on their last 10 American shows. They earned a strong following in Europe, in support of 1995's Anything Near Water and A Taste for Bitters, the latter of which was recorded and engineered by Peter Deimel at Black Box studio in France. 1998's Black Black was also recorded there, and represents a portrait of the band's darker side; loneliness, depression, death and sadness recurring themes. The album was released on AmRep's European offshoot Boomba Records, but wasn't released stateside for another year, finally finding a home on Unwound's Punk In My Vitamins label. The band released It's a Miracle in 2002, which saw the band slightly less concerned with strict cohesion of the aesthetics and some songs were looser than on past releases (\\"Ciao L.A.\\" is perhaps the most straightforward rock track the band has ever put to tape). The live album A Part From Life was released in 2003 and the band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2005. During the following years, singer/guitar player Troy Von Balthazar recorded two solo albums in Europe, drummer Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo toured with Christian Death 1334 and guitarist Jonathan Kroll started his \\"slow and wordless\\" guitar project \\"A Newborn Riot Of Dreams\\". On November 18, 2009, the band announced their reunion via homepage and newsletter: \\"We are happy to announce that Chokebore are getting back together again to play a handful of shows around Europe!\\" After a small series of European shows and festivals in 2010, Chokebore returned in October 2011 with the release of the five-track vinyl EP Falls Best, followed by a European tour in October/November 2011.

The dignity arose from the honorary consulships awarded in the late Roman Empire, and survived until the early 12th century. It was often conferred upon the rulers of the south Italian principalities. In Italian documents the term was sometimes Latinised as hypatus or ypatus, and in Italian historiography one finds ipato. The feminine form of the term was hypatissa (). The creation of ordinary consuls in Late Antiquity was irregular, and after their division in 395, the two halves of the Roman Empire tended to divide the two consulships between them; the office, which had become both effectively honorary and quite expensive, sometimes lay vacant for years. The emperors were often ordinary consuls, and after 541, with the exception of the emperor, who assumed the office on his accession, no ordinary consuls were appointed. From that point on, only honorary consulships were granted, and the title declined much in prestige.. Throughout the 6th to 9th centuries there is ample sigillographic evidence of functionaries bearing the title, usually attached to mid-level administrative and fiscal posts. In the late 9th-century hierarchy, however, as related by the Klƒìtorologion of Philotheos, it was one of the lower dignities intended for \\"bearded men\\" (i.e. non-eunuchs), ranking between the spatharios and the strat≈çr. Its badge of office, whose award also conferred the dignity, was a diploma. In the Escorial Taktikon, written , the hypatos appears to be a regular office instead of an honorary dignity, endowed with judicial duties according to Nicolas Oikonomides. In the 11th century, the title rose again in importance, apparently outranking the pr≈çtospatharios, but disappeared entirely by the mid-12th century. The title was often conferred to the rulers of south Italian city-states of the Tyrrhenian coast, which recognised Byzantine authority in the 9th through 11th centuries. Eventually, with the waning of Byzantine power in the region, these rulers took on more familiar Latin titles like consul and dux, modern duke. The most famous hypatoi were those of Gaeta. John I of Gaeta won the title patrikios from the Byzantine emperor, as a reward for defeating the Saracens. In Gaeta, the feminine title hypatissa () was replaced by do√∫kissa (Italian: ducissa) during the reign of Docibilis II of Gaeta and his wife Orania, in the first half of the 10th century. The title was the root of the titles anthypatos (\\"vice-hypatos\\", the translation of proconsul) and dishypatos (\\"twice hypatos\\"), as well as the office of hypatos t≈çn philosoph≈çn (, \\"chief of the philosophers\\"), a title given to the head of the imperial university of Constantinople in the 11th-14th centuries.

His work can be described as intense and original, lo-fi pop music. Biography Before working solo Troy Von Balthazar (TvB) became famous in the 1990s as the singer and songwriter of L.A./Hawaii cult band Chokebore. They toured all around the world, including 10 shows supporting Nirvana on their final tour, and released 5 LPs, landmarks in independent rock's history. Expanding on the slow, sad landscapes of Chokebore's later works, Troy Von Balthazar (TvB) first released a series of homemade CD-R EPs under the moniker \\"B. Balthazar\\", performing all instruments (mainly acoustic and electric guitars, drums, vocals and taped samples) himself. His solo debut, the Sweet Receiver EP (2001), was followed in 2002 by the Red Spider EP, . These two EPs were re-released together on the B. Balthazar MCD, which was sold exclusively at shows during Balthazar's first European tour in 2003. This tour earned him increasing support in the European indie rock community, allowing him to sign to French record label Olympic Disk. Reverting to the moniker he used with Chokebore, he released the self-titled Troy Von Balthazar EP in November 2004 on Olympic Disk. After a French tour supporting this release, he flew back to Los Angeles to record his debut album at Elliott Smith's \\"New Monkey\\" studio. Troy Von Balthazar performed, recorded and mixed all the tracks himself, with the exception of some female vocals contributed by French musician Adeline Fargier. The Troy Von Balthazar LP was released by Olympic Disk on October 10, 2005. An extensive European tour followed, spanning most of the year 2006. In early 2007, Balthazar returned to Los Angeles to record his second album, this time backed by the band The Black Pine. During the fall of 2007 he toured Germany, Austria and Switzerland with the German rock band Tocotronic, supporting the German release of his self-titled album Troy Von Balthazar by Sinnbus on October 26, 2007. The same year, he published his first book titled \\"3 Girls\\", which was distributed via Sinnbus. In 2009, Troy put together the TVB 3 EP, a collection of three EPs comprising previously released EPs Sweet Receiver and Red Spider, along with several new or previously unreleased songs. In October 2009, the TVB 3 EP was released in vinyl format as The TVB LP by Czech label Silver Rocket Records. Onstage in Berlin, 2009 In 2010, he and his former bandmates reactivated Chokebore to play European shows during the month of February, then some festivals during the summer. On August 27, 2010, French label Third Side Records released the Troy Von Balthazar single Dots and Hearts as a digital download, that was soon followed by the release on September 13 of Troy Von Balthazar's second full-length album How to Live on Nothing. In October 2012 the French label \\"Vicious Circle Records\\" released his third studio album \\"...is with the demon\\" to wide critical acclaim. That year TvB also recorded music for the movie \\"This Aint California\\" a film about German skateboarders behind the Berlin wall in the 1980s, the French film \\"Des Morceaux de Moi\\" (release date February 13, 2013), and the French film \\"Cover us\\" in which a ghost sings the Troy Von Balthazar song \\"Wings\\" to a boy who discovers him. In 2013 he released his 2nd book \\"This poem does not please her\\". In 2015 Troy Von Balthazar (TvB) teamed up with Jason Lytle (Grandaddy), Kenneth Stringfellow (The Posies, R.E.M., Mercury Rev) and 11 chamber orchestra musicians to perform a tribute to Elliott Smith. \\"The Color Bar Experience\\" plays Elliott Smiths full Figure 8 album with the orchestra and their voices. Concerts were played across France to rave review and a full live album was made of their performance on Radio 1 in Paris. In 2016 TvB released his new album \\"Knights of Something\\" worldwide to critical acclaim, with record companies: Vicious Circle Records in France, Siluh Records in Austria, New High Recordings in the US, and Donuts Pop in Japan. His fourth studio album, recorded in Berlin and the South of France using a combination of an old Tascam 388, tape machine and Pro Tools, a bunch of amazing guitar pedals, and vintage microphones. \\"TvB has captured lo-fi songwriting and recording at its best, stream of consciousness music structures and intense sweeping lyricism that boggles the mind and attaches to the heart and soul of the listener. TvB is an artist who has actually produces his own powerful sound, lets call it ‚ÄúThe TvB sound‚Äù.\\" Troy is currently preparing for tour supporting \\"Knights of Something\\", writing his fifth album, and his third book. Live performances Troy's one man band live performances incorporate looping techniques and several distortion techniques. Many people have commented that his live performances, when performed in this fashion, are equal in strength to his studio recordings and his lo-fi analog and intimate recording style.

It was owned by a variety of owners including D.K. Ulrich and Doug Bawel.  1970s‚Äì1980s  The car started in 1971 at what turned out to be the only Winston Cup race at Smoky Mountain Raceway as the No. 41 Ford owned and driven by Ulrich, who finished 29th out of 30 cars for heating problems on the 4th lap. Ulrich ran full-time for a couple of years, but normally he stepped aside and let other drivers race for him. During his tenure as an owner, he employed many younger drivers. Sterling Marlin, Tim Richmond, Morgan Shepherd, and Mark Martin all went on to successful careers after piloting Ulrich's car. In 1987, Ulrich noticed a young short track driver from California named Ernie Irvan, who qualified 20th in a Dale Earnhardt-sponsored car for a race that Ulrich didn't make. Ulrich put the aggressive young Irvan in his car for three races that year, with Irvan's partner Marc Reno as crew chief. When Ulrich was able to get Kroger as a full-time sponsor for the team, he fielded the car full-time in 1988 with Irvan competing for NASCAR Winston Cup Series Rookie of the Year in the No. 2 Chevrolet/Pontiac, finishing 59 points behind Ken Bouchard for Rookie of the Year. In 1989, Irvan posted 4-top ten finishes and ending the season 22nd in points, three better than the previous year. Unfortunately, Kroger decided not to renew its contract, and Irvan had no choice but to leave the team. Ulrich was able to get several different sponsorships together for 1990, and the team ran most of the races.  1990s  A Jasper Motorsports Ford Thunderbird on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum. The car returned full-time for 1991 as the No. 55 Pontiac sponsored by Jasper Engines, based in Jasper, Indiana. The team's original plan was a Winston Cup rookie campaign for popular USAC veteran and Indianapolis 500 starter Rich Vogler, but he perished while leading a USAC event at the Winchester Speedway in Indiana in July 1990. Their next choice was Wisconsin's Ted Musgrave, who narrowly missed Rookie of the Year honors to Bobby Hamilton. During the 1992 and 1993 NASCAR seasons, Ulrich formed a partnership with Ray DeWitt to form RaDiUs Motorsports which continued with Musgrave behind the wheel. During the 1992 season, the team ran various makes from General Motors before switching to Ford halfway through the year. In 1994 Musgrave left for Roush Racing and Ulrich and DeWitt ended their partnership. DeWitt formed a new team with the RaDiUS name and No. 55 while Ulrich retained the Jasper sponsorship on the newly renumbered No. 77, with Doug Bawel, an executive from Jasper Engines & Transmissions, became a business partner with Ulrich, the team being renamed Jasper Motorsports with veteran journeyman Greg Sacks handling the driving chores as well as a major co-sponsorship from USAir. Jasper Engines & Transmissions co-sponsored the team for the 1995 season, with the car originally piloted by rookie Davy Jones and later Bobby Hillin Jr.. After the season, Bawel bought the entire team from Ulrich and started a partnership with Jasper salesmen Mark Wallace and Mark Harrah. Hillin continued to drive the car for 1996, and the first part of 1997, before being replaced by Robert Pressley and Morgan Shepherd. Pressley was full-time for 1998, during which he had a then-career-best finish of 3rd at Texas. 1999 was a tumultuous year for the team, struggling with qualifying and finishing 39th in points. For the 2000 season, the team began using Penske engines and hired Ryan Pemberton as crew chief. Change made a huge difference as Pressley finished 25th in points the next two years, finishing 2nd at the 2001 Tropicana 400 at Chicagoland Speedway.  2000s  Pressley, although picking up a few top-tens during his tenure with Jasper, struggled with consistency, even with his successful pairing with Pemberton. Therefore, Pressley and Jasper parted ways after the season, and former sprint car champion Dave Blaney was tabbed to replace him. But Blaney, while competitive in some races also struggled with consistency and was gone at the end of 2003. Boris Said drove a No. 67 car on road courses and as a teammate to Blaney in 2002, finishing a best of 8th at Watkins Glen. The car is featured in the widely popular video game NASCAR Racing 2003 Season. At the end of the year, Wallace sold his share of the team, and Roger Penske, who was already providing engines and support to the Jasper team, took his place. The team got a new sponsor in Kodak, as well as a new driver in rookie Brendan Gaughan and a new manufacturer in Dodge. Despite grabbing 4 top-10 finishes, Gaughan was replaced to the shock of fans by another rookie, Travis Kvapil. In his first year in the Cup circuit, he finished 32nd in points with two top-10 finishes. When the season came to a close, it was announced the No. 77 car would not run the 2006 season, as Penske would go back to fielding two cars in his own team. Not long after the announcement, the team shut down and sold its owner's points to Bill Davis, who fielded car No. 55 for Michael Waltrip for the 2006 season. After 2006, Waltrip bought the 55 team and Michael Waltrip Racing became a full-time Nextel Cup team.

Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793-1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), pp. 266-270; also Myra Chepack, \\"Markham Fair President 1910: James McCreight Armstrong,\\" Markham Fair official website. With over 700 volunteers working on more than 70 committees, Markham Fair is the largest community-based volunteer organization in Canada. The fair and fairgrounds are owned by the Markham and East York Agricultural Society. The fair occurs annually on the weekend before Canadian Thanksgiving, and hosts upwards of 80,000 attendees. Approximately 3,000 exhibitors enter more than 12,000 items, which are judged and put on display during the fair. Promoting excellence through competition in this way makes fairs unique in comparison to other events. Agricultural societies used to meet on a regular basis to discuss various concepts of agricultural improvement such as livestock development and increased grain yields. Often the society would collectively purchase a bull or seed grain, which would be made available to members only. The fall fair would then be an opportunity for the farmers to compete by showing off the fruits of their labour. Due to increased technology and rapid communication, agricultural societies no longer find it necessary to provide this service, but the Markham Fair continues to create the forum known as the fall fair, providing the community with a showcase for talents and products in a friendly competitive spirit. As well as the competitive displays, the community is further brought together to enjoy various forms of entertainment such as horse pull, demolition derby, tractor pull, midway rides and displays of farm animals. The 2020 Markham Fair has been cancelled due to safety concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Fairgrounds The fairgrounds are located in northern Markham at the northeast corner of McCowan Road and Elgin Mills Road and sits on of former farm land (once farmed by Jonathan 'John' Williamson) and Stuart and Trevor Watson. The site has several buildings used to house trade shows and other events. A 1/2-mile track and 4 wood stables are used to store animals. To the east of the fairgrounds is Little Rouge Creek. The original fairground was located at the present day Markham Village Library at southeast corner of Markham Road and Highway 7 (farmland of Robert Goodfellow Armstrong and Wellington Hotel). The fair moved to the current site in 1977, as the original fairground area grew less agricultural. The current library building was built to mimic the shape of the old Agricultural Hall that once stood at the site (along what is now Highway 7 on the south side from Washington Street to Jerman Street). A fire in 1916 burned down the new hall, ice rink and other buildings (barns). Only the rink was rebuilt (years later in 1963) on the site and currently part of the Markham Village Community Centre. The area where the track once sat are now homes with Reeves Park along Highway 48. Events Many shows and events are showcased throughout the duration of the fair. In previous years these shows have included: * Agri-food Tent Shows (cooking shows) * Gymnastics demonstration * Freestyle Moto-Cross (FMX) Bike Demonstration * Demolition Derby * Tractor Pull * Sheep Shearing Demonstration Other events A number of local events use the fairgrounds outside of the fair days including home shows, trade shows and warehouse sales. Midway World's Finest Shows runs the midway located at the West Gate of the fairgrounds.  History The earliest recorded fair held in Markham was in 1857 at the fairgrounds then located on the South East corner of the junction of Highways 7 (Wellington Street) and 48. Prior to that, fairs were held in Unionville, Ontario in 1855 and also in Markham. In 1865 Captain William Armstrong granted of his land for the fairgrounds to build several buildings (grandstand, track, stalls, ice rink, exhibition hall) including a single floor agricultural hall. A new two floor hall, ticket office and rink was planned in 1894 and in 1916 a fire destroyed those buildings and were later replaced with a larger Agricultural Hall (Crystal Palace) to house the fair. The massive brick by rink would serve as an early recreation centre.https://www.markhamfair.ca/about/100-years-ago-1917 In 1963 the fair buildings were demolished to make way for the Markham Village Cenotaph and Community Centre (including indoor ice rink). In 1977 the Fair relocated to its current site where the four-day fair is held annually on the weekend preceding Canadian Thanksgiving. The Markham Village Library was built in 1980-1981 (on land bought by the then Town of Markham in 1975) now occupies the site of the old fairgrounds and mimics the barrel vault design of the old Agricultural Hall. Board of directors The society is an Ontario corporation that owns and operates the fair and its properties. It is governed by a board of 24 directors, who are elected at each annual meeting for a three-year period, and six junior directors (between the ages of 18-26) who are elected annually for a one-year period. All directors are elected by members of the society who attend the annual meeting. From among the directors, the President (Chair) and two vice-presidents are elected following the annual meeting, along with a Treasurer, General Manager, and Secretary. Mission The mission of the society is to encourage an awareness of agriculture and to promote improvements in the quality of life of persons living in an agricultural community by: * researching and developing programs to meet the needs of the community; * holding annual agricultural exhibitions featuring competitions for which prizes may be awarded; * promoting the conservation of natural resources; * encouraging the beautification of the community; and by * supporting and providing facilities to encourage activities to enrich the community In addition, there are over 750 volunteers involved with the operations, which fill the board seats and form some 75 committees, which share administrative duties and the Fair operating procedures.

It is mostly given over to sheep-farming, and situated on the southern edge of Exmoor. An account of life in Morebath in the 16th century can be read in The Voices of Morebath: Reformation and Rebellion in an English Village by Eamon Duffy (published in 2001 by Yale University Press, ). Then, as now, Morebath was populated by no more than 300 people, drawn from some thirty families, living and working on the land. During the often turbulent period of the Reformation, its inhabitants relied on the guidance of their priest, Christopher Trychay, Vicar of Morebath from 1520 to 1574. His detailed hand-written records were transcribed by the Rev. J. Erskine Binney, and published by James G. Commin of Exeter in 1904 as a separate volume in the Devon Notes & Queries series, under the title The Accounts of the Wardens of the Parish of Morebath, Devon. They provide an insight into the life of this small English community. The church is dedicated to St. George. The village was formerly served by two railway stations. Morebath railway station (initially opened in 1873 as \\"Morebath and Bampton\\") on the Devon and Somerset Railway was actually nearer to Shillingford, and about a mile-and-a-half from Morebath itself. Morebath Junction Halt, which opened in 1928, was a single-platform halt set among fields in the valley beyond Ashtown Farm, and had no access road, though there was a footpath to it from Ashtown, which extended along the edge of fields to Chilpark on the B3190, close to the main part of the village. It was served by the Exe Valley Railway, as well as the Devon and Somerset line, and therefore had a better service than Morebath railway station: it was also much closer to Morebath village itself. Both stations closed in 1966. The actress Caroline Quentin resides in the village with her family.

Cokin is a French manufacturer of optical filters for photography. The system allows filters such as rectangular graduated neutral density filters which are versatile in use. History Cokin Creative Suite Cokin are particularly noted for their \\"Creative Filter System\\". It was invented by photographer Jean Coquin and introduced in 1978. Based primarily around square filters, these require a holder which is attached to the lens via a simple adapter ring of the appropriate size. Unlike screw-thread circular filters, which are each tied to lenses of a specific diameter, those in the system can be used with any lens, provided they are large enough to cover it sufficiently. (Only the adapter ring may need changing). Production The system includes a wide range of filters including color correction, plain and coloured graduated filters, diffraction, diffusion and polarizers. The material is a polymer, CR-39 sometimes advertised as \\"organic glass\\". Cokin produce various differently-sized versions of the Creative Filter System. The smallest is \\"A\\" (\\"Amateur\\", 67mm wide). The larger \\"P\\" (\\"Professional\\", 84mm wide) system covers cases where \\"A\\" filters are too small to cover the lens (or would cause problems at wider angles). The still-larger \\"X-Pro\\" filters are 130mm wide. The \\"A\\" and \\"P\\" sizes in particular are de facto standards, with many other manufacturers producing compatible filters and holders.

The A.K. Seaver Professor Emeritus of Literary Arts & Comparative Literature at Brown University, Gander won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 2019 for Be With and is chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Early life Born in the Mojave Desert, Forrest Gander grew up in Virginia, where he and his two sisters were raised by their single mother, an elementary school teacher. The four shared a two-room apartment in Annandale. Gander's estranged father ran The Mod Scene, a bar on Bleecker St. in Greenwich Village, New York City. With his mother and sisters, Gander began to travel extensively on summer road trips around the United States. The traveling, which never stopped, came to inform his interest in landscapes, languages, and cultures. Forrest and his two sisters, Karin and Lisa, were adopted by Walter J. Gander soon after Walter Gander's marriage to their mother, nee Ruth Clare Cockerille. Gander earned college degrees in geology, a subject referenced frequently in both his poems and essays, and in English literature. His work has been linked to ecopoetics and ecology.  Career  A writer of multiple genres, Gander is noted for his many collaborations with other artists, including Eiko and Koma. He is a United States Artists Rockefeller Fellow and the recipient of fellowships from the Library of Congress, the National Endowment for the Arts, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, The Whiting Foundation, and the Howard Foundation. In 2017, he was elected as a Chancellor to the Academy of American Poets and in 2019, he was awarded The Pulitzer Prize in poetry. He taught at Providence College and at Harvard University before becoming the Adele Kellenberg Seaver Professor of Literary Arts and Comparative Literatures at Brown University in Rhode Island. Gander was married to the poet CD Wright. Together they raised a son, the artist-craftsman Brecht Wright Gander. Her sudden death in 2016 precipitated Gander's book Be With. Writing and translation David Kirby, writing in The New York Times Book Review notes that, \\"It isn't long before the ethereal quality of these poems begins to remind you of similar effects in the work of T.S. Eliot and the 17th century Anglo-Welsh mystic Henry Vaughan....In the midst of such questioning, the only reality is the poet's unflinchingly curious mind.\\" Noting the frequency and particularity of Gander's references to ecology and landscape, Robert Hass, former U.S. Poet Laureate, calls him \\"a Southern poet of a relatively rare kind, a restlessly experimental writer.\\" Gander's book Core Samples from the World was a finalist for 2012 Pulitzer Prize and the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award. The Pulitzer citation notes that Core Samples from the World is \\"A compelling work that explores cross-cultural tensions in the world and digs deeply to identify what is essential in human experience.\\" With Australian poet-activist John Kinsella, Gander wrote the cross-genre book Redstart: an Ecological Poetics. Be With, published in 2018 by New Directions, was awarded the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in poetry and was longlisted for the 2018 National Book Award. It is an elegiac collection of poetry and testament to his anguish over the death of his wife. Gander eventually decided to stop reading publicly from the collection so as not to \\"perform his grief.\\" The subjects of Gander's formally innovative essays range from snapping turtles to translation to literary hoaxes. His critical essays have appeared in The Nation, Boston Review, and The New York Times Book Review. In 2008, New Directions published As a Friend, Gander's novel of a gifted man, a land surveyor, whose impact on those around him provokes an atmosphere of intense self-examination and eroticism. In The New York Times Book Review, Jeanette Winterson praised As a Friend as \\"a strange and beautiful novel.... haunting and haunted.\\" As a Friend has been published in translation in half a dozen foreign editions. In 2014, New Directions released Gander's second novel The Trace, about a couple who, researching the last journey of Civil War writer Ambrose Bierce, find themselves lost in the Chihuahua Desert. The New Yorker called it a \\"carefully crafted novel of intimacy and isolation.\\" And in The Paris Review, Robyn Creswell commented that \\"Gander‚Äôs landscapes are lyrical and precise (\\"raw gashed mountains, gnarly buttes of andesite\\"), and his study of a marriage on the rocks is as empathetic as it is unsparing.\\"\\\\ Gander is a translator who has edited several anthologies of poetry from Spain, Mexico, and Latin America. In addition, Gander has translated distinct volumes by Mexican poets Pura L√≥pez Colom√©, Coral Bracho (for which he was a PEN Translation Prize finalist for Firefly Under the Tongue), Valerie Mejer Caso, and Alfonso D'Aquino, another poet connected with ecopoetry. With Kyoko Yoshida, Gander translated Spectacle & Pigsty: Selected Poems of Kiwao Nomura (OmniDawn, 2011), winner of the 2012 Best Translated Book Award; in 2016, New Directions published Alice Iris Red Horse, selected poems of Yoshimasu Gozo, edited by Gander. The second book of his translations, with Kent Johnson, of Bolivian poet Jaime Saenz, The Night (Princeton, 2007), received a PEN Translation Award. Gander's critically acclaimed translations of the Chilean Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda are included in The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems (City Lights, 2004). In 2016, Copper Canyon Press released \\"Then Come Back: the Lost Neruda,\\" a bilingual edition of Gander's translations of twenty previously unknown and unseen Neruda poems. In 2018, Gander became a reviewer with New York Journal of Books. Collaborations and editorial work Gander has worked with artists Ann Hamilton and Gus Van Sant, photographers Lucas Foglia, Sally Mann, Graciela Iturbide, Peter Lindbergh, Michael Flomen, and Raymond Meeks, ceramic artists Ashwini Bhat and Richard Hirsch, dancers Eiko & Koma, painter Tjibbe Hooghiemstra, glass artist Michael Rogers, musicians Vic Chesnutt and Brady Earnhart, and others. Along with CD Wright, Gander was a co-editor of Lost Roads Publishers for twenty years, soliciting, editing, and publishing books by more than thirty writers, including Michael Harper, Kamau Brathwaite, Arthur Sze, Fanny Howe, Steve Stern, Josie Foo, Frances Mayes, and Zuleyka Benitez.  Personal life  Gander lives now in Petaluma, California with artist Ashwini Bhat.

Fermat's theorem is a theorem in real analysis, named after Pierre de Fermat. By using Fermat's theorem, the potential extrema of a function \\\\displaystyle f, with derivative \\\\displaystyle f', are found by solving an equation in \\\\displaystyle f'. Fermat's theorem gives only a necessary condition for extreme function values, as some stationary points are inflection points (not a maximum or minimum). The function's second derivative, if it exists, can sometimes be used to determine whether a stationary point is a maximum or minimum. Statement One way to state Fermat's theorem is that, if a function has a local extremum at some point and is differentiable there, then the function's derivative at that point must be zero. In precise mathematical language: :Let f\\\\colon (a,b) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} be a function and suppose that x_0 \\\\in (a,b) is a point where f has a local extremum. If f is differentiable at \\\\displaystyle x_0, then f'(x_0) = 0. Another way to understand the theorem is via the contrapositive statement: if the derivative of a function at any point is not zero, then there is not a local extremum at that point. Formally: :If f is differentiable at x_0 \\\\in (a,b), and f'(x_0) eq 0, then x_0 is not a local extremum of f.'' Corollary The global extrema of a function f on a domain A occur only at boundaries, non-differentiable points, and stationary points. If x_0 is a global extremum of f, then one of the following is true: * boundary: x_0 is in the boundary of A * non-differentiable: f is not differentiable at x_0 * stationary point: x_0 is a stationary point of f Extension In higher dimensions, exactly the same statement holds; however, the proof is slightly more complicated. The complication is that in 1 dimension, one can either move left or right from a point, while in higher dimensions, one can move in many directions. Thus, if the derivative does not vanish, one must argue that there is some direction in which the function increases ‚Äì and thus in the opposite direction the function decreases. This is the only change to the proof or the analysis. The statement can also be extended to differentiable manifolds. If f : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is a differentiable function on a manifold M, then its local extrema must be critical points of f, in particular points where the exterior derivative df is zero. Applications Fermat's theorem is central to the calculus method of determining maxima and minima: in one dimension, one can find extrema by simply computing the stationary points (by computing the zeros of the derivative), the non-differentiable points, and the boundary points, and then investigating this set to determine the extrema. One can do this either by evaluating the function at each point and taking the maximum, or by analyzing the derivatives further, using the first derivative test, the second derivative test, or the higher-order derivative test. Intuitive argument Intuitively, a differentiable function is approximated by its derivative ‚Äì a differentiable function behaves infinitesimally like a linear function a+bx, or more precisely, f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0). Thus, from the perspective that \\"if f is differentiable and has non-vanishing derivative at x_0, then it does not attain an extremum at x_0,\\" the intuition is that if the derivative at x_0 is positive, the function is increasing near x_0, while if the derivative is negative, the function is decreasing near x_0. In both cases, it cannot attain a maximum or minimum, because its value is changing. It can only attain a maximum or minimum if it \\"stops\\" ‚Äì if the derivative vanishes (or if it is not differentiable, or if one runs into the boundary and cannot continue). However, making \\"behaves like a linear function\\" precise requires careful analytic proof. More precisely, the intuition can be stated as: if the derivative is positive, there is some point to the right of x_0 where f is greater, and some point to the left of x_0 where f is less, and thus f attains neither a maximum nor a minimum at x_0. Conversely, if the derivative is negative, there is a point to the right which is lesser, and a point to the left which is greater. Stated this way, the proof is just translating this into equations and verifying \\"how much greater or less\\". The intuition is based on the behavior of polynomial functions. Assume that function f has a maximum at x0, the reasoning being similar for a function minimum. If \\\\displaystyle x_0 \\\\in (a,b) is a local maximum then, roughly, there is a (possibly small) neighborhood of \\\\displaystyle x_0 such as the function \\"is increasing before\\" and \\"decreasing after\\"This intuition is only correct for continuously differentiable \\\\left(C^1\\\\right) functions, while in general it is not literally correct--a function need not be increasing up to a local maximum: it may instead be oscillating, so neither increasing nor decreasing, but simply the local maximum is greater than any values in a small neighborhood to the left or right of it. See details in the pathologies. \\\\displaystyle x_0. As the derivative is positive for an increasing function and negative for a decreasing function, \\\\displaystyle f' is positive before and negative after \\\\displaystyle x_0. \\\\displaystyle f' doesn't skip values (by Darboux's theorem), so it has to be zero at some point between the positive and negative values. The only point in the neighbourhood where it is possible to have \\\\displaystyle f'(x) = 0 is \\\\displaystyle x_0. The theorem (and its proof below) is more general than the intuition in that it doesn't require the function to be differentiable over a neighbourhood around \\\\displaystyle x_0. It is sufficient for the function to be differentiable only in the extreme point. Proof= Proof 1: Non-vanishing derivatives implies not extremum  Suppose that f is differentiable at x_0 \\\\in (a,b), with derivative K, and assume without loss of generality that K > 0, so the tangent line at x_0 has positive slope (is increasing). Then there is a neighborhood of x_0 on which the secant lines through x_0 all have positive slope, and thus to the right of x_0, f is greater, and to the left of x_0, f is lesser. The schematic of the proof is: * an infinitesimal statement about derivative (tangent line) at x_0 implies * a local statement about difference quotients (secant lines) near x_0, which implies * a local statement about the value of f near x_0. Formally, by the definition of derivative, f'(x_0) = K means that :\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x_0+\\\\varepsilon)-f(x_0)}{\\\\varepsilon} = K. In particular, for sufficiently small \\\\varepsilon (less than some \\\\varepsilon_0), the quotient must be at least K/2, by the definition of limit. Thus on the interval (x_0-\\\\varepsilon_0,x_0+\\\\varepsilon_0) one has: :\\\\frac{f(x_0+\\\\varepsilon)-f(x_0)}{\\\\varepsilon} > K/2; one has replaced the equality in the limit (an infinitesimal statement) with an inequality on a neighborhood (a local statement). Thus, rearranging the equation, if \\\\varepsilon > 0, then: :f(x_0+\\\\varepsilon) > f(x_0) + (K/2)\\\\varepsilon > f(x_0), so on the interval to the right, f is greater than f(x_0), and if \\\\varepsilon < 0, then: :f(x_0+\\\\varepsilon) < f(x_0) + (K/2)\\\\varepsilon < f(x_0), so on the interval to the left, f is less than f(x_0). Thus x_0 is not a local or global maximum or minimum of f.  Proof 2: Extremum implies derivative vanishes  Alternatively, one can start by assuming that \\\\displaystyle x_0 is a local maximum, and then prove that the derivative is 0. Suppose that \\\\displaystyle x_0 is a local maximum (a similar proof applies if \\\\displaystyle x_0 is a local minimum). Then there exists \\\\delta > 0 such that (x_0 - \\\\delta,x_0 + \\\\delta) \\\\subset (a,b) and such that we have f(x_0) \\\\ge f(x) for all x with \\\\displaystyle x - x_0 < \\\\delta. Hence for any h \\\\in (0,\\\\delta) we have :\\\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\\\le 0. Since the limit of this ratio as \\\\displaystyle h gets close to 0 from above exists and is equal to \\\\displaystyle f'(x_0) we conclude that f'(x_0) \\\\le 0. On the other hand, for h \\\\in (-\\\\delta,0) we notice that :\\\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\\\ge 0 but again the limit as \\\\displaystyle h gets close to 0 from below exists and is equal to \\\\displaystyle f'(x_0) so we also have f'(x_0) \\\\ge 0. Hence we conclude that \\\\displaystyle f'(x_0) = 0.  Cautions  A subtle misconception that is often held in the context of Fermat's theorem is to assume that it makes a stronger statement about local behavior than it does. Notably, Fermat's theorem does not say that functions (monotonically) \\"increase up to\\" or \\"decrease down from\\" a local maximum. This is very similar to the misconception that a limit means \\"monotonically getting closer to a point\\". For \\"well-behaved functions\\" (which here means continuously differentiable), some intuitions hold, but in general functions may be ill-behaved, as illustrated below. The moral is that derivatives determine infinitesimal behavior, and that continuous derivatives determine local behavior.  Continuously differentiable functions  If f is continuously differentiable \\\\left(C^1\\\\right) on an open neighborhood of the point x_0, then f'(x_0) > 0 does mean that f is increasing on a neighborhood of x_0, as follows. If f'(x_0) = K > 0 and f \\\\in C^1, then by continuity of the derivative, there is some \\\\varepsilon_0 > 0 such that f'(x) > K/2 for all x \\\\in (x_0 - \\\\varepsilon_0, x_0 + \\\\varepsilon_0). Then f is increasing on this interval, by the mean value theorem: the slope of any secant line is at least K/2, as it equals the slope of some tangent line. However, in the general statement of Fermat's theorem, where one is only given that the derivative at x_0 is positive, one can only conclude that secant lines through x_0 will have positive slope, for secant lines between x_0 and near enough points. Conversely, if the derivative of f at a point is zero (x_0 is a stationary point), one cannot in general conclude anything about the local behavior of f ‚Äì it may increase to one side and decrease to the other (as in x^3), increase to both sides (as in x^4), decrease to both sides (as in -x^4), or behave in more complicated ways, such as oscillating (as in x^2 \\\\sin(1/x), as discussed below). One can analyze the infinitesimal behavior via the second derivative test and higher-order derivative test, if the function is differentiable enough, and if the first non-vanishing derivative at x_0 is a continuous function, one can then conclude local behavior (i.e., if f^{(k)}(x_0) eq 0 is the first non-vanishing derivative, and f^{(k)} is continuous, so f \\\\in C^k), then one can treat f as locally close to a polynomial of degree k, since it behaves approximately as f^{(k)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^k, but if the k-th derivative is not continuous, one cannot draw such conclusions, and it may behave rather differently.  Pathological functions  The function \\\\sin(1/x) ‚Äì it oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0. Consequently, the function f(x) = (1 + \\\\sin(1/x))x^2 oscillates increasingly rapidly between 0 and 2x^2 as x approaches 0. If one extends this function by defining f(0) = 0 then the extended function is continuous and everywhere differentiable (it is differentiable at 0 with derivative 0), but has rather unexpected behavior near 0: in any neighborhood of 0 it attains 0 infinitely many times, but also equals 2x^2 (a positive number) infinitely often. Continuing in this vein, one may define g(x) = (2 + \\\\sin(1/x))x^2, which oscillates between x^2 and 3x^2. The function has its local and global minimum at x=0, but on no neighborhood of 0 is it decreasing down to or increasing up from 0 ‚Äì it oscillates wildly near 0. This pathology can be understood because, while the function is everywhere differentiable, it is not continuously differentiable: the limit of g'(x) as x \\\\to 0 does not exist, so the derivative is not continuous at 0. This reflects the oscillation between increasing and decreasing values as it approaches 0.

It was built by the emperor Trajan as an extension of the Via Appia from Beneventum, reaching Brundisium (Brindisi) by a shorter route (i.e. via Canusium, Butuntum and Barium rather than via Tarentum). This was commemorated by an arch at Beneventum. Background Via Traiana was constructed in 109 AD by Emperor Trajan at his own expense.

It was a two-week event held annually at Navy Pier that featured sixteen separate stages, each sponsored by a national retail brand and a media sponsor compatible to the stage's format, e.g. Rock WLUP, Chicago Tribune Jazz, Miller Brewing Company Blues and WXRT, that broadcast live from the festival. The stages were: Rock, Classic Rock, Country, Blues, Comedy, Roller Disco, Pin Ball Arcade, Jazz, Children's, Variety, Ethnic, as well as a Main stage seating 30,000. There were approximately 600 concert performances by headline artists produced each year. History Some of the hundreds of superstars that appeared over the years were Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, Carole King, George Burns, Orleans, Chicago, REO Speedwagon, Willie Nelson with Waylon Jennings, The Blues Brothers, Bobby Vinton, Journey, The Commodores, Kool and The Gang, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Charlie Daniels Band, Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Aretha Franklin, Ben Vereen, Dick Clark and Muddy Waters and a live TV broadcast of Bozo's Circus and productions for HBO and PBS. In addition to its 30,000 seat Main Stage, ChicagoFest featured 16 other stage areas that seated 2,500 to 5,000, that presenting nationally known recording artists. Iron Maiden, Spyro Gyra, Chick Corea and Gary Burton - Jazz, Joan Jett, .38 Special and Point Blank, The Joe Perry Project, The Scorpions, Krokus, Wet Willie, and many more on the Rocks, Asleep at the Wheel, Carl Perkins, and Bullseye on the Country Stage. The Buckinghams and Jan & Dean were among oldies stage headliners. In 1979, when Germany's Scorpions played one of their first American live Concerts on the floating stage at Chicagofest, the Chicago Police Department furnished over one hundred patrol men for show security. Admission to the fest was $5 General admission per day. The Web site https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070804/http://www.outernetweb.com/chicagofest/ includes an image of a rock stage schedule, along with other ChicagoFest memories. In addition to music, ChicagoFest also featured a cinema at which the premier of The Buddy Holly story attracted Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, The Premier of MTV was mounted at ChicagoFest, A Laser Light Show, The Mike Douglas Show originated at ChicagoFest, 100 local food vendors sales grossing ten million dollars annually. As the festival grew over the years, it attracted roughly 100,000 visitors per day, and approximately 1,000,000 people attended Navy Pier for the fest. The idea for ChicagoFest was taken from Milwaukee's Summerfest. by the special events office of Mayor Bilandic who hired the staff from Milwaukee. That staff - formed as Festivals Inc. included food managers Tom and Bill Drilias, entertainment producers Jerry Weintraub Jr and Lou Volpano, and public relations maestro Joseph Pecor. The success of the festival led to the creation of the Taste of Chicago, Loop Alive's restoration of the Chicago Theatre, and other event at Navy Pier such as Art Expo Chicago. Politics Jane Byrne became mayor in 1979 and attempted to cancel ChicagoFest. However, a public relations campaign mounted by the Chicago Tribune and Labor Unions gained enough support to convince Byrne to reverse her decision. In 1982, after black Chicago residents were angered by Mayor Byrne's nomination of three white board members to new positions in the Chicago Housing Authority, Jesse Jackson and other civil rights leaders called for a boycott of ChicagoFest. Stevie Wonder and over one hundred other local black entertainers cancelled their scheduled appearances, and a picket line was set up outside the festival. The city reported the boycott was ineffective, but it came out later they had lost millions of dollars. ChicagoFest was cancelled by Byrne's successor, Mayor Harold Washington.

Design and development Known by Helio as the model H-500 this STOL aircraft mounted twin Lycoming engines on top of the high-set wing, close to the fuselage. With the engines mounted in this manner, lateral and over-the-nose visibility were much improved while the propellers were kept clear of cabin doors and away from possible debris damage during rough field operations. This was a tail-wheel design, so the vertical component of propeller thrust assisted STOL take-off performance from rough fields. In 1967 or 68, work was started on a redesign of the Twin Courier in a tricycle-gear configuration for the commercial market, since many firms which desired STOL capability had regulations which required multi-engine aircraft. The company ran out of money and the project was terminated.

The game was initially developed as a sequel to Sea Dogs (–ö–æ—Ä—Å–∞—Ä—ã), but was eventually changed to correspond the Pirates of the Caribbean movie. It was still marketed as –ö–æ—Ä—Å–∞—Ä—ã 2 in Russia. The Xbox version was the first U.S. console game developed in Russia. A PlayStation 2 version was also originally in development, but was later canceled. An unrelated game by the same name was also released for mobile phones, as was a Game Boy Advance game. PC/Xbox version Pirates of the Caribbean is an action role-playing game in which the player, as Captain Nathaniel Hawk, goes on a series of quests for any one of the countries that control the islands of the Caribbean in the 17th Century. The player can buy new ships, recruit a crew and hire officers who will follow Hawk on his quest and help him in battle. The game features gameplay that takes place both on land and at sea, and allows the player to upgrade their character by earning skill points and gain new abilities. The game was originally developed under the name Sea Dogs II, and is an indirect sequel to Sea Dogs, which was released in 2000. In Akella's native Russia, the game is still referred to as Corsairs II, with Corsairs (–ö–æ—Ä—Å–∞—Ä—ã) being the Russian title for Sea Dogs. Apart from the pirate theme, the setting and the presence of the Black Pearl, the game otherwise has few connections to the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl film, which was released around the same time as the game. The PC version of this game is one of the first video games with multi-threaded code that is optimized for the Intel's Hyper-Threading technology. Actress Keira Knightley, who played Elizabeth Swann in the film series, voiced the narrator (only two simple cutscenes at the beginning and at the end) in the game. Plot After a fierce storm, Captain Nathaniel Hawk arrives on the island of Oxbay. His first mate Malcolm Hatcher is retiring, and so Hawk must hire a new first mate and crew. As he leaves Oxbay, a French armada attacks the colony and captures it. Hawk manages to slip away and warn the English governor on Redmond Island, Robert Christopher Silehard, that Oxbay was attacked. The governor sends Hawk on a series of quests to aid him in the war against France: Nathaniel is sent to investigate the condition in Oxbay; prevent a supply ship from reaching Oxbay; unload English troops in the jungles of Oxbay and rescue the English spy from the clutches of the French. While preparing for his next quest - annexing Oxbay, Nathaniel meets his old friends: Danielle Greene and Ralph Fawn. However, Ralph is killed when the soldiers arrive to arrest Danielle and Nathaniel himself is captured and imprisoned. While in prison he gets to know an old ex-cannoneer Edgar Attwood who was fired for drinking too much rum. He can be later hired by the player into his crew. Some time later governor Silehard arrives and tells Nathaniel that a big mistake has occurred. He sends Nathaniel Hawk on another series of quests until Nathaniel meets an old inventor who aids him in finding a treasure that could defeat the ghost ship called the Black Pearl. There are also a large number of side quests. For instance, in one such side mission Hawk is enlisted to help a Dutch colonist find several kidnapped children. The Black Pearl The Black Pearl is in this game but it is unknown if Barbossa is the captain (although Barbossa is set as the ship's default captain in the game codes). It cannot be destroyed. At night you see the Black Pearl's crew as skeletons. It can only be seen during the middle of the game and the end of the game‚Äîhowever, some people have reported seeing it at random points in the game. The ship can be found randomly around the world, normally mostly near towns. There will also be warnings in town if the Black Pearl is sighted nearby. In the final end game mission, Captain Hawk is confronted by the Black Pearl. Only during this fight can the Black Pearl be damaged. When the fight ends, the game is complete.

It was built in the Greek Revival style in 1837‚Äì1840, and served as the state house from 1840 to 1876.Illinois Historic Preservation Agency Old State Capitol website It is the site of candidacy announcements by Abraham Lincoln in 1858 and Barack Obama in 2007. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, primarily for its association with Lincoln and his political rival Stephen Douglas. State House First floor interior and staircase of Old State Capitol. Illinois House of Representatives chamber on second floor. From 1820 through 1837, the political capital of the young state of Illinois was the small village of Vandalia, Illinois, in the south center of the state. On the National Road, Vandalia was initially well-situated to fulfill its governmental role. As northern Illinois opened to settlement in the 1830s, however, public pressure grew for the capital to be relocated to a location closer to the geographic center of the state.Written history of the Old State Capitol in 1901 A caucus of nine Illinois lawmakers, including the young Whig Party lawyer Abraham Lincoln, led the effort to have the capital moved to the Sangamon County village of Springfield. Their efforts were successful in 1837, when the Illinois General Assembly passed a law creating a two-year transition period with the goal of moving the capital to Springfield in 1839. Workers built a state office building, large for the time, on the central square in Springfield in 1837‚Äì40. The cost was $240,000, of which the city of Springfield paid $50,000. The structure, designed by local architect John Francis Rague and constructed of locally quarried yellow Sugar Creek limestone, contained chambers for both houses of the General Assembly, offices for the Governor of Illinois and other executive officials, and a chamber for the Illinois Supreme Court. It was in this building that Lincoln served his final term as a state lawmaker in 1840‚Äì41. As a lawyer, he pleaded cases before the state supreme court in this building (1841‚Äì60). In the Illinois House chamber, Lincoln made his House Divided speech in June 1858, announcing his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. It was to the same chamber, in May 1865, that his body was returned to lay in state, arriving from Washington, D.C., prior to final burial in Springfield's Oak Ridge Cemetery.NPS Historic site nomination paper As a result of economic growth spurred by the American Civil War and consequent industrialization, this fifth or Old State Capitol was, by the 1870s, too small to serve the purpose for which it had been built. Illinois built its sixth and current State Capitol building four blocks to the southwest, and the state government turned the Old State Capitol over to Sangamon County to serve as the county courthouse. Courthouse From 1876 until 1966, the Old State Capitol was the county courthouse of Sangamon County. During this time the building was extensively altered. In 1839, a two- floor building had been large enough to hold the entire governmental structure of Illinois; but after continued growth in the population of Springfield and the surrounding townships, in 1898-1899 Sangamon County raised the historic structure 11 feet (3 meters), added a third floor under it, and demolished and reconfigured the interior to hold circuit court rooms and office space. In the early 1960s, the Civil War centennial rekindled interest in the historic central Springfield structure. In addition, Sangamon County's space needs had grown so urgent as to require the county to build for itself an entirely new courthouse building. The county retroceded the Old State Capitol to the state of Illinois, this time as a place of public assembly and museum of Lincoln history. Illinois Historic Preservation Agency In order to restore and preserve the Old State Capitol, which had been extensively altered during its life as a courthouse, workers completely dismantled it, stone by stone, and rebuilt it. The public areas of the Old State Capitol were reconstructed to resemble the appearance of the building in 1860, when Lincoln last saw the capitol prior to his departure to Washington. The state also excavated the plaza under and around the Old State Capitol to construct an extensive office and parking complex, which later served as the headquarters of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. The reconstruction work was carried out in 1966‚Äì69, and the rebuilt House Chamber was available for the state's Constitutional Convention to use in 1970. Obama's campaign kickoff, February 2007. The restored Old State Capitol continues to be used for ceremonial functions. In February 2007 then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama officially announced his candidacy for President of the United States at this location, and in August 2008 he formally introduced his vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden, with the building as a backdrop. Visitors can tour the capitol on their own or take 30-minute guided tours. alt=Lincoln Bicentennial Professional life in Illinois cent, 2009 In popular culture A commemorative one-cent piece was minted for general circulation in 2009 to celebrate Lincoln's work as a lawyer.

Thomas Verner Moore purchased a tract of land on Sargent Road, and in 1923, Saint Anselm's Priory was born. The house was formed under the sponsorship of Fort Augustus Abbey in Scotland, which provided monastic training and sponsorship for the new priory. It was named after St. Anselm of Canterbury, the eleventh-century archbishop and theologian best known for his ontological argument for the existence of God. Initially, the monks were housed in an old farmhouse; the first church/monastery was built on a hill above South Dakota Avenue at 14th Street in 1930. A major addition was made to the monastery building in 1960, designed by noted architect Philip Johnson, to accommodate the growing number of monks. In 1942, the monks opened the Priory School, and they became wholly dedicated to teaching at their own school. As the number of monks increased, the monastery was made a conventual priory of the English Benedictine Congregation. In 1961 Pope John XXIII elevated the Priory to the rank of Abbey, and the name of the Priory School was changed to St. Anselm's Abbey School. Former prior Fr. Alban Boultwood, OSB, was named the first abbot and served in that capacity from 1961 to 1975; Abbot Alban died in his sleep on Wednesday, March 25, 2009.

The location of Ashdown is not known, but may be Kingstanding Hill in Berkshire. Other writers place the battle near Starveall, a short distance north of the village of Aldworth and south east of Lowbury Hill. The West Saxons were led by King √Üthelred and his younger brother, the future King Alfred the Great, while the Viking commanders were Bagsecg and Halfdan. The battle is described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Asser's Life of King Alfred. By 870, the Vikings had conquered two of the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Northumbria and East Anglia. At the end of 870 they launched an attempt to conquer Wessex and marched from East Anglia to Reading, arriving on about 28 December. Three days after their arrival they sent out a large foraging party, which was defeated by an army of local levies under the command of √Üthelwulf, Ealdorman of Berkshire, at the Battle of Englefield, but only four days later the main West Saxon army under √Üthelred and Alfred was defeated at the Battle of Reading.Abels, pp. 124‚Äì27 Four days later, on about 8 January, the armies fought again at Ashdown. The Vikings arrived first at the battle ground and deployed along the top of the ridge, giving them the advantage. They divided their forces into two contingents, one under their kings, Bagsecg and Halfdan, the other under their earls. When the West Saxons heard this from their scouts, they decided to copy the formation, with √Üthelred facing the kings and Alfred the earls. The king then retired to his tent to hear Mass, while Alfred led his forces to the battlefield. Both sides formed their forces into shield walls. √Üthelred would not cut short his devotions and Alfred risked being outflanked and overwhelmed by the whole Danish army. He decided to attack and led his men in a charge up hill. Battle then raged around a small thorn tree and finally the West Saxons were victorious. Although both the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Asser emphasise Alfred's role in the victory, in the view of Richard Abels it was the attack by √Üthelred when he joined the battle which was decisive and he may have intended all along to take the Vikings unawares. They suffered heavy losses, including King Bagsecg and five earls, Sidroc the Old, Sidroc the Younger, Osbern, Fr√¶na, and Harold. The West Saxons followed the Viking flight until nightfall, cutting them down. However, victory proved short lived, as it was followed by two defeats at Basing and Meretun. Soon after Easter, which fell on 15 April in that year, √Üthelred died and was succeeded by Alfred.Abels, pp. 129-34 The Battle of Ashdown can be dated because Bishop Heahmund of Sherborne died in the Battle of Meretun, and it is known that he died on 22 March 871. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the Battle of Basing was two months earlier, dating it to 22 January, Ashdown fourteen days before that on 8 January, Reading four days earlier on 4 January, Englefield another four days earlier on 31 December 870 and the arrival of the Vikings in Reading three days earlier on 28 December. However, as the two month interval between Meretun and Basing is probably not exact, the earlier dates are approximate.

The charges were imposed retroactively after Military Intelligence was declared an illegal organisation, which in turn meant The Myanmar Times had been effectively publishing uncensored material since its launch. He was released from Taunggyi Prison in Shan State on 23 April 2013 after serving more than eight years of a 14-year sentence. Swe's arrest and sentencing were generally considered political and linked to his father's senior position in Military Intelligence, a government body that was purged in 2004 after a power struggle within the military. Following Sonny Swe's arrest, his stake in The Myanmar Times was transferred to his wife, Yamin Htin Aung, who continued to hold the local share with another investor, Pyone Maung Maung, for almost a year.Uncertainty Surrounds Myanmar Times The Irrawaddy, 14 September 2005. However, she was forced by the Ministry of Information to sell her stake to another local media entrepreneur, Dr Tin Tun Oo, whose company, Thuta Swe Sone, publishes four other journals.

When Myanmar Consolidated Media's shareholders initially refused to comply with the ministry, rumours circulated that the paper would be shut down. Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer reportedly flew to Yangon to intervene, although his office denied this. At the time, the newspaper was still widely regarded as semi-official or government- influenced,Myanmar Times Carries \\"Killer Than Shwe\\" Ad The Irrawaddy, 24 July 2007. despite the fact it is run by a private company. When, on 17 January 2011, the state-owned paper The Mirror implied that Tin Tun Oo had taken over as editor-in-chief of MCM, fueling rumors of a power struggle between Ross Dunkley and Tin Tun Oo, it received a formal complaint from the media group. Following Sonny Swe's imprisonment in 2005, another Burmese media entrepreneur, Dr Tin Tun Oo, acquired the locally owned share of MCM in controversial circumstances. Post-censorship and daily launch The reformist Thein Sein government abolished pre-publication censorship in August 2012. Until then, all media in Myanmar including The Myanmar Times was heavily censored by the Ministry of Information's Press Scrutiny and Registration Division, commonly known as the Press Scrutiny Board. According to Dunkley, on average, 20 percent of the articles submitted to the censorship board were rejected, and the gaps filled were with soft news stories.Burmese government suspends newspaper The Committee to Protect Journalists, 23 January 2008. After a prolonged power struggle between Australian editor-in-chief Ross Dunkley and Dr Tin Tun Oo, prominent businessman U Thein Tun bought the shares of Dr Tin Tun Oo for an undisclosed sum in February 2013.

Dunkley sold his interest in the paper and transferred his responsibilities as CEO to Tony Child on October 1 of that year. In April 2016, Child was succeeded by Malaysian journalist Bill Tegjeu as CEO and Editorial Director. Since 2007, MCM has also published NOW!, a Burmese-language health, beauty, and fashion weekly magazine. Sister publications In late 2007 investors in Myanmar Consolidated Media took a controlling interest in well-regarded English- language newspaper The Phnom Penh Post, based in Cambodia.

The capital is Navrongo.  Background  The Kassena Nankana Municipal was upgraded by LI 2106 from the Kassena Nankana District which was established in 1988 by LI 1855. It is one of the thirteen (13) districts/municipalities in the Upper East Region of the Republic of Ghana. The municipality has Navrongo as its political and administrative capital. The municipality lies approximately between latitude 11¬∞10' and 10¬∞3' North and longitude 10¬∞1' West. The municipality shares boundaries to the north with Kassena-Nankana-West District and Burkina Faso. To the east, it shares boundary with Kassena-Nankana West District and Bolgatanga Municipal, to the west with Builsa District and to the south with the West Mamprusi District in the Northern Region.  Physical features = Climatic conditions  The climatic conditions of the Kassena Nankana Municipality is characterized by the dry and wet seasons, which are influenced mainly by two (2) air masses ‚Äì the North-East Trade winds and the South-Westerly‚Äôs (Tropical Maritime). The harmattan air mass (North-East Trade Winds) is usually dry and dusty as it originates from the Sahara Desert. During such periods, rainfall is virtually absent due to low relative humidity, which rarely exceeds 20 percent and low vapour pressure less than 10mb. Day temperatures are high recording 42¬∞ Celsius (especially between February and March) and night temperatures could be as low as 18¬∞ Celsius. The Municipality experiences the tropical maritime air mass between May and October. The average annual rainfall is 950mm.  Relief and drainage  The Municipality is generally low-lying. The landscape is generally undulating with isolated hills rising up to about 300 metres above sea level in the western parts of the municipality. Notably among these hills include Fie (280 metres), Busono (350 metres) and Zambao (360 metres) above sea level. The drainage system of the municipality is constituted mainly around the tributaries of the Sissili River ‚Äì Asibelika, Afumbeli, Bukpegi and Beeyi. A tributary of the Asibelika River (Tono River) has been dammed to provide irrigation facilities.  Vegetation  The Kassena-Nankana Municipality lies within the Guinea Savannah woodlands. The Municipality is covered mainly by the Sahel and Sudan-Savannah types of vegetation consisting mainly of the savannah grassland with short trees and thumps. Common trees found are Dawadawa, Baobab, Sheanut and Mango. 2 Figure 1.1: District map of Kassena Nankana East Municipality  Soil  Two main types of soil are present in the municipality namely the Savannah ochrosols and groundwater laterite. The northern and eastern parts of the municipality are covered by the Savannah ochrosols, while the rest has groundwater laterite The Savannah ochrosols are porous, well drained, loamy, and mildly acidic and interspersed with patches of black or dark-grey clayey soils. The groundwater laterites are developed mainly over shale and granite and cover approximately sixty percent of the municipality‚Äôs land area. This soil type is suitable for the cultivation of many crops, especially rice and vegetables and hence accounts for the arable land sites including most parts of the Tono Irrigation Project sites where both wet and dry season farming activities are concentrated (KNMA, 2010).  Political administration  The Kassena Nankana Municipal Assembly is the highest administrative and political authority in the municipality and is charged with the responsibility of formulating and implementing development plans, programmes and projects. The Municipal General Assembly comprises 49 members, 35 elected and 14 appointed in addition to the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) and a Member of Parliament (MP). The Municipal Chief Executive and the Member of Parliament, however, have no voting rights. The Executive Committee operates through sub-committees that are statutory or instituted by the assembly itself. There are 9 of such committees in the assembly including; the social services; justice and security; finance and administrative; women and children; works; economic and development planning; climate, environment and agriculture; medium and small scale enterprise and public compliant committees. There are six (6) areas/urban councils in the municipality. They include, Kologo, Pungu, Pindaa, Naaga, Gia area councils and the Navrongo Urban Council. There also exist decentralized departments that aid the Municipal Assembly to achieve the overall development in the Municipality. These decentralized departments include: the central administration, works department, physical planning department, department of trade and industry, agriculture department, social welfare and community development, finance department, department of education youth and sports, department of forestry game and wild life, disaster prevention and management, feeder roads department, department of registry of births and deaths and information services department.  Social and cultural structure = Traditional authority  There are chiefs and ‚ÄòTindanas/Tigatus‚Äô in every community. People with these two titles in the communities wield a considerable power and authority over their people. While the chiefs are the traditional political heads in the communities, the ‚ÄòTindanas/Tigatus‚Äô are the main custodians of the land relate the ancestral traditions and hold in trust for the people. In relation to ownership of land, individuals do not own lands but the family heads hold these in trust for the family. The chiefs oversee the distribution and sale of land. The 4 ‚ÄòTindanas/Tigatus‚Äô the original owners of the land, however transfer land to other family heads.  Marriage  The payment of bride price takes the form of cola nuts, tobacco and guinea fowls. In addition, bridegrooms pay seven sheep and a cow together with the aforementioned items. It becomes obligatory for the bridegroom to present a cow upon the death of the bride if initially he did not present one. If one was unable to pay the sheep and the cow, the children would be mandated to provide one before they can pay dowry for their own wives.  Inheritance  The patrilineal system of inheritance is practiced. The eldest son inherits the deceased father in trust of the family. There is no form of ownership of family assets by daughters ascribed by the traditional system. Funerals constitute another major customary practice of the people. Funerals are mostly organized after the harvest (and especially during the long dry season). Funerals are performed to mark the end of the transition from earth to life after death (The spirit world).  Social organization  Despite the diverse religious groups in the municipality, they co-exist peacefully. The various religious groups assist in the development of the communities in the Municipality. The Catholic Church, for instance, has been assisting in the educational and water infrastructure.  Economy = Agriculture  Agriculture is the dominant economic activity in the municipality. The major crops grown are millet, sorghum, rice, groundnuts, leafy vegetables, cowpea, bambara beans, okro, cotton, tomatoes and onions. Livestock reared in the municipality include cattle, sheep, goat, pigs, guinea fowls, fowls and other domestic animals like donkeys. Fish farming involving Tilapia and Mudfish are quite significant. Farm sizes are quite small and yields are very low as compared to other parts of the country due in part to poor soils and unreliable rainfall. There are few dams and dugouts which are being used for dry season farming. This has implications for food insecurity.  Commerce  Trading and commercial activities in the municipality revolves mainly around foodstuffs, semi-processed food and crafts. These commodities are sold in the local markets and outside the municipality. Commodities traded in ranges from foodstuffs and livestock to manufactured goods.  Manufacturing  The Kassena-Nankana Municipality has not much large scale manufacturing industries. It is mostly characterized by small scale food processing, craft and manufacturing industries, examples of which include smock weaving, pottery and blacksmithing.  Agricultural industry and processing  Processing of foodstuffs, cash crops and other goods are common features of the local economy. The major small scale industrial activities includes, sheabutter extraction, pito brewing, milling or grinding of millet for domestic use, dawadawa processing, weaving and dressmaking, pottery, rice milling and soap making. Most of these small scale industries are one-man businesses and hardly employ people. The sector is dominated by females and needs to be organized into groups and their capacities built to enhance their businesses. There are also varied business types in the municipality which needs to be developed in order to boost the local economy.  Banking and financial services  The Naara Rural Bank Limited, with its head office located at Paga has an agency at Navrongo. There are also non-banking institutions in the municipality which collaborate with the financial institutions to offer credit to groups and individuals. Such institutions include Non-governmental Organizations, Community Based Rural Development Project and National Board for Small Scale Industries. In addition, non-formal credit arrangements such as ‚ÄúSusu‚Äù are available for traders and small-scale producers.  Resources for development  The municipality is endowed with both human and natural resources. The siting of one of the campuses of the University for Development Studies in the municipality has also enhanced the easy access to tertiary education to the youth thereby enhancing human capital in the municipality. Sand and clay are the major natural minerals mined in the municipality for construction purposes. The special weather condition has also made it possible for the generation of electricity for national use through a solar plant in Pungu, a suburb of Navrongo. The Tono irrigation facility has also made it possible for all-year round cultivation of crops especially vegetables such as tomato, pepper, cabbage and onion.  Tourism and recreation  The municipality abounds in tourism potentials including various sites, cultural practices and other features of tourists‚Äô interests. The major ones among them are: the Unique Catholic Cathedral Edifices and the TONO Irrigation Dam, both in Navrongo. The festivals and funerals of the people are sources of tourist attraction. Supporting the tourism industry in the municipality is the hospitality industry, offering recreation and avenues for socialization. They include: Mayaga Hotel, Tono Guest and Club Houses, Catholic Social Centres and many new guest houses in the various communities.

He served as astronomer's assistant who was hired by Sir Thomas Brisbane to work at his private observatory, once located at Paramatta (now named Parramatta), New South Wales, about west of Sydney during the 1820s and 1830s. Dunlop was mostly a visual observer, doing stellar astrometry work for Brisbane, and after its completion, then independently discovered and catalogued many new telescopic southern double stars and deep-sky objects. He later became the Superintendent of Paramatta Observatory when it was finally sold to the New South Wales Government.  Early life  James Dunlop was born in Dalry, Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of John Dunlop, a weaver, and his wife Janet, n√©e Boyle. Dunlop was educated at a primary school in Dalry and went to work at a thread factory in Beith when he was 14. He also attended a night-school in Beith kept by a man named Gardiner. He became interested in astronomy at an early age and was constructing telescopes in 1810. By fortune in 1820, he made the acquaintance of the astronomically inclined Sir Thomas Brisbane. In the same year, Brisbane was appointed as the new Governor of New South Wales, who then decided to set up an astronomical observatory in the new Colony. Prior to leaving Britain, Dunlop was then appointed as his second scientific assistant, and both travelled to Sydney in 1821.  Career in Australia  Soon after arriving, Brisbane almost immediately started building his observatory at Paramatta (original spelling), now named Parramatta, and it was Dunlop who was employed to do the astrometric observations for a new accurate southern star catalogue. Also employed was the German born Carl Ludwig Christian R√ºmker (or sometimes as Charles Karl Ludwig R√ºmker) (28 May 1788 ‚Äì 21 December 1862), or simply Karl R√ºmker, who had been recruited by Brisbane as first astronomical assistant. R√ºmker soon left the observatory in protest of his treatment during 1823, leaving Dunlop in charge of the astrometric measures and general maintenance of the astronomical instruments and the Observatory. Dunlop was not a professionally trained astronomer, so he importantly lacked the necessary mathematical skills to do astrometric reductions. He had soon learned the necessary observational skills from the more able R√ºmker and his employer. Between June 1823 and February 1826 Dunlop then made 40,000 observations and catalogued some 7,385 stars, of which included 166 double stars and references to several bright deep-sky objects near the bright stars he catalogued. By the beginning of March 1826, he left the Paramatta Observatory and continued working at his own home in Hunter Street, Paramatta. For there he began organising his own observations of double stars and deep- sky objects for the next 18 months, in which he constructed telescopes and other equipment for his dedicated southern sky survey. Sir Thomas Brisbane, before finally departing Sydney for the last time in December 1825, arranged to sell all of his instruments to the Government so the observatory could continue to function. Some of the equipment he gave to Dunlop, which he used at his home, especially the useful small equatorial mounted refracting telescope that R√ºmker, and later Dunlop, both used for doing the important double stars measures as their own personal projects. By May 1826, R√ºmker returned to the observatory, and seven months later he was appointed as the first New South Wales Government Astronomer, though this officially did not happen until a few years later, much to R√ºmker's disgust, due to delays from his employers in Britain.  Back to Scotland  Dunlop left Sydney for Scotland in February 1827 and was employed for four years at the observatory of Sir Thomas Brisbane. He had done very good work as an observer in New South Wales, and was associated with R√ºmker in the recovery of Comet Encke at Parramatta in June 1822. He was later to be the first in Great Britain to rediscover this comet on 26 October 1829. He had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of London on 8 February 1828. Sir John Herschel, when making the presentation, spoke in the highest terms of the value of the work done by Dunlop in New South Wales. On arrival, he also reduced his southern double stars and deep-sky observations for publication, which was believed to have taken about one month, and these were published also in the first half of 1828. These two detailed astronomical papers were received with many accolades from his peers, which lasted until about 1834, when his observations were able to be scrutinised by John Herschel and Thomas Maclear in South Africa. Only then were the various flaws of his observations revealed, and the time spent in the zenith of popularly, then dwindled to fierce criticism and personal rejection especially from the British astronomical community.  Return to Australia  Jane Dunlop In April 1831, Dunlop was appointed superintendent of the Government observatory at Parramatta. He was selected mainly from his good knowledge of Colony and the observatory site, but the real reason for his selection was more because even though such an astronomical position was formally advertised, nobody applied for the astronomical tenure. Here he was to succeed R√ºmker with the reasonable good salary of ¬£300 a year. He arrived at Sydney on 6 November 1831 and found the observatory in a deplorable condition; rain had entered the building, roofing plaster had fallen down, and many important records were destroyed. Dunlop succeeded in getting the building repaired and started on his work with energy, but around 1835 his health began to fail; he had no assistant, and the building, having been attacked by white ants, fell gradually into decay. In August 1847, he resigned his position, and went to live on his farm on Brisbane Waters, an arm of Broken Bay. He died on 22 September 1848. In 1816 Dunlop married his cousin Jean Service, who survived him. In addition to the medal of the Royal Astronomical Society Dunlop was awarded medals for his work by the King of Denmark in 1833, and the Institut Royal de France in 1835. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1832, his proposer being Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane. Papers on, and references to, the work of Dunlop may be found in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, in the Edinburgh Journal of Science, and in the Transactions of the Royal Society between the years 1823 and 1839.  Observations and discoveries in Australia  Dunlop made several noteworthy discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere sky and in 1828 published A Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars in the Southern Hemisphere observed in New South Wales, which contains 629 objects. A little more than half the objects he discovered proved to be real, most being small nebulous objects being probably artificially created from the handmade reflecting telescope he had constructed himself. He found many new open star clusters, globular clusters, bright nebulae and planetary nebulae, most previously unknown to visual observers. His most famous discovery is likely the radio galaxy NGC 5128 or Centaurus A, a well-known starburst galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. Dunlop's other major observational work was of 256 southern double stars or \\"pairs\\" below the declination of about 30¬∞ South. These were listed in Approximate Places of Double Stars in the Southern Hemisphere, observed at Paramatta in New South Wales, published in 1829. Many of these pairs were actual new discoveries, though the most northerly of them had been earlier discoveries made by other observers. The Washington Double Star Catalog , WDS Catalog United States Naval Observatory. Accessed on line 9 June 2013.Notes file for the WDS , WDS Catalog United States Naval Observatory. Accessed on line 9 June 2013.References and discoverer codes, The Washington Double Star Catalog , United States Naval Observatory. Accessed on line 9 June 2013. These double star observations were all made roughly between December 1827 and December 1828, being observed through his homemade 9-foot 23 cm (9-inch) speculum Newtonian reflector, or by measuring the separated distances and position angles of selected double stars using the small equatorial mounted refracting telescope. Most of these pairs have proved to be uninteresting to astronomers, and many of the double stars selected were too wide for the indication of orbital motion as binary stars. It seems these observations were made when the atmospheric conditions were quite unsuitable for looking at deep sky objects, either being made under unsteady astronomical seeing or when the sky was illuminated by the bright moon. John Herschel immediately on arrival in South Africa in 1834 and 1835 re-observed all of the James Dunlop's double stars, but had troubles identifying them or finding significant differences in the measured positions of the stars. He first began with Alpha Crucis / Acrux, the brightest star in the constellation of Crux, also commonly known as the Southern Cross, then systematically searched for all the others. Herschel also was first to designate all the Dunlop double stars to begin with the Greek letter \\"Œî\\", which persists in many amateur observational references. Hence, bright southern doubles like p Eridani is known as Œî5, Gamma Crucis / Gacrux is Œî124, etc. Modern double star observers have since discarded this designation and prefer the observer abbreviation \\"DUN\\", as first adopted in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) as maintained by the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.. Hence, p Eridani is DUN 5, Gamma Crucis / Gacrux is DUN 124, etc. Death Dunlop died on 22 September 1848 at Boora Boora near Gosford in New South Wales.

First appearing in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940), Zucco is a mobster responsible for murdering the parents of Dick Grayson, which leads to Grayson becoming the original Robin and Nightwing. The character has appeared in Batman: The Animated Series, voiced by Thomas F. Wilson, and The Batman, voiced by Mark Hamill. Richard Zeppieri portrayed him in the first season of the DC Universe series Titans. Publication history Tony Zucco first appeared in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940) and was created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson. Fictional character history=Pre-Crisis Antonio Zucco (originally just \\"Boss Zucco\\" in his first appearance) is a Mafia boss, or simple low level thug (his position of power varies depending upon the Golden and Silver Age continuity) in Gotham City who is responsible for the death of Dick Grayson's parents. Throughout the years, Zucco's role in Robin's origin remains largely the same. Zucco tries to extort the Haly's Circus, where the Flying Graysons are the main attraction. When the ringmaster C.C. Haly (who runs an honest business) refuses to pay him protection money, Zucco sabotages the trapeze ropes the Graysons use in their act. The ropes break while Dick's parents are in mid-air. Because the Graysons perform their act without a safety net, they fall to their deaths. This caused C.C. Haly to pay him protection money to prevent any further \\"accidents\\". Dick is subsequently adopted by Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. Batman) and becomes his partner Robin. Both of them locate Tony Zucco and send him to jail and he is eventually sentenced to the electric chair.Detective Comics #38. DC Comics. Post-CrisisBatman: Year Three= Dick Grayson's narration establishes Zucco's backstory. A first-generation immigrant from Italy, Zucco is orphaned at a young age when a gang of criminals murder his parents for refusing to pay protection money. Zucco is sent to an orphanage, where he is cared for by Sister Mary Elizabeth. She tries to counsel Zucco, but he is a lost cause; consumed by anger, he prays only for the deaths of the men who killed his parents. As a young man, he runs away from the orphanage and joins one of Gotham's major crime families, and quickly moves up Gotham's criminal food chain.Batman (vol. 1) #436-439 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1989). DC Comics. After Batman apprehends him for murdering Dick Grayson's parents, Zucco is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Blackgate Penitentiary. After serving seven years of his sentence, he files for a parole hearing and offers testimony against other Gotham criminals. He professes remorse for his crimes, but hides an ulterior motive. Before he was sent to prison, Zucco had hidden a ledger in the orphanage where Dick briefly resided following his parents' deaths; the ledger contains incriminating information about the Mafia's operations in Gotham. Zucco plots to remove the ledger from the orphanage before it is demolished. Wanting to keep the truth from Dick (who has recently become Nightwing), Alfred Pennyworth goes to the parole hearing and pleads for the judge to keep Zucco in prison. Unfortunately, Dick learns of Zucco's release. Despite Alfred's attempts to stop him, Dick races to Blackgate to confront his parents' killer. However as he steps out of the prison, Zucco is gunned down by a helicopter hired by a rival crime boss. While Zucco's death gives Dick some closure, his already-strained relationship with Batman becomes further complicated. When Dick presses him, Batman insists he knows nothing about Zucco's murder. =Batman: Dark Victory= In Batman: Dark Victory, Zucco (dubbed Anthony \\"Fats\\" Zucco) is portrayed as a low-level thug working for Sal Maroni, a member of Carmine Falcone's Mafia empire. He and another minor family head, Edward Skeevers, are put in charge of drug smuggling. After constant attacks by other enemies such as Penguin, Zucco starts a new method of smuggling these drugs. He only lets Skeevers in on the secret, believing that its success will make their minor families greater than the Falcones and the Maronis put together, and attempts to take over Haley's Circus in order to use its trucks for his smuggling activities. He kills Dick Grayson's parents as a demonstration of power to the circus' owner, and then quickly goes underground. He is later found by Batman and Dick Grayson, who is not yet Robin, and is chased down a dark alley by Grayson until he has a heart attack, confessing to various crimes.Batman: Dark Victory #0-13 (November 1999 - December 2000). DC Comics. =Blackest Night= Tony Zucco's remains have been reanimated as a Black Lantern in DC Comics's 2009/2010 crossover Blackest Night, with John and Mary Grayson, Jack and Janet Drake, Captain Boomerang, and the deceased members of the original Dark Knight's rogue gallery. Dick Grayson and Tim Drake, who have become the new Batman and Red Robin, respectively face down Zucco and their parent's corpses. Dick eventually cryogenically suspends himself and Tim during the battle, which forces the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any signs of life from them.Blackest Night: Batman #3 (December 2009). DC Comics. =The Black Mirror= In The Black Mirror, it is revealed that Zucco had fathered a daughter named Sonia. She is seemingly a legitimate businesswoman and runs the GGM Bank under the alias of Sonia Branch.Detective Comics (vol. 1) #876 (April 2011). DC Comics. Dick Grayson, who had recently become the new Batman, initially hopes that Sonia is not as corrupt as her father. However, he is disappointed when he realizes that Sonia manipulated him into subduing rivals who wish to take over her bank. Due to the lack of evidence, Sonia remains beyond the reach of the law.Detective Comics (vol. 1) #878 (August 2011). DC Comics. The New 52 Tony Zucco in Nightwing vol. 3, #18 (May, 2013 DC Comics). Art by Juan Jose Ryp. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a young Dick Grayson sees Tony Zucco threatening C.C. Haly for protection money. When Haly refuses to pay, Zucco sabotages the trapeze, which causes John and Mary Grayson to fall to their deaths. Dick becomes obsessed with finding Zucco and roams the streets of Gotham City looking for him, eventually encountering Batman and learning that the Dark Knight and his new guardian Bruce Wayne are the same person.Nightwing (vol. 3) #0 (November 2012). DC Comics. Tony is still the father of Sonia Zucco in this continuity, and she and Dick have a tenuous relationship.Nightwing (vol. 3) #15 (February 2013). DC Comics. Zucco had disappeared soon after his arrest and is presumed dead. However, Sonia receives an e-mail saying that her father is still alive and living in Chicago, and relays this information to Dick.Nightwing (vol. 3) #18 (May 2013). DC Comics. Zucco is revealed to be working for Chicago Mayor Wallace Cole under the alias Billy Lester.Nightwing (vol. 3) #19 (June 2013). DC Comics. Cole knows of Zucco's criminal record, and years before covered it up by having him declared officially dead. When Nightwing arrives in Chicago, Cole tells a panicked Zucco to go into hiding.Nightwing (vol. 3) #20 (July 2013). DC Comics. Nightwing discovers \\"Billy Lester\\"'s true identity, and learns that his parents' murderer has a wife and son.Nightwing (vol. 3) #21 (August 2013). DC Comics. Nightwing shows up in Cole's office, demanding to know why he is protecting Zucco. He then secretly bugs Cole's office. Soon afterward, the Prankster addresses the whole city by video and reveals that Cole has been harboring Zucco for three years.Nightwing (vol. 3) #22 (September 2013). DC Comics. When Zucco learns what has happened, he returns to Chicago to help Nightwing.Nightwing (vol. 3) #23 (October 2013). DC Comics. Zucco tells Nightwing that he murdered Harold Loomis, the man who engineered the city's transportation system, on Cole's orders. He then explains that Prankster is Loomis' son, and he plans to blow up city hall as revenge; he also sent Sonia the email about Zucco to make sure Nightwing got involved. Nightwing and Zucco defuse the explosives and get Cole to safety, and Nightwing fights the Prankster. Zucco saves Nightwing's life by shooting and wounding the Prankster. He is then arrested for murdering Loomis. In jail, Zucco receives a visit from a man who suggests that his employers can help him beat the rap. Zucco insists that he wants to take responsibility to set a good example for his son. The man says there is no point in that, as Zucco's family has left him.Nightwing (vol. 3) #24 (December 2013). DC Comics. Other versions=All Star Batman and Robin In Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder, Dick Grayson's parents are killed by a low-level hitman named \\"Jocko-boy\\" Vanzetti.

Under this torture, Vanzetti reveals that the Joker ordered the hit.All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder #7 (November 2005). DC Comics. Afterwards, Batman throws Vanzetti into Gotham Bay with his hands tied behind his back, though Jocko-boy is later seen climbing out.All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder #8 (January 2008). DC Comics. Earth 3 In the Earth 3 universe, as seen during the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, Anthony Zucco is a clown who owns a circus. He is killed by Jonathan Grayson, who uses the circus as a front for his criminal activities.Justice League (vol. 2) #25 (February 2014). DC Comics. In other media=Television * Tony Zucco appeared in the two- part Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Robin's Reckoning\\", voiced by Thomas F. Wilson. This version is a nephew of Connie Stromwell, the former wife of Rupert Thorne's rival Arnold Stromwell. Tony Zucco's aliases include Billy Marin, Simon Dirks, Sid the Squid, Killer Coburn, and Punky Lesh. As in the comics, he threatens Haly's Circus' owner Mr. Haly for protection money and kills Dick Grayson's parents by sabotaging the trapeze ropes after Haly violently refuses him. After Bruce Wayne adopts Dick, Batman goes after Zucco with a vengeance. Following a visit from Batman while denying any involvement in the incident at Haly's Circus, Stromwell becomes enraged at Zucco's actions and kicks him out of the Stromwell Crime Family while disinheriting him, though he does not give him up to the police. After a couple of brief run-ins with Batman, an increasingly paranoid Zucco escapes but returns to Gotham nine years later for the episode's main events. After learning that his parents' murderer has returned, Robin goes after Zucco against Batman's wishes. While hiding at an abandoned amusement park, Zucco is tracked down by Batman, whose leg is injured by a paranoid Zucco. Zucco eventually corners and very nearly kills Batman, but Robin arrives and subdues Zucco after the two fight. He almost throws Zucco off the pier, but relents and gives him up to the police, finally finding justice for his family. * Tony Zucco appears in The Batman episode \\"A Matter of Family\\", voiced by Mark Hamill. This version acts as Gotham's Mafia Don with his three brothers that are his underlings and are all involved in circus acts. His brothers are a strong man (referred to in the credits as Bruiser and voiced by Maurice LaMarche), a lion tamer, and a juggler. His own skill is knife throwing. As a child, he was part of a knife- throwing duo with his father, with Tony throwing the knives while his father was bound to the giant target but he missed one time, killing his father. When Zucco offers his \\"protection\\" to the Flying Graysons, John Grayson refuses. When John is attacked by Zucco's brothers, Dick Grayson calls the police minutes after Zucco first appears in the Flying Graysons' big top tent. The call is intercepted by Batman quickly taking Zucco and his brothers down, resulting in Zucco's \\"Lion Tamer\\" brother being taken away by Gotham police while Zucco and the other two brothers escape. Swearing revenge on Batman and the Graysons, Zucco tampers with the railings of the Graysons' trapeze act, resulting in the deaths of John and Mary Grayson. After John's and Mary's murder, Batman corners every one of Zucco's remaining brothers until learning their boss' whereabouts: Haley's Circus. When Zucco knocks Batman out at Haley's Circus, he straps the Dark Knight to a knife-throwing wheel. However, Robin arrives just in time and battles Zucco long enough for Batman to free himself. At one point, Robin has the chance to enact revenge when Zucco falls from the trapeze platform. Robin chooses to save his parents' murderer and Zucco is then arrested by the police. * Tony Zucco appears in the Titans episode \\"Jason Todd\\", portrayed by Richard Zeppieri. As with previous depictions, he is responsible for the murders of John and Mary Grayson. Following his arrest, Zucco agrees to testify against the Maroni family in exchange for a release from prison. Upon learning that Zucco will be released, Dick ambushes a police convoy transporting Zucco with the intent of killing him. When the Maronis also arrive to assassinate Zucco, Dick refuses to help him and allows Zucco to be killed by the mobsters. The Maronis subsequently target Zucco's family, with only his son Nick surviving. Blaming Dick for what happened to his family, Nick attempts to avenge their deaths by murdering the other members of Dick's circus troupe, but is ultimately defeated by Dick and Jason Todd. Film * In Batman Forever, Zucco is replaced by Two-Face as the murderer of Dick Grayson's parents, who also murders Dick's older brother. Miscellaneous Tony Zucco appears in issue 6 of the Young Justice comics. He was featured in a flashback when Robin recaps his history. Like the comics, Tony Zucco tried to offer protection money to Mr. Haly who denied him. On April 1, 2006 during a trapeze routine without a net, Tony Zucco's men sabotaged the trapeze rig which broke during the act killing Dick's parents, aunt, and cousin while his uncle survived but was paralyzed. When Dick Grayson became Robin for the first time, he helped Batman bring Tony Zucco to justice.

Discovered in 1968 and described in 1972, it is the most recently described species of New World warbler (family Parulidae). The species name, angelae, is a tribute to Angela Kepler, one of its discoverers. The species birds are insectivores, as they feed by gleaning small insects off the habitat leaves. Due to its small populations and restricted habitats, conservation efforts were begun in 1982 to protect this species, but as of 2005, the warbler was still in need of protection. The species is not in immediate danger as the majority of its habitat is protected forest, but introduced species (such as rats and small Asian mongooses), habitat reduction, and natural disasters represent potential threats to the population. Discovery and naming The elfin woods warbler is one of many species in the genus Setophaga of the New World warbler family Parulidae. It was first observed in 1968 by Cameron and Angela Kepler while they were conducting observations on two Puerto Rican endemic birds, the Puerto Rican amazon and the Puerto Rican tody. On May 18, 1971, a specimen was captured in El Yunque National Forest, which at the time was believed to be its only habitat. A year later Kepler and Parkes described and named the species, making it the most recent warbler of the genus Setophaga discovered in the New World. Also, it is the first species described in the Caribbean since 1927 and the first Puerto Rican species described in the 20th century. The specific name, angelae, is a tribute to Angela Kepler. Elfin-woods warbler is an alternative spelling, and Reinita de Bosque Enano is the Spanish name. The species was initially placed in the genus Dendroica, but in 2011 the American Ornithologists' Union reorganized the classification of the family Parulidae and transferred species in Dendroica to Setophaga. This revised classification was adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union. A phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA sequences from New World warblers has shown that, within the genus Setophaga, the elfin woods warbler is most closely related to the arrowhead warbler, a species which is endemic to Jamaica, and the plumbeous warbler, which is endemic to the islands of Dominica and Saint Lucia. Description The warbler's upper body is predominantly black with white areas, while its underparts are white with black streaks. Other identifying characteristics are dark brown eyes, white patches on its ears and neck, an incomplete white eyering, a white eyestripe, and two white spots on its outer tail feathers. Characteristic of Antillean warblers (S. adelaidae, S. delicata, S. plumbea, and S. pharetra), the species features a long bill and short, round wings ( average). Among Setophaga spp., only S. adelaidae has a shorter wing length average () than the elfin woods warbler. Juveniles differ from adults, retaining a grayish-green back for approximately a year and partially molting from July to October. The warbler's average mature length is and its average weight is . Identification Black-and-white warbler, a species commonly mistaken for the elfin woods warbler The elfin woods warbler is often confused with the black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia), a non-breeding species in the Caribbean occurring in Puerto Rico from mid-September to early May. The main physical distinction is in the eyes. The elfin woods warbler has an incomplete white eyering, while the black-and-white warbler has a white band across the eye and a white lower half of the eyering. Another distinction is found in the crown, with the elfin woods warbler's being entirely black and the black-and-white's having a white band across. The latter species forages on larger branches compared with the elfin woods warbler's foraging in the canopy and on smaller branch tips. Voice The elfin woods warbler's song and call are difficult to hear.To listen to the sound of this species click here . The species has a subtle voice and its call and song resemble those of the bananaquit, the most abundant bird in Puerto Rico. The song is a series of \\"short, rapidly uttered, rather unmusical notes on one pitch, swelling in volume and terminating with a short series of distinct double syllables sounding slightly lower in pitch\\" while the call has been described as \\"a single, short, metallic chip\\". Behavior=Breeding The elfin woods warbler breeds from March to June. Both parents are involved in the construction of the nest and in feeding the chicks. Nests are built close to the tree trunk within dry aerial leaf litter, usually Cecropia leaves (a material used by no other Parulidae species), in Bulbophyllum wadsworthii trees. Nests are well-concealed and located above ground level. In 2003 a nest with four chicks was found inside a tree stump of Colorado tree, Cyrilla racemiflora, at Maricao. The nest was at about 15 feet above ground level, with little cover in a secondary forest area [13]. Nests are cup-shaped and made from small roots and twigs, dry leaves of Chusquea abietifolia and B. wadsworthii, and dry Panicum maximum leaves. The interior is made from fibers of C. abietifolia, dry leaves and other plant matter. Females lay two or three white eggs with red-brown spots. The chick's diet consists of insects‚Äîparents have been observed offering lepidopteran and orthopteran adults and lepidopteran larvae to hatchlings. Feeding The elfin woods warbler is commonly found foraging the middle canopy for insects. While searching for food it often flocks with other birds, such as black-and- white warblers, Puerto Rican tanagers and Lesser Antillean pewees. Three maneuvers used for catching prey‚Äîgleaning, sally-hovering and probing‚Äîhave been described. Gleaning is described as a hunting maneuver made by a standing or moving bird. Sally-hovering is a hunting maneuver made by a bird in flight. Probing is a maneuver in which the bird, by digging with its beak, forages the substrate looking for food in a manner similar to chickens. Gleaning, especially off leaves, is the maneuver used with more frequency by the elfin woods warbler while probing is the least used. Distribution and habitat When first discovered, the elfin woods warbler was believed to exclusively occur in the high elevation, from , dwarf or elfin forests of the El Yunque National Forest in eastern Puerto Rico. The wind-clipped trees in these forests rarely exceed in height and are characterized by stiff, thick twigs, leathery leaves and impenetrable, dense undergrowth ideal for hiding from predators. Later studies showed that the species migrated to lower elevations, between , in Tabonuco and Palo Colorado forests. Three more populations were discovered in the Maricao State Forest (1972, largest known population), the Carite State Forest (1977) and the Toro Negro State Forest (late 1970s).Anad√≥n Irrizary, Ver√≥nica (2006). Distribution, habitat occupancy and population density of the Elfin-woods Warbler. MS Thesis. University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. The species is presumed extirpated from two locales, occurring only at El Yunque National Forest and the Maricao State Forest. The elfin forest at El Yunque National Forest is characterized by high rainfall and humidity, low temperatures and insolation, and constant winds. It is found at mountain summits and is primarily composed of dense shrub and small trees with moss and epiphyte growth in its plants and floor. The species richness is low when compared to other types of forests (tabonuco, palo Colorado and palma sierra forests) found in the Luquillo Mountains. The elfin forest at the Maricao State Forest, located in western Puerto Rico, receives an annual average rainfall of , a high amount considering that a rainforest, by definition, receives a minimum of annually. Since its soil has low water-holding capacity its vegetation is more xeric than expected. The species's highest density occurs in Podocarpus forests in the Maricao State Forest. Little information is available on the elfin forests at Toro Negro and Carite. Status and conservation=Population Bird count of the elfin woods warbler (2001) In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the central and eastern region of Puerto Rico, affecting three (the El Yunque National Forest, Toro Negro and Carite populations) of the four known populations of the elfin woods warbler. A survey conducted two years later in the Toro Negro Forest, located in the Cordillera Central, did not find any individuals. Recent surveys suggest that, for reasons yet unknown, the populations at Carite and Toro Negro were likely extirpated. Continued monitoring of the elfin woods warbler populations is achieved through bird counts performed every three to four years by the Puerto Rican Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS). A survey conducted in 2001 found three individuals at the Maricao State Forest. An IUCN assessment of the elfin woods warbler, prepared in 2000, estimated a stable population of 600 mature individuals. More recently the population has been estimated to comprise at least 1800 mature individuals, a figure which equates to at least 2700 individual birds. Threats Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk, a natural predator of the elfin woods warbler The survival of the elfin woods warbler faces two main threats, predation and the destruction or alteration of suitable habitat. Confirmed native predators are the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus venator) and the extirpated white-necked crow (Corvus leucognaphalus), while unconfirmed native predators include two endemic snakes and several carnivores (from fossil records). Introduced species, such as cats (Felis domesticus), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), black rats (Rattus rattus) and small Asian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus), are also potential nest predators. These species have proliferated due to the presence of human-developed facilities, mainly for communication purposes, in the Maricao State Forest and El Yunque National Forest. Two factors contribute to the destruction of the elfin woods warbler's habitat: humans and nature. Human-related habitat destruction includes the construction of communication towers, acquisition of timber, and expansion of roads and trails. Nature's contribution comes from natural disasters such as forest fires and hurricanes. Protection The elfin woods warbler was placed on the United States federal candidate list for the Endangered Species Act in 1999, and the announcement was published on the Federal Register of October 25, 1999, Volume 64, No. 205, pages 57535‚Äì57547. The USFWS started to consider the need to protect the elfin woods warbler in 1982.All Federal Register Documents for the Elfin Woods Warbler In 2005, a group of scientists, scholars, artists and environmentalists petitioned the Bush administration to admit 225 species, including the elfin woods warbler, to Endangered Species Act protections. The IUCN first evaluated the status of the elfin woods warbler in 1988. At the time, it was given a classification of lower risk/least concern. In 1994 its status was changed to lower risk/near threatened, and in 2000 its status was changed to vulnerable, where it remained until 2017. The justification for maintaining the species' status as vulnerable was that \\"There are no direct or immediate threats, but the combination of a very small range and population may have important implications for its chances of long-term survival, and this species consequently qualifies as vulnerable\\".

Reputation Maurice Healy in his memoir The Old Munster CircuitMIchael Joseph Ltd. London 1939 described him with respect and affection: \\"he was one of the most charming judges I ever met\\". Yet Healy did not rate Madden especially highly as a judge. Admittedly his reputation was bound to suffer in comparison to such outstanding contemporaries as Christopher Palles and Hugh Holmes, in an era when the quality of Irish judges had never been higher. Healy recalled that to appear before Madden was a pleasure, especially if one could think of an appropriate literary reference, but his actual judgments were \\"weak and diffuse\\". This verdict was probably too severe; in particular Madden's judgment in Boyers v Duke remains a valuable decision on the formation of business contracts. Notable judgments His judgment in Powell v McGlynn and Bradlaw,[1902] 2 I.R.154 concerning liability for a runaway pony, affords an excellent example of his judicial style. The question of whether one defendant employed the other depended partly on whether the expression \\"humph\\" had any legal meaning. Madden, drawing on his knowledge of English literature, cited Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott, among other authors, to prove that \\"humph\\" had a definite meaning, namely an expression of disagreement. His judgment in Boyers v Duke[1905] 2 I.R. 617 is a leading decision on the concept of offer and acceptance in contract law, and in particular the precise meaning of a quotation by a seller of goods. Madden held that a quotation cannot be an offer to enter a contract, but is merely an indication of the terms on which the seller will do business. Applying normal rules of commercial practice, he found that if every quotation was in itself an offer which could lead to a binding contract, the business would be so swamped with obligations which it could not meet that it might well go bankrupt. Therefore, it followed that the letter of acceptance by the prospective buyer was in fact the first offer. The judgment has been described as an example of how commercial practice may influence the development of the law.Byrne, Raymond Cases on Irish commercial law and legal technique Round Hall Press Dublin 1988 p.112 References * Oxford Dictionary of National Biography * External links  Category:1840 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Attorneys-General for Ireland Category:Irish Conservative Party MPs Category:Irish Queen's Counsel Category:Irish Unionist Party MPs Category:Judges of the High Court of Justice in Ireland Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Dublin Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:People from County Tipperary Category:Scholars of Trinity College Dublin Category:Serjeants-at-law (Ireland) Category:Solicitors-General for Ireland Category:UK MPs 1886‚Äì1892 ","title":"Dodgson Hamilton Madden"},{"id":"4143115","text":"Yerevan Physics Institute The A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory () is a research institute located in Yerevan, Armenia. It was founded in 1943 as a branch of the Yerevan State University by brothers Abram Alikhanov and Artem Alikhanian. It was often referred to by the acronym YerPhI (Yerevan Physics Institute). In 2011 it was renamed to its current name A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory. History and strategy The Yerevan Physics Institute was founded in 1943 as a branch of the Yerevan State University by brothers Abraham Alikhanov and Artem Alikhanian. Later two high-altitude cosmic ray stations were founded on Mount Aragats (3,200 m) and Nor Amberd (2,000 m). The view of the Yerevan Physics Institute In 1963 the institute was transferred to the Soviet Union Atomic Energy State Committee. The construction of a 6 GeV electron synchrotron accomplished in 1967 became an important landmark in the history of institute, it is the first particle accelerator in Armenia (Arus \\"‘±’ê’à’í’ç\\"). After collapse of Soviet Union YerPhI continued research in the fields of high-energy physics and astrophysics in Armenia and worldwide using world biggest accelerators and cosmic ray detectors. Now YerPhI get status of A. Alikhanyan National Laboratory. Brief summary of scientific activities Among the key results of YerPhI in the early years were the discovery of protons and neutrons in cosmic rays, and the establishment of the first evidence of existence of the particles with masses between that of muons and protons. The high altitude research stations have remained the main research base of the Cosmic Ray Division (CRD) of YerPhI until now. Among the CRD achievements there were: discovery of sharp knee in light components of primary cosmic rays, detection of the highest energy protons accelerated on the Sun, and the creation of the Aragats Space environ¬¨mental Center in 2000 for studies of the solar-terrestrial connection, where CRD becomes one of the world's leaders. The 6 GeV electron synchrotron was accomplished in 1967. During 1970-1991 synchrotron was operated with energies up to 4,5 GeV and in Experimental Physics Division were obtained significant results, including: hadronic properties of photons in œÄ- meson photo-production on nuclei; structures of nucleon resonances in multi- polarization experiments, structure and characteristics of nuclear matter, important properties of X-ray transition radiation and channeling in monocrystals. Thanks to these achievements physicists from Yerevan Physics Institute started from 1985 are successfully participating in the large international collaborations. Traditional topic of YerPhI is the development of new particle detectors. Wide spark chambers and transition radiation detectors are examples of the experimental techniques developed and implemented in YerPhI. During the last years groups of scientists from Yerevan Physics Institute have actively participated in intermediate and high energy physics experiments abroad (JLAB, DESY, CERN-LHC, MAX-lab, MAMI), exploring the meson and nucleon structures, electromagnetic interactions of the nucleon, quark-hadron duality, short range nucleon-nucleon correlations, quark hadronization in nuclear medium, physics beyond standard model, Higgs boson searches, quark-gluon plasma, fission and fragmentation of nuclei and hypernuclei and many other topics, as well as constructing experimental hardware and develop the software for data acquisition and analysis. The theoretical department assure major achievements in the following areas: B-meson physics, QCD and Related Phenomenology, Neutrino physics, Quantum Field Theory, String/M-theory, Integrable Models, Statistical physics, Condensed Matter and Quantum Information. These results are internationally recognized and highly cited. In the mid-1980s in YerPhI was developed the concept of stereoscopic approach in Very High Energy gamma-ray astronomy using multiple Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). This concept was materialized in the very successful IACT system (HEGRA). After first success, Armenian physicists successfully participate in operation of the IACT systems on the Canary islands (MAGIC) and in Namibia (H.E.S.S.). In the course of many years, the Applied Physics Department of YerPhI successfully investigates electron-energy structure of new wide-band laser materials using synchrotron radiation in various spectral regions. The investigations were carried in DESY and will be continued in MaxLab- II (Sweden). Below are the integral parameters characterizing the efficiency of research conducted by national lab: number of publications and citations. The sizable enlargement of both parameters during last years is apparent. National lab scientists publish appr. 30% of scientific publications of Armenia. Most of publications appear in high impact factor journals; high quality of research in national lab is proved by citations ‚Äì more than 60% of overall citations to papers published by scientists from Armenia belong to national lab. Structure The YerPhI has seven divisions and Computer Centre. Experimental physics workshops are also parts of the institute.

They are usually depicted as enemies of the Hulk. The group consists of four members: Vector, the group's leader, who can repel matter telekinetically; Vapor, who can transform into any form of gaseous matter; X-Ray, who can generate and project radiation and fly; and Ironclad, who has a metallic body and can control his density. Publication history The U-Foes first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #254 (December 1980) and were created by Bill Mantlo and Sal Buscema. Per The Incredible Hulk #254 credits, editor Al Milgrom designed the costumes of the U-Foes while editor-in-chief Jim Shooter helped with the names of the U-Foes. As noted on the first page of that issue, the group's name was inspired by the 1979 Graham Parker song \\"Waiting for the UFOs\\". Fictional team biography Simon Utrecht, a former politician and multi-millionaire, funds an operation to gain superpowers the same way the Fantastic Four had, by flying into space and being exposed to cosmic rays. He chooses three other members to join him: Ann Darnell, Jimmy Darnell, and Mike Steel. What the group did not know was that they would be exposed to much higher amount than the Fantastic Four and that it would most likely kill them. The Hulk, in his Bruce Banner form, brings the ship down by reprogramming their computer before the group was exposed to the terminal levels of cosmic rays. The group did manage to gain powers and the newly christened U-Foes attacked Banner for interfering, convinced they could have become even more powerful without his intervention. Banner transforms into the Hulk and a fight ensues, but the U-Foes lose due to their inexperience with their newly gained powers and inability to fight as a team. In the end, their own ongoing mutations incapacitate them, and the team is scattered as they lose control of their increasing abilities. Some time later, as their powers stabilize, the U-Foes reunite with the goal of revenge and making a name for themselves in the public eye by killing the Hulk. Though they find the Hulk a more formidable foe, with the intelligence of Bruce Banner then in control of the Hulk, X-ray discovers a way to keep Banner in his human form by generating 'anti-gamma rays'. The U-Foes imprison Banner at the former Gamma Base and hijack television broadcasts worldwide, intending to gain infamy by killing Banner in front of the world. However, Banner is freed by his allies Betty Ross, Rick Jones, and Bereet, and defeats the U-Foes as the Hulk. Ironically, the U-Foes' attempt to gain fame at the Hulk's expense instead reveals to the world that Banner is in control of the Hulk's power, and leads to a brief period of Banner/Hulk as a popular celebrity and true superhero (ending when the savage Hulk persona re-asserts itself). After several defeats at the hands of the Hulk and his allies, each of the U-Foes are banished to a different dimension.Incredible Hulk #304-305 (Feb.-March 1985) They manage to reunite and find their way back to Earth when the mutant Portal's powers began manifesting. The U-Foes attempt to murder Portal to keep him from opening another portal to banish them, but are defeated by the Avengers. They later attempt to kidnap Portal to exploit his mutant powers, and are defeated once again by Captain America, Darkhawk, and Daredevil. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the team generally work alone, but occasionally work as hired hands for other villains. Working for the Leader, they attack the Pantheon, injuring dozens of civilians.Incredible Hulk #397 Despite the handicap of an orphan girl who had gotten mixed up in the battle, the Hulk and the Pantheon soldiers manage to subdue some of the U-Foes. The villains are tricked into hurting each other. During the Acts of Vengeance, the U-Foes face the West Coast Avengers with the help of the Mole Man, but they are defeated. Around this time, they play an important part in The Vault prison breakout in \\"Venom Deathrap; The Vault\\". The various U-Foes work together and with other villains to fight against the prison's security, its forces, Freedom Force and the Avengers. The U-Foes and other prisoners are neutralized by technological mind-control. The team later encounters the Hulk in the Arctic ice fields outside the Leader's devastated sanctuary for cancer victims. The Hulk, believing he had just lost his friend, intimidates them into fleeing. Both of the fights with the Hulk are part of manipulations by the Pantheon's ancient leader Agamemnon. Neither side realizes the old man is secretly a power-crazed murderous psychotic who enjoys manipulation. Later, the U-Foes are again part of a breakout from the Vault. During this, they manage to destroy the entire facility. The U-Foes also are freed from the Raft, when Electro breaks them out in the New Avengers,New Avengers vol. 1 #01 but are distracted from escaping by a confrontation with Crossfire and his team of mind- controllers‚Äîincluding Mandrill, Mister Fear, Corruptor and the Controller‚Äîover technology that had been stolen from them, until Spider-Man, Captain America and Iron Man are able to capture them. During the Civil War storyline, the Superhuman Registration Act brings the U-Foes to the attention of the United States government. The U.S. sends the B-Squad version of the Thunderbolts (Blizzard, Joystick, Fixer and Quicksand), after the U-Foes. After a battle in Portland, the U-Foes are arrested.Thunderbolts #104 Instead of due process, they are given the choice of joining the team or facing jail time. The U-Foes are among the villains recruited to join Hood's crime syndicate.New Avengers #32 - 37 (2007) The U-Foes are seen to be among the new recruits for Camp H.A.M.M.E.R..Avengers: The Initiative #25 During the Dark Reign storyline, the U-Foes are revealed by new Initiative leader Norman Osborn as the new Initiative team for the state of North Carolina.Avengers: The Initiative #26 Osborn orders the U-Foes to attack the Heavy Hitters after they secede from the Initiative. They help the other Initiative teams to defeat and capture the Heavy Hitters' leader Prodigy.Avengers: The Initiative #28 The U-Foes play a role in the beginning of Siege, when Osborn sends them to fight Volstagg. The resulting clash leads to Volstagg being (falsely) blamed for destroying Soldier Field and killing thousands, and giving Osborn the excuse to start a war with Asgard.Siege #1 With the help of other villains, they bring down Thor after attacked by the Sentry. When Osborn is defeated, the whole team surrenders and is then incarcerated. During the \\"Opening Salvo\\" part of the Secret Empire storyline, the U-Foes are among the villains recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.Captain America: Steve Rogers #16 Members=Vector * Real Name: Simon Utrecht * Power: Telekinesis, limited to attract or repel matter from his own body. Enormously powerful, as by focusing his power into blasts he was even capable of flaying most of the Hulk's skin and muscle tissue from his body when the latter resisted,The Incredible Hulk vol. 1 #398 (Oct. 1992) and repelled the structure of reality itself within the 'Crossroads' nexus, with force he claimed was sufficient to hurl entire worlds.Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #305 Also capable of flight. * Background: Simon Utrecht was a successful businessman, industrialist, and politician who craved more power. He used his resources to copy everything about the Fantastic Four's flight into space, and hired a crew in the hopes of gaining superpowers. Vapor * Real Name: Ann Darnell * Powers: Has the power to alter her form into any known gas, usually the most lethally poisonous she can imagine while invading an opponent's body. Vapor can transform into her fully human state for only brief periods, and is vulnerable to having her gaseous form scattered by strong winds or explosive force. * Background: Ann Darnell is Jimmy Darnell's older sister. She was hired by Simon Utrecht to be the life-support technologist on his space ship. During the Acts of Vengeance storyline, Vapor tried to kill Scarlet Witch. X-Ray * Real Name: James \\"Jimmy\\" Darnell * Powers: Has been permanently transformed into a living energy field, intangible and immune to most physical harm although his powers cannot affect lead. Has the power to expel various forms of heavy radiation in the form of very potent blasts, shown capable of hurting even the Hulk,The Incredible Hulk vol. 1 #397 (Oct. 1992) and severely weakening Thor when combined with three other energy blasts and the ability to fly in supersonic speed, or turn invisible. He has also been able to emit negative-gamma rays that turn the Hulk back into Bruce Banner, but this is only effective so long as he is conscious. * Background: James Darnell is the younger brother of Ann Darnell. He was hired by Simon to be the spaceship's fuel-propulsion engineer. Ironclad * Real Name: Michael \\"Mike\\" Steel * Powers: Permanently transformed into organic metal similar to the X-Man Colossus. Superhuman strength, durability, and the ability to increase or decrease his own weight, hovering in the air, or crushing like a mountain. Ironclad's form was initially composed of jagged folds of metal; however, after briefly losing control of his weight-altering powers and sinking deep into the Earth's crust, he emerged with his body smoothed and polished by the friction of his passage. * Background: Michael Steel is a scientist, engineer, and skilled pilot. He was hired by Simon to pilot his spaceship. he helped his comrades defeat their enemies multiple times after he changed to a great team man. Other versions=JLA/Avengers In JLA/Avengers, X-ray is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold when the heroes assault it in #4. He is seen fighting Captain Atom. Ultraverse In Malibu's Ultraverse, there exists a different Ironclad that was part of the New Exiles and Ultraforce. In other media=Television * The U-Foes appear in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, with Vector voiced by Cam Clarke and Vapor voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey while X-Ray and Ironclad had no dialogue. In the episode \\"Hulk Vs. the World\\", Vapor, Vector, X-Ray cameo the Cube's inmates while Ironclad was possibly seen from the back (but it is unclear whether or not it was him) but all their blood samples were seen. The U-Foes later return in the episode \\"Gamma World\\" Pt. 1 to distract the Avengers from destroying the Gamma Dome Generator. The U-Foes' powers are increased by Gamma Boosters made by the Leader. In the end, they are defeated along with the Wrecking Crew and Zzzax when Black Panther destroys the generator. * The U-Foes appear in Avengers: Ultron Revolution, with Vector voiced by Glenn Steimbaum, Vapor voiced by Catherine Taber, X-Ray voiced by Jeremy Kent Jackson, and Ironclad voiced by Eric Ladin. Backed by HYDRA, four scientists ride a spaceship into a cosmic gamma storm. In their self-titled episode, their spaceship threatens to crash into Vista Verde but the Hulk ends up redirecting it. Upon emerging from the spaceship, the scientists discover their powers and take the U-Foes name because their spaceship resembled a UFO. Unwittingly mentioning HYDRA's involvement in front, the Hulk ends up attacking them only to be subdued. Heading to HYDRA's base, the HYDRA Agents are informed by U-Foes that they will lead HYDRA as the Avengers attack. The U-Foes fight while the HYDRA Agents download everything top secret before escaping. Later on, the U-Foes and HYDRA infiltrate an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. base and steal an old-fashioned Helicarrier. While preventing the crashlanding Helicarrier from heading into a nuclear power plant, the Avengers trick the U-Foes into going into a room where they were subdued by knockout gas. Video games * The U-Foes appear in The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga.The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga for DOS (1997) - MobyGames * The U-Foes appear in The Incredible Hulk, with Vector voiced by S. Scott Bullock, Vapor voiced by Rachael MacFarlane, X-Ray voiced by Keith Ferguson, and Ironclad voiced by Mitch Lewis. While Ironclad and Vapor appear virtually identical to their comic book incarnations, X-Ray is presented as glowing green with a silhouette of his skeletal structure visible through his flesh, and Vector retains a normal human appearance rather than being physically transformed. In this version, their original intention was to duplicate the accident that created the Hulk using atmospheric rather than gamma radiation. Their rage is subsequently directed at the Hulk due to him destroying the antenna that was gathering the radiation. The U-Foes attack the Hulk, but he defeats all of them. After the Hulk leaves the area, the U-Foes recover and decide if Hulk interferes with them again, they will kill him. After playing through the initial battle with the U-Foes in the game's story mode, the villains occasionally appear, individually or in pairs, in different parts of the city as random encounters in sandbox mode. Ironclad can also be unlocked as a playable character skin if the player can manipulate one of the other U-Foes (Vector, X-Ray, Vapor) into injuring another during an encounter. * The U-Foes are featured in the Playdom game Marvel Avengers Alliance as recurring bosses.

The process of making garlic powder comprises drying and dehydrating the vegetable, prior to powdering it through machinery or home-based appliances contingent on the scale of production. Garlic powder is a common component of spice mix. It is also a common component of seasoned salt.  Production = Cultivation  There are two types of garlic species: Softneck (Allium Sativum Sativum) and Hardneck (Allium Sativum Ophioscorodon). Hardneck garlic varieties are believed to have more flavour than Softneck garlics, characterized by a spicy and more complex taste than other garlic strands. While Hardneck Garlics flourish in cold weather, due to their extensive time of vernalization, Softneck's seemingly grow better in warmer climates. Distinguishing between a Hardneck and Softneck garlic is done through the presence of a scape (flower stalk). The garlic species most commonly used to powder is the Softneck variety. Due to their less-complex scent and taste, the Softneck species are more suited as a garnish or spice in dishes and also have a longer storage life than Hardneck varieties. Garlic cloves thrive when planted in mid-autumn, in a location with plentiful sunlight. In tropical areas, garlic most successfully grows when planted in Autumn, maturing in early summer and is planted in later Autumn in cooler areas, to be harvested in late Summer. The larger bulbs are split and inserted into soil, around 4-6 inches apart, and 3 inches deep, with the pointy end facing upwards. Softneck and Hardneck garlic are planted identically, however, Softneck garlics are more suited to warmer climates. Garlic must be harvested at a particular time in order to prevent the vegetable from rotting, while also maximising the growth of each bulb within the skin. Green garlic is indicative of harvesting that has taken place before the cloves have developed, ‚Äòsoft‚Äô garlic is the term given to a harvested garlic that is fully developed, while damaged garlic, with a caramelised appearance inside, has been harvested too late and a result of frost. When the leaves turn yellow in colour, harvesting may be initiated.  Manufacturing  Women sorting dried garlic pods to be ground into garlic powder Garlic cloves are peeled and sliced. In most cases, the garlic is then heated to a temperature of between 150¬∞ and 160 ¬∞C (~300-320 ¬∞F). The water is removed to a moisture content of about 6.5%. The dehydrated garlic is then further sliced, chopped, or minced until the powder is reduced to the desired particle size. Manufacturing garlic powder on a larger scale involves various steps, from extraction of the garlic bulbs to packaging the final powder. After harvesting the raw garlic, bulbs are cleaned under mild pressure to remove skin and separate the cloves. The garlic is then dehydrated using both historical and newly developed methods. While old methods, such as using natural elements of sun and wind to evaporate water from foodstuffs are still utilized in many parts of the world, new technology has enabled for more flexible and economically viable procedures such as vacuum and freeze drying. Once the garlic cloves are dried and dehydrated, they are powdered using large scale machines and powdering units. Milling machine diagram Milling is the process of using mechanical action to break down substances through rotary cutting. As powder processing generally includes additives and is done in a bulk scale, the milling process breaks down materials to the required size for suppliers. Milling may require a series of steps, from de-agglomeration to fine grinding. The four components include Delumpers, Conical mills, Hammermills and Fine grinders. The garlic powder industry utilises milling machinery in order to progress with large scale production. The integrated systems of the machine consist of Feeding and metering, Sifting, Conveying and Dust collection. Another major machine used in the process of creating garlic powder is a vacuum dehydrator, which takes all the moisture from the vegetable without spoiling colour, scent and taste. Freeze drying is also used in the garlic industry as an alternative to vacuum dryers. In India, on a scale of 300 tonnes of garlic powder production per year, the manpower required to operate the machinery and overlook the production units is 12 persons. The estimate for this scale of production is around two skilled workers, two semi skilled workers and eight helpers.  Regions  There are approximately 300 types of garlic produced worldwide. Garlic market regions include North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Within China, which produces the largest amounts of garlic, there are five main provinces in which garlic is grown, including Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Yunnan and Hebei. As soft neck varieties tend to flourish in warmer climates where winters are mild, the Chinese provinces are suitable for harvesting and manufacturing garlic powder.  Market  The market for garlic powder can be split into multiple segments based on source, packaging, end use and distribution channels. The key market players in the Garlic Powder industry are inclusive of some of the world's most renowned manufacturers and suppliers such as McCormick and company inc, Garlico industries limited, Masterfoods ltd and Amazon spices private limited. China is the largest producer of garlic powder, followed by India, with both countries consuming garlic powder as part of their native cuisines and having hundreds of their own internal suppliers within the countries.  Usage = History  While doubts still remain about garlic's exact origins, it is believed to have originated in Central Asia, South Asia, or southwestern Siberia. Garlic grows wildly in Italy and Southern France, but is predominately grown in China, which accounts for 20.0 million tonnes of Garlic per year (80% of total production). Garlic has been a substance used for thousands of years and has served many purposes, from medicinal uses to culinary and spiritual practices. The nutritional properties of garlic have created many benefits for human use and offer a wide range of purposes.  Culinary use  The use of garlic as a food has ancient origins in Asia. Garlic has been used for centuries as a wholefood, and as a flavouring agent. Garlic can be manipulated in multiple ways to create bi-products, such as powder, oil and salt, to enhance foods in both nutrients and flavour. Garlic powder is a common additive to traditional dishes of central Asia and European countries as it provides the flavour of garlic without the labour of preparing the fresh vegetable and sustains a longer storage life.  Storage  Dependent on the storage conditions, garlic powder generally lasts in good condition up to 4 years. Manufactured garlic powders have a ‚Äòbest before‚Äô date printed on them to provide an estimate for how long the powder will be in peak condition for in respect to flavour and texture. Garlic powder must be stored in a cool, dry place, to avoid clumping of the powder. If powder is exposed to moisture or heat, it could cause the product to harden or clump. Fresh garlic remains ripe for up to half a year as a whole bulb, and up to a month if it is an unpeeled clove, while dehydrated garlic can last for years. Composition and nutrition  Garlic powder is 73% carbohydrates (including 9% dietary fiber), 17% protein, 1% fat, and 6% water. In a 100 gram reference amount, garlic powder supplies 332 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (30% DV), thiamin (31% DV), vitamin B6 (147% DV), and several dietary minerals.

The following communities and towns border on the community of Nehren (clockwise, beginning in the north): Gomaringen, M√∂ssingen, Ofterdingen and Du√ülingen. History Nehren was mentioned documentary for the first time in 1086. The settlement in today's form developed in the 15th and 16th centuries, when the abutting villages Nehren and Hauchlingen were combined, after they had been \\"churchly combined\\" some years before. In the 18th century, some row graves were uncovered near \\"the Kappel\\". In the northeast of the railway T√ºbingen-Sigmaringen an area of the Hallstatt Time (about 8th-5th century BC), with approximately 30 grave hills, forms one of the biggest grave fields in the district of T√ºbingen. In former times Nehren possessed even a castle. During an excavation of the castle hill in the corridor \\"Weihergarten\\" in 1951 the foundation walls of a rectangular building, perhaps of a stone house or a tower, were laid open. During the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648), Nehren suffered from draughts of alternating ruler's troops because of its location near the \\"Swiss road\\" (today: national road 27). The village was plundered and many houses and barns were destroyed. More specific information about Nehren offer the \\"village chronicles\\". They were penned in 1838 by pastor Friedrich August K√∂hler (1768‚Äì1844), who worked and lived here for more than 10 years.

It is a collection of 74 tracks distributed in six CDs, around a quarter of which were unreleased prior to the album; all the tracks were subject to extensive re-mastering at EMI's Abbey Road Studios. The set starts with a selection of early tracks by the members of the band before they joined Deep Purple. The box set also houses a format book written by Deep Purple archivist Simon Robinson, which tells the band's story via 120 pages of text, pictures, cuttings, memorabilia, musician profiles and discographies. Listen, Learn, Read On has been deleted from EMI's catalogue and is no longer in production.

Their name is variously translated as ssts'p-abc (\\"meander dwellers\\", a group residing around Bothell), s-tah-PAHBSH (\\"willow people\\") or as Samena (\\"hunter people\\"), which was corrupted into Sammamish. According to Hitchman, it does not mean \\"hunter people\\", the name is derived from samma, meaning \\"the sound of the blue crane\\" and mish, meaning \\"river.\\" The name may have originated with the Snoqualmie‚Äîsome tribal members once lived along the lake near the bottom of Inglewood Hill‚Äîbut this has not been verified.The Sammamish Heritage Society - Sammamish Names Then and Now They were also known to early European- American settlers as \\"Squak\\", \\"Simump\\", and \\"Squowh.\\",Also Wilma (2003) Squak is a corruption of sqwa'ux, meaning Issaquah Creek, which was a village site on Sammamish Lake. They were closely related to the Duwamish, and have often been considered a Duwamish sub-group as part of the Xacuab≈° (\\"People of the Large Lake\\") who lived near Lake Washington. Like the Duwamish, the Sammamish originally spoke a southern dialect of Lushootseed. The largest Sammamish village was tlah-WAH-dees at the mouth of the Sammamish River, which at the time was between present-day Kenmore and Bothell, east of its present location at the southwest corner of Kenmore.Also Wilma (2003) and Dailey (2006) The mouth of the river moved to the west after 1916, when Lake Washington was lowered nine feet by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.Phelps (1978), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project 1913‚Äì1916, pp. 67-69 A second Sammamish village with at least one longhouse was located near what is now Issaquah. When Europeans from the Hudson's Bay Company arrived in the area in 1832, the Sammamish had several permanent and seasonal settlements along the length of the river, and numbered as many as 200. In 1855, the United States government signed the Treaty of Point Elliott with the putative leaders of most of the Puget Sound tribes, including Chief Seattle of the Duwamish. The territorial governor moved to enforce the treaty by relocating the tribes named in the treaty, including the Sammamish. Many of the Sammamish, including a leader known as Sah-wich-ol-gadhw, did not accept the validity of the treaty. Negotiations with Indian agent 'Doc' Maynard were unsuccessful, and in 1856 some of the Sammamish joined in the Battle of Seattle, a raid on the White settler population.Morgan ([1951], 1982), 35-52 After this attack and the brief Puget Sound War, the Sammamish relocated from the river valley to reservations named in the treaty, or to non-reservation lands. Local sawmill owner and real estate developer Henry Yesler, who had previously used local Indians as laborers, aided the removal and relocation. As with the relocation of other Northwest natives, the occupation of lands and the relocation of people was probably significantly enabled by a smallpox plague in 1862 that may have killed as much as half of the remaining native population, as well as by the devastation from the effects of various previous epidemics.Also Boyd (1999) After this relocation, descendants of the Sammamish dispersed into other tribes, including the Suquamish, Snoqualmie, and the people of the Tulalip Reservation, and are generally considered members of those tribes.Tollefson (1994), pp. 692-3  See also  * Coast Salish peoples * History of Seattle before 1900  Notes  Bibliography  * * Page links to Village Descriptions Duwamish-Seattle section \\"Village Descriptions Duwamish-Seattle\\".

It was created by President J√¢nio Quadros with an area of about . The purpose was to protect the natural resources and support ecotourism activities. The park lies in the Serra do Capara√≥ on the border between the states of Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo. It has an area of about , of which 80% is in Esp√≠rito Santo. It includes parts of the municipalities of Alto Capara√≥, Alto Jequitib√°, Capara√≥ and Espera Feliz in Minas Gerais, and of Dores do Rio Preto, Divino de S√£o Louren√ßo, Ibitirama, I√∫na and Irupi in Esp√≠rito Santo. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002. Altitude ranges from . The park contains the third highest peak in Brazil, the Pico da Bandeira. Ten other peaks are over in altitude. It protects the watersheds of the Itabapoana, Itapemirim and Doce rivers. Annual rainfall is about . Average temperatures range from , but in winter (June and July) it is common to have temperatures below freezing at the higher altitudes. Biota The Serra do Capara√≥ has a very representative area of Atlantic Forest, with unique examples of alpine meadows. The park has several species of endemic and endangered flora and fauna. On the east side in the state of Esp√≠rito Santo the vegetation is mainly tropical rainforest. On the dryer west side in Minas Gerais it has tropical rainforest up to , then high-altitude forest with brushwood up to , and above that open fields among the rocky outcrops. Plants at higher regions are adapted to stony soils, frost and ice crusts. Fauna has suffered from hunting, but the park is still home to endangered species such as southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and pampas deer (Ozotocerus bezoarticus). The park also includes species such as the jaguar, tapir, harpy eagle, black- fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) and solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius). Facilities There is an entrance to the park in the municipality of Alto Capara√≥, Minas Gerais, where the park headquarters are, and in the municipality of Dores do Rio Preto, Esp√≠rito Santo. The Minas Gerais entrance was inaugurated in September 1998. The visitor centre has space for exhibitions, and auditorium with capacity for 64 people, toilets, a souvenir shop and snack bar. Access to the park is controlled. Visitors may not bring domestic animals, hunting or fishing equipment, may not collect plants, fruit, animals or stones, and may not use two-wheeled vehicles. There is an extensive network of hiking trails and four camping area for visitors with bathrooms and other facilities.

The hockey coach at West Point for more than 35 years, Riley coached the United States to the gold medal at the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics, during which he cut future Olympic coach Herb Brooks at the last minute. He played for the U.S. Olympic team at the 1948 St. Moritz Olympics. Biography Riley was born in Boston in 1920Many sources give 1922 as a year of birth, but 1920 is backed by the Society for International Hockey Research and the U.S. Public Records Index and raised in Medford, Massachusetts. He played prep-school hockey at Tabor Academy and was graduated in 1939. He played college hockey at Dartmouth College (1940‚Äì1942 and 1946‚Äì47) as well as for the U.S. Naval Air Corps (1942‚Äì1946). In 1948 he was part of an American team that was disqualified as two rival teams arrived for the Americans at the St. Moritz Olympics. (See Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics.) He was then player-coach of the national team at the 1949 IIHF World Championship. Riley began his Army coaching career in 1950, remaining the Cadets' head coach through 1986. During his tenure, he twice won the Spencer Penrose Award for NCAA Coach of the Year. He was replaced by one of his sons, Rob Riley in 1986. Another son, Brian Riley, took over the job from Rob in 2004. Rob's son Brett was named as the inaugural head coach at Long Island University in 2020. Riley's Americans surprised the hockey world going undefeated in winning the country's first Olympic gold medal and second ever. Riley was inducted in the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979, and the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 1998.

He was most active in 1913 and seven of his games between 1903 and 1927 are recorded but, of these, only one is a victory.Viktor Dyk, Chessgames.com, retrieved 13 April 2014 Viktor Dyk studied at a gymnasium in Prague (one of his teachers was Alois Jir√°sek). Dyk completed his education at Charles University in Prague where he achieved a degree in law. However law and politics were to dominate his life.Viktor Dyk , Plamen Press, retrieved 13 April 2014 Photo taken in 1899, aged 22 Funeral procession, 1931 In 1911, he became involved in politics and joined the St√°topr√°vnƒõ pokrokov√° strana. He stood for office in the 1911 elections, but received just 205 votes in Vinohrady and placed fourth overall of five candidates. Dyk together with Franz Kafka spoke of a \\"Great Wall\\" which, like the Great Wall of China or the Tower of Babel, became a metaphor for the cultural and linguistic division that they believed was required between Czech and Germanic culture. Dyk wrote in the magazine Lum√≠r, where he was known to state that Bohemia had to become Czech or they should die in the attempt. On April 13, 1913, he composed a tirade in reply to an article published by Franz Werfel. Dyk stated that his group had not built the \\"Great Wall\\" as they were not opposed per se to German ideas, however they did see the dangers. Dyk saw no problem with communicating with Germans but he warned against \\"surrender\\" to ensure that they did not become \\"Czech speaking Germans\\". During the First World War, he continued to write and he became involved in helping write a libretto for an opera by Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek. Jan√°ƒçek's fifth opera, The Excursions of Mr. Brouƒçek to the Moon and to the 15th Century went through a number of librettists and Dyk worked on Jan√°ƒçek's opera which was based on a story by Svatopluk ƒåech. In 1915 he started working with Vinohrady Theatre. Later he was imprisoned in Vienna for his resistance activities against Austria- Hungary. He was in jail in 1916 and 1917 for suggesting that Moravia and Bohemia could secede from the empire. In May 1917 Dyk was one the signatories of the Manifesto of Czech writers. This was an important document created by Jaroslav Kvapil who was the director of Czech National Theatre. Kvapil managed to get 200 writers to sign the manifesto and it was designed to encourage the Czech deputies to the Imperial Council in Vienna to support Czech self- determination.Manifesto of Czech writers, Czech Wikisource, retrieved 14 April 2014 In 1918, he co-founded the Czechoslovak National Democratic Party ().

The magazine's followers were known by the same name as the magazine. The writers and artists involved started a new direction in Czech culture. Previously, the culture was seen as coming from Germans and sources in German. For instance, German poets like Heinrich Heine were translated poem by poem from German to Czech. With the emergence of the Lum√≠r group writers like Vrchlick√Ω, Dyk himself and Julius Zeyer the focus turned away from German culture. This change of focus is said to have led other Czech intellectuals to also look in this new direction for scientific, economic and social ideas. His political views were conservative and nationalist and in 1920 he was elected to parliament. In the times of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia, Viktor Dyk was one of the prominent intellectual opponents of President Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk. In 1928 he married the writer Zdenka H√°skov√°. In the 1929 parliamentary election, Dyk became a senator of Czechoslovakia, representing the Czechoslovak Democratic Party.

It is located in the capital Yerevan. History On 31 January 1920, during the First Republic of Armenia, the People's University of Armenia opened in Alexandropol, with the presence of prime minister Alexander Khatisian and minister of culture and public education Nikol Aghbalian. In October of the same year, a decision was passed by then-minister of education Gevorg Ghazarian to establish the faculty of medicine in the university. However, due to political circumstances, the plan was never fulfilled. Armenia became a republic in December 1920. In 1920, the medical faculty of Yerevan was founded by the government of Armenia. On 25 May 1989 Yerevan State Medical University was named after the 12th-century Armenian physician Mkhitar Heratsi.  Campuses and hospitals  Heratsi Hospital The Medical University's campus is located in the center of the city on Koryun street. It is home to the following buildings: *Main university building *Administrative building *Laboratory building *Anatomical building *Dental clinics building Two hospitals operate under the jurisdiction of the Yerevan Medical University, where students complete practical experience. The Heratsi Hospital Complex No.1 is located near the university complex, while the Muratsan Hospital Complex is located in the Erebuni District of Yerevan.  Organization and Administration  The management of the Yerevan State Medical University is carried out according to legislation of the Republic of Armenia and the Charter of the University, on the basis of self-governance, in conjunction with the principles of sole management and collegiality. The university's governing bodies are the Council, the Rector, the Scientific Council, and the Rectorate. The council is composed of 32 members and is drawn from the University professoriate, students, representatives of the Armenian government, the Ministry of Education and Science. The primary objectives of the University Council are the selection of the university rector, the university's development as well as the major directions of international cooperation, with the rector's presentation. The Board also debates and approves the University budget. Faculties Currently, YSMU has seven faculties: * Faculty of General Medicine * Faculty Stomatology * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Public Health * Faculty of Military Medicine * Professional and Continuing Education Centre * Dean's Office of International Student's Education The chair of each faculty is the dean; the faculty committees manage each of them. The dean reports to the vice-Rector, who in turn reports to the rector. The current rector is Armen Muradyan, and the Chair of the Board is Armen Ashotyan.  Academics =Admission The University accepts applicants who have secondary (full), secondary vocational education with Armenian and foreign citizenship. There is no age limitation. Applicants should sit for written entrance exams in physics, chemistry and biology. They have a right to choose 2 out the 3 stated subjects. The results of admission examinations are confirmed by the decision of the Admissions Committee. Foreign students should give a qualification exam and submit the results with other required documents to the university.  Programs  The duration of the continuous and integrated educational program for bachelor's degree is six years in general medicine and military medical faculties and five years in the dental faculty. The duration of the Bachelor's Qualification Education Program is four years in the Faculty of Pharmacy. Master's degree is offered in the following specializations: * Medicine, * Public Health and Health Care * Pharmacy * Medical work in the armed forces The duration of the master's degree program in \\"Medical Work,\\" \\"Medical Work in the Armed Forces\\" is for two years; in \\"Public Health and Public Health\\" is 1,5 years, and is one year in Pharmacy.

The AR-7 was designed by American firearms designer Eugene Stoner, who is most associated with the development of the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle that was adopted by the US military as the M16. The civilian AR-7's intended markets today are backpackers and other recreational users as a takedown utility rifle. The AR-7 is often recommended for use by outdoor users of recreational vehicles (automobile, airplane or boat) who might have need for a weapon for foraging or defense in a wilderness emergency. History and design The prototype of what would become the AR-7 was designed by Eugene Stoner at ArmaLite Inc., a division of Fairchild Aircraft. The rifle shares some of the features of the bolt-action AR-5, another takedown rifle designed by Stoner for ArmaLite and adopted by the United States Air Force in 1956 as the MA-1.Pikula, Sam (Maj), The ArmaLite AR-10 Regnum Fund Press (1998), , p. 35 The MA-1 was intended to replace the M4 Survival Rifle and the M6 Aircrew Survival Weapon which was a superposed (\\"over-under\\") twin-barrel rifle/shotgun chambered in .22 Hornet and .410 bore, using a break-open action. The AR-5 had the advantage of repeat fire over the then-standard M6, using the same .22 Hornet cartridge. When the AR-5 was adopted as the MA-1 but was not placed in issue due to the numbers of usable M4 and M6 survival weapons in USAF inventory, ArmaLite used the research and tooling for the AR-5 in developing the AR-7 for the civilian market.Duncan Long, AR-7 Super Systems, Paladin Press, 1990. ArmaLite AR-7 Explorer internal parts assembled (left sideplate removed)The AR-7 uses a blowback semi-automatic action in .22 Long Rifle but retains the AR-5/MA-1 feature of storing the disassembled parts within the hollow stock, which is filled with plastic foam and capable of floating.Armalite history PDF AR5 flotation: Stevens, R. Blake & Edward C. Ezell. The Black Rifle: M16 Retrospective. Cobourg, Canada: Collector Grade Publications, 1987. (Page 22); AR7 flotation has consistently been mentioned as a selling point in advertisements since 1959. Like the bolt-action AR-5, the AR-7 was designed as a survival rifle for foraging small game for food. The AR-7 is constructed primarily of aluminum, with plastic for the stock, buttcap, and recoil spring guide. The bolt is steel. The original barrel was aluminum using a rifled steel liner; barrels of some production models have used all steel barrels, others have used barrels made of composite materials.AR-7 Survival Rifle The AR-7 measures 35 inches overall when assembled. It disassembles to four sections (barrel, action, stock, and magazine), with three parts storing inside the plastic stock, measuring 16 inches long. The rifle weighs 2.5 pounds, light enough for convenient backpacking. The rear sight is a peep sight, which comes on a flat metal blade with an aperture (in later production two different size apertures available by removing and flipping the rear sight), and is adjustable for elevation (up-down). The front sight is adjustable for windage (side-to-side). Accuracy is sufficient for hunting small game at ranges to 50 yards.  Performance  Reliability of the AR-7 is highly dependent on the condition of the magazine and on the ammunition used, perhaps more so than with other models of semi-automatic .22 caliber rifles. The feed ramp is part of the magazine and subject to damage from mishandling. Flat-nosed bullets tend to jam on the edge of the chamber of the barrel. The transition of cartridge from magazine to barrel can be smoothed by minor beveling of the chamber of the barrel, by using round-nosed as opposed to flat-nosed bullets and by paying attention to condition of the feed lips and feed ramp of the magazine. Later production magazines include an external wire spring to align the cartridge; earlier magazines used two pinch marks at the top of the magazine body, which in use could become sprung open or worn. All iterations of the AR-7 from the ArmaLite to the Henry U.S. Survival rifle use a bolt and dual recoil springs that are heavy compared to most other .22 semiautomatics. The AR-7 requires high velocity ammunition for reliable functioning. The manufacturers recommend use of 40 grain round nose bullets in high velocity loadings. It is possible to manually load a single round into the firing chamber, allowing use of flat nosed bullets or low velocity or subsonic ammunition. The barrel takedown nut tends to loosen during firing and may need hand-tightening to maintain both accuracy and reliability. ArmaLite sold the design to Charter Arms in 1973. According to some accounts posted by enthusiasts, this is when quality began to deteriorate.The Infamous AR7 Barrels were said to have a tendency to warp. Other sources state that the first production at Charter had problems which were corrected in later production runs.

The stock was a foam filled plastic shell with internal recesses for the receiver, barrel and one magazine and did not accept the receiver with a magazine in place. The original ArmaLite stock retained buoyancy longer than some later stocks by other makers. The receiver did not provide for a scope mount. The rear sight was a peep aperture, adjustable for elevation. The front sight was drift- adjustable for windage. Argentine variant The AR-7 was also manufactured in Argentina as the Sistema de Armas .22 LR Fire de Brenta.Sistema de Armas cal. 22 Lr \\"Fire\\" de Industrias Brenta Manual, at Full Aventura, FABRICAS ARGENTINAS de ARMAS database. It came with various barrel lengths, shrouds and fixed rifle stocks as well as pistol grips with retractable stocks.  Herter's Outdoor Supply  Herter's, Hy Hunter and American International Distributors marketed .22 replicas of the Broomhandle Mauser (as \\"Bolomauser\\"), Thompson submachine gun (as \\"T-62 Civilian Defense Model\\") and M1 Carbine made on AR-7 receivers and barrels.Hy Hunter Firearms Mfg. Co, Inc, advertisement , Guns magazine, Jan. 1962. Charter Arms AR-7 Explorer The Charter Arms AR-7 Explorer rifle replicated the ArmaLite AR-7 Explorer with variations in finish. Charter Arms Explorer II pistol Explorer II pistol with 8 inch barrel Explorer II was a pistol version of the AR-7.Charter Arms Explorer II It resembled a Broomhandle Mauser. The receiver had a built-in pistol grip with no provision for the rifle stock (the internal parts are interchangeable between rifle and pistol). The rear sight of the pistol was an open notch adjustable for windage and elevation. The Explorer II front sight was integral with the barrel shell and was not adjustable. The magazine well in front of the trigger guard would accept any magazine designed for the rifle. A spare 8-round magazine could be carried inside the grip. The most common barrel was six inches. Optional barrel lengths included eight and ten inches. =Legal note= Alignment lug is on barrel underside Because the U.S. 1934 NFA regulations set the minimum rifle barrel length at 16 inches, Charter Arms made the barrels of the Explorer I rifle and Explorer II pistol non-interchangeable to prevent installing the pistol barrel on the rifle. The AR-7 barrel has an alignment lug that mates a notch in the receiver. The rifle receiver notch and barrel lug are on top; the pistol notch and lug are broader and on the bottom. If a Charter Arms factory-made pistol barrel were installed on a rifle, the extractor on the bolt would be opposite the extractor slot in the barrel, preventing the bolt from closing (plus the front sight would be upside down). Modifying the pistol barrel to fit the rifle, or modifying the rifle receiver to accept the pistol barrel, would be \\"making a short barrel rifle\\" legally requiring federal registration on an ATF Form 1 with payment of a $200.00 tax. Conversely, after the Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co.,https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/504/505/case.html modifying the pistol to accept the rifle barrel and/or stock, or modifying the rifle barrel or stock to fit the pistol is legal so long as you do not have the rifle stock attached at the same time as the pistol barrel. It is legal (as a pistol) to have the rifle barrel attached with the pistol grip; there is no federal maximum pistol barrel length. In the United Kingdom this rifle is a section 1 firearm requiring a FAC AR-7 Industries AR-7 Industries made solid steel barrels much heavier than the AR-7 barrels by ArmaLite, Charter or Henry. Henry Survival Rifle In 1980, the design and production rights passed on to Henry Repeating Arms and the compact rifle was slightly revised, resulting in improved reliability and durability. The AR-7 is now (2018) known as the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 rifle. An ABS material replaced the original stock plastic, which was prone to cracking and failure. The receiver recess in the Henry stock allows storage of receiver with a magazine in place and the rifle is normally sold with two magazines. The latest versions of the Henry allow for storage of three magazines total, with two in the stock recess, and one in the receiver. The modern Henry U.S. Survival Rifle floats on water for a while either assembled or stored, although it is not entirely waterproof and will sink eventually. The rifles now include a full Teflon coating on the outer surface. Henry added a 3/8 inch Dovetail rail (aka Weaver .22 Tip-Off Mount rail) on the top of the receiver for attaching a wide variety of optics. Israeli pilot's survival rifle Another variant was made by ArmaLite and sold to the Israeli Military for use as pilot/aircrew survival weapons. The Israelis further modified these rifles, adding a telescoping stock, a pistol grip from a FAL-type rifle, shortening the barrel (to 13.5 inches), and adding a front sight based on the K98k Mauser. After Israeli service, some of these rifles were re-imported into the U.S. by Bricklee Trading Company (the barrels are marked with the BTC identification as required by U.S. laws on imported guns) for sale on the civilian market, and command a premium among collectors. In order to comply with U.S. Federal law, a 3-inch muzzle brake had to be permanently attached in order to meet the minimum 16-inch-barrel requirement. Operation The AR-7 functions as a simple or plain blowback semi-automatic. The AR-7 is a light firearm with heavy bolt and twin recoil springs. Aftermarket modifications The fact that both the barrel and stock are detachable has led to a plethora of after-market accessories, similar to those available for the Ruger 10/22. Barrels, stocks, and grips, of varying finishes and utility, can be added to the rifle. These include collapsible stocks, wire-framed stocks, pistol grips, flash suppressors, shrouded barrels, high- capacity magazines, telescopic sights, reflex 'red dot' sights and other occasionally fanciful-looking hardware, some at a cost greater than the rifle itself. Such accessories often make it impossible to use the original floating stock for storage of modified parts. The current Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 has a 3/8\\" scope sight rail integral with the receiver to accept standard Weaver- style \\"Tip-Off\\" rings. For earlier makes, B Square supplied the Charter Arms AR-7 Explorer Scope Mount Base, an accessory bracket with a 3/8\\" rail. The base attached by the receiver side plate screw (the Charter Arms side plate screw is longer than that of the ArmaLite). This base can be used on the ArmaLite and the Charter Arms Explorer rifles and the Charter Arms Explorer II pistol. However, with the base in place, the rifle receiver will no longer fit the recess in the stock for storage. (The base is not needed on the Henry version and will not fit the Henry receiver.) Apart from the highly modified AR-7 Israeli survival rifles, most AR-7 models lack provision for a carry sling. AR-7 owners have adapted slings designed for use on guns without modification, such as universal shotgun slings designed to cup the shotgun buttstock at the rear and clamp to the barrel or magazine tube at the front. Given the light weight of the AR-7, 2.5 pounds, a proper length of parachute cord with a slip knot at either end can be used as a sling or lanyard.

Biography Pujo was born near Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish to a French-born father. He practiced law in Lake Charles and was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1898 before he was elected as a Democrat in 1902. In 1908, he became a member of the National Monetary Commission, a body which sought to study foreign banking systems in search of ways to better the domestic banking system. In 1911, he was appointed to chair the House Committee on Banking and Currency. In 1912, he left the National Monetary Commission and obtained congressional authorization to form a separate committee, which came to be called the Pujo Committee, to investigate the \\"money trust\\". The Pujo Committee found that a cabal of financial leaders were abusing their public trust to consolidate control over many industries. Although Pujo left Congress in 1913, the findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, passage of the Federal Reserve Act that same year, and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914. They were also widely publicized in the Louis Brandeis book, Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It. While still a Congressman Pujo worked as a lumber company lawyer and helped suppress an IWW timber workers strike in 1912. Although the coroner charged the Galloway Lumber Company of Grabow, Louisiana with murder for shooting and killing three union strikers on July 7, 1912, the grand jury refused to indict and instead charged 58 union members with first degree murder. Pujo helped prosecute 9 but the jury returned a dismissal after 1 hour of deliberation and the remaining defendants were released.

In the United States, these protests marked a turning point for the civil rights movement, which produced revolutionary movements like the Black Panther Party. In reaction to the Tet Offensive, protests also sparked a broad movement in opposition to the Vietnam War all over the United States as well as in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. Mass movements grew not only in the United States but also elsewhere. In most Western European countries, the protest movement was dominated by students. The most spectacular manifestation of these were the May 1968 protests in France, in which students linked up with wildcat strikes of up to ten million workers, and for a few days the movement seemed capable of overthrowing the government. In many other countries, struggles against dictatorships, political tensions and authoritarian rule were also marked by protests in 1968, such as the beginning of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City, and the escalation of guerrilla warfare against the military dictatorship in Brazil. In the countries of Eastern Europe under communist parties, there were protests against lack of freedom of speech and violation of other civil rights by the Communist bureaucratic and military elites. In Central and Eastern Europe, there were widespread protests that escalated, particularly in the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia, in Warsaw, in Poland, and in Yugoslavia. Background Multiple factors created the protests in 1968. Many were in response to perceived injustice by governments, in the USA - the Johnson administration, and were in opposition to the draft, and the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. Post-war world Prague Spring of 1968 poster by the Young Union After World War II, much of the world experienced an unusual surge in births, creating a large age demographic. These babies were born during a time of peace and prosperity for most countries. This was the first generation to see televisions arrive in homes.Twenge, Ph. D., Jean. Generation Me. New York: Free Press, 2006. pg 6 Television had a profound effect on this generation in two ways. First, it gave them a common perspective from which to view the world. pg 19 The children growing up in this era shared not only the news and programs that they watched on television, they also got glimpses of each other's worlds. Secondly, television allowed them to experience major public events. Public education was becoming more widely attended, creating another shared experience. Chain stores and franchised restaurants were bringing shared shopping and dining experiences to people in different parts of the world. pg 12 The Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War was another shared experience of this generation. The knowledge that a nuclear attack could end their life at any moment was reinforced with classroom \\"duck and cover\\" bomb drills pg 32 creating an omnipresent atmosphere of fear. As they became older, the anti-war, civil rights, peace, and feminist movement for women's equality were becoming forces in much of the world. Social movements The Eastern Bloc had already seen several mass protests in the decades following World War II, including the Hungarian Revolution, the uprising in East Germany and several labor strikes in Poland, especially important ones in Pozna≈Ñ in 1956. Waves of social movements throughout the 1960s began to shape the values of the generation who were students during 1968. In America, the Civil Rights Movement was at its peak, and was at its most violent. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April by a white supremacist. In Northern Ireland, religious division paved the way for a decades-long violent, organised revolt against British governance. Italy and France were in the midst of a socialist movement. The New Left political movement was causing political upheavals in many European and South American countries. The Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict had already started. Great Britain's anti-war movement was very strong and African independence was a continuing struggle. In Poland in March 1968, student demonstrations at Warsaw University broke out when the government banned the performance of a play by Adam Mickiewicz (Dziady, written in 1824) at the Polish Theatre in Warsaw, on the grounds that it contained \\"anti-Soviet references\\". It became known as the March 1968 events. The women's liberation movement caused generations of females to question the global status quo of unequal empowerment of women, and the post-war baby boomer generation came to reassess and redefine their priorities about marriage and motherhood. The peace movement made them question authority more than ever before. pg 124 By the time they started college, the majority of young people identified with an anti-establishment culture, which became the impetus for the wave of rebellion and re-imagination that swept through campuses and throughout the world. College students of 1968 embraced progressive, liberal politics. Their progressive leanings and skepticism of authority were a significant impetus to the global protests of 1968. Dramatic events of the year in the Soviet Bloc revealed that the radical leftist movement was ambivalent about its relationship to communism.The 2‚Äì3 June 1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, were the first mass protest in the country after the Second World War. The authorities suppressed the protest, while President Josip Broz Tito had the protests gradually cease by giving in to some of the students‚Äô demands. Protests also broke out in other capitals of Yugoslav republics‚ÄîSarajevo, Zagreb and Ljubljana‚Äîbut they were smaller and shorter than in Belgrade.1968 in Europe - Online teaching and research guide, archived from the original In 1968, Czechoslovakia underwent a process known as the Prague Spring. In the August 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakian citizens responded to the attack on their sovereignty with passive resistance. Soviet troops were frustrated as street signs were painted over, their water supplies mysteriously shut off, and buildings decorated with flowers, flags, and slogans like, \\"An elephant cannot swallow a hedgehog.\\" Passers-by painted swastikas on the sides of Soviet tanks. Road signs in the country-side were over-painted to read, in Russian script, \\"–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞\\" (Moscow), as hints for the Soviet troops to leave the country. On 25 August 1968 eight Russian citizens staged a demonstration on Moscow's Red Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. After about five minutes, the demonstrators were beaten up and transferred to a police station. Seven of them received harsh sentences up to several years in prison. Protests Strikers in Southern France with a sign reading \\"Factory Occupied by the Workers.\\" Behind them is a list of demands The protests that raged throughout 1968 included a large number of workers, students, and poor people facing increasingly violent state repression all around the world. Liberation from state repression itself was the most common current in all protests listed below. These refracted into a variety of social causes that reverberated with each other: in the United States alone, for example, protests for civil rights, against nuclear weapons and in opposition to the Vietnam War, and for women's liberation all came together during this year.Rootes, Christopher. \\"1968 and the Environmental Movement in Europe.\\" . Retrieved 02-2008. Television, so influential in forming the political identity of this generation, became the tool of choice for the revolutionaries. They fought their battles not just on streets and college campuses, but also on the television screen with media coverage. As the waves of protests of the 1960s intensified to a new high in 1968, repressive governments through widespread police crack downs, shootings, executions and even massacres marked social conflicts in Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and China. In West Berlin, Rome, London, Paris, Italy, many American cities, and Argentina, labor unions and students played major roles and also suffered political repression. Mass movements Protest against the Vietnam War in West Berlin in 1968 The environmental movement can trace its beginnings back to the protests of 1968. The environmental movement evolved from the anti-nuclear movement. France was particularly involved in environmental concerns. In 1968, the French Federation of Nature Protection Societies and the French branch of Friends of the Earth were formed and the French scientific community organized Survivre et Vivre (Survive and Live). The Club of Rome was formed in 1968. The Nordic countries were at the forefront of environmentalism. In Sweden, students protested against hydroelectric plans. In Denmark and the Netherlands, environmental action groups protested about pollution and other environmental issues. The Northern Ireland civil rights movement began to start, but resulted in the conflict now known as The Troubles. In January, police used clubs on 400 anti-war/anti-Vietnam protesters outside of a dinner for U.S. Secretary of State Rusk. pg 42 In February, students from Harvard, Radcliffe, and Boston University held a four-day hunger strike to protest the Vietnam war. pg 54 10,000 West Berlin students held a sit-in against American involvement in Vietnam. People in Canada protested the Vietnam War by mailing 5,000 copies of the paperback, Manual for Draft Age Immigrants to Canada to the United States. pg 55 On March 6, 500 New York University (NYU) students demonstrated against Dow Chemical because the company was the principal manufacturer of napalm, used by the U.S. military in Vietnam.Surak, Amy. 1968 Timeline.

In August, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago was disrupted by five days of street demonstrations by thousands of protesters. Chicago's mayor escalated the riots with excessive police presence and by ordering up the National Guard and the army to suppress the protests. In September, the women's liberation movement gained international recognition when it demonstrated at the annual Miss America beauty pageant. The week-long protest and its disruption of the pageant gave the issue of equal rights for women significant attention and signaled the beginning of the end of \\"beauty pageants\\" as any sort of aspiration for young females.Freeman, Jo. \\"No More Miss America!

By March 11, the general public had joined the protest in violent confrontations with students and police in the streets. The government fought a propaganda campaign against the protestors, labeling them Zionists. The twenty days of protest ended when the state closed all of the universities and arrested more than a thousand students. Most Polish Jews left the country to avoid persecution by the government. pg 127  Pakistan  In November 1968, mass student movement erupted in Pakistan against the military dictatorship of Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan). The movement was later joined by workers, lawyers, white-collar employees, prostitutes, and other social layers. Unprecedented class solidarity was displayed and the prejudices of religion, sex, ethnicity, race, nationality, clan or tribe evaporated in the red heat of revolutionary struggle. In 1968 at the height of the movement against him, young protesters in Karachi and Lahore began describing him as a dog (Ayub Khan Kutta!). Troops opened fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds of students and workers. In March 1969, Ayub khan resigned and handed power to Army chief Yahya Khan. West Germany Student protest in West Berlin The German student movements were largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, particularly in relation to the poor living conditions of students. Students in 108 German universities protested to get recognition of East Germany, the removal of government officials with Nazi pasts and for the rights of students. pg 82 In February, protests by professors at the German University of Bonn demanded the resignation of the university's president because of his involvement in the building of concentration camps during the war.

The Student Union building would later be absorbed by the Stockholm School of Economics. Mexico Armored vehicles in the main square of Mexico City, circa 1968 Mexican university students mobilized to protest Mexican government authoritarianism and sought broad political and cultural changes in Mexico. The entire summer leading up to the opening of the 1968 Mexico City Olympics had a series of escalating conflicts between Mexican students with a broad base of non-student supporters and the police. Mexican president Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz saw the massive and largely peaceful demonstrations as a threat to Mexico's image on the world stage and to his government's ability to maintain order. On October 2, after a summer of protests against the Mexican government and the occupation of the central campus of the National Autonomous University (UNAM) by the army, a student demonstration in Tlatelolco Plaza in Mexico City ended with police, paratroopers and paramilitary units firing on students, killing and wounding an undetermined number of people.Jes√∫s Vargas Valdez, \\"Student Movement of 1968\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1379-1382.

The admittance of the South African team brought the issue of Apartheid to the 1968 Summer Olympics. After more than 40 teams threatened to boycott, the committee reconsidered and again banned the South African team. The Olympics were targeted as a high profile venue to bring the Black Movement into public view. At a televised medal ceremony, black U.S. track stars John Carlos and Tommie Smith each raised one black-gloved hand in the black power salute, and the U.S. Olympic Committee sent them home immediately, albeit only after the International Olympic Community threatened to send the entire track team home if the USOC didn't.

When marchers defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation. More than 100 people were injured, including a number of nationalist politicians. The incident was filmed by television news crews and shown around the world. It caused outrage among Catholics and nationalists, sparking two days of rioting in Derry between nationalists and the RUC.

Founded on the heels of successful record pools that would distribute disco and new wave records to DJs, the company applied the same principle to music video but with important differences. The videos, which were obtained from record labels both major and independent, were gathered into compilations. Clubs could subscribe and receive fresh tapes on a monthly basis. However the tapes had to be returned at the end of two months. Further conditions were dictated by copyright concerns. Clubs were not supposed to play the reels continuously but to mix them into other programming. The clubs were also mandated to provide monthly 'response forms' to RockAmerica from which the company produced a video chart, as well as more detailed analysis that could be purchased by marketers. The first program included videos by artists Madness, XTC, David Bowie, The Flying Lizards, The Ramones and Ian Dury. The company rapidly signed up a number of east coast clubs. The company also produced videos for a number of NYC artists including the Bush Tetras and, notably, the video for Madonna's debut single Everybody.

Pre-industrial is a time before there were machines and tools to help perform tasks en masse. Pre- industrial civilization dates back to centuries ago, but the main era known as the pre-industrial society occurred right before the industrial society. Pre- Industrial societies vary from region to region depending on the culture of a given area or history of social and political life. Europe was known for its feudal system and the Italian Renaissance. Common attributes * Limited production * Extreme agricultural economy * Limited division of labor. In pre- industrial societies, production was relatively simple and the number of specialized crafts was limited. * Limited variation of social classes * Parochialism‚ÄîCommunications were limited between communities in pre-industrial societies. Few had the opportunity to see or hear beyond their own village. Industrial societies grew with the help of faster means of communication, having more information at hand about the world, allowing knowledge transfer and cultural diffusion between them. * Populations grew at substantial rates Cipolla, Carlo M.

It is situated in Itaituba and Trair√£o municipalities, Par√° state, in the north region of Brazil. It is located in the watershed of the Tapaj√≥s River, about halfway between Manaus and Bel√©m. It has expanded since its inception and now covers . It is a very biodiverse habitat and contains a wide range of animals and plants. The specific objectives of the park are the preservation of various Amazonic ecosystems, through scientific, educational and recreational means. Geography The park lies on either side of the Tapaj√≥s River. The habitat is dense lowland rain forest and there are areas of white-sand grasslands beside the upper reaches of the Tapaj√≥s. This river rises in the Precambrian crystalline shields area of ancient igneous rock and carries little sediment. The river acts as a barrier so that some of the animals and plants on one bank are not found on the other. The first base in the park is about from Itaituba, and there is some illegal cutting of timber and gold mining in the eastern parts closest to Itaituba and Trair√£o. To the west the park adjoins the Pau-Rosa National Forest, created in 2001. The proposed South Amazon Ecological Corridor would link the park to other protected areas and indigenous territories in the region. History The Amaz√¥nia National Park was created by federal decree 73.683 of 19 February 1974. Its limits were altered by decree on 18 January 1985. The management plan was published on 31 December 1988, but was not made official at that time. The consultative council was created on 26 November 2004. The limits of the park were altered on 13 February 2006 and again on 12 August 2011. Law 12678 of 25 June 2012 amended the limits of the Amaz√¥nia, Campos Amaz√¥nicos and Mapinguari national parks, the Itaituba I, Itaituba II and Crepori national forests and the Tapaj√≥s Environmental Protection Area. All of these were reduced in size except the Campos Amaz√¥nicos. This last alteration reduced the area of the park to . Flora and fauna Except for about 2% of more open forest, the whole park consists of dense humid tropical forest. The larger trees reach a height of about , and the light filtering through the canopy is sufficient to produce a biodiverse understorey of vines, lichens, mosses and orchids. Many of the mammals in the park are nocturnal, and some such as the giant otter, Amazonian manatee and giant anteater are endangered. There are also large numbers of reptiles, fish and other aquatic creatures. Visiting the park The park can be reached from the city of Itaituba. The Trans-Amazonian Highway runs from east to west through the park but does not really live up to its name. The road is paved as far as Itaituba but other parts are unpaved earth roads topped with gravel that deteriorate during the rainy season, November to April, and need much repair work each May and June. The park can be accessed from Santar√©m, Par√°, which is at the confluence of the Tapaj√≥s with the Amazon River. Santar√©m has an airport. Any roads usually require four-wheel-drive vehicles and river transport is normally used in this region.

It was subdivided into 100 cents. History In 1865 Newfoundland adopted the gold standard, and the dollar replaced the pound at a rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence sterling or 1 pound = $4.80, slightly higher than the Canadian dollar (worth 4s 1.3d). The significance of this rating was that two cents would be equal to one penny sterling. It was seen as a compromise between adopting the British system or the American system. It also had the effect of aligning the Newfoundland unit to the dollar unit in the British Eastern Caribbean colonies. The West Indian dollar was directly descended from the Spanish Dollar (Pieces of Eight). Newfoundland was unique in the British Empire in that it was the only part to introduce its own gold coin in conjunction with its gold standard. Newfoundland two dollar coins were minted intermittently until the Newfoundland banking crash of 1894. In 1895, following this banking crisis, the Canadian banks moved into Newfoundland and the value of the Newfoundland dollar was adjusted to set it equal to the Canadian dollar, a devaluation of 1.4%. The Newfoundland dollar was replaced by the Canadian dollar at par when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, Volume C, Currency, p. 577. Centre for Newfoundland Studies Digital Archive, Memorial University. Retrieved July 19, 2012. The other British North American colonies adopted the American unit around the same time that Newfoundland adopted the West Indian unit. The small disparity between the American unit and the West Indian unit was because in 1792, Alexander Hamilton at the US treasury took an average weight of worn Spanish Dollars to be the new American unit of currency. The Newfoundland decimal coinage would have corresponded exactly to the dollar unit that was used in another British colony in South America. British Guiana used accounts based on the Spanish dollar, but these accounts were used in conjunction with the sterling coinage. Coins of the Newfoundland dollar continue to be legal tender in all of Canada up to the present day,Currency Act, RSC 1985, c. C-52, s. 7(1)(b). as are banknotes. Coins In 1865, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 cents, and 2 dollars. The 1 cent was struck in bronze, the 5, 10 and 20 cents in silver and the 2 dollars (also denominated as \\"Two Hundred Cents\\" and \\"One Hundred Pence\\") in gold. Silver 50 cents were introduced in 1870, with the 20 cents replaced by a 25-cent coin in 1917. A smaller 1-cent coin was introduced in 1938. Banknotes Union Bank $2 note In 1865, one chartered bank, the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland, began issuing notes denominated in pounds and dollars, using a rate of 4 dollars = 1 pound. As this rate matched the rate used in Canada at the time, it may be that these notes were not intended for use as Newfoundland dollars. In the 1880s, both the Commercial Bank and the Union Bank of Newfoundland issued notes denominated solely in dollars. Denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 dollars were issued. However, in 1894, both banks crashed. Treasury $2 note The Department of Public Works introduced government cash notes in 1901 in denominations of 40, 50 and 80 cents, 1 and 5 dollars. In 1910, 25 cents and 2 dollars were added. In 1920, the Treasury introduced 1- and 2-dollar notes.  Gold standard  The Newfoundland dollar was linked to the Canadian dollar and remained convertible to gold even after Canada went off the gold standard in April 1931. As a result of going off the gold standard and the economic situation of the Depression, the Canadian dollar slipped against the American dollar. That opened up the opportunity for a one- way arbitrage market with the United States. It became profitable to convert Canadian dollars for gold in Newfoundland and then take the gold to the United States to sell for a profit. This brought economic pressure on Newfoundland as its gold reserves started to diminish.James Hiller and Michael Harrington (eds.), The Newfoundland National Convention, 1946-1948: Reports and papers, p.377. In December 1931, the Newfoundland government took Newfoundland off the gold standard. This was followed by legislation in the spring of 1932, which amended the Currency Act to prohibit the export of gold without a permit. Banknotes became legal tender, and notes were no longer convertible into gold. Newfoundland thus abandoned the gold standard a year after Canada.An Act to make Provision for controlling the Export of Gold and for controlling the Currency, Statutes of Newfoundland 1932, c. 1.

It is defined by the HVR1 mutations 16224C and 16311C. Origin Haplogroup K is believed to have originated in the mid-Upper Paleolithic, between about 30,000 and 22,000 years ago. It is the most common subclade of haplogroup U8b. with an estimated age of c. 12,000 years BP. Distribution Projected spatial frequency distribution for haplogroup K. Haplogroup K appears in Central Europe, Southern Europe, Northern Europe, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, South Asia and West Asia and in populations with such an ancestry. Haplogroup K is found in approximately 10% of native Europeans. Overall the mtDNA haplogroup K is found in about 6% of the population of Europe and the Near East, but it is more common in certain of these populations. Approximately 16% of the Druze of Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, belong to haplogroup K. It is also found among 8% of Palestinians. Additionally, K reaches a level of 17% in Kurdistan.Lucia Simoni, Francesc Calafell, Davide Pettener, Jaume Bertranpetit, and Guido Barbujani, Geographic Patterns of mtDNA Diversity in Europe, American Journal of Human Genetics, vol. 66 (2000), pp. 262‚Äì278. Approximately 32% of people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are in haplogroup K. This high percentage points to a genetic bottleneck occurring some 100 generations ago. Ashkenazi mtDNA K clusters into three subclades seldom found in non-Jews: K1a1b1a, K1a9, and K2a2a. Thus it is possible to detect three individual female ancestors, who were thought to be from a Hebrew/Levantine mtDNA pool, whose descendants lived in Europe. A 2013 study however suggests these clades to instead originate from Western Europe. K appears to be highest in the Morbihan (17.5%) and P√©rigord-Limousin (15.3%) regions of France, and in Norway and Bulgaria (13.3%). The level is 12.5% in Belgium, 11% in Georgia and 10% in Austria and Great Britain. Haplogroup K is also found among Gurage (10%), Syrians (9.1%), Afar (6.3%), Zenata Berbers (4.11%),; S5 Table Reguibate Sahrawi (3.70%), Oromo (3.3%), Iraqis (2.4%), Saudis (0%-10.5%), Yemenis (0%-9.8%), and Algerians (0%-4.3%). Mtdna K was found in 0.9% of Beijing Han in a group of sampling. Ancient DNA Haplogroup K has been found in the remains of three individuals from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Tell Ramad, Syria, dating from c. 6000 BC. The clade was also discovered in skeletons of early farmers in Central Europe dated to around 5500-5300 BC, at percentages that were nearly double the percentage present in modern Europe. Some techniques of farming, together with associated plant and animal breeds, spread into Europe from the Near East. The evidence from ancient DNA suggests that the Neolithic culture spread by human migration.W. Haak, et al, \\"Ancient DNA from the First European Farmers in 7500-Year-Old Neolithic Sites\\", Science, vol. 310, no. 5750 (2005), pp. 1016-1018; B.

Bramanti et al, \\"Genetic Discontinuity Between Local Hunter-Gatherers and Central Europe‚Äôs First Farmers,\\" Science, (published online 3 Sep 2009). Analysis of the mtDNA of √ñtzi, the frozen mummy from 3300 BC found on the Austrian-Italian border, has shown that √ñtzi belongs to the K1 subclade. It cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade (K1a, K1b or K1c). The new subclade has provisionally been named K1√∂ for √ñtzi.Luca Ermini et al., \\"Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Tyrolean Iceman,\\" Current Biology, vol. 18, no. 21 (30 October 2008), pp. 1687-1693. Multiplex assay study was able to confirm that the Iceman's mtDNA belongs to a new European mtDNA clade with a very limited distribution amongst modern data sets.Endicott et al., \\"Genotyping human ancient mtDNA control and coding region polymorphisms with a multiplexed Single-Base-Extension assay: the singular maternal history of the Tyrolean Iceman,\\" BMC Genetics, vol. 10, no. 29 (19 June 2009). A woman buried some time between 2650 and 2450 BC in a presumed Amorite tomb at Terqa (Tell Ashara), Middle Euphrates Valley, Syria carried Haplogroup K.J. Tomczyk, et al., \\"Anthropological Analysis of the Osteological Material from an Ancient Tomb (Early Bronze Age) from the Middle Euphrates Valley, Terqa (Syria),\\" International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, published online ahead of print (2010). A lock of hair kept at a reliquary at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte Baume basilica, France, which local tradition holds belonged to the biblical figure Mary Magdalene, was also assigned to haplogroup K. Ancient DNA sequencing of a capillary bulb bore the K1a1b1a subclade, indicating that she was likely of Pharisian maternal origin. Haplogroup K1 has likewise been observed among specimens at the mainland cemetery in Kulubnarti, Sudan, which date from the Early Christian period (AD 550-800). In 2016, researchers extracted the DNA from the tibia of two individuals separately dated to 7288-6771 BCE and 7605-7529 BCE buried in Theopetra cave, Greece, the oldest known human-made structure, and both individuals were found to belong to mtDNA Haplogroup K1c. Haplogroup K has also been observed among ancient Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el- Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, which date from the Pre- Ptolemaic/late New Kingdom and Roman periods. Fossils excavated at the Late Neolithic site of Kelif el Boroud in Morocco, which have been dated to around 3,000 BCE, have likewise been observed to carry the K1 subclade.

The highway runs from Jacobs Road near Fort Meade east to MD 3 Business in Glen Burnie. MD 174 connects Glen Burnie with Severn and Fort George G. Meade in northern Anne Arundel County. The Fort Meade-Severn portion of the highway was constructed as part of MD 170, the primary highway that connected what was then Camp Meade to Baltimore, in the late 1910s. The highway was widened in the early 1940s, then became MD 554 in a number swap with the Severn-Odenton portion of MD 170. MD 174 was constructed in the early 1920s as a short road from MD 3 in Glen Burnie west to the site of the highway's modern Interstate 97 (I-97) interchange. MD 174 was extended west to Fort Meade in the early 1980s. Route description View west from the east end of MD 174 at MD 3 Bus. in Glen Burnie MD 174 begins on the eastern edge of the Fort Meade military reservation at an intersection with Jacobs Road. Reece Road continues as a federal government-maintained public road west onto the military installation to an intersection with MD 175. MD 174 heads northeast along Reece Road, a two-lane undivided road that passes between residential subdivisions in the western part of Severn. The highway veers north then curves east and crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which also carries MARC's Penn Line. Immediately to the east, MD 174 passes through an S-curve and temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its intersection with MD 170 (Telegraph Road). The highway continues east as Donaldson Avenue, which reduces to two lanes. MD 174 enters the southwestern part of Glen Burnie and veers northeast at its junction with Quarterfield Road, at which point the highway assumes that name and expands to a four-lane undivided road. The highway temporarily becomes divided through its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-97. East of I-97, MD 174 meets the eastern end of a piece of its old alignment, Old Quarterfield Road, which is unsigned MD 779. The highway temporarily gains a median again as it passes through its half-diamond interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The interchange only allows access from MD 174 to eastbound MD 100 and from westbound MD 100 to MD 174. North of that interchange, the highway intersects Thelma Avenue and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway). There is no direct access from northbound MD 3 Business to westbound MD 174; that movement is made via Thelma Avenue. History When the Maryland State Roads Commission applied numbers to state highways, they assigned MD 170 to its current corridor from Severn to Brooklyn Park and to what is now MD 174 from Severn to Fort Meade. The portion of the modern highway from Odenton to Severn was originally MD 554. A section of highway from the current MD 170-MD 174 intersection in Severn west to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) was built as a wide concrete road by 1915. Construction on the highway from Linthicum to Fort Meade became a high priority with the United States' entrance into World War I; the remainder of the Severn- Linthicum highway and the highway from the railroad at Severn southwest to newly established Camp Meade, now collectively called the Camp Meade Road, were paved in wide concrete between 1916 and 1919. MD 170 was relocated at the railroad crossing when the highway's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed in 1931. The old road, which is now Severn Station Road west of the tracks and Old Camp Meade Road to the east, became MD 483. With the outbreak of World War II, MD 170 was designated a road of strategic importance to connect Baltimore with Fort Meade; the highway was reconstructed as a wide asphalt-surfaced concrete road in 1942. By 1946, MD 170 and MD 554 had swapped numbers, with the latter now the route from Severn to Fort Meade. MD 554 was widened and resurfaced again in 1955 and 1956. The original segment of MD 174 was paved as a concrete road by 1921. This segment extended west from MD 3 in Glen Burnie southwest along Quarterfield Road to a spot just west of what became its partial cloverleaf interchange with the Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) in 1956. MD 174 was relocated for the construction of the interchange; part of the old road became MD 779. MD 174 was extended east from MD 3 Business along Aquahart Road and south along Oakwood Road to its interchange with MD 177 (now MD 100) in 1969. The state highway was rolled back to its present terminus at MD 3 Business by 1974. Donaldson Avenue, a county highway, was relocated near its western end to form a four-way intersection with MD 170 and MD 554 in 1981. In 1983, MD 174 was extended west over Quarterfield Road, Donaldson Avenue, and MD 554 to its present western terminus at the edge of Fort Meade. The state highway had been expanded to a four-lane divided highway around its intersection with MD 170 and its interchange with MD 100, and widened to four lanes on much of its Quarterfield Road segment by 1999. MD 174 was expanded from a two-lane road to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with I-97 when that interchange was reconstructed in 2004 and 2005.

After being invaded by European explorers in the 18th century, by the 20th and 21st century, the islands were incorporated into Samoa (Western Samoa, Independent Samoa) and American Samoa (Eastern Samoa).  Early history of the Polynesian people of Samoa  The pre-Western history of Eastern Samoa (now American Samoa) is inextricably bound with the history of Western Samoa (now independent Samoa). The Tui Manu'a is one of the oldest Samoan titles in Samoa. Traditional oral literature of Samoa and Manu'a talks of a widespread Polynesian network or confederacy (or \\"empire\\") that was prehistorically ruled by the successive Tui Manu'a dynasties. Manuan genealogies and religious oral literature also suggest that the Tui Manu'a had long been one of the most prestigious and powerful paramounts Samoa. Legends suggest that the Tui Manu'a kings ruled a confederacy of far-flung islands which included Fiji, Tonga as well as smaller western Pacific chiefdoms and Polynesian outliers such as Uvea, Futuna, Tokelau, and Tuvalu. Commerce and exchange routes between the western Polynesian societies is well documented and it is speculated that the Tui Manu'a dynasty grew through its success in obtaining control over the oceanic trade of currency goods such as finely woven ceremonial mats, whale ivory \\"tabua\\", obsidian and basalt tools, chiefly red feathers, and seashells reserved for royalty (such as polished nautilus and the egg cowry). The islands of Tutuila and Aunu'u were politically connected to 'Upolu island in what is now independent Samoa. It can be said that all the Samoa islands are politically connected today through the faamatai chiefly system and through family connections that are as strong as ever. This system of the faamatai and the customs of faasamoa originated with two of the most famous early chiefs of Samoa, who were both women and related, Nafanua and Salamasina.  Arrival of Western missionaries  Early Western contact included a battle in the 18th century between French explorers and islanders in Tutuila, for which the Samoans were blamed in the West, giving them a reputation for ferocity. Early 19th century Rarotongan missionaries to the Samoa islands were followed by a group of Western missionaries led by John Williams of the (Congregationalist) London Missionary Society in the 1830s, officially bringing Christianity to Samoa. Less than a hundred years later, the Samoan Congregationalist Church became the first independent indigenous church of the South Pacific.  European and American Colonial Division of the Samoan archipelago  Queen Emma was a business woman of mixed American/Samoan descent In 1872 the high chief of the tribes of the eastern Samoan islands gave America permission to establish a naval base in exchange for military protection. In 1878 the U.S. Navy built a coaling station on Pago Pago Bay for its Pacific Squadron and appointed a local Secretary. American Samoa is the result of the Second Samoan Civil War and an agreement made between Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom in the Tripartite Convention of 1899. The international rivalries were settled by the 1899 Treaty of Berlin in which Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan archipelago. The eastern Samoan islands became territories of the United States and later became known as American Samoa. The U.S. formally occupied its portion, with the noted harbor of Pago Pago, the following year. The western islands are now the independent state of Samoa.  Colonization by the United States  Several chiefs of the island of Tutuila swore allegiance, and ceded the island, to the United States in the Treaty of Cession of Tutuila of 1900. The last sovereign of Manu ªa, the Tui Manu ªa Elisara, signed the Treaty of Cession of Manu ªa of 1904 following a series of US Naval trials, known as the \\"Trial of the Ipu\\", in Pago Pago, Ta ªu, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat. The treaties were ratified by the United States in the Ratification Act of 1929. After World War I, during the time of the Mau movement in Western Samoa (then a New Zealand protectorate), there was a corresponding American Samoa Mau movement, led by Samuel Sailele Ripley, who was from Leone village and was a World War I war veteran. In 1921, seventeen chiefs of the American Samoa Mau were arrested and imprisoned under hard labor. During World War II, U.S. Marines in American Samoa outnumbered the local population, having a huge cultural influence. Young Samoan men from the age of 14 and above were combat trained by US military personnel. As in World War I, American Samoans served in World War II as combatants, medical personnel, code personnel, ship repairs, etc.  Current status of the territory and attempts of incorporation in the United States  After the war, Organic Act 4500, a U.S. Department of Interior-sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was defeated in Congress, primarily through the efforts of American Samoan chiefs, led by Tuiasosopo Mariota. These chiefs' efforts led to the creation of a local legislature, the American Samoa Fono which meets in the village of Fagatogo, the territory's capital. In time, the Navy-appointed governor was replaced by a locally elected one. Although technically considered \\"unorganized\\" in that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a constitution that became effective on July 1, 1967. The U.S. Territory of American Samoa is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The islands have been reluctant to separate from the US in any manner. The maritime boundaries of American Samoa with New Zealand (Tokelau, the Cook Islands, and Niue) have been determined in a series of treaties. Maritime boundaries with Tonga and Samoa have yet to be agreed upon  Economy of American Samoa  Employment on the island basically falls into three relatively equally sized categories of approximately 5,000 workers each: the public sector, the tuna cannery, and the rest of the private sector. There are only a few federal employees in American Samoa and no active military personnel (there are several Army Reserve units including companies of the famed 100th Infantry Battalion (United States)); the overwhelming majority of public sector employees work for the American Samoa Government. The StarKist cannery exports several hundred million dollars worth of canned tuna to the United States.  See also  * Outline of American Samoa * ReferencesFurther reading * Campbell, Charles S.

Friedrichsruh manor is known as a residence of the Bismarck noble family, mainly of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck from 1871 onwards.  History  In the 18th century, the extended Sachsenwald forest in Saxe-Lauenburg east of Hamburg was a favoured hunting ground for Count Frederick of Lippe (1706‚Äì1781). In 1763 he had a lodge erected in the woods, named Friedrichsruh (\\"Frederick's Rest\\"), which upon his death changed hands several times. In the early 19th century, the premises were rebuilt as a country inn and guesthouse, which after the opening of the Hamburg-Berlin railway line running nearby became a popular destination for Hamburg citizens. Bismarck and Emperor Wilhelm II in Friedrichsruh, 1888 After the victory over France and the German unification of 1871, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck received the Sachsenwald estates as a present from Emperor William I. Bismarck had the former inn restored as a manor house and retained the name of Friedrichsruh. After his death he was entombed in the Bismarck Mausoleum on the Schneckenberg hill, just outside Friedrichsruh, on 16 March 1899. In the last days of World War II, in 1945, Friedrichsruh manor was destroyed during a RAF raid due to the (false) rumor that Heinrich Himmler was hiding there. Actually, it served as the headquarters of the Swedish White Buses rescue programme led by Folke Bernadotte, clearly visible by Red Cross markings on its roof. After the war, the premises were rebuilt at the behest of Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck (1897‚Äì1975). Some of his descendants still live there.

P. Lovecraft. It was written in 1920, and published in October 1921 in The Tryout. Set in ancient Greece, the story concerns two sculptors who accept a commission with ironic consequences. Lovecraft wrote \\"The Tree\\" early in his career. He was dismissive of the story in a 1936 letter. Such stories, he said, \\"if typed on good stock make excellent shelf-paper, but little else.\\" The assessment of Lovecraft authority S. T. Joshi was that although the story \\"may be a trifle obvious‚Ä¶ it is an effective display of Lovecraft's skill in handling a historical setting.\\" Plot This olive tree on the Greek island of Ithaca is believed to be more than 1500 years old. On a slope of Mount Maenalus in Arcadia is an olive grove that grows around a marble tomb and the ruin of an old villa. There, one gigantic tree resembles a frighteningly distorted man, and the roots of the tree have shifted the blocks of the tomb. The narrator explains that the beekeeper who lives next door told him a story about the tree: Two renowned sculptors, Kalos and Musides, lived in the colonnaded villa, which was \\"resplendent\\" in its day. Both men created works that were widely known and celebrated. They were devoted friends, but different in disposition: Musides enjoyed the nightlife, while Kalos preferred the quiet of the olive grove. It was there he was said to receive his inspiration. One day, emissaries from \\"the Tyrant of Syracuse\\" ask the sculptors each to create a statue of Tych√© (). The statue, they are told, must be \\"of great size and cunning workmanship\\", since it is to be \\"a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers.\\" The most beautiful statue will be erected in the Tyrant's city, Syracuse. Kalos and Musides accept the commission. Secretly, the Tyrant expects the sculptors not only to compete but to cooperate, resulting in statuary that will be truly magnificent. The work proceeds, and although Musides is still social and active, he seems morose‚Äîapparently because Kalos has fallen ill. Despite Kalos' weakened state, his visitors detect in him a serenity that contrasts Musides' dismay. Despite the efforts of his doctors and his friend Musides, Kalos weakens. When Kalos' death seems imminent, Musides weeps and promises to carve for him an elaborate marble sepulchre. Kalos asks that twigs from specific olive trees in the grove be buried near his head. Soon after, Kalos dies in the olive grove. Musides builds the tomb and buries the olive twigs. From the burial place of the twigs an enormous olive tree grows at an incredible rate. An especially large branch hangs over the villa and Musides' statue. Three years later, Musides' work on the statue is complete. The Tyrant's agents arrive, then head to town to stay the night. That evening, a windstorm whips down the mountain. When the Tyrant's people return to the villa the next morning, they find it utterly destroyed; the great tree branch has fallen, and Musides' statue has been crushed into unrecognizable pieces. Musides himself is nowhere to be found. The end of the story recalls the Latin aphorism that precedes the text: \\"Fata viam invenient\\" (\\"fate will find a way\\").

The character first appeared in DC Comics Presents #87 (November 1985) and was created by Elliot S! Maggin and Curt Swan (based upon the original Superboy character by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster). Superboy- Prime is from a parallel Earth called Earth-Prime, devoid of any superheroes, or even superhumans. There, Superman and the other comic superheroes were fictional characters, as they were in real life. The Earth-Prime universe was erased during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Superboy-Prime ended up in a \\"paradise\\" dimension where during that time, he found himself unable to let go of his former life and destiny as Earth's greatest hero. Over time, his convictions and morals become twisted and warped, and he came to believe that Earth-Prime is the only proper Earth and that Superboy-Prime was the only one worthy of the Superboy mantle. Prime firmly believes that being Superman is his calling despite the fact that he has become a psychotic, murderous, and even sadistic villain. His overwhelming strength, speed, unpredictability, and ruthlessness make him one of the most dangerous foes in the DC Universe. The name \\"Superman-Prime\\" was first used by Grant Morrison in DC One Million (1998) for the mainstream Superman in the 853rd century (he is essentially the same Superman from the All-Star Superman storyline).

He is the adopted son of Jerry and Naomi Kent. Naomi wanted to name their infant son Clark, after her maiden name, but Jerry, knowing he will also be named like Superman, a fictional comic book character, initially refused, but finally gave in. What the Kents do not know is that the baby, found abandoned in a forest, is actually a young Kal-El, who has been teleported to Earth by his father Jor-El moments before the planet Krypton was destroyed when its red sun went supernova. His parents were unable to escape that way due to a member of the Kryptonian council bursting into the room and using the device, although it is unknown what happened to him. Young Clark lives the first fifteen years of his life as a normal boy. However, one night, as he attends a Halloween costume party dressed as Superboy, the passage of Halley's Comet overhead triggers his Kryptonian powers. At the same time, the Earth-One Superman finds his way to Earth Prime and the two Supermen meet. Superboy-Prime uses his powers to stop a tidal wave.DC Comics Presents #87 (November 1985). DC Comics.

Alexander comes to believe that the reason behind Lois's failing health is the paradise dimension itself, and he persuades Superboy-Prime to help him return to reality by showing Superboy-Prime the negative aspects of the post-Crisis Earth. Superboy-Prime hesitates until he overhears Kal-L say, \\"I wish this world would let him grow up. He'll never be Superman here\\".

During a battle between Alexander Luthor and the heroes freed from his tower, Superboy-Prime appears, wearing a power suit modeled after the Anti-Monitor's armor, which constantly feeds him yellow solar energy and boosts his power levels. During the battle, Black Adam discovers that magic has little effect against Superboy-Prime. Superboy-Prime knocks Adam away from the tower, and his opponent is transported to Earth-S. Superboy-Prime insists that Luthor reinstate Earth Prime as the only existing Earth. After Superboy-Prime attempts to kill Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark), an enraged Conner Kent attacks him. Conner and Superboy-Prime's battle sends them both headlong into Alexander Luthor's vibrational tuning fork with the effects causing the machine to explode and resulting in the alternate Earths merging into one.

Alexander and Superboy-Prime join the Battle of Metropolis and quarrel about their contingency plan. Since their tower has been destroyed, Alexander is prepared to settle for taking over New Earth instead of creating a perfect Earth. Upon hearing of the new plan, Superboy-Prime refuses to help him, as he believes New Earth to be hopelessly inferior. When Batman, Wonder Woman, Kal-El, and Kal-L arrive to save Metropolis, Kal-L confronts Alex about his role in the destruction. Meanwhile, Superboy-Prime is attacked by Bart Allen, who has been left outraged by Conner's death. Superboy-Prime escapes Bart and flies toward the planet Oa, intending to destroy it and spark another Big Bang which would recreate the universe with himself as the sole hero.

The heat melts away Superboy-Prime's armor and severely weakens all three Kryptonians, who then crash on Mogo. Superboy-Prime beats Kal-L to death, but is then attacked by Kal-El. Superboy-Prime claims that he is better than Kal-El and that his Krypton was superior to Kal-El's. Kal-El responds, \\"It's not about where you were born. Or what powers you have. Or what you wear on your chest. It's about what you do... It's about action.\\" Although nearly powerless, Kal-El knocks Superboy-Prime out before collapsing himself, but members of the Green Lantern Corps manage to save Kal-El.

DC Comics. When the Sinestro Corps attack Oa, Superboy-Prime is released from his imprisonment and joins them. He becomes one of the Anti-Monitor's heralds, and he wears the uniform of the Sinestro Corps along with a variant of the power suit he wore during Infinite Crisis.Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 (August 2007). DC Comics. Calling himself Superman-Prime (in part due to the legal disputes over the Superboy name), he arrives on Earth and battles a large group of heroes while flashing back on his life so far. He reveals that he did not believe Sinestro when he said that the Multiverse has been restored, and has only gone along with the Anti-Monitor's plans so that he may one day get revenge on him for the destruction of Earth Prime. Superman, Power Girl, and Supergirl arrive and stop him, only to have him escape as the sun rises, restoring his powers.Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Superman- Prime (October 2007).

Superman-Prime gets the upper hand over Yat by exposing him to lead, and defeats him.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #18 (November 2007). DC Comics. When the Anti-Monitor is wounded by the Guardians and the destruction of War World, Superman-Prime impatiently flies through his chest and throws him into space, then battles both the Sinestro Corps and Green Lantern Corps, until a Guardian willingly sacrifices himself to destroy Superman-Prime. However, instead of dying, Prime is infused with Oan energy and warped back into the multiverse.Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 (December 2007). DC Comics. Countdown to Final Crisis Superman-Prime on the cover of Countdown to Final Crisis #14. Art by Pete Woods. In Countdown to Final Crisis, following the conclusion of the Sinestro Corps War, Superman-Prime is shown wearing a costume similar to the black suit worn by Superman shortly after his resurrection and has discovered the existence of the new Multiverse, traversing it in the hopes of finding Earth Prime. He arrives on Earth-15 and attacks that world's Lex Luthor, blaming him for Alexander Luthor's failure to make the universe \\"perfect\\".Countdown to Final Crisis #26 (October 2007). DC Comics. He promptly kills that world's heroes and destroys the planet.Countdown to Final Crisis #24 (November 2007). DC Comics. He then flies to his new base of operations in the Source Wall where he had been torturing Mister Mxyzptlk into helping him recreate Earth Prime. It is revealed that Superman-Prime is 19 years old. According to Mxyzptlk, his growth is the temporary side effect of his cells absorbing vast Oan energy from his last \\"encounter\\". Mxyzptlk escapes with the help of another prisoner, Annataz Arataz, an alternate version of Zatanna from Earth-3. Annataz is killed when Superman-Prime grows angry and gives up on using magic to achieve his goals.Countdown to Final Crisis #31 (September 2007). DC Comics.Countdown to Final Crisis #23 (November 2007). DC Comics. He appears on the Monitors' satellite headquarters and threatens Solomon to help him find Earth Prime.Countdown to Final Crisis #16 (January 2008). DC Comics. Solomon tells him that if he releases Forerunner, he will show Prime what he wants; Prime does so.Countdown to Final Crisis #15 (January 2008). DC Comics. Solomon then tells Prime that Earth-51 is his perfect Earth, and it is in ruins due to the fighting between Monarch's Army, the Earth-51 heroes, and the Challengers. Prime leaves the satellite, intending to confront Monarch.Countdown to Final Crisis #14 (January 2008). DC Comics. Superman-Prime fights with Monarch, finding out that this is an enemy who is on his level despite his boosted powers from the Guardian. The two seem evenly matched until Prime becomes slightly injured after Monarch exposes part of his suit and releases some of his massive contained energies. In a fit of rage, Superman-Prime redoubles his attack on Monarch and rips open the chestplate of Monarch's containment armor, resulting in a huge explosion of quantum energy that seems to destroy the entire universe of Earth-51.Countdown to Final Crisis #13 (January 2008). DC Comics. Legion of 3 Worlds Superboy-Prime as the Time Trapper from Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #4. Art by George P√©rez. Shortly after the events of Geoff Johns' Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes storyline, the Time Trapper finds Superboy-Prime lost in time. He decides to use him to destroy the Legion and sends him to the 31st century, where he crashes in a farm outside of Smallville.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #1 (August 2008). DC Comics. He appears much younger than he did when he was last seen in Countdown to Final Crisis, having used up the power he had absorbed from the dying Guardian. He encounters the elderly couple who own the farm, and they refer to him as Superboy, which enrages him. After being shot, he kills the farming couple, makes his way into Smallville, and visits the Superman Museum, where he discovers that he is regarded as merely a footnote in Superman's history, and ultimately has no impact on history. This sends him into a tantrum, in which he wrecks the museum and kills security guards and police officers. In the middle of his tantrum, the museum tour guide (a holographic recreation of Jimmy Olsen) tells Prime of the Legion of Super-Villains. He learns that the evil Legion followed a code of evil, inspired by a dark being whose \\"name was never spoken\\". Prime, resolved to be a villain with more of an impact than any other enemy of Superman, sets out for the prison planet of Takron-Galtos, and frees Lightning Lord, Saturn Queen, and Cosmic King. Unlike most denizens of the 31st century, they all recognize Prime and seem overjoyed to see him. The dialogue seems to imply that Prime was the dark being whose example the villains follow. After freeing the prisoners, Prime burns a huge S shield into the prison planet, determined to turn the shield from a symbol of hope into a symbol of terror. Learning of the prison break, the Legion of Super-Heroes call Superman from the 21st century. Superman, and the historical records, implies that no one from New Earth is aware of what happened to Prime after the Sinestro Corps War. Superman and Brainiac 5 decide to bring in two other versions of the Legion to combat Prime and the new Legion of Super-Villains, with Superman convinced the only way to neutralize the threat of Prime is to redeem him. Superboy-Prime led his Legion of Super-Villains to Sorcerer's World, where he recruits Mordru and kills Rond Vidar (the last Green Lantern) before heading to Earth.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (October 2008). DC Comics. During the war between the Legions of Super-Heroes and the Legion of Super-Villains, Prime battles several opponents with whom he has a history. First, the immortal Sodam Yat (the last Guardian of the Universe) is persuaded to end his self-imposed retirement on Oa to battle Superboy-Prime. Then Bart Allen returns from the Speed Force, wearing the Kid Flash uniform that he had not worn since fighting Prime in Infinite Crisis.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #3 (February 2009). DC Comics. Soon after, Conner Kent (Superboy) enters the battle, his corpse dug up by Starman in the present and placed in a Kryptonian restoration chamber for the past 1000 years. The resurrections of Kid Flash and Superboy are part of a master contingency plan devised long before by Brainiac 5, who was forewarned of Superboy-Prime by one of Dream Girl's prophecies.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #4 (April 2009). DC Comics. During the battle, Prime kills two Legionnaires whose abilities manage to hurt him: Sun Boy of Earth Prime's \\"Threeboot Legion\\", who uses red solar powers; and Element Lad of Earth Prime, who managed to turn the ground around Prime into green kryptonite of the Earth Prime universe. During the battle, Superman, Lightning Lad, Cosmic Boy, and Saturn Girl are brought to the end of time by the Time Trapper, who then attacks them. During the fight, the Trapper is revealed to be an aged Superboy-Prime. The elder Superboy-Prime states that he became an anomaly that could not be killed after being shunted into the multiverse by the Guardians of the Universe and became the sole survivor of all creation. Back on Earth, Conner quickly begins gaining the upper-hand against Prime. Using his heat-vision, Conner manages to create a deep wound across the S-shield that Prime had carved into his chest. Meanwhile, at the end of time, the same wound appears on Time Trapper's chest. Realizing that Time Trapper's past is directly connected to his future, Saturn Girl uses the Time Trapper's time portals to recruit every Legion across the multiverse, who fight and defeat the Time Trapper. Superman and the three Legion founders transport him to the 31st Century, where the Trapper faces his younger self. Superboy-Prime and Trapper start bickering which culminates with their mutual destruction after Prime attacks Time Trapper, creating a paradox. The paradox created by Prime attacking himself returns him to Earth-Prime. To his dismay, his girlfriend and family have read Infinite Crisis, Sinestro Corps War, Countdown to Final Crisis, and Legion of 3 Worlds, and are now terrified of him. Prime lives in his parents' basement, who support him out of fear for what he might do to them. He spends his days collecting comic books and trolling the DC Comics message boards, remarking that the DCU will never be rid of him and that he \\"always survives.\\" Despite the physical depletion of his powers, his eyes begin glowing red again.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (July 2009). DC Comics. Blackest Night The last scene of Superboy- Prime in Adventure Comics #5. Art by Jerry Ordway. Superboy-Prime continues to live his secluded life, unknowingly but constantly monitored by the prime universe Brainiac 5, still compulsively reading every comic book and message board post pertaining to the DC multiverse. The extended cool-off period forced on him has left Clark more regretful, aware of his reputation as a joke character in the eyes of the people of Earth-Prime. Upon reading Adventure Comics #4, and the online solicitations for the two-part storyline possibly dealing with his death, he embarks with his fearful parents on a wild goose chase, hoping to find a comic book store willing to sell him a copy of the fifth issue. However, since the fifth issue is not yet on the shelves, the events unfold exactly as Clark already read them, with Alexander Luthor, multiversal-hopping Black Lantern, bestowing to him his Superboy-Prime powers in order to bring him to a higher emotional state. Upon calling forth Superboy's victims, he teasingly reveals to him his impending death in Adventure Comics #5.Adventure Comics vol. 2 #4 (November 2009). DC Comics. Unable to damage the Black Lanterns, Superboy-Prime flies to the DC Comics building in New York and attempts to take revenge on the writers he believes made him the way he is. Before he can do so, Alexander teleports him to his basement, and begins destroying his comic collection.Adventure Comics vol. 2 #5 (December 2009). DC Comics. Superboy-Prime then accepts the hopelessness of his situation, and willingly puts on a black ring, which wills him to \\"die\\". However, the ring, reacting to his mixed emotions, switches between the powers of the emotional spectrum, resulting in a mixed-light burst that eradicates the Black Lanterns and the ring itself. Lying on the floor, he becomes overcome by the emotions forced by the ring and devastated that \\"they\\" have turned him into a monster and made it so he cannot ever have a \\"happy ending.\\" Laurie enters the basement, sporting a broken arm. She comforts Prime, telling him that \\"they\\" heard him, and that they sent her to tell him that they are sorry for what they did to him, and are going to leave him alone‚Äî\\"they\\" previously mentioned as being the writers at DC Comics. As they embrace, a Black Lantern ring is shown on Laurie's hand that detects the hope within Prime's heart. Legion of Doom During a battle with the Teen Titans, a young villain named Headcase opens up a wormhole that accidentally transports Superboy-Prime back to New Earth. Enraged by his separation from Laurie, Superboy-Prime vows to destroy the Teen Titans and find a possible way to return home. He subsequently assembles a cadre of young supervillains consisting of Headcase, Zookeeper, Indigo, Sun Girl, Persuader (Elise Kimble) and a new Inertia, each of whom have a personal grudge against the Teen Titans.Teen Titans vol. 3 #98 (July 2011). DC Comics. Superboy-Prime also brings three clones of Superboy (formed from the remains of Match), and he uses them to assist in the attack on the Titans. Superboy-Prime and his team attempt to destroy Titans Tower, but are met by the large group of former Teen Titans.Teen Titans vol. 3 #99 (August 2011) Superboy-Prime is brought down by the combined might of the reserve Teen Titans, and then Superboy and Supergirl imprison him within the Source Wall.Teen Titans vol. 3 #100 (August 2011). DC Comics. DC Rebirth In the \\"DC Rebirth,\\" Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind head to the Monsterlands' Dungeon of Eternity to free the Monster Society of Evil. As King Kid fights the Shazam Family, Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind find that Superboy-Prime is trapped inside a small prison cell as he states to Mister Mind that he can hear what he is saying. He even asks the readers how they can still be reading comic books since the last time they interacted. Superboy-Prime even states that he has plans for Billy Batson when he gets out.Shazam! Vol. 3 #10 (January 2020). DC Comics. When Mister Mind had Doctor Sivana stab his magic eye with a magic dagger, Superboy-Prime senses that the Monster Society of Evil are being freed as he demands that Mister Mind releases him as well. When Dummy arrives while displeased that he was left behind after swimming all the way to the Dungeon of Eternity, Superboy-Prime states to Dummy that he can get him out in exchange for removing the little red sun outside of his prison. Dummy does so and is double-crossed by Superboy-Prime who uses his heat beams on Dummy. Superboy-Prime then begins his plans to go after Billy Batson.Shazam (vol. 3) #11 (February 2020). DC Comics.Shazam! Vol. 3 #11 (February 2020). DC Comics. As a Mister Mind- controlled C.C. Batson has Shazam cast the spell to unite the Seven Magiclands, Superboy-Prime is shown wandering the Monsterlands as he asks the readers if they know how to get out of the Monsterlands.Shazam (vol. 3) #13 (July 2020). DC Comics. Superboy-Prime crashes the fight between the Shazam Family and the Monster Society of Evil where he uses his fists to impale Scapegoat. Then he states to Red Queen that he will have some fun first before he gets serious. When Shazam punches Mister Mind's talkbox enough to emit magical energy that knocks out the Monster Society of Evil, Superboy-Prime feels it. When Shazam starts to work to undo Mister Mind's spell, Superboy- Prime interferes and defeats the Shazam Family until only Shazam remains standing. Free of the spell that affected him, Black Adam joins the fight and asks for Shazam to cast the spell while he buys him some time. As magic can still hurt Superboy-Prime, both Shazam and Black Adam quote \\"Shazam\\" which knocks out Superboy-Prime. It was mentioned that Superboy-Prime was handed over to the Justice League as the Shazam Family didn't know what else to do with him.Shazam (vol. 3) #14 (September 2020). DC Comics. In the pages of \\"Dark Nights: Death Metal,\\" Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman travel back to the times of the three great crises to stop Perpetua's attempts to manipulate those events. Wonder Woman encounters a victorious Superboy-Prime. He taunts Wonder Woman that Perpetua has already changed the outcome of these events.Dark Nights: Death Metal: Trinity Crisis #1. DC Comics. Although the Anti-Monitor and Darkseid nearly unmake Batman and Superman in the other Crises, Wonder Woman is able to talk with Prime about his resentment of the heroes for becoming darker than he remembers from his childhood, imploring him to accept that change is constant, and that in the end there‚Äôs room for all universes. Superboy Prime shatters the Crisis worlds (saving Batman and Superman in the process), and directs all energy to Wally West, but his change proves apparently pointless as the Darkest Knight had already rigged the Mobius Chair so it would always direct the power to himself, allowing him to remake the Multiverse in his own imageDark Knights: Death Metal #4. Powers and abilities=Kryptonian powers Superboy-Prime has all the basic abilities of a Kryptonian except at a much higher level when compared to most adult Kryptonians, especially Superman, with exposure to yellow sunlight: superhuman strength, speed, senses, healing, endurance, superbreath, flight, X-ray vision, telescopic vision, microscopic vision, heat vision, and invulnerability. Power suit While imprisoned by the Flashes in the speed force (where the flash draws his power from), Superboy-Prime builds a power suit based on the one worn by the Anti-Monitor. The suit collects and feeds him yellow solar energy to maintain his power levels even when exposed to a red sun; in his first appearance, he was shown to shrug off the effects of artificial, localized red sun radiation, but he was not exposed to an actual red sun. Although he claims to have made it himself, Bart Allen remembers him stealing it following his escape. It is destroyed when the two Supermen fly Superboy-Prime through Krypton's red sun. After his escape from Oa, Superboy- Prime is given a new power suit built by the Sinestro Corps and reveals that he created the original after seeing how the Anti-Monitor's armor acted as a giant energy collector. It was destroyed during the assault on Earth. In Legion of 3 Worlds, Superboy-Prime dons his original armor once more, taking it from a statue in the Superman museum. During the Blackest Night, the Black Lantern Alexander Luthor provides Superboy-Prime with a copy of his original armor. It was ripped off by the aforementioned Black Lanterns. Weaknesses Whereas most versions of Superman have a weakness to magic, Superboy-Prime has a greater resistance to it; he was able to easily fight off Black Adam during their initial encounter, and was only defeated by Shazam and Black Adam in the New 52 when both of them attacked him by saying their word simultaneously, striking him with far more magical force than even he could cope with. Additionally, most versions are affected by Kryptonite; however, kryptonite from one universe does not affect Kryptonians from other universes. The Krypton of Earth Prime's universe--unlike other versions of the planet-- was completely absorbed by its sun, rather than being destroyed and fragments ejected from the explosion which would have created kryptonite, so for some time it seemed that no kryptonite that could affect Superboy-Prime existed. During his battles with the three Legions, however, the \\"Threeboot\\" Element Lad is able to transmute the ground around Superboy-Prime into a form of kryptonite that does hurt him. It is revealed that threeboot Element Lad is from Earth-Prime's future. Superboy-Prime loses his powers when exposed to a red sun, as do other versions of Superman. In his first appearance, he is shown to resist the effects of red sun radiation; however, this radiation was artificial. Every time Prime has been depowered it has taken an actual red sun, and not merely localized red sun radiation. Kal-El and Kal-L defeat Superboy-Prime by flying him directly through Krypton's red sun Rao, destroying his armor and diminishing their powers in the process. Afterward, the Green Lantern Corps imprison him inside a \\"junior\\" Red Sun-Eater, which similarly depowers him. Also, unlike most versions of Superman who can store yellow solar energy to extend the use of their powers, Prime requires constant exposure to yellow sunlight to maintain his, otherwise he will depower almost instantly. His reaction to psionics has not been fully explored, although Martian Manhunter is shown to be able to read his mind. Saturn Girl's attempts to attack him psionically seem to have little effect. When Nightshade attacks Superboy-Prime with darkness, he shows a deep achluophobia brought about most likely from the darkness blocking his access to yellow sunlight. Superboy- Prime has a fear of the Flash Family, due in large part to them pushing Superboy-Prime into the Speed Force, where they imprison him under red sunlight to depower him for several years until he breaks out. He reveals his continued fear of them, when during the Sinestro Corps War, he is confronted by Wally West and Jay Garrick, whom he admits with a stutter \\"I d-don't like Speedsters!\\" This fear is again on display in Legion of 3 Worlds, when he lapses into a fearful stutter while recounting his battle with the Flashes during Infinite Crisis. Upon learning of the Legion's attempts to bring Bart back, Prime goes into a panic, going so far as to fly through his own Legion's forces as to attempt to stop Bart from returning; yelling and stuttering, even whimpering to himself in fear as he does so. Upon realizing that he is too late, Prime even screams in fear upon seeing the returned Kid Flash racing towards him. Massive amounts of quantum energy have been shown to injure Superboy-Prime as well, as seen in his battle with Monarch. Personality According to Infinite Crisis writer Geoff Johns, \\"Superboy-Prime's really frustrated with what his life has turned into and, unfortunately, that frustration is going to be taken out on the world\\". He also mentioned that \\"He's been wanting to show the world what he can do, because he barely had a chance to be Superboy. He was Superboy a little bit before Crisis on Infinite Earths and then--BOOM!--his world was wiped out and that was it\\".Wizard: The Guide to Comics #172 (2005) After the publication of Infinite Crisis #5, Johns said at the Wizard World LA convention: \\"That took me a long time to break, because I thought Superboy-Prime needed to view the world so narrow. You can see how his world view is so narrow and so black and white and realistically that is not going to work anymore\\". Originally, Superboy-Prime started out coming into Crisis as corrupted and evil, but the take on the character did not work for Johns. \\"I said to Dan I think Prime does it by accident and is horrified. That panel where's he is looking at his hands and goes 'I didn't mean to do it', that for me is the entire story for Superboy-Prime. He didn't mean to do this stuff. What is worse... making a mistake and fessing up to it or doing something bad and saying 'You made me do it?'. Superboy-Prime is a very simplistic character who has become very complex\\".WWLA Day One: Out of Crisis a Nation is Born In The DCU Nation Tour, Comic Book Resources, March 17, 2006 When asked if Superboy-Prime was irredeemable or not, Johns replied \\"I think it's a split. You saw his reaction when he did what he did in Infinite Crisis, but at that same time, he's walked over that line. Does he think he can walk back? Should he? Does this universe even matter to him anymore? Is it the fact that now that he's got a big dent on his car, another one won't matter? If he's already on that path, is he going to continue on it, or is he going to really try and work and go back?\\"Geoff Johns - Green Lantern, OA, Prime & More , Newsarama, September 5, 2006 Alternate versions In Dark Multiverse: Infinite Crisis, after Ted Kord takes over Checkmate when he kills Maxwell Lord, he manages to subvert most of Alexander Luthor's plans before confronting Luthor and Prime directly. After Alexander Luthor confirms Ted's belief that he has been manipulating events and denounces Prime as an idiot he manipulated into helping him, Luthor kills the Earth-2 Superman and Lois when he tries to kill Prime with a specially designed kryptonite weapon, only for Prime to kill him. Kord convinces Prime to act as his enforcer as he tries to establish himself as Earth's new discreet 'ruler', using Brother Eye's insight to track and eliminate metahuman threats, but when Prime defies his orders to bring in the Teen Titans unharmed, Kord infects Prime with the OMAC nanites to turn him into part of Kord's new OMAC enforcers.

While Dugit was under the municipal authority of the Hof Aza Regional Council it was not physically in the Gush Katif bloc where the bulk of the Gush Katif settlements were located. History The non-religious village was founded in May 1990 by a group of three families of fishermen close to the Shikma Beach with the assistance of the Amana settlement organization. These families, and others that joined later on, lived in trailers for about ten years until permanent homes were built. Another building expansion project was already in advanced planning stages. Economy The main source of income was from the sea: fishing, rescue services, fish ponds, tourism, fish restaurants, etc. Unilateral Disengagement Unlike virtually all the other settlements slated for destruction as part of the disengagement plan, whose inhabitants were forcibly evicted by the Israeli Army and Israeli Police, the families of Dugit chose to co-operate with the eviction orders and most had already packed and abandoned their homes before the official date. Rebuilding attempts Avi Farhan from Elei Sinai and a part of his family established a new group including families from Dugit and Nisanit with hope to establish a new community. The government agreed in 2006 to acclimatize this group in Palmachim. The plan was then changed to resettle in the Givat Olga beach neighbourhood of Hadera. As of 2009, Neve Yam is attempting a rejuvenation project by attracting these families by allotting them land adjacent to the sea for permanent housing. The new project would give the evictees a housing and employment solution similar to that of their original homes. The Israel Union for Environmental Defense is struggling to prevent the project it deems is too close to the beach.

It has been created in 1959 as one of Brazil's first national parks, to protect the Itaimbezinho canyon. It extends over an area of 10,250 hectares. Flora and fauna Despite its relatively small size, the park is characterised by a rich biodiversity, as result of its diverse relief and of being situated at the contact between coastal forests, grasslands and Araucaria moist forests. There have been at least 143 bird, 48 mammal, and 39 amphibian species documented in the park. Endangered fauna on the plateaus of the park include the red- spectacled amazon parrot, the maned wolf, and the cougar. On the slopes, the neotropical otter, ocelot and the brown howling monkey can be found. Conservation and threats When created in 1959, the national park protected an area of 13,000 ha. This has been reduced to 10,250 ha in 1972 through a presidential decree. In 1992 adjoining the national park, the new Serra Geral National Park has been created, encompassing an additional 17,300 ha. However, according to the Duke University's Center for Tropical Conservation, the current park area, even after the extension with Serra Geral National Park, is still too small to be effective for the protection of representative samples of each distinct environment. One of the main obstacles for conservation efforts is that the state only has title over 67.5% of the land, and even part of that is occupied by farmers. Raising cattle, the practice of using fire to \\"renew\\" grasslands, the establishment of banana plantations with associated use of pesticides and the presence of domestic animals, all contribute to environmental degradation. Other threats are posed by invasive flora from the areas surrounding the park and poaching. Currently a maximum of 1,500 visitors per day are allowed in the park.

It lies on the edge of the Vale of Belvoir and just off the A607, south-west from Grantham and north-east from Melton Mowbray. History Harlaxton village sign Coneygree and gazebo SS Mary and Peter's Church, Harlaxton Narrowboat mooring at Harlaxton Wharf The village is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as \\"Herlavestune\\". The name derives from the Old English Herelaf+tun, meaning \\"estate or farm of Herelaf\\".A. D. Mills, \\"A Dictionary of English Place-Names,\\" Oxford University Press, 1991. In 1740 a burial urn was uncovered in the village containing Roman coins. The history of Harlaxton village is tied to that of Harlaxton Manor. The original manor house dated from the 14th century and stood south of the church off Rectory Lane where the original moat can still be seen in gardens there. It is recorded as having been used as a hunting lodge by John of Gaunt. It was purchased and occupied by the De Ligne family around 1475 eventually standing empty from 1780 until 1857 when it was pulled down. By this time the present Harlaxton Manor had been built some distance to the East of the village.Girouard, Mark, \\"Harlaxton Manor\\" , Harlaxton Manor Guidebook, 1984. The life of the village was tied to that of the Lords of the Manor and the Estate, with many villagers employed by, and their houses and cottages tied to, the estate. This remained the case until 1937 when the estate was broken up. Many villagers had already found employment elsewhere by the time of the First World War, when transport improvements made this an option. Most of the older houses in the village were built by the De Ligne and Gregory families. The Nottingham to Grantham canal passes to the north of the village and was a source of commerce for the village in the early 19th century. During the First World War a Royal Flying Corps aerodrome was constructed at the rear of the manor house. The airfield stood vacant between the wars but became RAF Harlaxton between 1942 and 1957, latterly operating as a relief landing ground for flying training units from RAF Cranwell. Following the Second World War the village grew in size and population with small developments either side of the main Grantham to Melton Mowbray road. Although there was already the Golden Lion public house in the centre of the village, in the latter part of the 19th century the Gregory Arms was built by the Squire John Sherwin Gregory on what is now the A607 junction. Community According to a 2004 village design statement to the South Kesteven District Council in response to redevelopment plans, residents were opposed to further housing development that could \\"alter the unique character of this conservation village\\". Harlaxton has a mixture of retired residents and young families, and is socially cohesive. Although close to amenities in Grantham, the statement also notes the village's post office, store, surgery, school, village hall and clubs, and that it is set in woodland, is surrounded by farmland, has habitat for wildlife and views of Belvoir Castle. In July 2010 the villagers joined supporters of the Grantham Canal Society in the reopening of the newly restored Harlaxton Wharf. The Grantham Canal Partnership has applied for Lottery Funding to restore two derelict locks as part of an Inland Waterway‚Äôs Association skill training scheme. The village now has a population of just over 700.http://www.research- lincs.org.uk/lro/documents_lro/Site_Text/2001_Census/Parish_Profiles/PDF/32UG040.pdf There is a post office, church, primary school, doctor‚Äôs surgery, village store and village hall. There is also a sports and social club and a bowls club. Landmarks Harlaxton church is dedicated to St Mary and St Peter and is a Grade I listed building. It is of ironstone and limestone ashlar in Perpendicular style, with parts dating from the 12th century. The church has an early 14th-century buttressed tower and a font dating from around 1400. The south porch was re-built in 1856. John Oldrid Scott restored the interior in 1890-91. There is an alabaster memorial monument from c.1400, and further monuments to the De Ligne and Gregory families of the manor of Harlaxton. After 1857 many of the buildings utilised building materials from the demolished manor house. Between 1758 and 1822 George De Ligne was responsible for the building and repair of much of the village including the rows of cottages on The Drift near the Nottingham to Grantham canal; his initials can be seen on the cottages. Originally wattle and daub, they were refinished by De Ligne in red brick as are many of the buildings in the village, with added embellishments of stonework. Thirty-six buildings in the village are Grade II listed. There are unusual architectural features in the older buildings including distinctive chimneys, rounded pillars and overstated porches and verandas. There are statues in gardens, listed gazebos, a duck pond, and substantial dry stone walls. Near the village store is a pillar on a double base known as the obelisk which could be the remains of a market cross. Piped water was not introduced until the 1940s and some of the wells previously used survive. One of the gateways to the original manor house still stands on Rectory Lane.

He litigated several major civil rights cases in Alabama, including some that reached the United States Supreme Court for rulings. He served as the President of the National Bar Association in 1985, and in 2001 was elected as the first African-American President of the Alabama State Bar. Early life Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Gray attended the Loveless School, where his aunt taught, until the seventh grade. He attended the Nashville Christian Institute (NCI), a boarding school operated by the Churches of Christ, where he assisted NCI president and noted preacher Marshall Keeble in visiting other churches of the racially diverse nondenominational fellowship. After graduation, Gray matriculated at Alabama State College for Negroes, and received a baccalaureate degree in 1951. Encouraged by a teacher to apply to law school despite his earlier plans to become a historian and preacher, Gray moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and received a juris doctor degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in 1954. At the time there was no law school in Alabama that would accept African Americans. After passing the bar examination, Gray returned to his home town and established a law office. He also began preaching at the Holt Street Church of Christ, where his parents had long been devout members.\\"Fred David Gray\\", Stanford Encyclopedia Career as a preacher In 1957, Gray fulfilled his mother's dream by becoming a preacher in Churches of Christ. In 1974, he helped merge white and black congregations in Tuskegee, Alabama, where he had moved. Gray also served on the board of trustees for Southwestern Christian College, a historically black college near Dallas, Texas affiliated with the Churches of Christ. In 2012 Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, also affiliated with the Churches of Christ bestowed a doctorate of humane letters honoris causa upon Gray in 2012. Gray once challenged Lipscomb's segregation practices. Civil Rights Movement During the Civil Rights Movement, Gray came to prominence working with Martin Luther King, Jr. and E.D. Nixon, among others. In some of his first cases as a young Alabama attorney (and solo practitioner), Gray defended Claudette Colvin and later Rosa Parks, who were charged with disorderly conduct for refusing to seat themselves in the rear of segregated city buses. After Alabama Attorney General John Malcolm Patterson effectively prohibited the NAACP from operating in Alabama in 1956, Gray provided legal counsel for eight years (including three trips through the state court system and two through federal courts) until the organization was permitted to operate in the state. He also successfully defended Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from charges of tax evasion in 1960, winning an acquittal from an all-white jury. Other notable civil rights cases brought and argued by Gray included Dixon v. Alabama (1961, which established due process rights for students at public universities), Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1962, which overturned state redistricting of Tuskegee that excluded most of the majority- black residents; this contributed to laying a foundation for \\"one man, one vote\\") and Williams v. Wallace (1963, which protected the Selma to Montgomery marchers). In another Supreme Court case, Gray was driven in his efforts to have the NAACP organize in Alabama after the group was forbidden in the state. Alabama resisted integration of public schools following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that ruled segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Gray successfully represented Vivian Malone and James Hood, who had been denied admission to the University of Alabama, and they entered the university despite Governor George Wallace's Stand in the Schoolhouse Door incident. In 1963 Gray successfully sued Florence State University (now University of North Alabama) on behalf of Wendell Wilkie Gunn, who had been denied admission based on race. Gray also led the successful effort to desegregate Auburn University. In 1963 Gray filed the Lee v. Macon County Board of Education case, which in 1967 led a three- judge panel of U.S. District Judges to order all Alabama public schools not already subject to court orders to desegregate. Lawsuits filed by Gray helped desegregate more than 100 local school systems, as well as all public colleges and universities in his home state. In 1970, Gray, along with Thomas J. Reed, became the first African Americans elected as legislators in Alabama since Reconstruction. Gray's district included Tuskegee and parts of Barbour, Bullock, and Macon counties. Fred Gray at an exhibition opening about Rosa Parks at the Library of Congress with Terri Sewell in 2019. Gray's autobiography, Bus Ride to Justice, was published in 1994, and a revised edition in 2012. Browder v. Gayle Case The Browder v. Gayle case was a case heard before a three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on Montgomery and Alabama state bus segregation laws. The panel consisted of Middle District of Alabama Judge Frank Minis Johnson, Northern District of Alabama Judge Seybourn Harris Lynne, and the fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Rives. On June 5, 1956, the District Court Ruled 2-1, with Lynne dissenting, that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to the U.S. Constitution Later on the state and city would appeal the decision, which later went to the Supreme Court on November 13, 1956. A motion of clarification and the rehearing of the case would be later declined on December 17, 1956. Shortly after the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in December 1955, many black community leaders were discussing if they would file a federal lawsuit to try and challenge the City of Montgomery and Alabama about the bus segregation laws. About two months after the bus boycott began, civil rights activists reconsidered the case of Claudette Colvin. She was a 15-year-old who had been the first person arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, nine months prior to Rosa Parks's actions. Fred Gray, E. D. Nixon, president of the NAACP and secretary of the new Montgomery Improvement Association: and Clifford Durr (a white lawyer who, with his wife, Virginia Foster Durr was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement) searched for the ideal case law to challenge the constitutional legitimacy of the Montgomery and Alabama bus segregation laws. Gray later did research for the lawsuit and consulted with NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorneys Robert L. Carter and Thurgood Marshall (who would late become United States Solicitor General and the first African-American United States Supreme Court Justice). Gray later approached Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, Mary Louise Smith (activist), and Jeanetta Reese, all women who had been discriminated against by the drivers enforcing segregation policy in the Montgomery bus system. They all agreed to become plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit (except Jeanetta Reese due to intimidation by the members of the white community), thus by passing the Alabama court system. Jeanetta Reese later falsely claimed she did not agree to the lawsuit which made the lawsuit an unsuccessful attempt to disbar Gray for supposedly improperly representing her. Tuskegee experiment lawsuit Gray also represented plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit about the controversial federal Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972). During the Great Depression, the study was changed to review untreated syphilis in rural African-American male subjects, who thought they were receiving free health care and funeral benefits. Gray filed the case, Pollard v. U.S. Public Health Service, in 1972, after a whistleblower reported the abuses to the Washington Star and The New York Times, which investigated further and published stories. In 1975, Gray achieved a successful settlement for $10 million and medical treatment for those 72 subjects still living of the original 399. (Penicillin had become a standard treatment by 1947, although research subjects were specifically denied that treatment as well as their true diagnosis.) The 40 subsequently infected spouses and 19 congenitally infected children were compensated with medical, health and burial benefits managed by the USPHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) several years later. As a result of the lawsuit and settlement, the 1979 Belmont Report was prepared and Congress passed federal laws. These were implemented by establishing Institutional Review Boards for the protection of human research subjects and the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) in the Department of Health and Human Services. In 1997 Gray founded (and subsequently served as president and board member of) the Tuskegee History Center. This nonprofit corporation operates a museum and offers educational resources concerning the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, as well as contributions made by various ethnic groups in the fields of human and civil rights. Judicial nomination On January 10, 1980, President Carter nominated Gray to be a judge on the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, to fill a vacancy created by Judge Frank Minis Johnson's elevation to what then was the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Gray later asked his nomination be withdrawn, as happened on September 17, 1980; President Carter instead nominated Myron Herbert Thompson to that seat. Personal life Gray married the former Bernice Hill, his secretary, in 1955, and they had four children. He published his autobiography the same year, Bus Ride to Justice: The Life and Works of Fred GrayFred Gray Biography, Life, Interesting Facts. He is also a member of Omega Psi Phi and Sigma Pi Phi. Awards In 1980, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference awarded Gray its Drum Major Award. In 1996, the American Bar Association awarded Gray its Spirit of Excellence Award (having awarded him its Equal Justice Award in 1977). The National Bar Association awarded him its C. Frances Stradford Award. In 2002, Gray became the first African-American president of the Alabama Bar Association. In 2006, the NAACP recognized Gray's accomplishments with the William Robert Ming Advocacy Award, citing the spirit of financial and personal sacrifice displayed in his legal work. In 1980 Fred Gray received the Drum Major Award of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He also won the Spirit of Excellence Award from the American Bar Association (1996). In popular culture Gray is portrayed by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in the 2014 film Selma, which dramatizes the Selma to Montgomery marches and Gray's argument before Judge Frank Johnson that the march should be allowed to go forward. Shawn Michael Howard portrays Gray in the 2001 film Boycott, in which Gray, himself, plays a cameo role as a supporter of Martin Luther King Jr.. Gray was depicted in the 2016 stage play The Integration of Tuskegee High School. The production premiered at Auburn University, was written and directed by Tessa Carr, and dramatizes Gray's involvement in the case of Lee v. Macon County Board of Education.

The film was produced by Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman for Tempean Films, from a screenplay by Jimmy Sangster. Many horror fans thought the feature was a Hammer Films production when it came out, due to its similar look and Sangster's writer's credit. The film's U.S. release was in October 1958 as a double feature with Universal's Monster on the Campus. The film's storyline, set in Transylvania, is about a scientist who uses the inmates of a prison for the criminally insane as sources for his gruesome blood-typing and -transfusion experiments that are keeping him alive. Plot A man's body wrapped in a shroud is shoved into a Transylvania grave in 1874. An executioner (Milton Reid) drives a stake through its heart. Immediately afterward, Carl (Victor Maddern), who is severely physically disabled, emerges from hiding and kills the gravedigger (Otto Diamant). Carl summons a drunken doctor (Cameron Hall) to perform a heart transplant on the body, then murders the doctor. Six years later, Dr. John Pierre (Vincent Ball) is convicted of \\"malpractice leading to manslaughter\\" after an emergency blood transfusion, which has never been done successfully, fails, killing his patient. As John's fianc√©e Madeleine (Barbara Shelley) watches, John is sentenced to life imprisonment in a penal colony. But instead he's sent to a Prison for the Criminal Insane, run by Dr. Callistratus (Donald Wolfit). When John meets Callistratus, he learns that he is to help with Calistratus's blood-typing research, so that transfusions can be safely done, especially for those with an unnamed \\"rare and serious blood condition\\". At his trial, John maintained that the patient's death was unavoidable and asked the judge (John Le Mesurier) to write to Prof. Meinster (Henry Vidon) in Geneva to vouch for him. The judge says that he already had, but Meinster replied that he doesn't know John. At the request of Madeleine and her uncle (John Stuart), Meinster travels to Transylvania, where they meet with Auron (Bryan Coleman), a member of the Prison Commission. Meinster insists that he was never contacted by the court. Auron, who is on Callistratus's payroll, had intercepted the letter to Meinster and forged a reply. He now must reopen the case. John grows increasingly uncomfortable with his work because the blood is from unwilling inmates, many of whom die. Auron visits Callistratus and tells him that the Prison Commission has ordered John's release. Callistratus, however, tells John that the Commission has denied his appeal and tells the Commission that John and another inmate, Kurt (William Devlin), both died in an escape attempt. John and Kurt then actually try to escape, but fail. Kurt is presumably killed by the vicious Dobermans which keep the prisoners in line. Madeleine refuses to believe that John is dead and takes a job as Callistratus' housekeeper so she can investigate. John discovers that Kurt's grave is empty. Auron visits Callistratus again and recognises Madeleine from their meeting. Auron goes to her room and attempts to rape her, but is stopped by Carl, who has fallen in love with her. Callistratus demands an explanation of the assault. Madeleine tells him what happened. Auron denies it and tells Callistratus about her relationship with John. Callistratus throws him out. Insulted, Auron threatens to expose Callistratus. After he leaves, Callistratus sends Carl after him and Auron is not seen again. Callistratus takes Madeleine to his laboratory and chains her to a wall. John arrives to rescue her but is also chained. Callistratus orders Carl to strap Madeleine to an operating table, but Carl refuses. Callistratus shoots him. Callistratus straps her down himself and wheels out Kurt, now just a torso with a head and one arm. Callistratus tells John that because of his earlier work with blood, he was executed for being a vampire, but had put himself into a state of suspended animation. The heart transplant revived him, but he now has the \\"rare and fatal blood condition\\" he spoke of earlier. He needs constant transfusions and has drained all the blood of many inmates. He now intends to transfuse Madeleine's blood into Kurt. John yells to Kurt to \\"resist\\" and Kurt grips Callistratus' arm. As they struggle, they move close enough for John to knock Callistratus unconscious and free himself. Kurt dies from the exertion. John unstraps Madeleine and takes Callistratus hostage, demanding free passage from the prison. They walk free but Carl, who survived Callistratus' shot, frees the hounds, then dies after being shot again by the guards. The Dobermans tear Callistratus to shreds.

Production The film was inspired by the success of Hammer's The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and The Horror of Dracula (1958). The producers hired Jimmy Sangster, writer of both those movies, to do the screenplay. Shooting took four weeks.John Hamilton, The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70 Hemlock Books 2013 p 52-56 Blood of the Vampire was distributed in the UK by Eros Films and in the USA by Universal International. Posters for Blood of the Vampire indicate that it was considered an adults-only film in France and the UK at the time of its release. French posters note that viewing by people under age 16 was prohibited and UK posters show that the film carried an X Certificate from the British Board of Film Censors, which prohibited the exhibition of the movie to those under 16. The X Certificate is indicative of the activities of Eros Film Distributors, which had by then deliberately 'embarked on a new X-certificate path'. Tempean Productions 'embraced' not only films designed to get an X cert, but also 'Eros's policy of offering co- feature programmes which could be marketed not only in Britain, but also on the American drive-in circuits'. Producing films for drive-in theatres was apparently successful. According to a contemporary newspaper advertisement, the Moonlite Drive-In in Smithtown, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, 3 August 1960 ran a dawn-to-dusk triple feature with Blood of the Vampire as the first movie - nearly two years after its American release - Revenge of Frankenstein (1958) the second and The Beast of Hollow Mountain (1956) the third. As a promotion, attendees whose tickets ended in 13 or 31 were treated to 'Dracula's Buffet Luncheon', which consisted of 'Dracula's Cocktail, Deviled Zombie Skulls, Crispy Skull Chips, Devil Fruit, Voodoo Spirits' and a 'Werewolf Tall Sandwich'. Blood of the Vampire was released over a considerable amount of time in a number of countries. After its London premiere on 26 August 1958, it opened in the USA in October 1958 and was followed by Germany in December 1958, the Netherlands in April 1959, France in April 1960, Japan in July 1960, Spain in 1966 and Sweden in October 1969. The film also played in theatres in Belgium, Italy, Greece and Brazil. It was re-released theatrically in France in 1986, as well. The running time of the film was 84 minutes in the UK and 87 minutes in the USA. Curiously, the model village scene for Carlstadt at about 10 minutes into the film uses the same model set (with the Globe theatre) as used for the 1944 film Henry V. Reception Initial reviews of Blood of the Vampire were mixed. Review Digest in the January 19, 1959 issue of BoxOffice magazine showed the following ratings: Harrison's Report and Film Daily called the film \\"very good\\"; BoxOffice, The Hollywood Reporter, and Parents' Magazine rated it as \\"good\\"; and Variety called it \\"fair\\". The New York Daily News, always a part of \\"Review Digest\\", did not review the film. In summarizing contemporary reviews, film critic Bill Warren writes that \\"although the film was popular and still has its adherents, Blood of the Vampire was not greeted by much enthusiasm by film critics, although most thought it somewhat above average\\". For example, Charles Stinson of The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"it is gratifying to be able to turn in an on-the-whole good report on the film. It is \\"intelligently scripted and well acted by a group of British performers\\". Jack Moffitt of The Hollywood Reporter, whom Warren calls \\"hard-to-please\\", wrote in his review that the film \\"rates more serious audience attention than most of the contemporary rash of domestic horror films. Direction by Henry Cass is brisk enough to keep yawning from being contagious to the audience\\". Reviews from the U.K. were mixed. According to film critic John Hamilton, Film Daily described the film as \\"one of the best films in the horror-fiction category. It ventures into gore and supernatural with a headlong grandeur\\", while The Monthly Film Bulletin took a dimmer view, calling it \\"an essay in hokum\\" and stating that the producers incorporated \\"every trick of the macabre and the horrific they can legitimately introduce\\". In a more modern view of the film, historian Paul Adams points out that 'Blood of the Vampire is a vampire film in name only as ... the undead creature of the title is in fact a human scientist, rather than a true nosferatu, resurrected from beyond the grave by an impromptu heart transplant and subsequently kept alive by frequent and gory Eastman Color blood transfusions courtesy of the inmates of a local insane asylum\\". Author Paul Meehan calls the film \\"packed with the blood, gore and sadism of Jimmy Sangster's script\\" and notes that \\"grafting an element of science fiction onto the traditional notion of vampirism\\" doesn't work all that well. \\"The film's pseudoscience, such as do-it-yourself 19th century heart-transplant surgery and suspended animation, strains credulity while reaching for a scientific rationale for vampire resurrection\\". In Warren's view, \\"It's a shade better than some of its class, but the lumpy direction, muddled plot, and slow pace make it look much worse now than it did when it was new ... This is horror by the book, circa 1958, and it's pretty drab ... Cass' direction is, at best, pedestrian, but he probably had little time to do anything\\". Taking the opposite view, Meehan says, \\"Director Henry Cass moves the plot along vigorously while providing effective gothic atmosphere\\". British critic Phil Hardy seems to agree, calling it a \\"superior British horror movie\\" and \\"probably the routine Cass's best movie\\". Warren finds some virtue in the film, though, calling the art direction by John Elphink \\"imaginative\\" and noting that \\"several sets seem positively cavernous\\", probably because of lens choice by cinematographer Geoffrey Seaholme. But overall the end result is disappointing because Wolfit \\"is made up to resemble Bela Lugosi, which he otherwise does not\\" and because \\"characters pop up, deliver their lines, and are quickly disposed of\\". In the end, he writes, \\"Blood of the Vampire is notable today for its bogus qualities: it is a fake Hammer film, about a scientific vampire, with an imitation Bela Lugosi\\". Television Clips from Blood of the Vampire are featured in two episodes of the TV series 100 Years of Horror: in episode No. 2, \\"Blood-Drinking Creatures\\", which originally aired on December 19, 1996, and in episode No. 15, \\"Scream Queens\\", first shown April 17, 1997. Film posters or clips were shown in the made-for-television film Hollywood's Creepiest Creatures, hosted by Elvira, and airing on Halloween Night 2004.  Home video  Blood of the Vampire has been available for home viewing for decades in the U.S. It was first released in 1978 on VHS and Betamax by Magnetic Video. Gorgon Films later released the film on VHS in 1993. A 2006 DVD release followed from Dark Sky Films. Theatrical trailers from the film were used in the 1996 VHS release, Nightmare Theater's Late Night Chill-o-rama Horror Show Vol.1. Finding the film in the U.K. seems to have been more difficult. Hardy wrote in 1986 that \\"all prints of it appear to have been destroyed\\". The first mention of it being available in the U.K. for home viewing is its 2007 DVD release by Simply Media.

History Weavertown shares a history with the churches known as Old Order Amish, and its origin is rooted in issues very important to the Old Order Amish church community of the 1890s. The fundamental issue behind the church division which led to the formation of the Weavertown church was disagreement with the Amish practice of Streng Meidung, the shunning or social avoidance of individuals who had left Amish church fellowship to join other churches. This Streng Meidung was an important issue long before more obvious secondary issues like acceptance or non-acceptance of automobiles, electricity, tractors, central heating, or telephones became significant distinguishing characteristics. On shunning, some Amish felt that it was wrong to pronounce strong social excommunication for what amounted to changes of church membership. Others maintained that church membership was a lifelong commitment, and that the Streng Meidung was a reasonable response toward one forsaking that commitment. In 1910, a group of Old Order Amish church members (about 85 people in 35 families, representing about one-fifth of Old Order Amish membership in Lancaster County at that time) who strongly disagreed with the practice of Streng Meidung commenced meeting as a group somewhat distinct from the rest of the Old Order Amish; this group eventually became the Weavertown Amish Mennonite Church. The first church services of the group had been held on September 29, 1909, though no ordained ministers were present. The break with the Old Order Amish began on February 27, 1910, when bishops from outside the community were invited to ordain ministers for the new church. This may have occurred at the home of George W. Beiler, near the village of Gordonville, Pennsylvania. Worship services were conducted on alternating Sundays in homes of members, as the Old Order Amish still do today. However, in the fall of 1909, the first meetings were held every three or four weeks. The church group was at first called the Peachey Church (sometimes the Peachey Old Order Church) after an influential preacher and organizer, Samuel W. Peachey, and later the Crist King Church (sometimes the Crist King Old Order Church) after an early bishop, Christian L. King. Christian King separated from the church in 1925, whereupon the church was called the John A. Stoltzfus Church after its new bishop. At this time, church members were very similar to the Old Order Amish in appearance and practice; there was little difference between the two until the new group gradually began to accept the use of telephone and electricity. Use of automobiles was first permitted in 1928. A meeting house, originally built by the Old German Baptist Brethren in 1888, and later part of the Church of the Brethren, was acquired around 1930. The location of the meeting house contributed a permanent name to the congregation: though the building had been named the Bird-in-Hand Church House, it was located nearer the village of Weavertown: from that time, both the building and the people came to be known as the Weavertown Amish Mennonite Church. Distinctives Weavertown church members still dress somewhat plainly and distinctively. Women wear the prayer covering, married men grow beards, and members do not make use of broadcast television or radio in their homes or cars. Acceptance of electricity, telephone, central heating, field tractors, and automobiles, however, marks them as quite distinct from the Old Order Amish. In matters of belief, however, except for the difference about the practice of Streng Meidung or shunning, they are quite alike. Amish churches are generally not evangelistic, nor do they generally embrace doctrines like the assurance of salvation, and on these points they are also different from the Weavertown congregation. Church services at the Weavertown Amish Mennonite Church had been conducted exclusively in High German and Pennsylvania Dutch until 1966; since then services have been conducted in English. Congregational singing has always been unaccompanied by musical instruments. Youth generally attend high school and occasionally college. Youth from the Weavertown church have served terms of voluntary service in Germany, South America, Central America, northern Canada, and various areas of the United States, and generally tour for a week each summer as a choral group. Beachy Amish The term Beachy Amish was first used after a similar Amish church division occurred in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, in 1927. In that case, the church opposed to the Streng Meidung came to be called Beachy after their bishop, Moses M. Beachy. In 1950, the Weavertown church was welcomed into full fellowship with the Somerset County and other Beachy congregations. Churches in that group are frequently called Beachy Amish, though in Lancaster County, the term Amish Mennonite is still more common. They have similarities to the Conservative Mennonites. As of 1996, there were 92 Beachy Amish congregations in the U.S., eight in Canada, one in Costa Rica, two in El Salvador, four in Belize, two in Paraguay, and one in Ireland. Missionary work continues in all the countries named, and also in Kenya and Uganda. 7,238 baptized members were counted as of 1990. Particulars of dress, acceptance of technology, and use of German vary greatly from congregation to congregation. All congregations honor the Schleitheim Confession of 1527 and the Dordrecht Confession of Faith of 1632 as summaries of Christian doctrine and practice. Today Because of growth of the Weavertown congregation, three daughter congregations have been established over the years: two in Lancaster County -- Pequea (pronounced \\"peck way\\") Amish Mennonite Church in 1962, and Mine Road Amish Mennonite Church in 1969; another daughter congregation was established in Washington County, Pennsylvania in 2000. Other Amish Mennonite churches in Lancaster county include Gap View Amish Mennonite Church, Summitview Christian Fellowship, and Westhaven Amish Mennonite Church. Membership of the Weavertown congregation in 1990 was about 110 households, with 220 baptized members. Weavertown Mennonite School is across the street from the church. Sunday church services include Sunday School at 9:00 AM and a worship service starts at 10:15 AM. The church has a strong tradition of hospitality and welcomes visitors.

It was made by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, directed by Clarence Brown, and produced by Clarence Brown and Sidney Franklin. The screenplay was by Claudine West, and George Froeschel, with the credit for additional poetry by Robert Nathan. Nathan stated in an interview that he wrote the screenplay as his first work as a contracted writer for MGM but the studio credited Claudine West who died in 1943 as a tribute to her.\\"Robert Nathan interview\\" in Davis, Ronald L. Words into Images: Screenwriters on the Studio System Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2007. p.42 Plot At the height of World War II, American-born Lady Susan Ashwood (Irene Dunne) is a nurse in a British hospital, awaiting the arrival of some wounded men. Via flashback, she thinks back to how she came to Britain many years before. In 1914, Susan and her father, small-town Rhode Island newspaper publisher Hiram P. Dunn (Frank Morgan), come to Britain, intending to stay for two weeks. Old Colonel Forsythe (C. Aubrey Smith) introduces Susan to Sir John Ashwood (Alan Marshal), a baronet and one of the landed gentry, with an estate and manor house. They fall in love, and despite some friction over her being American, they marry. Their honeymoon is cut short when World War I breaks out. John is also an army officer; he rejoins his regiment and goes to war in France. Susan and John's mother, Lady Jean (Gladys Cooper), wait for news, good or bad. John's brother Reggie (John Warburton) is killed in action. John finally gets a chance to be with Susan for a few days in France, which they spend in Dieppe. During their stay, the United States declares war on Germany. Lady Susan returns to Britain and has a son, also named John. She, baby John, and Colonel Forsythe watch as newly arrived American troops parade through London. John is killed near the end of the fighting, never having seen his wife again or his son. Susan and young John (Roddy McDowall) live in the Ashwood manor house with Lady Jean. Having inherited the baronetcy, he is addressed as \\"Sir John\\", even as a boy, and takes seriously his duties as proprietor of the manor. He develops a childhood infatuation with Betsy Kenney (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of a tenant farmer. Young John invites two visiting German boys to the manor for tea. The German boys shock the Ashwoods by spouting bellicose militaristic sentiments. Susan becomes afraid that there will be another war and that she will lose young John as she lost his father. After Lady Jean dies, she decides to sell the manor and take John to America. But when she tells him why, John refuses, insisting that he will go into the army as his father did, and fight for Britain if war comes. Susan changes her mind, and they stay in Britain. World War II begins, and Sir John (now played by Peter Lawford) becomes an officer, while his sweetheart Betsy (now played by June Lockhart) becomes a Wren. The flashback ends, as wounded men arrive at Susan's hospital. To Susan's horror, John is among them, severely wounded. Later, in the wards, a doctor tells Susan John is dying. John tells her he was wounded in fighting at Dieppe and of an American soldier who died near him. He speaks of the importance of winning a complete victory and a lasting peace. At that moment, American soldiers again parade through London, passing by the hospital. Susan proudly describes them to John as he dies. Differences from source The source poem has no mention of a romantic partner for Susan's son, John. The poem clearly states that John is following his father into the army, but ends with only Susan's fear that John might die in the war, not that he has even been sent to fight yet. Cast The role of Betsy was shared.

One of the boys remarks that the estate's large lawns would be ideal for military gliders to land - a premonition of the airborne attacks launched by Nazi Germany. Box office According to MGM records, the film was a big hit and earned $6,294,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) at the box office, resulting in a profit of $1,784,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in Black and White.

They are found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Madagascar. It is placed in monotypic subfamily Leptopelinae, although this subfamily is not always recognized. They have a number of common names, including forest treefrogs, tree frogs, leaf- frogs, and big-eyed frogs. Description Leptopelis are mostly medium-sized frogs (snout‚Äìvent length ), but Leptopelis palmatus can reach . Tympanum is present. Most species have expended digit tips. Ecology Leptopelis are mainly arboreal, but some species, especially in more arid areas, are terrestrial or even subfossorial. Breeding typically starts with the heavy rains in the beginning of the wet season. Eggs may be deposited either in water or in/on the ground. Development includes a free-living tadpole stage, with a possible exception of Leptopelis brevirostris, whose large eggs suggest that development could be direct. Males typically call in bushes or trees a meter or more above the ground. Leptopelis kivuensis  Species  As of mid- October, 2019, there are 54 recognized species: The AmphibiaWeb recognized one additional species, Leptopelis broadleyi. Leptopelis vermiculatus  In captivity  L. vermiculatus is found in international pet trade. They are hardy frogs that adapt well to captivity, and readily consume commercially available crickets.

Nathan has been outspoken on the subject of faith and politics. In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch, he was quoted as saying: Nathan has also been a major force for immigration reform, highlighting the issue in both sermons and op-eds. He advocates for a different plan than those traditionally offered for America's illegal immigrants, \\"a pathway to citizenship governed by a system of checks and balances.\\" He has led Vineyard Columbus to embrace racial and ethnic diversity. Vineyard Columbus is one of America's most diverse churches, having attendees from over 125 nations. Nathan has been a leader in the Vineyard movement in advocating for women's full participation in all aspects of church ministry including becoming senior pastors, church planters, missionaries and Vineyard Association overseers. As Nathan put it in a message on egalitarianism: \\"God's gifts and call are not gender-based.\\" Vineyard Columbus Vineyard Columbus (formerly Vineyard Christian Fellowship of Columbus and Vineyard Church of Columbus) is a church in Westerville, Ohio. It is part of the Association of Vineyard Churches with headquarters in Sugar Land, Texas. Vineyard Columbus dates back as a church to the late-1970s. Three different churches joined together to form the first church. The church remained independent of any larger group for a number of years. After investigating a number of groups to join with, the leadership of the church decided on the Association of Vineyard Churches, led by John Wimber. They became the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of Columbus in 1987. Vineyard Columbus has experienced significant growth over the years, drawing about 7,500 people from over 125 nations at its weekend worship services and becoming the largest church in the Vineyard movement today. It is a church that is self described as an \\"empowered evangelical\\" church, according to the definition in Rich Nathan and Ken Wilson's book Empowered Evangelicals that was published in the mid-1990s. The original church in Westerville has planted more than 30 churches since 1987,Vineyard Church of Columbus including over a dozen in the Columbus area - all included in the Vineyard Movement. Vineyard Columbus also supports many Christian missionaries throughout the world. In January 2019, Rich announced he will be handing the senior pastor duties over to associate pastors Eric and Julia Pickerill, effective January 2021. Eric and Julia planted the Vineyard of Amsterdam in 2008 before returning to Vineyard Columbus in 2015. Rich Nathan will remain of the staff at Vineyard Columbus as pastor at-large.

The term also includes places where such animals are raised to be sold as food or for photography. Their existence has been exemplified within the South African countryside where they have become prevalent. The wildlife that is hunted is used for consumption as well for ecotourism. Local laws in South Africa during the 20th century have allowed the private ownership of wildlife, which has enabled the expansion and economic feasibility of game farms over typical livestock farming.  Wildlife Conservation  Wildlife conservation is a costly endeavor for most African countries. One of the more common forms of generating income to establish a sustainable economy to provide for wildlife conservation is known as wildlife viewing tourism. However, this attraction still does not generate enough to establish wildlife conservation. For regions that suffer political and economic instability; sustainable trophy hunting may be the only feasible source of income in order to generate the appropriate income. Once established, another aspect to consider is the management of the land being used for hunting. Naturally, wildlife decreases with the increase of human presence which puts a strain on the quality of hunting. Generally, leases for hunting concessions are set up to last for multiple years all at once in order to encourage hunting operators to continue to manage the land for hunting. However, as the quality of hunting decreases, leases are shortened and this creates an overall negative impact to the economy. Many African countries benefit from community based conservation. This concept explores the relationship between wild life and people and the notion that conserving every animal is also not sustainable because certain animals threaten human lives and crops. One of the biggest arguments in support of community based conservation is that allowing people to gain economic benefits from wildlife, incentives for conservation are, in turn, provided. One such country that benefits from adopting this strategy is Zambia. The Zambian government established a wild life conservation fund to act as the responsible player for redistributing funds from the hunting industry into wild life conservation and community development.  Ethical Problems  Using game hunting as a conservation tool has negative perceptions that impose harsh restrictions across several different countries in Africa. Some of the activities that promote hunting bans include canned hunting, shooting young or uncommon animals, shooting from vehicles, use of bait, spotlights and hounds are all hunting practices that bring into question many ethical problems. Furthermore, on an international level, there are ethical issues such as the hunting and killing of Cecil the Lion. An American doctor by the name of Walter James Palmer, of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, killed Cecil the Lion during a hunting trip in Zimbabwe. This news made international headlines as Cecil the Lion was a participant in a study that was being conducted by Oxford University in Britain, Cecil had also been outfitted with a GPS collar for this study. Eventually, Palmer was not charged in the slaying of Cecil due to his hunting permit and has been allowed back in the country exclusively as a visitor.  Game Farming in South Africa  South Africa is considered to be one of the hallmarks for game farms and game reserves. The biodiverse ecosystem that exists in South Africa is the foundation that provides one of the most prosperous game meat in the African continent. The land displays a diverse array of animals such as the Big Five; lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and Cape buffalo. Game farms are said to have produced new avenues for prosperity such as trophy hunting, game-meat production, and eco-tourism. File:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004 edit1.jpgMale lion and cub feeding on a Cape buffalo, Sabi Sand Game Reserve  Ecotourism Component  Tourism is viewed as key strategy that can eventually lead to economic prosperity which in turn would promote development in the local communities. The South African government has capitalized on this through utilizing their wildlife to promote ecotourism. Post-apartheid, significant developments have been made to achieve success in this area. Today, an abundance of tourists and travelers flock to South Africa with their main goal being to see its natural environment. Game Farms are said to deliver a unique experience because they provide the opportunity for visitors to observe and experience wildlife at close range. The South African government has made efforts to utilize these game farms as developed sustainable ecotourism attractions. Wildlife hunters are extremely attracted to private games farms which can produce higher income compared some of South Africa‚Äôs most successful nature reserves. The commercial success of these game farms has forced many agricultural farms to adapt and be converted into game farms.  Controversy in the Eastern Cape  Game farming in the Eastern Cape has been cited as land-use practice issue which has left many feeling disenfranchised This stems from the context of wealth, class, and race which are said have created a diverse range of problems for local communities. People who do not have the financial structure to enter a game farm are said to appropriate bushmeat through illegal hunting where poachers are the primary actors. Structural inequalities between various stakeholders are at the epicenter of the issue. Game farms create network that is internationally proactive and interconnected but fractured at the local level due to racial inequalities that have plagued South Africa. This dichotomy of the two networks have created spaces for international clients and local elites to congregate and engage in trophy hunting due to private ownership which in turn ignores the advancement of rural employment.

His books on architectural design published in Leningrad between 1927 and 1933 are amongst the most innovatory texts (and illustrations) of their time.  Early life  Chernikov was born to a poor family, one of 11 children. After studying at the Grekov Odessa Art school, Ukraine he moved in 1914 to Petrograd (St. Petersburg) and joined the Architecture faculty of the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1916, where he later studied under Leon Benois.  Career  Greatly interested in futurist movements, including constructivism, and the suprematism of Malevich (with whom he was acquainted), he set out his ideas in a series of books in the late 1920s and early 1930s, including: * The Art of Graphic Representation (1927) * Fundamentals of Contemporary Architecture (1930) * The Construction of Architectural and Machine Forms (1931) * 101 Architectural Fantasies (1933). The latter, a very fine example of colour printing, was perhaps the last avant-garde art book to be published in Russia during the Stalinist era. Its remarkable designs uncannily predict the architecture of the later 20th century. However his unusual ideas meant that Chernikhov was distrusted by the regime. Although he continued work as a teacher and held a number of one-man shows, few of his designs were built and very few appear to have survived. Amongst the latter is the tower of the 'Red Nailer' factory in St. Petersburg. Chernikhov also produced a number of richly designed architectural fantasies of historic architecture, which were never exhibited in his lifetime. A book on 'The Construction of Letter Forms' containing some of his typographical designs, was published after his death, in 1959. Chernikhov produced some 17,000 drawings and projects and was dubbed the Soviet Piranesi. Mercatorfonds, Antwerp and Eaton, Ruth. 2001. Ideal Cities: Utopianism and the (Un)Built Environment, pp.193-194. . On 8 August 2006, it was announced that some hundreds of Chernikhov's drawings, with an estimated value of $1,300,000, had gone missing from the Russian State Archives. Some 274 have been recovered, in Russia and abroad.BBC News. 8 August 2006. Valuable Russian drawings stolen. Accessed at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5255860.stm on 10 September 2009.

The centre and south of the island is retained as a cultural preserve for indigenous peoples and has an area of . Geography The park forms part of the large river island of Bananal Island in the Araguaia River in the southwest of the state of Tocantins, in Brazil. The park is largely flat land and lies at an altitude of above sea level. It is situated at the junction of the Amazon biome to the north and the grassland and stunted woodland biome to the south; the river is subject to large fluctuations in level and the park is subject to periodic flooding. The flora consists of a mixture of savannah grassland, scrub and deciduous forest. Rainfall is most frequent between November and March and the hottest time of year is during September and October. The park would be in the proposed South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor. Flora There are piassava palms and buriti palms in parts of the park that are frequently inundated. In the forested areas some frequently encountered species include the cow tree, Cabralea, Tabebuia, Qualea parviflora, black sweetwood and genipap. In the drier savannah part of the park there are many species of grasses, with scattered trees such as the souari nut tree and the pau-d'alho. Fauna There is a wide range of mammals in the park including marsh deer, other species of deer, peccary, capybara, giant anteater, maned wolf, jaguar, giant otter and armadillo. The reptiles present include the anaconda, spectacled caiman, black caiman and South American river turtle, and the rivers are home to many freshwater fish as well as Amazon river dolphins and Tucuxi dolphins. There are plenty of birds too, including the common toucan, anhinga, greater rhea, quail, partridge, osprey, Orinoco goose, heron. egret, Spix's macaw, hoatzin and musician wren.

While a large part of the film is a satire of the film industry, it also skewers relationships from various angles. Its primary plot concerns a down-on-his-luck actor who suddenly finds himself the sole caretaker of his six-year-old daughter. Plot In 1980, on the night he fails to win an Emmy Award, Matt Hobbs proposes to his longtime girlfriend Beth. He says the only thing holding him back is his dedication to his career, one which may not always work out, and Beth says that's one of the things she loves most about him. Seven years later, with a baby crying and no job for Matt, Beth is overflowing with resentment. By 1993, the pair have been divorced for several years and are living on opposite coasts. Matt auditions for a role in pompous, self-absorbed, and clueless film producer Burke Adler's new project but fails to get the part. He does however agree to chauffeur Adler occasionally. Matt flies to Georgia to pick up his daughter Jeannie for what he believes is a brief visit and discovers Beth is facing a prison term and Jeannie will be living with him for the duration of her sentence. The two return to Hollywood and struggle with their new circumstances and building a relationship (Matt hasn't seen the six-year-old since she was four). When Matt goes in to make a screen test for a lead in a film, he leaves Jeannie with a friend at the studio, and when he picks her up he's stunned to learn she's been cast in a sitcom. There are multiple sub-plots, including one focusing on Matt's relationship with staff script-reader Cathy Breslow and another concerning test screening analyst Nan Mulhanney and her tumultuous relationship with Adler. CastProduction Originally I'll Do Anything was conceived and filmed by James L. Brooks as an old-fashioned movie musical and parody of \\"Hollywood lifestyles and movie clich√©s\\", costing $40 million. It featured songs by Carole King, Prince, and Sin√©ad O'Connor, among others, with choreography by Twyla Tharp. When preview audience reactions to the music were overwhelmingly negative, all production numbers from the film were cut and Brooks wrote several new scenes, filming them over three days and spent seven weeks editing the film. Brooks noted: \\"Something like this not only tries one's soul - it threatens one's soul.\\" He later said of the film, Reaction I'll Do Anything received mixed to positive reviews from critics. It currently holds a rating of 61% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews. In his three-star review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert called it \\"one of those offcenter comedies that gets its best moments simply by looking at people and seeing how funny, how pathetic, how wonderful they sometimes can be . . . it's a bright, edgy, funny story about people who have all the talent they need, but not all the luck . . . It is helpful, I think, to simply forget about the missing songs, and recognize that I'll Do Anything is a complete movie without them - smart, original, subversive.\\"Roger Ebert review in the Chicago Sun-Times, February 4, 1994 Janet Maslin of the New York Times described it as \\"droll\\" and \\"improbably buoyant.\\"Janet Maslin review in the New York Times, February 4, 1994 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B-\\" on scale of A to F.

Although James L. Brooks has mentioned he would like to release a director's cut restoring the musical numbers and including a making-of documentary, that project has yet to come to fruition. The film's commercially released version is available on DVD. In a 2013 interview, Zimmer said that a release of the musical version is unlikely: \\"The deal structure on those songs was so complicated and so expensive, and it would cost so much money in rights to put it out.‚Äù In an interview on Off Camera with Sam Jones, Jackson Browne stated that his song \\"I'll Do Anything\\", released on the 1993 album I'm Alive was originally written to be the title song for the movie.

Despite ranking 37th in size by area, Kentucky has 120 counties; depending on definitions, this is either third or fourth among U.S. states. Texas has 254 counties and Georgia 159; Virginia has only 95 counties, but also has 38 independent cities that are not part of any county and deal directly with the state government, giving that state 133 county-level administrative units. The original motivation for having so many counties was to ensure that residents in the days of poor roads and horseback travel could make a round trip from their home to the county seat and back in a single day, as well as being able to travel from one county seat to the next in the same fashion. Later, however, politics began to play a part, with citizens who disagreed with the present county government simply petitioning the state to create a new county. Today, 20 of the 120 counties have fewer than 10,000 residents, and half have fewer than 20,000. However the 20 largest counties by population all have populations of 50,000 or higher. The average county population, based on an estimated 2017 state population of 4.454 million, was 37,117. The 1891 Kentucky Constitution placed stricter limits on county creation, stipulating that a new county: *must have a land area of at least ; *must have a population of at least 12,000 people; *must not by its creation reduce the land area of an existing county to less than 400 square miles; *must not by its creation reduce the population of an existing county to fewer than 12,000 people; *must not create a county boundary line that passes within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of an existing county seat. These regulations have reined in the proliferation of counties in Kentucky. Since the 1891 Constitution, only McCreary County has been legally created, in 1912. The General Assembly's creation of Beckham County in 1904 was ruled unconstitutional. Because today's largest county by area, Pike County, is , it is now impossible to create a new county from a single existing county under the current constitution. Any county to be created in this manner will necessarily reduce the land area of the old county to less than . It is still possible to form a new county from portions of more than one existing county; McCreary County was formed in this manner, from parts of Wayne, Pulaski and Whitley counties. The largest city in Kentucky, Louisville, is a consolidated local government under KRS 67C. The second largest, Lexington, is an urban-county government under KRS 67A. Lexington and Fayette County are completely merged and there are no separate incorporated cities within the county. When the Louisville Metro government was formed, all incorporated cities in Jefferson County, apart from Louisville, retained their status as cities; however, the Louisville Metro Council is the main government for the entire county, and is elected by residents in all of Jefferson County. In both of these counties, while Lexington and Louisville city governments govern their respective counties, a county Fiscal Court (Kentucky's governing body for counties) is still elected, as required by Kentucky's Constitution. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry; for Kentucky the codes start with 21 and are completed with the three digit county code. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county. Forty-one counties (Adair, Allen, Ballard, Barren, Breckinridge, Butler, Caldwell, Calloway, Carlisle, Christian, Clinton, Crittenden, Cumberland, Daviess, Edmonson, Fulton, Graves, Grayson, Green, Hancock, Hart, Henderson, Hickman, Hopkins, Livingston, Logan, Lyon, Marshall, McCracken, McLean, Metcalfe, Monroe, Muhlenberg, Ohio, Russell, Simpson, Todd, Trigg, Union, Warren and Webster counties) lie in the Central Time Zone.

History=First lira The Duchy of Parma issued its own currency until it was annexed to France in 1802. This lira was subdivided into 20 soldi (singular: soldo), each of 12 denari (singular: denaro), with the sesino worth 6 denari and the ducato was worth 7 lire. The currency was replaced by the French franc. Second lira After the re- establishment of Parman independence, a national currency was introduced in 1815. Also called the lira, it was subdivided into 20 soldi or 100 centesimi. However, this lira was equal to the French franc and the Sardinian lira, and it circulated alongside the latter. It weighed 5 grams, and had a purity of 9/10 of silver. Since 1860, Parma has used the equivalent Italian lira. Coins=First lira In the late 18th century, circulation coins included copper 1 sesino, billon 5, 10 and 20 soldi, silver ¬Ω, 1, 3 and 6 lire, and 1/14, 1/7, ¬Ω, and 1 ducato. Gold coins were issued in denominations of 1 zecchino and ¬Ω, 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 doppia. Second lira In 1815, silver coins were introduced in denominations of 5 and 10 soldi, 1, 2 and 5 lire, together with gold 20 and 40 lire. Copper 1, 3 and 5 centesimi were added in 1830. All coins until the death of Marie Louise were minted by the Austrian State in Milan. When the House of Bourbon rose to the throne in 1847, the Parman mint was re-opened but the intended issue of copper 1, 2 and 5 centesimi was abandoned after the duke Charles III, whose effigy was presented on the coins, was assassinated in 1854. The only issued coin, 5 lira of 1858, was struck in 1000 copies.

Plot After winning a lifetime achievement award, esteemed successful screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) has a rude awakening. Steven believes the award has no real meaning, but it does‚Äîit means his career is over. His studio has reneged that means they won't renew his contract and told him he's gone cold, saying he's \\"lost his edge.\\" A junior exec named Josh Martin (Mark Feuerstein) tells Steven his new script is dull and to be off the lot by 5 p.m. Taken by surprise, the Oscar-nominated writer is desperate to revive his career. He seeks the advice of a very successful screenwriter buddy, Jack (Bridges), who arranges an introduction to Sarah (Stone), a modern-day muse who can inspire anyone. Sarah, however, has conditions and unnecessarily lavish needs, such as expensive hotel rooms and gifts from Tiffany & Co. Steven is forced to make good on those conditions, much to the chagrin of his wife Laura (MacDowell). Steven isn't sure if the muse could be the real thing or just somebody sucking him dry of his money and patience. She takes him to Long Beach, where they encounter writer-director Rob Reiner, someone Sarah clearly knows. Steven gets an idea for a movie set in an aquarium and thinks of Jim Carrey as the lead. As Sarah's demands increase, Steven's apprehensive wife begins to be won over. Through the muse's encouragement Laura decides to pursue her dream of baking and selling cookies, to much fanfare and success. To save money, Sarah is invited by the Phillipses to move into their house. Steven, however, is frustrated because Sarah spends more time helping others‚Äînotably Hollywood writers and directors like James Cameron and Martin Scorsese, who come to Steven's house to see her. Steven even surrenders his own bedroom to Sarah and sleeps in the guest house. When he pleads for a way to end his aquarium screenplay, Sarah does point Steven in the right direction and inspires him with a great idea. Steven's agent Hal is thrilled and urges him to finish the script as quickly as possible. Steven did finish the script, when he heard Sara's advice. The following morning, though, two visitors come to Steven's home, revealing that they are doctors from a mental clinic. They tell Steven that Sarah is an escaped psychiatric patient from their asylum who has multiple personality disorder. They find the whole \\"muse\\" idea hilarious. When they try to find Sarah to take her back, they discover that she has escaped. They decide not to go after her, since she can come and go anytime she wants. The junior exec, Josh, loves Steven's script, but he breaks the news that the idea is already in production at another studio‚Äîby Rob Reiner. A broken- hearted Steven goes to work in his wife's new cookie business. Things turn around when the agent calls to inform Steven that the Reiner project fell through and the studio wants to purchase his version, contingent upon a few changes being made. An excited Steven goes to the studio, where a secretary reveals that the studio fired Josh for stealing and they have a new boss, Christine, is now in charge. Steven is shocked to see Christine is Sarah in a long black wig. She takes Steven's arm and insists that they discuss the changes over a nice, expensive lunch, which she expects him to pay for. Steven frantically tries to comprehend what is happening.

Reception The Muse was a slight box office flop, grossing about $11 million domestically on an estimated budget of $15 million. It did relatively poorly at the box office compared to some of Brooks' other films, such as Defending Your Life (1991), which made $16 million, and Mother (1996), which made $19 million. Most complained that the problem was Brooks' lacking energy in his direction of the film. Critical reception was lukewarm, with the film holding a 53% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 78 reviews, with the consensus; \\"Despite quirky and original writing, the subject matter feels too removed to produce laughs.\\", but critics who were fans of the film included Leonard Maltin, Roger Ebert, and Desson Howe. Wade Major, writing in Boxoffice, called it ‚Äúa first-rate Hollywood satire that fearlessly goes so far as to even name names. Agents, executives, directors, actors and even writers are given their lumps‚Äîmany showing up to do the on-screen damage themselves in a cascade of self-deprecating cameos. Stone‚Äôs dizzy Muse, however, is the film‚Äôs most delightful surprise, providing an energetic counterpoint to Brooks‚Äô neurotic fatalism‚Ä¶‚Äù Major, Wade. Boxoffice, Aug 1, 1999: 52. Variety critic Todd McCarthy thought it ‚ÄúTypically fresh and idiosyncratic in the writing but often flat directorially.‚Äù McCarthy also believed that its commercial potential was restricted to ‚Äúsophisticated upscale audiences.‚ÄùVariety, Aug 16, 1999: 28-29. Janet Maslin, in the New York Times, however, thought it was ‚Äúone of Mr. Brooks‚Äôs most broadly entertaining films,‚Äù with ‚Äúenough of a stellar twinkle to bring it to a more general audience.‚ÄùThe Price of Success: THE MUSE. New York Times, 27 Aug 1999: E1. Roger Ebert thought ‚Äúthe movie is good but not great Brooks; not the equal of ‚ÄòLost in America‚Äô or ‚ÄòMother,‚Äô but smart, funny‚Äîand edgy.‚Äù https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-muse-1999 Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan wrote, ‚ÄúUnderneath all its humor, ‚ÄòThe Muse‚Äô manages to casually deal with some fascinating issues, such as the nature of creativity and inspiration and the important role belief has in making things happen. After all, as someone says, ‚ÄòThis is Hollywood. People here believe anything.‚Äô‚ÄùTuran, Kenneth. Los Angeles Times, 27 Aug 1999: 1. Golden Globe controversy In 1999, Helmut Voss, then president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, who give the annual Golden Globe Awards, ordered all 82 of its members to return gift luxury watches sent by either Sharon Stone or USA/October Films (now merged into Focus Features). The luxury watches were considered promotions for a nomination for Stone's performance in the film. According to Variety, Voss ordered the return of the gifts \\"to protect the integrity of its award\\". Stone received the nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but lost to Janet McTeer for Tumbleweeds.

International Year of Astronomy commemorative coin. The International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) was a year-long celebration of astronomy that took place in 2009 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first recorded astronomical observations with a telescope by Galileo Galilei and the publication of Johannes Kepler's Astronomia nova in the 17th century. The Year was declared by the 62nd General Assembly of the United Nations. A global scheme, laid out by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), was also endorsed by UNESCO, the UN body responsible for educational, scientific, and cultural matters. The IAU coordinated the International Year of Astronomy in 2009. This initiative was an opportunity for the citizens of Earth to gain a deeper insight into astronomy's role in enriching all human cultures. Moreover, served as a platform for informing the public about the latest astronomical discoveries while emphasizing the essential role of astronomy in science education. IYA2009 was sponsored by Celestron and Thales Alenia Space. Significance of 1609 On 25 September 1608, Hans Lippershey, a spectacle-maker from Middelburg, traveled to the Hague, the then capital of the Netherlands, to demonstrate to the Dutch government a new device he was trying to patent: a telescope. Although Hans was not awarded the patent, Galileo heard of this story and decided to use the \\"Dutch perspective glass\\" and point it towards the heavens. In 1609, Galileo Galilei first turned one of his telescopes to the night sky and made astounding discoveries that changed mankind's conception of the world: mountains and craters on the Moon, a plethora of stars invisible to the naked eye, and moons around Jupiter. Astronomical observatories around the world promised to reveal how planets and stars are formed, how galaxies assemble and evolve, and what the structure and shape of our Universe actually are. In the same year, Johannes Kepler published his work Astronomia nova, in which he described the fundamental laws of planetary motions. However Galileo was not the first to observe the Moon through a telescope and make a drawing of it. Thomas Harriot observed and detailed the Moon some months before Galileo. \\"It's all about publicity. Galileo was extremely good at irritating people and also using creative writing to communicate what he was learning in a way that made people think,\\" says Pamela Gay in an interview with Skepticality in 2009. Intended purpose U.S. President Barack Obama views a double star in the constellation Lyra through an 8\\" Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope during the 2009 White House Astronomy Night. Vision The vision of IYA2009 was to help people rediscover their place in the Universe through the sky, and thereby engage a personal sense of wonder and discovery. IYA2009 activities took place locally, nationally, regionally and internationally. National Nodes were formed in each country to prepare activities for 2009. These nodes established collaborations between professional and amateur astronomers, science centres and science communicators. More than 100 countries were involved, and well over 140 participated eventually. To help coordinate this huge global programme and to provide an important resource for the participating countries, the IAU established a central Secretariat and the IYA2009 website as the principal IYA2009 resource for public, professionals and media alike. Aims Astronomy, perhaps the oldest science in history, has played an important role in most, if not all, cultures over the ages. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 (IYA2009) was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy, but in science in general, with a particular slant towards young people. The IYA2009 marked the monumental leap forward that followed Galileo's first use of the telescope for astronomical observations, and portrays astronomy as a peaceful global scientific endeavour that unites amateur and professional astronomers in an international and multicultural family that works together to find answers to some of the most fundamental questions that humankind has ever asked. The aim of the Year was to stimulate worldwide interest in astronomy and science under the central theme \\"The Universe, Yours to Discover.\\" Several committees were formed to oversee the vast majority of IYA2009 activities (\\"sidewalk astronomy\\" events in planetariums and public observatories), which spun local, regional and national levels. These committees were collaborations between professional and amateur astronomers, science centres and science communicators. Individual countries were undertaking their own initiatives as well as assessing their own national needs, while the IAU acted as the event's coordinator and catalyst on a global scale. The IAU plan was to liaise with, and involve, as many as possible of the ongoing outreach and education efforts throughout the world, including those organized by amateur astronomers. Goals The major goals of IYA2009 were to: # Increase scientific awareness; # Promote widespread access to new knowledge and observing experiences; # Empower astronomical communities in developing countries; # Support and improve formal and informal science education; # Provide a modern image of science and scientists; # Facilitate new networks and strengthen existing ones; # Improve the gender-balanced representation of scientists at all levels and promote greater involvement by underrepresented minorities in scientific and engineering careers; # Facilitate the preservation and protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage of dark skies in places such as urban oases, national parks and astronomical sites. As part of the scheme, IYA2009 helped less-well-established organizations from the developing world to become involved with larger organizations and deliver their contributions, linked via a huge global network. This initiative also aimed at reaching economically disadvantaged children across the globe and enhancing their understanding of the world. The Secretariat The central hub of the IAU activities for the IYA2009 was the IYA2009 Secretariat. This was established to coordinate activities during the planning, execution and evaluation of the Year. The Secretariat was based in the European Southern Observatory headquarters in the town of Garching near Munich, Germany. The Secretariat was to liaise continuously with the National Nodes, Task Groups, Partners and Organizational Associates, the media and the general public to ensure the progress of the IYA2009 at all levels. The Secretariat and the website were the major coordination and resource centers for all the participating countries, but particularly for those developing countries that lack the national resources to mount major events alone. Cornerstone projects The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was supported by eleven Cornerstone projects. These are global programs of activities centered on specific themes and are some of the projects that helped to achieve IYA2009's main goals; whether it is the support and promotion of women in astronomy, the preservation of dark-sky sites around the world or educating and explaining the workings of the Universe to millions, the eleven Cornerstones were the key elements in the success of IYA2009. 100 Hours of Astronomy 100 Hours of Astronomy (100HA) is a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2‚Äì5 April 2009 and was part of the scheduled global activities of the International Year of Astronomy 2009. The main goal of 100HA was to have as many people throughout the world as possible looking through a telescope just as Galileo did for the first time 400 years ago. The event included special webcasts, students and teachers activities, a schedule of events at science centers, planetariums and science museums as well as 24 hours of sidewalk astronomy, which allowed the opportunity for public observing sessions to as many people as possible. Galileoscope The Galileoscope was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2‚Äì5 April 2009, where the program was to share a personal experience of practical astronomical observations with as many people as possible across the world. It was collaborating with the US IYA2009 National Node to develop a simple, accessible, easy-to-assemble and easy-to-use telescope that can be distributed by the millions. In theory, every participant in an IYA2009 event should be able to take home one of these little telescopes, enabling them to observe with an instrument similar to Galileo's one. Cosmic Diary The Cosmic Diary, a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2‚Äì5 April, was not about the science of astronomy, but about what it is like to be an astronomer. Professionals were to blog in texts and images about their life, families, friends, hobbies and interests, as well as their work, latest research findings and the challenges they face. The bloggers represented a vibrant cross-section of working astronomers from all around the world. They wrote in many different languages, from five continents. They have also written feature article \\"explanations\\" about their specialist fields, which were highlighted in the website. NASA, ESA and ESO all had sub-blogs as part of the Cosmic Diary Cornerstone. The Portal to the Universe The Portal to the Universe (PTTU) was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2‚Äì5 April 2009, to provide a global, one-stop portal for online astronomy contents, serving as an index, aggregator and a social-networking site for astronomy content providers, laypeople, press, educators, decision-makers and scientists. PTTU was to feature news, image, event and video aggregation; a comprehensive directory of observatories, facilities, astronomical societies, amateur astronomy societies, space artists, science communication universities; and Web 2.0 collaborative tools, such as the ranking of different services according to popularity, to promote interaction within the astronomy multimedia community. In addition, a range of \\"widgets\\" (small applications) were to be developed to tap into existing \\"live data\\". Modern technology and the standardisation of metadata made it possible to tie all the suppliers of such information together with a single, semi-automatically updating portal. She Is an Astronomer Promoting gender equality and empowering women is one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. She Is an Astronomer was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2‚Äì5 April 2009, to promote gender equality in astronomy (and science in general), tackling bias issues by providing a web platform where information and links about gender balance and related resources are collected. The aim of the project was to provide neutral, informative and accessible information to female professional and amateur astronomers, students, and those who are interested in the gender equality problem in science. Providing this information was intended to help increase the interest of young girls in studying and pursuing a career in astronomy. Another objective of the project was to build and maintain an Internet-based, easy-to-handle forum and database, where people regardless of geographical location could read about the subject, ask questions and find answers. There was also to be the option to discuss astronomy-sector-specific problems, such as observing times and family duties. Dark Skies Awareness Dark Skies Awareness was a worldwide astronomy event that ran from 2 to 5 April 2009. The IAU collaborated with the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), representatives of the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), the Starlight Initiative, and other national and international partners in dark-sky and environmental education on several related themes. The focus was on three main citizen-scientist programs to measure local levels of light pollution. These programs were to take the form of \\"star hunts\\" or \\"star counts\\", providing people with a fun and direct way to acquire heightened awareness about light pollution through firsthand observations of the night sky. Together, the three programs were to cover the entire International Year of Astronomy 2009, namely GLOBE at Night (in March), the Great World Wide Star Count (in October) and How Many Stars (January, February, April through September, November and December). UNESCO and the IAU were working together to implement a research and education collaboration as part of UNESCO's thematic initiative, Astronomy and World Heritage as a worldwide astronomy event that also ran 2‚Äì5 April 2009. The main objective was to establish a link between science and culture on the basis of research aimed at acknowledging the cultural and scientific values of properties connected with astronomy. This programme provides an opportunity to identify properties related to astronomy located around the world, to preserve their memory and save them from progressive deterioration. Support from the international community is needed to implement this activity and to promote the recognition of astronomical knowledge through the nomination of sites that celebrate important achievements in science. Galileo Teacher Training Program The Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP): the International Year of Astronomy 2009 provided an opportunity to engage the formal education community in the excitement of astronomical discovery as a vehicle for improving the teaching of science in classrooms around the world. To help training teachers in effective astronomy communication and to sustain the legacy of IYA2009, the IAU ‚Äì in collaboration with the National Nodes and leaders in the field such as the Global Hands-On Universe project, the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ‚Äì embarked on a unique global effort to empower teachers by developing the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP). The GTTP goal was to create a worldwide network of certified \\"Galileo Ambassadors\\" by 2012. These Ambassadors were to train \\"Galileo Master Teachers\\" in the effective use and transfer of astronomy education tools and resources into classroom science curricula. The Galileo Teachers were to be equipped to train other teachers in these methodologies, leveraging the work begun during IYA2009 in classrooms everywhere. Through workshops, online training tools and basic education kits, the products and techniques developed by this program could be adapted to reach locations with few resources of their own, as well as computer-connected areas that could take advantage of access to robotic optical and radio telescopes, webcams, astronomy exercises, cross-disciplinary resources, image processing and digital universes (web and desktop planetariums). Among GTTP partners, the Global Hands-On Universe project was a leader. Universe Awareness Universe Awareness (UNAWE) was a worldwide astronomy event that also ran during 2‚Äì5 April 2009, as an international program to introduce very young children in under-privileged environments to the scale and beauty of the Universe. Universe Awareness noted the multicultural origins of modern astronomy in an effort to broaden children's minds, awaken their curiosity in science and stimulate global citizenship and tolerance. Using the sky and children's natural fascination with it as common ground, UNAWE was to create an international awareness of their place in the Universe and their place on Earth. From Earth to the Universe \\"From Earth to the Universe\\" Movie Poster. The Cornerstone project From Earth to the Universe (FETTU) is a worldwide public science event that began in June 2008, and still ongoing through 2011. This project has endeavored to bring astronomy images and their science to a wider audience in non-traditional informal learning venues. In placing these astronomy exhibitions in public parks, metro stations, art centers, hospitals, shopping malls and other accessible locations, it has been hoped that individuals who might normally ignore or even dislike astronomy, or science in general, will be engaged. Developing Astronomy Globally The Developing Astronomy Globally was a worldwide astronomy event that ran during 2‚Äì5 April 2009, as a Cornerstone project to acknowledge that astronomy needs to be developed in three key areas: professionally (universities and research); publicly (communication, media, and amateur groups) and educationally (schools and informal education structures). The focus was to be on regions that do not already have strong astronomical communities. The implementation was to be centred on training, development and networking in each of these three key areas. This Cornerstone was using the momentum of IYA2009 to help establish and enhance regional structures and networks that work on the development of astronomy around the world. These networks were to support the current and future development work of the IAU and other programmes, plus ensure that developing regions could benefit from IYA2009 and the work of the other Cornerstone projects. It was to also address the question of the contribution of astronomy to development. Galilean Nights The Galilean Nights was a worldwide astronomy event that also ran 2‚Äì5 April 2009, as a project to involve both amateur and professional astronomers around the globe, taking to the streets their telescopes and pointing them as Galileo did 400 years ago. The sources of interest were Jupiter and its moons, the Sun, our Moon and many others celestial marvels. The event was scheduled to take place on 22‚Äì24 October 2009. Astronomers were to share their knowledge and enthusiasm for space by encouraging as many people as possible to look through a telescope at planetary neighbours.

The play was written by Ian Curteis, an experienced writer who had started his television career in drama, but had increasingly come to specialise in dramatic reconstructions of history. It was originally commissioned by the BBC in 1983, for production and broadcast in 1986, but was subsequently shelved by Controller of BBC One Michael Grade due to its pro-Margaret Thatcher stance and alleged jingoistic tone. This prompted a press furore over media bias and censorship. The play was not staged until 2002, when it was broadcast in separate adaptations on BBC Television and Radio. Plot The play focuses on the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the British government's handling of the United Kingdom's largest Foreign Affairs emergency since the Suez Crisis of 1956, the diplomatic breakdown over the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands (the Islas Malvinas to the Argentines). In particular, it charts the behind- the-scenes dealings within Thatcher's Conservative government and between it and its military and the United States and Argentine governments, in the diplomatic breakdown that gave way to war and an eventual British victory. In response to the Argentinian invasion, the Thatcher government calls for a total maritime exclusion zone around the islands, and directs a large naval force to set sail for the islands. Lord Carrington resigns as Foreign Secretary, taking responsibility for the failure to foresee the invasion, a resignation which Thatcher reluctantly accepts; his replacement, Francis Pym, is a reticent member of the war cabinet, and cautions Thatcher against a military response, including in the presence of Alexander Haig and an American delegation. Haig enters the affair to attempt to mediate the dispute between the Thatcher and Argentinian sides, the latter led by the military dictator Leopoldo Galtieri. Secretary of State for Defence John Nott, acting on behalf of his government, demands total withdrawal of Argentinian garrisons, in compliance with UN Resolution 502. British response to the involvement of United Nations Secretary-General P√©rez de Cu√©llar is also portrayed. Other dramatic elements include portrayal of the internal dynamics of the war cabinet and the government's representations in the House of Commons‚Äîin response to Argentine landings on the British island of South Georgia and their subsequent reclaiming by British forces, the sinking of the Argentine naval cruiser, the ARA General Belgrano, and the losses of British life when the British guided missile destroyer HMS Sheffield was struck by an Argentine exocet missile. The drama ends with Thatcher's declaration of the end of hostilities in the House of Commons.

Curteis ‚Äì who was present at the meeting ‚Äì then sent Milne a copy of the published play, and as an afterthought said: \\"In a few years' time, I would like to write a similar sort of play about the Falklands Crisis.\\" Milne immediately commissioned the play, and after months of careful negotiation the contract was signed on 6 April 1983. During discussions between Curteis and Keith Williams, the BBC Head of Plays, Cedric Messina was chosen as producer, but it was quickly realised that tempers were still running high about the War, particularly in relation to the BBC's conduct during it, and so it was mutually agreed to put the project on hold. Curteis recommenced work on the play at the start of 1985, meeting many of the key players and visiting most of the locations that would be portrayed in the play. His research also involved reading most of what had already been published about the War, biographies of the chief protagonists, Hansard for the relevant Parliamentary debates, official reports, and the contemporary press coverage. He delivered the fourth draft of the script to the BBC in April 1986. The budget of ¬£1 million was approved, Messina officially appointed as producer, and David Giles as director. Studio time was booked in TC1 at BBC Television Centre (one of the largest television studios in Europe) for 24 January to 8 February 1987 inclusive,Ian Curteis The Falklands play: a television play, London: Hutchinson, 1987, p.18 with a planned transmission date of the following 2 April, the fifth anniversary of the Argentinian invasion. It was planned to last for around three hours, with a half-hour break for the Nine O'Clock News. At a meeting with Milne on 2 June 1986, Curteis raised the question of the general election that was expected to happen the following year, and asked whether it might compromise the planned transmission date of the play. Milne dismissed the possibility of an election before the Autumn of 1987 at the earliest, and stated: \\"I don't see that transmission in April presents any problem.\\" In early July the new Head of Plays Peter Goodchild (whose background was in documentaries, rather than drama) requested considerable modifications to the script, amongst them objecting to the portrayal of Thatcher's \\"private and instinctive self\\" ‚Äì as opposed to the \\"bellicose Iron Lady of the public scenes\\" ‚Äì and requesting the inclusion of discussions between members of the government about the possible effect of the War on the 1983 general election. Curteis declined the latter on the grounds that none of the relevant people he had interviewed had alluded to such conversations, and that there was no other record of them. In addition, he considered that attributing such fictional dialogue to real people could be libellous, although he had been quite willing to do exactly that for conversations between ‚Äì variously ‚Äì members of the Argentinian Junta, American envoy Alexander Haig, and the Pope. On 21 July, while Curteis was on holiday in Ireland, the BBC cancelled the play, citing the forthcoming General Election. Curteis mounted a robust defence, and as the press became involved at the end of September, pressure mounted on the BBC, especially when it was discovered that they were going ahead with Charles Wood's Tumbledown, which was claimed to have an \\"anti-Mrs-Thatcher's-Government theme,\\" even though at that point Wood's script had not been published and few people could have read it. Tumbledown had a planned transmission date in October 1987, closer to ‚Äì if not coinciding with ‚Äì the General Election than the planned broadcast of Curteis's play. Bill Cotton, the BBC's Managing Director of Television, issued a statement claiming: \\"Ian Curteis completed the first draft of his Falklands Play three and a half years after we had commissioned it... In our professional opinion, it is not a completed commission.\\" He also said it would be \\"irresponsible of the BBC at a time when the country is leading up to an election to embark on a play portraying a Prime Minister in office, other serving ministers and MPs.\\" He finished by denying the play had been cancelled for any other reason, and refuted suggestions that Goodchild had asked for amendments that would change the political slant of the script. A second statement by a BBC spokesman also referred to Curteis's \\"draft script,\\" and claimed: \\"No bookings had been made for studio time. It was too early for this to be done. There had been no commitment to the production of this play.\\" All of these claims either misrepresented the facts, or were completely contrary to either them or the assurances Milne had previously given to Curteis. Cotton later reiterated most of these points in a letter to The Sunday Telegraph on 22 February 1987, in which he also claimed that the BBC would be quite happy to release their rights to the play to another broadcaster, but they had had no such requests. In fact, there had been an approach from Anglia Television to buy the rights on the day the cancellation was announced, but it had been categorically refused \\"off the record\\" by Michael Grade, then Controller of BBC One. Coupled with the decision to continue with Tumbledown (although its transmission was eventually delayed until 31 May 1988), the whole furore led to accusations of censorship and left-wing bias at the BBC, particularly as the play depicted Thatcher as both a strong and sympathetic character. As arranged prior to the cancellation, the play was published in 1987 as a paperback by Hutchinson, but with the addition of an introduction by Curteis in which he gave his account of the whole affair. In 1991, as part of a wider season of programmes about censorship, Channel 4 included a reading of some dialogue from the play in the documentary The Liberal Conspiracy, in which Curteis was also interviewed. Channel 4 was subsequently criticised on its viewer comment programme Right to Reply for not having made their own full production of the play for the same season, as they had done with another banned BBC programme (an episode of Duncan Campbell's Secret Society). The Falklands Play was eventually produced simultaneously for both radio and television with almost identical casts, broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 6 April and the digital TV channel BBC Four on 10 April 2002. The television version was an amended and abridged 90-minute version of the script, omitting all of the material involving the Junta and the Pope. The TV transmission was preceded by a half-hour programme on the controversy surrounding the original production, and was followed by a studio debate on the issues raised by both the cancellation and the play itself.

The clade is believed to have originated over 14,000 years ago in the Near East. Origin Haplogroup V derives from the HV0a subclade of haplogroup HV. In 1998 it was argued that V spread over Europe from an Ice Age refuge in Iberia. However more recent estimates of the date of V would place it in the Neolithic. Distribution Haplogroup V is a relatively rare mtDNA haplogroup, occurring in around 4% of native Europeans. Its highest concentration is among the Saami people of northern Scandinavia (~59%). It has been found at a frequency of approximately 10% among the Maris of the Volga-Ural region, leading to the suggestion that this region might be the source of the V among the Saami. Haplogroup V has been observed at higher than average levels among Cantabrian people (15%) of northern Iberia, and among the adjacent Basque (10.4%). Haplogroup V is also found in parts of Northwest Africa.

Route 25 is a six- lane freeway from Bridgeport to northern Trumbull and a two-lane surface road the rest of the way to Brookfield. Route 25 was originally laid out as a toll road known as the Bridgeport and Newtown Turnpike in 1801. The Route 25 designation was assigned in 1932 to the turnpike alignment and additionally extended through New Milford all the way to Torrington. The route was cut back to its modern northern terminus in Brookfield in 1974, with U.S. Route 202 taking over the old alignment. The Bridgeport-Newtown corridor had been planned as an expressway since the 1950s. The modern Route 25 expressway was fully open by 1982. Route description Route 25 begins at an interchange with Interstate 95 in Bridgeport. For the first of the route, it is co-signed with the Route 8 freeway. After the split with Route 8, it continues as its own freeway through the town of Trumbull for another , providing partial access to the Merritt Parkway (Route 15) along its path through the town. The freeway portion ends at the junction with Route 111 on the northern edge of town. Signage for Route 25 southbound at exit 9 in Trumbull Route 25 continues northward as a surface road following Main Street into Monroe, where it intersects with the northern end of Route 59 in the village of Stepney. Upon entering Newtown, the road becomes known as South Main Street. After intersecting the eastern end of Route 302, it overlaps for with U.S. Route 6 northwest from the town center. After turning north onto Hawleyville Road, it intersects I-84 at Exit 9. For the rest of its length, Route 25 is a secondary minor arterial road, crossing Route 133, and ending at U.S. Route 202 in Brookfield. History Route 25 was originally laid out as a toll road known as the Bridgeport and Newtown Turnpike in 1801 and ran from Bridgeport via Newtown borough to Brookfield center. In 1848, the north and south ends were made free. In the south, tolls were no longer collected within the city limits of Bridgeport, and in the north, the road north of Newtown borough was made free. In 1886, Fairfield County dissolved all turnpike corporations in its jurisdiction, causing the Bridgeport and Newtown Turnpike to become a public road. Route 25 was designated along the old turnpike route in the 1932 state highway renumbering. When originally designated in 1932, Route 25 continued well beyond Brookfield, following Route 133 and Route 67 to New Milford (via Bridgewater), then turning northeast along modern Route 202 before terminating at Route 8 in Torrington. In April 1943, a portion of Routes 25 and 133 swapped alignments. Route 25 now connected to U.S. Route 7 in Brookfield and overlapped it to New Milford, bypassing Bridgewater. In 1963, Route 25 was extended further eastward to Route 44 in Canton after the relocation of Route 4\\\\. In 1974, U.S. Route 202 was relocated and the portion of Route 25 from Brookfield to Canton was taken over by US 202\\\\. Route 25 was truncated to its present terminus in Brookfield at this time. Expressway relocation Before the last segment of the Route 25 Expressway opened in 1982, Route 25 originally followed Main Street through Bridgeport northward to the present- day expressway terminus. The old Route 25 through Bridgeport became an extension of Route 111 when the expressway opened. The Route 25 expressway was originally planned to continue north to meet I-84 in Newtown, where a semi- directional interchange and freeway stub for the planned expressway connection was built. The planned extension was canceled in 1991, along with many other highway projects due to a fiscal crisis arising when Connecticut was especially hit hard by the Late 1980s recession. At that time Connecticut's economy was heavily reliant on the defense industry. The end of the Cold War combined with the recession resulted in a near-total collapse of Connecticut's industrial base, and a loss of billions of dollars in tax revenues generated by these industries. During the late 1990s, an alternative plan to widen the existing Route 25 to 4 lanes with a center turn lane in certain spots through Trumbull, Monroe, and Newtown was met with opposition, particularly in Newtown where there was strong opposition to any type of project that will change the existing profile of the Route 25 corridor, despite the high accident rate and congestion on the road. In the early 2000s the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) was forced to resort to a plan that will widen and improve intersections on Route 25 from the expressway terminus in Trumbull to the Monroe/Newtown town line, but opposition in Newtown has compelled ConnDOT to limit upgrades in that community to spot improvements at major intersections and routine maintenance and periodic rehabilitation or replacement of existing bridges and culverts without adding capacity to the road. To ease traffic congestion in Newtown, ConnDOT opened the Mile Hill Road Bypass (SR 860), cutting through the former Fairfield Hills Hospital property and connecting to I-84 and Route 34 at the freeway stub originally intended for Route 25 (now part of SSR 490). Under the belief an expressway will never be built along Route 25 or Route 34, ConnDOT plans to remove this freeway stub and the high-speed interchange, replacing it with a diamond interchange within the next 10 years. ConnDOT is also planning to build a rest area on land left over when the interchange conversion is complete. Current upgrades Between Route 111 in Trumbull and Route 59 in Stepney, the two-lane undivided arterial section of Route 25, carries dense traffic loads during the day. Most of the daily traffic backups are caused by vehicles waiting to make a left turn onto Tashua Road or Spring Hill Road in northern Trumbull. To alleviate traffic in this area, the following amends were initiated in 2007: * Add a right turn branch from CT-25 Southbound to CT-111 Southbound. * Upgrade the intersections at Tashua and Spring Hill Roads (more details to follow). * Replace signage and renumber exits from sequential to mileage-base numbering on the freeway portion between the Route 8 split and Route 111. CONNDOT anticipates letting this contract to bid in August 2014. (This project will not affect the exit numbers on the 25/8 concurrency, which will be renumbered under a separate contract to replace signage on Route 8.)Advertising Schedule of Projects, Connecticut Department of Transportation, Accessed Jan 22, 2014 Major intersectionsReferencesExternal links 025 Category:Transportation in Bridgeport, Connecticut Category:Danbury, Connecticut Category:Newtown, Connecticut Category:Trumbull, Connecticut Category:Transportation in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:U.S. Route 202 ","title":"Connecticut Route 25"},{"id":"4143800","text":"Rey Washam (born Reynolds Washam, March 14, 1961, in Austin, Texas) is a drummer who has been performing for more than 35 years.

He then studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University in 1949. Turner established the studio pottery program at Black Mountain College in North Carolina between 1949 and 1951. Later he returned to Alfred Station, establishing himself as a studio potter. In 1958, he joined the Alfred University faculty, where he remained until his retirement as Professor Emeritus of Ceramic Art in 1979. Like many studio potters, Turner began his career producing functional ceramics. During the late 1960s, Turner turned to nonfunctional explorations of the vessel tradition. His many honors include an honorary doctorate in fine art from Swarthmore, the American Craft Council Gold medal, and the Member of Honor of the International Academy of Ceramics. The Milwaukee Art Museum organized a retrospective of his ceramics career, which toured from 1985 to 1987. Turner was also honored by the establishment of the Robert C.

P. Lovecraft, written in June 1917 and first published in the March 1922 issue of The Vagrant. It tells the story of Jervas Dudley, who becomes obsessed with a mausoleum near his childhood home. Plot \\"The Tomb\\" tells of Jervas Dudley, a confessed daydreamer. While still a child, he discovers the padlocked entrance to a mausoleum belonging to the Hyde family, whose nearby mansion had burnt down many years previously. Jervas attempts to break the padlock, but is unable to. Dispirited, he takes to sleeping beside the tomb. Eventually, inspired by reading Plutarch's Lives, Dudley decides to patiently wait until it is his time to gain entrance to the tomb. One night, several years later, Jervas falls asleep once more beside the mausoleum. He awakes suddenly in the late afternoon, and fancies that as he awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished inside the tomb. Jervas then returns to his home, where he goes directly to the attic, to a rotten chest, and therein finds the key to the tomb. Once inside the tomb, Jervas discovers an empty coffin with the name \\"Jervas\\" inscribed upon the plate. He begins to sleep in the empty coffin each night, yet those who witness him sleeping see him asleep outside the tomb, not inside as Jervas believes. Jervas also develops a fear of thunder and fire, and is aware that he is being spied upon by one of his neighbours. Against his better judgement, Jervas sets out for the tomb at night, with a storm looming. He sees the Hyde mansion restored to its former state; there is a party in progress, which he joins, abandoning his former quietude for blasphemous hedonism. During the party, lightning strikes the mansion, and it burns. Jervas loses consciousness, having imagined himself being burnt to ashes in the blaze. He next finds himself screaming and struggling, being held by two men with his father in attendance. A small antique box is discovered, having been unearthed by the recent storm. Inside is a porcelain miniature of a man, with the initials \\"J.H.\\" Jervas fancies its face to be the mirror image of his own. It seems that Jervas was the reincarnation of Jervas Hyde, who came back to be laid with his ancestors in the family tomb, as he was not when his ashes blew away in all directions. Jervas begins jabbering that he has been sleeping inside the tomb. His father, saddened by his son's mental instability, tells him that he has been watched for some time and has never gone inside the tomb, and indeed, the padlock is rusted with age. Jervas is removed to an asylum, presumed mad. He asks his servant Hiram, who has remained faithful to him despite his current state, to explore the tomb ‚Äì a request which Hiram fulfills. After breaking the padlock and descending with a lantern into the murky depths, Hiram returns to his master and informs him that there is, indeed, a coffin with a plate which reads \\"Jervas\\" on it. Jervas then states that he has been promised burial in that coffin when he dies.

These Amish moved away from the old Amish traditions and drew near to the Mennonites, becoming Mennonites of Amish origin. Over the decades, most Amish Mennonites groups removed the word \\"Amish\\" from the name of their congregations or merged with Mennonite groups. In the latest decades the term \\"Amish Mennonite\\" is sometimes erroneously used to designate horse and buggy Old Order Mennonites, whose lifestyle is more or less similar to the Old Order Amish. Sometimes the term \\"Amish Mennonite\\" is used to designate all groups of Amish, both the Old Order Amish and the Amish Mennonites and also the Amish before this division in the second half of the 19th century. The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online uses the term \\"Amish Mennonite\\" in this sense.Amish Mennonite at gameo.org.  History = Division 1850‚Äì1878  Most Amish communities that were established in North America did not ultimately retain their Amish identity. The major division that resulted in the loss of identity of many Amish congregations occurred in the third quarter of the 19th century. The forming of factions worked its way out at different times at different places. The process was rather a \\"sorting out\\" than a split. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation at another place that fits them best. Between 1862 and 1878 yearly Dienerversammlungen (ministerial conferences) were held at different places, concerning how the Amish should deal with the pressures of modern society.Steven M. Nolt: A History of the Amish, Intercourse, 1992, page 159. The meetings themselves were a progressive idea; for bishops to assemble to discuss uniformity was an unprecedented notion in the Amish church. By the first several meetings, the more traditionally minded bishops agreed to boycott the conferences. The more progressive members, comprising approximately two-thirds of the group, became known by the name Amish Mennonite, and eventually united with the Mennonite Church, and other Mennonite denominations, mostly in the early 20th century. The more traditionally minded groups became known as the Old Order Amish.Steven M. Nolt: A History of the Amish, Intercourse, 1992, pages 157-178. The Egli Amish had already started to withdraw from the Amish church in 1858. They soon drifted away from the old ways and changed their name to \\"Defenseless Mennonite\\" in 1908.http://fecministries.org/our-beliefs/history/ Fellowship of Evangelical Churches: Our History. Congregations that took no side in the division after 1862 formed the Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference in 1910 but dropped the word \\"Amish\\" from their name in 1957.Stephen Scott: An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups, Intercourse, Pennsylvania, 1996, pages 122-123. Because there was no division in Europe, the Amish congregations remaining there took the same way as the change-minded Amish Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the Mennonites. The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the Ixheim Amish congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in Alsace, are descended directly from former Amish congregations.Steven M. Nolt: A History of the Amish, Intercourse, 1992, page 227. Early conferences The Amish Mennonites formed regional conferences in the late 1880s after the division. During the early 20th century, most of these original Amish Mennonite groups merged with regional Mennonite conferences and lost their Amish identity.Daniel Lehman: The American Mennonites: Tracing the Development of the (Old) Mennonite Church, Ephrata, PA, 1998. *The Indiana-Michigan Amish Mennonite Conference, organized in 1888 and merged with the Indiana-Michigan Mennonite Conference in 1916. *The Western District Amish Mennonite Conference, organized in 1890 and merged with the Western Mennonite Conferences in 1920-1921. *The Eastern Amish Mennonite Conference, organized in 1893 and merged with the Ohio Mennonite Conference in 1927.Amish-Mennonites and Other Plain Anabaptists at beachyam.org. *The Ontario Amish Mennonite Conference, organized in 1925, assimilated into the Mennonite mainstream in the 1950s and early 1960s and changed their name to Western Ontario Mennonite Conference in 1963.Western Ontario Mennonite Conference at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online *The Stuckey Amish (Mennonites) of Illinois, emerged from a split in 1872, organized as a conference in 1899 and joined the General Conference Mennonite Church as a district conference in 1945. In 1957 it merged with the Middle District Conference to form the Central District of the General Conference Mennonite Church.Central Conference Mennonite Church at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. *The Egli Amish, also known as the √âgly Amish, were organized in 1865‚Äì1866 and changed their name to Defenseless Mennonite Church in 1908. They adopted the name Evangelical Mennonite Church in 1949 and became mainstream. While Evangelical Mennonite Churches currently exist, in 2003, a broader group of Mennonites became the Fellowship of Evangelical Churches. Later conferences The \\"Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference\\" was born several decades after the original Amish Mennonite movement. In 1910, leaders from three unaffiliated Amish Mennonite congregations met in Michigan to discuss the formation of a conference that allowed for congregational autonomy yet would be able to assist individual churches with problems. This conference was to be more conservative than the aforementioned Amish Mennonite conferences. Nonetheless it moved closer to mainstream Mennonite groups, eventually losing its Amish identity. In 1954, a majority vote called for the removal of the \\"Amish\\" part of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference (CMC) name, which was implemented in the 1957 constitution revision. Proponents suggested that \\"Amish Mennonite\\" conferences were obsolete. During the 1960s, concern rose among some about the lax practice on issues such as the women‚Äôs head veiling and cut hair, television, and clothing items. Individual churches began to differ greatly in practice. Since the concerns in the 1960s, conference has abandoned a stand on the aforementioned practices Ivan J. Miller: History of the Conservative Mennonite Conference 1910-1985, Grantsville, MD, 1985. Leading the process of assimilation further the \\"Ohio Mennonite and Eastern Amish Mennonite Joint Conference\\" became the \\"Ohio and Eastern Mennonite Conference\\" in 1955 and the \\"Ontario Amish Mennonite Conference\\" became the \\"Western Ontario Mennonite Conference\\" in 1963.Steven Nolt: A History of the Amish, Third Edition, Intercourse, PA, 2016. Kauffman Amish Mennonite The Kauffman Amish Mennonites, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches or Tampico Amish Mennonite Churches, are a Plain branch of the Amish Mennonites whose tradition goes back to John D. Kauffman (1847-1913) who preached while being in trance. In 2017 they had some 2,000 baptized members and lived mainly in Missouri and Arkansas. In contrast to other Amish Mennonites they have largely retained the Pennsylvania German language and other traditions from the late 1800s. They allow some modern conveniences, such as electricity and cars. The Kauffman Amish Mennonite congregations are one of a few groups that clearly identifies itself as an Amish Mennonite constituency.Sleeping Preacher Churches at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. Beachy Amish Mennonites The largest and most dominant contemporary Amish Mennonite group are the Beachy Amish Mennonites. The Beachy Amish received their name from Moses M. Beachy, a former Old Order Amish bishop in Somerset County, PA. Beachy refused to administer a strict form of shunning against members whose only offense was transferring membership to the nearby Conservative Amish Mennonite congregation. Half of the congregation sided with Beachy, and the other half sided with co-ministers Yoder and Yoder. Beachy's congregation affiliated with a similar Amish Mennonite congregation in Lancaster County, today known as the Weavertown Amish Mennonite Church. During the 1940s, a number of other factions emerged in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Virginia from Old Order Amish groups. The congregations sought affiliation with the Beachy constituency. Today, the Beachy Amish vary widely in practice, as the constituency is a fellowship with congregational autonomy separate of a governing conference. Most have retained conservative, plain practices, but this is becoming increasingly questioned, especially in more mainstream churches in predominantly Old Order Amish areas, though not exclusively confined to these regions. New standard allowances in the more mainstream congregations include the radio and DVD or video watching. Clothing is also less distinct in these congregations, especially among the men; however, women's dress has become less distinguishable with a tighter fit and the wearing of sweaters or jackets, and coverings undergone abbreviation. However, the most conservative of Beachy congregations use German in services, refuse to have their photograph taken, and dress similar to the New Order Amish. Between these two range points is a wide variety of practice. Mennonite Christian Fellowship The Mennonite Christian Fellowship churches, also known as the \\"Fellowship churches\\", originated from several congregations separating from the Old Order Amish in the 1950s and 1960s. The congregations resembled the more conservative end of the Beachy Amish Mennonite constituency at that time. The two groups shared fellowship to the extent that these churches were incorporated into the Beachy affiliation. In 1977, however, some of the ordained men in these churches expressed concern about perceived worldly trends among the Beachy Amish. They met with other ordained Beachy Amish men. Some concerns included members baptized without a true Christian conversion, worldly fads in clothing and lifestyle, and churches conglomerating in communities instead of spreading out. After this meeting, the concerned men decided to withdraw from the Beachy Amish church fellowship, and organize the Mennonite Christian Fellowship. In 1978, these churches started holding their own annual Minister‚Äôs Meetings. They operate their own Christian day schools and use Sunday School materials printed by Rod and Staff Publishers of Crockett, Kentucky. They have sponsored missions in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Paraguay.Allan Miller (ed.): The Origin of the Fellowship Churches, Renick, WV, 2004. In 2006, the Fellowship churches had 1,518 members in 34 congregations.Mennonite Church Directory 2007. Other congregations A number of other Amish Mennonite congregations exist in an independent, unaffiliated setting. Most identify themselves in name as Conservative Mennonites or conservative Amish Mennonite and may hold fellowship with various Beachy or conservative Mennonite congregations. Two newer affiliated groups include Berea Amish Mennonite Churches and Ambassador Amish Mennonite Churches. There is also a small group of Old Beachy Amish congregations which still use the German Language.See Mennonite Church Directory 2009 Membership and congregations Around the year 2000 there were 13 Amish Mennonite congregations in five states of the USA. Membership of these congregations was 1,222. There were also 16 unaffiliated Amish Mennonite congregations in nine states with 737 members.Donald B. Kraybill and C.

The festival was promoted by Angel Music Group, previously known as Godskitchen (which completed a restructuring and rebranding programme in 2005), to reflect their wide range of music- related interests, although the Godskitchen Arena was the centrepiece of the festival's line up. Other arena hosts included Essential Selection, Air, Polysexual, Bedrock, Carl Cox & Friends, Strongbow Ciderhouse, and others. The outdoor beach stage also returned for the event, and it was covered by BBC Radio 1. Acts included, Daft Punk, and Groove Armada, among many others. Radio 1 also broadcast 4-hour extended Essential Mix, which featured Fatboy Slim, Deep Dish, DJ Ti√´sto, and Ferry Corsten. Global Gathering took place for the first time in the United States on 18 March 2006 in Miami, at the city-owned Bicentennial Park alongside Biscayne Bay. This event marked the first time that the festival has gone across the Atlantic. Angel Music Group, parent company of Godskitchen, partnered up with United States-based companies Track Entertainment, (which acquired AMG on 5 June 2006), Bacardi and Club Space, to produce and promote the event. Acts included Sasha and John Digweed, Deep Dish, Roger Sanchez, Adam Freeland, Murk, and rock acts such as Nine Inch Nails, Rob Zombie, Lacuna Coil, Avenged Sevenfold, Shinedown, and more. Although Tommy Lee was supposed to headline he did not show up. With the success of the Miami event, Bacardi Global Gathering did a second Stateside festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Labor Day Weekend in September 2006. Performers included Ti√´sto, Papa Roach, Uncle Kracker, and more. The event took place at The Palms resort in Las Vegas over the course of the holiday weekend. Angel Music Group presented HI-FI (EIRE), which took place over the 4‚Äì5 August in the grounds of Belvedere House and Gardens, Co.Westmeath. This festival follows in the successful footprints of Global Gathering Ireland from 2005. For the 2007 year, the festival will be taking a brief hiatus from the United States. However, the original UK festival is already being planned, and presale tickets are being sold.

The park covers an area of , with territory distributed by the administrative regions of Brazl√¢ndia, Bras√≠lia and Sobradinho, in the Federal District and by the municipality of Padre Bernardo, in Goi√°s. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is the largest park in an urbanized area in the world. History The creation of the park, on November 29, 1961, was under Federal Decree of Brazil covering an area of (initially was proposed) extending over an elevation range of . It is under IUCN Category II. It is directly related to the development of Brasilia. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the park was protected to provide forested area around the national capital of Brazil. In 1994, seventy percent of the park burned. Geography Reservoir within the park The park is in the northwest of the Federal District in the center-west region of Brazil. Its boundaries have been fixed and also fenced. The park is divided into Intangible, Primitive, Extensive, Intensive, Special and Recuperation zones from the development perspective. The terrain is an undulating plateau with geological formations of quartzites and limestones. It has many caves and several springs. Apart from the springs, the source of water supply to the park is also through a reservoir. The most prominent features of the park are the pools formed from water wells. Several creeks flow through the park, including the Bananal, Torto, and Santa Maria Creeks. Because of the large number of springs, its nickname is Agua Mineral (mineral water); the water is reported to have healing properties. There are many trekking trails through the park. Climate The climate of the region, according to the K√∂ppen classification, is \\"tropical savanna\\". The rainy season begins in October and ends in April, representing 84% of the annual total. The wettest quarter is from November to January, and December is the month with the highest rainfall of the year. The dry season is from May to September, and in the driest quarter is June, July, and August, when precipitation represents only 2% of the annual total. In terms of total annual average rainfall, Federal District varies between . The park itself has an average annual rainfall incidence of . Average annual temperature reported is . Eastern winds are dominant in the park. Flora Cerrado forests in the park Cerrado or upland savanna trees, the dominant vegetation in the central regions of Brazil, form the core area of this park. However, the vegetation around the springs and streams are of Campo Cerrado type, which consists of gallery forests. These areas fall under the biosphere reserve declared by UNESCO. The plant species reported from the park are buriti palm and many species of the Velloziaceae (a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants. The park has established a forest tree nursery and also runs a centre for environmental education. Fauna The faunal species reported from the park are: maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), giant armadillo (Priodontes giganteus), black howler monkey (Alouatta caraya), forest rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), Juscelinomys candangus, cavy (Galea spixii), Calhartes burrovianus urubutinga, Mussurana (Portuguese mu√ßurana) and tegu (Tupinambis teguixin).

Kosovo, a disputed province of Serbia under international administration that in 2008 unilaterally declared independence and received partial recognition, still not having a final status, was not able to commence with SAP. To ensure that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) follow EU-compatible practices in the political, economic and sectoral reform process, UNMIK and the European Commission agreed that an instrument was needed to monitor and drive the process. Although developments within Kosovo are not only a matter of reform, it was deemed profitable for the PISG and UNMIK to follow the methodology and substance of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) and thus avoid isolation from the mainstream of European integration. To that end, on 6 November 2002, the European Commission commenced the so-called Stabilisation and Association Process Tracking Mechanism (STM). The STM constitutes a parallel track to the EU's regular SAP and is intended to help the authorities in Kosovo to prepare for reinforced policy-making relations within the framework of the EU's Stabilisation and Association process. It will ensure that Kosovo is not isolated from the path of EU-compatible transition and development of Southeast Europe. The process aims at building an institutional, legislative, economic and social framework directed by the values and models subscribed to by the EU, as well as at promoting the transition to a market economy. 15 STM meetings have taken place, the latest in December 2008. The 6th STM meeting was held on 16 February 2005 in Pri≈°tina. It was the first meeting with the newly elected government. For the first time, specific sector workshops on energy and economy were organised on the margin of the STM main meeting. The 7th STM meeting took place on 3 May 2005 in Pri≈°tina. Focus of the meeting was on the progress made on the Kosovo Action Plan for the Implementation of the European Partnership. Everybody considered the improvement of Kosovo's economic situation as being crucial for its development. Further emphasis was put on the significance of Kosovo's further regional integration, not solely as a means to enhance economic development, but also as an important contribution towards peace and stability throughout the region. In June 2005 the Second Progress Report on the Kosovo Action Plan for the Implementation of the European Partnership was submitted to the European Commission as input to the Commission's SAP Report. The next STM meeting is scheduled for October 2005. In 2008 the Commission confirmed that it would conduct a \\"feasibility study.\\" A feasibility study is traditionally the first step in the Stabilisation and Association Process, the tool the EU uses to help prepare potential candidates in the Western Balkans for membership of the EU.

The clade arose from haplogroup R, likely during the early Upper Paleolithic. Its various subclades (labelled U1-U9, diverging over the course of the Upper Paleolithic) are found widely distributed across Northern and Eastern Europe, Central, Western and South Asia, as well as North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Canary Islands. Origins Haplogroup U descends from the haplogroup R mtDNA branch of the phylogenetic tree. The defining mutations (A11467G, A12308G, G12372A) are estimated to have arisen between 43,000 and 50,000 years ago, in the early Upper Paleolithic (around 46,530 ¬± 3,290 years before present, with a 95% confidence interval per Behar et al., 2012). Ancient DNA classified as belonging to the U* mitochondrial haplogroup has been recovered from human skeletal remains found in Western Siberia, which have been dated to c. 45,000 years ago. The mitogenome (33-fold coverage) of the Pe≈ütera Muierii 1 individual (PM1) from Romania (35 ky cal BP) has been identified as the basal haplogroup U6* not previously found in any ancient or present-day humans.. Haplogroup U has been found among Iberomaurusian specimens dating from the Epipaleolithic at the Taforalt and Afalou prehistoric sites. Among the Taforalt individuals, around 13% of the observed haplotypes belonged to various U subclades, including U4a2b (1/24; 4%), U4c1 (1/24; 4%), and U6d3 (1/24; 4%). A further 41% of the analysed haplotypes could be assigned to either haplogroup U or haplogroup H. Among the Afalou individuals, 44% of the analysed haplotypes could be assigned to either haplogroup U or haplogroup H (3/9; 33%). Haplogroup U has also been observed among ancient Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, dated to the 1st millennium BC. Additionally, haplogroup U has been observed in ancient Guanche fossils excavated in Gran Canaria and Tenerife on the Canary Islands, which have been radiocarbon-dated to between the 7th and 11th centuries CE. All of the clade-bearing individuals were inhumed at the Tenerife site, with these specimens found to belong to the U6b1a (4/7; 57%) and U6b (1/7; 14%) subclades. Distribution Haplogroup U is found in 15% of Indian caste and 8% of Indian tribal populations. Haplogroup U is found in approximately 11% of native Europeans and is held as the oldest maternal haplogroup found in that region. In a 2013 study, all but one of the ancient modern human sequences from Europe belonged to maternal haplogroup U, thus confirming previous findings that haplogroup U was the dominant type of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in Europe before the spread of agriculture into Europe and the presence and the spread of the Indo-Europeans in Western Europe. Haplogroup U has various subclades numbered U1 to U9. Haplogroup K is a subclade of U8. The old age has led to a wide distribution of the descendant subgroups across Western Eurasia, North Africa, and South Asia. Some subclades of haplogroup U have a more specific geographic range. Subclades Subclades are labelled U1-U9; Haplogroup K is a subclade of U8. Van Oven and Kayser (2009) proposed subclades \\"U2'3'4'7'8\\" and \\"U4'9\\". Behar et al. (2012) amended this by grouping \\"U4'9\\" as subordinate to \\"U2'3'4'7'8\\" for a new intermediate subclade \\"U2'3'4'7'8'9\\". Haplogroup U Basal U was found in the 26,000 years old remains of Ancient North Eurasian, Mal'ta boy (MA1). Haplogroup U1 The U1 subclades are: U1a (with deep-subclades U1a1, U1a1a, U1a1a1, U1a1b) and U1b. Haplogroup U1 estimated to have arisen between 26,000 and 37,000 years ago. It is found at very low frequency throughout Europe. It is more often observed in eastern Europe, Anatolia and the Near East. It is also found at low frequencies in India. U1 is found in the Svanetia region of Georgia at 4.2%. Subclade U1a is found from India to Europe, but is extremely rare among the northern and Atlantic fringes of Europe including the British Isles and Scandinavia. Several examples in Tuscany have been noted. In India, U1a has been found in the Kerala region. U1b has a similar spread but is rarer than U1a. Some examples of U1b have been found among Jewish diaspora. Subclades U1a and U1b appear in equal frequency in eastern Europe. The rare U1 clade is also found among Algerians in Oran (0.83%-1.08%) and the Reguibat tribe of the Sahrawi (0.93%). The U1a1a subclade has been observed in an ancient individual excavated at the Kellis 2 cemetery in the Dakleh Oasis, located in the southwestern desert of Egypt. 21 of the Kellis burials have been radiocarbon- dated to around 80-445 AD, a timeframe within the Romano-Christian period. Haplogroup U1 has also been found among specimens at the mainland cemetery in Kulubnarti, Sudan, which date from the Early Christian period (AD 550-800). DNA analysis of excavated remains now located at ruins of the Church of St. Augustine in Goa, India have also revealed the unique mtDNA subclade U1b. This sublineage is absent in India, but present in Georgia and surrounding regions. Since the genetic analysis corroborates archaeological and literary evidence, it is believed that the excavated remains belong to Ketevan the Martyr, queen of Georgia. Haplogroup U5 The age of U5 is estimated at between 25,000 and 35,000 years old, roughly corresponding to the Gravettian culture. Approximately 11% of Europeans (10% of European-Americans) have some variant of haplogroup U5. U5 was the predominant mtDNA of mesolithic Western Hunter Gatherers (WHG). U5 has been found in human remains dating from the Mesolithic in England, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, France and Spain. Neolithic skeletons (~7,000 years old) that were excavated from the Avellaner cave in Catalonia, northeastern Spain included a specimen carrying haplogroup U5. Haplogroup U5 and its subclades U5a and U5b today form the highest population concentrations in the far north, among Sami, Finns, and Estonians. However, it is spread widely at lower levels throughout Europe. This distribution, and the age of the haplogroup, indicate individuals belonging to this clade were part of the initial expansion tracking the retreat of ice sheets from Europe around 10,000 years ago. The modern Basques and Cantabrians possess almost exclusively U5b lineages (U5b1f, U5b1c1, U5b2). Additionally, haplogroup U5 is found in small frequencies and at much lower diversity in the Near East and parts of northern Africa (areas with sizable U6 concentrations), suggesting back-migration of people from Europe toward the south.

Haplogroup U6 Projected frequencies for haplogroup U6 (top left) and several subclades. Haplogroup U6 was dated to between 31,000 and 43,000 years ago by Behar et al. (2012). Basal U6* was found in a Romanian specimen of ancient DNA (Pe»ôtera Muierilor) dated to 35,000 years ago. Hervella et al. (2016) take this find as evidence for Paleolithic back-migration of Homo sapiens from Eurasia into Africa. The discovery of basal U6* in ancient DNA contributed to setting back the estimated age of U6 to around 46,000 years ago. \\"Individuals carrying haplogroup U possibly spread westward from Western Asia around 39‚Äì52 ky, reaching Europe as signaled by haplogroup U5, and North Africa signaled by haplogroup U6, which likely represents a genetic signal of a EUP return of Homo sapiens from Eurasia to North Africa. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for U6 was estimated to 35.3 (24.6‚Äì46.4) ky BP. [...] Our estimates of the haplogroup U6 TMRCA that incorporate ancient genomes (including PM1) set the formation of the U6 lineage back to 49.6 ky BP (95% HPD: 42‚Äì58 ky)\\" Haplogroup U6 is common (with a prevalence of around 10%) in Northwest Africa (with a maximum of 29% in an Algerian Mozabites) and the Canary Islands (18% on average with a peak frequency of 50.1% in La Gomera). It is also found in the Iberian peninsula, where it has the highest diversity (10 out of 19 sublineages are only found in this region and not in Africa), Northeast Africa and occasionally in other locations. U6 is also found at low frequencies in the Chad Basin, including the rare Canarian branch. This suggests that the ancient U6 clade bearers may have inhabited or passed through the Chad Basin on their way westward toward the Canary Islands. U6 is thought to have entered North Africa from the Near East around 30,000 years ago. It has been found among Iberomaurusian specimens dating from the Epipaleolithic at the Taforalt prehistoric site. In spite of the highest diversity of Iberian U6, Maca-Meyer argues for a Near East origin of this clade based on the highest diversity of subclade U6a in that region, where it would have arrived from West Asia, with the Iberian incidence primarily representing migration from the Maghreb and not persistence of a European root population. According to Hern√°ndez et al. 2015 \\"the estimated entrance of the North African U6 lineages into Iberia at 10 ky correlates well with other L African clades, indicating that U6 and some L lineages moved together from Africa to Iberia in the Early Holocene.\\" U6 has four main subclades: * U6a: subclade is the most widespread, stretching from the Canary Islands and Iberian Peninsula to the Horn of Africa and Near East. The subhaplogroup has its highest diversity in Northeast Africa. Ancient DNA analysis of Iberomaurusian skeletal remains at the Taforalt site in Morocco, which have been dated to the Later Stone Age between 15,100 and 13,900 ybp, observed the U6a subclade among most of the fossils (6/7; ~86%). Fossils at the Early Neolithic site of Ifri n'Amr or Moussa in Morocco, which have been dated to around 5,000 BCE, have also been found to carry the U6a subhaplogroup. These ancient individuals bore an autochthonous Northwest African genomic component that peaks among modern Berbers, indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. U6a's estimated age is 24-27,500 BP. It has one major subclade: ** U6a1: similar distribution to U6a parent clade; found particularly among Copts (27.6%) and Beja (10.4%). Estimated age: 15-20,000 BP. * U6b: shows a more patched and western distribution. In the Iberian peninsula, U6b is more frequent in the north, whereas U6a is more common in the south. It has also been found at low frequencies in Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and Nigeria. Estimated age: 8,500-24,500 BP. It has one subclade: ** U6b1: found only in the Canary Islands and in the Iberian peninsula. Estimated age: c. 6000 BP. * U6c: only found in Morocco and Canary Islands. Estimated age: 6,000-17,500 BP. * U6d: most closely related to U6b. Localized in the Maghreb, with a presence in Europe. It arose between 10,000 and 13,000 BP. U6a, U6b and U6d share a common basal mutation (16219) that is not present in U6c, whereas U6c has 11 unique mutations. U6b and U6d share a mutation (16311) not shared by U6a, which has three unique mutations.  U2'3'4'7'8'9  Subclades U2, U3, U4, U7, U8 and U9 are now thought to be monophyletic, its common ancestor \\"U2'3'4'7'8'9\\" defined by mutation A1811G, arising between about 42,000 and 48,000 years ago (Behar et al., 2012). Within U2'3'4'7'8'9, U4 and U9 may be monophyletic, as \\"U4'9\\" (mutations T195C!, G499A, T5999C) arising between 31,000 and 43,000 years ago (Behar et al., 2012). U2'3'4'7'8'9 was found in the remains of two 32,000 years old Ancient North Siberians (ANS) from the Yana RHS Site on river Yana. =Haplogroup U2= Haplogroup U2 is most common in South Asia but is also found in low frequency in Central and West Asia, as well as in Europe as U2e (the European variety of U2 is named U2e). The overall frequency of U2 in South Asia is largely accounted for by the group U2i in India whereas haplogroup U2e, common in Europe, is rare; given that these lineages diverged approximately 50,000-years-ago, these data have been interpreted as indicating very low maternal-line gene-flow between South Asia and Europe throughout this period. Approximately one half of the U mtDNAs in India belong to the Indian-specific branches of haplogroup U2 (U2i: U2a, U2b and U2c). While U2 is typically found in India, it is also present in the Nogais, descendants of various Mongolic and Turkic tribes, who formed the Nogai Horde. Both U2 and U4 are found in the Ket and Nganasan peoples, the indigenous inhabitants of the Yenisei River basin and the Taymyr Peninsula. The U2 subclades are: U2a, U2b, U2c, U2d, and U2e. With the India-specific subclades U2a, U2b, and U2c collectively referred to as U2i, the Eurasian haplogroup U2d appears to be a sister clade with the Indian haplogroup U2c, while U2e is considered a European-specific subclade but also found in South India. Haplogroup U2 has been found in the remains of a 37,000 and 30,000-year-old hunter-gatherer from the Kostyonki, Voronezh Oblast in Central-South European Russia., in 4800 to 4000-year-old human remains from a Beaker culture site of the Late Neolithic in Kromsdorf Germany, and in 2,000-year-old human remains from B√∏gebjergg√•rd in Southern Denmark. However, haplogroup U2 is rare in present-day Scandinavians. The remains of a 2,000-year-old West Eurasian male of haplogroup U2e1 was found in the Xiongnu Cemetery of Northeast Mongolia. =Haplogroup U3= Haplogroup U3 falls into two subclades:: U3a and U3b. Coalescence age for U3a is estimated as 18,000 to 26,000-years-ago while the coalescence age for U3b is estimated as 18,000 to 24,000-years-ago. U3a is found in Europe, the Near East, the Caucasus and North Africa. The almost-entirely European distributed subclade, U3a1, dated at 4000 to 7000-years-ago, suggests a relatively recent (late Holocene or later) expansion of these lineages in Europe. There is a minor U3c subclade (derived from U3a), represented by a single Azeri mtDNA from the Caucasus. U3b is widespread across the Middle East and the Caucasus, and it is found especially in Iran, Iraq and Yemen, with a minor European subclade, U3b1b, dated at 2000 to 3000-years-ago. Haplogroup U3 is defined by the HVR1 transition A16343G. It is found at low levels throughout Europe (about 1% of the population), the Near East (about 2.5% of the population), and Central Asia (about 1% of the population). U3 is present in the Svan population from the Svaneti region (about 4.2% of the population) and among Lithuanian Romani, Polish Romani, and Spanish Romani populations (36-56%) consistent with a common migration route from India then out-of-the Balkans for the Lithuanian, Polish, and Spanish Roma. The U3 clade is also found among Mozabite Berbers (10.59%), as well as Egyptians in the El-Hayez (2.9%) and Gurna oases (2.9%), and Algerians in Oran (1.08%-1.25%). The rare U3a subclade occurs among the Tuareg inhabiting Niger (3.23%). Haplogroup U3 has been found in some of the 6400-year-old remains (U3a) discovered in the caves at Wadi El‚ÄêMakkukh near Jericho associated with the Chalcolithic period. Haplogroup U3 was already present in the West Eurasian gene pool around 6,000-years-ago and probably also its subclade U3a as well. =Haplogroup U4= Haplogroup U4 has its origin between 21,000 and 14,000 years ago. Its distribution is associated with the population bottleneck due to the Last Glacial Maximum. U4 has been found in ancient DNA, and it is relatively rare in modern populations, although it is found in substantial ratios in certain indigenous populations of Northern Asia and Northern Europe, being associated with the remnants of ancient European hunting-gatherers preserved in the indigenous populations of Siberia. U4 is found in the Nganasan people of the Taymyr Peninsula, in the Mansi (16.3%) an endangered people, and in the Ket people (28.9%) of the Yenisei River. It is found in Europe with highest concentrations in Scandinavia and the Baltic states. and is found in the Sami population of the Scandinavian peninsula (although, U5b has a higher representation). U4 is also preserved in the Kalash people (current population size 3,700) a unique tribe among the Indo-Aryan peoples of Pakistan where U4 (subclade U4a1) attains its highest frequency of 34%. The U4 subclades are: U4a, U4b, U4c, and U4d. Haplogroup U4 is associated with ancient European hunter-gatherers and has been found in 7,200 to 6,000-year-old remains of the Pitted Ware culture in Gotland Sweden and in 4,400 to 3,800-year-old remains from the Damsbo site of the Danish Beaker culture. Remains identified as subclade U4a2 are associated with the Corded Ware culture, which flourished 5200 to 4300 years ago in Eastern and Central Europe and encompassed most of continental northern Europe from the Volga River in the east to the Rhine in the west. Mitochondrial DNA recovered from 3,500 to 3,300-year-old remains at the Bredtofteg√•rd site in Denmark associated with the Nordic Bronze Age include haplogroup U4 with 16179T in its HVR1 indicative of subclade U4c1. =Haplogroup U7= Haplogroup U7 is considered a West Eurasian-specific mtDNA haplogroup, believed to have originated in the Black Sea area approximately 30,000-years- ago. In modern populations, U7 occurs at low frequency in the Caucasus, the western Siberian tribes, West Asia (about 4% in the Near East, while peaking with 10% in Iranians), South Asia (about 12% in Gujarat, the westernmost state of India, while for the whole of India its frequency stays around 2%, and 5% in Pakistan), and the Vedda people of Sri Lanka where it reaches it highest frequency of 13.33% (subclade U7a). One third of the West Eurasian-specific mtDNAs found in India are in haplogroups U7, R2 and W. It is speculated that large-scale immigration carried these mitochondrial haplogroups into India. The U7 subclades are: U7a (with deep-subclades U7a1, U7a2, U7a2a, U7a2b) and U7b. Genetic analysis of individuals associated with the Late Hallstatt culture from Baden-W√ºrttemberg Germany considered to be examples of Iron Age \\"princely burials\\" included haplogroup U7. Haplogroup U7 was reported to have been found in 1200-year-old human remains (dating to around 834), in a woman believed to be from a royal clan who was buried with the Viking Oseberg Ship in Norway. Haplogroup U7 was found in 1000-year-old human remains (dating to around AD 1000-1250) in a Christian cemetery is Kongemarken Denmark. However, U7 is rare among present-day ethnic Scandinavians. The U7a subclade is especially common among Saudis, constituting around 30% of maternal lineages in the Eastern Province. =Haplogroup U8= *Haplogroup U8a: The Basques have the most ancestral phylogeny in Europe for the mitochondrial haplogroup U8a. This is a rare subgroup of U8, placing the Basque origin of this lineage in the Upper Palaeolithic. The lack of U8a lineages in Africa suggests that their ancestors may have originated from West Asia. *Haplogroup U8b: This clade has been found in Italy and Jordan. **Haplogroup U8b'K: This clade may be synonymous with Haplogroup K and Haplogroup UK. The haplogroup U8b's most common subclade is haplogroup K, which is estimated to date to between 30,000 and 22,000 years ago. Haplogroup K makes up a sizeable fraction of European and West Asian mtDNA lineages. It is now known it is actually a subclade of haplogroup U8b'K, and is believed to have first arisen in northeastern Italy. Haplogroup UK shows some evidence of being highly protective against AIDS progression. =Haplogroup U9= Haplogroup U9 is a rare clade in mtDNA phylogeny, characterized only recently in a few populations of Pakistan (Quintana-Murci et al. 2004). Its presence in Ethiopia and Yemen, together with some Indian-specific M lineages in the Yemeni sample, points to gene flow along the coast of the Arabian Sea. Haplogroups U9 and U4 share two common mutations at the root of their phylogeny. It is interesting that, in Pakistan, U9 occurs frequently only among the so-called Makrani population. In this particular population, lineages specific to parts of Eastern Africa occur as frequently as 39%, which suggests that U9 lineages in Pakistan may have an African origin (Quintana-Murci et al. 2004). Regardless of which coast of the Arabian Sea may have been the origin of U9, its Ethiopian‚Äìsouthern Arabian‚ÄìIndus Basin distribution hints that the subclade's diversification from U4 may have occurred in regions far away from the current area of the highest diversity and frequency of haplogroup U4‚ÄîEast Europe and western Siberia.

In 1842, it was chartered as the Kentucky Institution for the Blind by the state legislature as the third state-supported school for the blind established in the United States. In 1855, it moved to its present location on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton neighborhood. About this time, it was renamed the Kentucky School for the Blind. Today, it continues its mission of teaching the blind and visually impaired students. The institution has inspired people to build other organizations to benefit those who are visually impaired. The school is a member of Council of Schools for the Blind (COSB).  Press  An ex-principal of the school has accused the Kentucky Board of Education of gender discrimination. The facility receives no basic school funding from the state government, and instead must \\"rely on money from the state‚Äôs general fund.\\" A previous student of the facility was recently nominated for a Grammy.

Any irregularities in their function lead to a range of developmental defects. These growth factors generally act as systemic or locally circulating molecules of extracellular origin that activate cell surface receptors. A defining property of FGFs is that they bind to heparin and heparan sulfate. Thus, some of them are found to be sequestered in the extracellular matrix of tissues that contains heparan sulfate proteoglycans and they are released locally upon injury or tissue remodeling. Families In humans, 22 members of the FGF family have been identified, all of which are structurally related signaling molecules: * Members FGF1 through FGF10 all bind fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). FGF1 is also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor, and FGF2 is also known as basic fibroblast growth factor. * Members FGF11, FGF12, FGF13, and FGF14, also known as FGF homologous factors 1-4 (FHF1-FHF4), have been shown to have distinct functions compared to the FGFs. Although these factors possess remarkably similar sequence homology, they do not bind FGFRs and are involved in intracellular processes unrelated to the FGFs. This group is also known as \\"iFGF\\". *Human FGF18 is involved in cell development and morphogenesis in various tissues including cartilage. * Human FGF20 was identified based on its homology to Xenopus FGF-20 (XFGF-20). * FGF15 through FGF23 were described later and functions are still being characterized. FGF15 is the mouse ortholog of human FGF19 (there is no human FGF15) and, where their functions are shared, they are often described as FGF15/19. In contrast to the local activity of the other FGFs, FGF15/19, FGF21 and FGF23 have hormonal systemic effects. Receptors The mammalian fibroblast growth factor receptor family has 4 members, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. The FGFRs consist of three extracellular immunoglobulin-type domains (D1-D3), a single-span trans- membrane domain and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. FGFs interact with the D2 and D3 domains, with the D3 interactions primarily responsible for ligand-binding specificity (see below). Heparan sulfate binding is mediated through the D3 domain. A short stretch of acidic amino acids located between the D1 and D2 domains has auto-inhibitory functions. This 'acid box' motif interacts with the heparan sulfate binding site to prevent receptor activation in the absence of FGFs. Alternate mRNA splicing gives rise to 'b' and 'c' variants of FGFRs 1, 2 and 3. Through this mechanism seven different signaling FGFR sub-types can be expressed at the cell surface. Each FGFR binds to a specific subset of the FGFs. Similarly most FGFs can bind to several different FGFR subtypes. FGF1 is sometimes referred to as the 'universal ligand' as it is capable of activating all 7 different FGFRs. In contrast, FGF7 (keratinocyte growth factor, KGF) binds only to FGFR2b (KGFR). The signaling complex at the cell surface is believed to be a ternary complex formed between two identical FGF ligands, two identical FGFR subunits, and either one or two heparan sulfate chains. History A mitogenic growth factor activity was found in pituitary extracts by Armelin in 1973 and further work by Gospodarowicz as reported in 1974 described a more defined isolation of proteins from cow brain extract which, when tested in a bioassay that caused fibroblasts to proliferate, led these investigators to apply the name \\"fibroblast growth factor.\\" In 1975, they further fractionated the extract using acidic and basic pH and isolated two slightly different forms that were named \\"acidic fibroblast growth factor\\" (FGF1) and \\"basic fibroblast growth factor\\" (FGF2). These proteins had a high degree of sequence homology among their amino acid chains, but were determined to be distinct proteins. Not long after FGF1 and FGF2 were isolated, another group of investigators isolated a pair of heparin-binding growth factors that they named HBGF-1 and HBGF-2, while a third group isolated a pair of growth factors that caused proliferation of cells in a bioassay containing blood vessel endothelium cells, which they called ECGF1 and ECGF2. These independently discovered proteins were eventually demonstrated to be the same sets of molecules, namely FGF1, HBGF-1 and ECGF-1 were all the same acidic fibroblast growth factor described by Gospodarowicz, et al., while FGF2, HBGF-2, and ECGF-2 were all the same basic fibroblast growth factor. Functions FGFs are multifunctional proteins with a wide variety of effects; they are most commonly mitogens but also have regulatory, morphological, and endocrine effects. They have been alternately referred to as \\"pluripotent\\" growth factors and as \\"promiscuous\\" growth factors due to their multiple actions on multiple cell types. Promiscuous refers to the biochemistry and pharmacology concept of how a variety of molecules can bind to and elicit a response from single receptor. In the case of FGF, four receptor subtypes can be activated by more than twenty different FGF ligands. Thus the functions of FGFs in developmental processes include mesoderm induction, anterior-posterior patterning, limb development, neural induction and neural development, and in mature tissues/systems angiogenesis, keratinocyte organization, and wound healing processes. FGF is critical during normal development of both vertebrates and invertebrates and any irregularities in their function leads to a range of developmental defects. FGFs secreted by hypoblasts during avian gastrulation play a role in stimulating a Wnt signaling pathway that is involved in the differential movement of Koller's sickle cells during formation of the primitive streak.Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology. 10th edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2014. Early Development in Birds. Print Left, angiography of the newly formed vascular network in the region of the front wall of the left ventricle. Right, analysis quantifying the angiogenic effect. While many FGFs can be secreted by cells to act on distant targets, some FGF act locally within a tissue, and even within a cell. Human FGF2 occurs in low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms. LMW FGF2 is primarily cytoplasmic and functions in an autocrine manner, whereas HMW FGF2s are nuclear and exert activities through an intracrine mechanism. One important function of FGF1 and FGF2 is the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and the physical organization of endothelial cells into tube-like structures. They thus promote angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature. FGF1 and FGF2 are more potent angiogenic factors than vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). FGF1 has been shown in clinical experimental studies to induce angiogenesis in the heart. As well as stimulating blood vessel growth, FGFs are important players in wound healing. FGF1 and FGF2 stimulate angiogenesis and the proliferation of fibroblasts that give rise to granulation tissue, which fills up a wound space/cavity early in the wound-healing process. FGF7 and FGF10 (also known as keratinocyte growth factors KGF and KGF2, respectively) stimulate the repair of injured skin and mucosal tissues by stimulating the proliferation, migration and differentiation of epithelial cells, and they have direct chemotactic effects on tissue remodeling. During the development of the central nervous system, FGFs play important roles in neural stem cell proliferation, neurogenesis, axon growth, and differentiation. FGF signaling is important in promoting surface area growth of the developing cerebral cortex by reducing neuronal differentiation and hence permitting the self-renewal of cortical progenitor cells, known as radial glial cells, and FGF2 has been used to induce artificial gyrification of the mouse brain. Another FGF family member, FGF8, regulates the size and positioning of the functional areas of the cerebral cortex (Brodmann areas). FGFs are also important for maintenance of the adult brain. Thus, FGFs are major determinants of neuronal survival both during development and during adulthood. Adult neurogenesis within the hippocampus e.g. depends greatly on FGF2. In addition, FGF1 and FGF2 seem to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and processes attributed to learning and memory, at least in the hippocampus. The 15 exparacrine FGFs are secreted proteins that bind heparan sulfate and can, therefore, be bound to the extracellular matrix of tissues that contain heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This local action of FGF proteins is classified as paracrine signalling, most commonly through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway or the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway. Members of the FGF19 subfamily (FGF15, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) bind less tightly to heparan sulfates, and so can act in an endocrine fashion on far-away tissues, such as intestine, liver, kidney, adipose, and bone. For example: * FGF15 and FGF19 (FGF15/19) are produced by intestinal cells but act on FGFR4-expressing liver cells to downregulate the key gene (CYP7A1) in the bile acid synthesis pathway. * FGF23 is produced by bone but acts on FGFR1-expressing kidney cells to regulate the synthesis of vitamin D and phosphate homeostasis. Structure The crystal structures of FGF1 have been solved and found to be related to interleukin 1-beta. Both families have the same beta trefoil fold consisting of 12-stranded beta-sheet structure, with the beta-sheets are arranged in 3 similar lobes around a central axis, 6 vbgn Fgggg 5*5* forming an anti-parallel beta-barrel. In general, the beta- sheets are well-preserved and the crystal structures superimpose in these areas. The intervening loops are less well-conserved - the loop between beta- strands 6 and 7 is slightly longer in interleukin-1 beta. Clinical applications Dysregulation of the FGF signalling system underlies a range of diseases associated with the increased FGF expression. Inhibitors of FGF signalling have shown clinical efficacy. Some FGF ligands (particularly FGF2) have been demonstrated to enhance tissue repair (e.g. skin burns, grafts, and ulcers) in a range of clinical settings.

To the southwest the park adjoins the Amap√° State Forest, a sustainable use conservation unit established in 2006. The Park is significant because it is situated on the coastline of Brazil; the only one in the rainforest that enjoys such a location. This means that the faunal and floral species found here are quite different from those of the areas situated further inland. The park is accessible by boat and provides a fascinating look at the very different ecosystems of the coast and the jungle, juxtaposed with one another. The Cabo Orange National Park covers varied ecosystems, examples of which are mangroves, natural fields, fluvial marine forests, floodable areas, and terra firm, besides rich fauna. The natural beauties, rather well preserved and with evident tourist appeal ‚Äì the case of the Cassipor√©, Cunani, Ua√ß√°, and Oiapoque ‚Äì allow for boat, canoe, and launch trips and the practice of rafting. The vast biodiversity makes possible visitation for contemplating vegetal and animal species, above all birds, in addition to projects of environmental education and scientific research (main objectives of the national parks). History The Cabo Orange National Park was created by decree 84.913 of 15 July 1980 with the objective of protecting flora, fauna and natural beauty. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The consultative council was created by IBAMA on 9 March 2006. The management plan was approved on 17 January 2011. On 22 March 2012 ICMBio and the Oiapoque fishermen came to an agreement mediated by the Federal Public Ministry over fishing in the park's waters. On 2013, the government of Brazil has named it the 12th Wetland of International Importance, under Ramsar Convention.http://www.ramsar.org/news/brazil%E2%80%99s-twelfth-ramsar-site Conservation The park is classified as IUCN protected-area category II (national park). The basic objective is the preservation of natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty. This enables the conduct of scientific research, the development of educational activities and environmental interpretation, recreation in contact with nature and eco- tourism. It is part of the Amap√° Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003. The park is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Protected species in the park include the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguar (Panthera onca), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata), West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) and Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis).

It is synthesized as a 155 amino acid polypeptide, whose mature form is a non-glycosylated 17-18 kDa protein. Fibroblast growth factor protein was first purified in 1975, but soon afterwards others using different conditions isolated acidic FGF, Heparin- binding growth factor-1, and Endothelial cell growth factor-1. Gene sequencing revealed that this group was actually the same growth factor and that FGF1 was a member of a family of FGF proteins. FGF-1 has no definitive signal sequence and thus is not secreted through classical pathways, but it does appear to form a disulfide linked dimer inside cells that associate with a complex of proteins at the cell membrane (including S100A13 and Syt1) which then help flip it through the membrane to the exterior of the cell. Once in the reducing conditions of the surrounding tissue, the dimer dissociates into monomeric FGF1 that can enter systemic circulation or be sequestered in tissues binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix. FGF1 can then bind to and exert its effects via specific fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins which themselves constitute a family of closely related molecules. In addition to its extracellular activity, FGF1 can also function intracellularly. The protein has a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) but the route that FGF1 takes to get to the nucleus is unclear and it appears that some sort of cell surface receptor binding is necessary, followed by its internalization and translocation to the nucleus whereupon it can interact with nuclear isoforms of FGFRs. This is different from FGF2 which also can activate nuclear FGFRs but has splicing variants of the protein that never leave the cell and go directly to the nucleus.  Function  FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. This protein functions as a modifier of endothelial cell migration and proliferation, as well as an angiogenic factor. It acts as a mitogen for a variety of mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells in vitro, thus is thought to be involved in organogenesis. Three alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described. FGF1 is multifunctional with many reported effects. For one example, in mice with diet-induced diabetes that is an experimental equivalent of type 2 diabetes in humans, a single injection of the FGF1 protein is enough to restore blood sugar levels to a healthy range for > 2 days.

The British Crime Survey had been first carried out in 1982 and further surveys were carried out in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2001. Since April 2001, BCS interviews had been carried out on a continuous basis and detailed results from that point are now reported by financial years. Headline measures are updated quarterly based on interviews conducted in the previous 12 months. Since 1994 there has been a separate Northern Ireland Crime Survey, on a biennial basis from 2001, and continuously from January 2005. It is produced by the Statistics and Research Branch of the NIO. It is broadly comparable to the BCS in England and Wales. The Home Office asserts that the Crime Survey for England and Wales can provide a better reflection of the true level of crime than police statistics since it includes crimes that have not been reported to, or recorded by, the police. For example, due to widespread no criming, over one third of reports of violent crimes are not recorded by police.Victims let down by poor crime-recording The Home Office also claims that it measures crime more accurately than Police statistics since it captures crimes that people may not bother to report because they think the crime was too trivial or the police could not do much about it. It also provides a better measure of trends over time since it has adopted a consistent methodology and is unaffected by changes in reporting or recording practices. Example of statistics gathered by the Crime Survey for England and Wales In 2003/04 the number of robbery offences in England and Wales, for people aged 16 and over was around 283,000. In 2004/05 the number of robbery offences in England and Wales, for people aged 16 and over was around 255,000. The survey does not measure robbery offences among victims under 16 years. Data access Data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales can be downloaded for research and teaching use via the UK Data Service website. Datasets since 1982 are available under a standard End User Licence; in addition, certain data from the Crime Survey (1996 to present) are subject to more restrictive Special Licence or Secure Access conditions than the main survey.Crime Survey for England and Wales catalogue page, UK Data Service, retrieved 8 November 2013 There are also bespoke versions of the survey data available for teaching purposes. Criticism Professor Ken Pease, former acting head of the Home Office's police research group, and Professor Graham Farrell of Loughborough University, estimated in 2007 that the survey was underreporting crime by about 3 million incidents per year due to its practice of arbitrarily capping the number of repeated incidents that could be reported in a given year at five. If true the error means that violent crime might actually stand at 4.4 million incidents per year, an 82% increase over the 2.4 million previously thought. Since the five crimes per person cap has been consistent since the BCS began this might not affect the long-term trends, however it takes little account of crimes such as domestic violence, figures for which would allegedly be 140% higher without the cap. The ONS responded by explaining that because victims of ongoing abuse often are unable to recall the detail and number of specific incidents it makes sense to record this crime as a series of repeat victimisation. These are only recorded in this manner if the incidents described were ‚Äòthe same thing, done under the same circumstances and probably by the same people‚Äô. http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime- statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/high-frequency-repeat- victimisation.pdf The methodology was subsequently changed after consultation in 2016, resulting in the first results without the cap in early 2019. This removed the limit, and also recorded \\"[r]epeat victimisation [...] defined as the same thing, done under the same circumstances, probably by the same people, against the same victim\\". Improving victimisation estimates derived from the Crime Survey for England and Wales The resulting change did not affect overall trends, or significantly increase the estimates except in violent offences which saw increases between 6% and 31%. Lord de Mauley has said the BCS omits rape, assault, drug offences, fraud, forgery, crime against businesses and murder, while accepting that it \\"is accepted as a gold standard by most British academics and internationally\\".PM's use of crime figures 'is propaganda' One criticism is that both the youth survey and the adult surveys do not distinguish between a) crimes not reported to the police because they thought the police would do nothing or b) crimes not reported to the police because the victim thought them too trivial.

History Under the terms of UNSCR 1244 Kosovo came under the administration of the United Nations at the conclusion of Kosovo conflict of 1999. Kosovo is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the Yugoslav) government versus Kosovo's largely ethnic-Albanian population. Resolution 1244 permitted the United Nations to establish and oversee the development of \\"provisional, democratic self-governing institutions\\" in Kosovo. The United Nations Administration established an internationally supervised Kosovo Police Service in 1999. A Joint Interim Administrative Structure was established in May 2000. In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework which established these Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG). The first elections for these institutions were held in. Following these elections UNMIK gradually transferred increased administrative competencies to the PISG. Whilst UNSCR 1244 formerly maintained Kosovo as part of Serbia, international negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo. On February 17, 2008, representatives of the people of Kosovo unilaterally declared Kosovo's independence and subsequently adopted the Constitution of Republic of Kosovo, which came into effect on 15 June 2008.

Function  FGF-3 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family. FGF3 binds to Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) to serve as a negative regulator of bone growth during ossification. Effectively, FGF-3 inhibits proliferation of chondrocytes within growth plate. FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities and are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion.  Clinical significance  The FGF3 gene was identified by its similarity with mouse fgf3/int-2, a proto-oncogene activated in virally induced mammary tumors in the mouse. Frequent amplification of this gene has been found in human tumors, which may be important for neoplastic transformation and tumor progression. Studies of the similar genes in mouse and chicken suggested the role in inner ear formation. Also, haploinsufficiency in the FGF3 gene is thought to cause otodental syndrome.

They opposed slavery, which was institutionalized in the French colonies of the Caribbean and North America, and the African slave trade. The Society was created in Paris in 1788, and operated until 1793, during years of the French Revolution. It was led by Jacques Pierre Brissot, with advice from British Thomas Clarkson, who led the abolitionist movement in the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the beginning of 1789, the Society had 141 members. During the five-year period that it operated, it published anti-slavery literature and frequently addressed its concerns on a substantive political level in the National Assembly of France. In February 1794, the National Assembly passed the Universal Emancipation decree, which effectively freed all colonial slaves and gave them equal rights. This decision was later reversed under Napoleon, who tried unsuccessfully to reinstitute slavery in the colonies and to regain control of Saint-Domingue, where a slave rebellion was underway. Several articles and monographs have explored the question of how influential the Society was in bringing about the abolition of slavery. Historians disagree about their influence, with some crediting the Amis des Noirs as instrumental in abolition, to others who say the Society was nothing more than a \\"soci√©t√© de pens√©e\\" (philosophical society). History The economy of France was dependent upon revenues from the colonies, which were slave societies based largely on production of sugar from cane plantations. The French economy thrived due to the lucrative triangle trade. Demand for sugar was high in Europe. Conditions on the sugar plantations on the islands of Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and Martinique, in the Caribbean, were so harsh that slave mortality was very high. This required steady importing of new slaves from Africa. In La Louisiane, in the southern United States, slavery was also the basis of the economy in the New Orleans and Mobile regions. Southern Louisiana had numerous sugar plantations. Figures indicate that slave-trade activity alone during the years leading up to the French Revolution resulted in some profit percentages exceeding 100 percent. In 1784, for example, the outfitter Chaurands realized a profit of 110 percent through the use of a single ship, the Brune. In 1789, one outfitter reached 120 per cent profit on his voyages. Jacques Pierre Brissot organized the Soci√©t√© des amis des Noirs in February 1788. A follower of the Philosophes, Brissot's anti-slavery efforts were also due to his exposure to humanitarian activities on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, where he visited Philadelphia's constitutional convention following the American Revolution, he became absorbed by [Thomas Jefferson]'s humanitarian ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence. In England, Thomas Clarkson invited Brissot to attend a meeting of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. So enthused was Brissot that shortly thereafter he founded an abolitionist society in Paris. Its objectives were to suppress the slave trade and, at a later date, to attain equal rights for free persons of color. This was a class, generally in the French colonies, of persons of mixed French and African ancestry, generally born to French colonial fathers and mothers of African descent (some of whom were also of mixed-race.) The French-born or French Creoles extended them some rights, although not full equality to those of \\"pure\\" French descent. The Amis advocated freedom in the French colonies, arguing that the ideas of the Revolution should extend to the colonies. The French concept of ' did not include the liberation of slaves, because the National Assembly argued that such abolition would be detrimental to the economy. The Amis des Noirs pushed for the abolition of slavery, although Clarkson recommended they reduce their demands to ending the Atlantic slave trade (which Great Britain and the United States did in 1808.) Activities=Abolitionist literature Brissot decided at the outset that he would publish written works to influence the public and politicians. and this he did in profusion. The Society published French translations of British abolitionist literature, and also works written by Brissot (\\"M√©moire sur les Noirs de l'Amerique septentrionale\\"La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968)), written in the midst of the French Revolution. It also published work by other members of the Amis des Noirs, such as √âtienne Clavi√®re (\\"De la France et des Etats-Unis\\" ‚Äì co-written with Brissot) and Condorcet (\\"R√©flexions sur l'esclavage des negres\\"La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 6, p. 34.). Members gave lectures to other societies as well, such as the Amis de l'humanit√©,La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 8, p. 86. and the Soci√©t√© des Amis de la Constitution.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 8, p. 173. It was a reflection of not only the \\"Philosophe upbringing\\" of the Society members, but also of their efforts to be active participants in the moulding of the revolutionary government. La Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs was most active distributing its anti-slavery literature in and around Paris, due to the lack of a stable and reliable communications network, particularly as the French Revolution proceeded. The Society did make attempts to convey its message to those living outside Paris. For instance, in 1791, the society gained assistance from its Jacobin friends: \\"The Friends of the Blacks had several meetings with their friends in Jacobin clubs in provincial cities and sent to every city government a lengthy pamphlet exposing the injustices done to people of colour.\\" Political activities \\"Mortals are equal, it is not birth, but virtue alone that makes the difference\\". The political activities of the Friends of the Blacks included addresses to the National Assembly, for instance, speeches promoting the abolition of the slave trade were made in February and April 1790. Another address was delivered a few months later.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 7, p. 245. Four months later, a discourse was presented concerning the violence in Saint Domingue, which had broken out in a struggle for rights by free people of color and slaves.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 8, p. 90. In July 1791, Clavi√®re addressed the National Assembly's commercial interests, discussing trade relations between France and its colonies.\\"A toutes les Villes de Commerce, a toutes les Manufactures, aux Colonies, a toutes les Soci√©t√©s des Amis de la Constitution; Addresse dans laquelle on approfondit les relations politiques et commerciales entre la M√©tropole et les Colonies, etc.\\"La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 9, p. 1. The Society also directly appealed to government individuals such as Antoine Barnave, a member of the Committee on Colonies, and Jacques Necker, France's Controller-General of Finance. Although Necker acknowledged that slavery was inhumane, he would not sanction emancipation in French colonies unless the practice of slavery and the slave trade were halted simultaneously in every country. He believed that this was needed to maintain the existing economic balance among nations. In a 1789 letter the Society urged Necker to form a committee similar to the one in England, and expressed hopes that the actions of the English parliament might have a positive effect on the Estates- General.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 7, p. 53. Other Society addresses denounced individuals in the colonies. One such incident occurred in 1791, when the Amis des Noirs responded to criticism written by pro-slaver Arthur Dillon, D√©put√© de la Martinique,\\"La Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs Arthur Dillon, D√©put√© de la Martinique a l'Assembl√©e Nationale\\"La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 8, p. 173. and owner of a large plantation. In 1789, the royal government had requested petitions of grievances from all parts of the country. During the election of representatives to the Estates-General, Condorcet asked for a demand for abolition of the slave trade to be included in these cahiers de dol√©ances. Out of the 600 cahiers assembled, fewer than 50 called for an end to the slave trade and slavery. Society member Abb√© Gr√©goire recommended in the fall of 1789 that two deputies to the Assembly be chosen from the population of free persons of colour. This was accepted by the Committee on Verification of Credentials in the National Assembly. Gregoire's was unable to present his proposal to the National Assembly because every time he rose to speak, he was shouted down by the colonists (usually planters) in the Assembly. In March 1790, Gr√©goire questioned the article on voting rights in the National Assembly, urging that free men of colour be given the franchise. The colonial deputies persuaded the National Assembly to close discussion of the matter. During that same month Barnave, a pro-slavery advocate, delivered his report on maintaining the slave trade. When Mirabeau, a member of the Society, advanced to the rostrum to protest, he was drowned out by cries of the opposition. Focusing on the rights of free men of colour, Gr√©goire and Alexandre P√©tion (another member of the Society) warned the Assembly on 15 May 1791 that if these people were not given their rights, violence would ensue in the colonies. Because of the increasing conflict in the colonies, as well as the growing influence of free men of colour with some deputies, Barnave felt that the members of the Society could not be ignored: \\"We can't win against the influence of the Friends of the Blacks.\\" On 15 May the Assembly decreed that all men of colour would be granted equal rights if they were born of free parents. Further legislation passed on 4 April 1792 (with influence from La Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs), stated that every free man of colour now enjoyed equal rights. Opposition from pro-slavery groups=The Committee on Colonies The Committee on Colonies was formed in March 1790 to deal with escalating problems arising from slavery unrest in the colonies. Its resolution of the problem leaned heavily in favour of the colonists, and its membership generally had little sympathy for conditions of slaves. The members of the committee included colonial landowners (who were usually slaveholders), other slave owners, lawyers and merchants, and all were advocates of French commercial interests. The final report of the Committee did not alleviate any of the problems relating to slavery. It stressed that it did not wish to interfere in the commercial interests of the colonies: \\"The National Assembly declares that it had not intended to innovate in any branch of commerce direct or indirect of France with its colonies...\\" A group of National Assembly deputies who were either colonists or slave trade merchants lobbied the French chambers of commerce and city governments to maintain the slave trade and slavery, proclaiming that economic disaster would result from its abolition. The deputies argued their point so effectively that members of La Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs feared abolition would cause chaos. One such pro-slavery group was composed of the lobbyists for the French chambers of commerce, who designated themselves as the \\"Deputies Extraordinary of Manufactures and Commerce.\\" Their main efforts focused on influencing the Committee on Agriculture and Commerce to maintain slavery and the slave trade. Since revenue from the colonies was collected mainly from the sale of slaves and crops, the committee was investigating the economic ramifications should this source of income cease to exist. Historian Quinney wrote in 1970 that Barnave's non-committal report to the National Assembly resulted from he learning that the Committee on Agriculture and Commerce \\"had already decided to advise the National Assembly to retain the trade and slavery.\\" Massiac Club A pro-slavery organization called the Massiac Club, headquartered in Paris, was composed of colonial planters living in Paris and throughout France. The club had its main headquarters in Paris, with chapters located in the provinces. Realizing that success related to political influence, the club proceeded to systematically contact government officials. The Massiac members opposed any type of abolition legislation, and communicated with each colonial deputy to ensure that pro-slavery interests were maintained. Mirabeau stated that when he attempted to sway the deputies in favour of abolition, every official he spoke to had already been approached by a member of the Massiac club. The Massiac group published and distributed literature, responding in toto to practically every idea the Amis des Noirs had put forward. In a leaflet distributed to members of the Comit√© de Commerce de l'Assembl√©e Nationale, the Massiac accused the Amis des Noirs of being involved in subversive activity. The Massiac Club published a handbill that said the abolitionists were not truly humanitarian philanthropists, but rather an organization attempting to subvert social order. They claimed the Amis des Noirs should be viewed as counter-revolutionaries, and pro-British. The pro- slavers also distributed leaflets specifically denouncing individuals: Brissot, Gr√©goire and P√©tion. They supported the slave trade in debates held in district assemblies within Paris, and attempted to influence voting in these districts when the question of the slave trade was introduced. Criticisms=Organisational failings Historians have concluded that the Society was virtually impotent due to its organization, strategy, and membership criteria. In terms of organization, Quinney refers to the group's ineffective operations, stating that the government, which contained pro- slavery elements, had a nationwide propaganda network, while the Society was mainly Paris-based. Resnick concurs when he states: \\"Both leadership and membership at large were drawn heavily from the Paris area, with no established network of regional filiations.\\" In addition, they held meetings irregularly, without full membership present. Even in 1789, Thomas Clarkson commented upon the poor attendance at the meetings. The lack of organization and continuity was shown by the departure of Brissot in June 1789 for the United States to meet abolitionists, although he had organized the Society's first meeting in February 1789. He did not become active in the Society until the spring of 1790, when he again became the Society's president. The Society required presidents to serve only three months; they shared responsibility, but the short tenure hindered continuity of effort within the organization.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 6, pp. 27‚Äì28. The Society decided that a \\"General Assembly\\" would be elected from within. This body would not only represent the Society and make the rules, but would also hold exclusive voting rights in the election of the officials.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 6, p. 26. Hence, from the organization's inception, rank and file membership were excluded from participating in the Society's operations. Elitist membership policies Analysis of the membership list of the Society reveals a predominance of elite individuals. Although they possessed great influence, they had most of their power in Paris. There was a lack of popular participation, which reflected the structure of government and society. The founding members of the Society included such notables as Brissot, Condorcet, Saint-Lambert, Lafayette, La Rochefoucauld, and Clavi√®re. The Society began with a handful of abolitionists, increased to ninety-five by 1789, and would swell to a maximum of 141 associates in later years. Of the 141 members, twenty-five percent were government employees, twenty-nine percent were nobility, and thirty-eight were professionals; the total of elitist membership made up 92% of all members.There were two sources used to accumulate the names of the members: Tableau des Membres de la Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs. Ann√©e 1789 ‚Äì S.I. (Paris), s.d. (1789) and (A list of members is presented at the end of this article.) Cohen observed: \\"It [the Society]... concentrated on having important, well-connected members, rather than large members ... The members [were] drawn from the French social elite ...\\" The Society restricted members to those who could pay dues and be recommended by four other men. There were different fee scales: two Louis per year for those who lived in Paris, and 24 livres per year for those living in the provinces.La R√©volution fran√ßaise et l'abolition de l'esclavage (1968) 6, pp. 19‚Äì20. The membership practices of La Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs both hampered its attempt at increasing in size, and affected its ability to become a credible and effective entity. Relationship to English abolitionists Perroud states that Brissot's trip to London in November 1787 prompted him to form an identical chapter in France. The English society had been formed only a few months earlier, in May 1787. A group of abolitionist friends in Paris discussed how the London society encouraged others to join its cause, and noted that France and England had a commonality with respect to abolishing slavery. The Society translated and published English anti-slavery literature. Brissot, shortly after founding the Society, wrote to Quaker James Philips, an original member of the English abolitionist society. Brissot stated his intention for the Amis des Noirs to translate and publish English anti-slavery works for distribution to the French public. Many French citizens believed that the Society was an offshoot of the English abolitionist society, and some suspected the English were paying them to promote their cause. rt. This resulted in a loss of credibility in the eyes of the French populace. Britain and France had historically been antagonistic towards each other for decades. Britain had defeated France in the Seven Years' War and taken over much of its territory in North America. Influences from England were seen as \\"dealing with the enemy.\\" This view extended to encompass the activities of the Society. The perception that it was a vehicle for English infiltration into French matters overshadowed its intentions. Outcome The Society was rendered inactive by the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution, begun as a slave rebellion, as well as by the major crisis of the First French Republic (with the start of the French Revolutionary Wars). It remained active until 1793, publishing its calls in papers such as Patriote fran√ßais, L'Analyse des papiers anglais, Le Courrier de Provence, and La chronique de Paris. On 4 February 1794 (16 Pluvi√¥se an II), approximately a year after the demise of the Amis des Noirs, the National Convention passed the Emancipation Declaration, abolishing slavery: ::' [The National Convention declares that slavery of Negroes in all the Colonies is abolished; consequently it decrees that all men, without distinction of color, domiciled in the colonies are French citizens, and shall enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The public safety committee was charged with regularly reporting on measures taken to ensure implementation of this Decree].

It is a grade I listed building.  Architecture  Local mill-owner Sir William Houldsworth commissioned Alfred Waterhouse in the 1870s. Construction took place between 1881 and 1883, paid for entirely by Houldsworth, with consecration in 1883. The church was named after Houldsworth's wife. Described by Pevsner as \\"a superb job, big-boned, with nothing mean outside or in\\", the church is of Openshaw brick with Wrexham stone dressings. An almost separate belltower contains eight bells cast by Taylor. Pillars supporting the nave's roof were transported from the nearby canal to the site on the backs of elephants from Belle Vue Zoo. There is a marble screen with four figures on top, possibly the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The strikingly modern Stations of the Cross, by Graeme Willson were commissioned in 1983, and include local views such as Stockport Viaduct, and Pendlebury Hall on Lancashire Hill, Stockport.  Religion St. Elisabeth's is an Anglo-Catholic church, i.e. high church within the Church of England, reflecting Houldsworth's own beliefs. There are several services each week, the main Sung Mass being at 10:30 on Sunday.  Music  The organ was originally built by William Hill & Son of London. It was ordered in 1882 (as Job No. 1854) but was not completed until 1885. It had three manuals and pedals, with tubular pneumatic action linking the detached console on the south side of the choir stalls to the organ on the north side of the chancel, in an elevated position in the Triforium. It was rebuilt by Wadsworth Brothers of Manchester in 1929. During the late 1960s it was disastrously rebuilt by a small, local firm Charles H Smethurst Ltd, to a much reduced specification. The original specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register: http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec;_index=N02139  Rectory  The former rectory is a grade II* listed building A rectory, also designed by Alfred Waterhouse, was built for the church in 1874. It, and the walls the south and west of the church, are all grade II* listed buildings.  Use as film and TV set  St Elisabeth's was used as a set for the wedding of Ashley Peacock and Maxine Heavey in the TV soap opera Coronation Street. The Church also featured as the setting for the BBC children's drama Clay broadcast on CBBC, and later released on a BBC DVD (2008) BBC shop. Extensive modifications to the vestry and interior of the Church were required to change it into a Catholic church in 1960s Tyneside. It was based on the novel Clay by David Almond and starred Imelda Staunton. IMDB entry for Clay.

The city is located in the saddle between two heights. The area is noted for its dark marble and for gemstones that resembled garnets. Stephanus of Byzantium claims that there were two cities named Alabanda (Alabandeus) in Caria, but no other ancient source corroborates this. History Ancient Greek theatre According to legend, the city was founded by a Carian hero Alabandus. In the Carian language, the name is a combination of the words for horse ala and victory banda. On one occasion, Herodotus mentions Alabanda being located in Phrygia, instead of in Caria, but in fact the same city were meant. Amyntas II, son of the Achaemenid Persian official Bubares, is known to have been given the rule over the city by king Xerxes I (r. 486-465 BC). In the early Seleucid period, the city was part of the Chrysaorian League, a loose federation of nearby cities linked by economic and defensive ties and, perhaps, by ethnic ties. The city was renamed Antiochia of the Chrysaorians in honor of Seleucid king Antiochus III who preserved the city's peace. It was captured by Philip V of Macedon in 201 BC. The name reverted to Alabanda after the Seleucid defeat at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. The Romans occupied the city shortly thereafter. According to Cicero in Greece they worshiped a number of deified human beings, at Alabanda there was Alabandus.Cicero, De Natura Deorum. \\"In Greece they worship a number of deified human beings, Alabandus at Alabanda, Tennes at Tenedos, Leucothea, formerly Ino, and her son Palaemon throughout the whole of Greece.\\" In 40 BC, the rebel Quintus Labienus at the head of a Parthian army took the city. After Labienus's garrison was slaughtered by the city's inhabitants, the Parthian army stripped the city of its treasures. Under the Roman Empire, the city became a conventus (Pliny, V, xxix, 105) and Strabo reports on its reputation for high-living and decadence. The city minted its own coins down to the mid-third century. During the Byzantine Empire, the city was a created a bishopric. Famous residents included the orators Menecles and Hierocles, who were brothers. The ruins of Alabanda are 8 km west of √áine and consist of the remains of a theatre and a number of other buildings, but excavations have yielded very few inscriptions. Ecclesiastical history The names of some bishops of Alabanda are known because of their participation in church councils. Thus Theodoret was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Constantine at the Trullan Council in 692, another Constantine at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and John at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). The names of two non-orthodox bishops of the see are also known: Zeuxis, who was deposed for Monophysitism in 518, and Julian, who was bishop from around 558 to around 568 and was a Jacobite.Michel Le Quien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 909-910Sophrone P√©trid√®s, v.

Though the producers kept most of the original animation, David Bock and Peter Sherman wrote new text for a younger target audience, narrated by Ben Stiller (in Season 1) and Christian Slater (in Season 2), and interspersed the scenes with occasional quizzes to act as bumpers around the commercial breaks. New music was incorporated as well. Most marketing and advertising for the series focused on the dinosaur episodes. In addition, the final episode, the Prehistoric Planet Top 10 focused solely on the creatures from Walking With Dinosaurs. Most of the graphic content from the shows were removed to be more appropriate for children, small content edits were also done to allow original programs to fit in the 23 minutes of non-commercial time that a normal half-hour program has on network TV, resulting in footage from the shows to be trimmed down.

The Irish Unionists were the Irish wing of the Conservative Party. Biography He was born in D√∫n Laoghaire, County Dublin, second son of Arthur Samuels, a solicitor. He attended Trinity College, Dublin, before being called to the Irish Bar in 1877. He became a Queen's Counsel (QC) in 1894 and was called to the English bar in 1896. Samuels was Solicitor-General for Ireland 1917‚Äì1918 and Attorney-General for Ireland in 1918‚Äì1919. He was also made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1918. He was MP for Dublin University 1917‚Äì1919, having previously been defeated in a 1903 by-election for the same constituency. Samuels left the House of Commons when he was appointed to the office of Justice of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland in 1919, an office which he held until the court's abolition under the Courts of Justice Act 1924. In common with most of the judges of the old regime, he was not appointed to the High Court established under the 1924 Act. He died a year later. Maurice Healy in The Old Munster Circuit praised his personal qualities, his erudition and his valuable book on the financial aspects of Home Rule; but as a Law Officer and judge dismissed him as \\"undistinguished\\". Family He married in 1881 Emma Margaret Irwin of Howth, by whom he was the father of the barrister and writer Arthur P. I. Samuels (1886-1916). The younger Arthur was an authority on Edmund Burke and edited a collection of his correspondence and writings, which he had almost completed when his work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. He became a captain in the Royal Irish Rifles, and was killed on the Western Front in September 1916. His father completed his book on Burke, which was published in 1923. Young Arthur had married Dorothy Young of Milltown, County Antrim, in 1913. Samuels' daughter, Dorothy Helen Daly (1892-1942), served during World War 2 as an ambulance driver with the American Ambulance Great Britain. She was killed by a German air raid during the Exeter Blitz on 4 May 1942. References * Who's Who of British Members of Parliament, Vol. III 1919-1945, edited by M. Stenton & S.

However, it is generally accepted that modern golf developed in Scotland from the Middle Ages onwards. The game did not find international popularity until the late 19th century, when it spread into the rest of the United Kingdom and then to the British Empire and the United States. Origins Golf Book, circa 1540, shows a game with similarities to modern day golf e.g. knocking a ball down a hole with a crooked headed club.

The winner was whoever hit the ball with the fewest strokes into a target several hundred yards away. Some scholars argue that this game of putting a small ball in a hole in the ground using golf clubs was also played in 17th-century Netherlands and that this predates the game in Scotland.:: The World-Wide Encyclopedia, 1896, \\"Golf\\" There are also other reports of earlier accounts of a golf-like game from continental Europe.golf :: Scots as inventors: a popular fallacy - Britannica Online Encyclopedia In the 1261 Middle Dutch manuscript of the Flemish poet Jacob van Maerlant's Boeck Merlijn mention is made of a ball game \\"mit ener coluen\\" (with a colf/kolf [club]).

One of the exceptions to this ordinance was \\"den bal mitter colven te slaen buten der veste\\" (to play the ball with a club outside the town walls).Steven J. van Hengel, Early Golf, 1982 Two years later, in 1389, the regent Albrecht offered the citizens of Haarlem a field called \\"De Baen\\" (the course) to be used exclusively for playing games ‚Äì especially colf ‚Äì because these were too dangerous within the city walls.Robin Bargmann, Serendipity of Early Golf, 2010 A game similar to modern day golf features in a book of hours from 1540, which has, on the basis of this association, acquired the name of the Golf Book. It was illustrated by a Flemish artist called Simon Bening. In 1571 the book, \\"Biblia dat is, de gantsche Heylighe Schrift, grondelic ende trouwclick verduydtschet\\", describes the game of \\"Kolf\\" played with a \\"bat\\" and \\"sach\\".Biblia dat is, de gantsche Heylighe Schrift, grondelic ende trouwclick verduydtschet, Section 4, lines 16, 17, 18. 1571 Book, \\"Biblia dat is, de gantsche Heylighe Schrift, grondelic ende trouwelick\\", reference for the game of Kolf In 1597 the crew of Willem Barentsz played \\"colf\\" during their stay at Nova Zembla, as recorded by Gerrit de Veer in his diary: In December 1650, the settlers of Fort Orange (near present-day Albany, New York) played the first recorded round of kolf (golf) in America. The Dutch settlers played kolf year round. During the spring, summer and fall it was played in fields. In the winter it was played on ice with the same rules. Then on December 10, 1659, the ruler passed an ordinance against playing golf in the streets of the same city. Early golf in Scotland The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews The modern game of golf is generally considered to be a Scottish invention. A spokesman for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, one of the oldest Scottish golf organisations, said \\"Stick and ball games have been around for many centuries, but golf as we know it today, played over 18 holes, clearly originated in Scotland.\\" The word golf, or in Scots gowf [g åuf], is usually thought to be a Scots alteration of Dutch \\"colf\\" or \\"colve\\" meaning \\"stick, \\"club\\", \\"bat\\", itself related to the Proto-Germanic language *kulth- as found in Old Norse kolfr meaning \\"bell clapper\\", and the German Kolben meaning \\"mace or club\\".Online Etymology Dictionary The Dutch term Kolven refers to a related sport where the lowest number of strokes needed to hit a ball with a mallet into a hole determines the winner; according to the \\"Le grand dictionnaire fran√ßois-flamen\\" printed 1643 is stated the Dutch term to Flemish: \\"Kolf, zest Kolve; Kolfdrager, Sergeant; Kolf, Kolp, Goulfe.\\"Le grand dictionnaire fran√ßois-flamen, Volumes 1-2 under \\"KOL\\", no page given The first documented mention of golf in Scotland appears in a 1457 Act of the Scottish Parliament, an edict issued by King James II of Scotland prohibiting the playing of the games of gowf and futball as these were a distraction from archery practice for military purposes. Bans were again imposed in Acts of 1471 and 1491, with golf being described as \\"an unprofitable sport\\". Golf was banned again by parliament under King James IV of Scotland, but golf clubs and balls were bought for him in 1502 when he was visiting Perth, and on subsequent occasions when he was in St Andrews and Edinburgh.Golf in Scotland 1457-1744- National Library of Scotland Mary, Queen of Scots played, and she was accused of playing \\"pell-mell and golf\\" at Seton Palace after her husband Lord Darnley was murdered in 1567, when she ought to have been in solemn mourning.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1603, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 558, the original has \\"palmall and goif.\\" George Buchanan wrote that she had been following her \\"usual amusements in the adjoining fields that were plainly not adapted to women\\".James Aikman, History of Scotland of George Buchanan, vol. 2 (Glasgow, 1827), pp. 497-8. An entry in the Town Council Minutes of Edinburgh for 19 April 1592 includes golf in a list of pursuits to be avoided on the Sabbath.Marguerite Wood (ed.), Extracts From The Records Of The Burgh Of Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd 1927, p. 63. On 13 February 1593 the Duke of Lennox and Sir James Sandilands decided to go down to Leith to play golf. On the way they met members of the Graham family who were feuding with Sandilands, and fought with pistols instead.Annie Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 49. The account book of lawyer Sir John Foulis of Ravelston records that he played golf at Musselburgh Links on 2 March 1672, and this has been accepted as proving that The Old Links, Musselburgh, is the oldest playing golf course in the world. There is also a story that Mary, Queen of Scots played there in 1567. James VII of Scotland, while still Duke of Albany, was said to have played the first international golf contest in 1681 when he participated in a game against two English courtiers as part of a bet over rights to claim the game for Scotland or England. His teammate was said to be one John Paterson, who received as payment, enough money to build a mansion on the area of Edinburgh now known as Golfers Land.https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golfer-s-land Instructions, golf club rules and competitions Pub sign on the Golf Tavern on Bruntsfield Links, 2011 The earliest known instructions for playing golf have been found in the diary of Thomas Kincaid, a medical student who played on the course at Bruntsfield Links, near Edinburgh University, and at Leith Links. His notes include his views on an early handicap system. In his entry for 20 January 1687 he noted how \\"After dinner I went out to the Golve\\", and described his Golf stroke: The oldest surviving rules of golf were written in 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which played at Leith Links. Their \\"Articles and Laws in Playing at Golf, now preserved in the National Library of Scotland, became known as the Leith Rules and the document supports the club's claim to be the oldest golf club, though an almanac published about a century later is the first record of a rival claim that The Royal Burgess Golfing Society had been set up in 1735. The instructions in the Leith Rules formed the basis for all subsequent codes, for example requiring that \\"Your Tee must be upon the ground\\" and \\"You are not to change the Ball which you strike off the Tee\\". The 1744 competition for the Gentlemen Golfers' Competition for the Silver Club, a trophy in the form of a silver golf club provided as sponsorship by Edinburgh Town Council, was won by surgeon John Rattray, who was required to attach to the trophy a silver ball engraved with his name, beginning a long tradition. Rattray joined the Jacobite Rising of 1745 and as a result was imprisoned in Inverness, but was saved from being hanged by the pleading of his fellow golfer Duncan Forbes of Culloden, Lord President of the Court of Session. Rattray was released in 1747, and won the Silver Club three times in total.  The spread of golf =Early excursions In 1603 James VI of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England. His son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales and his courtiers played golf at Blackheath, London, from which the Royal Blackheath Golf Club traces its origins.Our History, Royal Blackheath Golf Club There is evidence that Scottish soldiers, expatriates and immigrants took the game to British colonies and elsewhere during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In the early 1770s, the first African golf course was built on Bunce Island, in Sierra Leone, by British slave traders.David Hancock, Citizens of the World: London Merchants and the Integration of the British Atlantic Community, 1735-1785, Cambridge University Press, p. 1-2 The Royal Calcutta Golf Club (1829),History of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club Royal Calcutta Golf Club website the Mauritius Gymkhana Club (1844) and the club at Pau (1856)History of the club Pau Golf Club website in south western France are notable reminders of these excursions and are the oldest golf clubs outside of the British Isles. The club at Pau is the oldest in continental Europe. However, it was not until the late 19th century that Golf became more widely popular outside of its Scottish home. The late 19th-century boom In the 1850s Queen Victoria and Prince Albert built Balmoral Castle in the Scottish Highlands.The History of Balmoral , Balmoral Castle official website The railways came to St Andrews in 1852.St Andrews Railway, Railbrit.co.uk By the 1860s there were fast and regular services from London to Edinburgh. The royal enthusiasm for Scotland, the much improved transport links and the writings of Sir Walter Scott caused a boom for tourism in Scotland and a wider interest in Scottish history and culture outside of the country.1865 - Queen Victoria and the Highlands , National Library of Scotland websiteQueen Victoria takes to the throne, Scotland's History, BBCThe year of Sir Walter Scott, The Herald Newspaper online This period also coincided with the development of the Gutty; a golf ball made of Gutta Percha which was cheaper to mass-produce, more durable and more consistent in quality and performance than the feather-filled leather balls used previously.The Gutty, GolfBallMuseum.com Golf began to spread across the rest of the British Isles. In 1864 the golf course at the resort of Westward Ho! became the first new club in England since Blackheath,The Oldest Course in England, Royal North Devon Golf Club Website and the following year London Scottish Golf Club was founded on Wimbledon Common. In 1880 England had 12 courses, rising to 50 in 1887 and over 1000 by 1914.Scottish Croquet: The English Golf Boom, 1880-1914 John Lowerson, History Today, May 1983 The game in England had progressed sufficiently by 1890 to produce its first English-born Open Champion, John Ball. The game also spread further across the empire. By the 1880s golf clubs had been established in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. Singapore followed in 1891. Courses were also established in several continental European resorts for the benefit of British visitors.  United States  17th-century America: In December 1650, near Fort Orange (modern city of Albany, New York), a group of four men were playing Kolf in pairs for points. On July 22, 1657 several men were cited and warned not to play Kolf on Sundays.The New Netherland Register, Volume 1, page 73 On December 10, 1659 an ordinance was issued to prevent playing Kolf in the streets of Albany due to too many windows being broken. A young trained elephant used as a caddy on a Florida golf course in 1922 Evidence of early golf in what is now the United States includes a 1739 record for a shipment of golf equipment to a William Wallace in Charleston, South Carolina, an advertisement published in the Royal Gazette of New York City in 1779 for golf clubs and balls,The Glorious World of Golf, Peter Dobriner, 1973 , and the establishment of the South Carolina Golf Club in 1787 in Charleston. However, as in England, it was not until the late 19th century that golf started to become firmly established. Several clubs established in the 1880s can make claim to be the oldest extant in the country, but what is not disputed is that as a result of two competing \\"National Amateur Championships\\" being played in 1894, delegates from the Newport Country Club, Saint Andrew's Golf Club, Yonkers, New York, The Country Club, Chicago Golf Club, and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club met in New York City to form what was to become the United States Golf Association (USGA). By 1910 there were 267 clubs. During the Roaring Twenties the game expanded greatly in popularity and by 1932 there were over 1,100 golf clubs affiliated to the USGA. In 1922 Walter Hagen became the first native born American to win the British Open Championship. The expansion of the game was halted by the Great Depression and World War II, but continued in the post war years. By 1980 there were over 5,908 USGA affiliated clubs. That figure grew to over 10,600 by 2013. Starting in the 1920s, and growing through the 1990s, many residential golf course communities have been built.Soffian, Seth (15 May 1999). Tee Time; Home buyers drawn to luxuries of golf-course community liviing, Ocala Star-Banner Japan After the Meiji restoration of 1868 Japan made a concerted effort to modernise its economy and industry on western lines. Japanese came to Europe and America to establish trade links and study and acquire the latest developments in business, science and technology, and westerners came to Japan to help establish schools, factories, shipyards and banks. In 1903 a group of British expatriates established the first golf club in Japan, at Kobe.\\"Gliding past Fuji - C.H. Alison in Japan\\", Thomas MacWood, GolfClubAtlas.com In 1913 the Tokyo Golf club at Komazawa was established for and by native Japanese who had encountered golf in the United States, but it was moved to Asaka in Saitama prefecture in 1932. In 1924 the Japan Golf Association was established by the seven clubs then in existence.About (the) JGA Japanese Golf Association Website During the 1920s and early 1930s several new courses were built, however the great depression and increasing anti- Western sentiment limited the growth of the game. By the time of the Japanese attacks against the USA and British Empire in 1941 there were 23 courses.Japan Golfcourses and Deforestation , Trade Environment Database, American University, Washington DC, 1997 During the subsequent war most of the courses were requisitioned for military use or returned to agricultural production. In the postwar period, Japan's golf courses came under the control of the occupying forces. It was not until 1952 that courses started to be returned to Japanese control. By 1956 there were 72 courses and in 1957 Torakichi Nakamura and Koichi Ono won the Canada Cup (now World Cup) in Japan, an event that is often cited as igniting the post-war golf boom.Torakichi Nakamura Obituary, New York Times, 2008 Between 1960 and 1964 the number of golf courses in Japan increased from 195 to 424. By the early 1970s there were over 1,000 courses. The 1987 Resort Law that reduced protection on agricultural land and forest preserves created a further boom in course construction and by 2009 there were over 2,400 courses. The popularity of golf in Japan also caused many golf resorts to be created across the Pacific Rim.Japan Golf Trade Environment Database, American University, Washington DC, 1997 The environmental effect of these recent golf booms is seen as a cause for concern by many.  Tibet  Hugh Edward Richardson introduced golf to Tibet, although he noted that the ball \\"tended to travel 'rather too far in the thin air'.\\" Golf course evolution Golf courses have not always had eighteen holes. The St Andrews Links occupy a narrow strip of land along the sea. As early as the 15th century, golfers at St Andrews established a trench through the undulating terrain, playing to holes whose locations were dictated by topography. The course that emerged featured eleven holes, laid out end to end from the clubhouse to the far end of the property. One played the holes out, turned around, and played the holes in, for a total of 22 holes. In 1764, several of the holes were deemed too short, and were therefore combined. The number was thereby reduced from 11 to nine, so that a complete round of the links comprised 18 holes. Due to the status of St Andrews as the golfing capital, all other courses followed suit and the 18-hole course remains the standard to the present day. Equipment development The evolution of golf can be explained by the development of the equipment used to play the game. Some of the most notable advancements in the game of golf have come from the development of the golf ball. The golf ball took on many different forms before the 1930s when the United States Golf Association (USGA) set standards for weight and size.USGA History: 1931 - 1950 These standards were later followed by a USGA regulation stating that the initial velocity of any golf ball cannot exceed 250 feet per second. Since this time, the golf ball has continued to develop and impact the way the game is played. Another notable factor in the evolution of golf has been the development of golf clubs. The earliest golf clubs were made of wood that was readily available in the area. Over the years, Hickory developed into the standard wood used for shafts and American Persimmon became the choice of wood for the club head due to its hardness and strength. As the golf ball developed and became more durable with the introduction of the \\"gutty\\" around 1850, the club head was also allowed to develop, and a variety of iron headed clubs entered the game. The introduction of steel shafts began in the late 1890s, but their adoption by the governing bodies of golf was slow. In the early 1970s, shaft technology shifted again with the use of graphite for its lightweight and strength characteristics. The first metal \\"wood\\" was developed in the early 1980s, and metal eventually completely replaced wood due to its strength and versatility.Golf Club History - Golf Club Revue The latest golf club technology employs the use of graphite shafts and lightweight titanium heads, which allows the club head to be made much larger than previously possible. The strength of these modern materials also allows the face of the club to be much thinner, which increases the spring-like effect of the club face on the ball, theoretically increasing the distance the ball travels. The USGA has recently limited the spring-like effect, also known as the Coefficient of Restitution (COR) to .83 and the maximum club head size to 460cc in an attempt to maintain the challenge of the game.Guide to the Rules on Clubs and Balls - USGA Etymology The word golf was first mentioned in writing in 1457 on a Scottish statute on forbidden games as gouf,\\"At the fut bal ande the golf be vtterly criyt done and nocht vsyt\\" , Dictionary of the Scots Language, accessed 25 April 2007 possibly derived from the Scots word goulf (variously spelled) meaning \\"to strike or cuff\\". This word may, in turn, be derived from the Dutch word kolf, meaning \\"bat\\" or \\"club\\", and the Dutch sport of the same name. The Dutch term Kolf and the Flemish term Kolven refers to a related sport where the lowest number of strokes needed to hit a ball with a mallet into a hole determines the winner; according to the \\"Le grand dictionnaire ftan√ßois-flamen printed 1643 is stated the Dutch term to Flemish: \\"Kolf, zest Kolve; Kolfdrager, Sergeant; Kolf, Kolp, Goulfe.\\" There is a persistent urban legend claiming that the term derives from an acronym \\"Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden\\". This is a false etymology, as acronyms being used as words is a fairly modern phenomenon, making the expression a backronym.See article at Snopes. J. R. R. Tolkien, a professional philologist, nodded to the derivation from the Dutch word for club in his 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit. There he mentions (tongue-in-cheek) that the game of golf was invented when a club-wielding hobbit knocked the head off a goblin named Golfimbul, and the head sailed through the air and landed in a rabbit hole. Museums The history of golf is preserved and represented at several golf museums around the world, notably the British Golf Museum in the town of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, which is the home of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, and the United States Golf Association Museum, located alongside the United States Golf Association headquarters in Far Hills, New Jersey. The World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida also presents a history of the sport, as does the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in Oakville, Ontario, and the American Golf Hall of Fame in Foxburg, Pennsylvania at the Foxburg Country Club. Museums for individual players include the Jack Nicklaus Museum in Columbus, Ohio, and rooms in the USGA Museum for Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer, and Ben Hogan.

He was sent by Finkel to move the yeshiva from Europe to Hebron in 1925, and following the 1929 Hebron massacre, to Jerusalem. In 1934, he assumed the position of rosh yeshiva. Over the years, he produced thousands of students, many of whom became prominent roshei yeshiva and rabbis in Israel and abroad. Early years Sarna was born in Horodok, Russia, on 28 Shevat in 1890. His father, Yaakov Chaim, was the city's shochet and melamed, and later its maggid. Sarna's mother, Aidel, was the daughter of Shlomo Zalman Buxenbaum, a hassid of the Chiddushei Harim, and author of Rechovos Ir, a commentary on Midrash Rabba. Sarna received his primary education from his father, as well as at the cheder in Horodok. When he was 11, he was sent to the Ohr Hachaim yeshiva in Slabodka, headed by Tzvi Levitan, a student of the Simcha Zissel Ziv, \\"the Alter of Kelm\\". During the year that he studied there, he was exposed to the musar teachings of the mashgiach, Eliyahu Laicrovits. In 1902, he journeyed to Maltsch to study under Zalman Sender Kahana-Shapiro, who also presided as the Chief Rabbi of the city. Due to an internal conflict in the yeshiva, Kahana-Shapiro left Maltsch, and transferred to Kriniki, barely a year after Sarna had arrived. Without a mentor, Sarna left Maltsch. A year later, he returned to Slabodka to study under Chaim Rabinowitz in Knesses Beis Yitzchok. In 1904, Rabinowitz invited Sarna to join a group of select students he took along with him while being transferred to the Telz Yeshiva. When the yeshiva temporarily closed in 1906, Sarna returned to Maltsch, studying under Shimon Shkop. One year later, he returned to Knesses Yisroel Yeshiva in Slabodka, where he became one of the yeshiva's best students. He drew attention of Ziv, who played a major role in his spiritual growth. Describing their special relationship, Sarna wrote, \\"Without the Alter, I would have been like a blind and a deaf person. He opened my eyes and my ears, and I acquired my entire approach to Torah study from him.\\"  World War I  With the outbreak of World War I, the entire Slabodka yeshiva fled to Minsk. Like all of the yeshiva's students, Sarna secured forged affidavits in order to avoid the draft. However, he was caught and imprisoned. He managed to escape from prison and flee to the home of a relative, Yehoshua Zimbalist. Soon after, he escaped to Smilowitz where the Chofetz Chaim and his students had taken refuge. Shortly after the Slabodka yeshiva had arrived in Minsk, which was near the battlefront, it was forced to flee to a safer city, Kremenchuk. However, Sarna chose not to join the yeshiva, but remained in Smilowitz, studying for a year and a half in an inn with the students of the Radu≈Ñ Yeshiva. During this period, he developed close relationships with the Chofetz Chaim and Radu≈Ñ's rosh yeshiva, Naftoli Trop, and later referenced this brief period as one of the most beautiful in his life. After the revolution, Sarna returned to the Knesses Yisroel yeshiva in Kremenchuk. Two years later, he married Pesha Miriam Epstein, the daughter of Moshe Mordechai Epstein, one of the yeshiva heads. Shortly after World War I, the yeshiva managed to leave Russia and to return to Slabodka, which, after the war, was re-annexed to Lithuania. At one point, Ziv asked Sarna to deliver shiurim (lectures) in the yeshiva, but he declined the offer, explaining that he preferred to devote the early years of his life to Torah study. Although Sarna held no official position in the yeshiva, his influence there was keenly felt. Palestine Knesses Yisrael yeshiva (Hebron) In 1924, following the edict requiring enlistment in the military or supplementary secular studies in the yeshiva, the decision was made to transfer the yeshiva to Eretz Yisroel. Sarna was sent to Eretz Yisroel to choose a site for the yeshiva and to coordinate its establishment there. After evaluating various options he chose the city of Hebron. Consequently, Knesses Yisroel became the first Lithuanian yeshiva to transfer to Eretz Yisroel. At that period, Sarna assumed a significant role in the yeshiva's leadership, delivering shiurim (lectures) and coordinating study schedules. In the beginning of 1927, the Alter fell seriously ill, and Sarna began to deliver musar discourses in the yeshiva. In the course of the 1929 Hebron massacre, 24 of the yeshiva's students had been killed and many were injured. Sarna succeeded in reestablishing the yeshiva in Jerusalem. He renamed it \\"Hebron\\", in memory of those who were massacred in that city. While Leib Chasman, the yeshiva's mashgiach, dedicated himself to encouraging the students, Sarna took the task of fund raising for the yeshiva, traveling extensively, even making several trips to the United States. In a letter to Isaac Sher of Slabodka, he wrote, \\"The first weeks were very difficult, since the students were both destitute and despondent. But by the 15th of Elul, they returned to themselves, and by Rosh Hashana, the yeshiva began to function in full force.\\" When his father-in-law, Moshe Mordechai, died in 1933, four years after the Hebron Massacre, Rav Yechezkel was officially appointed rosh yeshiva of Hebron. Community involvement and leadership With the start of World War II and the Holocaust, Sarna expanded the scope of his activities: he was among the founders of the Vaad Yeshivos, and was also active in the Vaad Hatzalah. After the founding of the State of Israel, Sarna served as one of the leaders of the Chinuch Atzmai Torah School Network. Although he shunned direct political involvement, Rabbi Sarna had a strong affinity for Agudas Yisroel, and he was an active member of its Council of Torah Sages. Despite the involvement in community and Jewish projects, the Hebron yeshiva and its students remained his lifework. He delivered shiurim in halacha and musar every week at the yeshiva and in his own home. For seven years, he also delivered discourses on the laws and meaning of Shabbat. In 1936, with the passing of the yeshiva's mashgiach, Yehuda Leib Chasman, Sarna assumed that role himself. As rosh yeshiva and mashgiach, he acted warmly toward his students. This attitude is apparent in one of his letters, in which he wrote, \\"Yesterday, I entered the yeshiva close to midnight, and found thirty students studying with exceptional fervor. At that time, I thought, 'Fortunate is the generation which has merited such young people. May Hashem protect them and bless them.'\\" Over time, his brothers-in-law, Rabbis Aaron Cohen and Moshe Chevroni, were appointed roshei yeshiva of Hebron, while Meir Chadash was appointed mashgiach. Later, Rabbis Hillel Paley, Simcha Zissel Broide and Avrohom Farbstein were also invited to become roshei yeshiva there. Final days In his last months, Sarna kept davening at the yeshiva and delivering shiurim. In 1969, he was taken to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital for intensive treatment. Two days before his death, he was reported to have said, \\"It is Elul and the students are surely studying with added hasmada. My illness won't disturb their Elul mood.\\" He died on 6 Elul and was buried beside his father- in-law, Moshe Mordechai Epstein, on the Mount of Olives.

The park was created on January 11, 1961 by President Juscelino Kubitschek, and listed as a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 2001. It occupies an area of in the municipalities of Alto Para√≠so de Goi√°s, Cavalcante and Colinas do Sul. The park is maintained by Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation.  History  The Chapada dos Veadeiros region was first developed around the golden mine rush in the 18th Century. Cavalcante was one of the first villages founded in the region, and at one point became one of Brazil's major gold extractors. Some reports say that Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil visited Cavalcante, making it capital of the Empire for a day. The necessity of slave labor to work the mines in the Chapada dos Veadeiros was so great that the region is now home to some of the biggest Quilombos communities in Brazil.  Kalungas  The Quilombos are communities of Afro-Brazilians who managed to escape from slavery, both from agricultural plantations and mines. The Quilombos communities of Chapada dos Veadeiros include a subgroup known as the Kalungas. The word Kalunga meant \\"something of smaller value\\" in the past. The term is now a term of pride for the Kalunga group. Their image in Brazil has grown. With the end of the golden period of mining, the Chapada dos Veadeiros had only an isolated collection of villages; they were rediscovered and engage in tourism to support Kalunga communities.  Geography  upright=1.2 Rainbow adorns the Salto II waterfall of \\"Black River\\"  Climate  The average yearly temperature is 24-26 degrees Celsius, ranging from a minimum of 4-8 degrees Celsius and reaching a maximum of 40-42 degrees Celsius.  Altitude  With altitudes between 600 and 1650 meters, it is the highest plain in Central Brazil. The highest point of the park and of the state of Goi√°s is Serra da Santana, at 1691 meters above sea level.  Rock formations  Its rock formations are one of the oldest on the planet. There are quartz with outcrops of crystals. These rocks are exported and appreciated in Japan and England, where for some decades they were used for industrial work. Nowadays therapists and nature lovers seek energies and the power to cure from the crystals and from places like Alto Paraiso. Rock crystals are present in the soil of the rich cerrado, or open pasture. Forest growth is also still found in the region, where more than 25 species of orchids can be found, besides other Brazilian species such as pau d'arco roxo, copa√≠ba (copa tree), aroeira (California pepper tree), tamanqueira (cork tree), teriv√° (a variety of palm tree), buritis (wine-palm) and Baba√ßu (Babassu). The main river in the park is the Rio Preto, a tributary of the Tocantins River. There are many waterfalls along its course such as the Rio Preto Falls (120 meters high, 80 meters at the base) and the Cariocas Falls. The park is noted for its scenic canyons, with walls of up to high and valleys of up to deep.  List of waterfalls  Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park is noted for its waterfalls. Those which range from 80 to 120 meters include the Corredeiras, Cannyon I, Cannyon II, the Carioquinhas Waterfall and the Jardim de Maitr√©ya.

Physiological adaptations to LSD training include improved cardiovascular function, improved thermoregulatory function, improved mitochondrial energy production, increased oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, and increased utilization of fat for fuel. Ernst van Aaken, a German physician and coach, is generally recognized as the founder of the long slow distance method of endurance training.Morris, Alfred F. 1984. Sports medicine: prevention of athletic injuries. University of Michigan Anderson, Bob and Joe Henderson. 1972. Guide to distance running. Indiana University. Long slow distance training is a form of continuous training performed at a constant pace of low to moderate intensity over an extended distance or duration. The moderate training intensity of LSD is effective in improving endurance and maximum oxygen uptake in individuals who are undertrained or moderately trained. Long slow distance training is thought not to be effective when used in isolation by well-trained athletes, who in order to achieve further improvements in metabolic conditioning require higher training intensities that are not sustainable at the work durations associated with LSD. History Tim Noakes, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Cape Town, suggests that it was Arthur Newton who initially proposed that running longer distances at slower paces was the most effective training method for beginning runners. Noakes asserts that after this method was rediscovered in the 1960s, Joe Henderson coined the term \\"long slow distance\\". Joe Henderson Long slow distance running was promoted as a training method by Joe Henderson in 1969. Henderson saw his approach as providing an alternative to the dominant school of training for distance running which he called ‚ÄúPTA school of running ‚Äì the pain, torture, and agony‚Äù approach. He documented the success of six competitive runners who followed in one form or another an LSD training regime, sometimes combining a few more strenuous workouts with the regular long slow distance running with weekly mileages ranging from 50-60 to 120‚Äì150 miles per week, with marathon personal bests between 2:14 and 2:50 hours. In addition, there are ultra-marathoners who use a similar method for training. A typical 5k runner might consider 8 to 10 miles of LSD, while a marathoner might run 20 or more miles. LSD runs are typically done at an easy pace, 1‚Äì3 minutes per mile slower than a runner's 10k pace. The objectives of these runs are to build blood volume and to increase muscle strength, endurance, and aerobic fitness. Henderson's book was not only directed at competitive runners, but also at runners who wanted to have fun running. He writes, ‚ÄúLSD isn't just a training method. It's a whole way of looking at the sport. Those who employ it are saying running is fun ‚Äì all running, not just the competitive part which yields rewards.‚Äù Original IntroductionHenderson would later write that he stopped using LSD as \\"misleading term\\" shortly after the publication of Long Slow Distance. (see: Henderson, Joe. Marathon Training (2003), 2nd edition, Human Kinetics, , p. 36) Approaches to running During the running boom of the 1970s, many recreational runners used LSD as a basis for training.p.1 One of the \\"fathers\\" of the Honolulu Marathon, cardiologist Jack Scaff used a long slow distance approach to train runners in his marathon clinics.The Honolulu Marathonhttp://www.honolulumarathon.org/?s=halloffame Scaff advised his runners to follow the \\"talk test\\", an idea that had originated from Arthur Lydiard in which runners should be going slow enough to be able to hold a conversation. According to sportswriter John Brant in his 2006 book Duel in the Sun, almost every serious distance runner in the early 1980s used Lydiard's system of building an endurance base with many miles at an aerobic pace before running shorter distances at an anaerobic pace. Starting out with an hour run, three times a week, and building up to weekly averages of 40 to 60 miles a week for the last three months, thousands of graduates of the program have found that they could complete the full Honolulu Marathon which is held every year in beginning of December. The clinic's approach can be seen from its original Rules of the Road, now referred to as the \\"basic set of rules that lay the foundation for your training.\\"p. 4 :The rules: :*No fewer than three runs per week :*No more than five runs per week :*No less than one hour per run :*No farther than 15 miles on any run :*One run per week lasting two hours or more (after month 5)The Honolulu Marathon Clinic offers a shorter form of the rules: :*Train for at least an hour, three times a week. :*Train no more than four times a week. :*Pass the \\"talk\\" test while training. :*Drink water every 20 minutes HMC A variant of the LSD approach is to combine running slowly with walking breaks. :\\"It has been found that average runners will have more success if they take regular walk breaks. :\\"The strategy is unusual in that it doesn't involve simply walking when you are tired. Walk-break runners force themselves to stop even at the beginning of a run when they are fresh.\\" Parker-Pope, Tara; This Jogging Method Turns Out-of-Shape Into Runners Wall Street Journal, 25 May 2007. Access date: 2007-05-25 An example of such an approach is provided by the running clinics organized by Jeff Galloway In running circles, John Bingham aka the Penguin, is a well-known practitioner of LSD combined with walking breaks.John Bingham, retrieved 2007-05-25 Limitations Arthur Lydiard wrote that LSD system of training does not reach the levels of effort most effective for building aerobic fitness. Pete Pfitzinger has written that the long slow distance method of training is acceptable for novice runners hoping to complete a marathon, but that more experienced runners benefit from long runs that, depending on the workout, incorporate a variety of paces including speeds approaching race pace. According to Pfitzinger, varying paces are necessary because different physiological adaptations, including increased glycogen storage and fat utilization, occur at specific training paces. Galloway points out that if a runner wishes to increase their speed, interval training or speed training is recommended. Henderson uses races as speedwork and is a proponent of speedwork in limited quantities. The scientific literature indicates that high-intensity training can provide greater benefit towards anaerobic capacity than moderate- intensity endurance training. The U.S. Army is reducing the use of long runs in its physical training programs.Military Playing Down Long Runs, Adopting More Diverse Fitness Programs See also * Strength training * vVO2max References  * External links * Joe Henderson * Jeff Galloway * John Bingham (The Penguin) * Honolulu Marathon Clinic Category:Aerobic exercise Category:Endurance games Category:Running ","title":"Long slow distance"},{"id":"4144196","text":"Qudrat Ullah Shahab (or Qudratullah Shahab, ; 26 February 192024 July 1986) was an eminent Urdu writer and civil servant from Pakistan.

History Front view of the HBG The Hermann-B√∂se-Gymnasium was founded in 1905 as a secondary school for boys at the instigation of the Senate of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. Therefore, HBG should notably educate a new elite in sciences and foreign languages. This tradition continues to date, as evidenced on the basis of numerous outstanding placings at various competitions and the emphasis of economics and English as major fields of study. Students are also able to participate in a number of international conferences, such as Model United Nations (MUN) and Model European Parliaments each year. In 2009, the school hosts the first MUN for middle and high school students in Bremen. Furthermore, the Hermann-B√∂se- Gymnasium is the only secondary school in Bremen, which still resides in its original building. The school itself was constructed in the style of the Weser renaissance and is today under monumental protection. The building is located very central and is close to the central station. From 1933 until 1945, the school was named after Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, a German officer who led the Schutztruppe in German East Africa successfully through World War I. This post-World War I hero today is controversially discussed, as he was also involved in the abatement of the Herero uprising in Namibia and the Kapp Putsch. Lettow-Vorbeck often held pro-colonial speeches at the school. Today the school holds a partnership with a Namibian school. Anti-colonial monument After World War II the school was named after Hermann B√∂se (1870-1943), a music teacher of the school who was deported by the Nazis. Since he was a communist, it was perceived after World War II that he could not serve as an example for students alongside greats like Goethe and Kopernikus. So it was decided to name the street after B√∂se instead, and from then on the institute was referred to as Gymnasium an der Hermann-B√∂se-Stra√üe. It was not until May 2005 that the school decided the renaming to Hermann-B√∂se-Gymnasium from August 2005, since for pupils and the public the school was long known as Hermann-B√∂se-Gymnasium for short, or rather in the shortest form HBG. In addition to this it was considered reasonable to connect the values of B√∂se like social justice, solidarity and humanity directly with the school. Across from the school there is a 7 metre high brick-elephant designed by the sculptor Fritz Behn, inaugurated on July 6, 1932, which became the emblem of the school. Just like the school the monument changed from a pro-colonial monument to an anti-colonial monument in a ceremonious renaming on May 18, 1990. The Motto of the school is seen on the facade above the main entrance and says \\"non scholae sed vitae [discimus]\\", in English \\"[we learn,] not for school, but for life\\", in its well-known inversion of the saying of Seneca \\"non vitae sed scholae discimus\\". From September 29 till October 1, 2005 the school celebrated its centenary. Building The Charlottenburger architect group had won the contest for the construction of a Realgymnasium in Bremen. The school building was constructed according to their plans from 1903 to 1906. On April 19, 1906 the school first opened its doors to students. The building outlasted World War II relatively undamaged. In 1977 it was the first school building in Bremen to be put under monumental protection, which turned out to be one reason - among others - not to give up the school location Hermann-B√∂se-Stra√üe from 1988 to 1989. There are four small statues located above the main entrance. One of them shows Goethe and another one Copernicus. The other two statues represent science and cosmopolitanism.

Originally built around 1610, it is often referred to as the oldest church in the United States (excluding Puerto Rico), though it is likely that little of the original structure is still present. The church was rebuilt twice, once in the mid to late 17th century, and again in 1710 following the Pueblo Revolt. In both cases earlier pieces of the building may have been reused, though it is unclear to what extent. The wooden reredos, which includes a wooden statue of Saint Michael dating back to at least 1709, was added in 1798. The church is a contributing property in the Barrio De Analco Historic District, which is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. and As of 2020, weekly Mass is still offered at the chapel on Sundays. History The church as it appeared in the early 1870s San Miguel Mission in 1904, after being remodeled in the 1880s The original San Miguel church was probably built shortly after the founding of Santa Fe in 1610 and was the first church in the new settlement. It was built across the Santa Fe River from the villa proper in an area referred to as the Barrio de Analco, which was inhabited mainly by native people including some Tlaxcalans who had accompanied the Spanish settlers from Mexico. Since missionary work was a priority for the Spaniards, they built a church to serve this population before building their own Parroquia or parish church near the Plaza. In 1630, Alonso de Benavides reported, The San Miguel mission was first mentioned in writing in 1628, indicating it was in use at that point. Although intended as a mission, the Spanish also used it as their parish church until the Parroquia was completed. The original San Miguel church was probably smaller than the present structure, with a rectangular apse, a slightly raised sanctuary, and a simple front elevation with no towers. The surviving foundations were excavated and studied by Bruce Ellis and Stanley Stubbs in 1955. In 1640, escalating conflict between Governor Luis de Rosas and the Franciscan missionaries who ran the church in New Mexico led to all of the Franciscans being expelled from Santa Fe, and the mission was partially or completely dismantled. De Rosas was later jailed and the Franciscans were able to return and rebuild the mission. It was damaged again in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, when the Pueblo people rose up in a coordinated rebellion to drive the Spanish from New Mexico. When Diego de Vargas led the Spanish back into Santa Fe in 1692, he found the mission burned but reparable. According to his official report, dated December 18, 1693, According to L. Bradford Prince, the repairs \\"were probably hasty and temporary\\". A more thorough rebuilding was undertaken in 1710 under the direction of Don Agust√≠n Flores Vergara, who is named on the main beam supporting the choir loft along with the governor at the time, the Marquis de la Pe√±uela. The church was probably rebuilt on the same foundations and had the same layout as the earlier building, except that the apse was apparently changed from rectangular to trapezoidal. San Miguel was visited in 1776 by Fray Atanasio Dom√≠nguez, who wrote a thorough description: At some point after Dom√≠nguez' visit, possibly in the 1830s, the present bell tower was added to the front of the church. By the time of the American occupation in 1846, masses were being held in the church only twice a year. The top levels of the tower collapsed during a storm in 1872 and by the 1880s the entire structure was in poor condition. In 1881, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe sold the little-used building to the Christian Brothers who operated the adjacent St. Michael's College. Under their ownership, the church was restored in 1887, rebuilding the bell tower and stabilizing the walls with stone buttresses. This project gave the building a more European appearance, adding arched openings and a pitched metal roof to the front elevation. These elements were later removed in 1955 during the most recent remodeling of the church. The church interior with part of the inscribed choir loft beam visible at the top Architecture San Miguel Mission is constructed from adobe, with a single rectangular nave and a trapezoidal apse. The walls are approximately thick. The church interior is about wide, long, and high. The ceiling is supported by wooden vigas, of which two are square and are thought to date to 1710, while the remainder are round and are newer replacements. A clerestory above the sanctuary and a high window in the south wall provide light inside the church. The choir loft is supported by a heavy, corbeled beam spanning the width of the nave which in turn supports 13 perpendicular carved beams. The main beam is inscribed: The front elevation of the church faces west and has a central bell tower with a single small window and a larger open void directly above the main entrance. The building is supported by five stone buttresses added in 1887, two on the front and three on the north side. To the south of the nave are a sacristy, robing room, and storage and residence areas. Reredos The reredos, dated 1798 The wooden reredos or altar screen dates to 1798 and is said to be the work of an unnamed artisan known as the \\"Laguna Santero\\" who was active in New Mexico between 1796 and 1808. The screen is flanked by large Solomonic columns. A niche in the center of the reredos, with its own small pair of columns, contains a wooden statue of St. Michael the Archangel wielding a sword. The statue originated in Mexico in 1709 and has been in place at least since 1776, when it was mentioned in Dom√≠nguez' inventory of the church. Directly above the statue is a large painting of Jesus from the mid-18th century which was found behind the altar screen during the 1955 renovations. At the top center is a 1745 painting of St. Michael attributed to Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco. Around these two paintings are four oval oil paintings on canvas, which are Mexican and date to the early 18th century. Clockwise from top left, they depict St. Teresa of √Åvila, St. Gertrude, St. Louis, and St. Francis of Assisi. The entire reredos was painted over at some point but was later restored. On either side of the reredos are two paintings depicting the Annunciation, \\"believed to be the work of one of the disciples of Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo\\". In the early 20th century, these paintings were falsely attributed to Cimabue and claimed to date from 1287. The San Miguel bell Bell Another notable object associated with the church is the bell that hung in the bell tower prior to 1872, which is still on display inside the building. The bell is mostly copper, weighs , and bears the legend The unlikely date of 1356 attracted attention from historians and the public. The San Miguel bell and the similar Maria Josefa bell, dated 1355, were claimed to be the oldest bells in the United States. This was debunked in 1914 by Benjamin Read, who located an elderly man who remembered the bell being cast in Santa Fe and confirmed that the correct date was 1856, not 1356. Furthermore, the bell is stylistically dissimilar to actual 14th century church bells, which would have been inscribed in Latin and dated using Roman numerals. The unlikelihood of two such large and heavy bells being brought from Europe when locally made bells were available has also been noted. Casting defects were probably responsible for the 8 appearing as a 3.

Towards Sinai) was an Israeli settlement in the north of the Gaza Strip. Founding Elei Sinai was established in 1982 (Sukkot 5743) by a group who had been evicted from Yamit in the Sinai Peninsula. It was named for the yearning to return to the Sinai desert, where Yamit was located. Avi Farhan, a Yamit expellee, and Arik Herfez, whose daughter had been killed by Palestinian militants, were two of the most notable residents. Unilateral Disengagement Residents of Elei Sinai camping in Yad Mordechai, just over the border from their former homes. Among the arguments in opposition to Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, which stated that the settlers should be evicted from Elei Sinai, was a proposal by Farhan allowing the settlers to remain in their homes as Palestinian citizens, an idea the Palestinians the Israeli government rejected. The residents had actually left their homes voluntarily but returned after realizing that the government had no place to send them. After the eviction, a group of fifty families established themselves at the Yad Mordechai junction as a protest that the government hadn't found a community solution for them. Others were sent to the Shirat HaYam hotel. The rest of the settlement later split into a few groups, including those now found in: *Karmia, who were promised future homes in Talmei Yafeh close to Ashkelon. *Or HaNer, who were promised future homes in the Bat Hadar neighborhood close to Ashkelon. Farhan and a part of his family establish a new group and hope to establish a new community in the center of the country. The government agreed in 2006 to acclimatize this group in Palmachim.

Members of the International Socialists participated in the foundation of the VSC, but for the first year of its existence its presence was a token one only. It organised a demonstration of 20,000 people in October 1967 that for the first time ignored police warnings not to enter Grosvenor Square, where the United States Embassy in London was then located. In March and October 1968 two major demonstrations in London, sponsored by the VSC, drew more than 100,000 participants. Serious police violence was captured by press and television cameras during the March protest. The October demonstration was carefully planned to avoid any opportunity for a repeat performance, resulting in a peaceful march of 200,000 people across London. According to its newsletter, VSC branches were active in many British cities -- Glasgow, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham and Swansea. Even small towns, including Falkirk and Northold Park, counted VSC members. The Vietnam Solidarity Campaign consistently badgered Harold Wilson and his government over Vietnam. Every issue of the VSC Bulletin contained a special section on \\"British Complicity\\" in the war, usually focusing on military R&D; carried on by industry and universities. In its Vietnam Handbook (1972) the VSC devoted a major chapter to \\"British Complicity,\\" accusing Wilson of cutting a \\"shabby figure\\" as he consistently supported U.S. policy in Vietnam.

He invented the first sensitive barometer, a key enabler of instrument flight in airplanes. The United States Patent Office cites him as the inventor on 124 patents. Kollsman studied engineering and science in Stuttgart and Munich. In 1923 he emigrated from Germany to the United States, following his younger brother Ernest Otto Kollsman, who had emigrated earlier. He worked as a truck driver or truck driver's assistant until he found a position at Pioneer Instruments Co. in Brooklyn, New York, where he learned to make various aircraft instruments. He left Pioneer in 1928 and with $500 saved while working, Paul and his brother Otto founded Kollsman Instruments Co. in Brooklyn NY. In 1929 US Army Lt. James H. Doolittle was leading the development of equipment and methods for instrument flying, under the sponsorship of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. He learned of a new altimeter design submitted to the Bureau of Standards by Paul Kollsman, and arranged a meeting. On August 30, 1929, Doolittle and Kollsman took the altimeter on a test flight in a Vought O2U, a two seat biplane, with Kollsman holding the altimeter in his lap. Doolittle said the altimeter \\"performed perfectly\\", with accuracy an order of magnitude better than other altimeters of the day. Harry Guggenheim stated the accuracy as 10 feet. [GUGG] Doolittle had a Kollsman altimeter installed in a Consolidated NY-2 biplane, and on September 24, 1929 flew two instrument flights of 10 to 15 minutes duration at Mitchel Field on Long Island, the first flight in fog, the second using a hood after the fog lifted. A short time later the Kollsman company received an order from the U.S. Navy for 300 altimeters, their first commercial success. Subsequent models were modified to allow the pilot to easily set a local altimeter setting, shown in the \\"Kollsman window\\". By the mid-1930s Kollsman altimeters dominated the aircraft market. In 1940 the Kollsman Instrument Company was sold to Square D Company of Detroit for over $4,000,000. Paul became a Square D vice president in charge of the Kollsman Instrument division. Otto, who had been the company treasurer and controller, retired after the sale, and died on August 12, 1942. After the merger Paul Kollsman and Square D president F. W. Magin gave $50,000 to the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences in New York to establish the Paul Kollsman Library. The Institute, an ancestor of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), claimed that this was the most complete private aeronautical library in the United States. They offered to loan books by mail for the price of postage to anyone requesting them. In 1951 Square D sold the Kollsman division to Standard Coil Products Co. of Chicago, a maker of TV tuners, for over $5,000,000. Standard Coil named long time Kollsman general manager Victor Carbonara as vice president of the division, implying that Paul Kollsman left the company after this sale. In 1940 he purchased of land outside Manchester, Vermont from International Paper Company, and founded Snow Valley, which formally opened in January 1942, and was one of the earliest ski areas in the United States. Snow Valley operated continuously until 1984, and in 1983 hosted the first U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships ‚Äî now held annually at Stratton Vermont. Snow Valley is being redeveloped as a private sporting community. In 1944 Kollsman married Baroness Julie \\"Luli\\" Dorothea Baronin von Bodenhausen, an actress and author, in New York City; she died in 1951. In 1952 he married his second wife, Eva F. Kollsman, who survived him. Paul Kollsman died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California in 1982. Estate In 1945 Kollsman purchased The Enchanted Hill, a fabulous estate in Beverly Hills, California, which contained a Mediterranean Revival main house of 10,000 square feet with of formal gardens, which Mr. Kollsman eventually augmented to , designed by acclaimed architect Wallace Neff. The estate, which was described by architectural historian Sam Watters as \\"fantastical\\", had been built in 1925 at the top of Angelo Drive by MGM screenwriter Frances Marion and her cowboy- star husband, Frederick Clifton Thomson. Among other features, the estate included a mahogany-floored stable for Thomson's horse \\"Silver King\\". It was considered one of the finest estates in all of Los Angeles, was called a \\"poetic hilltop paradise, a timeless homage to the natural beauty that was once Los Angeles.\\" Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen acquired the estate from Kollsman's widow, Eva, in 1997 for $20 million and razed the landmark house in 2000, with plans to build two mansions in its place. the site remains undeveloped, overgrown with brush and weeds.

Mackintosh opened up his sweets shop in Halifax, Yorkshire, England in 1890, and the idea for Mackintosh's Toffee, not too hard and not too soft, came soon after. In 1969, Mackintosh's merged with rival Rowntree to form Rowntree Mackintosh, which merged with Nestl√© in 1988. The product is often credited with being over 100 years old. The toffee is sold in bags containing a random assortment of individual wrapped flavoured toffees. The flavours are (followed by wrapping colour): Malt (Blue), Harrogate (Yellow), Mint (Green), Egg & Cream (Orange), Coconut (Pink), and Toffee (Maroon). The maroon wrapped toffees do not display a flavour on the wrapper. The product's subtitle is \\"Toffee De Luxe\\" and its motto \\"a tradition worth sharing\\". The flavour Harrogate was originally developed by confectioners in the spa town of Harrogate in Yorkshire to remove the pungent taste of the town's spa waters.'Toffee firm chews on discovery of rival brand Down Under' on The Northern Echo website, dated 2000-09-02 and viewed 2013-01-05 Availability Canada had its own version of Mackintosh's Toffee. Unlike the British versions, it was a hard candy which, for most of its history, was sold as a single rectangular bar in a tartan box. More recently (circa 2008) the Canadian product is individually wrapped and manufactured in Switzerland by Nestl√©, and licensed for sale in Canada by Nestl√© Canada. However, the wrapped version is soft and more akin to a caramel. Recently (2013) Nestl√© Canada has been distributing an apparent recreation of the hard Mack bar, though thinner and wrapped in foil. It contains sweetened condensed milk as a main flavouring and has less of the creamy butter flavour of the original Canadian Mack.

It is the fifth game in the Thunder Force series. Unlike previous games in the series, Thunder Force V uses polygons to model the larger enemy ships and some of the scenery, in addition to sprites. In 1998, Thunder Force V was ported to the PlayStation as Thunder Force V: Perfect System. Gameplay The Gauntlet fighting an enemy in the second level. Thunder Force V is a horizontal-scrolling shooter video game. It is presented from a 2.5D perspective, with environments rendered in 3D and gameplay taking place on a 2D plane. The player controls a starship named the Gauntlet in its mission to destroy the Guardian, a supercomputer that became rogue after deciphering the code of a space vessel. There are seven levels total, and the first three can be selected in any order. Levels scroll automatically, and the player is given free movement. Its gameplay is similar to its predecessor, Thunder Force IV; players must destroy constantly-moving formations of enemies and dodge their projectiles and incoming obstacles. A boss concludes the end of a stage. As in previous Thunder Force games, the player has a special weapon named the \\"CRAW\\" that emits additional firepower and absorbs enemy shots. Thunder Force V allows for three CRAWs to be used instead of two like its predecessors, and will remain on the screen for a finite period of time that allows the player to recollect them. The CRAWs can also be combined with the player's currently-selected weapon to create a more powerful version of it called an \\"Over Weapon\\". Over Weapons can be used for a limited amount of time before they revert to their original state. Creating Over Weapons uses up the CRAW's energy, which is indicated by its change in color. Energy can be replenished by collecting additional CRAWs or by waiting for them to recharge. Release Thunder Force V was released in Japan for the Sega Saturn on July 11, 1997. There were two retail versions, the normal pack, and a special pack which contained a remix music CD of various Thunder Force music entitled Best of Thunder Force, which was later released separately. The Saturn version was never released outside Japan. Sega Europe took a preproduction version under consideration, and decided against publishing the game. Electronic Gaming Monthly urged readers to tell Sega of America to release the game in the United States, but it was never released there either. Thunder Force V was ported to the PlayStation and released in 1998 as Thunder Force V: Perfect System. It was published in North America by Working Designs under the SPAZ label. The PlayStation version features additional levels, high-resolution artwork, CG rendered movie sequences, and a time attack mode. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Gameplay is beyond idiotic, but at least it is difficult. If there is a saving grace here, then it is this: Thunderforce takes you back to a time when games weren't as good as they are now.\\" James Mielke from GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a review score of 8.2/10, stating, \\"easily as good as Raystorm or G-Darius and tough competition for Einhander, Thunder Force V is a shooting fan's dream.\\" Japanese gaming publication Famitsu gave the Sega Saturn version a 28 out of 40, and the PlayStation version a 31 out of 40 score. Retrospectively in 2007, Rob Fahey of Eurogamer said that while it wasn't nearly as refined or \\"utterly fantastic\\" as Einh√§nder or Radiant Silvergun, Thunder Force V was still a good shooter with well-implemented mechanics. Fahey particularly praised the CRAW for being the game's \\"hook\\", and also liked its level design and \\"perfectly- tuned\\" boss fights. He described it as being: \\"A very solid shooter, in other words, which deserved far more credit than it received - not least because any shooter with bosses called Deep Purple and Iron Maiden is alright in our book\\". In 2010, Hardcore Gaming 101s Paul Brownlee said that Thunder Force V had a great soundtrack and good gameplay, but was slightly hindered by visuals and 3D models that didn't age well. He argued that one of the game's strong points was its boss fights for their cool-looking designs and accompanying music tracks, some of which are based on those from previous Thunder Force games. Brownlee compared the two versions of the game, and claimed that neither of them were better than the other; he said that while the Saturn version had more detailed backdrops and the PlayStation version had better textures, neither of them had good graphics in the long run.

Victim studies may be carried out at a national or local level. Victim studies are canvasses of the public which request them to report any crimes which they have experienced, whether or not they have reported them. This is one of the main ways in which the dark figure of crime is exposed particularly in cases of abuse. Such surveys usually show the level of criminal activity is at least double that which appears in the official crime statistics. Victimisation surveys are usually of two types: *National survey - of a whole country in which people are asked to provide information on crimes which have been perpetrated against them. The British Crime Survey and the United States National Crime Victimization Survey are examples. * Area or neighbourhood surveys - in which a specific, usually inner city, neighbourhood is targeted, and criminologists or sociologists engage in a more detailed study of the same issues. These small scale victim studies have been particularly associated with Left Realist criminology. For example, victim studies have been carried out in Islington in London by Jock Young, revealing a fear of crime amongst local residents that shapes much of their behaviour. There is a third type of survey: The International Crime Victim Survey (ICVS) is a programme of standardised sample surveys to look at householders‚Äô experience with crime, policing, crime prevention and feelings of unsafety in a large number of countries. International comparison is the main aim for this project. A criticism of victim surveys is that there is no way of verifying information given by respondents.

Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as \\"Shahid Awwal\\" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner. Life He was born in 734 A.H (ca. 1334 ) in Jabal 'Amel. When Mohammad bin Makki was 16 years old he went to study at al-Hilla in Iraq. He returned home when he was 21. He used taqiyya to establish himself as one of the religious scholars of Damascus, using Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging the Shia using Shia law. Death He was killed on Thursday the ninth of Jumada al-awwal, 786 A.H. (ca. 1385) during the reign of Sultan Barquq. His death was in accordance with the fatwa of a jurist from the Maliki madhab, which was endorsed by a jurisprudent of the Shaf'i madhab. Accusations against him included rafd, defamation of senior Islamic personages, the companions and family of the Prophet Muhammad Aisha, Abu Bakr and Umar, following the Nusayri faith, and permitting the drinking of wine. These accusations were first brought against him by two of his former students from Jabal Amil, who were also former Twelver Shiites. One of them, Yusuf ibn Yahya, submitted a report (which included the signatures of 70 former Shiites from Jabal Amil) to the authorities detailing al-Amili's \\"vile doctrines and abominable beliefs.\\" However, according to Shia biographer al- Khwansari, al-Amili denied these charges in a letter to the governor of Damascus, protesting his love for \\"the Prophet and all who loved him, all the Companions without exception.\\" He was imprisoned for one year, then beheaded by sword.

Bowers purchased and moved the paper to Canon, Georgia, and remained as publishing editor to 1911. From 1911 to 1991, it continued to be published in Canon, Georgia, under an arrangement with the Georgia Universalist Convention, serving as a regional oriented periodical. There was a succession of local editors, notably Nellie Mann Opdale, Argyle E. Houser, and Haynie Summers. Then it began to shift its focus away from regional interests with editor William Balkan from 1985 to 1991, followed by Vernon Chandler and then Justin Lapoint.

Silver Lake, sometimes Silverlake, is an unincorporated community in Cowlitz County, Washington, in the southwestern portion of the state. Silver Lake is located east of Castle Rock along Washington State Route 504, which is also known as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway. The area considered Silverlake is about east of Interstate 5 (I-5) and is approximately from Portland, Oregon, to the south and Seattle about to the north. The closest cities to the subject property are Castle Rock, six miles (10 km) to the west, and Toutle, four miles (6 km) east. The Silver Lake community takes its name from the lake of the same name, which it lies on the northwest shore of. The Silver Lake community is part of the Toutle Lake School District, a K-12 school district of about 600 students. Silver Lake is about west of Mount St. Helens and near the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, which lies at the end of the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway. The eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980 was the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States. The WDFW has planted Grass Carp in this lake, however it is illegal to fish for or retain grass carp.http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/washington/755/ Silverlake also describes the associated marsh. It is home to a nature trail, and the visitor center for the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Geography Silver Lake is located at . Economy Employment in the area is primarily centered on the cities of Longview, Kelso, and Castle Rock, which are all situated along the Interstate-5 freeway. The area in general relies on an economy that is largely based around the timber and tourism industry, but tourism has taken precedence since the declining timber industry. Local economic growth has remained stable due to the plethora of outdoor activities take place in the scenic Silverlake area, including camping, hunting, and fishing. Additionally, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 90 minutes west and skiing and other wilderness activities are all within an hour away. Transport Silverlake is served by one major road, Spirit Lake Memorial Highway, which joins I-5 in Castle Rock to the west and runs east to the US Forest Services‚Äô Mount Saint Helens Observatory at Johnston Ridge. This highway is a two-directional arterial heading west and east with both residential and commercial development areas running alongside it. Major shopping, dining and commercial properties are located up and down the I-5 corridor. Services Silverlake is not an incorporated town, but relies primarily on Castle Rock and the town of Toutle for schools and services. Cowlitz County provides most services including police, fire, ambulance, water, sewer, and garbage. Gas service is provided by Cascade Natural Gas while CenturyLink and Frontier Communications provide telephone service. The area is composed of a mixture of uses that range from single- family and multi-family residential, commercial, retail, and agricultural uses. Traffic volume along Silver Lake remains consistent with approximately 1,000 cars passing it per day. Lake The lake itself is in size and camping is available at Seaquest State Park, which occupies along of the lakeshore.

The arena opened in 1962 and at one time held 9,500 people for home games. It was home to the Syracuse Orange men's and women's basketball teams, the indoor track team, and the women's volleyball team before the Carrier Dome opened in 1980. It is named for Dr. George L. Manley, a University trustee and graduate of the College of Medicine, who was the benefactor of the building. It was built to replace the old Archbold Gymnasium, which had served for almost 60 years prior. Manley Field House hosted the ECAC Upstate Region Tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1976 as well as a semifinal game of the 1977 ECAC South Region Tournament.Varsity Pride: ECAC Men's Basketball TournamentsVarsity Pride: 1976 ECAC Men's Basketball TournamentsVarsity Pride: 1977 ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments  Renovations  On February 13, 1980, the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team defeated No. 2 Syracuse 52-50 in the final game played in Manley. After the victory, Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr. said that \\"Manley Field House is officially closed\\". In the 1990s, Syracuse University developed a new football wing on Manley. The football world was a large complex with a Hall of Fame Gallery at its center. The facility was designed by a Syracuse alumni Lawrence C. Apgar, Architect. On September 26, 2007, ground was broken for the new Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center, which houses practice courts, weight rooms, locker rooms and offices for both the men's and women's basketball teams. This freed up Manley Field House, which was the practice facility for the teams. For the 2007-2008 season, the women's basketball team played all of its home games in the Carrier Dome for the first time. With basketball out of Manley Field House, the arena was converted into an indoor practice facility for football and men's and women's lacrosse. Due to the climate of Syracuse, the University had lost a recruiting edge to other schools with newer football facilities. The field house was retrofitted with Field Turf and provided practice space for outdoor teams, which usually fight for space (usually only half of a field) in the Carrier Dome in late winter/early spring when the basketball court is still set up. Full glass windows were installed and seating was removed, creating room for nearly a full-sized football field. The entrance to the sports complex was upgraded to create a sleek new look, joining the new basketball with the renovated field house and the Iocolano- Petty Football Complex. On January 27, 2008, a temporary AstroTurf-like \\"carpet\\" was installed to provide practice space for the outdoor teams until the permanent installation took place.

Haplogroup R is associated with the peopling of Eurasia after about 70,000 years ago, and is distributed in modern populations throughout the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Haplogroup R is a descendant of the macro-haplogroup N. Among the R clade's descendant haplogroups are B, U (and thus K), F, R0 (and thus HV, H, and V), and JT (the ancestral haplogroup of J and T). Origin Soares et al. (2009) estimate the age of haplogroup R to (95% CI), that is, between roughly 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, with a most likely age near about 65,000 years. This is consistent with an emergence in the course of the Coastal Migration out of East Africa to West, South and Southeast Asia. It has been suggested that the early lineage of haplogroups M, N and R along the coastal route during the period of roughly 70,000 to 60,000 years ago. Haplogroup R has wide diversity and antiquity in the indigenous population of South Asia. Tribes and castes of Western and Southern India show higher diversity than the other regions, possibly suggesting their autochthonous status. Larruga et al. (2017) found mtDNA R spread out to Eurasia and Australia from a core area along the Southeast Asian coast. The Ust'-Ishim man fossil of Siberia, dated ca. 45,000 years old, belongs to haplogroup R* (formerly classified as U*). Distribution Haplogroup R and its descendants are distributed all over Australasia, Americas, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, East Asia, Europe, North Africa and Horn of Africa. The basal R* clade is found among the Soqotri (1.2%), as well as in Northeast Africa (1.5%), the Middle East (0.8%), the Near East (0.8%), and the Arabian peninsula (0.3%). Haplogroup R has also been observed among ancient Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, which date from the Pre-Ptolemaic/late New Kingdom, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods.

In the late 1940s, USAF Major Generals Laurence C. Craigie, deputy chief of staff for development, and Orval R. Cook, deputy chief of staff for materiel, proposed that new designs should move directly into the production phase without the construction of prototypes. Since then, this approach has been used in an increasing number of aviation projects. Traditional aircraft design follows a time-honored formula. After the design drawings (or \\"blueprints\\") are prepared, a small series of prototype aircraft are constructed in order to test the concept. Data from the flight tests influences the revisions that are made to the design. If these changes are wide-ranging and/or significant, more prototypes will need to be built. Once the prototype cycle is complete, the development can enter the \\"pre- production\\" stage and further evaluation. Once this stage is completed satisfactorily, series production can begin. The Cook‚ÄìCraigie plan promoted the elimination of the entire prototype cycle and entering straight into the pre-production stage. If these examples flew as expected, production could start immediately. The plan required considerable confidence in the design from the outset; if the design had an inherent flaw, the jigs used during pre- production would have to be replaced. The plan seems inherently more risky than the traditional prototype cycle, but Cook and Craigie pointed out that for the advanced designs that were entering service in the late 1940s, any prototype was likely to be so different from the production variant that any data collected could be entirely misleading. Moreover, since several aircraft designs are typically ordered for competitive testing, the chance that all of the designs would fail is extremely low, and if even one design passes testing, it can immediately enter production. One of the first designs to use the plan was the F-102 Delta Dagger. Although this design had a number of new features, it was based to a large degree on the earlier XF-92 prototype, and thus considered to be a fairly \\"well understood\\" design. This confidence proved to be misplaced, as the F-102 underwent a lengthy series of upgrades, and was eventually replaced in service by a redesigned version, the F-106 Delta Dart. Another example of the Cook‚ÄìCraigie method is the development of the Avro CF-105 Arrow, which passed through the testing phase with few required changes. As the potential of computer-aided design has increased since the 1950s, aircraft designs have generally performed much closer to their original goals. For example, the production specification of the Boeing 777 was within 20 lb of its predicted weight. Today the Cook‚ÄìCraigie plan is so common that it no longer even has a name.

Korab, ONL (born November 28, 1979 in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland) is a Canadian curler and politician. Korab was the lead for the gold medal- winning Canadian men's team at the 2006 Winter Olympics skipped by Brad Gushue. In the 2017 Newfoundland and Labrador municipal elections, Korab was elected to St. John's City Council representing Ward 3. Career Korab played in two Canadian Junior Curling Championships and three Briers before playing at the Olympics. At the 1997 Canadian Juniors, he played as a third for Randy Turpin. At the 2000 Canadian Juniors, he joined up Gushue as his second and they went all the way to the junior finals that year, losing to British Columbia's Brad Kuhn in the final. It was his last year as juniors, so he had to leave the team, but rejoined them for the 2003 Nokia Brier. He would play as Gushue's second once again at the 2004 Nokia Brier and moved back to his lead at the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier. In 2005, the team added two-time world champion Russ Howard at second, which gave them a victory at the Canadian Olympic trials and a berth to the 2006 Olympic Games, where they won the gold medal, defeating Finland's Markku Uusipaavalniemi 10‚Äì4 in the final. On April 5, 2007, it was officially announced that Korab was cut from the Gushue rink during a team meeting the night before. The move was said to be due to a team chemistry issue and not reflective of his curling ability. According to an interview aired on NTV news on April 5, 2007, there is speculation on Korab's part that the move may have been at least somewhat motivated by a verbal exchange between Korab and skip Brad Gushue some time before. It is also possible there was an issue between Korab and Chris Schille, the team's new second as of the beginning of the 2006‚Äì07 season. For the 2007‚Äì08 curling season, Korab played second on a team consisting of Olympic teammate Mike Adam, Ryan LeDrew and Mark Noseworthy. In April 2008, Brad Gushue announced that Korab would once again be a part of his team for the 2008‚Äì09 curling season. In 2010, after two seasons with Gushue, winning a Grand Slam of Curling and finishing a disappointing 4th at the 2009 & 2010 Briers, Korab decided to take some time off from curling. He helped to coach Heather Strong's rink from St. John's from the 2010‚Äì13 season. The team won the NL provincials and participated in the 2012 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Red Deer. Korab's wife (Stephanie) was also on that team. Korab was brought on to be Gushue's alternate at the 2013 Tim Hortons Brier and the 2014 Tim Hortons Brier. Politics In 2013, Korab ran for the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador's nomination in the riding of Carbonear-Harbour Grace for a by- election held there. Before the by-election was held, Korab withdrew from the race.http://www.cbncompass.ca/News/Local/2013-10-16/article-3429409/Contenders- cant-run-in-Carbonear-Harbour-Grace-byelection/1 In 2017, Korab announced his intention to run in the upcoming St. John's municipal election to represent Ward 3 of the city on the St. John's City Council.http://vocm.com/news/jamie- korab-announces-campaign-for-ward-3-councillor/ He was easily elected, winning 63% of the vote. Personal life Korab attended St. Francis High School. He is currently a Real Estate Agent with RE/MAX in St. John's. Korab is married to Stephanie Korab, and the couple had their first child in 2013. It was the birth of his child that motivated Korab to step back from full-time professional curling in order to spend more time with family. Korab is involved with many charities and currently sits on the board of directors for Kids Eat Smart.

The gap in official statistics is largest for less serious crimes. Comparisons between official statistics, such as the Uniform Crime Reports and the National Incident-Based Reporting System, and victim studies, such as the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), attempt to provide an insight into the amount of unreported crime.

When making certain types of transactions, such as purchasing real property, motor vehicles and other items that require title, the seller usually requires a guarantee that the payment method used will satisfy the obligations. To do this, the seller will require certified funds, usually in the form of: *Certified check *cashier's check (known as a bank draft in Canada) *money order (usually with proper identification) *manager's check (usually with proper identification) *EFT wire transfer (i.e. Western Union) Specifically, personal checks are not allowed, as the account may not have sufficient funds, and credit cards are not allowed, as the transaction may later be disputed or reversed. Checks sent by a bank bill payment service where funds are removed from the sender's account before the check is sent are in an ambiguous category since the recipient may not be notified that the funds are certified. An example is Chase Billpay service. Sometimes steps may be taken to ensure that certified funds cannot easily be forged. These steps can include various unique stamps, inks and hole punchers, as well as the assistance of a machine such as a protectograph. Unfortunately these steps cannot prevent someone from erasing the payee's name and writing in their own name.

Its original title was Dans un Caf√©, a name often used today. Other early titles were A sketch of a French Caf√© and Figures at Caf√©. Then, when exhibited in London in 1893, the title was changed to L'Absinthe, the name by which the painting is now commonly known. It is in the permanent collection of the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Description Painted in 1875‚Äì76, the work portrays a woman and man sitting side-by-side, drinking a glass of absinthe. They appear lethargic and lonely. The man, wearing a hat, looks to the right off the edge of the canvas, while the woman, dressed more formally in fashionable dress and hat, stares vacantly downward. A glass filled with absinthe is on the table in front of her. The models used in the painting are Ellen Andr√©e, an actress who also appeared in √âdouard Manet's paintings Chez le p√®re Lathuille and Plum Brandy, and Marcellin Desboutin, a painter and etcher. The caf√© where they are taking their refreshment is the Caf√© de la Nouvelle-Ath√®nes in Paris. Reception At its first showing in 1876, the picture was panned by critics, who called it ugly and disgusting. It was put into storage until being exhibited again in 1892, but was again treated with derision. The painting was shown again at the Grafton Gallery in England in 1893, this time entitled L'Absinthe, where it sparked even greater controversy. The people and the absinthe represented in the painting were considered by English critics to be shockingly degraded and uncouth. Many regarded the painting as a blow to morality; this was the general view of such Victorians as Sir William Blake Richmond and Walter Crane when shown the painting in London. That reaction was typical of the age, revealing the deep suspicion with which Victorian England had regarded art in France since the early days of the Barbizon School, and the desire to find a morally uplifting lesson in works of art. Many English critics viewed the picture as a warning lesson against absinthe, and the French in general. The comment by George Moore on the woman depicted was: \\"What a whore!\\" He added, \\"the tale is not a pleasant one, but it is a lesson\\". However, in his book Modern Painting, Moore regretted assigning a moral lesson to the work, claiming that \\"the picture is merely a work of art, and has nothing to do with drink or sociology.\\"George Moore, Modern Painting (London: Walter Scott Publishing, 1898), p. 269.

It is located in coastal Provence on the Mediterranean Sea from Toulon and from Marseille. It can be reached from Paris by TGV train in less than four hours. In high season there are direct flights to nearby Toulon from London, Oslo, Brussels and Rotterdam. Overview The seafront location was part of the commune of Ollioules. In the 16th century the seigneur established a fishing village here, clustered around the medieval watchtower, under the protection of \\"Sanct Nazari\\" of L√©rins Abbey. The port was constructed and the harbor deepened in the mid-16th century. The little fishing port known in the Proven√ßal dialect of Occitan (or in Proven√ßal if considered as a distinct language) as Sant Nazari, later Sant N√†ri, contracted later on as San√†ri, was finally granted its independence from Ollioules by Louis XIV of France on 10 July 1688, and on 12 November 1890 officially received its Francized name, Sanary, which was formalized and distinguished as sur-Mer on 27 July 1923. As a tourist rendezvous, the village underwent a strong decade of growth in the 1980s. Sanary's coastline has a number of small beaches and, unlike most small towns on the Mediterranean coast, it is an active village all year round. Sanary- sur-Mer is one of the sunniest places in France, with an average of only 61 days of rain, mostly in winter, and solar radiation (6156 MJ/m2/yr), comparable to Sicily. Sanary is regularly swept by the Mistral, a strong wind coming from the Rhone Valley, which brings low humidity around 20%, gusts up to , cool temperatures, sun and deep blue skies. Wind is near gale force or higher on average 115 days per year, and storm force eight days per year, making Sanary a favorite destination for windsurfers. Main sights *Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Piti√©: From this chapel built in 1560 on a headland west of the town, the visitor sees a broad view over the bay of Sanary. It has a large number of ex-voto votive offerings. *√âglise Saint Nazaire: A Gothic Revival church of the late 19th century, Michel Pacha, architect. *Tour romane: A medieval construction, circa 1300. *Port: Sanary has a large collection of traditional wooden fishing boats, mainly the local \\"pointus\\". It also has a small fleet of artisan fishermen, who sell their catch every morning. *Portissol: The nicest beach in Sanary. *Market: Every morning there is a Proven√ßal market under the plane trees, with much fresh produce. Jacques Cousteau had a house in Sanary, the Villa Baobab. He was a pioneer of deep sea diving equipment, which he invented and developed around Sanary. The is in a 13th-century Romanesque tower made available by the municipality; it bills itself as an historical city of diving. Fr√©d√©ric Dumas was a co-inventor with Cousteau of the aqua-lung. Sanary was the birthplace of Ernest Blanc (1923-2010), a distinguished operatic baritone who enjoyed a long international career. Sanary hosts every year during the month of May the prestigious international photography festival PHOTOMED, now also held in parallel in Beirut. Literary Sanary With the rise of Nazism in the early 1930s, a great number of German writers and intellectuals left Germany and settled here: the playwright Bertold Brecht, Egon Erwin Kisch, Thomas Mann, Ludwig Marcuse, Joseph Roth, Franz Werfel and his wife Alma Mahler widow of Gustav Mahler at Le Moulin Gris (near the Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Piti√©), Lion Feuchtwanger at Villa Lazare then at Villa Valmer, and Arnold Zweig. Patronised by Jean Cocteau and his coterie, Sanary had already drawn Aldous Huxley, who wrote Brave New World at Villa Huley, and his wife, Maria; they attracted other English visitors, such as D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Frieda; Julian Huxley and his wife, Juliette; and others. The German expatriates clustered around Thomas Mann and his large family, his brother Heinrich and his wife (the model for Blue Angel), the writers Stefan Zweig and Arnold Zweig, the art critic Julius Meier-Graefe, and the artist Ren√© Schickele. Sybille von Schoenebeck (later, as Sybille Bedford, the author of A Legacy) lived here with her mother. Ludwig Marcuse in his book \\"Mein Zwanzigstes Jahrhundert\\" (p. 160) wrote about Sanary: \\"Wir wohnten im Paradies - notgedrungen\\" - we lived in paradise, against our will. \\"If one lives in exile,\\" wrote Hermann Kesten, \\"The caf√© becomes at once the family home, the nation, church and parliament, a desert and a place of pilgrimage, cradle of illusions and their cemetery... In exile, the caf√© is the one place where life goes on.\\" With the declaration of war in 1939, the French government treated these exiles as enemy aliens and interned some of them in camps like the concentration Camp des Milles near Aix-en-Provence, and eventually some were sent to Auschwitz. After liberation, the whole episode went ignored until the 1990s when, perhaps thanks to the increasing number of tourists from Germany, a commemorative plaque was unveiled, and literary itineraries were signposted.

It borders on Littleton, Massachusetts. Operating each winter since its opening in 1964, it has 17 trails including a variety of terrain. There is also a terrain park that is one of the best in Massachusetts. The area also features a tubing park with 16 runs served by two Poma handle tows and a Sun-Kid Conveyor; this is on the same property, but has a separate entrance on Route 119 in Littleton, Massachusetts. History Nashoba Valley Ski Area opened for its first season in 1964. There were rope tows servicing four slopes. That season was dependent on Mother Nature for snow cover and due to a wet, warm winter, the season only lasted 14 days. The base lodge had a gravel floor and was heated by a pot-bellied stove, and staff had to pack the snow on the slopes with shovels due to a lack of grooming machines. In the 70s Nashoba started to expand with the purchase of the T-Bar lift in 1972, a double chair in 1977, and a triple in 1978 (The Wardance Triple). Then in the 1986 the \\"Chief\\" Triple was added, followed by the \\"Sundance\\" triple in 1994. Today Nashoba Valley operates with four chairlifts, two conveyors, and three rope tows for an uphill capacity of 11,600 per hour. Nashoba Valley was also one of the first areas in the country to allow snowboarding. During the 80s it hosted some of the largest events to date, with names like Jeff Brushie, Jason Ford, and a very young Todd Richards competing. Nashoba Valley, while being a full-service ski area offering lessons, rentals, skiing, and snowboarding is also host to numerous other activities. Nashoba Valley's snowtubing Park, which opened in 2001, is New England's largest snowtubing facility with two lifts, over 600 snowtubes and up to 16 lanes. The Outlook Restaurant, the on-site restaurant and lounge, offers fine dining and catering year-round. Witch's Woods, New England's Premier Halloween Screampark and Haunted Hayride, operates in October with four attractions plus stage shows, the Jack-O-Lantern Jamboree and more. During the summer months, Nashoba offers a children's day camp, adult summer volleyball league, and a private swim club. Lifts The area is served by 4 chairlifts, 4 conveyor lifts, and 3 rope tows. Currently the top is only accessible by the chairlifts, but used to be served by a rope tow powered by an old school bus and a T-Bar. All intermediate and advanced terrain is accessible from any chairlift. The beginner area, which has the easiest trails goes only about a quarter of the way up the hill, it is served by 3 rope tows and four Sun-Kid conveyor belt lifts. The longest trail is 1400 feet. Chairlifts Chief Triple is a Borvig triple chair. Wardance Triple is a CTEC triple chair, this was built to replace the original rope tow to the top, although the two co-existed for a number of years. Note that the rope-tow was a much faster way to get to the top. Snowdance Double is a Savio double chair. Sundance Triple is a CTEC triple chair. Surface Lifts Papoose is a Sun- Kid conveyor belt lift which replaces a Gasoline powered rope tow of the same name, which ran about 6 feet to the east of the present lift. Totem is a Sun- Kid conveyor belt lift located adjacent to Papoose. Pow Wow is a rope tow, built out of an old dump truck, the rope runs between the double tires, and over old car wheel rims mounted on old telephone poles. The lift was originally powered by the truck's diesel engine, but was later converted to run on an electric motor. This lift has two ropes that run parallel over both truck wheels, and is considered as two separate lifts, however both ropes are powered by the same motor, so they start and stop at the same times. Peace Pipe is a rope tow built in a similar fashion to the Pow Wow tow, except that it has only one rope. Lil'Hawk is a Sun-Kid conveyor belt lift, which was originally built at the base of the lift line for the \\"Tomahawk T-Bar\\", but was later moved to a location between the bottom terminals of the Snowdance Double and the Sundance Triple. Tahu is a Sun-Kid conveyor belt lift,this conveyor was brand new for the 2014-2015 season, operating between the beginner area and Nashoba Slope.

The tubing park has 18 lanes serviced by a conveyor and 2 rope tows. The tubing park also has its own lodge and restaurant.  Restaurants = The Outlook at Nashoba  The Outlook Restaurant and Lounge is a ski lounged located at Nashoba Valley Ski Area. It is open seven days a week in the fall, winter and summer. It features floor to ceiling windows overlooking the slopes and a roaring fire in the winter months. During the evenings, there are live bands for bar hours. The restaurant also hosts private functions. There are many events surrounding holidays, such as the New Years Celebration in which fireworks are set off of the ski hill, and a Mother's Day Brunch. The restaurant closes for the spring season and reopens in the summer, along with the Sunset Tiki Bar and Grill, serving as an overflow when it is overcapacity and an indoor option for inopportune weather.  The Sunset Tiki Bar and Grill  The Sunset Tiki Bar and Grill is another family-friendly restaurant attached to the Nashoba Valley Ski area. It opens in late may for the duration of the summer. The restaurant sits on a deck alongside a pond and sand beach area. There is a lifeguard on duty for children to swim and there are tables in the sand to enjoy food and drinks. A beach stage sits on the deck for evening entertainment of local bands' live music. There is a main bar that is always open, as well as a satellite bar for the busier nights. Towards the end of the season, the restaurant hosts events such as Lobster Fest and the Pig N' Pepper Festival. = Hours = The restaurant opens at 5 PM for dinner. During the day, private functions are held under the tents and semi-private functions are held during the evening while the restaurant is open. After 9 PM, it is 21+ and the bar is open until 1 AM. Dinner is served until 10 PM Monday-Wednesday and until 11 PM Thursday-Saturday. The restaurant is not open on Sundays, besides the exception of occasional private functions. = Theme Nights = During weeknights, there are weekly themes. There are special discounts on the menu items pertaining to the theme.

It was founded in 1892 and established at its current location in 1921. The name comes from Lt. H. Lawrence Cory, an American World War I soldier who was killed in action. Camp Cory is run by the YMCA and is certified by the American Camp Association (ACA). The 27-acre property is south of the village of Penn Yan, in the town of Milo, New York. It is about an hour south of Rochester, New York and about an hour and a half southwest of Syracuse, New York. The camp occupies a significant amount of waterfront property. Background YMCA Camp Cory is one of the oldest camps in the State of New York; however, its predecessor was a Rochester YMCA camp called Camp Iola. Since Camp Iola was founded in 1892, including this as a part of Camp Cory's history places it among the oldest continually running resident camps in the nation. At current, it would appear that Camp Cory is the seventh-oldest camp in the world. Camp Cory's sailing program utilizes mainly JY15s, which have all but replaced the much older Wright-built K-Boats acquired by the camp in the 1950s. K-Boats, named after the famous Kohinoor Diamond, are no longer manufactured. Although its fleet has been significantly reduced in recent years, Camp Cory once had ‚Äì and possibly continues to have ‚Äì the largest fleet of K-Boats in the world. In 2008, the camp received a donation of two J-24 boats. The camp draws its attendance predominantly from Rochester and its suburbs, although campers often come from Syracuse, Buffalo and other towns in New York. In the past, campers have come from such places as Missouri, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia, Florida, Columbia, Sweden, Brazil, Spain, and Japan. Camp Cory uses a significant amount of new media and social media in its advertising and in keeping in contact with parents and alumni. For example, photos of all-camp games and evening programs are sent out via Twitter, as they occur.Camp Cory's Twitter page Summer camp The Cory \\"Thunderbird,\\" where all-camp meetings take place. This Thunderbird replaced the old one in 2007. Villages Campers are both male and female, and may be anywhere between 7 and 15 years of age. 7-10-year-olds are predominantly assigned to Craig Village, 11-12-year-olds to Wells Village, and 13-15-year-olds to Walmsley Village. 11-15-year-olds who wish to participate in an intensive sailing program live in Maijgren Village, on the waterfront. All of the villages are named after persons who once attended or who significantly affected the camp. In addition to the resident camp program, Camp Cory recently added a Day Camp for children ages 5‚Äì12, drawn from the local community and from families vacationing on Keuka Lake. Villages are to help campers get to know children their age. Leadership program 16- to 17-year-olds can participate in a 3-week Counselor-in-Training (CIT) program. CITs live for two weeks in the Mangurian Leadership Lodge, a 32-bed, fully winterized building built in 2005. During that time, CITs shadow counselors, learn valuable leadership and childcare skills, and participate in a team- building work project. For the second two weeks of the CIT session, the CITs are placed in cabins or in Day Camp, essentially acting as apprentice counselors. Exceptional CITs are sometimes invited to remain at camp for the summer as unpaid Interns. Capacity and facilities Camp Cory has a capacity of over 220 beds. In recent summers, there have been around 1300 camper-weeks registered per summer (this means that one camper registering for three weeks is counted three times). Camp Cory's facilities are expansive, including three waterfronts (one for swimming, one for sailing, and one for canoeing & kayaking), a three faced climbing wall with a zip-line, an archery range, an outdoor amphitheatre, tennis courts, open fields for athletics, and outdoor basketball courts. Camp Cory also owns a sizable amount of land in Guyanoga, a hamlet north of Branchport, New York, and purchased additional land at the site in 2010. A parcel of land, directly to the south and adjacent to the camp, was added in 2014. Renovations The summer of 2008 saw renovations of the Leroy Health Lodge as well as the addition of a high ropes course. In 2009 the camp built additional staff housing along the northern edge of the camp, as well as an alumni-overnight cabin in Junior Village (named \\"Craig Village\\"). In 2009 and 2010, the camp office ‚Äì one of the oldest buildings on the property, dating back to the early 1920s ‚Äì was renovated extensively. Notable alumni *Teddy Geiger ‚Äì Musician *A.J.

In Durban, Arneil trained at a judo dojo (training hall) that also offered karate training. He made a practice of going down to the harbour and asking arriving Japanese people if they practised karate; if they did, he would invite them to training at the dojo. In 1959, Arneil left South Africa, bound for Southeast Asia.Travers, P., & Travers, V. (2005): Hanshi Steve Arneil (9th Dan) Retrieved on 14 March 2010. Japan Arneil travelled to China, South Korea, and Hong Kong before arriving in Japan. He trained in a few karate styles, including Shotokan, Wado-ryu, and Goju-ryu (under Gogen Yamaguchi). In the course of these studies, the name \\"Oyama\\" was mentioned to him by several people, including Yamaguchi, and this aroused his curiosity. In January 1961, through Donn Draeger, Arneil began to study Kyokushin karate under Masutatsu Oyama. (c. 2005). Retrieved on 16 March 2010. He recalled that, unlike the other karate schools he had visited in Japan (who had welcomed him with minimal reservation), Oyama's Kyokushin school was selective; on their first meeting, Oyama told Arneil, \\"Remember, you asked me to train, I didn't ask you. You don't follow the rules, you out. Understand?\\" Arneil was promoted to the rank of 1st dan in Kyokushin karate on 15 May 1962, and attained 2nd dan on 16 April 1963. He was later 'adopted' by Oyama, to allow him to marry a Japanese woman in 1964. Of his wife, Tsuyuko Arneil, he has said, \\"She worked in a bank, and she supported both of us when I was training. I didn't have time for work.\\" Arneil estimated that he trained an average of six hours each day during his time in Japan, with training normally commencing at 10:00 AM and concluding between 10:30 PM to 1:00 AM the next morning. On 22 May 1965, Arneil became the first person to complete the 100-man kumite after Oyama himself.Yussof, S. (c. 2005): 100 Man Kumite Retrieved on 14 March 2010.Powell, G. (2006): Waking dragons: A martial artist faces his ultimate test (p. 62). Chichester: Summersdale. () The 100-man kumite took him around 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete, with each round scheduled to take 1 minute and 30 seconds (but a round ended if he managed to knock down his opponent). In an interview in 2005, Arneil said, \\"I did not have to beat everyone I fought, that would have been ridiculous! I just had to keep going, I had to have the spirit not to give up, no matter what they threw at me.\\" On 10 July 1965, Arneil was promoted to 3rd dan. United Kingdom Originally, Arneil had planned to return to South Africa, but Oyama asked him to go to the United Kingdom to help establish Kyokushin karate there; accordingly, he and his wife travelled to London in 1965. The move was not an easy one. Arneil recalled: \\"We were greeted by stares, the same stares we had faced in Japan, only this time they were directed at my wife. The war was still on, you see, and the Japanese were seen as the enemy. We had travelled half way round the world and we still faced the same prejudice that we had faced in Japan. That was very hard for both of us.\\" The couple tried to move to Australia, but this failed; Arneil said that \\"it is purely by chance that we ended up staying in England.\\" In late 1965, Arneil and Bob Boulton founded the British Karate Kyokushinkai (BKK) organisation.Loughborough Kyokushinkai Karate: About Kyokushinkai Retrieved on 16 March 2010.

From 1968 to 1976, he was the Team Manager and Coach for the All Styles English and British Karate team which, in 1975/76, became the first non-Japanese team to win the karate World Championship. Arneil was promoted to 5th dan on 15 January 1968, and to 6th dan on 7 October 1974. In 1975, the French Karate Federation awarded him the title of \\"World's Best Coach.\\" On 6 August 1977, Arneil was promoted to the rank of 7th dan in Kyokushin karate. Later life Kyokushin's 5th World Tournament, in 1991, was a significant point in the history of the IKO. Arneil stated simply, \\"It was a fixed tournament.\\" He claimed that political and financial pressures contributed to the situation, but that \\"the decider was when Sosai [Oyama] was supposed to meet me in Switzerland, and he didn't come. I didn't want to be involved in the politics anymore. I left the IKO, not Kyokushin.\\" That same year, Arneil and the BKK resigned from the IKO, and Arneil then founded his own karate organisation, the IFK.

He has achieved global recognition for his drilling and analysis of ice cores from mountain glaciers and ice caps in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. He and his wife, Ellen Mosley-Thompson, run the ice core paleoclimatology research group at the Byrd Polar Research Center. Early Life and Education Lonnie Thompson (Lanyard) was born July 1, 1948 in Gassaway, West Virginia. He was raised on a farm near Gassaway, W.Va. He obtained his undergraduate degree from Marshall University, where he majored in geology. He subsequently attended The Ohio State University where he received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geology.  Career and impact  Thompson is one of the world‚Äôs foremost authorities on paleoclimatology and glaciology. For over 40 years, he has led 60 expeditions where they conduct ice-core drilling programs in the Polar Regions as well as on tropical and subtropical ice fields in 16 countries including China, Peru, Russia, Tanzania and Papua, Indonesia (New Guinea). He and his team from the Ohio State University have developed light-weight solar-powered drilling equipment for acquisition of histories from ice fields in the tropical South American Andes, the Himalayas, and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The results from these paleoclimate histories were published in more than 230 articles and have contributed toward improved understanding of Earth‚Äôs climate system, both past and present. In the 1970s, he was the first scientist \\"to retrieve ice samples from a remote tropical ice cap, such as the Quelccaya ice cap in the Andes of Peru, and analyze them for ancient climate signals.\\" He created the ice core research program at Ohio State while still a graduate student there. In regards to the dedication required to attain this ice, one author writes: For comparison, the Everest lower base camp is at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) and the upper base camp is at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). (The mountain itself is 8,848 m (29,029 ft).) Rolling Stone magazine says that there is no person in the world who has spent more time above 18,000 feet than Lonnie Thompson. His observations of glacier retreat (1970s‚Äì2000s) \\"confirm that glaciers around the world are melting and provide clear evidence that the warming of the last 50 years is now outside the range of climate variability for several millennia, if not longer.\\" In 2001, he incorrectly predicted that the famed snows of Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro would melt within the next 20 years, a victim of climate change across the tropics. Return expeditions to the mountain have shown that changes in the mountain's ice fields may signal an even quicker melting of its snow fields, which Thompson documented had existed for thousands of years. Thompson and his wife both served as advisers for the Academy Award-winning 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, by Al Gore, Jr., and some of their work was referenced in the movie.  Personal Life  Lonnie Thompson is married to Ellen Mosley-Thompson for more than 40 years. They met in the 1970s in the Marshall University while he was studying geology and she was pursuing a degree in physics. After their graduation, they both pursued graduate degrees in geology at the Ohio State University (OSU). They are now research partners who are both interested in examining the effects. of climate change on the world's glacial regions and in developing the technology to drill deep in the ice. On May 1, 2012, he underwent a successful heart transplant.  Honors and awards  *2001: Thompson was featured among eighteen scientists and researchers as \\"America's Best\\" by CNN and Time Magazine. *2002: Thompson was awarded the Dr A.H.

The individual belief systems under this umbrella are practiced by loosely affiliated or independent groups and cabals. Another characteristic of theistic Satanism is the use of ceremonial magic. The history of theistic Satanism, as an existing spiritual path which is practiced by people, is obscured by the fact that a number of groups were accused of being devil-worshippers even though they asserted that they were not, which was the case in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe. Most actual theistic Satanist religions exist in relatively new models and ideologies, many of which claim to be independent of the Abrahamic religions. Currents within recent and contemporary theistic Satanism The internet has increased awareness of different beliefs among Satanists, and has led to more diverse groups, but Satanism has always been a pluralistic and decentralised religion. Scholars outside Satanism have sought to study it by categorizing forms of it according to whether they are theistic or atheistic, and they referred to the practice of working with a literal Satan as theistic or \\"traditional\\" Satanism. It is generally a prerequisite to being considered a theistic Satanist that the Satanist accept a theological and metaphysical canon which involves one or more god(s) who are either Satan in the strictest, Abrahamic sense, or are a concept of Satan that incorporates gods from other religions (usually pre-Christian), such as Ahriman or Enki. Many theistic Satanists believe that their own individualized concepts are based on pieces of all of these diverse conceptions of Satan, according to their inclinations and sources of spiritual guidance, rather than only believing in one suggested interpretation. Some may choose to live out the myths and stereotypes, but Christianity is not always the primary frame of reference for theistic Satanists. Their religion may be based on dark Pagan, Left-Hand Path, black magic, and occult traditions. Theistic Satanists who base their faith on Christian ideas about Satan may be referred to as \\"reverse Christians\\" by other Satanists, often in a pejorative fashion. However, those labeled by some as \\"reverse Christians\\" may see their concept of Satan as undiluted or sanitized. They worship a stricter interpretation of Satan: that of the Satan featured in the Christian Bible.Archived Cathedral of the Black Goat 'Views' Page This is not, however, shared by a majority of theistic Satanists. Wiccans may consider most Satanism to be reverse Christianity, and the head of the atheistic Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, considers \\"devil worship\\" to be a Christian heresy, that is, a divergent form of Christianity. The diversity of individual beliefs within theistic Satanism, while being a cause for intense debates within the religion, is also often seen as a reflection of Satan, who encourages individualism. In Luciferianism, Michael W. Ford, author and black metal musician, abandoned the Order of Nine Angles in 1998, criticizing it for its Neo-Nazi ideology, and founded his own autonomous Satanist organizations in the same year: the Order of Phosphorus and the Black Order of the Dragon; in the following years, he founded the Church of Adversarial Light in 2007, and the Greater Church of Lucifer (GCOL) in 2013. In 2015, Ford announced that the Order of Phosphorus would be integrated into the Greater Church of Lucifer, which welcomes both theistic and rationalistic Satanists, as well as Pagans and various followers of diverse occult spiritualities. Ford presents both a theistic and atheistic approach to Luciferianism, and his ideas are enunciated in a wide compendium of publications, although they're difficult to situate into a single, cohesive belief system; the Wisdom of Eosphoros (2015) is considered the Greater Church of Lucifer's official statement and the core of its Luciferian philosophy. Theistic Luciferianism is considered an individualistic, personal spirituality which is established via initiation and validation of the Adversarial philosophy. Luciferians, if theistic, do not accept the submission of 'worship' yet rather a unique and subjective type of Apotheosis via the energies of perceived deities, spirits and demons. Joy of Satan, a website founded in the early 2000s by Maxine Dietrich (pseudonym of Andrea Herrington), wife of the American National Socialist Movement's co- founder and former leader Clifford Herrington, combines theistic Satanism with Neo-Nazism, racial anti-Semitism, anti-Judaic, anti-Christian sentiment and Gnostic Paganism, as well as UFO conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Joy of Satan advocates \\"spiritual Satanism\\" and believes Satan to be a sentient and powerful extraterrestrial being. In 2004, following the exposure of Andrea Herrington among Joy of Satan's members as the wife of Neo-Nazi leader Clifford Herrington and her ties with the National Socialist Movement, many adherents abandoned Joy of Satan and formed their own autonomous Satanist or Pagan organizations. In July 2006, after the exposure of Herrington's wife's Satanic website within the National Socialist Movement, Andrea and Clifford Herrington were both kicked out of the National Socialist Movement; following the Herrington scandal, Bill White, the then National Socialist Movement's spokesman, also quit alongside many others. A notable group that outwardly considers themselves to be traditional Satanists is the Order of Nine Angles. This group became controversial and was mentioned in the press and in books, because they promoted human sacrifice. The ONA believes that Satan is one of two 'acausal' eternal beings, the other one being Baphomet, and that Satan is male and Baphomet is female. A group with very different ideology to the ONA is the Satanic Reds, whose Satanism has a communist element. However, they are not theistic Satanist in the manner of believing in Satan as a god with a personality, but believe in dark Deism, the belief that Satan is a presence in nature. The First Church of Satan believe the philosophy propounded by Anton LaVey himself in The Satanic Bible was deism or panentheism but is propounded as atheism by the leaders of the Church of Satan in order to distance themselves from what they see as pseudo-Satanists. One other group is the Temple of the Black Light, formerly known as the Misanthropic Luciferian Order prior to 2007. The group espouses a philosophy known as \\"Chaosophy\\". Chaosophy asserts that the world that we live in, and the universe that it lives in, all exists within the realm known as Cosmos. Cosmos is made of three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension. Cosmos rarely ever changes and is a materialistic realm. Another realm that exists is known as Chaos. Chaos exists outside of the Cosmos and is made of infinite dimensions and unlike the Cosmos, it is always changing. Members of the TotBL believe that the realm of Chaos is ruled over by 11 dark gods, the highest of them being Satan, and all of said gods are considered manifestations of a higher being. This higher being is known as Azerate, the Dragon Mother, and is all of the 11 gods united as one. The TotBL believes that Azerate will resurrect one day and destroy the Cosmos and let Chaos consume everything. The group has been connected to the Swedish black/death metal band Dissection, particularly its front man Jon N√∂dtveidt. N√∂dtveidt was introduced to the group \\"at an early stage\\". The lyrics on the band's third album, Reinkaos, are all about beliefs of the Temple of the Black Light. N√∂dtveidt committed suicide in 2006. Theistic Satanists may respectfully work with demons found in traditional grimoires. Satan summons His Legions Theistic Luciferian groups are particularly inspired by Lucifer (from the Latin for ‚Äòbearer of light‚Äô), who they may or may not equate with Satan. While some theologians believe the Son of the Dawn, Lucifer, and other names were actually used to refer to contemporary political figures, such as a Babylonian King, rather than a single spiritual entitySatan, Devil and Demons - Isaiah 14:12-14 (although on the surface the Bible explicitly refers to the King of Tyrus), those that believe it refers to Satan infer that by implication it also applies to the fall of Satan. Some writers equate the veneration of Set by the Temple of Set to theistic Satanism. However, the Temple of Set do not identify as theistic Satanists. They believe the Egyptian deity Set is the real Dark Lord behind the name Satan, of whom Satan is just a caricature. Their practices primarily center on self-development. Within the temple of Set, the Black Flame is the individual's god-like core which is a kindred spirit to Set, and they seek to develop. In theistic Satanism, the Black Flame is knowledge which was given to humanity by Satan, who is a being independent of the Satanist himself and which he can dispense to the Satanist who seeks knowledge. Some groups are mistaken by scholars for theistic Satanists, such as the First Church of Satan. However, the founder of the FCoS considers what he calls \\"devil- worship\\" to often be a symptom of psychosis.Is Devil Worship a Symptom of Psychosis? by High Priest John Allee Other groups such as the 600 Club, are accepting of all types of Satanist, as are the Sinagogue of Satan, which aims for the ultimate destruction of religions, paradoxically including itself, and encourages not self-indulgence, but self-expression balanced by social responsibility. The diversity of beliefs amongst Satanists, and the theistic nature of some Satanists, was seen in a survey in 1995. Some spoke of seeing Satan not as someone dangerous to those who seek or worship him, but as someone that could be approached as a friend. Some refer to him as Father, though some other theistic Satanists consider that to be confused or excessively subservient. Satan is also portrayed as a father to his daughter, Sin, by Milton in Paradise Lost. Values in theistic Satanism The most notable symbol of theistic Satanism. Seeking knowledge is seen by some theistic Satanists as being important to Satan, due to Satan being equated with the serpent in Genesis, which encouraged humans to partake of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Some perceive Satan as √âliphas L√©vi's conception of Baphomet ‚Äî a hermaphroditic bestower of knowledge (gnosis). Some Satanic groups, such as Luciferians, also seek to gain greater gnosis. Some of such Satanists, such as the former Ophite Cultus Satanas, equate Yahweh with the demiurge of Gnosticism, and Satan with the transcendent being beyond. Self-development is important to theistic Satanists. This is due to the Satanists' idea of Satan, who is seen to encourage individuality and freedom of thought, and the quest to raise one's self up despite resistance, through means such as magic and initiative. They believe Satan wants a more equal relationship with his followers than the Abrahamic God does with his. From a theistic Satanist perspective, the Abrahamic religions (chiefly Christianity) do not define \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" in terms of benefit or harm to humanity, but rather on the submission to or rebellion against God. Some Satanists seek to remove any means by which they are controlled or repressed by others and forced to follow the herd, and reject non-governmental authoritarianism. As Satan in the Old Testament tests people, theistic Satanists may believe that Satan sends them tests in life in order to develop them as individuals. They value taking responsibility for oneself. Despite the emphasis on self-development, some theistic Satanists believe that there is a will of Satan for the world and for their own lives. They may promise to help bring about the will of Satan, and seek to gain insight about it through prayer, study, or magic. In the Bible, a being called \\"the god of this world\\" is mentioned in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians , which Christians typically equate with Satan. Some Satanists therefore think that Satan can help them meet their worldly needs and desires if they pray or work magic. They would also have to do what they could in everyday life to achieve their goals, however. Theistic Satanists may try not to project an image that reflects negatively on their religion as a whole and reinforces stereotypes, such as promoting Nazism, abuse, or crime. However, some groups, such as the Order of Nine Angles, criticize the emphasis on promoting a good image for Satanism; the ONA described LaVeyan Satanism as \\"weak, deluded and American form of 'sham-Satanic groups, the poseurs'\\",Commentary on Dreamers of the Dark . and ONA member Stephen Brown claimed that \\"the Temple of Set seems intent only on creating a 'good public impression', with promoting an 'image'\\".Stephen Brown: The Satanic Letters of Stephen Brown: St. Brown to Dr. Aquino (online version ). The order emphasises that its way \\"is and is meant to be dangerous\\"The True Way of the ONA . and \\"[g]enuine Satanists are dangerous people to know; associating with them is a risk\\".Satanism: The Epitome of Evil . Similarly, the Temple of the Black Light has criticized the Church of Satan, and has stated that the Temple of Set is \\"trying to make Setianism and the ruler of darkness, Set, into something accepted and harmless, this way attempting to become a 'big' religion, accepted and acknowledged by the rest of the Judaeo-Christian society\\". The TotBL rejects Christianity, Judaism and Islam as \\"the opposite of everything that strengthens the spirit and is only good for killing what little that is beautiful, noble and honorable in this filthy world\\". There is argument among Satanists over animal sacrifice, with most groups seeing it as both unnecessary and putting Satanism in a bad light, and distancing themselves from the few groups that practice it, such as the Temple of the Black Light. Theistic Satanism often involves a religious commitment, rather than being simply an occult practice based on dabbling or transient enjoyment of the rituals and magic involved. Practitioners may choose to perform a self- dedication rite, although there are arguments over whether it is best to do this at the beginning of their time as a theistic Satanist, or once they have been practicing for some time. Historical mentions of Satanism Illustration by Martin van Ma√´le, of a Witches' Sabbath, in the 1911 edition of La Sorciere, by Jules Michelet. The worship of Satan was a frequent charge against those charged in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe and other witch-hunts such as the Salem witch trials. The charge of Satan worship has also been made against groups or individuals regarded with suspicion, such as the Knights Templar, or minority religions. In the case of the Knights Templar, the Templars' writings mentioned the word 'Baphomet', which was a French corruption of the name 'Mohammed' (the prophet of the people who the Templars fought against), and that 'Baphomet' was falsely portrayed as a demon by the people who accused the Templars. It is not known to what extent accusations of groups worshiping Satan in the time of the witch trials identified people who did consider themselves Satanists, rather than being the result of religious superstition or mass hysteria, or charges made against individuals suffering from mental illness. Confessions are unreliable, particularly as they were usually obtained under torture. However, scholar Jeffrey Burton Russell, Professor Emeritus of the University of California at Santa Barbara, has made extensive arguments in his book Witchcraft in the Middle Ages that not all witch trial records can be dismissed and that there is in fact evidence linking witchcraft to gnostic heresies. Russell comes to this conclusion after having studied the source documents themselves. Individuals involved in the Affair of the Poisons were accused of Satanism and witchcraft. √âliphas L√©vi's Baphomet, adopted symbol of some Left-Hand Path systems, including some theistic Satanist groups. Historically, Satanist was a pejorative term for those with opinions that differed from predominant religious or moral beliefs. Paul Tuitean believes the idea of acts of \\"reverse Christianity\\" was created by the Inquisition, but George Bataille believes that inversions of Christian rituals such as the Mass may have existed prior to the descriptions of them which were obtained through the witchcraft trials. sigil of Lucifer, as it originally appeared in the Grimorium Verum In the 18th century various kinds of popular \\"Satanic\\" literature began to be produced in France, including some well-known grimoires with instructions for making a pact with the Devil. Most notable are the Grimorium Verum and The Grand Grimoire. The Marquis de Sade describes defiling crucifixes and other holy objects, and in his novel Justine he gives a fictional account of the Black Mass, although Ronald Hayman has said Sade's need for blasphemy was an emotional reaction and rebellion from which Sade moved on, seeking to develop a more reasoned atheistic philosophy. In the 19th century, Eliphas Levi published his French books of the occult, and in 1855 produced his well-known drawing of the Baphomet which continues to be used by some Satanists today. That Baphomet drawing is the basis of the sigil of Baphomet, which was first adopted by the non-theistic Satanist group called the Church of Satan.http://www.churchofsatan.com/images/church-of-satan-logo-black.png Finally, in 1891, Joris-Karl Huysmans published his Satanic novel, L√†-bas, which included a detailed description of a Black Mass which he may have known firsthand was being performed in Paris at the time, or the account may have been based on the masses carried out by √âtienne Guibourg, rather than by Huysmans attending himself. Quotations from Huysmans' Black Mass are also used in some Satanic rituals to this day, since it is one of the few sources that purports to describe the words used in a Black Mass. The type of Satanism described in L√†-bas suggests that prayers are said to the Devil, hosts are stolen from the Catholic Church, and sexual acts are combined with Roman Catholic altar objects and rituals, to produce a variety of Satanism which exalts the Devil and degrades the God of Christianity by inverting Roman Catholic rites. George Bataille claims that Huysman's description of the Black Mass is \\"indisputably authentic\\". Not all theistic Satanists today routinely perform the Black Mass, possibly because the Mass is not a part of modern evangelical Christianity in Protestant countries and so not such an unintentional influence on Satanist practices in those countries. The earliest verifiable theistic Satanist group was a small group called the Ophite Cultus Satanas, which was created in Ohio in 1948. The Ophite Cultus Satanas was inspired by the ancient Ophite sect of Gnosticism, and the Horned God of Wicca. The group was dependent upon its founder and leader, and therefore dissolved after his death in 1975. Michael Aquino published a rare 1970 text of a Church of Satan Black Mass, the Missa Solemnis, in his book The Church of Satan,, Appendix 7. and Anton LaVey included a different Church of Satan Black Mass, the Messe Noire, in his 1972 book The Satanic Rituals. LaVey's books on Satanism, which began in the 1960s, were for a long time the few available which advertised themselves as being Satanic, although others detailed the history of witchcraft and Satanism, such as The Black Arts by Richard Cavendish published in 1967 and the classic French work Satanism and Witchcraft, by Jules Michelet. Anton LaVey specifically denounced \\"devil worshippers\\" and the idea of praying to Satan. Although non-theistic LaVey Satanism had been popular since the publication of The Satanic Bible in 1969, theistic Satanism did not start to gain any popularity until the emergence of the Order of Nine Angles in western England, and its publication of The Black Book of Satan in 1984.The Black Book of Satan. 1984, Thormynd Press, . British Library General Reference Collection Cup.815/51, BNB GB8508400 The next theistic Satanist group to be created was the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, which was created in Sweden in 1995. The MLO incorporated elements from the Order of Nine Angles, the Illuminates of Thanateros and Qliphothic Qabalah. Modern-day public image of Satanism and moral panics As a moral panic in the 1980s and the 1990s, there were multiple allegations of sexual abuse and/or sacrifice of children or non-consenting adults in the context of Satanic rituals in what has come to be known as the Satanic Panic. Allegations included the existence of large networks of organized Satanists involved in illegal activities such as murder, child pornography and prostitution. In the United States, the Kern County child abuse cases, McMartin preschool trial and the West Memphis cases were widely reported. One case took place in Jordan, Minnesota, in which children made allegations of the manufacture of child pornography, ritualistic animal sacrifice, coprophagia, urophagia and infanticide, at which point the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was alerted. Twenty-four adults were arrested and charged with acts of sexual abuse, child pornography and other crimes claimed to be related to Satanic ritual abuse; three went to trial, two were acquitted and one convicted. Supreme Court Justice Scalia noted in a discussion of the case that \\"[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged\\", and cited the repeated, coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990) These iconic cases were launched after children were repeatedly and coercively interrogated by social workers, resulting in false allegations of child sexual abuse. No evidence was ever found to support any of the allegations of Satanism or ritual abuse, but the panic resulted in numerous wrongful prosecutions. Between 1992 and 1996, some militant Neo-Pagans who were participants in the early Norwegian black metal scene, such as Varg Vikernes, committed over fifty arsons of Christian churches in and around Oslo as a retaliatory action against Christianity in Norway, but such church-burnings were widely attributed to Satanists. Some studies of crimes have also looked at the theological perspective of those who commit religious or ritualized crime. Criminals who explain their crimes by claiming to be Satanists have been said by sociologists to be \\"pseudo- Satanists\\", and attempts to link Satanism to crime have been seen by theistic Satanists as scaremongering.

The work of photographer Barry Edmonds started in the Flint Journal beginning in 1955. For 27 years, Edmonds worked at the paper. Edmonds was named the Michigan Press Photographer of the Year four times in the 1960s, more than any other photographer at the time. He was the only Flint Journal photographer to serve as president of the National Press Photographers Association. At the time of his death in July 1982 he was Director of Photography at the Flint Journal. The Barry Edmonds Award was established to recognize and honor photographers whose work best portrays the common purpose of man. The subjects may show facets of human relationships, friendship, mutual concern for the environment, a lifting hope for peace or any aspect of life appropriate to the theme of Michigan Understanding. Trained as an artist from boyhood on, he received his degree in Art Education and was a teacher at Mt. Morris High School from 1954 to 1955. The Flint Journal hired Edmonds in May 1955. He was mentored by Bill Gallagher (Pulitzer Prize 1953)and Dante Levi of The Flint Journal and J. D. Hicks (Hicks Studios). He went on to develop his own style deeply relating to the human condition. As an educator Edmonds emphasized the need for continuing education for photojournalists and newspaper photographers. For many years he was one of the lecturers on the Traveling Short Course sponsored by National Press Photographers Association during 1960s and 1970s which was presented in the United States and Europe. While he remained in Flint, Michigan all his life, he was offered staff positions by The National Geographic Magazine, The Washington Post, The Miami Herald and other prominent newspapers. He chose to remain close to his wife and three children rather than pursue a national career.

The Prins reactionThe Prins reaction is an organic reaction consisting of an electrophilic addition of an aldehyde or ketone to an alkene or alkyne followed by capture of a nucleophile or elimination of an H+ ion.Condensation of formaldehyde with some unsaturated compounds H. J. Prins, Chemisch Weekblad, 16, 64, 1072, 1510 1919Chemical Abstracts 13, 3155 1919 The outcome of the reaction depends on reaction conditions. With water and a protic acid such as sulfuric acid as the reaction medium and formaldehyde the reaction product is a 1,3-diol. When water is absent, the cationic intermediate loses a proton to give an allylic alcohol. With an excess of formaldehyde and a low reaction temperature the reaction product is a dioxane. When water is replaced by acetic acid the corresponding esters are formed. History The original reactants employed by Dutch chemist in his 1919 publication were styrene (scheme 2), pinene, camphene, eugenol, isosafrole and anethole. Scheme 2. The Prins reaction with styrene Hendrik Jacobus Prins discovered two new organic reactions during his doctoral research in the year of 1911-1912. The first one is the addition of polyhalogen compound to olefins and the second reaction is the acid catalyzed addition of aldehydes to olefin compounds. The early studies on Prins reaction are exploratory in nature and did not attract much attention until 1937. The development of petroleum cracking in 1937 increased the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons. As a consequence, commercial availability of lower olefin coupled with an aldehyde produced from oxidation of low boiling paraffin increased the curiosity to study the olefin-aldehyde condensation. Later on, Prins reaction emerged as a powerful C-O and C-C bond forming technique in the synthesis of various molecules in organic synthesis. In 1937 the reaction was investigated as part of a quest for di-olefins to be used in synthetic rubber. Scheme 3. Isoprene Prins reaction Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism for this reaction is depicted in scheme 5. The carbonyl reactant (2) is protonated by a protic acid and for the resulting oxonium ion 3 two resonance structures can be drawn. This electrophile engages in an electrophilic addition with the alkene to the carbocationic intermediate 4. Exactly how much positive charge is present on the secondary carbon atom in this intermediate should be determined for each reaction set. Evidence exists for neighbouring group participation of the hydroxyl oxygen or its neighboring carbon atom. When the overall reaction has a high degree of concertedness, the charge built-up will be modest.Scheme 5. Prins reaction mechanism The three reaction modes open to this oxo- carbenium intermediate are: * in blue: capture of the carbocation by water or any suitable nucleophile through 5 to the 1,3-adduct 6. * in black: proton abstraction in an elimination reaction to unsaturated compound 7. When the alkene carries a methylene group, elimination and addition can be concerted with transfer of an allyl proton to the carbonyl group which in effect is an ene reaction in scheme 6. Scheme 6. Carbonyl-ene reaction versus Prins reaction * in green: capture of the carbocation by additional carbonyl reactant. In this mode the positive charge is dispersed over oxygen and carbon in the resonance structures 8a and 8b. Ring closure leads through intermediate 9 to the dioxane 10. An example is the conversion of styrene to 4-phenyl-m- dioxane.4-Phenyl-m-dioxane R. L. Shriner and Philip R. Ruby Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 4, p.786 (1963); Vol. 33, p.72 (1953). Article * in gray: only in specific reactions and when the carbocation is very stable the reaction takes a shortcut to the oxetane 12. The photochemical Patern√≤‚ÄìB√ºchi reaction between alkenes and aldehydes to oxetanes is more straightforward. Variations Many variations of the Prins reaction exist because it lends itself easily to cyclization reactions and because it is possible to capture the oxo-carbenium ion with a large array of nucleophiles. The halo-Prins reaction is one such modification with replacement of protic acids and water by lewis acids such as stannic chloride and boron tribromide. The halogen is now the nucleophile recombining with the carbocation. The cyclization of certain allyl pulegones in scheme 7 with titanium tetrachloride in dichloromethane at ‚àí78 ¬∞C gives access to the decalin skeleton with the hydroxyl group and chlorine group predominantly in cis configuration (91% cis). This observed cis diastereoselectivity is due to the intermediate formation of a trichlorotitanium alkoxide making possible an easy delivery of chlorine to the carbocation ion from the same face. The trans isomer is preferred (98% cis) when the switch is made to a tin tetrachloride reaction at room temperature. Scheme 7. Halo-Prins reaction The Prins-pinacol reaction is a cascade reaction of a Prins reaction and a pinacol rearrangement. The carbonyl group in the reactant in scheme 8 is masked as a dimethyl acetal and the hydroxyl group is masked as a triisopropylsilyl ether (TIPS). With lewis acid stannic chloride the oxonium ion is activated and the pinacol rearrangement of the resulting Prins intermediate results in ring contraction and referral of the positive charge to the TIPS ether which eventually forms an aldehyde group in the final product as a mixture of cis and trans isomers with modest diastereoselectivity. Scheme 8. Halo-Prins reaction The key oxo-carbenium intermediate can be formed by other routes than simple protonation of a carbonyl. In a key step of the synthesis of exiguolide, it was formed by protonation of a vinylogous ester: Prins reaction Kwon 2008 500px See also * Heteropoly acid ReferencesExternal links * Prins reaction in Alkaloid total synthesis Link * Prins reaction @ organic-chemistry.org Category:Addition reactions Category:Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Prins reaction"},{"id":"4144577","title":"Disability-adjusted life year"},{"id":"4144581","text":"St. Stephen's Abbey, Augsburg (, formerly Stift St. Stephan) is a Benedictine monastery, formerly a house of Augustinian canonesses, in Augsburg in Bavaria, Germany. First foundation Church and monastery in 1683 The monastery, dedicated to Saint Stephen, was founded in 969 by Saint Ulrich, Bishop of Augsburg, and used by Augustinian canonesses. It was dissolved in the secularisation of Bavaria in 1803, and the premises passed into the possession of the town. The army used the site for a few years as a quartermaster's store. Second foundation In 1828 King Ludwig I of Bavaria founded a grammar school here, as a successor to the former Jesuit college of St. Salvator (1582‚Äì1807). In 1835 he established the Benedictine monastery and entrusted it with the running of the school. Barnabas Huber, who had been staying with Prince Fugger of Babenhusen since the closing of Ottobeuren Abbey was selected as the first abbot. In company with Ignatius Albert von Riegg, Bishop of Augsburg (1824-36), he traveled to Benedictine monasteries in Austria and Switzerland, and returned with about twenty monks to make up the new community. As the house began to grow, many of them returned to their respective abbeys. Huber's installation as abbot took place in November 1835. The monks took up teaching at the Royal Lyceum, the Catholic Gymnasium, and the seminary.\\"Succisa Verescit\\", The Downside Review, vol. 1, Downside Abbey., 1882, p. 113 The buildings were entirely destroyed in 1944 but have been re- built. The monks continue to run the school and boarding house, and are engaged in pastoral and youth work. The abbey belongs to the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation.

A very-high-density cable interconnect (VHDCI) is a 68-pin connector that was introduced in the SPI-2 document of SCSI-3. The VHDCI connector is a very small connector that allows placement of four wide SCSI connectors on the back of a single PCI card slot. Physically, it looks like a miniature Centronics type connector. It uses the regular 68-contact pin assignment. The male connector (plug) is used on the cable and the female connector (\\"receptacle\\") on the device. Other uses Apart from the standardized use with the SCSI interface, several vendors have also used VHDCI connectors for other types of computer interfaces: * Nvidia: for an external PCI Express 8-lane interconnect, and used in Quadro Plex VCS and in Quadro NVS 420 as a display port connector * ATI Technologies: on the FireMV 2400 to convey two DVI and two VGA signals on a single connector, and ganging two of these connectors side by side in order to allow the FireMV 2400 to be a low- profile quad display card. The Radeon X1950 XTX Crossfire Edition also used a pair of the connectors to grant more inter-card bandwidth than the PCI Express bus allowed at the time for Crossfire. * AMD: Some Visiontek variants of the Radeon HD 7750 use a VHDCI connector alongside a Mini DisplayPort to allow a 5 (breakout to 4 HDMI+1 mDP) display Eyefinity array on a low profile card. VisionTek also released a similar Radeon HD 5570, though it lacked a Mini DisplayPort. * Juniper Networks: for their 12- and 48-port 100Base-TX PICs (physical interface cards). The cable connects to the VHDCI connector on the PIC on one end, via an RJ-21 connector on the other end, to an RJ-45 patch panel. * Cisco: 3750 StackWise stacking cables * National Instruments: on their high-speed digital I/O cards .

A self-report is any method which involves asking a participant about their feelings, attitudes, beliefs and so on. Examples of self-reports are questionnaires and interviews; self-reports are often used as a way of gaining participants' responses in observational studies and experiments. Self-report studies have validity problems. Patients may exaggerate symptoms in order to make their situation seem worse, or they may under-report the severity or frequency of symptoms in order to minimize their problems. Patients might also simply be mistaken or misremember the material covered by the survey.  Questionnaires and interviews  Questionnaires are a type of self-report method which consist of a set of questions usually in a highly structured written form. Questionnaires can contain both open questions and closed questions and participants record their own answers. Interviews are a type of spoken questionnaire where the interviewer records the responses. Interviews can be structured whereby there is a predetermined set of questions or unstructured whereby no questions are decided in advance. The main strength of self-report methods are that they are allowing participants to describe their own experiences rather than inferring this from observing participants. Questionnaires and interviews are often able to study large samples of people fairly easy and quickly. They are able to examine a large number of variables and can ask people to reveal behaviour and feelings which have been experienced in real situations. However participants may not respond truthfully, either because they cannot remember or because they wish to present themselves in a socially acceptable manner. Social desirability bias can be a big problem with self-report measures as participants often answer in a way to portray themselves in a good light. Questions are not always clear and we do not know if the respondent has really understood the question we would not be collecting valid data. If questionnaires are sent out, say via email or through tutor groups, response rate can be very low. Questions can often be leading. That is, they may be unwittingly forcing the respondent to give a particular reply. Unstructured interviews can be very time consuming and difficult to carry out whereas structured interviews can restrict the respondents‚Äô replies. Therefore psychologists often carry out semi-structured interviews which consist of some pre-determined questions and followed up with further questions which allow the respondent to develop their answers. Open and closed questions Questionnaires and interviews can use open or closed questions, or both. Closed questions are questions which provide a limited choice (for example, a participant's age or their favourite type of football team), especially if the answer must be taken from a predetermined list. Such questions provide quantitative data, which is easy to analyse. However these questions do not allow the participant to give in-depth insights. Open questions are those questions which invite the respondent to provide answers in their own words and provide qualitative data. Although these type of questions are more difficult to analyse, they can produce more in-depth responses and tell the researcher what the participant actually thinks, rather than being restricted by categories. Rating scales One of the most common rating scales is the Likert scale. A statement is used and the participant decides how strongly they agree or disagree with the statements. For example the participant decides whether Mozzarella cheese is great with the options of \\"strongly agree\\", \\"agree\\", \\"undecided\\", \\"disagree\\", and \\"strongly disagree\\". One strength of Likert scales is that they can give an idea about how strongly a participant feels about something. This therefore gives more detail than a simple yes no answer. Another strength is that the data are quantitative, which are easy to analyse statistically. However, there is a tendency with Likert scales for people to respond towards the middle of the scale, perhaps to make them look less extreme. As with any questionnaire, participants may provide the answers that they feel they should. Moreover, because the data is quantitative, it does not provide in-depth replies. Fixed-choice questions Fixed-choice questions are phrased so that the respondent has to make a fixed- choice answer, usually 'yes' or 'no'. This type of questionnaire is easy to measure and quantify. It also prevents a participant from choosing an option that is not in the list. Respondents may not feel that their desired response is available. For example, a person who dislikes all alcoholic beverages may feel that it is inaccurate to choose a favorite alcoholic beverage from a list that includes beer, wine, and liquor, but does not include none of the above as an option. Answers to fixed-choice questions are not in-depth. Reliability Reliability refers to how consistent a measuring device is. A measurement is said to be reliable or consistent if the measurement can produce similar results if used again in similar circumstances. For example, if a speedometer gave the same readings at the same speed it would be reliable. If it didn't it would be pretty useless and unreliable. Importantly reliability of self-report measures, such as psychometric tests and questionnaires can be assessed using the split half method. This involves splitting a test into two and having the same participant doing both halves of the test. Validity Validity refers to whether a study measures or examines what it claims to measure or examine. Questionnaires are said to often lack validity for a number of reasons. Participants may lie; give answers that are desired and so on. A way of assessing the validity of self-report measures is to compare the results of the self-report with another self-report on the same topic. (This is called concurrent validity). For example if an interview is used to investigate sixth grade students' attitudes toward smoking, the scores could be compared with a questionnaire of former sixth graders' attitudes toward smoking. Results of self-report studies have been confirmed by other methods. For example, results of prior self-reported outcomes were confirmed by studies involving smaller participant population using direct observation strategies. The overarching question asked regarding this strategy is, \\"Why would the researcher trust what people say about themselves?\\" In case, however, when there is a challenge to the validity of collected data, there are research tools that can be used to address the problem of respondent bias in self-report studies. These include the construction of some inventories to minimize respondent distortions such as the use of scales to assess the attitude of the participant, measure personal bias, as well as identify the level of resistance, confusion, and insufficiency of self-reporting time, among others. Leading questions could also be avoided, open questions could be added to allow respondents to expand upon their replies and confidentiality could be reinforced to allow respondents to give more truthful responses.  Disadvantages  Self-report studies have many advantages, but they also suffer from specific disadvantages due to the way that subjects generally behave. Self-reported answers may be exaggerated; respondents may be too embarrassed to reveal private details; various biases may affect the results, like social desirability bias. There are also cases when respondents guess the hypothesis of the study and provide biased responses that 1) confirm the researcher's conjecture; 2) make them look good; or, 3) make them appear more distressed to receive promised services. Subjects may also forget pertinent details. Self-report studies are inherently biased by the person's feelings at the time they filled out the questionnaire. If a person feels bad at the time they fill out the questionnaire, for example, their answers will be more negative. If the person feels good at the time, then the answers will be more positive. As with all studies relying on voluntary participation, results can be biased by a lack of respondents, if there are systematic differences between people who respond and people who do not. Care must be taken to avoid biases due to interviewers and their demand characteristics.

It was dissolved in 1791. History The abbey was founded in 1113 by Stephen Harding as the first daughter house of C√Æteaux Abbey, the mother house of the Cistercian reform. Along with Morimond Abbey, Clairvaux Abbey and Pontigny Abbey it was one of the four primary abbeys of the Cistercian order to which all other Cistercian houses were affiliated. It stood on a wild site located between the forest of Bragny and the swampy land of the Grosne. It benefitted greatly from the generosity of the entourage of the Dukes of Burgundy and of the local nobility, especially the family of Gros de Brancion, and rapidly gained wealth and importance. In 1165-66 it was caught up in the conflicts between Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, and Counts Gerard of M√¢con and William of Chalon. The conventual buildings were reconstructed in the 13th century. In 1362 the abbey was occupied by the roaming brigands known as the Tard-Venus. It was fortified in 1415, but this did not prevent it from being looted in 1562 und 1567. In 1570 it was set on fire by the Protestant troops of Gaspard de Coligny; the only buildings to survive were the church, the sacristy, the chapter house and an adjoining room. The abbot Fran√ßois de Beugre obtained permission in 1574 to sell lands in order to fund the rebuilding. The final works - the construction of the dormitory and the redecoration of the church - were completed in the early 17th century under his successor, Yves Sauvageot. In 1682 the abbot Claude Petit refurbished the abbot's lodgings and the cloister, while the fortification wall was demolished and the defensive ditch filled in. Further works were undertaken by the abbot Fran√ßois Filzjean de Chemilly in about 1760, principally to the frontage of the abbot's residence, which bears his arms. The last abbot, Antoine-Louis Desvignes de la Cerve, commissioned a scheme of interior redecoration from the local architect Rameau, for which he granted him a pension. The abbey was dissolved in 1791 during the French Revolution, by which time the community numbered only 14 monks, and some of the outbuildings were occupied by the workers, some of them women, from the cotton factory which had been established elsewhere on the site. The buildings were sold as national assets and largely destroyed, including the abbey church. Present Front elevation of the Ch√¢teau de la Fert√© The only substantial survival of the premises is the 18th century abbot's house, now known as the Ch√¢teau de la Fert√©, built on a slight elevation, with a two- storey central block of three bays, wings of four bays with mansard roofs and corner blocks of two bays. This building contains the original monastic refectory. It was listed as a monument historique in 1993. Ch√¢teau de la Fert√©-sur-Grosne, ancienne abbaye cistercienne  Daughter houses La Fert√© was the direct founder of five daughter houses: * Maizi√®res Abbey in France (with its daughter house Sturzelbronn Abbey) * Tiglieto Abbey in Italy (with its daughter houses Staffarda Abbey and Casanova Abbey) * Lucedio Abbey in Italy (with its daughter houses Rivalta Scrivia Abbey, Chortaiton Abbey in Greece and the Abbey of St George, Jubin near Antioch in Turkey) * Barona Abbey in Italy * St Sergius's Abbey in the Lebanon List of abbots *1113‚Äì1117 : Philibert *1117‚Äì1123 : Obizon *1123‚Äì1132 : Pierre I *1132‚Äì1171 : Barth√©l√©my I *1171‚Äì1178 : Guillaume I *1178‚Äì1194 : Herv√© de Faverney *1194‚Äì1199 : Bruno I *1198‚Äì1199 : Guillaume II *1199‚Äì1201 : Nicolas *1203‚Äì1205 : Eudes *1205‚Äì1206 : Pierre II *1206‚Äì1229 : Simon *1230‚Äì1232 : Boniface *1232‚Äì1233 : Vincent *1233‚Äì1234 : Guillaume III *1234‚Äì1239 : Robert *1239‚Äì1266 : Barth√©l√©my II *1266‚Äì1276 : Jean I *1276‚Äì1285 : G√©rard *1285‚Äì1297 : Rufin *1287‚Äì1317 : Pierre III de Montcalier *1317‚Äì1321 : Huges *1321‚Äì1341 : Jean II de Marcilly *1341‚Äì1346 : Bruno II *1346‚Äì1357 : Durand de Marcilly *1357‚Äì1371 : Claude I *1371‚Äì1385 : Pierre IV de Marcilly *1385‚Äì1392 : Guy de Saint-Romain *1392‚Äì1412 : Etienne I de La Ch√®ze *1412‚Äì1416 : Guillaume IV *1416‚Äì1419 : Etienne II de Marcilly *1419‚Äì1439 : Jean III de Beaune *1439‚Äì1470 : Jean IV de Saint-Pierre *1470‚Äì1506 : Claude II de Dinteville *1506‚Äì1549 : Antoine I de Vienne *1549‚Äì1567 : Ren√© Dantoncour *1567‚Äì1569 : Elz√©ar de Rastel *1569‚Äì1574 : Louis de Breschard *1574‚Äì1600 : Fran√ßois I de Beugre *1600‚Äì1655 : Yves Sauvageot *1655‚Äì1677 : Pierre V Bouchu *1677‚Äì1710 : Claude III Petit *1710‚Äì1725 : Jean-Marie Vernois de Montjournal *1725‚Äì1733 : Jean-Charles Descriveux *1733‚Äì1761 : Fran√ßois II Filzjean de Chemilly *1761‚Äì1783 : Fran√ßois III Claude-Gaspard de Cannablin *1783‚Äì1791 : Antoine II Louis Desvignes de La Cerve NotesSources and external links *Abbaye de la Fert√© *Certosa di Firenze: La Fert√© *Cistercium: La Fert√© * Auberger, Jean-Baptiste, 2000: La Fert√©, in: Andr√© Vauchez (ed.), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages.

The film stars Andr√©s Pazos, Mirella Pascual, Jorge Bolani, Ana Katz, and Daniel Hendler. It has very sparse dialogue and the three principal actors play very straight roles showing little emotion. It was premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Un Certain Regard and FIPRESCI Awards. Plot On the first anniversary of his mother's death, Jacobo (Andres Pazos), the owner of a small and struggling sock factory, asks one of his attentive employees, Marta (Mirella Pascual), to spend a few days at his home pretending to be his wife because his brother, Herman (Jorge Bolani), is arriving for a visit. Jacobo and Marta's lives are very dull and repetitious. It takes some time to realize that Jacobo asks Marta because he has no one else to ask. Why Marta agrees is another matter. Jacobo is aware that his brother has become more successful since moving away and possibly resents the time that he had to devote to nursing their dying mother, rather than working on his own business. Herman's visit is initially an uneasy time for the two brothers who clearly have little in common, however, shortly before he is due to return home, Herman asks Jacobo and Marta to accompany him on a visit to a resort in Piri√°polis where they spent time as children with their parents. Marta is keen to go and Jacobo reluctantly agrees. During the holiday Marta and Herman become closer and the suggestion develops that they may actually have feelings for each other. Jacobo remains cold and unemotional towards both the other characters and seems keen for the experience to end. Just before he is due to go home Herman gives Jacobo a sum of money as compensation for the time that he lost by having to care for their mother. Jacobo is initially unwilling to accept it, but takes the money after witnessing Herman sing a love song towards Marta in a Karaoke restaurant that the three visit. Later that night Jacobo goes alone to a casino, placing all the money on Black 24 in a game of roulette and wins. He keeps some of the money, but wraps the larger part up as a present. As they say goodbye to Herman, Marta presses a note into his hand telling him to read it on the plane. When they get back home, Jacobo calls a taxi for Marta and gives her the cash present which she is last seen holding in the back of the cab. The following morning she does not turn up for work, although Jacobo goes through the same routine as always. CastExhibition The film was first presented at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on May 19.

The NHL shield on the front was enlarged, while the logos on the shoulders remained the same. The striping was reduced to two thin stripes, orange over black, separated by a thin white stripe. The names on the back remained in black with orange trim, and the numerals remained orange with black trim. The Soviet team used their standard red national uniforms, which they also used when touring against the teams of the World Hockey Association (while billed as the \\"Soviet All- Stars\\"). The jerseys featured two white stripes at the waistline - one thin stripe over a wider stripe studded with red diamonds. The sleeve stripes followed a similar pattern, but without the diamonds on the wide stripes, and an additional white stripe below the wide band. While the Soviet team normally used Cyrillic script on its uniforms, the names on the back of the jerseys for the Challenge Cup were romanized for the event. The front of the jerseys retained the Cyrillic –°–°–°–† initials.

He managed to live a fully Jewish religious life even under Stalin's rule. He served as mohel and shochet. He often fasted and immersed himself many times daily in water that was sometimes only accessible by chopping away very thick ice. His Tikkun Chatzos (midnight prayer service) in sackcloth and ashes regularly lasted 6‚Äì7 hours, sometimes stretching as long as 12. He cried so much during Tikkun Chatzos that when he was done, the tears and ashes mingled so that he was sitting in mud. Abramowitz left the Soviet Union in 1970 and moved to the Mattersdorf section of Jerusalem, where he lived for a few years before moving to the United States. He lived in Miami, Los Angeles, and Sea Gate, Brooklyn, before he finally settled in Monsey, New York, where he died on Isru Chag (Succos). He was believed to be 92 or 93 years old.

It keeps an up-to-date register of all qualified dentists and other dental care professionals such as: dental hygienists, dental therapists, dental nurses, dental technicians and clinical dental technicians. It was established in 1956 to set and maintain standards in UK dentistry, with the aims of protecting the general public from unqualified dental professionals. Its headquarters are in Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London. The General Dental Council has also stated that it aims to promote confidence in dental professionals and to be at the forefront of health care regulation. The GDC is tasked with ensuring that all dental professionals maintain up to date knowledge, controlling the quality of dental education in the country, ensuring a proper quality of care is given to the patients, and helping any patient who has questions or complaints. It is meant to act as a bridge of communication between the government, public and the dental professionals. The General Dental Council is entirely funded by the profession it regulates. Registration of dental care professionals The professions that the GDC include in the dental care professionals group are: dental nurse, dental technician, dental therapist, dental hygienist, orthodontic therapist and clinical dental technician. On 31 July 2006 it became possible for dental nurses to voluntarily join the GDC register and in July 2008 it became a mandatory requirement. Overseas Registration Exam The Overseas Registration Exam (ORE) is administered by the GDC, and is designed to test the knowledge, skills and professionalism of candidates against the standard expected of graduate dentists on first registration with the General Dental Council (GDC). This means that UK graduates and overseas dentists are expected to have the same basic level of knowledge and skills. The ORE has two parts which must be taken ‚Äì and passed ‚Äì in order. The purpose of Part 1 is to test the candidates' application of knowledge to clinical practice and Part 2 is designed for candidates to demonstrate practical clinical skills. Council From 1 October 2013 the Council has consisted of 12 members who are all appointed: 6 registrants and 6 lay members. The changes were specified in the General Dental Council (Constitution) (Amendment) Order 2012 that was made in July 2012. The new Council took office on 1 October 2013, supported by other new governance arrangements. The Council is led by the first appointed Chair of the GDC, Bill Moyes, who took up office on 1 October 2013. Mr Moyes currently holds non-executive directorships with the Office of Fair Trading, the Priory Hospital Group, and the Legal Services Board. He is a trustee of the Catholic Trust of England and Wales and chairman of the boardof Governors of Heythrop College, a constituent college of the University of London. He was previously Executive Chairman of Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts from 2004 to 2010, during the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust Scandal and Director General of the British Retail Consortium from 2000 to 2003. History It was established in 1956 by an amendment to the Dentists Act 1948, now updated in the Dentists Act 1984. The Council was originally set up in 1956 with 50 members but has been restructured, with the number of members decreasing each time. On 1 October 2009, a smaller fully appointed Council took office with 24 members and a balance of 12 lay and 12 professional. The last Chair of the GDC to be elected was qualified dentist Kevin O'Brien who was in post from 21 September 2011 to 30 September 2013. In October 2013 further restructuring occurred.  Oversight of health and social care regulators  The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA), is an independent body accountable to the UK Parliament, which promotes the health and wellbeing of the public and oversees the nine UK healthcare regulators, including the General Dental Council. The PSA review the performance of all regulators on an annual basis, identifying where things are being done well and where improvements can be made. The PSA review all final decisions made by fitness to practise committees. The PSA audit the initial stages of fitness to practise processes to examine whether the regulator is using effective decision-making processes.  Criticism  Concerns about cost-effectiveness, levels of confidence in the GDC and cost-effectiveness of fitness to practise procedures were put to the CEO Evlynne Gilvarry by the BDA in an interview that was published in September 2014.  Annual Retention Fees  The GDC recently ran a consultation on the Annual Retention Fee (ARF) policy, which was open from 16 April until 4 June 2014. The GDC had received over 4000 responses to the consultation on the proposed 64% rise in the Annual Retention, fee, and 97% of responses were critical of the rise. The BDA took the step of appointing Forensic Accountants to analyse the figures presented by the GDC as justification for the rise. The subsequent report was quoted as being 'Damning' and resulted in the GDC having to engage KPMG to assess the figures which had been presented as evidence. In September 2014 the GDC's proposed increase in Annual Retention Fees led to threats of legal action from the British Dental Association, the trade union and representative body of UK dentists. The Professional Standards Authority assessed the GDC‚Äôs performance against its Standards of Good Regulation and judged that the GDC met 23 out of 24 of the Standards in 2016-17.  Fitness to practise process The initial stages of the GDC's fitness to practise process were audited by the PSA with the findings published in December 2013. Dental Protection Limited have been highly critical of the way in which the GDC approach the Fitness to Practise Proceedings that are the disciplinary hearings Dentists have to undergo. The PSA announced in May 2014 that it would be undertaking an investigation of the management and support processes of the General Dental Council's Investigating Committee.

They're aided by their assigned mentor and guardian, pop idol witch Rockin' Robin, and their two animal familiars, Blanca the mouse and Duke the frog. But the girls have more to deal with than just competing for hearts at school. There's something weird about the cool, mysterious middle school boy Pierre, who resembles the evil king Glace‚Äîand he seems to be after Chocola. Now, both trapped within their own new goals, the two witches must fight their way and retain a friendship which no magic can defeat. Characters ; : : Chocola is a beautiful and very energetic girl with a forceful personality. She is best friends with Vanilla and is the daughter of the so called, late witch Cinnamon. She has long orange hair, large emerald green eyes, and pointy ears. In the human world, she is not as popular as Vanilla since her temper makes most boys wary, but she is able to make friends with them instead. Her energetic and cheerful personality makes her very popular in the Magical World, and at the beginning of the series she finds the switch between her and Vanilla's popularity in the human world harrowing. She is very caring and a loyal friend, but she can be very aggressive and prideful. She is secretly in love with Pierre. Her familiar is a lazy but powerful frog named Duke. In her world, she lives with her grandfather, Corne, a powerful wizard who, like Chocola, has a certain dislike for Blanca. As the series progresses, Chocola and Pierre develop feelings for each other and (in the anime) end up exchanging hearts and sharing their first kisses. In the anime, she loses the queen contest but Vanilla gives up the throne (making Chocolat Queen). In the manga, Chocola and Pierre went missing and lost their memories which made them return a few years later, for Vanilla's coronation. ; : : Vanilla is a beautiful, shy and gentle girl. Best friends with Chocola, she is the daughter of Queen Candy. Blanca is her familiar. She has short blond curly hair, purple eyes, and pointy ears. Because of her compassion, empathy, and cuteness, she is more popular than Chocola with human boys, which leads Chocola to believe that the Human World and the Magic World are opposites. Vanilla was less popular in the Magical World than Chocola, due to her shy personality. Vanilla is also more conscientious, and more dutiful than Chocola. However, in the third volume Chocola is able to beat her in getting hearts sometimes. About midway through the series, Vanilla feels insecure and inferior to Chocola and becomes Ogre Princess due to Pierre's trickery. Chocola is able to save her. In the anime, Vanilla wins the crown but gives it to Chocola. In the last volume of the manga, Vanilla wins the right to be Queen, but refuses to take the crown. She finally accepts the crown because Chocola is missing. After Chocola is found, she still retains her position as Queen upon Chocola's wish. She ends up with Houx. ; : : Rockin' Robin is the mentor of Vanilla and Chocola. He also records their progress in stealing hearts. He is a popular rock star in the Human World (\\"Rockin' Robin\\" and \\"Rock'n Lovin'\\" have the same spelling in katakana). Although he may seem a bit rude, he has a caring heart, although he rarely displays it. According to Blanca, Robin is actually 6800 years old and uses facial masks to retain a youthful appearance. He seems to be particularly afraid of sharp objects. In the manga, he sacrifices himself for Chocola in the final battle. ; : : Duke is a red and black striped frog who is the Chocola's familiar. He helps her steal hearts, but isn't much help at the beginning. He has a rivalry with Blanca. Mostly, he is quite lazy and rude, and has an extensive knowledge about hearts, which proves useful later. Duke is actually Chocola's uncle, the little brother of Cinnamon, who was transformed into a frog. He tells Queen Candy that he turned himself into a frog to pose as a familiar, as he was wanted by the authorities after he concealed Cinnamon when she was on the run. However, his transformation worked too well, and his magical power as a familiar became too weak to allow him to transform back. At the end of Volume 6 he is returned to his human form via a white heart. ; : : Blanca is a magical mouse and the familiar of Vanilla. In the story, she helps Vanilla win at first. She enjoys teasing Chocola, Duke, and almost anyone who annoys her. She also likes tea parties with her mice friends. Chocola calls her \\"Rat\\". Even though she has a very bitter relationship with Chocola, there are times when she can show her soft side towards her. In the manga, she was originally a witch named Libbie who ran a salon in the Magical World, but was turned into a familiar when she fell in love with a human and lost her heart. She is turned back into her original form with the power of Pierre's (now white) heart. ; : : Pierre is a popular and handsome boy at Chocola's school, but he has a cold heart, and is not as innocent as he looks. He's the captain of the fencing and tennis teams of the school and has a fan club of beautiful but cruel and cold junior-high student girls known as 'The Members', who dislike Chocola being near their Prince. His magical ability is high, as well as his physical strength and capability. Almost nobody can resist his charisma and charm, and many human girls in Chocola's school are in love with him. He has white blonde hair and ice blue eyes, and is taller than most people in his class. : It is discovered in Volume 2, that Pierre is also from the magical world when he almost takes Chocola's heart. When he was a little boy the ogres kidnapped him and made him the Ogre Prince, so he didn't choose becoming that and wasn't born as an Ogre. As the story goes on, Pierre begins to fall in love with Chocola, as does she. He has huge feelings for her and claims that he doesn't know why he can not leave her alone and \\"involuntarily\\" risks his life to save her many times. Pierre's noir heart conflicts with a pink heart. In the anime, they exchange hearts. In the manga, Pierre and Chocola go missing for years after the last battle, with severe amnesia. Once they regain their memories, they manage to be in time for Vanilla's coronation and reunite with her, as well as their other friends. They depart to the humans' world to start a new life, and Pierre's heart is shown to be red for Chocola. ; and : Twin brothers who are close childhood friends with Chocola and Vanilla from the Magical World. They both have quite brash personalities that can sometimes land them into trouble. They both come to the Human World as new students in Chocola and Vanilla's school to protect them. Both of them have a strong liking towards Chocola, arguing about who will be Chocola's King when she gets the crown. Turns out that Houx fell in love with Vanilla. ; : The Queen of the Magical World and Vanilla's mother. Even though Vanilla's mother is a queen, she kept a careful eye on the Queen Candidate and the Queen Candidacy so that the ogres could not interfere again. In the anime, she loses the Queen Candidacy, but after the sacrifice made by Cinnamon for the Magical World, the throne was given to her after replacing Cinnamon's place. In the manga, she sacrifices herself at the end to help Chocola defeat Glac√©, acknowledging Chocola as the Magical World's Queen. ; : Chocola's mother and a famous witch. She was a previous Queen Candidate along with Candy Mieux, she won the candidacy, however she sacrificed the throne for the freedom to save the Magic World. Under circumstances not clearly explained in the manga, Cinnamon went to visit Glac√©, the grand duke of darkness, while Candy took over as queen. In Volume 7, it is revealed that Cinnamon had Chocola around this time, and that Chocola's father is the King of the Ogres himself. Cinnamon was actually Pierre's familiar who had her voice taken away. Cinnamon fights against Glac√© at the end of Volume 8, but stays behind with him as he fades away. She is disguised as a black cat that Pierre is sometimes seen with. In the last episode, when the queen is decided, she asks Robin and Glacier to help her take care of Chocola. It is said that Cinnamon and Candy were friends during the Queen candidacy. Candy never collected hearts no matter how popular she was. Some say she intentionally did that, feeling that Cinnamon would make the better Queen. ; : Waffle's an anime only character, an immature but kind young witch girl that's always trying to get Houx's affection. In the series, she always caused trouble during the adventures of Chocola and others. At the start, she has a certain dislike for Chocola, for that reason she'll steal Houx from her. She's always accompanied by her devoted nanny and travels around in a huge squirrel-looking flying animal. Media=Manga The eight-volume manga was written and illustrated by Moyoco Anno. In comparison to the anime, which ended before its serialization in Nakayoshi, the manga more strongly emphasizes the struggle between the witches and the ogres. It was initially published in English by Del Rey Manga, but Udon Entertainment currently has the rights. Anime In 2005, Sugar Sugar Rune was adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot under the direction of Matsushita Yukihiro. Consisting of fifty-one episodes with scripts composed by Reiko Yoshida and music by Yasuharu Konishi, the series was broadcast on TV Tokyo in Japan between July 2, 2005 and June 24, 2006. Three pieces of theme music are used‚Äîone opening theme and two closing themes. The opening theme is by Karia Nomoto. The closing theme for the first twenty-nine episodes is by Karia Nomoto and the last twenty episodes is by the series starring voice actresses Marika Matsumoto and Juri Ibata. Reception Sugar Sugar Rune won the 29th Kodansha Manga Awards in the children's manga category. It was called \\"the greatest fantasy comic of the last five years\\" by an Anime News Network reviewer, who praised its stylish art and epic conclusion.

Compared to information integration, which involves merging information having different schemas and representation models, knowledge integration focuses more on synthesizing the understanding of a given subject from different perspectives. For example, multiple interpretations are possible of a set of student grades, typically each from a certain perspective. An overall, integrated view and understanding of this information can be achieved if these interpretations can be put under a common model, say, a student performance index. The Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE), from the University of California at Berkeley has been developed along the lines of knowledge integration theory. Knowledge integration has also been studied as the process of incorporating new information into a body of existing knowledge with an interdisciplinary approach. This process involves determining how the new information and the existing knowledge interact, how existing knowledge should be modified to accommodate the new information, and how the new information should be modified in light of the existing knowledge. A learning agent that actively investigates the consequences of new information can detect and exploit a variety of learning opportunities; e.g., to resolve knowledge conflicts and to fill knowledge gaps. By exploiting these learning opportunities the learning agent is able to learn beyond the explicit content of the new information. The machine learning program KI, developed by Murray and Porter at the University of Texas at Austin, was created to study the use of automated and semi- automated knowledge integration to assist knowledge engineers constructing a large knowledge base. A possible technique which can be used is semantic matching. More recently, a technique useful to minimize the effort in mapping validation and visualization has been presented which is based on Minimal Mappings. Minimal mappings are high quality mappings such that i) all the other mappings can be computed from them in time linear in the size of the input graphs, and ii) none of them can be dropped without losing property i). The University of Waterloo operates a Bachelor of Knowledge Integration undergraduate degree program as an academic major or minor. The program started in 2008.

There is only one species, Longisquama insignis, known from a poorly preserved skeleton and several incomplete fossil impressions from the Middle to Late Triassic Madygen Formation in Kyrgyzstan. It is known from a type fossil specimen, slab and counterslab (PIN 2548/4 and PIN 2584/5) and five referred specimens of possible integumentary appendages (PIN 2584/7 through 9). All specimens are in the collection of the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Longisquama means \\"long scales\\"; the specific name insignis refers to its small size. The Longisquama holotype is notable for a number of long structures that appear to grow from its skin. The current opinion is that Longisquama is an ambiguous diapsid and has no bearing on the origin of birds. History=Interpretation Back structures hypothetically shown in pairs Researchers Haubold and Buffetaut believed that the structures were long, modified scales attached in pairs to the lateral walls of the body, like paired gliding membranes. They published a reconstruction of Longisquama with plumes in a pattern akin to gliding lizards like Draco species and Kuehneosaurus, allowing it to glide, or at least parachute. Though the reconstruction is now thought to have been inaccurate, versions of it are still often seen on the Internet and elsewhere. Other researchers place the scales differently. Unwin and Benton interpreted them as a single, unpaired row of modified scales that run along the dorsal midline. Jones et al. interpreted them as two paired rows of structures that are anatomically very much like feathers, and which are in positions like those of birds' spinal feather tracts. Feather-development expert Richard Prum (and also Reisz and Sues) see the structures as anatomically very different from feathers, and thinks they are elongate, ribbonlike scales. Still other observers (e.g. Fraser in 2006) believe that the structures are not part of Longisquama at all, that they are simply plant fronds that were preserved along with the reptile and were misinterpreted. Buchwitz & Voigt (2012) argue that the structures of Longisquama are not plant remains, because all of the structures except for the last in the holotype PIN 2584/4 are arranged regularly, and that they are not preserved as carbon films, the usual mode of preservation for plants in the Madygen Formation. The only plant from Madygen with similarities to the Longisquama structures is Mesenteriophyllum kotschnevii, but its leaves do not have the distinct hockey-stick shape of the structures attributed to Longisquama. Description=Integumentary structures Restoration Longisquama is characterized by distinctive integumentary structures along its back. The holotype (specimen PIN 2584/4) is the only known fossil preserving these appendages projecting from the back of an associated skeleton. It has seven appendages radiating in a fan-like pattern, but the tips are not preserved. PIN 2584/9 preserves five complete appendages spaced close together. PIN 2584/6 preserves two long, curved appendage running side by side. Other specimens, such as PIN 2585/7 and FG 596/V/1, preserve only one appendage. These structures are long and narrow throughout most of their lengths, and angle backward near the tip to give the appearance of a hockey stick. The proximal straight section is divided into three longitudinal lobes: a smooth lobe on either side and a transversely ridged lobe running between them. The middle ridged lobe is made up of raised \\"rugae\\" and deep \\"interstices\\", which Sharov compared to rosary beads. The distal section is thought to be an extension of the middle and anterior lobes of the proximal section. While the anterior lobe widens in the distal section, the posterior lobe of the proximal section narrows until it ends at the base of the distal section. In addition, an \\"anterior flange\\" appears about two- thirds the way up the proximal section and continues to the tip of the distal section. Both lobes in the distal section are ridged and separated by a grooved axis. In some specimens, the rugae of either lobe in the distal section line up with each other, while in other specimens they do not. Some specimens have straight rugae projecting perpendicular to the axis, while others have rugae that curve in an S-shape. One specimen of Longisquama, PIN 2584/5, has small spines projecting from the axis of the distal section. The holotype skeleton shows each structure attaching to a vertebral spine. These anchorage points are visible as raised knobs. The base of each appendage is slightly convex, unlike the flattened shape of the rest of the structure. The convex shape may be evidence that the base of each structure was tubular in life, anchoring like other integumentary structures such as mammalian hair or avian feathers into a follicle. Moreover, the proximity of each structure to its corresponding vertebra suggests that a thick layer of soft tissue, possibly including a follicle, surrounded each base. Classification Like the 'long scales', the skeletal features of Longisquama are equally difficult to diagnose. As a result, Longisquama has been related by scientists to many different sauropsid groups. Sharov determined that it was a \\"pseudosuchian\\" (a \\"primitive\\" archosaur, but as an archosaur a relatively derived reptile) on the basis of two features: a mandibular fenestra and an antorbital fenestra. Sharov's original description also includes an elongate scapula. Jones et al. see Longisquama as an archosaur, adding to Sharov's two characters a furcula. Olshevsky believes that Longisquama is an archosaur and, moreover, an early dinosaur,Olshevsky, G. 1991. A Revision of the Parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, Excluding the Advanced Crocodylia. Mesozoic Meanderings, 2: 196 pp. a possibility that, if true, could dispense with almost all of the debate about bird origins. Unwin & Benton did not think it was possible to diagnose the crucial fenestrae; the holes could simply be damage to the fossil. They agreed with Sharov that Longisquama has acrodont teeth and an interclavicle, but instead of a furcula, they saw paired clavicles. These features would be more typical of a member of Lepidosauromorpha, meaning that Longisquama is not an archosaur and thus not closely related to birds. According to a cladistic study by Phil Senter in 2004, Longisquama would be an even more basal diapsid and a member of Avicephala, more closely related to Coelurosauravus. A 2012 re-examination of the fossil found that the presence of fenestrae in the skull crucial to classification as an archosaur could not be confirmed; in fact, a section of the skull in one of the fossil slabs that had previously been used to justify the presence of antorbital fenestrae does not contain any actual bone. This study concluded that none of the proposed classifications of Longisquama could be confirmed or refuted using the available evidence. The authors of the study tentatively placed Longisquama among the Archosauromorpha as a result of their hypothesis of developmental \\"deep homology\\" between its plumes, bird feathers, crocodile scales and pterosaur pycnofibres. Debate over bird origins Isolated back structures of paratype specimen PIN 2584/9 The questions relating to the reptilian classification of Longisquama and to the exact function of the 'long scales' relate to a wider debate about the origin of birds, and whether they are descended from dinosaurs. Background A consensus of paleontologists agrees that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs. The scenario for this hypothesis is that early theropod dinosaurs were endothermic, and evolved simple filamentous feathers for insulation. These feathers later increased in size and complexity and then adapted to aerodynamic uses. Ample evidence for this hypothesis has been found in the fossil record, specifically for such dinosaurs as Kulindadromeus, Sinosauropteryx, Caudipteryx, Microraptor and many others. Longisquama is thus regarded as a diapsid with strange scales, ambiguous skeletal features and no real significance to bird evolution. A minority of scientists prefer the hypothesis that birds evolved from small, arboreal archosaurs like Longisquama. They see these as ectothermic animals that adapted to gliding by developing elongated scales and then pennaceous feathers. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by cladistic analysis.

Exterior walls Shiplap is either rough-sawn or milled pine or similarly inexpensive wood between wide with a rabbet on opposite sides of each edge.Shiplap Edge Joints, WoodworkDetails.com The rabbet allows the boards to overlap in this area. The profile of each board partially overlaps that of the board next to it creating a channel that gives shadow line effects, provides excellent weather protection and allows for dimensional movement. Useful for its strength as a supporting member, and its ability to form a relatively tight seal when lapped, shiplap is usually used as a type of siding for buildings that do not require extensive maintenance and must withstand cold and aggressive climates. Rough-sawn shiplap is attached vertically in post and beam construction, usually with 6d-8d common nails, while milled versions, providing a tighter seal, are more commonly placed horizontally, more suited to two-by-four frame construction. Small doors and shutters such as those found in barns and sheds are often constructed of shiplap cut directly from the walls, with only thin members framing or crossing the back for support. Shiplap is also used indoors for the rough or rustic look that it creates when used as paneling or a covering for a wall or ceiling. Shiplap is often used to describe any rabbeted siding material that overlaps in a similar fashion. Interior design In interior design, shiplap is a style of wooden wall siding characterized by long planks, normally painted white, that are mounted horizontally with a slight gap between them in a manner that evokes exterior shiplap walls. A disadvantage of the style is that the gaps are prone to accumulating dust. Installing shiplap horizontally in a room can help carry the eye around the space, making it feel larger. Installing it vertically helps emphasize the height of the room, making it feel larger. It can also be installed on the ceiling, to draw the eye upwards.

He was the four-term commissioner of the Texas General Land Office from 1983 to 1999 during the administrations of Governors Mark White, Bill Clements, Ann Richards, and George W. Bush. He is also known for losing the 1998 Texas gubernatorial election to Bush, who at that time was the incumbent governor seeking re-election. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Life and career Mauro, a native of Bryan, Texas, attended Waco, Texas Reicher Catholic High School. He attended college at Texas A&M; University in College Station. He subsequently attended the University of Texas Law School. Mauro went to work for United States Senator Ralph Yarborough after graduation from law school. He became Executive Director of the Texas Democratic Party by the time he was 30. At 34 in 1982, he was elected to the statewide office of Texas Land Commissioner. Despite being targeted for defeat by the state Republican Party, he was re-elected three times. Mauro became the second longest-serving Land Commissioner in Texas history serving a total of 16 years in office. He is credited by many for bringing new relevance to the office and taking the lead on important issues, including many environmental initiatives. As chairman of the Veteran's Land Board, Mauro pushed legislation passed in 1983 that expanded the investment authority of the board and provided for increased loan ceiling for land and housing. The program was expanded to include certain National Guard personnel. He moved for exceptionally low interest rates, which led to a record number of housing loans for Texas veterans. In 1993, Mauro campaigned to gain voter approval of an additional $500 million in bonds for veterans housing loans and $250 million in bonds for land loans. In 1989, the Texas Legislature approved a Mauro initiative to reduce air pollution and to sell more natural gas. The bill requires fleet operators in larger cities to convert to clean-burning fuels, including compressed natural gas. Mauro was appointed by Speaker Jim Wright to a Task Force that put similar measures in the re-authorization of the Clean Air Act. In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed Mauro to be the Chairman of the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force for Alternative Fuels which further implemented those measures. Also in 1989, the Legislature passed a bill pushed by Mauro to facilitate the recycling of plastics. The bill requires manufacturers to code their plastic items according to resins used. Mauro convinced the U.S. Senate to ratify the Annex V provision of the MARPOL Treaty, which outlaws the dumping of plastic items in the world's oceans. His main objective was to help clean up the Gulf of Mexico and reduce beach litter. His efforts also have resulted in the International Maritime Organization designating the Gulf and the \\"Wider Caribbean\\" as a \\"special area\\" to prohibit ships from dumping anything in the Gulf, with the exception of finely-ground food scraps. In 1991, Mauro played a key role in gaining passage of the Oil Spill Prevention & Response Act which makes the land office the lead state agency for spills in state waters, and coastal management legislation which gives the Land Office a strong hand in matters of environmental consequence along the coast. The 1991 omnibus recycling bill backed by Mauro requires state purchasers to give preference to goods made of recycled materials, set a state goal of recycling 40 percent of the garbage stream, provided for development of standards for collection of household hazardous wastes, and for the recycling of old tires, batteries, and used motor oil. The Land Office made a statewide marketing study to facilitate the development of recycling businesses in the state. In 1992, he served as the Texas State Chairman for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. He took on the same role in 1996 for Clinton-Gore, in 2000 for Al Gore (as a co-chairman) and in 2004 for Dick Gephardt. In 2008 and again in 2016, he served as the Texas State Director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. After leaving office in 1999, he was appointed to the Fannie Mae Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton. He is referenced in Bill Clinton's 2004 memoir My Life. Mauro met the future President and First Lady in 1972 while working on George McGovern's presidential campaign in Austin. Mauro is the author of the memoir Beaches, Bureaucrats & Big Oil: One Man's Fight for Texas. The book was published in 1997. Mauro is a licensed attorney in Texas and the District of Columbia. He serves as Chairman of the Board for LifeVantage Corporation. He holds a Series 6 & 7 Securities license and is a Managing Director for EntrustPermal. Mauro lives in Austin, Texas and has 5 children.

Young, a history buff, was inspired by Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs \\"Thirteen Virtues,\\" a copy of which was included with the CD, and distressed by the Republican Party‚Äôs efforts to leverage ‚Äúmoral virtues‚Äù during the 2004 presidential election. The anthemic title track, composed with Will Kimbrough, served as a mission statement of sorts for Young, both personally and professionally, and Franklin‚Äôs influence is apparent right from the opening lines: \\"Gonna start a revolution / made of action, not of words / Practicing the art of virtue / A Joyride on the learning curve.\\" Based in part on the positive response to her 2004 debut release, Plow to the End of the Row, Young was able to attract many of Nashville‚Äôs top session players including members of The Del McCoury Band to play on the CD. The result was a noticeably more polished and professional sound that Young and her band, Little Sadie, would hone live in extensive touring throughout the latter half of the year. With the new incarnation of Little Sadie (fiddler and banjoist Eric Merrill, guitarist Hans Holzen, bassist Kyle Kegerreis and percussionist Eric Platz), Young appeared at many major music festivals including the New Jersey Folk Festival, the Greyfox Bluegrass Festival, and the second annual Dead on the Creek Festival, held in Willits, California to honor Grateful Dead singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia. Alongside the original songs and traditional tunes, The Art of Virtue featured a cover of the Grateful Dead's \\"Brokedown Palace.\\" Young's AddieBelle label struck a distribution deal with Ryko Records which insured that her music got placed in more record stores. Young used the release of the CD and subsequent concert tour to call attention to her involvement with the Food Routes Network, a non-profit organization that promotes sustainable agriculture and connects consumers with local farmers who are willing to sell direct. The Art of Virtue placed third in Amazon.com's list of the best folk recordings of the year and was placed on numerous year-end best-of lists including the Americana Music Association, Boston Herald, Cape Cod Times, and Nashville Scene. Appropriately, Young was invited to sing in Philadelphia on January 17, 2006 as part of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday celebration.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) for most of his career and served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (1910‚Äì1917) and House of Representatives (1929‚Äì1931). Early life Cusack was born at Bellevale near Yass, New South Wales and had some schooling in Yass. He was apprenticed at 15 to a blacksmith at Berrima. He learnt about coachbuilding in Sydney and returned to Yass in 1898 to marry Minnie Cassidy and start a coachbuilding business. He was elected to Yass Municipal Council and was mayor in 1904. Parliamentary career John Cusack Cusack established a branch of the Labor League (the predecessor of the Labor Party) in Yass in the 1890s. He represented Queanbeyan from 1910 to 1913 and Albury from 1913 to 1917 in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He was one of only four Labor members to hold the seat of Albury. Following the ALP split of 1916, he was expelled from the party for failing to support a no-confidence motion against the new government formed by ALP defector William Holman. However, he was later readmitted. In 1929, Cusack was elected to the House of Representatives for Eden-Monaro, surviving a petition by his defeated opponent John Perkins. He attempted to switch to Cowper at the 1931 election but was defeated by Earle Page. He stood unsuccessfully for several state elections up to 1953, when he failed, at age 80, as an Independent, to unseat the sitting Labor member for Burrinjuck, Billy Sheahan. After the election, Cusack accused Sheahan, then NSW Attorney General, of \\"assist[ing] a masonic vendetta\\" against him. In 1954, as a senile figure lacking credibility, he also contested the federal lower-house seat of Australian Capital Territory. Later life After his earlier electoral defeats, Cusack returned to his work as a blacksmith in Yass. He died in the old Canberra Hospital and was survived by his wife, three sons (Linton, Stan and Greg) and a daughter (Ursula). His son Stan established a successful furniture business in Canberra, following the development of the area as the Australian Capital Territory. Dymphna Cusack was his niece. His great-granddaughter Catherine Cusack was elected as a Liberal Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council in 2003.

It provides an education rooted in classical Christian education to students in grades 6-12. The curriculum emphasizes wonder and inquiry through the use of original texts, hands-on activities, participation in arts studio, choir, and drama, as well as in mathematics and language, including Latin. Located at 601 River Ridge Parkway, Suite 200, in Eagan, Minnesota 55121, this 1996, 2008, and 2019 Blue Ribbon school is accredited by North Central Association and Independent School Association of the Central States (NCA/ISACS). The River Ridge campus was founded in 1987 by the People of Praise, a Christian community. It is owned and operated by Trinity Schools, Inc, based in South Bend, Indiana. The River Ridge campus has two sister schools, Greenlawn in South Bend and Meadow View in Falls Church, Virginia. Philosophy of Education The two principles on which education is based in Trinity Schools are the role of the student as the primary agent of learning, and the community of learners in which the faculty lives on a daily basis. The primary agent in education is the human person, and the primary goal of an educational institution is human awakening.{Maritain, 1943. Education at the Crossroads. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1943} The human person must be awakened to a purpose. The faculty is a community of learners, in which the faculty are foremost learners, and secondarily, teachers. For example, there is one faculty room in which all teachers have desks, and no homerooms. The faculty meet for seminars four times a year; two per semester. The purpose is to read original works, such as The Secret History by Donna Tartt, Four Colors Suffice by Robin Wilson,Robin Wilson (mathematician) or watch movies such as Terrence Malick's Tree of Life. The faculty also participate in faculty colloquia, which focus on presentations by faculty on their interests, or movies of interest. Upon their graduation, the seniors ar welcomed into the community of learners. Trinity Schools are faculty led. The Head of School, Deans of Boys and Girls, and Academic Dean, are all members of the faculty. Although the business, admission, and development staff are distinct from the faculty, they are an integral part of the schools, and their work is overseen by the Head of School. History River Ridge, the second campus of Trinity Schools, Inc., opened in the Twin Cities in 1987 with 6 teachers and 31 students, using rented facilities at Gethsemane Episcopal Church, in downtown Minneapolis, MN. Dan Ferris served as head of school. In 1991 the school moved from its downtown Minneapolis site to Bloomington, Minnesota, after purchasing a building (itself a former school) from Control Data Corporation.https://www.bloomington.k12.mn.us/node/3130094 In 1991, when William Wacker became headmaster, the school had grown to 112 students and 18 teachers. The school expanded to two sections of boys and two of girls in 1995, starting with grade 7. In December, 2007, the River Ridge campus relocated to a new, custom-built campus in Eagan, Minnesota.https://peopleofpraise.org/media/thevine/2008-03-vine-and- branches.pdf Jon Balsbaugh became head of school in Fall, 2009. In Fall, 2016, the school added a 6th grade.http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs160/1103123744675/archive/1123537568312.html Beth Schmitz, a long-serving member of the faculty, took on the position of head of school in Fall, 2017.https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5831 Jon Balsbaugh succeeded Dr Kerry Koller as President of Trinity Schools, Inc.https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5697http://sunthisweek.com/2017/03/08/education- briefs-for-the-week-of-march-10/ The 2007 Move In 2005, runway expansion at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport resulted in noise levels greater than 65 decibels on the River Ridge campus in Bloomington. The Metropolitan Airports Commission offered a grant to Trinity School of approximately $7M either to install soundproofing or to help in a move to a new location. Trinity School accepted the grant and selected a new site in Eagan, a nearby suburb, near the intersection of Argenta Trail and Interstate 494. The board of governors of the People of Praise authorized a fund-raising campaign and approved a construction plan for the new campus, which included offices, classrooms, science labs, a commons area, a two-station gym and soccer field. Groundbreaking at the new site occurred at ceremonies on October 19, 2006. The move from the Bloomington campus to the Eagan campus took place in December, 2007, after construction was completed on schedule. Administration Ms. Beth Schmitz is the Head of the School. Mr. Patrick Murphy is the Academic Dean. Mr. Steve Hendrickson is the Dean of Boys, and Ms. Morath is the Dean of Girls.

She was previously a correspondent for the Associated Press, covering intelligence and counterterrorism, and prior to that, a CBS News correspondent for 17 years based mostly overseas. She was stationed in Baghdad as the chief reporter in Iraq for CBS News for nearly three years prior to being critically wounded on May 29, 2006. She is General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership, at the Army War College, Penn State Law and Dickinson College. Biography Dozier was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, one of six siblings, and raised by Benjamin (died 2016), a construction worker and retired Marine who served in World War II, and Dorothy Dozier (died 2008). Dozier attended St. Timothy's School, an all-girls boarding school in Stevenson, Maryland. She holds a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College (1987) and a master's degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia (1993). From 1988 through 1991, Dozier served as a Washington, D.C.-based reporter for The Energy Daily, New Technology Week, and Environment Week, covering congressional policy and industry regulation. From 1992 through 1995, while living in Cairo, Dozier did freelance work for the CBS Radio Network, Christian Science Monitor Radio, and Voice of America, as well as writing for The Washington Post and the San Francisco Chronicle. From 1996 through 1998, Dozier was an anchor for BBC World Service's program titled World Update, an hour-long, live foreign affairs broadcast, among other programs. From 1996 through 2002, Dozier served as the London bureau chief and chief European correspondent for CBS Radio News and as a reporter for CBS News television. Her assignments included the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the crisis and refugee exodus in the Balkans, Vladimir Putin's election, the death of Princess Diana, the Northern Ireland peace process, and the Khobar barracks bombing in Dhahran. She has interviewed dozens of newsmakers, including U.S. Gen. Joseph Dunford, Stan McChrystal (ret.) David Petraeus, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat. Dozier started as a stringer for CBS Radio News, later becoming a network TV correspondent for the CBS Evening News. As part of that progression, from February 2002 through August 2003, Dozier was the chief correspondent for WCBS-TV (New York)'s Middle East bureau in Jerusalem, where she covered the ongoing Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and the war in Iraq, before being hired by CBS anchor Dan Rather and reassigned to Baghdad. After Dozier was injured in Iraq in 2006, CBS gave her temporary assignments covering the Pentagon, the White House and Capitol Hill, for CBS News' Washington, D.C., bureau, from 2007 to 2010, as they were reluctant to let her return to war zones. She left CBS and television reluctantly to become the Intelligence Writer for The Associated Press, to leave the stigma of being combat-injured behind. In April 2008, Dozier received a Peabody award for \\"CBS News Sunday Morning: The Way Home\\", a piece in which she reported the story of two women veterans who lost limbs in Iraq. Dozier received a 2008 RTNDA/Edward R. Murrow Award for Feature Reporting for the same story. She has also received three American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT) Gracie Awards‚Äîin 2000, 2001 and 2002‚Äîfor her radio reports on Mideast violence, Kosovo and the Afghan war, as well as the organization's Grand Gracie Award in 2007 for her body of television work in Iraq. Dozier and ABC News anchor Bob Woodruff were honored with the 2007 Radio and Television News Directors Association and Foundation's Leonard Zeidenberg First Amendment Award. She was honored by the Overseas Press Club in 2007 and spoke on behalf of journalists who have been killed and injured in Iraq. In 2008, Dozier became the first woman to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation's McCrary Award for Excellence in Journalism. Injury in Iraq Dozier was seriously injured in Iraq on May 29, 2006 in a car bomb attack that killed an American soldier, the 4th ID's Captain James \\"Alex\\" Funkhouser, an Iraqi translator, and CBS crewmembers Paul Douglas (Cameraman) and James Brolan (Sound Technician). She was transferred to Germany for further treatment. Most of the patrol was outside their parked Humvees in a residential Baghdad neighborhood. Insurgents waited until the patrol approached the car bomb, packed with an estimated of explosives, before remotely detonating it. The captain, translator and CBS crew were closest to the explosion. Dozier underwent more than two dozen major surgeries in the two months following the bombing. Doctors removed shrapnel from her head, rebuilt her shattered femurs, and applied skin grafts to extensive burns on both legs. Dozier was first treated at the Baghdad Combat Support Hospital, and the medical facility at Balad, Iraq, before being medevacked to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the U.S. military's largest overseas hospital. Although Dozier was unable to speak because she was on a respirator, she was able to write to communicate; the first question she asked regarded the crew. On June 7, 2006, she returned to the United States for further treatment at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Coincidentally, in April 2004, Dozier had been featured in a USA Today article on the safety of journalists covering the Iraq War. Fully recovered from her injuries, Dozier ran the 10K of the 2008 U.S. Marine Corps Marathon to raise money for Fisher House, which provides a place to stay for loved ones of the combat-injured. Proceeds of her 2011 paperback and e-book and funds from speaking to military-related organizations went to a number of charities including NSWKids.org and WoundedWear.org, and/or to donate thousands of copies of her book to patients and families going through similar medical crises. Dozier worked for the Associated Press from 2010 to 2014. Her work has appeared in The Washington Post, Newsweek, The Daily Beast, and Salon. Book Dozier wrote a book, Breathing the Fire: Fighting to Survive, and Get Back to the Fight, which chronicles both her physical and emotional recovery from the IED explosion on Memorial Day 2006 in Iraq. Breathing the Fire was published in May 2008.Dozier, Kimberly. Breathing the Fire: Fighting to Report--and Survive-- the War in Iraq. Des Moines, IA: Meredith Books, 2008. It was reissued in 2011.Dozier, Kimberly. Breathing the Fire: Fighting to Survive, and Get Back to the Fight. East Petersburg, PA: Fox Chapel Pub, 2011. In the book, Dozier pieces together her own memories of the explosion and recovery with reports from her doctors, nurses, family members and even rescuers about her condition. * Breathing the Fire: Fighting to Report--and Survive--the War in Iraq, Meredith Books, 2008, ReferencesExternal links  Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American women war correspondents Category:Associated Press reporters Category:CBS News people Category:CNN people Category:Iraq War casualties Category:Wellesley College alumni Category:Women in the Iraq War Category:Writers from Honolulu Category:American women television journalists ","title":"Kimberly Dozier"},{"id":"4144970","text":"Godfrey of Cambrai (also known as Godfrey of Winchester) was the prior of Winchester Abbey from 1082 until his death in 1107.

Biography  Ho received a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1967 from Hong Kong University, was postdoctoral fellow in biochemical genetics, University of California, San Diego, from 1968 to 1972, senior research fellow in Queen Elizabeth College, lecturer in genetics (from 1976) and reader in biology (from 1985) in the Open University, and since retiring in June 2000 visiting professor of biophysics in Catania University, Sicily. Ho died of cancer in March 2016.http://www.samburcher.com/articles/public-health/109-tribute-to-dr-mae- wan-ho-1941-2016.html  Institute of Science in Society  Ho was a co- founder and director of the Institute of Science in Society (ISIS), an interest group which published fringe articles about climate change, GMOs, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, and water memory. In reviewing the organisation, David Colquhoun accused the ISIS of promoting pseudoscience and specifically criticised Ho's understanding of homeopathy. The institute is on the Quackwatch list of questionable organizations.  Genetic engineering  Ho, together with Joe Cummins of the University of Western Ontario, has argued that a sterility gene engineered into a crop could be transferred to other crops or wild relatives and that \\"This could severely compromise the agronomic performance of conventional crops and cause wild relatives to go extinct\\". They argued that this process could also produce genetic instabilities, which might be \\"leading to catastrophic breakdown\\", and stated that there are no data to assure that this has not happened or cannot happen.Donald MacLeod, \\"Who's listening? Will public opinion on genetically modified crops make any difference to the government?\\", The Guardian, 19 May 2003. Reprint. Accessed 9 June 2008. This concern contrasts with the reason why these sterile plants were developed, which was to prevent the transfer of genes to the environment by preventing any plants that are bred with or that receive these genes from reproducing. Indeed, any gene that caused sterility when transferred to a new species would be eliminated by natural selection and could not spread. Ho expressed concerns about the spread of altered genes through horizontal gene transfer and that the experimental alteration of genetic structures may be out of control. One of her concerns is that the antibiotic resistant gene that was isolated from bacteria and used in some GM crops might cross back from plants by horizontal gene transfer to different species of bacteria, because \\"If this happened it would leave us unable to treat major illnesses like meningitis and E coli.\\"Antony Barnett, \\"GM genes 'jump species barrier', GM food: special report\\", The Guardian, 28 May 2000. Reprint. Accessed 9 June 2008. Her views were published in an opinion article based on a review of others' research. The arguments and conclusions of this article were heavily criticized by prominent plant scientists, and the claims of the article criticized in detail in a response that was published in the same journal, prompting a reply from Ho. A review on the topic published in 2008 in the Annual Review of Plant Biology stated that \\"These speculations have been extensively rebutted by the scientific community\\". Ho has also argued that bacteria could acquire the bacterial gene barnase from transgenic plants. This gene kills any cell that expresses it and lacks barstar, the specific inhibitor of barnase activity. In an article entitled Chronicle of An Ecological Disaster Foretold, which was published in an ISIS newsletter, Ho speculated that if a bacterium acquired the barnase gene and survived, this could make the bacteria a more dangerous pathogen. Evolution Ho has claimed that evolution is pluralistic because there are many mechanisms that can produce variation in phenotypes independently of haphazard mutations. Ho has advocated a form of Lamarckian evolution. She has been criticized by the scientific community for setting up straw man arguments in her criticism of natural selection and supporting discredited evolutionary theories.J. Futuyma, Douglas.

Since then, the U.S. has been involved in balancing conflicts amongst these culturally interconnected nations in order to further its interests in the region.

The park was created in 1997 to protect the biological diversity of the upper Parana River area. History The Ilha Grande National Park was created by decree without number issued by the Presidency of the Republic on 30 September 1997. Currently the park administration rests with the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). Characterization area The park, with its in area, encompasses all islands and islets from the Itaipu reservoir and river mouth Piquiri to the mouth of rivers and Amambai Iva√≠ on the Parana River, among which are the major islands Grande, Peruzzi, Peacock and Bandeirantes. The park area also includes wetlands and flood plains, situated on the banks of the Parana river, lake and lagoon waters and its surroundings and the Seawall Macaws. The river water intended for navigation are not part of the National Park of Ilha Grande. Ilha Grande National Park is adjacent to 9 municipalities: Gua√≠ra, Alt√¥nia, S√£o Jorge do Patroc√≠nio, Alto Para√≠so and Icara√≠ma in the state of Paran√°; and Mundo Novo, Eldorado, Itaquirai, and Navira√≠ in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Ilha Grande protects archaeological sites of great importance. It is known that the site was once inhabited by Guarani Indians and Xet√°s. Tourism and attractions The park is open free to the public for tours every day of the week. The park, in many places, has little beaches, leisure place where you can swim to the banks of the Paran√° River. Another option is the boat ride on the Parana River, passing through various localities of Ilha Grande. Wildlife and vegetation Ilha Grande is in a transition between cerrado (characteristic of the Pantanal) and seasonal Forest. Already fauna has several endemic species and/or endangered. Among the terrestrial fauna species were recorded as the marsh deer (Blastocelus dichotomus), the alligator-the-crop-yellow (Caiman Latorostris), the jaguar (Panthera onca), tapir (Tapirus terestris) and the giant anteater flag (Myrmecophata trydoctyla). Aquatic fauna include: painted (Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) ja√∫ (Paulicea luetkeni), armed (Pterodoras granular), gold (Salminus maxillosus), pacu (piractus mesopotamicus) and avifauna is cited: jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), ja√≥ (Cryptrellus undulatus), curassow (Crax fasciolata), American spoonbill (Platalea ajaja) and Jacana (Jacana jacana). Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paran√° River basin. They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Aguape√≠ State Park, Mico Le√£o Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiu√° Ecological Station and Igua√ßu National Park. The Santa Maria Ecological Corridor connects the Igua√ßu National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu, and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park. The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paran√° ecoregion.

A macrohaplogroup, its descendant lineages are distributed across many continents. Like its sibling macrohaplogroup M, macrohaplogroup N is a descendant of the haplogroup L3. All mtDNA haplogroups found outside of Africa are descendants of either haplogroup N or its sibling haplogroup M. M and N are the signature maternal haplogroups that define the theory of the recent African origin of modern humans and subsequent early human migrations around the world. The global distribution of haplogroups N and M indicates that there was likely at least one major prehistoric migration of humans out of Africa, with both N and M later evolving outside the continent. Origins Suggested routes of the initial settlement of Europe based on mtDNA haplogroups M and N, Metspalu et al. 2004. A major population split near the Persian Gulf would explain the ubiquity of Haplogroup N and the absence of Haplogroup M in West Eurasia There is widespread agreement in the scientific community concerning the African ancestry of haplogroup L3 (haplogroup N's parent clade). However, whether or not the mutations which define haplogroup N itself first occurred within Asia or Africa has been a subject for ongoing discussion and study. > The out of Africa hypothesis has gained generalized consensus. However, many > specific questions remain unsettled. To know whether the two M and N > macrohaplogroups that colonized Eurasia were already present in Africa > before the exit is puzzling. Torroni et al. 2006 state that Haplogroups M, N and R occurred somewhere between East Africa and the Persian Gulf. Also related to the origins of haplogroup N is whether ancestral haplogroups M, N and R were part of the same migration out of Africa, or whether Haplogroup N left Africa via the Northern route through the Levant, and M left Africa via Horn of Africa. This theory was suggested because haplogroup N is by far the predominant haplogroup in Western Eurasia, and haplogroup M is absent in Western Eurasia, but is predominant in India and is common in regions East of India. However, the mitochondrial DNA variation in isolated \\"relict\\" populations in southeast Asia and among Indigenous Australians supports the view that there was only a single dispersal from Africa. Southeast Asian populations and Indigenous Australians all possess deep rooted clades of both haplogroups M and N. The distribution of the earliest branches within haplogroups M, N, and R across Eurasia and Oceania therefore supports a three-founder-mtDNA scenario and a single migration route out of Africa. These findings also highlight the importance of Indian subcontinent in the early genetic history of human settlement and expansion. Asian origin hypothesis The hypothesis of Asia as the place of origin of haplogroup N is supported by the following: # Haplogroup N is found in all parts of the world but has low frequencies in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to a number of studies, the presence of Haplogroup N in Africa is most likely the result of back migration from Eurasia. # The oldest clades of macrohaplogroup N are found in Asia and Australia. # It would be paradoxical that haplogroup N had traveled all the distance to Australia or New World yet failed to affect other populations within Africa besides North Africans and Horn Africans. # The mitochondrial DNA variation in isolated \\"relict\\" populations in southeast Asia supports the view that there was only a single dispersal from Africa. The distribution of the earliest branches within haplogroups M, N, and R across Eurasia and Oceania provides additional evidence for a three-founder-mtDNA scenario and a single migration route out of Africa. These findings also highlight the importance of Indian subcontinent in the early genetic history of human settlement and expansion. Therefore, N's history is similar to M and R which have their most probable origin in South Asia. A study (Vai et al. 2019), finds a basal branch of maternal haplogroup N in early Neolithic North African remains from the Libyan site of Takarkori. The authors propose that N most likely split from L3 in the Arabian peninsula and later migrated back to North Africa, with its sister haplogroup M also likely splitting from L3 in the Middle East, but also suggest that N may have possibly diverged in North Africa, and state that more information is necessary to be certain. African origin hypothesis According to Toomas Kivisild \\"the lack of L3 lineages other than M and N in India and among non-African mitochondria in general suggests that the earliest migration(s) of modern humans already carried these two mtDNA ancestors, via a departure route over the Horn of Africa. In 2019, a study by Vai et al. presented evidence of a basal branch of haplogroup N from the Neolithic Sahara. They suggest that N either diverged from haplogroup L3 in the Near East (possibly in the Arabian peninsula, following the exit of L3 from Africa), then back-migrated to North Africa, or that it instead may have originated in North Africa (having diverged from L3 there). Distribution Haplogroup N is derived from the ancestral L3 macrohaplogroup, which represents the migration discussed in the theory of the recent African origin of modern humans. Haplogroup N is the ancestral haplogroup to almost all clades today distributed in Europe and Oceania, as well as many found in Asia and the Americas. It is believed to have arisen at a similar time to haplogroup M. Haplogroup N subclades like haplogroup U6 are also found at high to low frequencies in northwest and northeast Africa due to a back migration from Europe or Asia during the Paleolithic ca. 46,000 ybp, the estimated age of the basal U6* clade. Other haplogroups common in Western Eurasia, such as R0, J, and T, are also common in North Africa and parts of East Africa. The haplogroup N descendant lineage U6 has been found among Iberomaurusian specimens at the Taforalt site, which date from the Epipaleolithic. In Sub- Saharan Africa, several ancient samples of N have been found, the oldest so far being K1a dating back to about 2000 BC in Kenya. Additionally, haplogroup N predominated among ancient Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, which date from the Pre-Ptolemaic/late New Kingdom, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods. Subgroups distribution Haplogroup N's derived clades include the macro-haplogroup R and its descendants, and haplogroups A, I, S, W, X, and Y. Rare unclassified haplogroup N* has been found among fossils belonging to the Cardial and Epicardial culture (Cardium pottery) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. A rare unclassified form of N has been also been reported in modern Algeria. * Haplogroup N1'5 ** Haplogroup N1 ‚Äì found in West Eurasia. *** Haplogroup N1b ‚Äì found in Middle East, Egypt (Gurna), Caucasus and Europe. *** N1a'c'd'e'I **** Haplogroup N1c ‚Äì Northern Saudi Arabia, Turkey **** N1a'd'e'I ***** Haplogroup N1d ‚Äì India ***** N1a'e'I ****** Haplogroup N1a ‚Äì Arabian Peninsula and Northeast Africa.

After signing to major label DreamWorks Records, the band released In Reverie in late 2003. Shortly afterwards DreamWorks Records was absorbed by Interscope Records, resulting in the band being dropped from label. After completing some songs in early 2005, the band was aiming to record in May, hoping to release the album in the fall. Pre-production took place in early August with recording being done at the band's own studio, Electric Ladybug Studios with Steve Evetts as the producer. After recording wrapped up in October, the band immediately undertook a 47-date US tour. Sound the Alarm, along with the later records Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011) form a trilogy whose theme is self-discovery. In January 2006, the band re-signed with independent label Vagrant Records. After touring with Circa Survive and Moneen in spring 2006, Sound the Alarm was released in April. The album's release was preceded by the two songs--\\"The End\\" and \\"Shattered\\" --being made available for streaming. Sound the Alarm has received generally favorable reviews with a number of reviewers commenting on Conley's vocals. The album peaked at number 67 on the Billboard 200 chart and number four on the Independent Albums chart. Saves the Day performed as part of Warped Tour 2006. The band embarked on a brief east coast tour with I Am the Avalanche and Pistolita in September, followed by a co-headlining tour with Say Anything in spring 2007. Background In 2003, Saves the Day signed to major label DreamWorks Records and released In Reverie in September of that year.Sciarretto 2003, p. 5 Frontman Chris Conley received a call from the band's A&R; person at the label: \\"[H]e said, 'None of the programmers at radio are biting at the single, and MTV doesn't want to play the video, so we're going to have to start thinking about the next record.' I had a total breakdown. I was like, 'How is this possible? The album just came out!'\\" A few weeks after the album's release, DreamWorks Records was absorbed by Interscope Records and not long after, the band was dropped from the label. Using all the money they had, the group decided to build their own studio. Conley explained, \\"if we have a place to make cheap records, we can keep the band going for years\\". Before they began working on new material, Conley was having doubts about himself. \\"[I] completely lost faith in myself\\" after the lack of success with In Reverie, \\"when that happened, a chamber got opened up inside me, a vault of seething despair\\". Sometime after, Conley locked himself in a room, forcing himself to write new material. He explained that \\"all of a sudden, the shit storm came. And there was plenty of material -- just frustration and rage and desperation, just the fear of losing everything\\". Following the completion of new songs in February 2005, the group planned to start recording in May, with a projected fall release date for the new album. Prior to the recording sessions, bassist Eben D'Amico was replaced by Glassjaw bassist Manuel Carrero. Conley said he told D'Amico that he was being kicked out of the band, which was a collective decision, as D'Amico wasn't \\"on the same wavelength anymore\\" while in the writing stages for a new alum. Recording On August 4, 2005, the band began pre-production, and the following day were \\"in full swing, blazing through songs in rehearsal\\" in preparation for recording. By this point, the group had 18 songs, and aimed to record 14 of them. The band called this material \\"short and fast and angry,\\" citing several songs they were working on: \\"Head for the Hills,\\" \\"Sound the Alarm,\\" \\"Diseased\\" and \\"Eulogy\\". The recording sessions for Sound the Alarm were self-funded by the band, which Conley described as having \\"stretched us, for sure\\". He said the band considered themselves \\"lucky enough to have enough capital\\" to start recording, which took place at their personal studio, Electric Ladybug Studios. Producer duties were handled by Steve Evetts, who produced the group's first two albums, Can't Slow Down (1998) and Through Being Cool (1999). According to Conley, the band worked with Evetts again as he could \\"see what your qualities are and bring out the best in you\\". They attempted to get Rob Schnapf, who produced Stay What You Are (2001) and In Reverie, but were unable to due to scheduling issues. Evetts also engineered the recordings, with assistance from Jesse Cannon during drum tracking. On August 28, 2005, the band posted a recording update on their website. In the post, Conley mentioned the band had worked on a song titled \\"Sticky 500\\" the day before, and were proceeding to work on \\"Say You'll Never Leave\\". He revealed that he had done \\"some rough vocals\\" takes and noted that recording was \\"moving along pretty quickly now\\". The band announced they had finished recording on October 19. The album was mixing by Chad Blinman at The Eye Socket and mastered by Dave Collins at Dave Collins Mastering. Composition Sound the Alarm is the first album in a trilogy with the theme of self- discovery. It was followed by Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was \\"an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance.\\" All the album's songs were written by the band, with Conley providing lyrics. According to Conley, Sound the Alarm details the \\"furious truth of my aching heart, my tumultuous emotional landscape, and my fractured psyche. Knowing that I needed to turn myself around after nearly destroying myself and my relationships with my strained emotional existence\\". Describing the album's theme, Conley said it was \\"desolation, like you're the last person standing after the apocalypse and you're alone and you're cold. Your home has been obliterated, but you have to keep on trucking through those feelings of isolation and desolation and keep hope alive in the midst of insanity.\\" The album's sound has been described as emo, pop, pop punkGriffin 2006, p. D18 and power pop, being referred to a mature iteration one of their earlier albums, Through Being Cool (1999). It drew overall comparisons to Hawthorne Heights, Hey Mercedes, Matchbook Romance, Dead Boys and 7 Seconds, with the guitar work recalling the Stooges and the Pixies. On the album's sound, Conley revealed that the group purposefully \\"kept it simple,\\" relying solely on two guitars, bass and drums, attempting to create \\"a raw album\\" in the process. Conley's vocals were reminiscent of Our Lady Peace frontman Raine Maida with sneer in the vein of Sid Vicious. The lyrics make reference to cutting off limps, ripping out tongues and lungs, guns and hangings, among other things. Conley described the opening track \\"Head for the Hills\\" as being \\"thoughts that creep up and swallow you, and you can't ignore the negative, the hell inside\\". It set the template for the remainder of the album in its mood, tempo and thick bass sound, coming across as a combination of Bad Brains and the Stooges. \\"The End\\", along with \\"Say You'll Never Leave\\", channeled the band's earlier punk rock roots with its short length and fast pace. \\"Shattered\\" and \\"Delusional\\" were initially intended to appear on In Reverie; both were rewritten for inclusion on Sound the Alarm. The Pennywise-indebted \\"Dying Day\\" and \\"Delusional\\" evoked the likes of \\"Nightingale\\" and \\"Cars and Calories\\", both tracks from Stay What You Are. \\"34\\" is an emo track where the guitars add emphasis to every word during the chorus sections. Conley said \\"Don't Know Why [is] my blues. It's one of those songs that keeps me off the ledge personally. I sing it to myself all the time when I'm at home alone.\\" The closing track \\"Hell Is Here\\" opened with a 1970s-style hard rock guitar intro that recalled Wolfmother. Release Immediately after finishing recording, the band went on a 47-date tour, with Senses Fail, The Early November and Say Anything, lasting from October until December 2005. On January 8, 2006, the band formally announced Carrero was a member of the group, and on January 30, that they had re-signed with independent label Vagrant Records. The label had previously released the band's Stay What You Are (2001) and Ups & Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides (2004) albums. Label boss Rich Egan stated that the band \\"helped put Vagrant on the map\\" and that the label was \\"ecstatic to have them back\\". Conley said that as the label was almost half-controlled by Interscope, it would've been seen as \\"a kick in the ass\\" to them as they \\"have to work with us again\\". On February 13, the track listing and artwork for Sound the Alarm, which was designed by Soloway, was revealed. In March and April, the band toured the US with support from Circa Survive and Moneen. On March 23, \\"The End\\" and \\"Shattered\\" were made available for streaming. This was followed by a second leg of the tour with Circa Survive and Moneen, running into April and May. Sound the Alarm was initially planned for release on April 4, before being released on April 11 through Vagrant Records. A music video was released for \\"The End\\". The band appeared on Warped Tour 2006 performing two sets: one on the main stage and an acoustic set on the Vagrant stage. In September, the band went on a brief east coast tour with support from I Am the Avalanche and Pistolita. In November, Conley performed a few solo shows across the east coast. In March 2007, Parada left the group and was replaced by Classic Case/Glassjaw drummer Durijah Lang. In April and May, the band went a co-headlining tour with Say Anything. Reception Sound the Alarm reached number 67 on the Billboard 200 chart and number four on the Independent Albums chart. According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album received generally favourable reviews. The music of Sound the Alarm divided reviewers, with some praising it, while others were unimpressed. AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar viewed the album as a return to the \\"aggressive pop-punk nature\\" of Through Being Cool, \\"but ya know, five years more mature\\". Entertainment Weekly reviewer Leah Greenblatt considered the album is \\"as turgidly epic as the tenets of the genre demand\\" with the band having seemingly \\"rediscovered their riff-heavy melodics\\" to sit alongside \\"impressively righteous indignation\\". Gigwise staff member David Renshaw regarded the instrumentation as being \\"nothing spectacular,\\" while noting that there were \\"riffs piled on top of riffs ... and a few funky basslines\\". IGN reviewer Chad Grischow maintained that the music \\"comes across [as] toothless\\", lacking \\"any originality,\\" and was \\"too repetitive and predictable\\". Evan Davies of Now observed that the album sounded like the group were \\"going through an identity crisis\\". In a review for the Iowa State Daily, Tyler Barrett held a similar viewpoint, commenting that the band sounding as if they were \\"clearly caught in a web of aspirations, all at once attempting to evolve musically while sticking to its roots\\". PopMatters reviewer Dan Raper asserted that the songs, \\"for all their bluster, hardly make any impression at all. ... Saves the Day have given their fans nothing exciting, innovative, or new.\\" Reaction to Conley's voice was mixed with some reviewers commenting on its whininess; his lyrics received equally mixed responses. Apar noted Conley's vocals as walking \\"that fine line between endearing and annoying\\" and likened them to Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace crossed with Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols. Davies said Conley \\"has toned down his once enraging nasal whine and sounds unusually aggressive\\". Grischow, however, stated that Conley \\"whines his way through the entire album, sounding as though he is on his knees begging for something\\". In a review for Alternative Press, Scott Heisel reckoned Conley \\"seem[ed] to take pride in wearing his heart not just on his lyrical sleeve, but on any organ you‚Äôd care to eviscerate\\". John J. Moser of The Morning Call considered the lyrics were \\"as dark and violent\\" as possible, and suggested they would \\"repuls[e] listeners instead of having them relate.\\" Renshaw, on the other hand, said \\"the thing that keeps you coming back to this album is the lyrics\\".

The highway runs from Crystal Beach east to the Delaware state line in Warwick, where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 299 (DE 299). MD 282 is the primary east-west highway of the Sassafras Neck between the Sassafras River and Bohemia River, connecting Crystal Beach, Earleville, and Warwick with MD 213 in Cecilton in southern Cecil County. The state highway was paved in Warwick by 1910 and constructed from Warwick to Cecilton in the late 1910s. West of Cecilton, what is today MD 282 consists of part of former MD 283, which ran from Crystal Beach to Earleville. MD 282 was constructed to Earleville in the early 1920s and extended a short distance west of Earleville in the late 1920s. MD 283 was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 282 was extended west to Crystal Beach along MD 283 in 1959. The highway from Cecilton to Crystal Beach was reconstructed in the late 1960s. Route description View west along MD 282 at MD 213 in Cecilton MD 282 begins at the intersection of Crystal Beach Road and White Crystal Beach Road in Crystal Beach near the Elk River. The state highway starts heading north but curves southeast as two-lane undivided Crystal Beach Road along Pearce Neck. MD 282 curves south and passes St. Stephen's Episcopal Church while being paralleled by Old Crystal Beach Road. In Earleville, MD 282 makes a sweeping curve to the east, passing the intersection of Grove Neck Road, which leads to the historic estates Rose Hill and Mount Harmon. The state highway continues east to the town of Cecilton, within which the highway follows Main Street and intersects MD 213 (Bohemia Avenue). MD 282 leaves Cecilton along Cecilton Warwick Road. The Cecilton area is home to a small Amish settlement. After the intersection with Sassafras Road, MD 282 heads northeast through the village of Warwick and intersects Church Road, which leads to St. Francis Xavier Church. At the east end of Warwick, the highway reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line. The highway continues east as DE 299 (Warwick Road) toward Middletown. History The first section of MD 282 to be paved was Main Street in Warwick, which was paved as a macadam road by 1910. The remainder of the highway from Cecilton to Warwick was paved as a macadam road by 1919. The highway from Cecilton to the east end of Earleville was paved as a concrete road in 1922 and 1923. MD 282 was paved west from Earleville along Grove Neck Road west to Mount Harmon Road in 1929. The current course of MD 282 west of Earleville was originally part of MD 283. The first section of MD 283 was paved from the split from MD 282 near Earleville north to Glebe Road in 1928. MD 283 was extended west to Crystal Beach as a concrete road in two segments. The first segment was started in 1930 and completed by 1933, and the second segment was completed in 1934. In 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission proposed MD 282 between Cecilton and the Delaware state line be widened to . In 1945, Cecil County proposed MD 283 be extended west to the Elk River and MD 282 be extended west toward the Sassafras River in the third year of a three- year post-World War II road construction program. The first proposal became reality when MD 282 was reconstructed and resurfaced from Cecilton to the state line in 1949 and 1950. The second proposal was never enacted; in fact, the Grove Neck Road portion of MD 282 was transferred to county maintenance in a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. MD 282 instead was extended west over MD 283 to Crystal Beach. MD 282 was reconstructed from Cecilton to Earleville in 1966 and 1967. The highway was relocated at its sweeping curve in Earleville, eliminating a right-angle intersection at Peddlers Lane and a four-way intersection with Sandy Bottom Road and Grove Neck Road. The L-shaped bypassed highway at Peddlers Lane became MD 912, and the bypassed segments at Sandy Bottom Road became MD 282 auxiliary routes. MD 282 was reconstructed from Earleville to Crystal Beach in 1967 and 1968. The highway was relocated on either side of Glebe Road; Old Crystal Beach Road became MD 912A. MD 282 was widened from MD 213 to the Delaware state line in 1993 and from MD 213 to the west town limit of Cecilton in 1998.

She appeared in the film Picnic at Hanging Rock, but her best-known roles were in TV soap operas, including: Ida Jessup in The Sullivans, Edna Pearson in Prisoner and Nell Mangel in Neighbours. She retired in 1988, moving back to her native England to Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, where she lived a quiet and private life. Early life Gray was born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England on 20 July 1924. Gray was the daughter of Allan Gray and Doris Gray, who had been married the previous year in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. She was the eldest of four children. The family later moved to Surrey where her father became a fish merchant at the Grimsby Docks. She initially worked as a local reporter, photographer's assistant and as a sales assistant in a department store, and later became a nurse, and served with the Women's Land Army. In 1952 she emigrated to Australia to pursue a career as an actress. Career In the 1970s, Gray appeared in a number of television dramas produced by Crawford Productions including Solo One, Bluey, Homicide, Division 4, Matlock Police, and Carson's Law. She also appeared in film portraying mathematics teacher Miss Greta McCraw in Peter Weir's adaptation of Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and in the television mini-series Anzacs and All the Rivers Run. She worked with Weir again in 1977 in his film The Last Wave, playing the role of Aboriginal history expert Dr. Whitburn. The Sullivans Gray played Ida Jessup in the soap opera The Sullivans for its 16-season run from 1976 to 1983, winning two Logie Awards for her portrayal of the gossipy neighbour. Prisoner She appeared in serial Prisoner (known internationally as Prisoner: Cell Block H), as genteel poisoner Edna Pearson in 1984. After the initial showing of her episodes in Australia, a woman named Emily Perry claimed the story was based on her real life experience of being accused of poisoning her husband and threatened to sue the producers, Grundy Television. As a result, any material that coincided with the woman's story was removed for subsequent episode screenings, including the full Australian DVD release of Prisoner. In 2010 a special DVD release of the full uncut \\"Edna\\" story was released, but only in the United Kingdom. Neighbours In 1986, Gray was cast in the role of \\"Nell\\" Mangel, better known as Mrs Mangel for three weeks in the soap opera Neighbours. However, the character proved so popular that she remained on the show until 1988, appearing in 292 episodes. The character was known for her constant feuding with Madge Bishop, played by Anne Charleston, and vying for the affections of Harold Bishop, played by Ian Smith. Gray left the role after receiving abuse from fans who disliked the character, with producers relocating Mangel to St. Albans, with a retired dentist, to live a happy retirement. This was Gray's last acting role and she herself retired returning to her native land and settling in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex. Later life and recognition Gray won two Logie Awards for her role as Ida Jessup in The Sullivans: in 1978 for Best Sustained Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, and in 1981 for Best Support Actress in a Series. In 1995, Gray was featured on an Australian postage stamp, depicting her role in Picnic at Hanging Rock. Gray died on 29 July 2016, nine days after her 92nd birthday.

The route was lined with flags of the ROC and Kiribati during a state visit by President Anote Tong. A view of Ketagalan Boulevard from the Gongyuan Road intersection towards the Presidential Office Building. Ketagalan Boulevard () is an arterial road in Zhongzheng District in Taipei, Taiwan, between the Presidential Office Building and the East Gate (Êù±ÈñÄ). It is long and has a total of ten lanes in each direction with no median. History The former name of this street is Chieh-shou Road (‰ªãÂ£ΩË∑Ø); Chieh-shou (‰ªãÂ£Ω) means \\"Long live Chiang Kai-shek\\". On May 19, 1989 a pro- democracy activist named Chan I-hua performed self-immolation to protest the blocking of funeral procession of fellow activist Cheng Nan-jung. On 21 March 1996, when Chen Shui-bian was the mayor of Taipei, Chieh-shou Road was renamed Ketagalan Boulevard and the surrounding square was renamed Ketagalan Square in honor of the Ketagalan Taiwanese aborigines originally living in the Taipei area. However, Ketagalan Boulevard has been given other levels of political meaning and has even become the protesting holy land of opposing political parties. Back when there was a stern atmosphere in front of the Presidential Office Building, pedestrians had to pass by with their heads lowered. Motorcycles and bicycles were banned from Chieh-shou Road and a section of Chungking South Road right in front of the Presidential Office Building. When Chieh-shou Road was renamed Ketagalan Boulevard, the traffic signs banning motorcycles and bicycles on Ketagalan Boulevard and Chongqing South Road were removed,Newsletter of President A-Bian , 21 February 2002, in Chinese reminiscent of \\"lifting martial law\\" (Ëß£Âö¥). When renaming the road, it was announced that there was no disrespect intended to former President Chiang Kai-shek. Ketagalan Boulevard and the area surrounding the Presidential Office Building and East Gate is a popular location for mass political rallies. For example, after the 2004 presidential election, supporters of the Pan-Blue Coalition not satisfied with the result of the election occupied Ketagalan Boulevard, protesting and parading for an entire week. In the wake of the renaming of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall () by the DPP administration, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin proposed to rename the section of Ketagalan Boulevard between the Presidential Office Building and Kungyuan Road \\"Anticorruption Democracy Square\\" (ÂèçË≤™ËÖêÊ∞ë‰∏ªÂª£Â†¥) after the 2006 protests. However, subsequent debate regarding this name change has not occurred since the renaming of the memorial hall. In February 2017, the Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard protest, surrounding the delineation of traditional lands, started on the Boulevard. Landmarks Ketagalan Boulevard is 400 meters long. Along the road are three buildings, two parks and two parking lots.

The Allied Powers authorized the occupation and creation of the Zone of Smyrna () during negotiations regarding the partition of the Ottoman Empire to protect the ethnic Greek population living in and around the city. The Greek landing on 15 May 1919 was celebrated by the substantial local Greek population but quickly resulted in ethnic violence in the area. This violence decreased international support for the occupation and led to a rise of Turkish nationalism. The High Commissioner of Smyrna, Aristeidis Stergiadis, took a firm stance against discrimination against the Turkish population by the administration; however, ethnic tensions and discrimination remained. Stergiadis also began work on projects involving resettlement of Greek refugees, the foundations for a University, and some public health projects. Smyrna was a major base of operations for Greek troops in Anatolia during the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922). The Greek occupation of Smyrna ended on 9 September 1922 with the Turkish capture of Smyrna by troops commanded by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. After the Turkish advance on Smyrna, a mob murdered the Orthodox bishop Chrysostomos of Smyrna and a few days later the Great Fire of Smyrna burnt large parts of the city (including most of the Greek and Armenian areas). Estimated Greek and Armenian deaths range from 10,000Naimark. Fires of Hatred, pp. 47‚Äì52.Naimark, Norman M. Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe.

With the end of the occupation of Smyrna, major combat in Anatolia between Greek and Turkish forces largely ended, and on 24 July 1923, the parties signed the Treaty of Lausanne ending the war.  Background  Allied troops marching during the Occupation of Constantinople Partition of the Ottoman Empire according to the Treaty of S√®vres At the end of World War I (1914‚Äì1918), attention of the Allied Powers (Entente Powers) focused on the partition of the territory of the Ottoman Empire. As part of the Treaty of London (1915), by which Italy left the Triple Alliance (with Germany and Austria-Hungary) and joined France, Great Britain and Russia in the Triple Entente, Italy was promised the Dodecanese and, if the partition of the Ottoman Empire were to occur, land in Anatolia including Antalya and surrounding provinces presumably including Smyrna. But in later 1915, as an inducement to enter the war, British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey in private discussion with Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek Prime Minister at the time, promised large parts of the Anatolian coast to Greece, including Smyrna. Venizelos resigned from his position shortly after this communication, but when he had formally returned to power in June 1917, Greece entered the war on the side of the Entente. On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Entente powers and the Ottoman Empire ending the Ottoman front of World War I. Great Britain, Greece, Italy, France, and the United States began discussing what the treaty provisions regarding the partition of Ottoman territory would be, negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of S√®vres. These negotiations began in February 1919 and each country had distinct negotiating preferences about Smyrna. The French, who had large investments in the region, took a position for territorial integrity of a Turkish state that would include the zone of Smyrna. The British were at a loggerhead over the issue with the War Office and India Office promoting the territorial integrity idea and Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the Foreign Office, headed by Lord Curzon, opposed this suggestion and wanting Smyrna to be under separate administration. The Italian position was that Smyrna was rightfully their possession and so the diplomats would refuse to make any comments when Greek control over the area was discussed. The Greek government, pursuing Venizelos' support for the Megali Idea (to bring areas with a majority Greek population or with historical or religious ties to Greece under control of the Greek state) and supported by Lloyd George, began a large propaganda effort to promote their claim to Smyrna including establishing a mission under the foreign minister in the city. Moreover, the Greek claim over the Smyrna area (which appeared to have a clear Greek majority, although exact percentages varied depending on the source) were supported by Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points which emphasized the right to autonomous development for minorities in Anatolia. In negotiations, despite French and Italian objections, by the middle of February 1919 Lloyd George shifted the discussion to how Greek administration would work and not whether Greek administration would happen. To further this aim, he brought in a set of experts, including Arnold J. Toynbee, to discuss how the zone of Smyrna would operate and what its impacts would be on the population. Following this discussion, in late February 1919, Venezilos appointed Aristeidis Stergiadis, a close political ally, the High Commissioner of Smyrna (appointed over political riser Themistoklis Sofoulis). In April 1919, the Italians landed and took over Antalya and began showing signs of moving troops towards Smyrna. During the negotiations at about the same time, the Italian delegation walked out when it became clear that Fiume (Rijeka) would not be given to them in the peace outcome. Lloyd George saw an opportunity to break the impasse over Smyrna with the absence of the Italian delegation and, according to Jensen, he \\"concocted a report that an armed uprising of Turkish guerrillas in the Smyrna area was seriously endangering the Greek and other Christian minorities.\\" Both to protect local Christians and also to limit increasing Italian action in Anatolia, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported a Greek military occupation of Smyrna. Although Smyrna would be occupied by Greek troops, authorized by the Allies, the Allies did not agree that Greece would take sovereignty over the territory until further negotiations settled this issue. The Italian delegation acquiesced to this outcome and the Greek occupation was authorized.  Greek landing at Smyrna  Greek troops marching on ƒ∞zmir's coastal street, May 1919. Greek soldiers taking their posts, May 1919. On 14 May 1919, the Greek mission in Smyrna read a statement announcing that Greek troops would be arriving the next day in the city. Smith reports that this news was \\"received with great emotion\\" by the Greek population of the city while thousands of Turkish residents gathered in the hill that night lighting fires and beating drums in protest. The same night, thousands of Turkish prisoners were released from a prison with the complicity of the Ottoman and Italian commanders in charge of the prison. Greek occupation of Smyrna started on 15 May 1919 where a large crowd gathered waving the Greek kingdom flags on the docks where the Greek troops were expected to arrive. The Metropolitan of Smyrna, Chrysostomos, blessed the first troops as they arrived. An inexperienced colonel was in charge of the operation and neither the appointed high commissioner nor high-ranking military individuals were there for the landing, resulting in miscommunication and a breakdown of discipline. Most significantly, this resulted in the 1/38 Evzone Regiment landing north of where they were to take up their post. They had to march south, passing a large part of the Greek celebratory crowds, the Ottoman governor's konak and the barracks of Ottoman troops. Someone fired a shot (Smith indicates that no one knows who) and chaos resulted, with the Greek troops firing multiple shots into the konak and the barracks. The Ottoman troops surrendered and the Greek regiment began marching them up the coast to a ship to serve as a temporary prison. A British subject at the scene claimed he witnessed the shooting deaths of thirty unarmed prisoners during this march, by both Greeks in the crowd and Greek troops. British officers in the harbor reported seeing Greek troops bayoneting multiple Turkish prisoners during the march and then saw them thrown into the sea. In the chaos, looting of Turkish houses began, and by the end of the day three to four hundred Turks had been killed. One hundred Greeks were also killed, including two soldiers. Violence continued the next day and for the next months as Greek troops took over towns and villages in the region and atrocities were committed by both ethnic groups, notably the Battle of Aydƒ±n on 27 June 1919. Reactions to the landing demonstrate in Istanbul for national unity. The landing and reports of the violence had a large impact on many parties. The landing helped bring together the various groups of Turkish resistance into an organized movement (further assisted by the landing of Mustafa Kemal in Samsun on 19 May 1919). Several demonstrations were held by Turkish people in Constantinople condemning the occupation of Smyrna. Between 100,000 and 150,000 people gathered in a meeting at Sultanahmet square organized by the Karakol society and T√ºrk Ocaƒüƒ±. In Great Britain and France, the reports of violence increased opposition in the governments to a permanent Greek control over the area. As a response to the claims of violence, the French Prime Minister Clemenceau suggested an Interallied Commission of Inquiry to Smyrna: the commission was made up of Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol for the United States, General Bunoust for France, General Hare for England, General Dall'olio for Italy and, as a non-voting observer, Colonel Mazarakis for Greece. It began work in August 1919 and interviewed 175 witnesses and visited multiple sites of alleged atrocities. The decision reached was that when a Greek witness and Turkish witness disagreed, a European witness would be used to provide the conclusions for the report. This system was dismissed by Venizelos because he claimed that the Europeans living in Smyrna benefited from privileges given to them under the Ottoman rule and were thus opposed to Greek rule. The report was released to negotiators in October and generally found Greeks responsible for the bloodshed related to the landing and the violence throughout the Smyrna zone after the landing. In addition, the conclusions questioned the fundamental justification for the Greek occupation and suggested Greek troops be replaced by an allied force. Eyre Crowe, a main British diplomat, dismissed the larger conclusion by saying the Commission had overstepped its mandate. In the negotiations after the report, Clemenceau reminded Venizelos that the occupation of Smyrna was not permanent and merely a political solution. Venizelos responded angrily and the negotiators moved on. At about the same time, British Field Marshal George Milne was tasked by the allies with devising a solution to Italian and Greek tension in the Menderes River Valley. Milne warned in his report that Turkish guerrilla action would continue as long as the Greeks continued to occupy Smyrna and questioned the justification for Greek occupation. Most importantly, his report developed a border that would separate the Smyrna zone from the rest of Anatolia. The council of Great Britain, France, U.S. and Italy approved the Milne line beyond which Greek troops were not to cross, except to pursue attackers but not more than 3 km beyond the line.  Administration of the Smyrna Zone (1919‚Äì1922)  The Greek leadership in October 1920: High Commissioner Aristeidis Stergiadis, Lt. Gen. Leonidas Paraskevopoulos and his chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Theodoros Pangalos High Commissioner Aristeidis Stergiadis was appointed the High Commissioner of Smyrna in February and arrived in the city four days after the 15 May landing. Stergiadis immediately went to work in setting up an administration, easing ethnic violence, and making way for permanent annexation of Smyrna. Stergiadis immediately punished the Greek soldiers responsible for violence on 15‚Äì16 May with court martial and created a commission to decide on payment for victims (made up of representatives from Great Britain, France, Italy and other allies). Stergiadis took a strict stance against discrimination of the Turkish population and opposed church leaders and the local Greek population on a number of occasions. Historians disagree about whether this was a genuine stance against discriminationClogg, Richard. A concise History of Greece, page 93 . Cambridge University Press, 20 June 2002 ‚Äì 308 pages. or whether it was an attempt to present a positive vision of the occupation to the allies. This stance against discrimination of the Turkish population often pitted Stergiadis against the local Greek population, the church and the army. He reportedly would carry a stick through the town with which he would beat Greeks that were being abusive of Turkish citizens. At one point, Stergiadis interrupted and ended a sermon by the bishop Chrysostomos that he believed to be incendiary. Troops would disobey his orders to not abuse the Turkish population often putting him in conflict with the military. On 14 July 1919, the acting foreign secretary sent a long critical telegraph to Venizelos suggesting that Stergiadis be removed and writing that \\"His sick neuroticism has reached a climax.\\" Venizelos continued to support Stergiadis despite this opposition, while the latter oversaw a number of projects planning for a permanent Greek administration of Smyrna. Evzones in front of the headquarters of the High Commissioner. Structure of the administration The Greek consulate building became the center of government. Since Ottoman sovereignty was not replaced with the occupation, their administrative structure continued to exist but Stergiadis simply replaced senior positions with Greeks (except for the post for Muslim Affairs) while Turkish functionaries remained in low positions. Urgent steps were required for the organization of a local administration as soon as the Greek army secured control of the region.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 132 A significant obstacle during the first period of the Greek administration was the absence of a clear definition of the Greek mandate. In this context the coexistence of interallied authorities whose functions often overlapped with that of the Greek authorities resulted in a series of misunderstandings and friction between the two sides. This situation resulted after a decision by the Supreme Allied Council that all movements of the Greek army had to be approved by Field Marshal George Milne.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 138 The administration of the Smyrna zone was organized in units largely based on the former Ottoman system. Apart from the kaza of Smyrna and the adjacent area of Ayasoluk which were under the direct control of the Smyrna High Commission, the remaining zone was divided into one province ( Nomarchia): that of Manisa, as well as the following counties ( Ypodioikiseis): √ñdemi≈ü, Tire (Thira), Bayƒ±ndƒ±r (Vaindirion), Nympheon, Krini, Karaburna, Sivrihisar, Vryula, Palea Phocaea, Menemen, Kasaba, Bergama and Ayvali.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 154 Repatriation of refugees The repatriation of the Asia Minor Greeks who had sought refuge in the Greek Kingdom as a result of the deportations and persecutions by the Ottoman authorities, assumed top priority, already from May 1919. The Greek authorities wanted to avoid a situation where refugees would return without the necessary supervision and planning. For this purpose, a special department was created within the High Commission.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 162 A survey conducted by the refugees department indicated that more than 150 towns and villages along the coastal area (from Edremit to S√∂ke) had been destroyed during World War I. Especially from the 45,000 households belonging to local Greeks, 18,000 were partially damaged, while 23,000 completely destroyed.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 165 In general the period of the Greek administration experienced a continuous movement of refugee populations aided by charitable institutions such as the Red Cross and the Greek ‚ÄúPatriotic Institution‚Äù ().Solomonidis, 1984, p. 171 In total, 100,000 Greeks who had lost their land during World War I, many a result of Ottoman discrimination, were resettled under Stergiadis, given generous credit, and access to farm tools. George, 1921 Muslim affairs Following the Treaty of S√®vres, all sections of the Ottoman administration that dealt with issues pertaining to Muslim religion, education and family affairs were organized by the High Commission.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 179 Under this context a special polytechnic school was established in Smyrna which soon operated with 210 Muslim students and with costs covered by the Greek administration.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 180 However, nationalist sentiments and suspicion continued to limit the impacts of Stergiadis' administration. The resettlement of Greeks and harsh treatment by the army and local Greek population led many Turkish residents to leave which created a refugee problem. Discrimination by junior Greek administrators and military members further contributed to Turkish hostility in the Smyrna zone. The Ionian University of Smyrna, was established in December 1920 and organized by Constantin Carath√©odory Archaeological excavations Archaeological missions in Asia Minor were of significant importance for the High Commission. Excavations were focused on ancient Greek settlements in the area, mainly found in the surroundings of the urban areas, as well as along the coastal zone.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 182 The most important excavation were conducted during 1921‚Äì1922, where important findings were unearthed in the Ionian sites of Klazomenai, Ephesus and Nysa. Apart from ancient Greek antiquities, Byzantine monuments were also unearthed, such as the 6th century Basilica of St. John the Theologian in Ephesus. In general, the excavations undertaken by the Greek administration provided interesting material concerning the history of Ancient Greek and Byzantine Art. University Another important project undertaken during the Greek administration was the institution and organization of the Ionian University of Smyrna. Originally conceived by the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and entrusted to Professor German-Greek mathematician Constantin Carath√©odory of G√∂ttingen University, as head of the new university.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 184 In the summer of 1922, its facilities were completed at a cost of 110,000 Turkish liras. The latter included 70 lecture rooms, a large amphitheatre, a number of laboratories and separate smaller structures for the University personnel.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 186 Its various schools and departments of the University were to start operating gradually.Solomonidis, 1984, p. 188 Moreover, a microbiology laboratory, the local Pasteur institute and the department of health became the first fields of instruction at the new university.  Developments in the Greco-Turkish War Smyrna clock tower, summer 1920. In 1920, the Smyrna zone became a key base for the Greek summer offensive in the Greco-Turkish War. Early in July 1920, the allies approved operations by the Greeks to take over Eastern Thrace and territory around Smyrna as part of ongoing hostilities with the Turkish Nationalist movement. On 22 July 1920, Greek military divisions crossed the Milne line around the Smyrna zone and began military operations in the rest of Anatolia. Greek soldiers retreating, 1922 International negotiations between the allies and the Ottoman administration largely ignored the increasing conflict. In early 1920, Lloyd George was able to convince the new French Prime Minister, Alexandre Millerand to accept Greek control of Smyrna, but under Turkish suzerainty. Negotiations were further refined in April 1920 at a meeting of the parties in Sanremo which was designed to discuss mostly issues of Germany, but because of increasing power of the nationalist forces under Kemal, the discussion shifted to focus on Smyrna. French pressure and divisions within the British government resulted in Lloyd George accepting a time frame of 5 years for Greek control over Smyrna with the issue to be decided by the League of Nations at that point. These decisions, i.e. regarding a Greek administration but with limited Turkish sovereignty and a 5-year limit, were included in the text of the Treaty of S√®vres agreed to on 10 August 1920. Because the treaty largely ignored the rise of nationalist forces and the ethnic tension in the Smyrna zone, Montgomery has described the Treaty of S√®vres as \\"stillborn\\". However, with the signing of the Treaty of S√®vres, the Ottoman Vali Izzet Bey handed over authority over Smyrna to Stergiadis. In October 1920, Venizelos lost his position as Prime Minister of Greece. French and Italians used this opportunity to remove their support and financial obligations to the Smyrna occupation and this left the British as the only force supporting the Greek occupation. Smyrna remained a key base of operations for the ongoing war through the rest of 1920 and 1921, particularly under General Georgios Hatzianestis. A significant loss at the Battle of Sakarya in September 1921 resulted in a retreat of Greek forces to the 1920 lines. The ensuing retreat resulted in massive civilian casualties and atrocities committed by Greek and Turkish troops. Jensen summarizes the violence writing that \\"The Turkish population was subjected to horrible atrocities by the retreating troops and accompanying civilian Christian mobs. The pursuing Turkish cavalry did not hesitate in kind on the Christian populace; the road from U≈üak to Smyrna lay littered with corpses.\\"  Aftermath  Photo of the Great fire of Smyrna (1922) Greek troops evacuated Smyrna on 9 September 1922 and a small allied force of British entered the city to prevent looting and violence. The next day, Mustafa Kemal, leading a number of troops, entered the city and was greeted by enthusiastic Turkish crowds. Atrocities by Turkish troops and irregulars against the Greek and Armenian population occurred immediately after the takeover. Most notably, Chrysostomos, the Orthodox Bishop, was lynched by a mob of Turkish citizens. A few days afterward, a fire destroyed the Greek and Armenian quarters of the city, while the Turkish and Jewish quarters remained undamaged. Culpability for the fire is blamed on all ethnic groups and clear blame remains elusive. On the Turkish side - but not among Greeks - the events are known as the \\"Liberation of ƒ∞zmir\\". The evacuation of Smyrna by Greek troops ended most of the large scale fighting in the Greco-Turkish war which was formally ended with an Armistice and a final treaty on 24 July 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne. Much of the Greek population was included in the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey resulting in migration to Greece and elsewhere.

This pictured amount is roughly 150mg, and is thus around 150 standard doses. Etizex brand etizolam tablets Etizolam (marketed under many brand names) is a thienodiazepine derivative which is a benzodiazepine analog. The etizolam molecule differs from a benzodiazepine in that the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring and triazole ring has been fused, making the drug a thienotriazolodiazepine. It possesses amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It was patented in 1972 and approved for medical use in 1983. Medical uses * Short-term treatment of insomnia. Side effects Long term use may result in blepharospasms. Doses of 4 mg or more may cause anterograde amnesia. In rare cases, erythema annulare centrifugum skin lesions have resulted. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal Abrupt or rapid discontinuation from etizolam, as with benzodiazepines, may result in the appearance of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, including rebound insomnia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare event in benzodiazepine withdrawal, has been documented in a case of abrupt withdrawal from etizolam. This is particularly relevant given etizolam's short half life relative to benzodiazepines such as diazepam resulting in a more rapid drug level decrease in blood plasma levels. In a study that compared the effectiveness of etizolam, alprazolam, and bromazepam for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, all three drugs retained their effectiveness over 2 weeks, but etizolam became more effective from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Administering .5 mg etizolam twice daily did not induce cognitive deficits over 3 weeks when compared to placebo. When multiple doses of etizolam, or lorazepam, were administered to rat neurons, lorazepam caused downregulation of alpha-1 benzodiazepine binding sites (tolerance/dependence), while etizolam caused an increase in alpha-2 benzodiazepine binding sites (reverse tolerance to anti- anxiety effects). Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of lorazepam was observed, but no significant tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of etizolam was observed. Etizolam therefore has a reduced liability to induce tolerance, and dependence, compared with classic benzodiazepines. Pharmacology Etizolam pills Etizolam, a thienodiazepine derivative, is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved between 30 minutes and 2 hours. It has a mean elimination half life of about 3.4 hours. Etizolam possesses potent hypnotic properties, and is comparable with other short- acting benzodiazepines. Etizolam acts as a full agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor to produce its range of therapeutic and adverse effects. According to the Italian P.I. sheet, etizolam belongs to a new class of diazepines, thienotriazolodiazepines. This new class is easily oxidized, rapidly metabolized, and has a lower risk of accumulation, even after prolonged treatment. Etizolam has an anxiolytic action about 6 times greater than that of diazepam. Etizolam produces, especially at higher dosages, a reduction in time taken to fall asleep, an increase in total sleep time, and a reduction in the number of awakenings. During tests, there were no substantial changes in deep sleep; however, it may reduce REM sleep. In EEG tests of healthy volunteers, etizolam showed some similar characteristics to tricyclic antidepressants. Etizolam's main metabolites in humans are alpha- hydroxyetizolam and 8-hydroxyetizolam. Alpha-hydroxyetizolam is pharmacologically active and has a half-life of approximately 8.2 hours.  Interactions  Itraconazole and fluvoxamine slow down the rate of elimination of etizolam, leading to accumulation of etizolam, therefore increasing its pharmacological effects. Carbamazepine speeds up the metabolism of etizolam, resulting in reduced pharmacological effects. Overdose Cases of intentional suicide by overdose using etizolam in combination with GABA agonists have been reported. Although etizolam has a lower LD50 than certain benzodiazepines, the LD50 is still far beyond the prescribed or recommended dose. Flumazenil, a GABA antagonist agent used to reverse benzodiazepine overdoses, inhibits the effect of etizolam as well as classical benzodiazepines such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. Etizolam overdose deaths are rising - for instance, the National Records of Scotland report on drug-related deaths, implicated 548 deaths from 'street' Etizolam in 2018, almost double the number from 2017 (299) and only six years from the first recorded death (in 2012). The 548 deaths were 45% of all drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2018. Society and culture=Brand names Etilaam, Sedekopan, Etizest, Etizex, Pasaden or Depas Legal statusInternational drug control conventions= On December 13th 2019, the World Health Organization recommended Etizolam be placed in Schedule 4 of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. This recommendation was followed by the placement of Etizolam into Schedule IV in March 2020 =Australia= Etizolam is a Schedule 4 substance under the Poisons Standard June 2018 as it is classed as a benzodiazepine derivative.

As of March 2016, etizolam is a controlled substance in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia (as Schedule IV, whereas all other states listed here prohibit it as a Schedule I substance), Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, South Carolina, and Virginia. It is controlled in Indiana as of July 1, 2017. It is controlled in Ohio as of February 2018. Misuse Etizolam is a drug of potential misuse. Cases of etizolam dependence have been documented in the medical literature. However, conflicting reports from the World Health Organization, made public in 1991, dispute the misuse claims.WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence Since 1991, cases of etizolam misuse and addiction have substantially increased, due to varying levels of accessibility and cultural popularity.

Singer was invited to be a delegate at the University of Colorado annual Conference on World Affairs. In June 2001, Singer moved to North Central Florida. Working with the Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Geological Survey, Singer participated and documented the efforts of two organizations, Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) and the Woodville Karst Plain Project.http://www.gue.com/?q=en/Projects/WKPP/index.html Based in High Springs, the divers of G.U.E. and the W.K.P.P. are committed to exploring, understanding, and mapping the labyrinthine of water-filled cave systems that make up the Floridan aquifer. Both organizations have, in their explorations, pushed the outer limit of diving technology accumulating numerous world records in their respective fields of exploration. The short films made are now used as a tool in schools across Florida teaching children about the importance of water protection and conservation.http://www.floridadep.net/geology/news/sept2003_forum.pdf Starting from April 2005, Singer was embedded with a United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Platoon for 2 years, training and working on creating a new documentary film. Singer was deployed overseas along with the platoon, but unfortunately, the platoon did not receive the missions that they were expecting, and thus, insufficient footage was filmed to create a documentary.

Known for most of its length as Red Hill Road, the state highway runs from MD 7 east to the Delaware state line in Elkton in northeastern Cecil County. MD 281 and its continuation in Delaware were originally blazed in the 18th century as part of the Old Post Road between Baltimore and Philadelphia. The route was part of the Elk and Christiana Turnpike in the early 19th century and later the Old Baltimore Pike, but it was replaced as the main highway east from Elkton by U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in the early 20th century. MD 281 was constructed in Elkton in the early 1930s. The highway designation was extended east to the state line in the late 1950s; that extension was reconstructed in the early 1960s. Route description View east along MD 281 at MD 781 near Elkton MD 281 begins at an intersection with MD 7 in the town of Elkton. MD 7 continues west as Main Street and heads southeast as Delaware Avenue toward US 40. MD 281 heads east as two-lane undivided Main Street and leaves the town by crossing Big Elk Creek. The highway continues as Red Hill Road, which passes to the north of Grays Hill. The road comes to a roundabout with Muddy Lane/Kemp Lane. MD 281 meets the northern end of MD 781 (Delancy Road) before reaching its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line. The highway continues straight as Old Baltimore Pike toward Christiana. History What is now MD 281 and its continuation in Delaware was the Old Post Road used to connect Christiana Bridge with the head of the Elk River, and by extension Philadelphia and Baltimore, in the 18th century. Alternatively known as Old Baltimore Pike, this road was part of the Washington‚ÄìRochambeau Revolutionary Route used by the French army in September 1781 during their march from Newport, Rhode Island, to Yorktown, Virginia, during the Revolutionary War. In 1817, the Elk and Christiana Turnpike was completed along the path of the Old Post Road; the turnpike operated until 1838, when Old Baltimore Pike reverted to a public road. By the 1920s, the Old Baltimore Pike was supplanted by a parallel highway to the south from Elkton to Wilmington that was chosen as the route of US 40. The first segment of the modern MD 281 was constructed as a macadam road east from US 40 (now MD 7) on Main Street to Big Elk Creek between 1930 and 1933. In 1948, the Maryland State Roads Commission, which at the time maintained the major county highways in Cecil County, reconstructed much of Red Hill Road as a gravel road in 1948 before it was to be given a hard surface. The of highway from the west end of the Big Elk Creek bridge along Red Hill Road to the state line was transferred from county to state maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. MD 281 was reconstructed from Big Elk Creek to the state line in 1960 and 1961; this work included a new four-span, steel beam bridge across Big Elk Creek. The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from MD 7 to Big Elk Creek in 1968 and from the creek to Delaware in 1973. In 2017, construction took place on a $3.1 million project to build a roundabout at Muddy Lane/Kemp Lane; this roundabout opened to traffic in October of that year.

The clotiazepam molecule differs from benzodiazepines in that the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring. It possesses anxiolytic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative properties. Stage 2 NREM sleep is significantly increased by clotiazepam. Indications Clotiazepam has been trialed and found to be effective in the short-term management of anxiety. Clotiazepam is also used as a premedicant in minor surgery in France and Japan, where the drug is commercially available under the brand names Veratran and Rize, respectively.Official Japanese Drug Information Sheet (Kusuri-no- Shiori)French Guide to Medicines - Clotiazepam (Veratran) Pharmacokinetics A cross-over study in six healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) was conducted using single-dose pharmacokinetics of 5 mg clotiazepam drops, oral tablets, and sublingual tablets. The formulations had similar systemic availability. Compared with oral tablets, the sublingual route gave a lower peak concentration and a delayed peak time, while drops gave a greater maximum concentration with a similar peak time. The use of drops is suggested for a more marked initial effect and the sublingual route for easier administration, especially in the elderly. Pharmacology Similar to other benzodiazepines clotiazepam has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant pharmacological properties. Clotiazepam binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor where it acts as a full agonist; this action results in an enhanced GABA inhibitory effect at the GABAA receptor which results in the pharmacological effects of clotiazepam. Clotiazepam has a short elimination half-life and is less prone to accumulation after repeated dosing compared to longer-acting benzodiazepine agents. It is metabolised via oxidation. Clotiazepam is metabolised to hydroxy-clotiazepam and desmethyl-clotiazepam. After oral ingestion of a single 5 mg dose of clotiazepam by three healthy volunteers the drug was rapidly absorbed. The elimination half-life of the drug and its metabolites range from 6.5 hours to 18 hours. Clotiazepam is 99 percent bound to plasma protein. In elderly men the elimination half-life is longer and in elderly women the volume of distribution is increased. Individuals with liver impairment have a reduced volume of distribution as well as a reduced total clearance of clotiazepam; renal impairment does not affect the kinetics of clotiazepam. The dose equivalent to 10mg diazepam is thought to be between 5 and 10mg clotiazepam. Side effects Side effects experienced with this product will resemble those of other benzodiazepines. Drowsiness and asthenia are common side effects. There has been a report of hepatitis caused by clotiazepam. Abuse Clotiazepam is a recognised drug of abuse.

He was nicknamed Cacha√≠to (\\"little Cachao\\") after his uncle, the famous bassist and innovator of mambo music Israel \\"Cachao\\" L√≥pez. His father and Cachao's older brother was Orestes L√≥pez, also a famous bassist/multi-instrumentalist and composer. Life and career Born in Havana on February 2, 1933, Orlando \\"Cacha√≠to\\" L√≥pez first got actively involved in music when he was only nine years old. His early desire was to play the violin, but his grandfather Pedro insisted he take up the double bass, as there had been a long tradition of bassists in the L√≥pez family, a trend that they did not want stopped. He started learning the double bass on a cello, quickly moving onto a double bass when he was large enough. His musical career is said to have started when he was twelve, and at the age of 13, Cacha√≠to composed his first piece, a danz√≥n called \\"Isora Infantil\\", a reference to his aunt Coralia's famous piece \\"Isora Club\\". In fact, it was Coralia's orchestra were Cacha√≠to made his debut in the 1940s. By the time he was 17, he replaced his uncle as the bassist with Antonio Arca√±o y sus Maravillas. He made such an impression on the group that he was asked to stay. In the 1950s, he helped popularize the descarga style of music that is a mix between jazz-styled improvisation with Afro-Cuban rhythms, and by 1957 he was playing with the hugely popular Havana dance band, Orquesta Riverside. In the 1960s, he became a bassist with the National Symphony Orchestra, and he took classes with the Czech bassist Karel Kopriva. Cacha√≠to also collaborated with renowned pianists Peruch√≠n, Frank Emilio Flynn and Chucho Vald√©s, as well as percussionists Tata G√ºines and Ang√° D√≠az. In 1996 L√≥pez was hired by Juan de Marcos Gonz√°lez for his Afro-Cuban All Stars, signing to World Circuit, and at the same time becoming a member of the resulting Buena Vista Social Club project and appearing in Wim Wenders' documentary Buena Vista Social Club. After a career spanning some 60 years, Cacha√≠to made his debut solo album in 2001 and continued to tour with the Buena Vista Social Club musicians (Manuel \\"Guajiro\\" Mirabal, Jes√∫s \\"Aguaje\\" Ramos, Manuel Galb√°n, etc.). Cacha√≠to died in a hospital in Havana on February 9, 2009, after complications from pancreatic cancer surgery. He was 76.

The expedition started from Ellesmere Island on March 8, 1990 and reached the North Pole 58 days later on May 4, 1990. They traveled approximately 800 kilometers on skis pulling their supplies on sledges.National Geographic Magazine, March 1991 Less than three years later, in 1992‚Äì93, Kagge completed the first unsupported and solo expedition to the South Pole, covering the 814-mile (1,310 km) route in 50 days. Kagge had no radio contact to the outside world for the duration of this expedition, which was featured on the cover of the international edition of TIME magazine on March 1, 1993. In 1994, Kagge summited Mount Everest, thus becoming the first person to complete the \\"Three Poles Challenge\\". For two years during this period, Kagge worked as a lawyer for industrial giant Norsk Hydro. Kagge has also sailed across the Atlantic twice and around Cape Horn. After his record- breaking feat of reaching the \\"three poles\\", Kagge attended Cambridge University to study philosophy for three terms. In 1996, he founded Oslo-based publishing house, Kagge Forlag, which today is one of Norway‚Äôs leading book publishing companies. In 2000 Kagge Forlag acquired one of Norway‚Äôs oldest publishing companies, J.M. Stenersens Forlag. Kagge and Stenersens publish approximately 100 new titles annually. These days it is Norway's biggest publisher of nonfiction.https://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/karer-kagge-til- sakprosa-vinner-1.904423 Kagge has written seven books on exploration, philosophy and art collecting, which have been translated into 39 languageshttps://norla.no/nb/books/769-silence-in-the-age-of-noise-the-joy-of- shutting-out-the-world.

Kagge continues to do expeditions, although with a lower profile than in the nineties. In 2010 he and urban historian and photographer Steve Duncan descended into the sewers, subways and water tunnels of New York - walking for five days from the Bronx, via Manhattan, to the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. In 2012 he walked the entire length of Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard over three days with Petter Skavlan and Peder Lund. In December 2019 Kagge, Skavlan and Lund walked the entire length of New York's Broadway - from Sleepy Hollow to the tip of Manhattan - in 24 hours. In addition to running his publishing business and writing, Kagge is a leading collector of international contemporary art.

Chapman was the leader of the Latter-day Saint settlers in Manti, Utah, from 1854 to 1862, and helped broker peace between the settlers and Chief Wakara's tribe. Childhood Chapman was born in 1805 in Readsboro, Vermont,His grandfather, Throope Chapman, helped establish the settlement four miles down the river from fellow leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints leader Brigham Young.Young was born Whitingham, Vermont four years earlier. He apprenticed as a stonemason in his early teens, but because his parents deemed him \\"sickly,\\" they leveraged a relative's connections to secure him a position as cook on a fishing boat. He worked both in the North Atlantic and on Lake Champlain. The time at sea reportedly improved his health. Marriage and Conversion In between fishing expeditions he met Susan Amelia Risley (1807‚Äì1888), daughter of a prominent Madison County, New York couple. They disapproved of the relationship because they believed his occupation was too unstable to support a family. In response, Chapman abandoned fishing and took steps toward returning to stone cutting. The Risleys relented, and Chapman married Amelia in about 1831. The Chapmans made their home in a hamlet known as Hubbardsville in Madison County, where they had four children, all daughters. The first two were twins who died in infancy. While in Hubbardsville, they joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. First Welcome joined, to which Amelia reacted harshly, declaring \\"You have went and joined those awful Mormons.\\" However, she joined the church about six months later. Because they joined an unpopular religion, their friends and neighbors shunned them and appeared to look down on them, the prominence of Amelia's parents notwithstanding. The Risleys were broken-hearted over their daughter joining the Latter-day Saints, but they did not turn bitter. However, Welcome's parents disowned him. The Chapmans soon moved to a Latter Day Saint community, possibly Kirtland, Ohio,They are not listed on the Kirtland tax rolls, and he is not listed as a worker on the Kirtland Temple, despite his stone cutting skills but more likely Jackson County and then Far West, Missouri.Smith, Arlene M. \\"Times and Places of Welcome Chapman,\\" 1997.

There, Amelia gave birth to another daughter in October 1846. Two months earlier, Brigham Young divided the Winter Quarters settlement into two \\"grand divisions\\" presided over by himself and Heber C. Kimball, respectively. Each division had two subdivisions presided over by a foreman. Chapman was foreman of the fourth subdivision, with Hosea Stout serving as its clerk.Stone, Wayne. History of Hosea Stout. pp. 80, 84. In the summer of 1848, the Chapmans crossed the plains with their six surviving children to what later became Utah Territory. Settling Utah The Chapmans had their final child, a son named Welcome Chapman, Jr., in the Salt Lake Valley in Fall 1849. About the same time, Brigham Young asked Chapman to help colonize the Sanpitch (now Sanpete) Valley with Isaac Morley.Findlay, Linnie T.M. \\"Welcome Chapman\\". Saga of the Sanpitch. 1989. Vol. 21, pp. 111‚Äì118. They arrived in November 1849 and endured a harsh winter with little shelter. Chapman was part of the first militia of Manti and used his stone cutting skills to help construct the first fort.Conquerors of the West: Stalwart Mormon Pioneers. Florence C. Youngberg, ed. Agreka Books. 1998, p. 510. . He was also among the first group of selectmen. The young colony experienced great difficulties, but gradually began to prosper. Sanpete Valley On April 30, 1851, Brigham Young called Chapman to be part of the first High Council of the Manti Area Branch in Manti, Utah.Journal History of the Church, April 30, 1851.

Amelia was born into a family of seven girls and five boys on a flax farm in upstate New York. Her mother taught the girls reading and mathematics, as well as how to cord, spin and weave wool and linen.Chapman, John Davis. Welcome and Susan Amelia (Risley) Chapman. Provo, Utah. When the Chapmans first arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, Amelia turned most of the housework over to her 12- and 14-year-old daughters while she focused on weaving linsey-woolsey cloth, which the young community badly needed. Contemporary accounts consider Amelia an excellent cook and housekeeper and an authority on herbal medicine. She served as a practical doctor and nurse to \\"neighbors for many miles around\\" and as a midwife. She assisted in the births of some of her grandchildren and great- grandchildren. She was more educated than her husband, which helped him during his active public life. After the Chapmans relocated to Manti, Brigham Young and other authorities from Salt Lake made the Chapman home, which was better furnished than most neighbors, their headquarters when visiting Sanpete. Chapman in his later years After Wakara died in 1855, his brother, Arapeen, succeeded him as war chief. Although the brief Wakara War was over, tensions between the Latter-day Saints and the Ute Indians in Sanpete still existed. In early 1857 Arapeen reported having a vision in which Wakara came to him with a message of peace. In the vision Wakara specifically instructed him to pass this message on to Chapman and two others. B.H. Roberts believed it was the peace that ensued that enabled Arapeen to accompany Brigham Young on an expedition to present-day Idaho, where Young made peace with the Bannocks.Roberts, B.H. Comprehensive History of the Church. Salt Lake City, Utah. 1902. Vol. IV, Ch. XCIV In Manti, Chapman practiced plural marriage. He married Ann Mackey on October 5, 1855, and Catherine Stainer on March 5, 1856. He had a large family with each of these women, in addition to the family he had with Amelia. (He also possibly married two women who left him shortly thereafter.) Chapman was a founding owner of the San Pete Coal Company, incorporated by act of the Territorial Legislature on January 8, 1856. After serving as the leader in Manti for eight years, Brigham Young called him to Salt Lake City to cut stone for the Salt Lake Temple, where Chapman often worked with a son at his side. At one point he worked alongside seven of them.Chapman, Samuel Welcome. \\"History of Welcome Chapman Sr.\\". http://www.livingstonfamily.org/wiki/CHAPMAN%2C_Welcome_- _History_of_Welcome_Chapman_Sr%2E.

He earned supplemental income in Salt Lake City by cutting and hauling wood to Fort Douglas, where he sold it to the soldiers. In either late November or early December 1893, at the age of 88, Chapman reportedly rode a horse bareback for three miles to build a chimney on the house of his third wife, Catherine. Chilled through after building the chimney and riding home again through the cold, he developed pneumonia. He died soon after in Fountain Green, Utah on December 9, 1893, and was buried in Manti.

Protected on June 2, 1981, the park includes of coastline, and an interior composed of rolling sand dunes. During the rainy season, the valleys among the dunes fill with freshwater lagoons, prevented from draining due to the impermeable rock beneath. The park is home to a range of species, including four listed as endangered, and has become a popular destination for ecotourists.  Physical geography  The park is located on the northeastern coast of Brazil in the state of Maranh√£o along the eastern coast, bordered by of beaches along Atlantic Ocean. Inland, it is bordered by the Parna√≠ba River, the S√£o Jos√© Basin, and the rivers of Itapecuru, Munim, and Peri√°. The park encompasses an area of , composed mainly of expansive coastal dune fields (composed of barchanoid dunes), which formed during the late Quaternary period. While much of the park has the appearance of a desert, the area receives about of rain per year, while deserts, by definition, receive less than annually. About 70% of this rainfall occurs between the months of January and May. The sand is carried to the park from the interior of the continent by the Parna√≠ba and Pregui√ßas rivers, where it is then driven back inland up to by winds, creating a series of sand dunes rising as much as tall. During the rainy season, between the months of January and June, the rainstorms fill the spaces among the dunes with fresh water lagoons of up to in length and in depth, and together comprising as much as 41% of the area of the park. The water in the lagoons is prevented from draining by a layer of impermeable rock located beneath the sandy surface. The lagoons typically have a temperature between and , pH of between 4.9 and 6.2, and low levels of dissolved nutrients. When the dry season returns, the pools quickly evaporate, losing as much as of depth per month. In the interior of the park are located two oases or restingas, Queimada do Britos, covering an area of , and Baixa Grande, covering an area of . The area of the park has an average annual temperature of between and and an annual temperature variation of about 1.1 ¬∞C (2 ¬∞F). Ecology The lagoons in the park are often interconnected with one another, as well as with the rivers that run through the area. They are home to a number of fish and insect species, including the wolf fish, which burrows down into wet layers of mud and remains dormant during the dry season. Besides the dunes that form the centerpiece of the park, the ecosystem also includes area of restinga and mangrove ecosystems. The park is home to four species listed on the Brazilian List of Endangered Species, the scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), the oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) and the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). The park also includes 133 species of plants, 112 species of birds, and at least 42 species of reptiles.  Tourism  Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses National Park receives as many as 60,000 visitors a year, and is a popular destination for ecotourism, given its unique physical features. Common activities within the park include \\"night sky observation, surfing, bicycle touring, canoeing, ecotourism, adventure tourism, rustic camping, horseback riding, and all- terrain vehicle...and water tours.\\" The best route of entry is flight to the regional capital of S√£o Lu√≠s, and then travel by jeep to the interior of the park from Barreirinhas. In popular culture The park was featured in the Brazilian film The House of Sand. Kadhal Anukkal, a song from an Indian Tamil language film Enthiran starring Rajnikanth and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was also shot here. The films Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) used the park's landscape as the planet of Vormir.

The historic river-port of Fort Donelson was named for him as a Brigadier in the Tennessee militia, early in the American Civil War, in which he went on to serve as a Confederate general, notably at Perryville and Stones River. He was the nephew of America's seventh president, Andrew Jackson. Early life Portrait of Daniel Smith Donelson by George Dury, circa 1850 Donelson was born in Sumner County, Tennessee, one of the three sons of Samuel and Mary \\"Polly\\" Smith Donelson. Donelson's father died when Donelson was about five. When his mother remarried, Donelson moved to The Hermitage, the home of his aunt, Rachel Donelson Jackson, and her husband, future President of the United States Andrew Jackson. Rachel and Andrew Jackson adopted Donelson and his two brothers. His older brother, Andrew Jackson Donelson, was the private secretary to Jackson during his presidency and a vice presidential candidate in his own right. Donelson's paternal grandfather was Colonel John Donelson, a frontiersman and founder of Nashville, Tennessee, and his maternal grandfather, Colonel Daniel Smith, was a Revolutionary War officer, an early leader in middle Tennessee and one of Tennessee's first U.S. Senators. In 1821, Donelson entered West Point, and graduated in 1825, becoming a United States Army officer. He resigned his commission only half a year later, on January 22, 1826, to become a planter in Sumner County. He was also a member of the militia in Tennessee, starting as a brigade major in 1827 and being promoted to brigadier general in 1829. In 1834, Donelson resigned his commission in the Tennessee militia and moved to Florida, again working as a planter until 1836. His stay there was brief, however, and he moved back to Tennessee two years later, still a planter. In 1841, Donelson became a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. He left after one two-year term in 1841-1843, but returned 12 years later, in 1855, serving in 1855-1861 and this time rising to the office of Speaker for 1859-1861.

Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Donelson volunteered again for the Tennessee militia, leaving behind both of his careers as a planter and as Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. He was returned to his previous rank of brigadier general in the militia and that May approved the locations of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the latter named in his honor. (Fort Henry would turn out to be a disastrous choice, being almost flooded and easily captured by Grant). After Tennessee joined the Confederacy, he became a brigadier general in the Confederate Army on July 9, 1861. In the following two years, Donelson was active in several campaigns, including Robert E. Lee's Western Virginia Campaign of 1861, leading the initial assault at the Battle of Perryville, and fighting at the Battle of Stones River. He was then transferred briefly to South Carolina to help defend Charleston and the inner coastal region. Afterwards he eventually rose to command of the Department of East Tennessee. Donelson was promoted to major general on March 5, 1863 (to rank from January 17); his confirmation by the Confederate Senate on April 22 happened prior to its knowledge of his death, which had occurred a week earlier. He died of chronic diarrhea at the mineral water resort Montvale Springs, near Knoxville, Tennessee. He was buried in the Presbyterian Cemetery in Hendersonville, Tennessee.Eicher, p. 212.

He was also known as Race G√ºnther (Rasseng√ºnther) or Race Pope (Rassenpapst). He is considered to have been a major influence on Nazi racialist thought. He taught at the universities of Jena, Berlin, and Freiburg, writing numerous books and essays on racial theory. G√ºnther's Short Ethnology of the German People (1929) was a popular exposition of Nordicism. In May 1930, he was appointed to a new chair of racial theory at Jena. He joined the Nazi Party in 1932 as the only leading racial theorist to join the party before it assumed power in 1933.Donna F. Ryan, John S. Schuchman. 2002. Deaf People in Hitler's Europe. Gallaudet University Press p. 19 Life and career Pages 34-5 of Short Ethnology of the German People. On the left page (right of two) there is an image of Josef Stalin as representative of the Armenoid race while on the right page (bottom two of four) there are two images of Jews from Germany and Austria respectively, described as \\"mainly Near Eastern\\", which is also known as Armenoid. G√ºnther was the son of a musician. He studied comparative linguistics at Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg, but also attended lectures on zoology and geography. In 1911, he spent a semester at the Sorbonne, Paris. He attained his doctorate in 1914. In the same year he enlisted in the infantry at the outbreak of World War I, but became sick and was hospitalized. He was declared unfit for combat, so to compensate for his inability to fight, he served with the Red Cross. In 1919, after the end of the war, he started his writing career. He wrote a polemical work entitled \\"The Knight, death and the devil: the heroic idea\\", a reworking of the tradition of German v√∂lkisch-nationalist Romanticism into a form of \\"biological nationalism\\". Heinrich Himmler was very impressed by this book. In 1922 G√ºnther studied at the University of Vienna while working in a museum in Dresden. In 1923 he moved to Scandinavia to live with his second wife, who was Norwegian. He received scientific awards from the University of Uppsala and the Swedish Institute for Race Biology, headed by Herman Lundborg. In Norway he met Vidkun Quisling. In May 1930 he was appointed to the University of Jena by Wilhelm Frick who had become the first NSDAP minister in a state government when he was appointed minister of education in the right-wing coalition government formed in Thuringen following an election in December 1929. In 1935 he became a professor at the University of Berlin, teaching race science, human biology and rural ethnography. From 1940 to 1945 he was professor at Albert Ludwigs University. He received several honors during the Third Reich, notably in 1935 he was declared \\"pride of the NSDAP\\" for his scientific work. In the same year he received the Rudolph Virchow plaque, and in 1940 the Goethe Medal for arts and science from Hitler. In March 1941, he was received as an honored guest for the opening conference of Alfred Rosenberg's \\"Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question\\". At the conference the obliteration of Jewish identity, or \\"people death\\" (Volkstod) of the Jews was discussed. Various proposals were made, including the \\"pauperization of European Jews and hard labor in massive camps in Poland\\". G√ºnther's only recorded comment was that the meeting was boring. After World War II, G√ºnther was placed in internment camps for three years until it was concluded that, though he was a part of the Nazi system, he was not an instigator of its criminal acts, making him less accountable for the consequences of his actions. The University of Freiburg came to his defense at his post-war trial. Nevertheless, even after Nazi Germany's fall, he did not revise his thinking, denying the Holocaust until his death. In 1951 he published the book How to choose a husband in which he listed good biological qualities to look for in marriage partners. He continued to argue that sterilization should remain a legal option, and played down the mandatory sterilization used in Nazi Germany. Another eugenics book was published in 1959 in which he argued that unintelligent people reproduce too numerously in Europe, and the only solution was state-sponsored family planning. Racial theories G√ºnther's theories arose from the Nordicist ideology prevalent at the time. Eugen Fischer, the professor of anthropology in Freiburg, was an influential proponent of these ideas and had lectured at Albert Ludwigs University when G√ºnther studied there. G√ºnther wrote that a race could be identified in the following manner. This definition of \\"race\\" was used in Nazi propaganda. G√ºnther in his writings was quick to mark out the distinction between \\"race\\" and \\"Volk\\". He acknowledged that both the Germans and Jews were not \\"races\\" in the strictest sense of the word but thought that it would cause no harm to refer to the latter as such in non-scientific popular racial works. Similarly, he rejected the usage of \\"Aryan\\" and \\"Semitic\\" as racial terms (he argued they were only linguistic terms) and stated that regarding them as such would cause more problems in distinguishing between Germans and Jews. G√ºnther described in a chapter of one of his works \\"Racial Characteristics of the Jewish People\\" that Jews belonged predominantly to the \\"Near Eastern Race\\" (Vorderasiatische). He thought that Jews had become so racially mixed that they could possibly be regarded as a \\"race of the second order\\". He described Ashkenazi Jews as being mixed of Near Eastern, Oriental, East Baltic, Inner-Asian, Nordic, Hamite, and Negro, and Sephardic Jews as being mixed of Oriental, Near Eastern, Western, Hamite, Nordic, and Negro. He believed that Jews had different physical characteristics to Europeans. G√ºnther in his 1927 book The Racial Elements of European History outlined the differences between racial and linguistic definitions: G√ºnther divided the European populations into six races, the Nordic, Phalic, Eastern, Western, Dinaric and East Baltic. \\"Western\\" and \\"Eastern\\" were, in practice, alternatives for the more widely used terms \\"Mediterranean\\" and \\"Alpine\\". The \\"Phalic\\" race was a minor category dropped in many of his writings. G√ºnther in his book Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (Racial Science of the German People) categorized Germans as belonging to the Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine and East Baltic races. In the book, he argued for Germans to avoid race mixing. Opposed to the Nordics were the Jews, who were \\"a thing of ferment and disturbance, a wedge driven by Asia into the European structure.\\"Anne Maxwell, Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870-1940, p. 153 G√ºnther argued that the Nordic peoples should unite to secure their dominance. Although G√ºnther seemed to admire Mediterraneans and Dinarics, as well as the highly praised Nordics, the East Baltic race was considered inferior in nearly every instance G√ºnther mentioned it in his book, The Racial Elements of European History. G√ºnther believed Slavic people to be of an \\"Eastern race\\" separate from Germany and Nordics and warned about mixing \\"German blood\\" with Slavic one.Wulf D. Hund, Racisms Made in Germany, (2011), p. 19 Among G√ºnther's disciples was Bruno Beger who, after the 1938‚Äì39 German expedition to Tibet, concluded that the Tibetan peoples had characteristics that placed them between the Nordic and Mongol races, and were thus superior to other East Asians. Influence on Adolf Hitler Timothy Ryback, who examined the books retrieved from Adolf Hitler's private collection, notes that Hitler owned six books by G√ºnther, four of which were different editions of Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (Racial Science of the German People).Timothy Ryback, Hitler's Private Library: The Books that Shaped His Life (New York: Knopf, 2008), 110. These were given to him by G√ºnther's publisher Julius Lehmann, who inscribed three of them. The earliest, a third edition from 1923, is for \\"the successful champion of German racial thinking,\\" while the 1928 edition bears a \\"Christmas greeting.\\" The 1933 sixteenth edition, with a detailed appendix on European Jews, shows signs of extended, sustained use. Lehmann dedicated it to \\"the trailblazer of racial thinking.\\" Ryback notes that Hitler included G√ºnther's book on a list of books recommended for all Nazis to read.Timothy Ryback, Hitler's Private Library: The Books that Shaped His Life (New York: Knopf, 2008), 69. Ryback does not cite a source for this list, which may have been a book list distributed by Alfred Rosenberg's Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur.

The document was a draft being revised to be consistent with the Bush doctrine of preemptive attack. Doctrine The doctrine cites eight reasons under which field commanders can ask for permission to use thermonuclear weapons: *An enemy using or threatening to use WMD against the US, multinational, or alliance forces or civilian populations. *To prevent an imminent biological attack. *To attack enemy WMD launch facilities or its underground hardened CIC & storage bunkers containing deployable WMD, launch and delivery vehicles which could be used to target the US or its allies. *To stop potentially overwhelming conventional enemy forces. *To rapidly end a war on favorable US terms. *To ensure the US and international operations are successful. *To show the US intent, capability and willingness to rapidly escalate from conventional weapons to Nuclear Defense Posture; using thermonuclear weapons to deter the enemy from using WMDs. *To react to enemy-supplied WMD and indirect use by proxy states against the US, allied nations and international coalition forces, or alliance and coalition civilian populations. Overview Below are some quotes from the executive summary of the document. Note: After public exposure, the Pentagon has hidden the Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations and three related documents, referring to this as \\"cancelling\\" the documents.Pentagon Cancels Controversial Nuclear Doctrine, 2 February 2006, FAS The decision to \\"cancel\\" the documents simply removes controversial documents from the public domain and from the Pentagon's internal reading list. The White House and Pentagon guidance that directs the use of nuclear weapons remains unchanged by the cancellation.U.S. Nuclear Weapons Guidance, last update 16 March 2006, FAS \\"The use of nuclear weapons represents a significant escalation from conventional warfare and may be provoked by some action, event, or threat. However, like any military action, the decision to use nuclear weapons is driven by the political objective sought.\\"... \\"Integrating conventional and nuclear attacks will ensure the most efficient use of force and provide US leaders with a broader range of strike options to address immediate contingencies‚Ä¶ This integration will ensure optimal targeting, minimal collateral damage, and reduce the probability of escalation.\\" ... \\"Although the United States may not know with confidence what threats a state, combinations of states, or nonstate actors pose to US interests, it is possible to anticipate the capabilities an adversary might use‚Ä¶ These capabilities require maintaining a diverse mix of conventional forces capable of high-intensity, sustained, and coordinated actions across the range of military operations; employed in concert with survivable and secure nuclear forces\\" ... \\"The immediate and prolonged effects of nuclear weapons including blast (overpressure, dynamic pressure, ground shock, and cratering), thermal radiation (fire and other material effects), and nuclear radiation (initial, residual, fallout, blackout, and electromagnetic pulse), impose physical and psychological challenges for combat forces and noncombatant populations alike. These effects also pose significant survivability requirements on military equipment, supporting civilian infrastructure resources, and host-nation/coalition assets. US forces must prepare to survive and perhaps operate in a nuclear/radiological environment.\\" In 2010 U.S. President Barack Obama, in a Nuclear Posture Review, announced a new policy that is much stricter about when the U.S. would order a nuclear strike.

Unlike other anxiolytic benzodiazepines (which are generally 1,4- or 1,5-substituted) however, tofisopam does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing or amnestic properties. While it may not be an anticonvulsant in and of itself, it has been shown to enhance the anticonvulsant action of classical 1,4-benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) and muscimol, but not sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin. Tofisopam is indicated for the treatment of anxiety and alcohol withdrawal, and is prescribed in a dosage of 50‚Äì300 mg per day divided into three doses. Peak plasma levels are attained two hours after an oral dose. Tofisopam is not reported as causing dependence to the same extent as other benzodiazepines, but is still recommended to be prescribed for a maximum of 12 weeks. Tofisopam is not approved for sale in the United States or Canada. However, Vela Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey is developing the D-enantiomer (dextofisopam) as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, with moderate efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials so far. Tofisopam is also claimed to be a PDE10A inhibitor, which may provide an alternative mechanism of action for its various therapeutic effects, and this action has been proposed to make tofisopam potentially useful as a treatment for schizophrenia.Nielsen EB, Kehler J, Nielsen J, Br√∏sen P.

As a parachurch apostolate, membership is open to any baptized Christian who affirms the Nicene Creed and agrees to the community's covenant. The majority of its members are Catholics, but Protestants can also join, reflecting the ecumenical nature of People of Praise. It has 22 branches in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean, with approximately 1,700 members. It founded Trinity Schools, which are aligned with the philosophy of classical Christian education. People of Praise was formed in 1971 by Kevin Ranaghan and Paul DeCelles. Both men were involved in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, in which Pentecostal religious experiences such as baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues and prophecy are practiced by Catholics. In its early history, it influenced the institutional development of the Catholic Charismatic movement in the United States and played important roles in national charismatic conferences. People of Praise practices a form of spiritual direction that involves the supervision of a member by a more \\"spiritually mature\\" person called a \\"head\\". People of Praise maintains that members retain their freedom of conscience under such direction. The community, like the Catholic Church, has few women in leadership positions. It nevertheless encourages women to pursue higher education and employment.  History  The founding of People of Praise by Kevin Ranaghan and Paul DeCelles in 1971 in South Bend, Indiana, while the two were graduate students, was an early and important event within the history of the overall covenant community movement. Various individuals who participated in its founding had attended Cursillo movement retreats, including another graduate student, Stephen B. Clark (who came to author Building Christian Communities in 1972). In 1963, after having attended the Archdiocesan Cursillo Center in Chicago, Clark organized a Cursillo retreat in South Bend. Influenced both by Cursillo, local prayer meetings were formed. After Bill Storey visited from Duquesne University in 1967, elements from out of as well the burgeoning Catholic charismatic renewal of the times, were incorporated into these meetings. Eventually several Catholic covenant communities were formed. After Word of God community formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1967, and the True House (1971-1974) and People of Praise communities (1971-present) were formed in South Bend.https://www.academia.edu/34958325/Not_Reliable_Guides (Others formed since then include Sword of the Spirit, the Mother of God Community as well as constituent members of the North American Network of Charismatic Covenant Communities.https://www.ncregister.com/features/the-people-of-praise- community-what-it-actually- ishttps://www.presentationministries.com/view/info-2020-04-22-north-american- network-of-charismatic-communities-nan) Such communities were influenced by the 1960s Jesus movement as well as perhaps some of the communitarianism of that era's counterculture. Historical theologian Paul Thigpen writes that in general these communities \\"typically involved a commitment to at least some degree of sharing financial resources, regular participation in community gatherings, and submission to the direction of the group‚Äôs designated authorities.\\" Larger communities were often divided into \\"households\\", which did not always mean members were living in the same house. However, members of the same household needed to live close enough to each other to share meals, prayer times and other forms of fellowship. Most households were made up of one or two families, but others might be for single men or women. People of Praise experienced early growth recruiting from major universities and was especially closely connected to the University of Notre Dame. The group helped develop important institutions for the larger Catholic Charismatic movement. Until 1990, the South Bend community was the headquarters for the National Service Committee (a coordinating body for the various Catholic charismatic groups). It was also the headquarters of the Charismatic Renewal Services (a national distribution center for religious books and tapes) and published a magazine called New Heaven, New Earth. It also played a major role in the renewal's annual national conferences. By 1987, People of Praise had around 3,000 members, including children.\\"as early as 1987, People of Praise consisted of some 3,000 people including children\\" Stanley Burgess Encyclopedia of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity. Routledge, New York, London, 2006. p. 130. By the end of the 1980s, Catholics were 92 percent of the membership. The overall Catholic charismatic renewal had begun in the United States in 1967 and saw Pentecostal religious experience and practices such as baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues embraced by members of the Catholic Church. People of Praise became involved with the international body of the Renewal movement is the International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services, located first in Brussels and later in Rome. They have also worked ecumenically through participation in the International Charismatic Consultation, the Charismatic Concerns Committee, the Charismatic Leaders Fellowship\\"group of charismatic leaders that formed the Charismatic Concerns Committee (CCC) in the early 1970s. The CCC was later re-named the Charismatic Leaders Fellowship,\\" http://www.christianhealingmin.org/whoare.htm and, more recently, in the Rome-based Gathering in the Holy Spirit. Members also served with Cardinal Josef Suenens in drafting of Malines Documents I and II, and with Father Kilian McDonnell, in the writing of Fanning the Flame.Fanning the Flame: What Does Baptism in the Holy Spirit Have to Do with Christian Initiation? Edited by George Montague and Killian McDonnell (Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1991). These documents have contributed to the articulation and understanding of charismatic renewal and its place in the Catholic Church. They have also contributed to an understanding of how this movement can be understood by members of Protestant denominations of Christianity. The group has drawn media interest due to Judge Amy Coney Barrett's association with the group. Numerous media outlets have reported that Barrett is a member. In the wake of heightened interest in the group and its members following her nomination, People of Praise removed some materials from its website: \\"Recent changes to our website were made in consultation with members and nonmembers from around the country who raised concerns about their and their families' privacy due to heightened media attention.\\" Description People of Praise defines itself as an ecumenical, charismatic covenant community \\"of families and single people who seek to participate in the mission of the church in our time and to live our lives communally\\". Members live in their own homes, and sometimes single people will live with an unrelated family. There are some households in which only single men or single women live together. People of Praise is not a church. All members of the community simultaneously remain members of their local parishes. The majority of its members are Catholics, with Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians also represented. The Spirit and Purpose of the People of Praise state that \\"we will live our lives together as fully as our churches permit, with the hope that we may soon attain a unity of faith in the fullness of Christ our Lord.\\"Spirit and Purpose of the People of Praise People of Praise, Inc., 1986. Members of the People of Praise engage in weekly meetings that include religious teaching, Scripture readings, witnessing, and prayer for those with needs. Local groups may also hold charismatic prayer meetings and meet for dinner, fellowship and praise and worship. Members also meet in small groups. Anthropologist Thomas Csordas has written that People of Praise is theologically conservative with a hierarchical leadership structure, but it is also influenced by the communitarianism of the 1960s counterculture.  Covenant  The People of Praise considers itself to be a \\"covenant community.\\" The community considers the covenant, when entered into among members, to be one of mutual care and service in spiritual, material, and financial matters.Spirit and Purpose. People of Praise, 1971. The covenant is not an oath or vow; a member is released from it if they believe God is calling them to another way of life. The covenant states: Membership is open to all baptized Christians who believe in the Nicene Creed. There are two stages of membership in the community: underway and covenanted. People who are new to the community join as underway members. This stage of membership is meant as a time for people new to the community to freely explore (in consultation with the leadership) whether they belong in the community. While a member is underway, he or she actively participates in all aspects of community life. Full membership occurs when one makes a public commitment to the covenant. Members make this pledge freely after a formation and instruction period that normally lasts three to six years.  Organizational leadership  People of Praise is led by an eleven- member all-male board of governors, the chairman of which is the overall coordinator. The board's responsibilities include electing the overall coordinator, establishing new branches, determining official teachings, approving the budget, and approving appointments made by the overall coordinator. Board members serve for six-year terms and cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Each location of the community is called a branch. The larger branches are led by a group of branch coordinators. These branches are divided into areas, which are each led by an area coordinator. The principal branch coordinator serves as the main leader of the branch. Smaller or newer branches are led by a team of branch leaders. All these coordinators or branch leaders are selected from among the covenanted men in a branch. On matters of great importance, consultations involving all full or \\"covenanted\\" members of the community guide the direction of the community, including (within a branch) the selection of coordinators. Branch members nominate three people, and one is selected to be a coordinator by the overall coordinator.  Headships and laypastor‚Äìpenitent relationships  Spiritual direction is an important part of People of Praise intentional community, which takes the form of headships or lay-pastoral counselling; according to anthropologist Thomas Csordas, \\"individual members are supervised in their daily lives by a person regarded as more 'spiritually mature. Pastoral care is considered an important service within the community; it is believed to foster relationships of love, service and charismatic ministry. Each member has someone called a \\"head\\", who acts as a personal adviser. Influenced by Ignatian spirituality (the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola), heads, in general, give encouragement, correction, and help in decision-making. Men have other men as their heads. Married women are headed by their husbands. Single women and widows usually have other women as their heads. Men and women with the appropriate skills are assigned as heads by the coordinators. People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola as a basis for counsel and discernment. According to Sean Connolly, communications director for People of Praise, functions of lay-pastoral counsellors and prayer meeting leaders within the community are not authoritarian in nature: \\"Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences, as formed by the light of reason, experience, and the teachings of their churches.\\" As a charismatic community, People of Praise recognizes prophecy as one of the spiritual gifts or charisms. Leaders of the community will consider the meaning of messages deemed prophetic when making decisions concerning group life, and sometimes will publish prophecy in community newsletters. There is no formal office of prophet, but the community does have a \\"word gifts\\" group made up of members that are considered to be gifted in prophecy on a regular basis.  Gender roles  The highest office a woman can hold in the community is \\"woman leader\\" (formerly \\"handmaid\\"). Women leaders \\"teach women on womanly affairs, give advice, help in troubled situations\\" and lead specialized women's activities. The term handmaid was chosen in 1971 as a reference to Mary, the mother of Jesus, who, in most English translations of the Bible, described herself as \\"the handmaid of the Lord\\" or a woman who is close to God. The community teaches that husbands are the head of the household as well as the spiritual head of their wives. While it emphasizes traditional gender roles, the organization encourages women to pursue higher education and employment. In much of community life, men and women work together without distinction. Both men and women prophesy and exhort at community meetings, teach together in the community sponsored schools, serve together as counselors at community camps, or as members or heads of music ministries, and evangelize together in inner cities. Still, there are some significant distinctions in the roles of men and women. As noted above, women are not able to be coordinators. The community, which refers to itself as a \\"family of families,\\" sees this patriarchal tradition as following the biblical model of the family. Men and women meet separately each week in small groups called 'men's groups' or 'women's groups.' The purpose is to build deeper relationships as brothers and sisters in Christ by discussing their lives and other issues with the goal of gaining wisdom, deepening friendships, and encouraging one another to be faithful to God. Traditional roles are reinforced by encouraging men to do most of the heavier physical work involved when a family is moving to a new home or re-roofing a house, and when setting up for meetings and similar tasks. Women are encouraged to provide food and childcare and run an effective household. However, these distinctions are not absolute. For example, women have also labored side by side with men in the construction work involved in the community's Allendale outreach.Vine & Branches South Bend, IN. 2006. Divisions and affiliated organizations=Campus Division The Campus Division of the People of Praise is made up of mostly college students. Members live together in student households. Most households hold regular prayer together and often eat together. While some are not in school, most members of the Campus Division attend a variety of colleges and universities, including the University of Minnesota, IUPUI, Saint Mary's College, Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame. Members of the Campus Division consider their common life together to be part of what the People of Praise has labeled as to its city- building work. Action Division According to the organisation‚Äôs website, the Action Division consists of high school students and adults working together \\"to bring Christ's love to impoverished communities in real and tangible ways.\\"\\"Our Action program brings together high school students and adults working to bring Christ's love to impoverished communities in real and tangible ways.\\" http://www.admin.peopleofpraise.org/programs At this point, their work primarily involves outreach in a poor neighborhood called Allendale in the city of Shreveport, Louisiana. A second location has begun in inner- city Indianapolis, Indiana. However, members say that they could work in other areas in the future. The Action Division aims to \\"provide those in need with an experience of God's love for them.\\" This consists of providing jobs, affordable housing, strong families, and prayer for physical healing. Action Division members work together to \\"share all aspects of life\\" with those who are in need; these needs may be material, financial, spiritual, intellectual or social. Christians in Commerce Christians in Commerce (CIC) is a movement of business and professional men and women that is dedicated to helping members grow in the Christian life and to influence the world of commerce with the gospel. Although CIC operates independently from the People of Praise, the People of Praise helped form CIC and is actively engaged in its work. CIC is organized into over 35 local Men's Chapters, Women's Chapters and Campus Clubs. These chapters have held retreats (Challenge Weekends) that have been attended by over 14,000 men and women. Trinity Schools Trinity Schools is a group of schools founded by People of Praise which teaches middle school and high school age children. While the schools operate as an independent nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, the goals and procedures are influenced by the approach of the People of Praise. Trinity Schools provide a Classical Christian education heavily influenced by elements of Christian humanism for grades six through twelve. The schools follow an academic core curriculum which includes six years of mathematics, five years of science, 11 semesters of writing, six years of literature, and five years of a foreign language. Students also take one full year and two years of partial courses in music, drawing, and painting and two semesters of drama. The schools are ecumenical Christian. On its website Trinity School (in each of its three instances) is self-described as \\"an ecumenical Christian school witnessing to the fundamental unity of all who are baptized into Christ.\\"Trinity Schools Website, accessed March 23, 2014. Students take 5 semesters of scriptural studies (through an ecumenical Christian approach) and either a Catholic or Protestant doctrine course. Trinity Schools maintain small classes with single-sex instruction except in a few key courses such as drama, art, and foreign languages. The schools teach the theory of evolution, that marriage is only between opposite sexes, and to practice abstinence until marriage.

It is the fourth episode of the fifth season. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, after the Crystalline Entity‚Äîwhich years earlier killed the colonists of Omicron Theta‚Äîattacks another colony, Picard joins forces with scientist Kila Marr to hunt it down. Marr has been searching for the entity for years, ever since it killed her son. But Picard's determination to find a peaceful way to stop the creature's onslaught of humanity is at odds with Marr's obsession with revenge. Plot Commander Riker, Lieutenant Commander Data, and Doctor Crusher are visiting the Melona IV colony, when the Crystalline Entity appears and begins tearing up the planetary surface. Although the rapid evacuation into the caves is mostly successful, two of the colonists (including one in whom Riker expressed a possible romantic interest) die in the onslaught. The Enterprise comes to the survivors' aid and free them after the Entity leaves. The Enterprise sets out in pursuit of the Entity, with the help of Kila Marr, who is a xenobiologist and expert on the creature. Marr does not trust Data, as she is aware that Data's brother Lore has assisted the Entity in the past. Captain Picard hopes to challenge this perception by having Data work closely with Doctor Marr, in spite of Counselor Deanna Troi's worry that his suggestion will not suffice Doctor Marr's feelings of animosity. While working around the caves of Melona IV, Marr continues to show animosity towards Data. Slightly confused, Data tries to convince that he is nothing like Lore and has no affiliation with the Entity whatsoever. When he asks her what makes her think he had anything to do with the Entity, Marr reveals the source of her prejudice: her 16-year-old son was killed by the Entity at Omicron Theta, which was also Data's homeworld. She proves Data her sense of revenge and justice good by threatening that if she finds out that he is involved with the Entity as she suspects him to be, she will have him \\"disassembled piece by piece.\\" Picard tells Marr that he does not intend to kill the Entity without first attempting to communicate with it. Marr is skeptical of this approach, but she and Data work out a method for talking to the Entity. As Dr. Marr works with Data, she comes to understand that Data and Lore are quite different androids, recognizing Data's stoic yet virtuous personality and high intellect. During their research, Marr discovers Data is programmed with the memories and experiences of the Omicron Theta colony, including those of her dead son, Raymond \\"Renny\\". Data tells her about how much her son admired her work as a scientist. At Marr's request, Data reads extracts from her son's journals, in the teenager's voice, causing the emotionally moved woman to cry over hearing the sound of her dead son's voice. The Enterprise locates the Entity and begins sending a series of graviton pulses toward it. The creature responds, and emits a signal pattern which is a clear sign of intelligence. Picard is elated at a potential first contact, but Marr, in a sudden lapse of sanity, due to the long-held desire to avenge the death of her son alters the pulse to emit gravitons with a rapidly increasing amplitude, and locks the program so it cannot be stopped. The amplitude reaches a level of resonance where the Entity is shattered. Marr addresses Data as though he is her son, telling him that she destroyed the entity for him. Having finally taken her long-awaited revenge, but sacrificing her career in the process, Marr is near collapse. A disgusted Picard has Data escort Marr back to her quarters. In her quarters, Marr asks Data how long will he function, and he replies that he was programed to function for an eternity. Relieved, Marr tells Data that as long as he functions, her son is alive. Speaking to him as if he were her son, Dr. Marr pleads to Data that let \\"Renny\\" know that she destroyed the Entity for him, in the hopes that her deed will give her son's spirit a sense of peace. However, Data informs her that her son would not have approved of her destroying the Entity, stating that he loved her work as a scientist but that in her grief over his death, she destroyed the very reason why her work is so important and that he cannot help her. Reality sets in for a horrified Dr. Marr, as she silently reflects on what she has done.

Known for most of its length as Elkton Road, the highway runs from U.S. Route 40 (US 40) and MD 7 west of Elkton to the Delaware state line north of Elkton in northeastern Cecil County. At the state line, the highway continues as Delaware Route 279 (DE 279). MD 279 functions as a northern bypass of Elkton and is the primary highway to Newark, Delaware, from Maryland. The road has an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) northeast of Elkton. The state highway was originally constructed in the early 1910s. MD 279 was reconstructed and placed on a new course north of Elkton in the early 1960s. MD 279 bypassed the center of Elkton with an extension to US 40 in the late 1960s; the old alignment to downtown Elkton was designated MD 268. Route description View north along MD 279 at US 40 in Elkton MD 279 begins at an intersection with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) west of the town of Elkton. MD 7 (Philadelphia Road) heads south and west from the opposite side of the intersection. MD 279 heads northeast as two-lane divided Elkton Road, which becomes undivided before it crosses Little Elk Creek and enters the town limits of Elkton. The highway intersects MD 545 (Blue Ball Road) and curves to the east ahead of the junction with MD 213 (Bridge Street). MD 279 continues east as Newark Avenue, which has a center left-turn lane and passes between Elkton High School to the north and the adjacent Gilpin Manor Elementary School and Elkton Middle School to the south. The highway becomes Elkton Road at its intersection with the northern terminus of MD 268 (North Street), after which the route crosses Big Elk Creek, leaves the town limits of Elkton, and immediately meets the southern terminus of MD 316 (Appleton Road). MD 279 continues northeast as a four-lane divided highway. The state highway intersects Belle Hill Road, which provides access to a park and ride lot to the east of the road, before meeting I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a cloverleaf interchange and crossing Persimmon Run. MD 279 intersects the eastern terminus of MD 277 (Fletchwood Road) immediately before reaching its northern terminus at the Delaware state line. The highway continues northeast as DE 279 toward Newark. MD 279 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History MD 279 northbound past MD 213 in Elkton MD 279's original route included North Street in Elkton, what is now MD 316 from Big Elk Creek to Belle Hill Road, and Belle Hill Road to connect with the present course of the state highway. The Newark Road was planned to be built by the state but was instead constructed by Cecil County with state aid. Work on the macadam road from the Elkton town limits at Big Elk Creek to the Delaware state line was underway by 1911 and completed in 1915. This work included reconstructing the concrete arch bridge across Big Elk Creek in 1913. North Street in Elkton was paved as a concrete road by 1921. The North Street bridge across the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) was constructed between 1930 and 1934. The split segments of North Street leading to the former grade crossing of the railroad were later designated sections of MD 727. North Street was resurfaced with bituminous concrete as part of a 1950 project to resurface Elkton streets that were part of state highways. MD 279 was entirely reconstructed starting in the late 1950s. The highway's concrete arch bridge across Big Elk Creek was replaced with a prestressed concrete box girder bridge in 1958 and 1959. MD 279's present course between Big Elk Creek and Belle Hill Road was constructed and in 1959 and 1960 and surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1962. The old portion of MD 279 was replaced with a southern extension of MD 316 on Appleton Road and by MD 823 on Belle Hill Road. The highway from Belle Hill Road to the Delaware state line was reconstructed concurrent with the construction of I-95 in 1962 and 1963. Newark Avenue between MD 280 (now MD 213) and North Street was brought into the state highway system through a June 29, 1964, road transfer agreement with the county. Finally, Newark Avenue was reconstructed and the portion of MD 279 between US 40 and MD 280 was constructed between 1966 and 1968. The bypassed portion of MD 279 along North Street became MD 268. MD 279 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 316 to the Delaware state line between 1981 and 1983. The highway's junction with I-95 was originally constructed as a diamond interchange. The junction was expanded to a cloverleaf interchange between 1984 and 1993.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties, and is considered to be similar in effect to other short-acting hypnotic benzodiazepines such as triazolam or midazolam. It is used in the short-term treatment of severe insomnia. Brotizolam is a highly potent and short-acting hypnotic, with a typical dose ranging from 0.125 to 0.25 milligrams, that's rapidly eliminated with an average half-life of 4.4 hours (range 3.6‚Äì7.9 hours). It was patented in 1974US4094984 6-Phenyl-8-bromo-4H-s- triazolo-[3,4C]-thieno-[2,3E]-1,4-diazepines and salts thereof and came into medical use in 1984. Brotizolam is not approved for sale in the UK, United States or Canada. It is approved for sale in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal, Israel, Italy, Taiwan and Japan. Medical uses Brotizolam is prescribed for the short-term treatment, 2‚Äì4 weeks only of severe or debilitating insomnia. Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Brotizolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or getting to sleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis. Brotizolam, in a dose of 0.25 mg can be used as a premedication prior to surgery, this dose was found to be comparable in efficacy to 2 mg flunitrazepam as a premedicant prior to surgery. Side effects Common side effects of brotizolam are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines and are related to CNS depression, and include somnolence, ataxia, headache, anterograde amnesia, dizziness, fatigue, impairment of motor functions, slurred speech, confusion, and clumsiness. Less common side effects include hypotension, respiratory depression, hallucinations, nausea and vomiting, palpitations, and paradoxical reactions (i.e. aggression, anxiety, violent behavior, etc.). Brotizolam can cause residual side effects the next day such as impaired cognitive and motor functions as well as drowsiness. Disruption of sleep patterns may also occur such as suppression of REM sleep. These side effects are more likely at higher doses (above 0.5‚Äì1 mg). In clinical trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5 mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to nitrazepam 2.5 and 5 mg, flunitrazepam 2 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5 mg was shown to be superior to flurazepam 30 mg, but inferior to temazepam 30 mg in some studies. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5 mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25 mg. No serious side effects have been reported to date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild rebound insomnia may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped. Contraindications and special caution Thienodiazepines and benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Pharmacology Brotizolam has been shown in animal studies to be a very high potency thienodiazepine. The elimination half-life of brotizolam is 3‚Äì6 hours. It is absorbed rapidly after administration; after administration, it is metabolized into active metabolites, one of which is far less potent than brotizolam and the other is only present in very small amounts in the blood and thus the metabolites of brotizolam do not have significant pharmacological effect in humans. Brotizolam induces impairment of motor function and has hypnotic properties. Brotizolam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose- dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4, which are the deep sleep stages, when GABAergics such as brotizolam are used. Benzodiazepines and thienodiazepines are therefore not ideal hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by either may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage. Abuse Brotizolam is a drug with a potential for abuse. Drug misuse is defined as taking the drug to achieve a 'high', or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Abuse of brotizolam, although not widespread, was a problem in Hong Kong back in the late 1980s and 1990s. To control benzodiazepine abuse in Hong Kong, the Government's Pharmacy and Poisons Board reclassified benzodiazepines as Dangerous Drugs in October 1990. Apart from formal prescriptions, detailed records were then required for the supply and dispensing of these drugs. These regulations were applied initially only to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam as they were the major benzodiazepines of abuse. The impact of these regulatory changes on benzodiazepine use has been studied by analyzing the sales patterns of seven benzodiazepines between 1990‚Äì1993. In 1991, the sales of flunitrazepam and triazolam fell, but the sales of five unrestricted benzodiazepines increased. Particular problems arose with the trafficking and abuse of nimetazepam and the abuse of temazepam within that same year in 1991. The regulations that were originally only applied to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam were now being extended to include all benzodiazepines by January 1992. A regulation requiring the use of proper prescriptions and detailed records for the supply and dispensing of benzodiazepines, appears to have curbed, at least partially, their abuse in Hong Kong. There are still some problems with temazepam, nimetazepam, triazolam, and brotizolam, but they are not major.

In this system, the year is followed by . However, there is a year zero in astronomical year numbering (where it coincides with the Julian year ) and in ISO 8601:2004 (where it coincides with the Gregorian year ), as well as in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars.  Historical, astronomical and ISO year numbering systems = Historians  The Anno Domini era was introduced in 525 by Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus (c. 470‚Äìc. 544), who used it to identify the years on his Easter table. He introduced the new era to avoid using the Diocletian era, based on the accession of Roman Emperor Diocletian, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a persecutor of Christians. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the \\"present year\\" was \\"the consulship of Probus Junior [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]\\" which was also 525 years \\"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\\". How he arrived at that number is unknown. Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric Bede (c. 672‚Äì735), who used AD years in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English before Christ once, but that practice did not catch on until almost a thousand years later (when the books by Dionysius Petavius treating calendar science gained popularity). Bede did not sequentially number days of the month, weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the days of the week using a counting origin of one in Ecclesiastical Latin. Previous Christian histories used anno mundi (\\"in the year of the world\\") beginning on the first day of creation, or anno Adami (\\"in the year of Adam\\") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the Genesis creation narrative), used by Africanus, or anno Abrahami (\\"in the year of Abraham\\") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the Septuagint, used by Eusebius of Caesarea, all of which assigned \\"one\\" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era. In chapter II of book I of Ecclesiastical history, Bede stated that Julius Caesar invaded Britain \\"in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord\\", while stating in chapter III, \\"in the year of Rome 798, Claudius\\" also invaded Britain and \\"within a very few days [...] concluded the war in [...] the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord\\". Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 ‚àí 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term \\"before Christ\\" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, not a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase ante incarnationis dominicae tempus (\\"before the time of the lord's incarnation\\"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the Middle Ages. Neither the concept of nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of Roman numerals. The Babylonian system of the BC era had used the idea of \\"nothingness\\" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use Latin number words, or the word nulla (meaning \\"nothing\\") alongside Roman numerals.Faith Wallis, trans. Bede: The Reckoning of Time (725), Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004. .Byrhtferth's Enchiridion (1016). Edited by Peter S. Baker and Michael Lapidge. Early English Text Society 1995. . Zero was invented in India in the sixth century, and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century. The Arabic numeral for zero (0) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century. The anno Domini nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the to historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in Fasciculus Temporum by Werner Rolevinck in 1474, alongside years of the world (anno mundi).Werner Rolevinck, Fasciculus temporum. The terms anno Domini, Dionysian era, Christian era, vulgar era, and common era were used interchangeably between the Renaissance and the 19th century, at least in Latin. But vulgar era was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after vulgar acquired the meaning of \\"offensively coarse\\", replacing its original meaning of \\"common\\" or \\"ordinary\\". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal. Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, and , there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage anno Domini 1 is preceded by the year 1 BC, without an intervening year zero.While it is increasingly common to place AD after a date by analogy to the use of BC, formal English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year as in Latin (e.g., , but ). Neither the choice of calendar system (whether Julian or Gregorian) nor the era (Anno Domini or Common Era) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.V. Grumel, La chronologie (1958), page 30.  Astronomers  In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is ‚àí1, and so on. The letters \\"AD\\", \\"BC\\", \\"CE, or \\"BCE\\" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to ‚àí1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740. = History of astronomical usage = In 1627, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his Rudolphine Tables. He labeled the year Christi and inserted it between years labeled Ante Christum (BC) and Post Christum (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets.Tabulae Rudolphinae ‚Äì Ioannes Keplerus (1627) 191 (42), 197 (48), 203 (54), 209 (60), 215 (66), 221 (72), 227 (78). Then in 1702 the French astronomer Philippe de la Hire used a year he labeled at the end of years labeled ante Christum (BC), immediately before years labeled post Christum (AD) on the mean motion pages in his Tabul√¶ Astronomic√¶, thus adding the designation 0 to Kepler's Christi.Tabulae Astronomicae ‚Äì Philippo de la Hire (1702), Tabul√¶ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4. Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer Jacques Cassini , who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,Robert Kaplan, The nothing that is (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103. completed the transition in his Tables astronomiques, simply labeling this year 0, which he placed at the end of years labeled avant Jesus- Christ (BC), immediately before years labeled apr√®s Jesus-Christ (AD).[Jacques] Cassini, Tables astronomiques (1740), Explication et usage 5; Tables 10, 22, 53.  ISO 8601  ISO 8601:2004 (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. (Because it also specifies the use of the proleptic Gregorian calendar for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era.) The \\"basic\\" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1 BC. Several \\"expanded\\" formats are possible: ‚àí0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six- digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an absolute value one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only ISO 646 (7-bit ASCII) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a hyphen-minus. Computing Programming libraries may implement a year zero, an example being the Perl CPAN module DateTime.https://metacpan.org/pod/release/DROLSKY/DateTime-1.03/lib/DateTime.pm#Floating- DateTimes  South Asian calendars  All eras used with Hindu and Buddhist calendars, such as the Saka era or the Kali Yuga, begin with the year 0. All these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age ‚Äì people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a 24-hour clock: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, n minutes.

Edmondson (born June 10, 1959) is an American businessman, known for his career at RadioShack and his termination as CEO for falsifying his educational background.  Early life and education  David J. Edmondson was born June 10, 1959, in Methuen, Massachusetts. His mother Jeannette was a homemaker, and his adoptive father was a US soldier. Like most children of military families, Edmondson moved a great deal throughout his early life, including periods in Germany and Fort Jackson, South Carolina, before settling at Fort Carson, Colorado, in 1968, where Edmondson remained until his graduation from Alpha Omega Christian School in 1977. Edmondson moved to San Dimas, California, in 1977 where he attended Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College (PCBBC). While at Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College, Edmondson began his study to become a Baptist minister. Edmondson left California after one year on campus and returned to Colorado where he became the associate pastor of Security Baptist Temple, in Security, Colorado. He continued his studies through correspondence with PCBBC and claimed he earned his ThG (Graduate of Theology) in May 1980. Although he has attended several colleges, he does not currently hold any academic degrees.  Career  After his ordination, Edmondson relocated to Omaha, Nebraska, where he founded the Twin Cities Baptist Church. He started the church in a borrowed space donated by an Omaha businessman. In 1982, Edmondson returned to Colorado Springs and attempted to start another church. The second church was not successful and Edmondson left the full-time ministry. In 1983, Edmondson again relocated, this time to Cleveland, Ohio, and went to work for direct mail advertising company ADVO System, Inc. While serving as national account marketing executive, Edmondson worked on developing and implementing marketing programs with various divisions of Tandy Corporation, including its RadioShack Division.  RadioShack  Edmondson was recognized by Advertising Age as one of the top 100 marketers in America in 1996 for his initial repositioning of the RadioShack brand, leveraging the existing tagline \\"You‚Äôve Got Questions...

Edmondson held positions as vice president of marketing (1994‚Äì1995), senior vice president of marketing and advertising (1995‚Äì1997), executive vice president and chief operating officer (1997‚Äì2000), president and chief operating officer (2000‚Äì2005) and chief executive officer (2005-2006). = Arrests, newspaper investigation, resignation = In January 2005, shortly after RadioShack announced that Edmondson would be taking over as CEO, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated‚Äîhis third such charge‚Äîin Southlake, Texas. Edmondson pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. This incident prompted the Fort Worth Star-Telegram to begin looking more closely at his past. Edmondson resigned in February 2006, after the Star-Telegram disclosed that he had falsified his r√©sum√© and biography, claiming two non-existent college degrees.  Post-RadioShack  In 2007, Edmondson founded EasySale, an Internet-based consignment and liquidation company based in Arlington, Texas. In 2009, he co-founded and became CEO of E-Recycling Corps, (now HYLA Mobile,) an enterprise engaged in the collection, refurbishment and global redistribution of used wireless devices.

It was inspired by the true story of Susanna Willard Johnson (1730‚Äì1810) who, along with her family and younger sister, were kidnapped in an Abenakis Indian raid on Charlestown, New Hampshire in August 1754. The main events in Calico Captive, which occurred on the brink of the French and Indian War, were taken from Johnson's narrative diary A Narrative of the Captivity of Mrs. Johnson, which was first published in 1796. Calico Captive is told through the eyes of Miriam, Johnson's younger sister, and her imagined adventures. Plot summary In August 1754 Miriam Willard, along with her older sister Susanna, her husband James Johnson, and their three children; two-year-old Polly, four-year-old Susanna, and six-year-old Sylvus, are kidnapped from Number Four, a fort in Charlestown. Miriam and her family are forced to march north by their Indian captors, never knowing whether they will be killed or taken into slavery. Throughout the journey Miriam finds she cannot keep her mind off Phineas Whitney, her sweetheart planning to attend Harvard College. On the way north Susanna gives birth to a girl and names the infant Captive. The rugged trail is made far more difficult for Miriam by the miserable crying of Captive, the damp cold and hunger, and the sight of her exhausted sister. Fortunately, a horse named Scoggins is captured for Susanna so that she does not have to walk and carry the infant. Eventually the group reaches the Indian village where, upon surviving a half-hearted gauntlet while being forced to dance and sing, they are adopted into the tribe. After many months the Indian tribe‚Äôs Sachem decides to sell his English captives to the French in Montr√©al, Quebec. However, Susanna's master forces her to stay behind and Sylvanus, who has taken a liking to the Indian culture, willingly chooses to go on a hunting trip with the Indians and then stays at a different Indian village. Upon arriving in Montr√©al Miriam finds to her horror that they are all to be privately purchased off to separate owners and held on ransom. James is thrown in jail for a short time but is finally forced to retrieve money from the English governor to pay for his family‚Äôs release. Polly captures the interest of the mayor's wife, who is unable to have a child of her own, while little Susanna is sold to another French household and Miriam meets the prominent Du Quesne family. Although working as a servant, Miriam quickly finds herself living a life she has never imagined. She meets an amiable French girl named Hortense and the two quickly become friends. One day Miriam is asked by Madame Du Quesne to teach her daughter, Felicit√©, to read and write proper English. Miriam finds she is intrigued by Felicit√©‚Äôs friendliness and wealthy lifestyle. Meanwhile, James makes a petition to the French governor and is allowed to return to English territory and ask for money and a passport. Susanna is eventually released by her Indian captors and joins Miriam. Meanwhile James goes to Boston to get money in order to buy the liberty of the rest of his family. The two sisters are invited by Felicit√© to join her at a ball wherein Miriam unintentionally draws the attention of Pierre Laroche, a grandson of a wealthy nobleman. Miriam dances with the young man, which angers and embarrasses Felicit√©, who had her heart set on marrying Pierre. The Du Quesne family, feeling disgraced and insulted and because they believe James broke his bond and escaped from captivity, throws out Miriam and Susanna. After several hours in the snowy streets Hortense finds the two and informs them they can stay with her family. Miriam realizes that the Hortense family cannot support three more occupants and conjures a plan to make some money. She decides to use her talent for dressmaking to craft a fashionable dress for Madame Du Quesne and Felicit√©. The plan works, although she is told to keep her services a secret. However, the governor‚Äôs wife, Marquise De Vaundreuil, finds out Miriam had designed the Du Quesne dresses and hires her. When James finally returns the French governor has been replaced. The new authority refuses to recognize the agreement. Worse yet, Polly, who was unable to adjust to her new family, runs away and is eventually allowed to stay with her mother. Instead of earning their freedom Susanna, James, Polly and Captive are thrown in jail. Miriam, as a dressmaker for a notable family, is spared jail time. Miriam eventually succeeds in gathering her courage and asks Marquise De Vaundreuil about her relatives. Marquise De Vaundreuil promises she will talk with her husband. Meanwhile, Pierre asks Miriam to marry him although, after much consideration, she realizes she truly does not love him. Marquise De Vaundreuil keeps her promise to speak with her husband and eventually Miriam, Susanna, James, Polly and Captive are released from prison. They board a small sailing vessel to cross the Atlantic to Plymouth, England and from there they sail back to America, finally as free people. Two years later Sylvanus is brought home by a redeemed Indian captive. Another redeemed prisoner from Montr√©al brings home little Susanna. Phineas Whitney, after graduating from Harvard, marries Miriam.

Starring Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara and George Sanders, the film is set in the midst of World War II in an unspecified place in German-occupied Europe that appears similar to France. Laughton plays Albert Lory, a cowardly school teacher in a town \\"somewhere in Europe\\" (according to the film's title sequence) who is drawn into advocating resistance through his love of his country and of his fellow teacher Louise Martin, portrayed by O'Hara. The film is one of the more acclaimed of the war films of the era. It won the 1944 Academy Award for Best Sound Recording (Stephen Dunn). Having opened simultaneously in 72 theaters, the film set a record for gross receipts on an opening day upon its release on May 7, 1943. Plot Albert is an unmarried schoolmaster living with his dominating mother and secretly in love with his neighbour and fellow teacher Louise. Widely regarded as ineffectual, he embarrasses everybody by his panic during an Allied air raid. Louise is however engaged to George, the head of the railway yard, who like many in the town believes that collaboration with the German occupation is the only logical course. Her brother Paul, who works in the yard, is an active resister and, trying to kill the German commandant Major von Keller with a grenade, instead kills two German soldiers. After turning a blind eye to previous acts of resistance (such as a wrecked train) in the hope of preserving good relations with the town, von Keller must now act and takes 10 local hostages, saying they will be shot in a week if the guilty person who threw the grenade is not found. Albert's mother, jealous of Louise, tells George that it was Paul. George tells von Keller and then, in a crisis of conscience, shoots himself. Albert bursts in a minute later, furious at discovering his mother's treachery, and is found with George's corpse and gun. Regarding it as a matter for the civilian courts, the Germans expect Albert to be condemned. When in his defence he starts an impassioned plea for resistance, the prosecutor requests an adjournment. That night, von Keller comes to his cell and offers a deal: If he will keep quiet next day, new forged evidence will acquit him. To emphasize the point, in the morning the 10 hostages (including his friend Professor Sorel) are shot beneath his window. Back in court, Albert is all the more eloquent in the cause of liberty and the jurors proclaim him innocent. Freed and back in his schoolroom, with a proud Louise by his side, he is reading to the boys the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen when German soldiers come to take him away.Reel Men at War: Masculinity and the American War Film.

Lorraine Themes Though the prime purpose of the film is propaganda to strengthen Allied resolve in the fight against Nazism, critics at the time and since have noted that Nichols and Renoir adopt a distinctively nuanced approach. The Germans, with von Keller an eloquent advocate of the advantages for Europe of Nazi rule, are not shown as mere brutes. Nor are the French, apart from the few mental or physical resisters, shown as heroes battling tyranny. Instead, some readings suggest that, as in Renoir's previous films La Grande Illusion and La R√®gle du Jeu, class may be more significant than race or nationality. For example, James Morrison cites how the film blames the bourgeoisie, a few left-wing intellectuals excepted, for letting Hitler into power in 1933, for surrendering France in 1940 and for collaborating actively or passively. This stance was confirmed by Renoir shortly after the film came out when, in a speech, he asserted that his recent films \\"breathed this breath of anti-Fascism\\" and were rooted in the experience of the Popular Front of 1936, which was \\"a magnificent exposition of human brotherhood\\". Reception In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

Dodd rose from the so-called First Chicago School of architecture, though of greater influence for his mature designs was the classical aesthetic of the Beaux-Arts style ascendant after the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. His design work also included functional and decorative architectural glass and ceramics, furniture, home appliances, and literary illustration. In a prodigious career lasting more than 40 years, Dodd left many extant structures on both east and west coasts and in the midwest and upper south, among the best known of these being the original Presbyterian Seminary campus (now Jefferson Community & Technical College), the Weissinger-Gaulbert Apartments, and the old YMCA building, all three in downtown Louisville. Also notable are his numerous residential and ecclesiastical designs still in use in Kentucky and Tennessee. In California, examples of his extant work include the Pacific Center and Hearst's Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Building in downtown Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse south of Pasadena.

The archives of the Institute do not yet support this claim.Research offers a possible explanation for this biographical uncertainty; Dodd may have received his earliest technical training under the auspices of the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts (1879‚Äì1882), the immediate predecessor to the Art Institute; the academy boasted an architecture and design curriculum.

It now broadcasts for Cincinnati's Catholic community and archdiocesan base and is an affiliate of EWTN radio for most (if not all) of its programming. WNOP was a jazz station for 38 years, except for a brief run as a CNN Headline News affiliate from 1992 to 1994. Cincinnati.com July 28, 2008 - \\"WNOP has seen it all\\" http://nky.cincinnati.com/article/AB/20080728/NEWS0103/111110002/WNOP-has- seen-it-all accessed March 26, 2010 WNOP's current religious talk format started on December 31, 2000, History=Startup The station was first on the air with a combined Country Music and pre-recorded radio shows, receiving its Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license on May 29, 1947. The first broadcasts were on August 21, 1948. Jimmie Skinner hosted a radio program, which featured singer Connie Hall. Jazz era (1962‚Äì2000) Despite its relatively weak signal (not to mention almost bumping right into AM powerhouse WLW), WNOP had a core audience of loyal listeners during the years when its musical programming was mostly jazz. Its studios were on Monmouth St., in Newport KY and before the Jazz Ark, Ty Williams bravely played music during a studio fire. From there they moved to the floating studios on the Ohio river. It wasn't all jazz, however‚Äîsometimes, breaks between songs were filled with recordings of stand-up comedians. For the favorite comedy cuts the punch lines would be saved to a Gates ST-101 Spot Tape machine. They could be played as the DJ felt appropriate anytime between music tracks, or commercial VO. From Monmouth St. the station moved to studios that were a tiny floating facility on the Ohio River, called \\"the jazz ark.\\" Likewise, it had an on-air irreverence that could jolt you without warning. For instance, it sometimes identified itself as being \\"just a little to the right of WLW,\\" while at other times, it claimed to be \\"Radio Free Newport.\\" On winter days when Cincinnati was hit with large amounts of snow and most stations announced school and workplace closings, morning on-air personality Leo Underhill instead would inform listeners which bars were closed due to bad weather. \\"Dick Pike jazzed up radio's small, but legendary, WNOP\\" Sacred Heart Radio (2000‚Äìpresent) Sacred Heart Radio assumed ownership of the station on January 1, 2001. The program format was changed from Jazz to religious talk radio....much of it coming from EWTN Global Catholic Radio. The last song played before the switch was \\"The Vatican Rag\\" by Tom Lehrer. The Son Rise Morning Show which airs weekday mornings on EWTN Radio originates from WNOP's studios which are now located at Our Lady of the Holy Spirit Center (the former St. Gregory's Seminary) at 5440 Moeller Avenue in Norwood. On August 24, 2010 WHSS, 89.5 MHz in Hamilton, was sold by the Hamilton City Schools to Sacred Heart Radio. It is now an FM repeater of WNOP reaching the northern Cincinnati region of Hamilton, Middletown, Mason and the surrounding area. In April 2016 Sacred Heart Radio Inc. purchased WPFB, 910 AM in Middletown from Northern Kentucky University to serve Middletown and the Dayton area.

(Global Genocide Forget Heaven) is an American industrial music band from Oakland, California, United States. The band's musical inspiration derives from lyrical concepts such as death, murder, religion, drug abuse, rape, sex, and mental illness.} They have received critical acclaim from Kerrang! and Terrorizer magazines.  History  Michael Geist, also known as Ghost or DJ Ghost, formed G.G.F.H. in 1986, although he had been creating music since 1984. Their moniker originally stood for Goat Guys from Hell or Gore Gods From Hell, but Ghost finally settled on Global Genocide Forget Heaven. After releasing seven demo tapes and playing the occasional live show, Brian J. Walls joined the band and the duo were eventually signed to Peaceville Records' then new subsidiary label for experimental bands, Dreamtime, in 1991. Their first official release was Eclipse, which was used to help launch the new subsidiary label. This was followed a year later by the EP, \\"Reality\\". 1993 saw the release of the Disease album, which took a more techno direction than their previous releases. G.G.F.H. toured Europe briefly supporting metal bands such as Fear Factory and My Dying Bride. Their shows were memorable for the TVs on the stage flickering images of war, porn and autopsy footage. Ghost would have a bucket of fake blood which he would dip a Little Missy doll into and then flick around the front of the stage onto the audience. When the band was supposed to tour with My Dying Bride, Ghost was arrested at the airport for carrying illegal goods in his luggage, namely various stage props. Loz, who was a roadie for G.G.F.H., had to take over vocal duties, and at one point he was on his own as Brian J. Walls had been hospitalized. Ghost also made a guest appearance on My Dying Bride's I Am the Bloody Earth EP in 1994, a year which also saw the release of Halloween, a compilation of early demo tracks, and the limited edition, green vinyl single, \\"Welcome to the Process/Too Much Punch\\". A year later, Brian J. Walls left the band to pursue other interests including web design and the contract with Peaceville Records had expired. Over the next 10 years, Ghost started a graphic design company and gained notoriety as a DJ in various parts of America, and G.G.F.H. was put on hold. However, after the release of The Very Beast of G.G.F.H. Vol. 1 in 2001, Ghost decided to write new G.G.F.H. material. With the absence of Brian J. Walls, the band's main songwriter, Ghost looked to a handful of contributors to help write it. Their latest album, titled Serrated Smile, was released in 2005.

This is intended to enhance biological productivity and/or accelerate carbon dioxide () sequestration from the atmosphere. Iron is a trace element necessary for photosynthesis in plants. It is highly insoluble in sea water and in a variety of locations is the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth. Large algal blooms can be created by supplying iron to iron-deficient ocean waters. These blooms can nourish other organisms. Multiple ocean labs, scientists and businesses have explored fertilization. Beginning in 1993, thirteen research teams completed ocean trials demonstrating that phytoplankton blooms can be stimulated by iron augmentation. Controversy remains over the effectiveness of atmospheric sequestration and ecological effects. The most recent open ocean trials of ocean iron fertilization were in 2009 (January to March) in the South Atlantic by project Lohafex, and in July 2012 in the North Pacific off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, by the Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation (HSRC). Fertilization occurs naturally when upwellings bring nutrient-rich water to the surface, as occurs when ocean currents meet an ocean bank or a sea mount. This form of fertilization produces the world's largest marine habitats. Fertilization can also occur when weather carries wind blown dust long distances over the ocean, or iron-rich minerals are carried into the ocean by glaciers, rivers and icebergs. History Consideration of iron's importance to phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis dates to the 1930s when English biologist Joseph Hart speculated that the ocean's great \\"desolate zones\\" (areas apparently rich in nutrients, but lacking in plankton activity or other sea life) might be iron-deficient. Little scientific discussion was recorded until the 1980s, when oceanographer John Martin of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories renewed controversy on the topic with his marine water nutrient analyses. His studies supported Hart's hypothesis. These \\"desolate\\" regions came to be called \\"High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll\\" (HNLC) zones. John Gribbin was the first scientist to publicly suggest that climate change could be reduced by adding large amounts of soluble iron to the oceans. Martin's 1988 quip four months later at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, \\"Give me a half a tanker of iron and I will give you another ice age,\\" drove a decade of research. The findings suggested that iron deficiency was limiting ocean productivity and offered an approach to mitigating climate change as well. Perhaps the most dramatic support for Martin's hypothesis came with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. Environmental scientist Andrew Watson analyzed global data from that eruption and calculated that it deposited approximately 40,000 tons of iron dust into oceans worldwide. This single fertilization event preceded an easily observed global decline in atmospheric and a parallel pulsed increase in oxygen levels. The parties to the London Dumping Convention adopted a non-binding resolution in 2008 on fertilization (labeled LC-LP.1(2008)). The resolution states that ocean fertilization activities, other than legitimate scientific research, \\"should be considered as contrary to the aims of the Convention and Protocol and do not currently qualify for any exemption from the definition of dumping\\". An Assessment Framework for Scientific Research Involving Ocean Fertilization, regulating the dumping of wastes at sea (labeled LC-LP.2(2010)) was adopted by the Contracting Parties to the Convention in October 2010 (LC 32/LP 5). Methods There are two ways of performing artificial iron fertilization: ship based direct into the ocean and atmospheric deployment. Ship based deployment Trials of ocean fertilization using iron sulphate added directly to the surface water from ships are described in detail in the experiment section below. Atmospheric sourcing Iron-rich dust rising into the atmosphere is a primary source of ocean iron fertilization. For example, wind blown dust from the Sahara desert fertilizes the Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon rainforest. The naturally occurring iron oxide in atmospheric dust reacts with hydrogen chloride from sea spray to produce iron chloride, which degrades methane and other greenhouse gases, brightens clouds and eventually falls with the rain in low concentration across a wide area of the globe. Unlike ship based deployment, no trials have been performed of increasing the natural level of atmospheric iron. Expanding this atmospheric source of iron could complement ship-based deployment. One proposal is to boost the atmospheric iron level with Iron salt aerosol. Iron(III) chloride added to the troposphere could increase natural cooling effects including methane removal, cloud brightening and ocean fertilization, helping to prevent or reverse global warming. Experiments Martin hypothesized that increasing phytoplankton photosynthesis could slow or even reverse global warming by sequestering in the sea. He died shortly thereafter during preparations for Ironex I, a proof of concept research voyage, which was successfully carried out near the Galapagos Islands in 1993 by his colleagues at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Thereafter 12 international ocean studies examined the phenomenon: * Ironex II, 1995Ironex II , 1995 * SOIREE (Southern Ocean Iron Release Experiment), 1999SOIREE (Southern Ocean Iron Release Experiment) , 1999 * EisenEx (Iron Experiment), 2000EisenEx (Iron Experiment) , 2000 * SEEDS (Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study), 2001SEEDS (Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study) , 2001 * SOFeX (Southern Ocean Iron Experiments - North & South), 2002SOFeX (Southern Ocean Iron Experiments - North & South), 2002 * SERIES (Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study), 2002SERIES (Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study), 2002 * SEEDS-II, 2004SEEDS-II, 2004 * EIFEX (European Iron Fertilization Experiment),EIFEX (European Iron Fertilization Experiment) , 2004 A successful experiment conducted in 2004 in a mesoscale ocean eddy in the South Atlantic resulted in a bloom of diatoms, a large portion of which died and sank to the ocean floor when fertilization ended. In contrast to the LOHAFEX experiment, also conducted in a mesoscale eddy, the ocean in the selected area contained enough dissolved silicon for the diatoms to flourish.

The experiment was carried out in waters low in silicic acid, an essential nutrient for diatom growth. This affected sequestration efficacy. A portion of the southwest Atlantic was fertilized with iron sulfate. A large phytoplankton bloom was triggered. In the absence of diatoms, a relatively small amount of carbon was sequestered, because other phytoplankton are vulnerable to predation by zooplankton and do not sink rapidly upon death. These poor sequestration results led to suggestions that fertilization is not an effective carbon mitigation strategy in general. However, prior ocean fertilization experiments in high silica locations revealed much higher carbon sequestration rates because of diatom growth. LOHAFEX confirmed sequestration potential depends strongly upon appropriate siting. * Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation (HSRC), 2012 - funded by the Old Massett Haida band and managed by Russ George - dumped 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific into an eddy west of the islands of Haida Gwaii. This resulted in increased algae growth over . Critics alleged George's actions violated the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the London convention on the dumping of wastes at sea which prohibited such geoengineering experiments. On 15 July 2014, the resulting scientific data was made available to the public. Science The maximum possible result from iron fertilization, assuming the most favourable conditions and disregarding practical considerations, is 0.29W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, offsetting 1/6 of current levels of anthropogenic emissions. These benefits have been called into question by research suggesting that fertilization with iron may deplete other essential nutrients in the seawater causing reduced phytoplankton growth elsewhere -- in other words, that iron concentrations limit growth more locally than they do on a global scale. Role of iron About 70% of the world's surface is covered in oceans. The part of these where light can penetrate is inhabited by algae (and other marine life). In some oceans, algae growth and reproduction is limited by the amount of iron. Iron is a vital micronutrient for phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis that has historically been delivered to the pelagic sea by dust storms from arid lands. This Aeolian dust contains 3‚Äì5% iron and its deposition has fallen nearly 25% in recent decades.Ocean Plant Life Slows Down and Absorbs less Carbon NASA Earth Observatory The Redfield ratio describes the relative atomic concentrations of critical nutrients in plankton biomass and is conventionally written \\"106 C: 16 N: 1 P.\\" This expresses the fact that one atom of phosphorus and 16 of nitrogen are required to \\"fix\\" 106 carbon atoms (or 106 molecules of ). Research expanded this constant to \\"106 C: 16 N: 1 P: .001 Fe\\" signifying that in iron deficient conditions each atom of iron can fix 106,000 atoms of carbon, or on a mass basis, each kilogram of iron can fix 83,000 kg of carbon dioxide. The 2004 EIFEX experiment reported a carbon dioxide to iron export ratio of nearly 3000 to 1. The atomic ratio would be approximately: \\"3000 C: 58,000 N: 3,600 P: 1 Fe\\". Therefore, small amounts of iron (measured by mass parts per trillion) in HNLC zones can trigger large phytoplankton blooms on the order of 100,000 kilograms of plankton per kilogram of iron. The size of the iron particles is critical. Particles of 0.5‚Äì1 micrometer or less seem to be ideal both in terms of sink rate and bioavailability. Particles this small are easier for cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton to incorporate and the churning of surface waters keeps them in the euphotic or sunlit biologically active depths without sinking for long periods. Atmospheric deposition is an important iron source. Satellite images and data (such as PODLER, MODIS, MSIR) combined with back-trajectory analyses identified natural sources of iron‚Äìcontaining dust. Iron-bearing dusts erode from soil and are transported by wind. Although most dust sources are situated in the Northern Hemisphere, the largest dust sources are located in northern and southern Africa, North America, central Asia and Australia. Heterogeneous chemical reactions in the atmosphere modify the speciation of iron in dust and may affect the bioavailability of deposited iron. The soluble form of iron is much higher in aerosols than in soil (~0.5%). Several photo-chemical interactions with dissolved organic acids increase iron solubility in aerosols. Among these, photochemical reduction of oxalate-bound Fe(III) from iron-containing minerals is important. The organic ligand forms a surface complex with the Fe (III) metal center of an iron-containing mineral (such as hematite or goethite). On exposure to solar radiation the complex is converted to an excited energy state in which the ligand, acting as bridge and an electron donor, supplies an electron to Fe(III) producing soluble Fe(II). Consistent with this, studies documented a distinct diel variation in the concentrations of Fe (II) and Fe(III) in which daytime Fe(II) concentrations exceed those of Fe(III).  Volcanic ash as an iron source  Volcanic ash has a significant role in supplying the world's oceans with iron. Volcanic ash is composed of glass shards, pyrogenic minerals, lithic particles and other forms of ash that release nutrients at different rates depending on structure and the type of reaction caused by contact with water. Increases of biogenic opal in the sediment record are associated with increased iron accumulation over the last million years. In August 2008, an eruption in the Aleutian Islands deposited ash in the nutrient-limited Northeast Pacific. This ash and iron deposition resulted in one of the largest phytoplankton blooms observed in the subarctic. Carbon sequestration Air-sea exchange of Previous instances of biological carbon sequestration triggered major climatic changes, lowering the temperature of the planet, such as the Azolla event. Plankton that generate calcium or silicon carbonate skeletons, such as diatoms, coccolithophores and foraminifera, account for most direct sequestration. When these organisms die their carbonate skeletons sink relatively quickly and form a major component of the carbon-rich deep sea precipitation known as marine snow. Marine snow also includes fish fecal pellets and other organic detritus, and steadily falls thousands of meters below active plankton blooms. Of the carbon-rich biomass generated by plankton blooms, half (or more) is generally consumed by grazing organisms (zooplankton, krill, small fish, etc.) but 20 to 30% sinks below into the colder water strata below the thermocline. Much of this fixed carbon continues into the abyss, but a substantial percentage is redissolved and remineralized. At this depth, however, this carbon is now suspended in deep currents and effectively isolated from the atmosphere for centuries. (The surface to benthic cycling time for the ocean is approximately 4,000 years.) =Analysis and quantification= Evaluation of the biological effects and verification of the amount of carbon actually sequestered by any particular bloom involves a variety of measurements, combining ship-borne and remote sampling, submarine filtration traps, tracking buoy spectroscopy and satellite telemetry. Unpredictable ocean currents can remove experimental iron patches from the pelagic zone, invalidating the experiment. The potential of fertilization to tackle global warming is illustrated by the following figures. If phytoplankton converted all the nitrate and phosphate present in the surface mixed layer across the entire Antarctic circumpolar current into organic carbon, the resulting carbon dioxide deficit could be compensated by uptake from the atmosphere amounting to about 0.8 to 1.4 gigatonnes of carbon per year. This quantity is comparable in magnitude to annual anthropogenic fossil fuels combustion of approximately 6 gigatonnes. The Antarctic circumpolar current region is one of several in which iron fertilization could be conducted--the Galapagos islands area another potentially suitable location. Dimethyl sulfide and clouds Schematic diagram of the CLAW hypothesis (Charlson et al., 1987) Some species of plankton produce dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a portion of which enters the atmosphere where it is oxidized by hydroxyl radicals (OH), atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine monoxide (BrO) to form sulfate particles, and potentially increase cloud cover. This may increase the albedo of the planet and so cause cooling‚Äîthis proposed mechanism is central to the CLAW hypothesis. This is one of the examples used by James Lovelock to illustrate his Gaia hypothesis. During SOFeX, DMS concentrations increased by a factor of four inside the fertilized patch. Widescale iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean could lead to significant sulfur-triggered cooling in addition to that due to the uptake and that due to the ocean's albedo increase, however the amount of cooling by this particular effect is very uncertain. Financial opportunities Beginning with the Kyoto Protocol, several countries and the European Union established carbon offset markets which trade certified emission reduction credits (CERs) and other types of carbon credit instruments. In 2007 CERs sold for approximately ‚Ç¨15‚Äì20/ton .Feb 2007 Carbon Update, CO2 Australia Iron fertilization is relatively inexpensive compared to scrubbing, direct injection and other industrial approaches, and can theoretically sequester for less than ‚Ç¨5/ton , creating a substantial return. In August, 2010, Russia established a minimum price of ‚Ç¨10/ton for offsets to reduce uncertainty for offset providers. Scientists have reported a 6‚Äì12% decline in global plankton production since 1980.Plankton Found to Absorb Less Carbon Dioxide BBC, 8/30/06 A full-scale plankton restoration program could regenerate approximately 3‚Äì5 billion tons of sequestration capacity worth ‚Ç¨50-100 billion in carbon offset value. However, a 2013 study indicates the cost versus benefits of iron fertilization puts it behind carbon capture and storage and carbon taxes.Iron fertilisation sunk as an ocean carbon storage solution University of Sydney press release 12 December 2012 and Harrison, D P IJGW (2013) Sequestration definitions Carbon is not considered \\"sequestered\\" unless it settles to the ocean floor where it may remain for millions of years. Most of the carbon that sinks beneath plankton blooms is dissolved and remineralized well above the seafloor and eventually (days to centuries) returns to the atmosphere, negating the original benefit. Advocates argue that modern climate scientists and Kyoto Protocol policy makers define sequestration over much shorter time frames. For example, trees and grasslands are viewed as important carbon sinks. Forest biomass sequesters carbon for decades, but carbon that sinks below the marine thermocline (100‚Äì200 meters) is removed from the atmosphere for hundreds of years, whether it is remineralized or not. Since deep ocean currents take so long to resurface, their carbon content is effectively sequestered by the criterion in use today. Debate While ocean iron fertilization could represent a potent means to slow global warming current debate raises a variety of concerns. Precautionary principle The precautionary principle (PP) states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm, in the absence of scientific consensus, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those who would take the action. The side effects of large-scale iron fertilization are not yet quantified. Creating phytoplankton blooms in iron- poor areas is like watering the desert: in effect it changes one type of ecosystem into another. The argument can be applied in reverse, by considering emissions to be the action and remediation an attempt to partially offset the damage. Fertilization advocates respond that algal blooms have occurred naturally for millions of years with no observed ill effects. The Azolla event occurred around 49 million years ago and accomplished what fertilization is intended to achieve (but on a larger scale).  20th-century phytoplankton decline  While advocates argue that iron addition would help to reverse a supposed decline in phytoplankton, this decline may not be real. One study reported a decline in ocean productivity comparing the 1979‚Äì1986 and 1997‚Äì2000 periods, but two others found increases in phytoplankton.(Antoine et al.., 2005)Gregg et al.. 2005 A 2010 study of oceanic transparency since 1899 and in situ chlorophyll measurements concluded that oceanic phytoplankton medians decreased by ~1% per year over that century. Ecological issuesAlgal blooms= A \\"red tide\\" off the coast of La Jolla, San Diego, California. Critics are concerned that fertilization will create harmful algal blooms (HAB). The species that respond most strongly to fertilization vary by location and other factors and could possibly include species that cause red tides and other toxic phenomena. These factors affect only near-shore waters, although they show that increased phytoplankton populations are not universally benign. Most species of phytoplankton are harmless or beneficial, given that they constitute the base of the marine food chain. Fertilization increases phytoplankton only in the open oceans (far from shore) where iron deficiency is substantial. Most coastal waters are replete with iron and adding more has no useful effect. A 2010 study of iron fertilization in an oceanic high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll environment, however, found that fertilized Pseudo-nitzschia diatom spp., which are generally nontoxic in the open ocean, began producing toxic levels of domoic acid. Even short-lived blooms containing such toxins could have detrimental effects on marine food webs. =Ecosystem effects= Depending upon the composition and timing of delivery, iron infusions could preferentially favor certain species and alter surface ecosystems to unknown effect. Population explosions of jellyfish, which disturb the food chain impacting whale populations or fisheries, are unlikely as iron fertilization experiments are conducted in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll waters that favor the growth of larger diatoms over small flagellates. This has been shown to lead to increased abundance of fish and whales over jellyfish. A 2010 study showed that iron enrichment stimulates toxic diatom production in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll areas which, the authors argue, raises \\"serious concerns over the net benefit and sustainability of large-scale iron fertilizations\\". Nitrogen released by cetaceans and iron chelate are a significant benefit to the marine food chain in addition to sequestering carbon for long periods of time. = Ocean acidification = A 2009 study tested the potential of iron fertilization to reduce both atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidity using a global ocean carbon model. The study showed that an optimized regime of micronutrient introduction would reduce the predicted increase of atmospheric CO2 by more than 20 percent. Unfortunately, the impact on ocean acidification would be split, with a decrease in acidification in surface waters but an increase in acidification in the deep ocean.

V. Haley is an American author and academic, currently W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair of International Business and Professor of Management at the W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State University in the U.S. state of Kansas. Prior to this, she was at other universities including West Virginia University, Massey University in New Zealand and at Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University. Haley is credited with providing the intellectual foundations on understanding subsidies to Chinese industry with her book of the same name and testimonies, used as a basis for the current trade wars. See http://ushahaley.academia.edu. Born in Mumbai, India, she received a bachelor's degree in Politics at Elphinstone College, Mumbai and then went on to get graduate degrees from various American universities including a Master's from University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in Political Science, and New York University, where she received Master's and PhD degrees in International Business and Strategy from the Stern School of Business. Besides the US, Dr. Haley has lived and worked in Mexico, Singapore, Australia, China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Italy, Finland, Russia, New Zealand and several other countries. Research An expert on Asian and Emerging Markets, Dr. Haley's extensive research includes over 200 articles and presentations and 6 books that explore companies and business environments in India, China, Southeast Asia and Mexico. Her research on Subsidies to Chinese Industry has supported trade regulation in the United States and the European Union. She has also studied the effects of sanctions and trade barriers such as subsidies on the behaviors of companies and nations. Her research on boycotts, divestitures and regulations published in Multinational Corporations in Political Environments concluded that most sanctions had no effect on US corporate behaviors in South Africa. Her book, The Chinese Tao of Business highlighted the Chinese business environment and how companies operate there to enhance their profits. Her book New Asian Emperors analyzed business information for strategic decisions in Southeast Asia and the influence of networks. She is a frequent public speaker and expert on the talk and press circuit. Her research has been regularly profiled in the major media including the Wall Street Journal, (\\"U.S. Researcher Usha C.V. Haley's Study on Chinese Subsidies to its Glass Industry\\", Aug 30, 2010) The Economist (\\"Survey of Asian Business\\", April 7‚Äì13, 2001), CNN (\\"Special Report: Eye on China,\\" May 18‚Äì19, 2005), Bloomberg News (\\"China Steel Makers get $27 Billion Subsidy,\\" January 8, 2008), Barron's Magazine (\\"Foreign Carmakers keep up the Pressure on Detroit,\\" October 22, 2001), USA Today (\\"Tech Start-Ups Don't Grow on Trees Outside USA\\", June 28, 2006) the Wall Street Journal (\\"Could the Asian Crises Repeat?\\", July 3, 2007), The New York Times, (\\"With New Urgency US and South Korea Seek Free Trade Deal\\", January 16, 2007) and BusinessWeek (\\"The Art of Chinese Relationships\\", January 6, 2006). Activities In August 2012, Usha Haley received the Academy of Management's Practice Impact Award for influential research with impact. The Academy of Management is the largest and oldest scholarly association in Management in the world. In September 2011, Usha Haley delivered a Thought Leader presentation on business and government relations in China at the Economist's flagship High Growth Market Summit in London. Dr. Haley has received a life-time award from academic publisher Emerald for her contributions to the understanding of Business in the Asia- Pacific and serves on several corporate and governmental boards as well as academic journal editorial boards. Haley has also testified numerous times before US Congress on her research on China, subsidies, emerging and transitional economies. Included in these testimonies, in July 2013 Haley served as witness in the United States Senate hearing on Smithfield and beyond: Examining foreign purchases of American food companies. Citing food- safety violations, senior managers' connections to the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government competitive stances, Chinese subsidies and research on Chinese strategy, Haley advocated against the takeover of Virginia-based Smithfield Foods by Chinese company Shuanghui on national-security grounds. In April 2006 she testified before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission on the effects of Chinese government subsidies on US business operations in China. In March 2007, she testified before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means in support of the ground-breaking, US federal trade legislation, The Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2007. She has also presented her research on China before the U.S. International Trade Commission, the United States Trade Representative and the United States Department of Commerce. Dr. Haley's research on Chinese subsidies to its domestic industry and China's business environment has provided support for US federal investigations and legislation on emerging markets as well as in anti- dumping litigation in the European Union and the USA. Her work on Chinese steel subsidies has been used in trade regulation in the European Union and Germany. Responding to her research findings and to other testimony from business, on June 20, 2008, U.S. steel pipe manufacturers, who have been battling a surge in imports from China, won a major victory when the International Trade Commission cleared the way for the imposition of stiff penalty tariffs for the next five years. The commission voted 5-0 that the U.S. industry was being harmed by the import of circular steel pipe from China. The decision marked the first time a U.S. industry has won a decision to impose tariffs on a Chinese product based on the argument that the Chinese government was unfairly subsidizing a Chinese industry. The ruling means penalty tariffs ranging from 99 percent to 701 percent will be imposed on Chinese imports of circular welded pipe. For more than two decades, the U.S. government had refused to consider subsidy cases against the Chinese government because China was classified as a non-market economy. However, the Bush administration, facing increasing anger over soaring trade deficits with China, reversed course in late 2007 and announced it would treat China in the same way as other countries in disputes involving government subsidies (\\"US Steel Industry Wins Trade Case against China\\", Associated Press, June 20, 2008). In October 2009, at the request of 8 US senators from Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Louisiana, her research on subsidies to China's industry was used by the US government to question Chinese trade and production practices in the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), th major venue for business and trade negotiations between the two countries. In addition to Senator Casey, the letter requesting the inclusion of her research in the US-China negotiations was also signed by Senator Charles Schumer (NY), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), Senator Arlen Specter (PA), Senator Sherrod Brown (OH), Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), Senator Evan Bayh (IN) and Senator Mary Landrieu (LA). In July 2010, drawing on her research on China's paper industry, 104 US Senators and Representatives wrote a bi-partisan letter to President Obama recommending action on China trade. In January 2012, her research on subsidies to Chinese auto parts became part of a congressional effort to demand an inquiry into Chinese auto-parts production and effects on US jobs. The bi-partisan effort is led by Senator Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Senator Debbie Stabenow (Michigan), industry groups and think tanks. In 2012, her research on the evolution of the global energy industry has supported the Obama administration's and industry groups' successful levying of tariffs on Chinese solar panel imports into the USA.

He was first elected to the city's council in 1986. Following the death of Mayor Lorna Jackson in 2002, Di Biase was appointed acting mayor by virtue of his position as senior regional councillor (a position he had held since 1988). In the 2003 municipal election, Di Biase won his first official term as mayor. He became the first chairman of the Vaughan Health Care Foundation, an independent non-profit organization established by the city of Vaughan on 16 January 2004 to \\"bring a hospital and ancillary services\\" to the city. The Globe and Mail newspaper reports that Di Biase received an annual salary of $164,074, making him one of the highest-paid municipal politicians in the country. The next highest paid mayor was Hazel McCallion of Mississauga at $158,704. The mayor of the largest city in Canada, David Miller of Toronto, received $143,635 per year. The average salary of Vaughan councillors was $102,657 which is second to that of Mississauga at $113,296, while Toronto councillors earn $85,497. In the 2006 municipal election, Di Biase faced Lorna Jackson's daughter Linda Jackson and lost by 90 votes in one of the closest races of the night. After a court-ordered recount completed on April 26, 2007, which had been initiated by Di Biase, it was confirmed that Jackson had indeed won the election. In 2006, Di Biase was made a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Government of Italy. In September 2009, after an audit of Di Biase's campaign in Vaughan's 2006 municipal election, he had faced 27 charges in contravention of the Municipal Elections Act, including alleged election finance irregularities. He was elected Local and Regional Councillor for the City of Vaughan in October 2010. His term began December 1, 2010. In July 2011, an auditing committee voted to examine expenses relating to Di Biase's 2010 campaign. It is alleged that due to improper reporting and accounting procedures on DiBiase's part, he improperly kept $32,000 in campaign funds that should have been returned to the city. In April 2015, Di Biase was docked three month's pay for breaching the city's code of conduct by aiding a local construction firm acquire municipal contracts.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaughan-s-michael-di-biase- should-lose-3-months-pay-ethics-czar-says-1.3038701 On May 18, 2017 Di Biase resigned as regional councillor and deputy mayor stemming from sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations made by a city staffer.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaughan-deputy-mayor-resigns-in- midst-of-sexual-assault-and-harassment-scandal-1.4121845 In October 2019, Di Biase was charged with one charge each of breach of trust and municipal corruption under the criminal code. In February 2020, the two criminal code charges were dropped, but Di Biase pleaded guilty and was convicted of a Municipal Act, 2001 offence; he was charged $5,000 and donated $20,000 to two Vaughan charities as part of the agreement.

It is located in the campus of Dhaka University, just in front of the Faculty of Arts Building. In Bengali, the phrase means \\"Unvanquished Bengal\\".  History  The sculpture work was started at the end of 1973 based on sculptor Syed Abdullah Khalid's design and superintendence of the DUCSU Authority. The Dainik Bangla news reporter Saleh Chowdhury came to visit the sculpture and wrote an article about it. The article illuminated the people of Bangladesh, so the sculptor is known all over the world. In that Article Saleh Choudhury named it as Aparajeyo Bangla and that has been established as permanent name later on by the university authority and the artist (source Prothom Alo news on Saleh Choudhury'/ sad demise on 5 September 2017 and journalist Hasan Shaharear's article on Saleh Choudhury published in Shamokal Bangla newspaper). Before Aparajeyo Bangla there was another 3 feet long sculpture, then Dackshu Authority broke down the sculpture and started to work on Aparajeyo Bangla project. Hasina Ahmed, Syed Hamid Maksood and Badrul Alam Benu, who are very close to Khalid, modelled for 'Aparajeyo Bangla'. The artist closely observed the models' personalities and his close association with them enabled him to do justice with his portrayal. In August 1975 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was murdered so the Dackshu Authority stopped the Aparajeyo Bangla project. Political instability and the arrest of the then vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, Abdul Matin Chowdhury, also disrupted the work. The project remained incomplete till the end of 1978. In January 1979, some fundamentalist groups tried to demolish the Dackshu sculpture Authority. However, the project members and the students of Dhaka University fiercely guarded the work. After a long hiatus, the work began once more in December the beginning of 1979‚Äîwith a new vision. At last the project work was finished on 16 December 1979. The sculpture was inaugurated by wounded freedom fighters. Historical significance Aparajeyo Bangla. After the war, the DUCSU committee proposed the sculpture to commemorate the glory of liberation. In Sayed Abdullah Khalid's sculpture there are 3 statues. The composition of Aparajeyo Bangla is quite mature, the figures are dynamic. In the centre is a statue of a farmer on whose shoulder is a rifle and in whose hand is a grenade, the statue represents the general people of Bangladesh. On the left side there is a lady in whose hand is a first-aid box to indicate that she is a nurse, and in the right side there is a student wearing only a pair of pants and holding a rifle in his hand, to represent youth. All things considered Aparajeyo Bangla is a pioneer in the field of sculptures from the liberation war. For the design of sculpture the lady model was Hasina Ahamed who was a housewife and the farmer model was Badrul Alam Banu who was a student of the art department and the student model was Sayed Hamid Maksud, who was another student of University of Dhaka Sculpture alt=The Sculpture & The Faculty of Arts premises .thumb The Sculpture & The Faculty of Arts premises. The sculpture is built of reinforced concrete with a 4-inch coating, to a height of up to 18 feet. The sculpture was refabricated after inscribing on the base. The sculpture coating was worked under Sahiddullah Associates and the sculpture base was designed by architect Rabioul Hossain. It is a sculpture of the three figures, the central character, a village youth stands in the middle clutching the strap of a rifle in his hand and a grenade in the left . To the left of him is an urban youth with a rifle . At the right is a young lady devoted to nursing with a first aid box at her shoulder. These three represent the concerted strength of the whole Bengali nation. Documentary about the sculpture In 2011 a documentary film about the sculpture was released to mark the 40th anniversary of Bangladesh independence, directed by Saiful Wadud Helal, and produced by Shafiul Wadud. The film presents the background of the 1971 war, and sheds light on attempts by religious fanatics to destroy the structure.

History Clarksburg has been settled in stages dating back as early as the 1850s when Merritt Island was first cleared and developed for agricultural uses. Postal authorities first established a post office in 1876, under the name \\"Clarksburgh\\" and changed the name to \\"Clarksburg\\" in 1893. The town was named after Robert C. Clark who settled at the place in 1849. In the 1920s the New Holland Land Company began subdividing the tracts in the area and formally established Clarksburg as an unincorporated community. Clarksburg is unique among small California towns in that many of the families who initially settled the area are still present, Present day The community is mostly centered on the two churches in town, the Holland Market, the volunteer fire department, the three schools, and the public library. The 1930s era Old Sugar Mill (which closed in 1988) is now the center of development with 125 new homes proposed for construction on the property. This will be the first significant development since the Old Sugar Mill was built in the 1930s. The project is currently stayed by the Delta Protection Commission until it is made compliant with their Resource and Management Plan . Appeals were made to this State of California commission by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Concerned Citizens of Clarksburg. As of February 2008 the Old Sugar Mill development was involved in significant litigation. A portion of the original Old Sugar Mill is now home to a modern wine tasting and production facility. The Bogle Winery on Merritt Island has become the most famous of the Clarksburg appellation vintners with their wines being sold worldwide and being served at the White House as of 2007. The population in 2008 is approximately 300. This is an approximation as the community borders are undefined and opinions on what outlying areas are actually part of Clarksburg vary from one source to the next. The portion of Sacramento County directly across the Sacramento River was once considered part of the community due to the ferry crossing that existed at Clarksburg from 1920 until the Freeport Bridge opened on New Year's Day in 1930. The ferry itself sank in November, 1928. Some of the older members of the community still refer to that adjoining area of Sacramento County as Clarksburg for that reason. Education in Clarksburg is primarily through the schools Clarksburg Middle School and Delta High School of River Delta Unified School District. Architectural heritage Architect William Raymond Yelland would spend summers in Clarksburg with family. W.R. Yelland designed several buildings in the town of Clarksburg including several homes, The Clarksburg Community Church and the Sugar Mill. W.R. Yelland is most noted for his Arts and Crafts and Storybook Houses of the 1920s and 1930s. Industry and agriculture What few industries that exist in the area are mostly involved in supporting the agricultural concerns of the area. Agriculture in the area principally includes wine grapes, dichondra grass seed, and tomatoes. Alfalfa is also found to occur but it is not the principal crop as it was prior to the 1920s. Events and culture The Paul Reese Memorial Clarksburg Country Run occurs every November as it has since 1965 and includes a race, a half-marathon, a 5k fun run, and children's events. The Friends of the Clarksburg Library sponsor The Wines of Clarksburg fundraiser every year to support the local library. The event is typically hosted at the New Holland Land Company's former site and the event is a good excuse to view this example of historic, California Delta architecture.

History The roots of the Primitive Baptist Conference are found in the work of Benjamin Randall, whose convert Asa McCray was instrumental in forming churches in Nova Scotia. These churches were generally known as Free Christian Baptists. George Wightfield Orser (1813‚Äì1885) was ordained among the Free Christian Baptists in 1843. As the idea of salaried ministers developed and grew, Orser stood against the practice, proposing belief in \\"a free gospel and free access to it.\\" Other items of disagreement included Sunday Schools, church discipline, missionary organizations, music, and church offerings. Because of this opposition, Orser was expelled from the Free Christian Baptists in 1874. In July 1875, representatives from seven churches met and formed the Free Baptist Conference of New Brunswick. Due to disagreements over the use of the name \\"Free Baptist\\", Orser's group incorporated under the name Primitive Baptist Conference of New Brunswick in 1898. As churches were added from Nova Scotia, Maine and Massachusetts, the conference became the Primitive Baptist Conference of New Brunswick, Maine and Nova Scotia. The Nova Scotia churches incorporated a regional conference -- Primitive Baptist Conference of Nova Scotia‚Äîin 1926. In July 1981, 16 churches joined the Free Will Baptists and became the regional Atlantic Canada Association of Free Will Baptists in alignment with the National Association of Free Will Baptists. A small group of Christians from these churches have maintained themselves separately as Primitive Baptists.

Biography=Early life and career Georg Friedrich Kauffmann was born in Ostramondra, Thuringia. Little is known of his early life; however, he did have early keyboard training with J.H. Buttstett in Erfurt. His latter years of education were under J.F. Alberti in Merseburg with whom he studied organ and composition. In 1698, Alberti suffered an injury to his right hand, inhibiting his ability to play the organ at the cathedral. Kauffmann replaced Alberti permanently as teacher in Merseburg as well as court and cathedral organist upon Alberti‚Äôs death in 1710. Kauffmann is also attributed to have ascertained during this period the occupation of Director of Church Music for the Duke of Saxe-Merseburg, and might have also served as Kapellmeister. However, these positions are only speculative at best due to an absence of archival investigations. (Note: Kauffmann signed many of his published works as Court Organist and Director of Church Music for the Duke of Saxe-Merseburg, so it is quite likely that he did serve in such a capacity, even if just ceremonial.) Mid-life and the Leipzig Affair Kauffmann had several connections with Leipzig, as most predominant musicians of the time in Germany would have. At one point, he was originally asked by the university there to inspect the newly finished organ at St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral (a very large honor at the time) ‚Äì however, the offer ultimately went to Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1725, Kauffmann announced his intentions of the publication of a treatise to be entitled: Intro duzzione alla musica antica et moderna, das ist: Eine auf√ºhrliche Einleitung zur alten und neuen Wissenschaft der edlen Music. (In English: Rules for Composition in the Old and New Styles.) It was never formally published, though it did circulate around the musical community of the day and most likely was used by many educators as a teaching tool. Ultimately Kauffmann went to Leipzig in 1722 to compete for the position of Kapellmeister along with seven other predominant musicians of Germany at the time. The position of Kapellmeister of Leipzig was extremely coveted by most in the musical community; the position was formally held by Johann Kuhnau until his death that same year. Kauffmann‚Äôs audition went well, even though he asked for a second hearing by the town council who were responsible for hiring. He was the prime contender for the position until April 1723 when J.S. Bach was hired. Late Life and the Harmonische Seelenlust A decade after the Leipzig Affair, Kauffmann started to publish in sequential volumes his Harmonische Seelenlust which were a complete edition of his organ chorales. However, he died of consumption in Merseburg on 24 March 1735 before they had been completely published. His widow saw the endeavor though and completed the publication of the Harmonische Seelenlust. While they did not make a great first impression, over the next century they became one of the most significant achievements in German organ music, and remained in high demand well into the 19th century. They consisted of ninety-eight preludes on sixty-three chorales. Many of his organ works can be found in organ text books and instructional materials today. Proliferation of Works=Copied and Transcribed Works An important aspect of Baroque composition was who copied the compositions down to perform in their churches or courts as printing music was very novel at the time and very expensive. J.G. Walther (a friend of Bach) copied many of his early works, as well as Johann Tobias Krebs, a pupil of Walther. Johann Kuhnau and two scribes copied parts from Kauffmann‚Äôs Solo Cantaten, and performed them on 16 August 1722, and after Kauffmann‚Äôs death in their respected churches. Gottfried Kirchhoff (the Halle organist) owned several other cantatas by Kauffmann, all of which were performed in Halle, however none of the manuscripts survived. In 1727, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, who was studying in Merseburg with J.G. Graun, copied three choral works which were ultimately performed by J.S. Bach‚Äôs choir. (see The Bach Connection) Well Known Works *Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ *Harmonische Seelenlust musikalischer Gonner und Freunde: Wer nur den lieben Gott l√§sst walten *Nun danket alle Gott *Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren on Johann Gramann's hymn *O Herre Gott, dein g√∂ttlich Wort *O Jesulein s√ºss *Unverzagt, beklemmtes Herz *Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern The Bach Connection One of the most important questions that surround Kauffmann‚Äôs life was how much of an influence was he upon Johann Sebastian Bach. While it can be hard to know who was imitating who, both of the works can be seen similar in certain motives and harmonic progressions, though it is obvious that Bach was the better master of these things. J.G. Walther‚Äôs friendship with Bach while transcribing some of Kauffmann‚Äôs early works can lead to influential questions, as well as Bach‚Äôs education of members of the Krebs family, Kuhnau‚Äôs employment by Bach in latter years (in which he brought at least three choral pieces to Bach's choir which they performed). Also Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, J.S. Bach‚Äôs eldest son, studied with Graun in Merseburg as well as transcribing some of Kauffmann works with Kuhnau. While there is little question of Bach‚Äôs awareness of Kauffmann, there are deeper questions of imitation and musical evolution. Today Kauffmann was recently used as part of Itamar Moses‚Äô play, Bach at Leipzig, in which he is seeking employment at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig upon the death of Johann Kuhnau, the Kapellmeister. The play uses Kauffmann as well as many other composers of the time all bidding for the job, which ultimately goes to J.S. Bach. See A Curtain Up Review; Bach at Leipzig for additional information.

While working as a foreign correspondent of The Times in Constantinople, he exposed The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as an antisemitic plagiarism, fraud and hoax. Life Graves, eldest son of the writer Alfred Perceval Graves (1846‚Äì1931), was born in Ballylickey Manor, County Cork, Ireland, into a prominent Anglo-Irish family. He studied in Haileybury and Oxford University, where he received a BA from Oriel College in March 1900. He was the elder half brother of the authors Robert Graves and Charles Graves.Ballylickey Manor History As a correspondent of The Times in Constantinople from 1908 to 1914, he reported on the events preceding World War I. In 1914, as a British citizen, he had to leave the Ottoman Empire due to the war. In 1915‚Äì1919, he served in the British Army in the Middle East war theatre. As a captain in Army Intelligence in Cairo he worked with T. E. Lawrence on the Turkish Army Manual for the Arab Bureau. His uncle Sir Robert Windham Graves had been British Consul in Erzurum (1895) and financial adviser to the Turkish government (1912) and worked for Civil Intelligence in Cairo during the same period. Graves exposed the Protocols as a forgery in The Times. 16‚Äì18 August 1921 After 1919, Graves reported from his own homeland on the Anglo-Irish War. He knew Michael Collins, W. T. Cosgrave, and various other leaders of the Irish independence movement, and was closely involved in reporting events during this critical period of Irish history. He later worked as a foreign correspondent in India, the Levant and in the Balkans, before returning to London to work as an editor of The Times. In 1921 he exposed The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as an anti-Semitic forgery in a series of articles in The Times. His most monumental work was 22 of the 24-volume quarterly review of the events of and participants in World War II that was authored during the conflict, the first two volumes being authored by Sir Ronald Storrs. Graves received numerous international awards and titles, among which are French L√©gion d'honneur that he received for his work in British intelligence during the First World WarGraves, R. P., Robert Graves: The assault heroic, Biography 1895-1926. and the Order of the Crown of Italy. In his journeys, Philip Graves developed an interest in entomology and published articles in scientific journals. He was member of the Royal Irish Academy. He retired in 1946 to Ballylickey Manor and dedicated himself mainly to zoological hobbies. Here he made a study of the Irish butterflies, being especially interested in the local sub-species. He restored Ballylickey House as a hotel, which was taken over by his son after his death. Entomology Graves specialised in butterflies (Lepidoptera) of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine, often working with Robert Eldon Ellison, a career diplomat and fellow Irishman (born in Wingstown, near Dublin). His published work on insects reflects the strengths of his collection but not its extent. In 1938, for instance, he presented more than 2,500 specimens to the Natural History Museum, London. These are described in the catalogue of acquisitions Rhopalocera (Levant and Balkans). There are a few specimens, including an excellent series of Archon apollinus in the Ulster Museum, Belfast. His published work on insects includes: *Collecting Lepidoptera in Syria, 1905 Entomologist‚Äôs Rec. J. Var 18:125-6 (1906). *Collecting in Syria: Ain Zhalta in May -June 1905. Entomologist's Rec. J.

Career Filomeno made his professional debut in March 1996 playing for Nueva Chicago and being still 15 years old. He was one of the youngest players to this day to start playing professionally in Argentina. He was then noticed by English club Newcastle United F.C. and made his first move to Europe. He did not play officially for Newcastle and moved to Italy where he signed first for Udinese and then for Inter Milan. A year later he returned to Argentina to join San Lorenzo de Almagro where he contributed to the club winning of the Argentine \\"Torneo Clausura\\" 2001 and the Southamerican \\"Copa Mercosur\\" 2001. Subsequently, he moved to Mexico where he joined Jaguares de Chiapas in their inaugural 2002 season, scoring the team's first goal ever in a 3‚Äì1 loss to Tigres. In 2005, he joined Busan IPark, but he appeared in only League Cup 8 matches. In 2006, he returned to Argentina to join his original club, Nueva Chicago.

For example, in a study of the demand for money, the unit of observation might be chosen as the individual, with different observations (data points) for a given point in time differing as to which individual they refer to; or the unit of observation might be the country, with different observations differing only in regard to the country they refer to. A study may have a differing unit of observation and unit of analysis: for example, in community research, the research design may collect data at the individual level of observation but the level of analysis might be at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals. Together, the unit of observation and the level of analysis define the population of a research enterprise. Data point A data point or observation is a set of one or more measurements on a single member of unit of observation. For example, in a study of the determinants of money demand with the unit of observation being the individual, a data point might be the values of income, wealth, age of individual, and number of dependents. Statistical inference about the population would be conducted using a statistical sample consisting of various such data points. In addition, in statistical graphics, a \\"data point\\" may be an individual item with a statistical display; such points may relate to either a single member of a population or to a summary statistic calculated for a given subpopulation. Types of data The measurements contained a unit of observation are formally typed, where here type is used in a way compatible with datatype in computing; so that the type of measurement can specify whether the measurement results in a Boolean value from {yes, no}, an integer or real number, the identity of some category, or some vector or array. The implication of point is often that the data may be plotted in a graphic display, but in many cases the data are processed numerically before that is done. In the context of statistical graphics, measured values for individuals or summary statistics for different subpopulations are displayed as separate symbols within a display; since such symbols can differ by shape, size and colour, a single data point within a display can convey multiple aspects of the set of measurements for an individual or subpopulation.

The unit of analysis should not be confused with the unit of observation. The unit of observation is a subset of the unit of analysis. In social science research, the most commonly referenced unit of analysis, considered to be a society is the state (polity) (i.e. country). Common units of observation include groups, organizations, and institutions. The unit of observation is the unit described by one's data (neighborhoods using the U.S. Census, individuals using surveys, etc.). For example, a study may treat groups as a unit of observation with a country as the unit of analysis, drawing conclusions on group characteristics from data collected at the national level. Dependency Theory and world-systems analysis challenged the treatment of countries as societies or units of analysis and the assumption that each country develops separately through stages from agrarian to industrial, from authoritarian to democratic, from backwards to advanced, by raising historical evidence. The development of an uneven division of labor (world-economy) shows factors of causality that account for changes within countries indicating that countries are part of a larger society or historical social system with systemic patterns that account for global inequality. The literature of international relations provides a good example of units of analysis system.

Their long and continued history of activism in cryonics make them among the most well-known cryonics pioneers. David Pascal wrote in the November/December 2005 issue of the Mensa Bulletin that, second to the man credited with the original idea for cryonics, Robert Ettinger, the Chamberlains have contributed more than anyone to the field of cryonics. Cryonics Fred and Linda Chamberlain met in 1970 as a result of their mutual interest in cryonics. They were both on a committee to organize the Third National Conference On Cryonics sponsored by the Cryonics Society of California (CSC). Fred worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as one of its space program engineers and was married with two children. However, his and Linda's partners did not share their interest in cryonics. Fred and Linda became a couple and devoted themselves to cryonics, formed a cryonics corporation (Manrise) and wrote the first detailed procedure manual for cryonics that had ever existed. By the spring of 1971, they were legally married and were preparing to give a presentation on their procedures manual, complete with a working prototype of a perfusion system, at the Fourth National Conference On Cryonics in San Francisco. There was strong resistance to taking cryonics into high technology too quickly, within CSC, and there were other problems, including almost total secrecy as to how CSC's decisions were made and how it was organized and operated. By the summer of 1971, these stresses were beginning to weaken their confidence in CSC, and they felt that they were forced to withdraw from it and pursue some other route. Fred's father Fred's father was a very fragile stroke victim, so they formed a new cryonics organization they named Alcor early in 1972, and (through Manrise Corporation) assisted with the founding of Trans Time, Inc in the San Francisco Bay area (providing its first perfusion equipment by a contractual arrangement). Cryonics pioneer Mike Darwin moved to California and became the technological core of Alcor for over a year, during which he conducted the first organized research ever done in cryonics on a dedicated basis, supported by Manrise Corporation. Attempts to raise capital for continued research through a new corporation failed, and Mike Darwin returned to his home in Indianapolis, Indiana. Fred's father was cryopreserved in the summer of 1976, the first neuropreservation ever. Fred's father was stored under contract at Trans Time, Inc. Alcor's Board of Directors was expanded, its methods of electing Directors were changed, Jerry Leaf became part of the cryonics team, and there was a merger of Manrise Corporation with Trans Time, Inc. All of these developments considerably improved the strength of Alcor and the cryonics movement. After 1976, the Chamberlains preferred others to run day- to-day operations of Alcor. Fred and Linda then moved to Lake Tahoe, Nevada and started a new property management business, Paradise Rentals. They became the hosts for an annual \\"Lake Tahoe Life Extension Festival\\", until 1986. It started because as part of the merger of Manrise Corporation with Trans Time, Inc., Linda became a director of Trans Time, Inc. as well as of Alcor. In the 1970s in association with the cryonics conferences they were holding at Lake Tahoe, the Chamberlains wrote a series of cryonics-related short stories, and published those stories along with stories by other cryonicists and transhumanists. Entitled LifeQuest: Dozens of Stories about Cryonics, Uploading, and other Transhuman Adventures, the book was republished in 2009. Linda's mother Linda's mother Arlene Fried attended one of the festivals, and with Linda's urging joined Alcor and maintained arrangements for several years. Then, she developed terminal cancer that had been unsuspected until the last moment. Alcor mobilized a highly supported remote standby for that. Both Jerry Leaf and Mike Darwin were on hand for nearly a week in Sonoma, California, as Linda's mother went through the final stages of a deliberate dehydration on her part, with hospice support. The outcome was a very high- quality cryopreservation for the time (1990), the best of its kind at that date. Bankruptcy and subsequent events In 1993, concerned that Alcor was in danger of political chaos, Alcor employee Hugh Hixon persuaded the Chamberlains to become involved with Alcor's activities and in the fall of that year, amidst much turmoil, Fred was elected as an Alcor Director, and the Chamberlains accompanied Alcor in its move to Scottsdale, Arizona. In February 1997, Steve Bridge resigned as President of Alcor, and the Chamberlains offered to devote themselves to Alcor full-time. Fred became Alcor President and Linda became the Suspension Manager (the person responsible for application of cryopreservation protocol). Alcor was in a difficult position when the Chamberlains came on board, as to maintaining pace with technology advances and paying for its staff at the same time. A Life Membership program was initiated, and a supporting corporation was formed by Linda to take over the responsibilities for cryopreservation services (BioTransport, Inc.), following the patterns established earlier by Manrise Corporation, Trans Time, Inc., and Cryovita Corporation (Jerry Leaf's start-up cryonics provider organization). Many difficulties in raising capital and finding the right mix of people led to the subsidiary for cell storage (Cells4Life, Inc.), and failure to raise capital finally forced both corporations into a defunct state. The Chamberlains had signed for all of the unsecured debt and leases of equipment in both of these corporations (BioTransport, Inc. and Cells4Life, Inc.). In the collapse of these and in the context of an unresolved dispute with Alcor over reimbursement of BioTransport, Inc. for expenses incurred in launching Alcor's vitrification program, the Chamberlains liquidated their life insurance policies for cryonics arrangements and finally had to file bankruptcy. The circumstances of Linda's forced resignation as President of Alcor only a few months after assuming this role, together with their failure to resolve financial matters with Alcor as mentioned above, finally led to the Chamberlains joining the Cryonics Institute (CI) in July 2002, but they went back to being Alcor Members in March, 2011. Linda Chamberlain wrote the science fiction novel Star Pebble that explored the question of how to define life, which was published in 2010. Death Fred died and was cryopreserved on March 22, 2012, by Alcor Life Extension Foundation. See also * Life extension ReferencesNotes *1.

The highway connects Highway 400 in Parry Sound with Highway 11 in Sundridge, a distance of , including a concurrency with Highway 520\\\\. It is one of several highways in central Ontario to provide this connection through the Muskoka and Parry Sound region, and the northernmost King's Highway prior to Highway 17\\\\.  Route description  Highway 124 is one of several highways connecting the Highway 11 and Highway 69/400 corridors between Barrie and Highway 17. The route is generally lightly travelled, primarily serving local communities along the corridor. Besides Highway 520, only one other provincial highway, Highway 510, is encountered along the route. There are no large communities along the route between Parry Sound and Sundridge, however there are several small communities including Waubamik, McKellar, Dunchurch and Ahmic Harbour. The village of Magnetawan is also located a short distance south of the highway. The route begins immediately north of Parry Sound at Exit 231 on Highway 400\\\\. From that interchange, the highway progresses northwards through the Municipality of McDougall, passing through the communities of Badger's Corners and Waubamik, where it encounters the Bunny Trail, before curving east and weaving around dozens of lakes. Curving north, the highway enters McKellar, then the Municipality of Whitestone. Within Whitestone, the highway wanders northeast through communities including Fairholme, Sunny Slope and Dunchurch before turning east and meeting Highway 520 near Whitestone Lake, which travels concurrently with Highway 124 for . It also passes between two reserves: the Shawanaga Lake Provincial Conservation Reserve, which lies northwest of Sunny Slope, and the Ahmic Forest and Rock Barrens Provincial Conservation Reserve, which lies south of the highway as it passes from Whitestone into the Municipality of Magnetawan. The route wanders along the shore of Ahmic Lake, passing the community of Ahmic Harbour and later crossing the Magnetawan River immediately north of Knoepfli Falls. The highway weaves through forests and exposed Canadian Shield as it travels eastward. North of the town of Magnetawan, Highway 520 departs to the south to pass through the community. Shortly thereafter, Highway 124 meets Highway 510 at the Nipissing Colonization Road. The route travels in a straight line due east for several kilometres, dipping south momentarily then entering the community of Pearcley. After this, the highway enters Strong Township. It passes through the community of Strong and continues generally eastward for several kilometres before ending at a new junction with Highway 11.  History  Highway 124 was first assumed by the Department of Highways on October 19, 1955, with a length of in length. Although minor realignments over the years since have reduced that length to , the highway has remained relatively unchanged since its designation. With the completion of the Sundridge Bypass in 2012, Highway 124 was extended eastward approximately through Sundridge and South River along the former route of Highway 11\\\\.  Major intersections  Highway 124 facing east at the still-under construction Highway 11 interchange in 2011.
