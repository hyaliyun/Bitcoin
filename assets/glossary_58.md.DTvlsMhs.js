Part of the Mequon- Thiensville School District, it serves a area including the city of Mequon and the village of Thiensville. The school opened in 1959 and educates nearly 1,300 students annually. Its graduation rate is 99%, and its most recent average composite ACT scores were 23.4, the seventeenth-highest of any public school in the state. Homestead is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. History The area on which Homestead High School now stands originally belonged to the Potawatomi and Menominee Indians. In 1838, the land was taken by the United States government. Sales of the land occurred in 1835. In 1841 and Peter and Anna Frank received a land grant for the area, and in the following years, the 80-acre land area was owned by their children. Homestead High School opened in 1959. Dr. Merton Campbell served as the first superintendent, and Lauren Dixon served as the first principal. Originally the school consisted of four wings, two music rooms, a small theater, cafeteria, and a gymnasium. Homestead has undergone four renovations/additions. In 1962, another wing was added. Three additional wings, the library, a swimming area, another gymnasium, a lecture hall, and an auditorium were added in 1968. In 1978, the school added an orchestra room. In 1998, the biggest renovation added a wing, a new heating and cooling system, fine arts rooms, another cafeteria with a food court, an academic support center, a field house for athletics, and a conference room for the district. Enrollment Homestead's enrollment decreased from 1610 in 2003, to 1405 in 2011-2012, and to 1282 in 2015-16. Of the 1282 students, 0.3% are Native American, 1.8% are Latino, 3.6% are Asian, 3.3% are African American, and 91.0% are White. Academics Homestead High School teaches courses in business, computer science, cooperative education, engineering and technology, English, family and consumer education, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, physical education, science, and social studies. Honors courses include algebra 1, algebra 2/trigonometry, American literature, American studies-English, American studies-social studies, biology, British literature, business organization and management, calculus AB I, chemistry, English 9/argumentation, English 9, expository writing, French 4, geometry, German 4, independent study, Latin 4, multi-variable calculus, physics, pre-calculus, product development project, Spanish 4, and world studies. Homestead offers A.P. classes in French, German, calculus AB, calculus BC, physics, Spanish, statistics, United States history, American government, biology, chemistry, macroeconomics, microeconomics, psychology, English language, and English literature. The graduation rate for the school has been 99% or better for at least the past 10 consecutive years.Mequon-Thiensville School District Of the Class of 2011, 86% of the students were planning to attend a four-year college, 5% to attend two-year colleges, and 9% to work. Recognition In 2004 Homestead High School was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School, the highest honor a school can receive from the U.S. Department of Education. It was one of 33 public high schools in the United States to receive the honor that year. In 2009, BusinessWeek magazine ranked Homestead as the top high school in Wisconsin. The magazine noted that Homestead offered the \\"Best Overall Academic Performance\\". In 2011, Homestead was named one of the top 500 schools in the nation by Newsweek. Athletics Homestead won a state championship in boys cross country in 1967.

Case history In 1933, Annie Noble had purchased a lot for a cottage in the Beach O' Pines area on Lake Huron. She decided in 1948 to sell the lot to Bernard Wolf, however, it was noticed that the original deed contained the following clause: :(f) The lands and premises herein described shall never be sold, assigned, transferred, leased, rented or in any manner whatsoever alienated to, and shall never be occupied or used in any manner whatsoever by any person of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the intention and purpose of the Grantor, to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the lands and premises herein described, to persons of the white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause. Though Wolf was Jewish, Noble still wanted to sell him the land and so they applied to the court to get the covenant nullified, but faced opposition from the \\"Pines\\" community. Noble and Wolf cited the recent decision of Re Drummond Wren, where the Ontario Court struck down a discriminatory covenant. However, at trial and on appeal the courts upheld the restriction. The Supreme Court, in a six to one ruling, held that the covenant was invalid. They agreed with the lower court's dismissal of Drummond Wren and instead looked at the law of restrictive covenants and held that the language used in the restriction on alienation was too uncertain. As Rand J explained in his judgment, such covenants would need to comply with the rule expressed in Tulk v Moxhay, in that they \\"should touch or concern the land as contradistinguished from a collateral effect.\\"SCC, p. 69 As the covenant in this case was \\"directed not to the land or to some mode of its use, but to transfer by act of the purchaser,\\"SCC, p. 69 it had to fail in that it was \\"impossible to set such limits to the lines of race or blood as would enable a court to say in all cases whether a proposed purchaser is or is not within the ban.\\"SCC, p. 70, relying on Clayton v Ramsden, [1943] AC 320, and Impact While the case went through the courts, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed an Act that declared such restrictive covenants to be \\"void and of no effect,\\" but it only applied to ones created on or after March 24, 1950, its date of Royal assent. While the covenants in the deeds constituting the community at Beach O' Pines were held to be ineffective, others created before the amendment (as long as they complied with Tulk v Moxhay) were still considered to be valid, as the Ontario Court of Appeal stated that they did not offend public policy.

It inhabits Arctic regions of Alaska as well as Siberia and the Bering Sea islands. Description Alaska blackfish are small, with an average length of , but have been known to reach . They have an easily distinguishable morphology, with relatively large, posterior dorsal fin and anal fins, large, lobed pectoral fins located just posterior to the operculum, a diphycercal caudal fin, and small, pointy pelvic fins. The head is broad and flat, with the trunk being long and slender. The color is dark green to brown on the dorsal side, pale below, with light- colored blotches appearing laterally. Males can be distinguished from females by the presence of a reddish fringe along the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins; also, the tips of the ventral fins extend beyond the anal fin in males, whereas in females they do not.Armstrong, Robert H. Alaska Blackfish. Adfg.alaska.gov, ADF&G;, 1994, www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/education/wns/alaska_blackfish.pdf.Froese, Rainier. Dallia Pectoralis Summary Page. Edited by Susan M Luna, FishBase.org, www.fishbase.org/summary/2705. The Alaska blackfish is famous for its ability to breathe atmospheric oxygen through a modified esophagus.Crawford, R. H. 1974. Structure of an air-breathing organ and the swim bladder in the Alaska Blackfish, Dallia Pectoralis Bean. Canadian Journal of Zoology 52(10):1221-1225. www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/z74-162. Specifically, the esophagus of a blackfish can be subdivided into a non- respiratory and a respiratory section. The respiratory section can be identified by its extensive mucosal folding and vascularization, as well as widespread capillaries throughout the epithelium. This respiratory structure implies selection pressures for the development of a purely respiratory organ and a purely hydrostatic organ. The interesting factor is the retention of the hydrostatic swim bladder, which seems unnecessary unless it is important in maintaining neutral buoyancy in the cold winter months under ice cover. Distribution and habitat Alaska blackfish can be found in the Bering Sea Islands, Siberia, and Alaska. In Alaska, they inhabit the Colville Delta south to the central Alaska Peninsula near Chignik as well as the upstream Yukon- Tanana drainage to near Fairbanks. Blackfish are found in highly vegetated swamps and ponds, occasionally residing in rivers and densely-vegetated lakes, where in summer, water is frequently stagnant. Spawning migrations are limited to inshore and upstream movements in the spring, and reverse migrations to deeper water in the fall. In the winter-time, blackfish tend to reside in the benthic regions of lakes, although when oxygen availability reaches a certain minimum, blackfish move to the surface, grouping around breathing holes.Anderson, David B, et al. 2004. \\"Traditional ecological knowledge and contemporary subsistence harvest of non-salmon fish in the Koyukuk River Drainage, Alaska\\". Technical Paper (282). These breathing areas can be preexisting holes, such as those created by muskrats, beavers, and fishermen, or simply thin layers of ice. Blackfish have been observed schooling below the ice, and when swimming upwards to breathe, eat away at the ice and creating an audible snapping or sucking sound. The Alaska blackfish is known for its tolerance of cold water, and has been reported to survive exposure to -20 ¬∞C for 40 minutes. Despite its hardiness, Alaska blackfish have been observed to suffer edema and mass mortality events during the winter. Feeding and diet The principal source of food for blackfish is aquatic insects and invertebrates, although in Bristol Bay, larger blackfish have been observed to be cannibalistic, as well as predators of young pike. Blackfish are generalist feeders, and have been analyzed to have contained algae, snails, dipteran larvae, ostracods, copepods, and caddis fly larvae in their stomachs.Ostdiek, John L. and Nardone, Roland M. 1959. Studies on the Alaska Blackfish Dallia Pectoralis I. habitat, size, and stomach analyses. The American Midland Naturalist 61(1):218-229. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2422353. Reproduction Spawning occurs from May to August, with fish having the ability to spawn several times; thus, females do not usually expel their entire egg contents in a single event. A female, depending on her size, can release a total of 40-300 eggs at intervals during the spawning period, with the eggs then attaching to vegetation and hatching in a short period of time (nine days at ). When the young hatch, they are approximately 6 mm in length, and survive off the yolk sac for an average period of 10 days. Rate of growth varies throughout Alaska, with blackfish from Interior Alaska and the Anchorage area being about at age 2, at age 3, and at age 4. On the other hand, Bristol Bay blackfish are much slower growing and longer lived. Four- year-old fish are approximately in length, but can live up to 8 years. Female blackfish have been shown to reach sexual maturity at . Importance to humans The Alaska blackfish is an important subsistence fish for Native communities residing in the Interior and Western Alaska, specifically those residing in Interior Alaska. Although generally small (average size is ), their significance comes in their high nutritional value and large abundance in the winter, a generally lean time of year. When oxygen levels in the benthic regions of lakes becomes low, blackfish move to the surface to obtain atmospheric oxygen, thus making ice fishing an easy method of capture; blackfish are commonly stored, frozen, and then fed to dogs, with certain Alaskan stories recollecting moments when blackfish would seemingly revive themselves upon thawing. Metabolic and survival studies have been conducted without successful replication of this observation. Conservation Status The Alaska blackfish is not IUCN-listed as an endangered or threatened species. While blackfish are native to Western Alaska as well as the Interior, they were introduced to the Cook Inlet Basin of Alaska in the 1950s, and have since become widespread.Eidam, Dona M. et.al. 2016. Trophic ecology of introduced populations of Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) in the Cook Inlet Basin, Alaska. Environmental Biology of Fishes 99(6-7): 557-569. A study performed by Eidam et.al. (2016) in three study sites in the Cook Inlet Basin concluded that an insignificant portion of their diet was fish, meaning blackfish are unlikely to impact native and stocked fish in those populations. While that information is helpful for determining whether blackfish are truly invasive, it is not all-encompassing for other blackfish populations in the area. Further studies are warranted that estimate the abundance of introduced blackfish in lakes and streams in the Cook Inlet Basin as well as investigate potential dietary overlap with other fish.  Phylogeography and Population Genetics  Molecular study of Alaska blackfish across its range has identified several geographic areas where Alaska blackfish persisted during glacial episodes. Genetic structuring within the species is relatively high for a fish species from northern latitudes, most likely reflecting biological characteristics such as poor dispersal ability and winter survival.

The barbat was an important instrument of the Ghassanids in pre-Islamic times and of the Syrians in early Islamic times. It was characterized as carved from a single piece of wood, including the neck and a wooden sound board. It would be ancestral to the wood-topped oud, pipa and biwa and the skin-topped Yemeni qanbus. Although the original barbat disappeared, modern musicians have re-created the instrument, looking at historical images for details. The modern re-created instrument (Persian Barbat) resembles the oud, although differences include a smaller body, longer neck, a slightly raised fingerboard, and a sound that is distinct from that of the oud. History The barbat probably originated in Central Asia. The earliest image of the barbat dates back to the 1st century BC from ancient northern Bactria. While in his book (Les instruments de musique de l‚ÄôInde ancienne) Marcel-Dubois pointed out a more \\"clear cut\\" depiction of the barbat from Gandhara sculpture dated to the 2nd-4th centuries AD, which may well have been introduced by the Kushan aristocracy whose influence is attested in Gandharan art. The name itself meant short-necked lute in Pahlavi, the language of the Sasanian Empire, through which the instrument came west from Central Asia to the Middle East, adopted by the Persians. The barbat (possibly known as mizhar, kirƒÅn, or muwatter, all skin topped versions, like the rud) was used by some Arabs in the sixth century. At the end of the 6th century, a wood topped version of the Persian-styled instrument was constructed by al Nadr, called \\"≈´d\\", and introduced from Iraq to Mecca. This Persian-style instrument was being played there in the seventh century. Sometime in the seventh century it was modified or \\"perfected\\" by Mansour Zalzal, and the two instruments (barbat and \\"≈´d shabb≈´t\\") were used side by side into the 10th century, and possibly longer. The two instruments have been confused by modern scholars looking for examples, and some of the ouds identified may possibly be barbats. Examples of this cited in the Encyclopedia of Islam include a lute in the Cantigas de Santa Maria and the frontispiece from The Life and Times of Ali Ibn ISA by Harold Bowen. Kusana origin of short lutes Laurence Picken in his 1955 article The Origin of the Short Lute laid out an argument for the lute originating in the lands of the Kusana peoples. He looked at the likely places for the short ovoid lute to originate. He showed that the evidence found by 1955 indicated that China would not likely have had the such a lute earlier than the 5th century. He found no evidence of the Sasainian barbad or barbud earlier than the 4th century A.D. The earliest evidence was to be found among the Kusanas. He considered other peoples further west, but only found evidence of long-necked lutes. The only other possibility was among the \\"Elamic clay figures\\" from the 8th century B.C. These were discounted, as \\"no structural detail are visible.\\" He was careful to point out that his conclusions were based on the evidence which had been unearthed by 1955, from literature and art. Iconographic evidence In his paper which summarized what was known about early examples of Asian harps and lutes, focusing on images and literature for his sources, Michael Nixon pointed out that one image of the barbat from Sasanian Iran (estimated origin in his paper 3rd-7th centuries A.D and 7th-8th centuries A.D. by the British Museum) resembled other images of the barbat from Sasanian and Gandharan sources. He said that the instrument itself resembled these and was held in the same manner. The instrument also resembled an image from a door-lintel bas-relief from the Gupta period in Padmavati Pawaya, India.(240-605). A.D.) The Ganharan image he points to (c. 2nd-4th centuries A.D.) was published in Kurt Sachs' book The History of Musical Instruments in 1940. It shows a man holding a lute-style instrument with bottom of the rounded bowl of the instrument held to his chest, the neck of the instrument held down at a approximately 45 degree angle, and the man strumming the instrument near his chest. Another image from Gandhara from an overlapping time period (100-320 A.D.) is in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art. The image shows a similarly shaped instrument, with similar bridge (the bar at the bottom of the instrument's bowl) held and strummed in the same manner. This image, unlike the other two mentioned, shows sound holes, an indication that this instrument had a wooden soundboard and not a skin top. Jean During, who wrote the 1988 Barbat article used by the Encyclopedia Iranica, cites two images of short lutes as being the oldest currently known. One is in ·∏¥a·∏∑ƒçayƒÅn (Uzbekistan), c. 1st century A.D. The other, \\"at the moment the oldest evidence of the existence of the barba·π≠,\\" was at Dal‚Äôverzin Tepe, c. 1st century B.C. Another early source of lute images from Central Asia comes from East Kashkadarya, where coroplast statuettes (c. 1st Century B.C. to 1st Century A.D.) from the Kangyui period were found, female lutenists that appear religious, depicting a female goddess playing a lute. The Kangyui Kingdom was in the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan region from the 2nd century B.C. to the 4th century A.D. The lutes are short lutes, but the detail in the statuettes is low. Whether they are the same as the other short lutes in the area is not clear. The modern instrument=Holding the barbat The barbat is held similar to a guitar, but care must be taken to have the face vertical so that it is not visible to the player, and to support the weight with the thigh and right arm so that the left hand is free to move around the fingerboard. Note the idiosyncratic manner of holding the mizrab (Turkish) or risha (Arabic, lit. \\"feather\\") or pick; although it seems awkward it is in reality easier than a conventional flatpick and gives the \\"right\\" tonal shading to the plucked note. In all matters of holding and playing it is recommended that the player use only the muscles needed for any musical task and to relax as much as possible, using only as much force as is necessary. This will allow one to play longer, easier and to put the effort into creativity rather than mechanics. In the past many players sat cross-legged on a rug, but now most perform sitting, often using a classical guitarist's footrest under the right foot to help hold the barbat. Basic fingering Two methods of left hand fingering are in current usage. The older, more traditional Classical Arabic approach uses all four fingers for stopping the strings, one for each semitone much as a guitarist; alternatively, some play with a style more akin to baglama (or saz) or sitar technique, using mainly the first and second fingers, with less use of the third and little use of the fourth fingers. Hakki Obadia taught a mixed fingering system that uses finger 1 for several notes, finger 2 for some, but not all strings and finger 3, but not finger 4. Another important facet of left hand technique is the employment of the fingernail to help stop the string, giving a clearer tone and more pronounced ornaments than use of the fleshy tips alone. This is common to several other fretless instrument, among them the sarod, shamisen and san- xien. Right hand-the mizrab or risha As mentioned the right hand employs a special method for holding the quill-inspired pick called risha in Arabic and mizrab in Turkish. The long flexible pick puts the wrist at a particular angle and adds a certain tonal color to the sound. The traditional material was an eagle quill, but this is not practical; plastic makes a more durable and standard material for the risha. Players have used things like collar stays, plastic pieces from hardware stores, cut-up plastic bottles ( this worked better with the old heavyweight containers), and of course the Turkish manufactured models. These come in a thin, more-or-less pointed tip style made of lighter gauge translucent plastic and a round tip model made of heavier white opaque stock. The thinner ones are lovely sounding and play very delicately with subtle nuances; the heavier ones play very loud. Variations can be obtained by cutting a new tip on the thinner ones a bit further back where the plastic is a little thicker, adding volume to the attack. The rounded ones can be cut to a pointer shape and thinned a fraction with fine sandpaper adding nuance to the heavier attack produced by this pick. Both kinds are made double-ended from the factory, so one end can be left original and the other end customized, the player using the appropriate end for the musical need. Body The barbat's body contains three major parts: *Resonating body: It is like a pear and it is the biggest resonating body in comparison with other bodies. There are three sound holes and lattices on its body, one bigger than two others. *Fingerboard: Without frets (or fretless), and the neck. Some earlier illustrations show frets arranged to include microtones. *Bent-back pegbox: There is a great angle between the fingerboard/neck and pegbox. This is very important, it has several tuning pegs and if the bent-back pegbox is weak, the instrument won‚Äôt be tuned very well. Traditional materials of the barbat *Resonating body: Walnut or maple. *String fastener or bridge: Boxwood. *Top sheet: Deal *Neck: Walnut *Nut: Bone or plastic *Pegbox: Walnut *Pegs: Walnut or ebony *Lattices of hole: Walnut How to make a barbat's resonating body There are two traditional methods: Carved body: For this a log is cut in two pieces. On one a silhouette of the body is drawn, then the half log would be carved and scraped by tools from the inside and outside. Then it will be left to be dried. Constructed body: In this method sections of walnut or mulberry wood are cut and boiled in hot water. These sections or ribs should have the thickness around 2 -3 mm. When they are flexible they are stressed on a crescent shaped mold or former. After drying, they will be glued and joined to each other. Then the neck and the top plate or belly will be joined to complete the structure.

In January 2015, Phil Popham was appointed as the company's new Chief Executive Officer. In June 2019, Sunseeker announced that Andrea Frabetti, formerly Chief Technical Officer at Sunseeker, replaced Christian Marti as CEO. Prior to his time at Sunseeker, Frabetti worked at Italian superyacht manufacturer Ferretti Group for over 25 years, including time as vice president of product development, as well as at Diesel Center SPA as CEO. Marti came on board as Sunseeker‚Äôs CEO in November 2018 following the departure of Phil Popham. Appearance in popular culture Sunseeker boats have featured in the James Bond film series since The World Is Not Enough (1999), chasing up the Thames in the pre-credits sequence, and continued through Die Another Day (2002), Casino Royale (2006) and Quantum of Solace (2008). This latest outing showed Sunseeker's new 37m Yacht and the Superhawk 43; it also featured a cameo role for Sunseeker's then managing director, Robert Braithwaite, in one of Sunseeker's very first open- cockpit speedboats, the Sovereign 17. A BBC Two documentary about the brand, Britain's Biggest Superyachts: Chasing Perfection, shows the building of the Sunseeker 131 yacht. In the feature film Logan, James (Wolverine) is shown trying to secure money to buy a Sunseeker and live with Charles Xavier and Caliban on the ocean.

Carl Ritter advanced the idea of Lebensraum using the metaphor of an organic, growing state. In computer science, organic networks grow in an ad hoc manner, while organic computing is autonomous and able to self-organise and heal. Bionics (biomimicry) is the engineering of technology through the use of systems found in biology. Organic architecture stresses interrelatedness as it combines the site, buildings, furnishings, and surroundings into a unified whole, each adapted to the others. Examples include the use of passive solar and wind energy as elements of design so that the building can be easily adapted to maintain the desired levels of human comfort within the structure. In economics and business, organic growth refers to market growth that has happened gradually, and not through a sudden buyout or acquisition. An organic organisation is one which is flexible and has a flat structure, or one of minimal height. In military, organic refers to mixtures of military unit types.

Formerly a boys' school, girls were admitted from the 2018-19 academic year. Founded in 1955, the school was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, it is sponsored by the Brothers of Holy Cross. There is a 98% college placement rate. The School's team is the Holy Cross Knights and the school's arch athletic rival is the Saint Francis Prep High School Terriers. Since they are both located on Francis Lewis Boulevard approximately apart, when they play each other the game is called the Battle of the Boulevard.  History  The concept of the first all-boys Catholic high school in Queens was born on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in the early 1940s out of a friendship between Msgr. Edmund Reilly, pastor of St. Thomas Aquinas Church (Flatlands) and Rev. Frederick Schulte, CSC. The Brothers of Holy Cross were invited to staff the Boys' Department of St. Thomas Aquinas in 1944 and St. Francis of Assisi in 1947. Within two months after coming to St. Thomas Aquinas, the Brothers were invited to establish a high school in the Bayside West section of Queens. In September 1955, ten years after the initial plans were drawn, Holy Cross High School officially opened in the still incomplete building. The support of interested parents and friends contributed greatly to the success of the school. With the first graduating class of 460 in June 1959, the school was well on its way to becoming the fine institution it is today. One of Holy Cross' first storied athletic teams was their inaugural 1955 football team created by Coaches Gerry Begley and Bill Stetter. Coach Begley was a standout high school QB and was the back-up QB for the 1947 Notre Dame Heisman Award- winning QB John Lujack. While at Notre Dame, Begley played under legendary Coach Frank Leahy in the late 1940s winning 3 National Championships. This 1955 HC football team was only the beginning of a football program that would quickly reach nationally recognized prominence and produce many highly touted college recruits. Coach Begley was succeeded by Coach Guido Maiola and then the highly respected and successful football Coach Robert Griffin who would guide HC to their 1963 (1st school championship) and 1965 New York City championships before becoming the head coach for Idaho State, the University of Rhode Island, and QBs Coach/Offensive Coordinator of the College of the Holy Cross. Holy Cross began as a comprehensive high school offering college preparatory courses in addition to conducting programs in industrial arts and general studies. It is now entirely college prep, with about 98% of its graduates continuing their higher education in schools throughout the country. It was during the McGovern tenure (75-81) that the governance structure of the school was changed from a completely religious (CSC) board of trustees to a two-pronged board structure consisting of an ownership (Congregation of Holy Cross) board working in collaboration with a lay board of Directors (Executive Committee) appointed by the ownership group. This structure was deemed nationally as an important innovation and has since been replicated by numerous religious congregations which run schools. For many years McGovern promoted this structure annually at the convention of the National Catholic Educational Association where he also served in later years as National Public Policy Research Associate. The school became co-ed starting in fall 2018.  Academics  Holy Cross has always been a college preparatory school. When the school was first opened, they had an industrial arts program which included a print shop which printed, among other things, the school newspaper \\"The Lance\\". This program was discontinued during the principalship of Brother Aubert Harrigan, C.S.C. in favor of expanding the mission and purpose of the school as a more \\"college prep\\" environment. A New York State Education Department official remarked to John McGovern, during his principalship (1975‚Äì1981), that the industrial arts program at Holy Cross \\"in the early days\\" distinguished the school in a national profile of Catholic secondary schools in the United States. It was during the McGovern tenure that the school reached its highest enrollment (1400+); it was also during this period that the school reached its first milestone anniversary celebration of 25 years (1955‚Äì1980)and commenced its first pursuit of regional accreditation by The Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges and which was brought to completion during the early tenure of James Lembo the school's sixth principal. The school is well known for its Community Service Program and McGovern proudly accepted from NEWSDAY the designation of High School of the Year in 1979 in recognition of the hundreds of weekly hours of service which the senior class of 225 gave to parishes, community programs and most notably St. Mary's Children's Hospital in Bayside. The Office of Alumni Relations was founded in 1977 just in time to celebrate the 20th year reunion of the school's first graduating class (1959) and thereafter the 25th anniversary of the founding of the school (1955) with celebrations which included all of the school's and local churches constituent groups. Graduates have attended such institutes as Cornell University, West Point, Howard University, Villanova University, Binghamton University, Boston College, University of New Hampshire, Notre Dame, Fordham, Catholic University of America, Harvard, and Columbia University.  Religious life  Besides athletics, Holy Cross offers many intellectual pursuits such as, but not limited to: Campus Ministry, Student Government, and the National Honor Society (NHS). The Holy Cross Brothers still staff the school in various capacities; however as a result of governance changes instituted during the McGovern tenure in collaboration with provincial leadership, the school is operating under a \\"sponsorship\\" model with the Brothers of Holy Cross constituting the ownership board and a local Board of Directors constituting the management board. The religious philosophy is based on the mission of The Brothers of Holy Cross which were founded in Le Mans, France in 1835.

The narratives occur in Genesis 12, 20 and 26. At the core of each is the story of a biblical patriarch who has come to be in the land of a powerful foreign overlord who misidentifies the Patriarch's wife as the Patriarch's sister, and consequently attempts to wed her himself. The overlord later finds out his error. Two of the three stories are similar in many other details, including the ruler's name, Abimelech. Synopsis of the three narratives Sarai Is Taken to Pharaoh's Palace by James Tissot. Abram and Pharaoh The first episode appears in . Abram (later called Abraham) moves to ancient Egypt in order to evade a famine. Because his wife and half-sister, Sarai (later called Sarah), is very beautiful, Abram asks her to say that she was only his sister lest the Egyptians kill him so that they can take her. On arriving before the Pharaoh, the Egyptians recognise Sarai's beauty, and the Egyptian princes shower Abram with gifts of livestock and servants to gain her hand in marriage. Sarai thus becomes part of \\"Pharaoh's house\\", but Yahweh sends a plague. Pharaoh restores Sarai to Abram and orders them to leave Egypt with all the possessions Abram had acquired in Egypt. Abraham and Abimelech narrates the story of Abraham emigrating to the southern region of Gerar, whose king is named Abimelech. Abraham states that Sarah, his wife, is really his sister, leading Abimelech to try to take Sarah as a wife; however, God intervened before Abimelech touched Sarah. Abimelech complains to Abraham, who states that Sarah is his half-sister. Abimelech rebuking Abraham by Wenceslas Hollar. Abimelech asks Abraham, \\"What has thou done unto us?\\" Abimelech then restores Sarah to Abraham, and gives him gifts of livestock and servants by way of apology, and also allows Abraham to reside anywhere in Gerar. Abimelech also gives 1000 pieces of silver to Abraham to reprove Sarah by a \\"covering of the eyes\\". Abraham then prays for Abimelech and the king and his wife and concubines are able to conceive children; they previously could not. Isaac and Abimelech The third episode appears in . Here it is Isaac who, in order to avoid a famine, emigrates to the southern region of Gerar, whose king is named Abimelech. Isaac has been told to do so by God, who also orders him to avoid Egypt, and promises to him the fulfillment of the oath made with Abraham. Isaac states that Rebekah, his wife, is really his sister, as he is worried that the Philistines will otherwise kill him in order to marry Rebekah. After a while, Abimelech sees Isaac sporting (Hebrew mitsahek) with Rebekah and states that she must be Isaac's wife rather than his sister. Isaac and Abimelech Swear Friendship. This occurred at Beersheba. Abimelech then orders that Rebekah be left alone by the denizens of Gerar, on pain of death. Isaac goes on to spend a year in the area, and becomes wealthy, leading the Philistines in Gerar to envy him, so Abimelech sends Isaac away. Historical-critical analysis of the narratives The Jewish Encyclopedia's article \\"Sarah\\" notes that According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, the recurring story has a unified purpose: Comparison to other cultures Political marriages were common occurrences in the Ancient Near East, which typically meant that a resident alien would offer one of his daughters to the monarch as a diplomatic action and to protect himself and his family. James Hoffmeier interprets the wife-sister narratives found in the Book of Genesis as reflecting that practice; in his view Abraham and Isaac were traveling in foreign territory without any daughters to offer the local ruler and attempted to create similar diplomatic relationships by presenting their wives as potential gifts.Hoffmeier, James K. The Wives' Tales of Genesis 12, 20, & 26 and the Covenants at Beer-Sheba. Source criticism From the perspective of source criticism, these three accounts would appear to be variations on the same theme, with the oldest explication being that in Gen. 12.Pdf. In the past, the first and third accounts have been attributed to the Yahwist source (or J source), and the second account has been attributed to the Elohist source (or the E source) via source criticism. However, it has also been proposed that similarities between these narratives is because they are oral variations of one original story. Recently, it has been thought that the second and third accounts were based on and had knowledge of the first account. According to critics, such as T.D. Alexander, there are different theories about the sources but none can be proven to be flawless. Literary analysis Scholars have also argued that the three tales are not true historic occurrences, rather purposeful tales. According to Susan Niditch, there is one wife-sister story that has many different versions, but there are inconsistencies and they all refer back to the same story. Niditch associates the wife-sister entries as potential folklore written to target a particular audience and in hopes of conveying a message regarding the sinful nature of deception and adultery. The three wife- sister narratives are all related to each other in some way, according to George Coats, sharing common content, structure and genre for communicating the content. In all three stories a promise for progeny is not a factor in the content and the structure rather the narratives have a focus on blessing. The wife and sister relationships Gershon Hepner concludes, through biblical exegesis and semantics, that it is plausible that the union of Abraham and Sarah was actually incestuous with Sarah being Abraham's half- sister. For example, in Genesis 20: 13, Abraham, talking to Abimelech, alludes to Leviticus laws or the Holiness code, by using the phrase \\"lovingkindness.\\" The same word is found referring to the sin of incestuous relationships and can also take the alternative meaning of \\"disgrace.\\" Abraham, in his discourse with Abimelech, could be openly confessing his \\"disgraceful\\" relations with his wife/sister Sarah but whichever translation of the word is taken, it shows Abraham's knowledge of the Holiness code and specifically the clauses pertaining to incest found within Leviticus.Hepner, Gershon (2003). Abraham's Incestuous Marriage with Sarah a Violation of the Holiness Code. Los Angeles: Koninklijke Bril NV. pp. 144‚Äì155.  Jewish and Christian interpretations  An explanation presented in classical times, and suggested by Rashi, argued that when a stranger comes to town, the proper thing to do would be to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham to the fact that there is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Consequently, it could be argued that the parallel behaviour results from this lack of fear of God by the antagonists in the other two similar situations. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, in the same sense perhaps as Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery. On the other hand, commentators such as Allan Turner, in his essay \\"Lying: Is It Ever Right?\\", takes the standpoint that the patriarchal individuals did not actually lie, but merely concealed part of the truth.

Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. Prior to his election as President in 2000, Bush held numerous other positions, including being an oil executive, an owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, and Governor of Texas. (Also see Governorship of George W. Bush.) Business Bush began his industry career in 1977, when he established Arbusto Energy, an oil and gas exploration company he financed with his education trust fund surplus and money from other investors, including Dorothy Bush, Lewis Lehrman, William Henry Draper III, Bill Gammell, and James R. Bath, the last of whom represented Salem bin Laden, a half-brother and cousin of Osama bin Laden. In 1984, Bush sold the company, heavily damaged due to the 1979 energy crisis, to Spectrum 7, another Texas gas exploration firm. Under the terms of the sale, Bush became CEO. Spectrum 7 lost revenue and was merged into Harken Energy Corporation in 1986, with Bush becoming a director of Harken. Texas Rangers and allegations of insider trading After working on his father's successful 1988 presidential campaign, Bush learned from fellow Yale alumnus William DeWitt, Jr., that family friend Eddie Chiles wanted to sell the Texas Rangers baseball franchise along with the new sports stadium; built on land acquired under eminent domain law and built under funding financed through taxpayers' funds backed by a bond issued for its debt. In April 1989, Bush assembled a group of investors from his father's close friends, including fellow fraternity brother Roland W. Betts; the group bought an 86% share of the Rangers for $75 million. Bush received a 2% share by investing $606,302, of which $500,000 was a bank loan. Against the advice of his counsel, Bush repaid the loan by selling $848,000 worth of stock in Harken Energy. Harken reported significant financial losses within a year of this sale, triggering allegations of insider trading. On March 27, 1992, the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Bush had a \\"preexisting plan\\" to sell, that Bush had a \\"relatively limited role in Harken management\\", and that it had not seen evidence of insider trading. The subsequent SEC investigation ended in 1992 with a memo stating \\"it appears that Bush did not engage in illegal insider trading,\\" but noted that the memo \\"must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result\\". Critics allege that this decision was strongly influenced by the makeup of the SEC at the time, which heavily favored Bush. The chairman at the time was Richard Breeden, a good friend of the Bush family's who had been nominated to the SEC by President George H. W. Bush and who had been a lawyer in James Baker's firm, Baker Botts. The SEC's general counsel at the time was James Doty, who had been appointed by President H.W. Bush and as a lawyer in James Baker's firm, Baker Botts had represented George W. Bush when arrangements were made to acquire the Texas Rangers baseball franchise (although Doty recused himself from the investigation.). With Baker Botts representing W. Bush, the Saudi BinLaden family, and W. Bush's funding conduit James R. Bath, Doty was involved in the frivolous litigation campaign launched in the attempt to intimidate BinLaden middleman James R Bath's business partner Charles W. [\\"Bill\\"] White into cooperating with the attempted cover-up of secret BinLaden Family funding of W. Bush's campaigns and businesses. Bush's own lawyer was Robert Jordan, who had been \\"partners with both Doty and Breeden at Baker Botts and who later became George W. Bush's ambassador to Saudi Arabia\\". In House of Bush, House of Saud, Craig Unger notes that at the time of Bush's sale, Harken Energy \\"was expected to run out of money in just three days\\" (p. 123). In a last-ditch attempt to save the company, Harken was advised by the endowment fund of Harvard University to spin off two of its lower-performing divisions. \\"According to a Harken memo, if the plan did not go through, the company had 'no other source of immediate financing.'\\" Bush had already taken out a $500,000 loan and sought Harken's general counsel for advice. The reply was explicit: \\"The act of trading, particularly if close in time to the receipt of the inside information, is strong evidence that the insider's investment decision was based on the inside information... the insider should be advised not to sell\\". This memo was turned over by Bush's attorney the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that it would not charge Bush with insider trading. On June 22, Bush sold his 212,140 shares of stock anyway for a net profit of $848,560. The very next quarter, Harken announced losses of $23 million, which continued to the end of the year when the stock \\"plummeted from $4 to $1.25\\". As President, Bush has refused to authorize the SEC to release its full report on the Harken investigation. When the Rangers franchise was sold for $250 million in 1998, at a total profit of $170 million, Bush personally received $14.9 million for his $600,000 investment.http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol17/issue19/pols.bush.html As managing general partner of the Rangers, Bush assisted the team's media relations and the construction of a new stadium. Many in Arlington protested that the stadium was paid for with public funds, and when the stadium title was given to the Texas Rangers Organization, it effectively allowed Bush to cash out public funds. His public role generated valuable goodwill and reinforced name recognition throughout Texas. Early political career After a United States National Guard transfer in 1972, he served as political director for an Alabama senate campaign[citation needed]. In 1978, Bush ran for the U.S. House of Representatives but lost to Kent Hance. Bush stressed his energy credentials and conservative values in the campaign. Hance, however, also held many conservative views, opposing gun control and strict regulation; he successfully portrayed Bush as out of touch with rural Texans. Hance later became a Republican and donated money to Bush's campaign for Governor of Texas in 1993. See also * George W. Bush ‚Äî main article * George W.

He is currently the pitching coach at Napa Valley College. Brusstar was inducted into the Napa Valley College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011 Amateur career Brusstar, who batted and threw right-handed, graduated from Napa High School in 1970, and was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 27th round (635th overall) of the 1970 MLB Draft. He chose not to sign, and played college baseball at Fresno State University. In 1971, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Giants again in the 1971 MLB Draft, this time in the sixth round (114th overall). Again, the , 200 pound Brusstar did not sign. He would have to wait until the 1973 MLB Draft to be selected again, this time by the New York Mets in the 33rd round (684th), but again did not sign. In the 1974 MLB Draft, the Phillies were able to sign Brusstar after drafting him in the fourth round (67th). Minor leagues Brusstar was a very successful starter and reliever in the minor leagues. His ERA never reached 3.00 in any of the years he played before making his major league debut (the highest it reached was 2.71), although in two seasons he walked 90 or more batters. Major Leagues On May 6, 1977, at the age of 25, Brusstar made his major league debut with the Phillies when he was called up to replace Tug McGraw on the team's roster after McGraw suffered an elbow injury. He would never start a game in his career, because he was used primarily as a middle reliever. In only three seasons did Brusstar appear in over 50 games in a season, because he was constantly hampered by elbow and shoulder problems. However, he did win a World Series title in 1980 as a member of the Phillies. He played his last game on October 3, 1985. Transactions On August 30, 1982, the Chicago White Sox purchased Brusstar from the Phillies. He would end up only pitching ten games for the White Sox. On January 25, 1983, the Chicago White Sox made a trade sending Brusstar and Steve Trout to the Cubs for Scott Fletcher, Pat Tabler, Randy Martz, and Dick Tidrow. Bill Buckner, who also graduated from Napa High School, was a teammate with Brusstar for a year and a half while they played for the Cubs.

The school underwent a $3.5 million renovation in 2005. A renovated Gerald Finsen Media Center was built during the 2005‚Äì06 school year. The school is now renamed Holy Cross Preparatory Academy. History The archdiocese proposed closing the school circa 2018, but instead an alumni group agreed to take management of the school. Prior to 2018 the archdiocese spent about $500,000 each year to keep the school in operation; the school remained open since the alumni were able to collect that much in donations for the year. The name changed to Holy Cross Preparatoy Academy that year. Extracurricular activities About 95% of the student body is involved in some type of extracurricular activity. In 2006, Holy Cross created a new, redesigned Dance Team program with a custom dance studio that was completed that summer. Holy Cross features three annual drama events: a fall play, a Christmas production, and a spring musical. The 2008-09 lineup included Noises Off in October 2008, A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, in December 2008 and a spring musical that runs in April.

The soil is rich in limestone and calcium carbonate and also contains a significant amount of decomposed granite. This soil has a mineral composition similar to Champagne, which is located within the Bourgogne region of France. Chalone is situated in an arid chaparral environment, in which temperatures can vary as much as 50¬∞F in one day. The climate is very dry, only 12 to of rain fall per year. These factors combine to create a unique terroir, the signature profile of a wine growing region.  History  The original vineyard was planted in the 1890s by a Frenchman, Charles L. Tamm, who thought the soil similar to that in Burgundy. In 1964, the property was purchased by new owners with a commitment to producing fine wine. Under the guidance of California wine pioneer Richard H. Graff, the vineyard expanded when new vineyards were planted and the winery was moved from a converted chicken shed to a bigger location adjacent to where a newer (and much larger) winery stands today. Graff wanted to establish a Burgundian-Style, top-flight Chardonnay, and with his brothers, John Graff and Peter Watson-Graff, began producing some of the earliest barrel-fermented and aged wines in the United States. In addition to introducing California to oak barrels, Graff brought to California the process of malolactic fermentation in white wines. In 1971 he was joined by Phillip Woodward and the two began what would later become the Chalone Wine Group. The finishing of Chardonnays with oak barrel fermentation/ aging and the addition of the malolactic process makes the Chards similar to the Bourgogne rule book. Chalone Vineyard achieved third rank out of ten from France and the U.S. in the historic Judgment of Paris wine competition. All 11 judges awarded their top scores to either Chalone Vineyard or Chateau Montelena, also of California. Chalone grew and prospered first with Richard Graff and brothers John and Peter Watson-Graff, then Michael Michaud as winemaker. During this time the Chalone Wine Group expanded to include six wineries in California and two in Washington. Chalone Wine Group also owned about 24% of the Chateau Duhart-Milon estate in France. In 2005, Chalone Wine Group was purchased by beverage giant Diageo. In early 2016 it was sold to Foley Family Wines. Today, Chalone Vineyard produces Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc, Chenin blanc, Syrah, Grenache and Grenache Rose.

Sulphur dioxide kills lichens, leaving tree bark bare where in clean areas it is boldly patterned, while soot darkens bark and other surfaces. Darker pigmented individuals have a higher fitness in those areas as their camouflage matches the polluted background better; they are thus favoured by natural selection. This change, extensively studied by Bernard Kettlewell, is a popular teaching example in Darwinian evolution, providing evidence for natural selection. Kettlewell's results have been challenged by zoologists, creationists and the journalist Judith Hooper, but later researchers have upheld Kettlewell's findings. Industrial melanism is widespread in the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), involving over 70 species such as Odontopera bidentata (scalloped hazel) and Lymantria monacha (dark arches), but the most studied is the evolution of the peppered moth, Biston betularia. It is also seen in a beetle, Adalia bipunctata (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous warning coloration, and in the seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus where the melanism may help in excretion of trace elements through sloughing of the skin. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution, in effect a natural experiment, makes natural selection for camouflage \\"the only credible explanation\\". Other explanations for the observed correlation with industrial pollution have been proposed, including strengthening the immune system in a polluted environment, absorbing heat more rapidly when sunlight is reduced by air pollution, and the ability to excrete trace elements into melanic scales and feathers. History Intermediate insularia form (between pale typica and dark carbonaria in tone) of peppered moth on a lichen-covered birch tree: Bernard Kettlewell counted the frequencies of all three forms. Industrial melanism was first noticed in 1900 by the geneticist William Bateson; he observed that the colour morphs were inherited, but did not suggest an explanation for the polymorphism. In 1906, the geneticist Leonard Doncaster described the increase in frequency of the melanic forms of several moth species from about 1800 to 1850 in the heavily industrialised north-west region of England. In 1924, the evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane constructed a mathematical argument showing that the rapid growth in frequency of the carbonaria form of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, implied selective pressure. Originally published in Trans Camb Phil Soc 23: 19‚Äì41. From 1955 onwards, the geneticist Bernard Kettlewell conducted a series of experiments exploring the evolution of melanism in the peppered moth. He used a capture-mark-recapture technique to show that dark forms survived better than light ones. By 1973, pollution in England had begun to decrease, and the dark carbonaria form had declined in frequency. This provided convincing evidence, gathered and analysed by Kettlewell and others such as the entomologist and geneticist Michael Majerus and the population geneticist Laurence M. Cook, that its rise and fall had been caused by natural selection in response to the changing pollution of the landscape. Taxonomic range Industrial melanism is known from over 70 species of moth that Kettlewell found in England, and many others from Europe and North America., which cites Kettlewell 1973. Among these, Apamea crenata (clouded border brindle moth) and Acronicta rumicis (knot grass moth) are always polymorphic, though the melanic forms are more common in cities and (like those of the peppered moth) are declining in frequency as those cities become less polluted. Among other insects, industrial melanism has been observed in a beetle, Adalia bipunctata, the two-spot ladybird. In the vertebrates, industrial melanism is known from the turtle-headed seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus, and may be present in urban feral pigeons. Camouflage Originally, peppered moths lived where light-colored lichens covered the trees. For camouflage from predators against that clean background, they had generally light coloration. During the Industrial Revolution in England, sulphur dioxide pollution in the atmosphere reduced the lichen cover, while soot blackened the bark of urban trees, making the light-colored moths more vulnerable to predation. This provided a selective advantage to the gene responsible for melanism, and the darker- colored moths increased in frequency. The melanic phenotype of Biston betularia has been calculated to give a fitness advantage as great as 30 per cent. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely replaced the original light-coloured type (var. typica), forming a peak of 98% of the population in 1895. Tree bark covered in shrubby and leafy lichens forms a patterned background against which non-melanic disruptively patterned moth camouflage is effective. Melanic B. betularia have been widely observed in North America. In 1959, 90% of B. betularia in Michigan and Pennsylvania were melanic. By 2001, melanism dropped to 6% of the population, following clean air legislation. The drop in melanism was correlated with an increase in species diversity of lichens, a decrease in the atmospheric pollutant sulphur dioxide, and an increase in the pale phenotype. The return of lichens is in turn directly correlated with the reduction in atmospheric sulphur dioxide. An additional study in 2018 further quantified survivability by looking at color and luminance camouflauge and avian artificial predation models. For color camouflage, typica moths blended better under lichen bark than carbonaria, but when placed under plain bark, there was no significant difference. However, in luminance camouflauge, carbonaria moths blended better compared to typica on a plain bark tree. When both variants were placed on an unpolluted lichen covered tree, typica moths had a 21% better survival rate. Controversy Kettlewell's experiments were criticised by the zoologist Theodore David Sargent, who failed to reproduce Kettlewell's results between 1965 and 1969, and argued that Kettlewell had specially trained his birds to give the desired results. Michael Majerus however found that Kettlewell was basically correct in concluding that differential bird predation in a polluted environment was the primary cause of industrial melanism in the peppered moth. The story was in turn taken up in a 2002 book Of Moths and Men, by the journalist Judith Hooper, asserting that Kettlewell's findings were fraudulent. The story was picked up by creationists who repeated the assertions of fraudulence. Zoologists including L. M. Cook, B. S. Grant, Majerus and David Rudge however all upheld Kettlewell's account, finding that each of Hooper's and the creationists' claims collapsed when the facts were examined. It has been suggested that the demonstrated relationship between melanism and pollution can not be fully proven because the exact reason for increase in survivability can not be tracked and pin-pointed. However, as air quality has improved in industrial areas of America and Britain, through improved regulation, offering the conditions for a natural experiment, melanism has sharply declined in moths including B. betularia and Odontopera bidentata. Cook and J. R. G. Turner have concluded that \\"natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline\\", and other biologists working in the area concur with this judgement. Alternative explanations=Immunity In 1921, the evolutionary biologist Richard Goldschmidt argued that the observed increase in the melanic form of the black arches moth, Lymantria monacha, could not have been caused by mutation pressure alone, but required a selective advantage from an unknown cause: he did not consider camouflage as an explanation. Nearly a century later, it was suggested that the moth's industrial melanism might, in addition (pleiotropy) to providing camouflage with \\"the well-known protective dark coloration\\", also confer better immunity to toxic chemicals from industrial pollution. The darker forms have a stronger immune response to foreign objects; these are encapsulated by haemocytes (insect blood cells), and the capsule so formed is then hardened with deposits of the dark pigment, melanin. Trace metal excretion A non-camouflage mechanism has been suggested for some vertebrates. In tropical ocean regions subject to industrial pollution the turtle-headed seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus is more likely to be melanic. These snakes shed their skin every two to six weeks. Sloughed skin contains toxic minerals, higher for dark skin, so industrial melanism could be selected for through improved excretion of trace elements. The same may apply in the case of urban feral pigeons, which have the ability to remove trace metals such as zinc to their feathers. However, toxic lead was not found to accumulate in feathers, so the putative mechanism is limited in its range. Thermal advantage Melanic forms of the two-spot ladybird Adalia bipunctata are very frequent in and near cities, and rare in unpolluted countryside, so they appear to be industrial. Ladybirds are aposematic (with conspicuous warning coloration), so camouflage cannot explain the distribution. A proposed explanation is that the melanic forms have a thermal advantage directly linked to the pollution aspect of industrialization, since smoke and particulates in the air reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the habitats of these species. Melanic phenotypes should then be favoured by natural selection, as the dark coloration absorbs the limited sunlight better. A possible explanation might be that in colder environments, the thermal advantages of industrial melanism might increase activity and the likelihood to mate. In the Netherlands, melanic A. bipunctata had a distinct mating advantage over the non-melanic form. However, thermal melanism failed to explain the distribution of the species near Helsinki where the city forms a relatively warm 'heat island', while near the Finnish coast there is more sunlight as well as more melanism, so the selective pressure driving melanism requires a different explanation. A study in Birmingham similarly found no evidence of thermal melanism but a strong correlation with smoke pollution; melanism declined from 1960 to 1978 as the city became cleaner. Further, the same study found that a related species, Adalia decempunctata, experienced no change in frequency of melanism in the same places in that period.

Housing the Indiana General Assembly, the office of the Governor of Indiana, the Indiana Supreme Court, and other state officials, it is located in the state capital of Indianapolis at 200 West Washington Street. Built in 1888, it is the fifth building to house the state government. The first state house, located in Corydon, Indiana, is still standing and is maintained as a state historic site. The second building was the old Marion County courthouse which was demolished and replaced in the early 20th century. The third building was a structure modeled on the Parthenon, but was condemned in 1877 because of structural defects and razed so the current statehouse could be built on its location. History=First State House first capitol building in downtown Corydon When Indiana became a state in 1816, the capital was located in Corydon. The first capitol building was a humble, two- story limestone building constructed in 1813 to house the legislature of the Indiana Territory. The building was constructed by a company owned by Dennis Pennington, a member of the early territorial legislature. Construction cost $1,500, paid for by the citizens of Harrison County, and was completed in three years. It measured forty-feet square with walls two-feet-thick and ten- foot ceilings. The building was made of limestone cut from a nearby quarry and, at the time of its completion, was one of the largest buildings in the state.Dunn, p. 295 The capitol contained three rooms and quickly became too small for the state government, which had to erect additional office buildings across the street for the state's administration. The lower floor of the statehouse was used by the Indiana House of Representatives. The upper floor was split into two rooms, one for the Indiana State Senate and another for the Indiana Supreme Court, with a narrow hall between them. The building was abandoned as the capitol in 1824 and was given to Harrison County to use as a courthouse. The old capitol building is still preserved and is now a state historic site.Dunn, pp. 309-310 Second State House When the state government relocated to Indianapolis in December 1824, the government was housed in the Marion County Courthouse. The courthouse had been constructed with state funds in 1822 after Indianapolis was chosen as the site for the new capitol. The courthouse served as the state capitol building for twelve years. At the time Indianapolis was a frontier site, nearly from the nearest settlement of significance, making large scale construction impractical.Dunn, pp. 367-370 The relocation to Indianapolis was an arduous task. At the time it was an eleven-day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital. To complicate matters, no road existed and a path for the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long caravan moved north. The caravan was large because it contained the state treasury, state library, state records, the furniture of the General Assembly, Supreme Court, and Executive Offices, along with a whole host of other implements to aid the caravan on its long journey. Colonel Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move. Ultimately, it took more than a month to relocate the government to Indianapolis. The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825. Third State House Indiana's third State House had a design inspired by the Parthenon In 1831, the Indiana General Assembly approved construction of a new State House. The building was to be funded by the sale of lots of land in Indianapolis. A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $150 prize to the architect who could design the best state house. The firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design. Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon. The building looked very much like the Parthenon except for a large central dome. Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building, and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835. The State House was built of blue limestone, two stories high. The governor and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building was the site of many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Fourth State House When the third State House was condemned in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated to a large office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building was used as the state house during the interim period that the new state house was being built. In 1887, before the new state house had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government to move out of the cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.Gray, p. 223 Current State House=Construction Map of the State House from the State House Guide Book. The State House as it appeared in 1908. Indiana Historical Marker at the current State House. Interior of the State House's rotunda. With Indiana's rapid increase of population during the middle of the 19th century, the state's government increased in size, causing the previous capitol building to become crowded. In 1865, a state office building had to be constructed to house some of the burgeoning government, and the Supreme Court and several bureaus were relocated into the new building.Gray, p. 181 When the state house was condemned in 1877, the state was without a real capitol building, and the administration of Governor James D. Williams proposed the construction of the current state capitol building. The plan was approved by the Indiana General Assembly during the legislative session of 1878. After the third state capitol building had been razed, the new building was constructed on the same site. Two million dollars (USD) were appropriated for construction of the new building, and it was completed in 1888. Governor Williams, who was famed for his frugality, was able to complete the project for $1.8 million and returned the extra $200,000 to the general fund.Gray, p. 184 A team of commissioners, including former Civil War general and civil engineer Thomas A. Morris, planned and oversaw the project. The structure was designed by Edwin May, an Indianapolis architect. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes made in the construction of the previous statehouse, the legislature required the new capitol to be built on a solid foundation so that it would last for many decades. Construction began in 1880 and the cornerstone was laid on September 28. Edwin May died in February of that year, and Adolph Sherrer supervised the project for the entire construction period. The interior was modeled in the Italian Renaissance style. Wherever possible, materials native to Indiana were used. Doors were made of Indiana oak, and Indiana limestone was used throughout the structure. The building's cornerstone is a ten-ton block of limestone quarried in Spencer, Indiana. The central dome was completed in 1883. The building was also wired for electricity, even though Indianapolis did not yet have an electrical power grid. In 1887, the new capitol was sufficiently finished for the first legislative session to be held there. Construction ultimately endured eight years, and the building was finally completed in October 1888. With the pinnacle of the building reaching high, it was the second-tallest building in the state at the time of its completion.Statehouse Guidebook, p. 16 A hole was bored in the cornerstone, and a time capsule was placed inside containing forty-two items. The items included annual reports from all the government agencies, a Bible, samples of several varieties of crops grown in Indiana, several new coins, local maps and newspapers, a book on the history of Indianapolis, and pamphlets from many of the city's institutions. The building is designed in the shape of a cross. A large central rotunda with a glass domed ceiling connects the four wings. The structure is four stories high. The first floor houses the executive offices of the administration. Offices for the Indiana House of Representatives are on the second floor's east side, while those for the Indiana State Senate are on the second floor's west side. Offices of the Indiana Supreme Court are on the north end of the second floor.State House Guidebook, p. 9-10 The seventy- thousand volume Supreme Court Law Library is located on third floor. The third floor also holds the House, Senate, and Supreme Court chambers, and the fourth floor holds the Indiana Court of Appeals courtroom and the offices of nine of the fifteen judges on the Court. Additional executive office and storage space.State House Guidebook, p. 11-12 The building was constructed for the purpose of holding the entire government of the state. For several decades, all the government bureaus were housed within the building, until the government again outgrew the structure; most of the state's bureaus have gradually been moved out of the building. In front of the State House stands a statue of Oliver Morton, governor of Indiana during the Civil War. Renovation Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in 1988, the year a multi- million dollar renovation began. In 1988, the administration of Governor Robert D. Orr proposed that the Indiana General Assembly renovate the state house as part of \\"Hoosier Celebration '88\\", the year of the building's 100th anniversary. The General Assembly approved, and the building had an extensive, $11 million renovation that continued until 1995. During the renovation process, all of the state house's stonework, consisting of marble, granite, and limestone columns and blocks, was cleaned and polished. All of the building's woodwork was repaired or replaced. Broken glass in the central dome skylight was replaced. The building's lighting was updated with new chandeliers based on the original designs, and most interior walls were repainted. The building was wired for a new data network to make the building ready for 21st-century technology. In 1984, the Indiana State House was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it remains a protected building. The state house is open for public tours during the work week and with limited tours during weekend mornings. Public artworks Located inside and around the State House property are more than 40 works of public art that depict many important individuals and events related to the state of Indiana. The collection spans more than 130 years of artistic activity in a variety of mediums.

Other notable appearances in the film include Randy Quaid as an annoying neighbor, Dana Carvey as a man with multiple personalities hired to drive Pryor's car, Rodney Dangerfield as an embezzling loan officer, musician Morris Day, and WWF wrestler King Kong Bundy as a monstrous mover. The film also stars Stacey Dash, as Arlo's daughter Casey. Plot Arlo Pear (Pryor) is a transportation engineer living in the New Jersey suburbs. One day he goes to work and meets a new female co-worker, and when both of them attempt to enter their keys in the same office doorknob, Arlo guesses what has happened and confronts his boss, Roy Hendersen. He learns that his company has merged with another, and now Arlo is out of a job. He ends the meeting by telling off his boss and in his state of anger, he flips Roy off using his index finger. Arlo's wife Monica tries to defuse the situation by telling her husband that she can get him a job at her father's mustard plant, at least until something better comes along. Knowing a job in his own field would better suit him, Arlo refuses. His attempts to find work are futile until he receives a phone call from another engineering firm, due to Roy's influence. The firm all but hires him over the phone, and Arlo is excited ‚Äì until he finds out that his new job will be in Boise, Idaho. With some hesitation, Arlo takes the job. Arlo breaks the news to his family first over dinner by telling them he has a new job, but holds off on telling them of the move until towards the end of the conversation, prompting angry responses from both his wife and his daughter Casey. The family uses a \\"swear jar\\" to collect cash penalties for the use of obscenities in the house, and Casey puts cash in the jar as she makes her feelings known. Shortly afterwards, Monica retrieves her purse and withdraws a large sum of cash, ordering their twin sons Randy and Marshall to leave the room, implying that her own use of profanity will cost her dearly. However, Monica calms down later that evening and agrees to the move, but Casey is much less willing to concede, even going so far as to sabotage their attempts to sell their home. Casey relents after offering her parents a solution: she will agree to the move if they let her finish out the school year and graduate at her present school. They agree, the house sells, and they make arrangements for her to stay with family friends until then. Monica and Arlo find a suitable house owned by retirees in Boise and agree to buy it, even though the retirees jest with the Pears that they are \\"taking everything with us\\", when referring to the appliances and fixtures in the house. They hire a moving company, but find the moving team shady and decide to go with another company. To their surprise, the same shady movers from the first company show up, revealing to the Pears that they now work for the second company. They hire the initially squeaky-clean Brad Williams to drive Arlo's black Saab 900 to Boise. More disaster follows for the Pears. They arrive in Boise to find their new house stripped of not only its cabinetry and appliances, but its doors, stairs, and swimming pool - revealing that the sellers were indeed serious when they said that they were \\"taking everything with us\\". The movers made an unscheduled stop in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Brad reveals himself to have multiple personality disorder and delivers the Saab in a stripped and wrecked heap. Arlo's job is eliminated on his first day in a highly publicized news conference. To top it all off, his new neighbor is revealed to be the twin brother of Frank Crawford, the shell- shocked Vietnam War veteran who lived next door to them in New Jersey. Like Frank, Cornell Crawford has the same anti-social tendencies as his brother, including mowing his grass with a monstrous contraption powered by a V8 engine. Arlo snaps. He threatens the sellers of his new home with violence if they do not restore it. He tracks down the moving team on the highway and makes short work of them physically after they arrive at his home. He finds his new boss and manages to save his job. He orders Brad to leave after delivering the Saab or face certain death. And when Cornell Crawford gets ready to mow his grass, he is interrupted by Pear, who tells him to put his contraption back in the garage and invest in a \\"human-sized mower\\". As Cornell says \\"who's going to make me\\", he is answered with ferocious barking from Flipper, the Pears' normally hopelessly lazy dog, apparently at the end of his own rope from all the moving mess. Cornell immediately backs off, obviously alarmed, and expresses his admiration for his new neighbors. The film ends with Arlo replying to his new neighbor by flipping him his index finger, and the surprise arrival of Casey, who was tired of being separated from her family and joined them out West.

Biography Tsallis was born in Greece, and grew up in Argentina, where he studied physics at Instituto Balseiro, in Bariloche. In 1974, he received a Doctorat d'√âtat √®s Sciences Physiques degree from the University of Paris-Orsay. He moved to Brazil in 1975 with his wife and daughter. Tsallis is credited with introducing the notion of what is known as Tsallis entropy and Tsallis statistics in his 1988 paper \\"Possible generalization of Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs statistics\\" published in the Journal of Statistical Physics. The generalization is considered to be a good candidate for formulating a theory of non-extensive thermodynamics. The resulting theory is not intended to replace Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs statistics, but rather supplement it, such as in the case of anomalous systems characterised by non-ergodicity or metastable states. One experimental verification of the predictions of Tsallis statistics concerned cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices. Eric Lutz made an analytical prediction in 2003 which was verified in 2006 by a London team. Tsallis conjectured in 1999 (Brazilian Journal of Physics 29, 1; Figure 4): #That a longstanding quasi-stationary state (QSS) was expected in long-range interacting Hamiltonian systems (one of the core problems of statistical mechanics). This was verified by groups around the world. #That this QSS should be described by Tsallis statistics instead of Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs statistics. This was verified in June 2007 by Pluchino, Rapisarda and Tsallis (in the last figure, instead of the Maxwellian (Gaussian) distribution of velocities (valid for short-range interactions), one sees a q-Gaussian).

His father was born in Idstein, near Wiesbaden, in the Duchy of Nassau (now part of Germany), and represented that country in New York as consul general until it was absorbed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. His mother was born in New London, Connecticut, to a prominent New England family. When Gustav Kobb√© was ten years old, he was sent to Wiesbaden to study composition and the piano with Adolf Hagen. Following five years of study in Germany, he returned to New York City for additional study under Joseph Mosenthal. Afterward, he graduated from Columbia College in 1877 and two years later from Columbia Law School. He received his M.A. from Columbia in 1880. In 1882, he married Carolyn Wheeler. He made his career in literary and newspaper work, and contributed articles on musical and dramatic subjects to the leading magazines and periodicals. His hobby was sailing, and it was while he was out in the Great South Bay off Bay Shore, New York, in July 1918, that a seaplane, coming down for a landing, struck his boat and killed him instantly.The Earl of Harewood (Ed.), Kobb√©'s Complete Opera Book.

In March 2006, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) designated Ibarra as its candidate to the Senate via proportional representation to serve during the LX Legislature (2006-2009) and during the LXI Legislature (2009-2012); she won. Personal life Ibarra, who was born in Saltillo, Coahuila, to an agricultural engineer father and a violinist mother. She studied in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, and then met Jes√∫s Piedra Rosales, who would become her husband. She became involved with the community, especially when her son, Jes√∫s Piedra Ibarra, an activist who disappeared on April 18, 1975, in Monterrry, Mexico after the murder of the policeman Guillermo Valdez Villarreal. Jes√∫s was accused of being a member of the communist organization Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre. When her cries for resolution were unheard she formed the Comit√© Eureka de Desaparecidos (\\"The Eureka Committee of the Disappeared\\") with about 100 other women in 1977. As a result of her efforts, including several hunger strikes, 148 out of 557 political prisoners on her lists were liberated during the L√≥pez Portillo administration (1976‚Äì1982). In December 2005, Carlos Solana Mac√≠as was apprehended for the abduction of Rosario's son. Political career In 1982 she became the first woman in Mexico to run for the presidency with the Workers Revolutionary Party (PRT), a Trotskyist party. In 1988, she ran for the presidency a second time, again with the PRT. In 1994 she became a federal deputy of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Senate In March 2006 the PRD designated Ibarra as their candidate to the Senate via proportional representation to serve during the LX Legislature (2006-2009) and during the LXI Legislature (2009-2012); as a result of that designation she was able to secure a seat in the Senate representing the PRD, but in October 2006 she left the PRD faction in the Senate to join the Labor Party (PT) faction as part of a political negotiation between the PRD and the PT. Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor Rosario Ibarra was awarded the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor on October 23, 2019. Speaking through her daughter, Claudia Ibarra, she turned the medal over to President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, saying, Se√±or presidente... no permitas que la violencia y la perversidad de los gobiernos anteriores siga acechando y actuando desde las tinieblas de la impunidad y la ignominia. No quiero que mi lucha quede inconclusa. ...[D]ejo... la custodia de tan preciado reconocimiento y te pido que me la devuelvas junto con la verdad sobre el paradero de nuestros queridos y a√±orados hijos y familiares, y con la certeza de que la justicia anhelada por fin los ha cubierto con su velo protector. (\\"Mr. President... do not let the violence and perversity of the previous governments continue to stalk and act from the darkness of impunity and ignominy. I don't want my fight to be unfinished. ...I leave... the custody of such precious recognition and I ask you to return it to me along with the truth about the whereabouts of our beloved and long-awaited children and family members, and with the certainty that the justice longed for has finally covered with its protective veil.\\") Lopez Obrador promised to do everything humanamente posible (\\"humanly possible\\") to find the missing persons.

The Norman Foster-directed film was one of the few to address the role of women in the pioneer west, as well as portray early America's indentured servant trade. It was based on the Howard Fast short story \\"Rachel\\". While the film had a low budget, it was RKO's most successful film that year, making $395,000. Plot In colonial America, David Harvey (William Holden), a recent widower living in the wilderness, decides that his young boy Davey (Gary Gray) needs a woman around to help raise him. He goes to the nearest settlement and consults Parson Jackson (Tom Tully). David gets talked into buying the contract of an indentured servant named Rachel (Loretta Young) and marrying her. Their marriage, however, is in name alone. Rachel serves more as a servant than a wife and Davey resents what he sees as an attempt to replace his dead mother Susan. Jim Fairways (Robert Mitchum), a family friend (and former suitor of Susan's), visits and falls in love with Rachel. When he offers to buy her, David must fight to keep her and discovers his love in the process.

Due to Earth's rotation and axial tilt with respect to the Sun, the stars and constellations can be divided into two categories. Those stars and constellations that never rise or set are called circumpolar. The rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations. The stars and constellations that are circumpolar depends on the observer's latitude. In the Northern Hemisphere, certain stars and constellations will always be visible in the northern circumpolar sky. The same holds true in the Southern Hemisphere, where certain stars and constellations will always be visible in the southern circumpolar sky. The celestial north pole, currently marked by Polaris less than 1¬∞ away, always has an azimuth equal to zero. The pole's altitude for a given latitude √ò is fixed, and its value is given by the following formula: A = 90¬∞ - √ò. All stars with a declination less than A are not circumpolar. As viewed from the North Pole, all fully visible constellations north of the celestial equator are circumpolar, and likewise for constellations south of the celestial equator as viewed from the South Pole. As viewed from the Equator, no circumpolar constellations are visible. As viewed from mid-northern latitudes (40‚Äì50¬∞ N), circumpolar constellations may include Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and the less-known Camelopardalis.

Today, Freemark Abbey produces Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc, as well as very limited production wines, such as Viognier, Malbec, and Cabernet Franc. Depending on conditions, the winery sometimes makes a late harvest Riesling known as \\"Edelwein Gold\\". History The winery was first built by Josephine Marlin Tychson, one of the first women to build and operate a winery in the state. The winery was originally named Tychson Cellars and it produced Zinfandel, Riesling, and \\"Burgundy\\". Josephine Tychson sold the winery to her foreman Nils Larsen in 1894. Larson in turn leased the property to Antonio Forni and later sold it to him in 1898. Forni renamed the winery Lombarda Cellars after his birthplace; Lombarda Italy. He concentrated his efforts on making Chianti and other Italian style wines which he marketed to the numerous Italians that had moved to Barre, Vermont, the site of America's largest marble and granite quarries. Forni was forced to cease operations when Prohibition began. In 1939, three businessmen from Southern California, Albert \\"Abbey\\" Ahern, Charles Freeman and Markquand Foster purchased Lombarda Cellars. Together they reopened the winery and renamed it Freemark Abbey (a combination which includes a portion of each partner's name). During the 1940s and 1950s the partners sold the majority of their wines to retail outlets in San Francisco. The winery went through several hands in the early 1960s before being purchased by a group of seven partners in 1966. After the purchase, the new owners made major improvements to the facility.Charles A. Carpy, \\"Viticulture and Enology at Freemark Abbey,\\" an oral history conducted in 1993 by Carole Hicke, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley. 1994. https://archive.org/stream/viticultureenology00carprich/viticultureenology00carprich_djvu.txt This core group owned the winery until 2001 when they sold it to The Legacy Estate Group. In March 2005 the Legacy Estate Group overreached and tried to consolidate Arrowood and Byron into one group. Eight months later, in November 2005, the Legacy Estate group went bankrupt and sold its assets in an auction. Freemark Abbey is now a part of Jackson Family Wines, which is owned by the family of the late Jess Jackson. Awards The winery won the New York Wine Tasting of 1973, a wine competition of 23 California, New York, and French Chardonnays.

Located in Jefferson City at 201 West Capitol Avenue, it is the third capitol in the city after the other two were demolished when they were damaged in fires. The domed building, designed by the New York City architectural firm of Tracy and Swartwout, was completed in 1917. The Capitol's dome, which rises above ground level and topped by a bronze statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, rises above the bluffs of the Missouri River and is the first view of Jefferson City for travelers arriving from the north. In addition to the state Senate and House of Representatives, the Capitol also contains offices for the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, and some administrative agencies. It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a contributing property in the Missouri State Capitol Historic District. Architecture, paintings, and statuary Statue of Thomas Jefferson, South Entrance The Missouri State Capitol is notable for its architectural features, including its eight columns on the south portico and its six columns on the north side, its -wide grand stairway; and its bronze front doors, each ‚Äîat the time, the largest cast since the Roman era. Also on the South lawn are The Sciences and The Arts Fountains, each with four representative figures. Statuary is a prominent feature of the Capitol grounds. Heroic allegorical bronze figures depicting Missouri's two historically great rivers‚Äîthe Mississippi and the Missouri‚Äîby Robert Aitken and a tall statue of Thomas Jefferson made by James Earle Fraser all dominate the south entrance. A Karl Bitter bronze relief, depicting the signing of the Louisiana Purchase by Livingston, Monroe and Marbois; and the Fountain of the Centaurs, created by A.A. Weinman; are featured on the north grounds. The north side of the building contains a frieze showing the history of Missouri by Hermon Atkins MacNeil, while the theme is continued on the south side by Alexander Stirling Calder. The figure of Ceres on the top of the dome is by Sherry Fry and the pediment over the main entrance is by Weinman. The Capitol's first floor features the State Museum. Paintings, pediments, and friezes decorate the Capitol's interior. A prime attraction is a series of murals painted by Thomas Hart Benton in the House Lounge. The grand staircase is flanked by large heroic bronze statues of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, and the third-floor rotunda is the site of the Hall of Famous Missourians, a group of bronze busts of many prominent Missourians honored for their achievements and contributions to the state. The structure also features a whispering gallery high within the dome; a small viewing platform is on the dome's roof beneath the statue of Ceres. These areas are not normally open to the public except for special tours and school tours. The Capitol is Jefferson City's leading tourist attraction. It is a destination for school groups who arrive by busloads, particularly during General Assembly sessions. Students fill the galleries to watch the Senate and House of Representatives in action. History of the structure Missouri State Capitol and Fountain of the Centaurs (north side) The present Capitol, completed in 1917 and occupied the following year, is the third Capitol in Jefferson City and the sixth in Missouri history. The first seat of state government was housed in the Mansion House, located at Third and Vine Streets in St. Louis and the second one was in the Missouri Hotel located at Main and Morgan Streets in St. Charles. St. Charles was designated as the temporary capital of the state in 1821 and remained the seat of government until 1826. It was decided that the Capitol should be located more in the center of the state and specifically that it should be located on the Missouri River within of the mouth of the Osage. A group was sent out to survey various locations. The present location on top of the bluffs in Jefferson City was chosen because it afforded the best view of the Missouri River of any place which they had seen within the limits prescribed by the Constitution. The fourth Capitol (the first in Jefferson City) was made out of brick, two stories tall, measured approximately , and took two years to complete. It was built for approximately $18,500 (). It was called the \\"Governor's House and State Capitol.\\" This building burned in 1837. The site is now occupied by the present-day Missouri Governor's Mansion. It was designed by Stephen Hills and modeled on the first Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Hills also designed Academic Hall of the University of Missouri; the six Ionic columns that survived the 1892 fire that destroyed the building are now the campus's landmark columns at the David R. Francis Quadrangle. The fifth Capitol (which was at the current site) was completed in 1840 for approximately $350,000 (), with some claiming that there were bribes and kickbacks. This building also burned on February 5, 1911 when it was struck by lightning. This building was approximately and by 1911, was far too small to meet the needs of the legislators. Missouri Senator William Warner said, \\"I have no tears to shed over the fact that the building has been destroyed as it was totally inadequate and not in keeping with the requirements of our great state.\\" The original budget called for a building to be constructed for $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ), with an additional $500,000 () allocated for site and furnishings. This was approved in general election by the public by a three-to-one margin, however, the state miscalculated on revenue projections, and ended up collecting $4,215,000 (). All of this money was eventually used for the entire project, which is one of the reasons why the sculptures and artwork are of such high caliber. Edwin William Stephens of Columbia served as chair of the Capitol Decoration Committee along with University of Missouri art professor John Pickard. It was also decided that the architect would be selected from a design competition; names were redacted from the submissions so that there would be no local favoritism. A total of 69 architecture firms submitted for the competition, from which a short list of 11 was chosen. Tracy & Swarthout from New York was ultimately selected. Missouri State Capitol The building is symmetrical in plan, giving equal symbolic weight to both the House and Senate (though the interiors of the two chambers differ greatly). The style makes many historical references to the Capitol in Washington, D.C., as well as to Greek and Roman temples; however, the typical column capital is a unique variation on the Classic Corinthian Capital, replacing the acanthus leaves with local flora. The stone for the exterior is a dense marble from Carthage, Missouri. Some of the finer details have eroded after 90 years of freeze/thaw cycles. The state has committed monies to study restoration and prevent further deterioration. The building measures five stories high, long, wide in the center, and wide in the wings. The dome is high and the height of the wings is . It includes of floor space. ;Rotunda chandelier incident In November 2006, the dome chandelier, which had been lowered almost to the floor for maintenance, fell the remaining five feet. The chandelier was damaged by the impact and by the ornamental chains that fell on it. It was sent to St. Louis for repairs. Nearly a full year later, the chandelier was returned and raised in the Capitol. The upper lights were also restored, after they had been turned off for four decades due to light damage to the mural above. Created in 1918 by the Guth Lighting Company of St. Louis for a cost of $5,000 (), the chandelier cost $500,000 () to be restored.

They originated in the Hesperian and Amazonian epochs. They are thought to be an outflow channel system, carved by catastrophic floods, and the release of vast quantities of water across the Martian surface. This flooding was probably initiated by tectonic stretching and the formation of a graben, Mangala Fossa, at the channels' head, perhaps breaching a pressurized aquifer trapped beneath a thick \\"cryosphere\\" (layer of frozen ground) beneath the surface.Carr, M. 1979.

The presence of scoured bedrock at the base of the mapped stratigraphy, together with evidence from crater retention ages, suggests that fluvial activity came before lava flows. These alternating periods of aqueous flooding and volcanism are similar to that of other outflow systems on Mars, such as Ravi Vallis and the Kasei Valles.

The latter election came in the midst of Ronald Reagan's landslide reelection victory; Reagan won the district by over 20 points. Edgar ran for the United States Senate in 1986, defeating Auditor General Don Bailey, a former congressman from western Pennsylvania, in the primary, but lost the general election to incumbent Republican Senator Arlen Specter by more than 12 percentage points. It is this experience that led Edgar to become frustrated with political campaigning and money in politics, even taking a somewhat sympathetic and supportive stance on clean elections and campaign finance reform, which he dictated at the 2004 Democracy Matters Conference in Albany, New York. Claremont School of Theology In 1990, Edgar began a ten-year term of service as President of Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California, a graduate-professional school related to the United Methodist Church and part of the Claremont educational consortium east of Los Angeles. He is credited with bringing the school from financial distress into a stable and successful period of growth. National Council of Churches In 2000, Edgar began a seven-year term as chief executive of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA. Under his leadership, the 50-year-old NCC began to reshape its mission, focusing its energies on major initiatives in the areas of overcoming poverty, protecting the natural environment, fostering interfaith understanding, and building international peace. Following his retirement from the NCC, he served six years as President of Common Cause, from 2007 until his death in 2013. Additional positions Edgar served on the boards of several organizations, including Independent Sector, the National Coalition for Health Care, and the National Religious Partnership for the Environment. He also served on the board of directors of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, an independent, non-profit organization that is a principal resource for Congress on environmental and energy issues. He was an endorser of the Genocide Intervention Network. Honors and awards Edgar was recognized by several national organizations for his work, including by the American Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Taxpayers Union.

Part of the Hiry≈´ no Ken series, it was published in Japan by Culture Brain, and by Natsume in North America and Europe. Its most notable feature was the game's SD mode that featured a character progression system, in which characters advance in levels as they become more experienced, and in which it is possible to collect credits and treasure items to equip characters with. The game received relatively low scores on specialized reviews at the time of its release. It had a sequel a year later, titled S.D. Hiryu no Ken Densetsu. Flying Dragon is also the name of a NES game released by Culture Brain in 1989, which is part of the same series. Characters The game consists of two different fighting modes, though the two share many common characters. SD Version *Ryuhi - This hot-blooded fighter is a leader of warriors and an expert with Kung Fu. Ryuhi's home country is China and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Ryuhi is well known for being the main protagonist of the Hiryu No Ken series, due to the fact that the main storyline of Hiryu No Ken is often focused around him and that he also serves as the leader of the \\"Dragon Warriors\\". *Hayato - This calm, quiet, gifted warrior is familiar with all types of fighting styles. Hayato's home country is Japan and his fighting style is Kobujutsu. Hayato is best known for being Ryuhi's friendly rival and a member of the \\"Dragon Warriors\\". *Shouryu - This supernatural ghost hunter uses ESP. He is currently training in Mexico. Shouryu's home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mix of Martial Arts and Lucha Libre. Shouryu is best known for being a member of the \\"Dragon Warriors\\". It is hinted by their pre-battle quotes that Shouryu and Suzaku know each other from the past. *Suzaku - This mysterious evil man, set on revenge, plans on conquering the world. His home country is the Underworld and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Suzaku is well known for being the right- hand man of Ryumaou, the series' main antagonist. *Wiler - This warrior is strong and reliable. He uses Martial Arts learned in the US Army. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mix of Martial Arts and Amateur Wrestling. Wiler is also known for being a member of the \\"Dragon Warriors\\" *Yuka - A master with \\"Aiki-Jyujyutsu\\" with telekinesis, she can throw any opponent. Yuka's home country is Japan and her fighting style is Jyujyutsu. *Robo no Hana - The Yokozuna of Robot Sumo, who dreams of becoming the best hero in the universe. He has no home country and his fighting style is Robot Sumo. Robot Sumo is held on the distant planet of Dousokui, which probably means that Robo no Hana is an alien visiting Earth. Robo no Hana had originated from the Super Chinese series, in which he appears in Super Chinese Fighter for the Super Famicom. *Powers - The top wrestler of the NCW, he plans on being the strongest in the world. His home county is the United States and his fighting style is Pro Wrestling. His physical appearance makes him resemble the former professional wrestler The Ultimate Warrior. *Bokuchin (unlockable character) - Possibly the most mysterious character of the bunch. His physical appearance makes him look like a doll brought to life. He has no known fighting style, home country, or even his own stage. He also has the most limited moveset of all the characters. Like Robo no Hana, Bokuchin had originated from the Super Chinese series, first appearing in Super Chinese 3 for the Famicom. *Ryumaou (unlockable character) - He is usually the main boss of both the SD and the Virtual modes. He rules the Underworld as the Devil King and is one of the fiercest and dangerous characters in the game. The playable Ryumaou is a clone created by Shin Ryumaou, who is the final boss. *Shin Ryumaou (boss; non-playable) Virtual Version *Ryuhi *Hayato *Shouryu *Red Falcon - This cruel warrior wins by only attacking weak points, like a falcon. Red Falcon's home country is unknown and his fighting style is Kenpo. Red Falcon may actually be Suzaku under a different alias, due to both having similar outfits, similar movesets, the same hair color and even the same scar in their faces. He Takes His Rival To Ryuhi. *Min Min - This elegant female warrior is successor to her father's \\"Kochouken\\". Min Min's home country is China and her fighting style is Kung Fu. Min Min is also a member of the \\"Dragon Warriors\\". *Kate - This elite international police officer is the all U.S.A. Kickboxing champion. Kate's home country is Sweden and her fighting style is Kick Boxing. *Raima - The cyborg ninja acts in secret to destroy the organization of the darkness. Raima's home country is Japan and his fighting style is Ninjutsu. *Gengai - The head of Shourinji and Ryuhi's sensei, he is the ultimate Kung Fu master. Gengai's home country is China and his fighting style is Kung Fu. *Ryumaou (unlockable character) *Shin Ryumaou (boss; non-playable) S.D. Hiryu no Ken Densetsu An updated version of the game, entitled , was released in Japan only, adding more characters (such as Jack, Ryu, and Gofire from the Super Chinese series), items and a new gameplay mode. It also removed the more realistic \\"Virtual Mode\\", favoring the super deformed \\"Quest Mode\\". Playable characters are Ryuhi, Hayato, Min Min, Wiler, Shouryu, Yuka, Suzaku, Powers, Robo No Hana, Bokuchin (unlockable), Jack, Ryu, Raima, E. Quaker, Ellie, Gofire, Ryumaou (unlockable).

It is located between the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces, to the west of Olympus Mons, in the Amazonis and Memnonia quadrangles, centered at . The plain's topography exhibits extremely smooth features at several different lengths of scale.E. R. Fuller and J. W. Head, III, \\"GEOLOGIC HISTORY OF THE SMOOTHEST PLAINS ON MARS (AMAZONIS PLANITIA) AND ASTROBIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS.\\" Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIII (2002). URL accessed 19 April 2006. A large part of the Medusae Fossae Formation lies in Amazonis Planitia. Its name derives from one of the classical albedo features observed by early astronomers, which was in turn named after the Amazons, a mythical race of warrior women. Age and composition Only approximately 100 million years old, these plains provide some of the fewest sedimentary layers impeding viewing of the Martian terrain, and closely resemble the composition of Earth's Iceland. Formed by free-flowing lava across great plains, Amazonis has been described by William Hartmann as a \\"bright dusty volcanic desert crossed by many fresh-looking lava flows.\\"Hartmann, William. A Traveler's Guide to Mars: The Mysterious Landscapes of the Red Planet. Workman Publishing: New York, 2003. Amazonis has become the primary focus of modern research efforts both because of its geological composition and because of its relative youth compared to other Martian regions, which are often hundreds of millions of years older.Hartmann, 275. Hartman writes that the plain closely resembles Iceland's surface, with its \\"strange cobweb-like networks of ridges and crags [on both planets, divide] smoother areas into a pattern something like fragments of a broken plate.\\" Both land masses' shapes have been formed by lava flows from volcanic eruptions, causing both surfaces to be covered by a thick layer of hardened lava. Findings from aerial footage of both Amazonis and Iceland have shown nearly identical terrain patterns, signifying the comparative ages of the two regions.Hartmann, 286. The entire contemporary era on Mars has been named the Amazonian Epoch because researchers originally (and incorrectly) thought Amazonis Planitia to be representative of all Martian plains. Instead, over the past two decades, researchers have realized that the area's youth and extremely smooth surface actually distinguish the area from its neighbors. It is even possible that the area possessed distinctive characteristics when all of Mars was under water.Fuller, E.R. and J.W. Head III (2002), Amazonis Planitia: The role of geologically recent volcanism and sedimentation in the formation of the smoothest plains on Mars. Although the full implications of Amazonis's youth have not yet been determined, the nature of the area (i.e. lack of sedimentary rock) has at least provided researchers evidence that the areas are the most likely to provide future discoveries, and as such, has been proposed as a future site for most NASA landings.Hartmann, 287. Medusae Fossae Formation The Medusae Fossae Formation is a soft, easily eroded deposit that extends for nearly 1,000 km along the equator of Mars. The surface of the formation has been eroded by the wind into a series of linear ridges called yardangs. These ridges generally point in direction of the prevailing winds that carved them and demonstrate the erosive power of Martian winds. The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles,Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars.

Linear ridge networks Linear ridge networks are found in various places on Mars in and around craters.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mangold et al. 2007. Mineralogy of the Nili Fossae region with OMEGA/Mars Express data: 2. Aqueous alteration of the crust. J. Geophys. Res., 112, doi:10.1029/2006JE002835.Mustard et al., 2007.

Dark slope streaks Many places on Mars show dark streaks on steep slopes, such as crater walls. It seems that the youngest streaks are dark and they become lighter with age. Often they begin as a small narrow spot then widen and extend downhill for hundreds of meters. Several ideas have been advanced to explain the streaks. Some involve water,http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_021200.html or even the growth of organisms.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_streaks_030328.html The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust because at more or less regular intervals dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of Mars rovers get covered with dust. The power of the Rovers has been saved many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils that have cleared the panels and boosted the power. So we know that dust falls from the atmosphere frequently.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090217101110.htm It is most generally accepted that the streaks represent avalanches of dust. Streaks appear in areas covered with dust. When a thin layer of dust is removed, the underlying surface appears dark. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical than the Earth's. That is, the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only slight for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in a global dust storm. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. ESP 036956 1895layers.jpgLayers in Gordii Dorsum Region, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. Dark lines are Dark Slope Streaks.

Wellman and starring Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright. The film is based on a 1949 adventure novel of the same name by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. This was Wellman's second adaptation of a Clark novel, the first being The Ox-Bow Incident. Track of the Cat was produced by John Wayne and Robert Fellows for their Wayne/Fellows production company. Plot The squabbling Bridges family spends a harsh winter on their remote ranch in northern California in the early years of the 20th century. Crude and quarrelsome middle brother Curt (Robert Mitchum) bullies his noble, unselfish eldest brother Arthur (William Hopper), while youngest brother Harold (Tab Hunter) endures Curt‚Äôs abuse in browbeaten silence. Their mother (Beulah Bondi) is a bigoted religious zealot and their father (Philip Tonge) is a loquacious, self-pitying drunk. Bitter old maid sister Grace (Teresa Wright) is temporarily gladdened by the arrival of Harold‚Äôs fianc√©, spirited Gwen (Diana Lynn). Their ancient Native American hired hand Joe Sam (Carl Switzer) alerts the family to a panther prowling the hills. Many years before his family was wiped out by a panther. Joe Sam‚Äôs superstitious dread of the panther irritates domineering Curt. Curt and Arthur split up to track the panther while the family tensely awaits their return. Gentle Harold tries to avoid conflict with his parents while Gwen tenderly encourages him to assert his claim to an equal share of the ranch. Although Grace tries to support her youngest brother and his fianc√©, Ma Bridges spews hateful suspicion at Gwen, but she ignores the family‚Äôs histrionics calmly for Harold‚Äôs sake. By the end of the story, the major conflicts have been resolved, but not without tragedy and loss. The remaining characters seem hopeful that their ordeal may have created the basis for a happier future. Cast * Robert Mitchum as Curt Bridges * Teresa Wright as Grace Bridges * Diana Lynn as Gwen Williams * Tab Hunter as Harold Bridges * Beulah Bondi as Ma Bridges * Philip Tonge as Pa Bridges * William Hopper as Arthur Bridges * Carl Switzer as Joe Sam Production The outdoor scenes were filmed on Mount Rainier, Washington and Mitchum regarded shooting in the deep snow and cold as the worst filming conditions he had ever experienced.Lee Server, Robert Mitchum: \\"Baby, I Don't Care\\", St. Martin's Press, 2001, page 259. Director William A. Wellman had always intended to film a black & white movie in color. His idea was that if a movie were to be shot in mostly monochromatic shades, with stark blacks and whites and otherwise mostly very subdued colours that were almost shades of grey, he could use bright colors very sparingly for intense dramatic effect. The photography of William Clothier was designed to highlight black and white and downplay colors. Only key elements like the blue matches, the fire, and Mitchum's red coat stand out. Reception Film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"But, for the most part, Mr. Wellman's big-screen picture seems a heavy and clumsy travesty of a deep matriarchal melodrama or a Western with Greek overtones. And the business of the brother hunting the panther in the great big CinemaScope outdoors, while the family booze and blather in the ranch-house, has the nature of an entirely different show ... This, in the last analysis, is the trouble with the film: it has no psychological pattern, no dramatic point. There's a lot of pretty snow scenery in it and a lot of talk about deep emotional things. But it gets lost in following some sort of pretense.\\"Crowther, Bosley, film review, The New York Times, \\"The Screen in Review; Track of the Cat Is Seen at Paramount\\", December 2, 1954. Accessed: June 30. 2013. More recently film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote positively about the film, \\"A brilliantly realized ambitious dark, brooding Western set in the 1880s in northern California on an isolated snowbound ranch. It is based on the book by Walter van Tilburg Clark, one of whose other books, The Ox-Bow Incident, had also been filmed by William Wellman (The High and the Mighty). The scorching literate script is by A.I. Bezzerides. It has the haunting feel of a Poe work and the primitive savageness of Indian folklore. Cinematographer William H. Clothier bleached out the primary colors and that gave the images the look of a black and white film. The haunting luminous look created was very effective in charging the film with the sub-textual sexual energy that lingers from the hot melodramatics and also giving it an alluring aura of mystery.\\"Schwartz, Dennis, Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, December 24, 2005.

The input is left side, the output with load is right side. The switch is typically a MOSFET, IGBT, or BJT transistor. The buck‚Äìboost converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter that has an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude. It is equivalent to a flyback converter using a single inductor instead of a transformer.The Flyback Converter - Lecture notes - ECEN4517 - Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - University of Colorado, Boulder. Two different topologies are called buck‚Äìboost converter. Both of them can produce a range of output voltages, ranging from much larger (in absolute magnitude) than the input voltage, down to almost zero. ; The inverting topology : The output voltage is of the opposite polarity than the input. This is a switched-mode power supply with a similar circuit topology to the boost converter and the buck converter. The output voltage is adjustable based on the duty cycle of the switching transistor. One possible drawback of this converter is that the switch does not have a terminal at ground; this complicates the driving circuitry. However, this drawback is of no consequence if the power supply is isolated from the load circuit (if, for example, the supply is a battery) because the supply and diode polarity can simply be reversed. When they can be reversed, the switch can be on either the ground side or the supply side. ; A buck (step-down) converter combined with a boost (step-up) converter : The output voltage is typically of the same polarity of the input, and can be lower or higher than the input. Such a non-inverting buck-boost converter may use a single inductor which is used for both the buck inductor mode and the boost inductor mode, using switches instead of diodes,ST AN2389: \\"An MCU-based low cost non-inverting buck-boost converter for battery chargers\\" Motorola Semiconductor. \\"Application note AN954: A Unique Converter Configuration provides step-up/down functions\\". 1985\\\\. \\"... a unique step- up/down configuration can be created ... which still employs a single inductor for the voltage transformation.\\" sometimes called a \\"four-switch buck-boost converter\\", Haifeng Fan. \\"Wide VIN and High-Power Challenges with Buck-Boost Converters\\". 2015\\\\. it may use multiple inductors but only a single switch as in the SEPIC and ƒÜuk topologies.  Principle of operation of the inverting topology  Fig. 1: Schematic of a buck‚Äìboost converter. thumb200pxFig. 2: The two operating states of a buck‚Äìboost converter: When the switch is turned on, the input voltage source supplies current to the inductor, and the capacitor supplies current to the resistor (output load). When the switch is opened, the inductor supplies current to the load via the diode D. The basic principle of the inverting buck‚Äìboost converter is fairly simple (see figure 2): *while in the On-state, the input voltage source is directly connected to the inductor (L). This results in accumulating energy in L. In this stage, the capacitor supplies energy to the output load. *while in the Off-state, the inductor is connected to the output load and capacitor, so energy is transferred from L to C and R. Compared to the buck and boost converters, the characteristics of the inverting buck‚Äìboost converter are mainly: * polarity of the output voltage is opposite to that of the input; * the output voltage can vary continuously from 0 to \\\\scriptstyle -\\\\infty (for an ideal converter). The output voltage ranges for a buck and a boost converter are respectively \\\\scriptstyle V_i to 0 and \\\\scriptstyle V_i to \\\\scriptstyle \\\\infty. Conceptual overview Like the buck and boost converters, the operation of the buck-boost is best understood in terms of the inductor's \\"reluctance\\" to allow rapid change in current. From the initial state in which nothing is charged and the switch is open, the current through the inductor is zero. When the switch is first closed, the blocking diode prevents current from flowing into the right hand side of the circuit, so it must all flow through the inductor. However, since the inductor doesn't allow rapid current change, it will initially keep the current low by dropping most of the voltage provided by the source. Over time, the inductor will allow the current to slowly increase by decreasing its own resistance. In an ideal circuit the voltage drop across the inductor would remain constant. When the inherent resistance of wires and the switch is taken into account then the voltage drop across the inductor will also decrease as the current increases. Also during this time, the inductor will store energy in the form of a magnetic field. Continuous mode Fig 3: Waveforms of current and voltage in a buck‚Äìboost converter operating in continuous mode. If the current through the inductor L never falls to zero during a commutation cycle, the converter is said to operate in continuous mode. The current and voltage waveforms in an ideal converter can be seen in Figure 3. From t=0 to t=DT, the converter is in On-State, so the switch S is closed. The rate of change in the inductor current (IL) is therefore given by :\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}I_L}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}=\\\\frac{V_i}{L} At the end of the On-state, the increase of IL is therefore: :\\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{On}}}=\\\\int_0^{D\\\\,T}\\\\operatorname{d}I_{\\\\text{L}}=\\\\int_0^{D\\\\, T}\\\\frac{V_i}{L} \\\\, \\\\operatorname{d}t=\\\\frac{V_i\\\\,D\\\\,T}{L} D is the duty cycle. It represents the fraction of the commutation period T during which the switch is On. Therefore D ranges between 0 (S is never on) and 1 (S is always on). During the Off-state, the switch S is open, so the inductor current flows through the load. If we assume zero voltage drop in the diode, and a capacitor large enough for its voltage to remain constant, the evolution of IL is: :\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}I_{\\\\text{L}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}=\\\\frac{V_o}{L} Therefore, the variation of IL during the Off-period is: :\\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{Off}}}=\\\\int_0^{\\\\left(1-D\\\\right) T}\\\\operatorname{d}I_{\\\\text{L}}=\\\\int_0^{\\\\left(1-D\\\\right) T}\\\\frac{V_o\\\\, \\\\operatorname{d}t}{L}=\\\\frac{V_o \\\\left(1-D\\\\right) T}{L} As we consider that the converter operates in steady-state conditions, the amount of energy stored in each of its components has to be the same at the beginning and at the end of a commutation cycle. As the energy in an inductor is given by: :E=\\\\frac{1}{2}L\\\\, I_{\\\\text{L}}^2 it is obvious that the value of IL at the end of the Off state must be the same with the value of IL at the beginning of the On-state, i.e. the sum of the variations of IL during the on and the off states must be zero: :\\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{On}}} + \\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{Off}}}=0 Substituting \\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{On}}} and \\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{Off}}} by their expressions yields: :\\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{On}}} + \\\\Delta I_{\\\\text{L}_{\\\\text{Off}}}=\\\\frac{V_i \\\\, D\\\\, T}{L}+\\\\frac{V_o\\\\left(1-D\\\\right)T}{L}=0 This can be written as: :\\\\frac{V_o}{V_i}=\\\\frac{-D}{1-D} This in return yields that: :D=\\\\frac{V_o}{V_o- V_i} From the above expression it can be seen that the polarity of the output voltage is always negative (because the duty cycle goes from 0 to 1), and that its absolute value increases with D, theoretically up to minus infinity when D approaches 1. Apart from the polarity, this converter is either step-up (a boost converter) or step-down (a buck converter). Thus it is named a buck‚Äìboost converter. Discontinuous mode Fig 4: Waveforms of current and voltage in a buck‚Äìboost converter operating in discontinuous mode. In some cases, the amount of energy required by the load is small enough to be transferred in a time smaller than the whole commutation period. In this case, the current through the inductor falls to zero during part of the period. The only difference in the principle described above is that the inductor is completely discharged at the end of the commutation cycle (see waveforms in figure 4). Although slight, the difference has a strong effect on the output voltage equation. It can be calculated as follows: Because the inductor current at the beginning of the cycle is zero, its maximum value I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}} (at t=D\\\\,T) is :I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}}=\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D\\\\, T}{L} During the off-period, IL falls to zero after Œ¥.T: :I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}}+\\\\frac{V_o\\\\, \\\\delta\\\\, T}{L}=0 Using the two previous equations, Œ¥ is: :\\\\delta=-\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D}{V_o} The load current I_o is equal to the average diode current (I_D). As can be seen on figure 4, the diode current is equal to the inductor current during the off-state. Therefore, the output current can be written as: :I_o=\\\\bar{I_D}=\\\\frac{I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}}}{2}\\\\delta Replacing I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}} and Œ¥ by their respective expressions yields: :I_o=-\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D\\\\, T}{2L}\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D}{V_o}=-\\\\frac{V_i^2\\\\, D^2\\\\, T}{2L\\\\, V_o} Therefore, the output voltage gain can be written as: :\\\\frac{V_o}{V_i}=-\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D^2 \\\\, T}{2L\\\\, I_o} Compared to the expression of the output voltage gain for the continuous mode, this expression is much more complicated. Furthermore, in discontinuous operation, the output voltage not only depends on the duty cycle, but also on the inductor value, the input voltage and the output current. Limit between continuous and discontinuous modes Fig 5: Evolution of the normalized output voltage with the normalized output current in a buck‚Äìboost converter. As told at the beginning of this section, the converter operates in discontinuous mode when low current is drawn by the load, and in continuous mode at higher load current levels. The limit between discontinuous and continuous modes is reached when the inductor current falls to zero exactly at the end of the commutation cycle. with the notations of figure 4, this corresponds to : :D\\\\, T + \\\\delta \\\\, T=T :D + \\\\delta = 1\\\\, In this case, the output current \\\\scriptstyle I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}} (output current at the limit between continuous and discontinuous modes) is given by: :I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}}=\\\\bar{I_D}=\\\\frac{I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}}}{2}\\\\left(1-D\\\\right) Replacing \\\\scriptstyle I_{L_{\\\\text{max}}} by the expression given in the discontinuous mode section yields: :I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}}=\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D\\\\, T}{2L}\\\\left(1-D\\\\right) As \\\\scriptstyle I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}} is the current at the limit between continuous and discontinuous modes of operations, it satisfies the expressions of both modes. Therefore, using the expression of the output voltage in continuous mode, the previous expression can be written as: :I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}}=\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, D\\\\, T}{2L}\\\\frac{V_i}{V_o}\\\\left(-D\\\\right) Let's now introduce two more notations: * the normalized voltage, defined by \\\\scriptstyle \\\\leftV_o\\\\right=\\\\frac{V_o}{V_i}. It corresponds to the gain in voltage of the converter; * the normalized current, defined by \\\\scriptstyle \\\\leftI_o\\\\right=\\\\frac{L}{T\\\\, V_i}I_o. The term \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{T\\\\, V_i}{L} is equal to the maximum increase of the inductor current during a cycle; i.e., the increase of the inductor current with a duty cycle D=1. So, in steady state operation of the converter, this means that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\leftI_o\\\\right equals 0 for no output current, and 1 for the maximum current the converter can deliver. Using these notations, we have: * in continuous mode, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\leftV_o\\\\right=-\\\\frac{D}{1-D}; * in discontinuous mode, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\leftV_o\\\\right=-\\\\frac{D^2}{2\\\\leftI_o\\\\right}; * the current at the limit between continuous and discontinuous mode is \\\\scriptstyle I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}}=\\\\frac{V_i\\\\, T}{2L}D\\\\left(1-D\\\\right)=\\\\frac{I_{o_{\\\\text{lim}}}}{2\\\\leftI_o\\\\right}D\\\\left(1-D\\\\right). Therefore the locus of the limit between continuous and discontinuous modes is given by \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\leftI_o\\\\right}D\\\\left(1-D\\\\right)=1. These expressions have been plotted in figure 5. The difference in behavior between the continuous and discontinuous modes can be seen clearly.  Principles of operation of the 4-switch topology  The basics of the 4-switch topology The 4-switch converter combines the buck and boost converters. It can operate in either the buck or the boost mode. In either mode, only one switch controls the duty cycle, another is for commutation and must be operated inversely to the former one, and the remaining two switches are in a fixed position. A 2-switch buck-boost converter can be built with two diodes, but upgrading the diodes to FET transistor switches doesn't cost much extra while due to lower voltage drop the efficiency improves. Non-ideal circuit=Effect of parasitic resistances In the analysis above, no dissipative elements (resistors) have been considered. That means that the power is transmitted without losses from the input voltage source to the load. However, parasitic resistances exist in all circuits, due to the resistivity of the materials they are made from. Therefore, a fraction of the power managed by the converter is dissipated by these parasitic resistances. For the sake of simplicity, we consider here that the inductor is the only non-ideal component, and that it is equivalent to an inductor and a resistor in series. This assumption is acceptable because an inductor is made of one long wound piece of wire, so it is likely to exhibit a non-negligible parasitic resistance (RL). Furthermore, current flows through the inductor both in the on and the off states. Using the state-space averaging method, we can write: :V_i=\\\\bar V_{\\\\text{L}} + \\\\bar V_S where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\bar V_{\\\\text{L}} and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\bar V_S are respectively the average voltage across the inductor and the switch over the commutation cycle. If we consider that the converter operates in steady-state, the average current through the inductor is constant. The average voltage across the inductor is: :\\\\bar V_{\\\\text{L}}=L\\\\frac{\\\\bar{dI_{\\\\text{L}}}}{dt}+R_{\\\\text{L}}\\\\bar I_{\\\\text{L}}=R_{\\\\text{L}}\\\\bar I_{\\\\text{L}} When the switch is in the on-state, \\\\scriptstyle V_S=0. When it is off, the diode is forward biased (we consider the continuous mode operation), therefore \\\\scriptstyle V_S = V_i - V_o. Therefore, the average voltage across the switch is: :\\\\bar V_S=D\\\\, 0 + (1-D)(V_i-V_o)=(1-D)(V_i-V_o) The output current is the opposite of the inductor current during the off-state. the average inductor current is therefore: :\\\\bar I_{\\\\text{L}}=\\\\frac{-I_o}{1-D} Fig 6: Evolution of the output voltage of a buck‚Äìboost converter with the duty cycle when the parasitic resistance of the inductor increases. Assuming the output current and voltage have negligible ripple, the load of the converter can be considered purely resistive. If R is the resistance of the load, the above expression becomes: :\\\\bar I_{\\\\text{L}}=\\\\frac{-V_o}{(1-D)R} Using the previous equations, the input voltage becomes: :V_i= R_{\\\\text{L}}\\\\frac{-V_o}{(1-D)R}+ (1-D)(V_i-V_o) This can be written as: :\\\\frac{V_o}{V_i}=\\\\frac{-D}{\\\\frac{R_{\\\\text{L}}}{R(1-D)}+1-D} If the inductor resistance is zero, the equation above becomes equal to the one of the ideal case. But when RL increases, the voltage gain of the converter decreases compared to the ideal case. Furthermore, the influence of RL increases with the duty cycle. This is summarized in figure 6.

This enzyme is part of the pathway that recycles a substance called tetrahydrobiopterin, also known as BH4. Tetrahydrobiopterin works with an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase to process a substance called phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an amino acid (a building block of proteins) that is obtained through the diet; it is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. When tetrahydrobiopterin interacts with phenylalanine hydroxylase, tetrahydrobiopterin is altered and must be recycled to a usable form. The regeneration of this substance is critical for the proper processing of several other amino acids in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin also helps produce certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells. The QDPR gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 at position 15.31, from base pair 17,164,291 to base pair 17,189,981. In melanocytic cells QDPR gene expression may be regulated by MITF. Related conditions Mutations in the QDPR gene are a common cause of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. More than 30 disorder-causing mutations in this gene have been identified, including aberrant splicing, amino acid substitutions, insertions, or premature terminations. These mutations completely, or almost completely, inactivate quinoid dihydropteridine reductase, which prevents the normal recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin. In the absence of usable tetrahydrobiopterin, the body cannot process phenylalanine correctly. As a result, phenylalanine from the diet builds up in the bloodstream and other tissues and can lead to brain damage. Neurotransmitters in the brain are also affected, resulting in delayed development, seizures, movement disorders, and other symptoms. In addition, a reduction in the activity of quinoid dihydropteridine reductase may cause calcium to build up abnormally in certain parts of the brain, resulting in damage to nerve cells.

In 1986 Kadey left South Africa and became partner with the Waterland Design Group in Hollywood, designing studios at Capitol Records, Virgin Tokyo, Sony/Epic Santa Monica, and many other recording venues. At this time Warrick Sony bought in as partner with the purchase of recording equipment. Aimed at providing a platform for independent music with a social message, Shifty was an outlet for South African musicians opposed to apartheid. As a result, Shifty struggled to gain exposure on the radio stations of the Broederbond- controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation. Its anti-establishment stance was appealing to young and politically marginalized South Africans. This was evident when poet Mzwakhe Mbuli's unadvertised Change is Pain went gold after the apartheid regime banned possession and distribution of the album. The label helped establish boerepunk and the alternative Afrikaans genre at a time when it was a reflex to stereotype all Afrikaners as supporters of the National Party. Operating from a caravan hitched to a Ford V6 truck, the Shifty studio produced an album every two months until 1993. Kontaktn√§tet, a Swedish non-governmental cultural organisation financially supported Shifty Records from 1986 to 1992 and held various manifestations in Sweden for the company and the various artists associated with Shifty. Apartheid security campaign against Shifty In 2002, notorious Bureau of State Security agent, Paul Erasmus was granted amnesty by the Truth & Reconciliation Commission for his overzealous campaign against Shifty Records artist, Roger Lucey, a campaign which ended his career. The amnesty application does not apply to other artists, appearing with Lucey, or released on the Shifty label. In particular, Lucey appears on Shifty compilation albums such as Forces Favourites and Anaartjie in our Sosatie. Erasmus claims in his biography to have waged a total war against the music industry. He is also one of Lucey's biggest fans, having confiscated most of his albums from record stores. The entire episode is documented in Stopping the Music: The Roger Lucey Story.

He has been the leader of the Republican Proposal (PRO) party since its founding in 2005. He previously served as 5th Chief of Government of Buenos Aires from 2007 to 2015, and was a member of the Chamber of Deputies representing Buenos Aires from 2005 to 2007. Ideologically, he identifies as a moderate and centrist conservative on the Argentine centre-right. Born Tandil, Argentina, Macri trained as a civil engineer at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and attended Columbia University for business school. After embarking on a business career, he was kidnapped in 1991 which, after being released, prompted him to enter politics. He served as president of football club Boca Juniors from 1994 to 2007, reestablishing its profitability which raised his public profile. In 2003 he launched the Commitment for Change (CPC) party, eventually developing it into the modern PRO party. Following an unsuccessful bid for mayor of Buenos Aires that year Macri won election in 2007 as the city's chief of government and won re-election in 2011. Four years later he was elected president of Argentina in the narrow 2015 general election ‚Äì the first presidential runoff ballotage in Argentinian history. The presidency of Macri focused on reforming the national economy and improving diplomatic relations. He aligned the country with gradualist neoliberalism and re-opened Argentina to international markets by lifting currency controls, restructuring sovereign debt, and pressing free-market solutions. Domestically he pursued moderate socially liberal policies, liberalized the energy sector, and combatted public corruption. His legislative pursuits varied in efficacy and received mixed reception from Argentines and globally. Macri navigated the 2018 monetary crisis by securing outside funding from the International Monetary Fund reversing initial fiscal restraint. Macri became the first incumbent president to lose reelection to a second term during the 2019 general elections. His presidency has been criticized for failing to materially reform the economy while receiving praise for leaving a legacy of anti-corruption and increasing Argentina's sovereign marketability.  Overview  Born in Tandil, Buenos Aires Province, Macri is the son of Franco Macri, a prominent Italian businessman in the industrial and construction sectors, and was raised in an upper class home. He received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and studied at Columbia University's business school in New York City, United States. Macri became president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's two most popular football clubs, in 1995. In 2005, he created the centre-right Republican Proposal party (Propuesta Republicana, also known as PRO). Although Macri was a potential presidential candidate in the 2011 general elections, he ran instead for re-election as mayor. He received about 47 percent of the vote in the mayoral election, which led to a runoff election on 31 July 2011 against Daniel Filmus in which Macri was re-elected for a second consecutive term. On 22 November 2015, after a tie in the first round of the presidential elections on 25 October, he received 51.34 percent of the vote to defeat Front for Victory candidate Daniel Scioli and was inaugurated on 10 December 2015 in the Argentine Congress. Macri ended the sovereign default and removed currency controls, but inflation remained high and the 2018 Argentine monetary crisis led to a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its largest ever awarded.\\"Argentina gets biggest loan in IMF's history at $57bn\\", The Guardian, 26 September 2018. By April 2019, inflation had reached 55%. Prices for public utilities, fixed since 2002 despite the high inflation, were gradually restored to market figures. In the international arena, the country left the pink tide and was a vocal critic of Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. The party won the most districts during the 2017 midterm elections, and Macri announced that he would run for a second term in 2019. He secured his party's nomination in the 2019 Presidential election in August 2019 despite a poor performance in the primary. In 2016, Macri was named one of the world's 100 most influential people and the most powerful president in Latin America by US news magazine Time. Boca Juniors Mauricio Macri and Mart√≠n Palermo, football player of Boca Juniors. Macri intended to run for chairman of sports club Boca Juniors in 1991, but his father convinced him to keep working at Sevel. He tried to buy the Deportivo Espa√±ol team, but could not get support from the team's board of directors. Macri supported Boca Juniors, paying coach C√©sar Luis Menotti's salary and buying players for the team (including forward Walter Perazzo). Franco, skeptical about his son's prospects for success, later allowed him to run Boca Juniors. He instructed aide Orlando Salvestrini to work with Mauricio for two reasons: to help him and to monitor his activities. Mauricio met with former Boca Juniors chairmen Antonio Alegre and Carlos Heller, and tried to convince them to work with him; both rebuffed him. Macri later sought the support of other groups in Boca Juniors, eventually winning the team's internal elections in 1995 with 7,058 votes.Todo Macri, pp. 29-33 His first years were unsuccessful; the team's performance was poor, players frequently complained about salaries and bonuses, and Macri changed coaches three times. The only initial improvement was a partial reconstruction of the stadium. He arranged for the Boca Juniors institution to operate on the stock exchange, selling shares of active football players owned by the club. Macri's first coach was Carlos Salvador Bilardo, who brought 14 new players to the team and finished the 1996 Apertura league in 10th place. His second coach, H√©ctor Veira, also performed poorly. New coach Carlos Bianchi helped Juan Rom√°n Riquelme improve his performance, and had Mart√≠n Palermo and Guillermo Barros Schelotto as effective forwards. They won the first two tournaments, beginning a record 40-match unbeaten run. Early political career Macri in 2007 Macri entered politics in 2003, founding the centre-right party Commitment to Change (). The party was intended to be a source of new politicians, since the major parties were discredited after the December 2001 riots. Later that year, Macri ran for mayor of Buenos Aires, alongside Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta. Although he won the first round of the election with 37 percent of the vote, he lost the runoff election with 46 percent of the vote going to sitting mayor An√≠bal Ibarra, who was re-elected. In 2005, Macri joined Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy of Recrear in a political coalition, the Republican Proposal (PRO), and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies with 33.9 percent of the vote. His campaigns were managed by Jaime Dur√°n Barba. According to a 2007 report, Macri had participated in only 44 of 321 votings; he countered that he had become disappointed with Congress, since bills sent by the president were not open to debate or amendment. Ibarra was impeached and removed from office in 2006 as a result of the Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n nightclub fire, and his term was completed by vice-chief of government Jorge Telerman. Macri (center) with President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner (left) and Buenos Aires Governor Daniel Scioli (right) in 2008 During 2006, Macri worked both on his political activities as deputy and with his presidency of Boca Juniors. Before the 2007 general elections, he negotiated with the likely presidential candidate Jorge Sobisch, the governor of Neuqu√©n Province, to create a national right-wing political coalition. This conflicted with Macri's alliance with Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy, who also intended to run for president and had denounced Sobisch for corruption. Later that year, Sobisch's image was severely tarnished when teacher Carlos Fuentealba was killed during a union demonstration in Neuqu√©n. He immediately backed out of his pact with Sobisch and remained neutral during the national election, which was won by Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner of the Front for Victory (FPV). In February 2007, Macri announced that he would run again for mayor of Buenos Aires, heading the PRO slate with Gabriela Michetti. In the 2 June 2007 first round, he received 45.6 percent of the vote and defeated government-backed Daniel Filmus (who received 23.8 percent of the vote); incumbent Jorge Telerman finished third. In the 24 June runoff election, Macri defeated Filmus with 60.96 percent of the vote.BBC News, 25 June 2007. Profile: Mauricio Macri . For the 2009 midterm elections, he allied with Francisco de Narv√°ez and Felipe Sol√°. The alliance was successful; De Narvaez defeated former president N√©stor Kirchner in Buenos Aires Province and Gabriela Michetti won the city election. With this defeat, the Kirchners lost their majority in both chambers of the Congress. Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, whose public image was good after the death and state funeral of N√©stor Kirchner in late 2010, ran for re-election. Macri, who was considered a likely candidate for the opposition, ran for re-election as mayor instead. He won the first round on 10 July 2011 with 47.08 percent of the vote against Filmus's 27.78 percent, and then the 31 July runoff against Filmus with 64.25 percent of the vote. Buenos Aires administration=Public transport 200 Series train on Line A of the Buenos Aires Underground Macri's administration worked on public transport in an attempt to reduce auto traffic in Buenos Aires. One project was the Metrobus, a bus rapid transit system added to the city's main streets. By the end of Macri's term as mayor, the system had five lines and 113 stations. Other streets have bikeways to promote cycling, and the city created its EcoBici bicycle-sharing scheme. By the end of Macri's administration, about of bicycle lanes were constructed and 49 of the planned 200 automated bicycle-sharing stations were built. Several level crossings on the city's commuter-rail network were replaced by tunnels to improve road and rail traffic flow. Under Macri, the city committed to two large rail-infrastructure projects: running viaducts through the center of the city to extend the Belgrano Sur Line, and raising the San Mart√≠n Line to eliminate level crossings. Macri proposed the Red de Expresos Regionales project to link the city's main railway terminals and lines with a series of tunnels; as of 2018, in the term of his successor Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta, the project is still in the planning stages. Macri with then-President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner during the inauguration of Autopista Illia in 2014 The Buenos Aires Underground, initially maintained by the national government, was the subject of a year-long dispute between him and the Fern√°ndez de Kirchner government. The national government sought to transfer it to the city, which Macri supported, but the budget and length of the transition period were contested. Macri announced that the city would take over the underground on 13 November 2012. Line A, which was using wooden cars almost a century old, received a fleet of modern cars from the national government; Line H also received new cars. Madrid Metro rolling-stock purchases for Line B were criticised, despite their technical superiority, for having a limited compatibility with the line and costing more than new trains for the city's commuter-rail network. Metropolitan police Metropolitan Police graduates Buenos Aires, initially a federal district with limited autonomy, had become an autonomous city with the 1994 amendment of the Constitution of Argentina. The Argentine Federal Police, under national- government jurisdiction, still worked in the city and disputes over a potential transfer to a local force were unresolved when Macri was elected. He unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a transfer with President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. As an alternative, in 2008 Macri proposed a bill for the creation of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police to work with federal police in the city. The bill, supported by the PRO and the Kirchnerite blocs, was rejected by Civic Coalition blocs and those aligned with Ibarra. Elisa Carri√≥, leader of the Civic Coalition, thought that Macri had abandoned the transfer request, and Ibarra said that the forces' duties would overlap. The Metropolitan Police began with nearly 1,000 officers; the Federal Police had 17,000 officers working in the city. As a result, the metropolitan police worked on a small scale during the transition and more complex tasks were reserved for the federal police. Jorge Alberto Palacios was the first chief of the Metropolitan Police. A member of the police unit which rescued Macri from his kidnappers, Palacios was fired by then-President N√©stor Kirchner for his alleged involvement in the murder of Axel Blumberg (for which he was acquitted). His appointment was controversial; Palacios had been investigated for concealing evidence of the 1994 AMIA bombing, and he resigned a short time later. The transfer of police protection to the city was completed during the Larreta administration. Same-sex marriage Macri and Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis) A gay couple, Jos√© Mar√≠a Di Bello and Alex Freyre, started a judicial case so that they could get married in Buenos Aires. They challenged articles 172 and 188 of the civil code, which restrict marriage to people of different genders, as unconstitutional. Judge Gabriela Seijas agreed, and the couple married in 2009. It was the first same-sex marriage in Argentina. Macri did not appeal the ruling, saying that same-sex marriage was becoming universally accepted and individuals had a right to happiness. He compared the controversy with the sanctioning of divorce during the 1980s after the restoration of democracy in Argentina; highly controversial at first, it was eventually accepted. A federal law permitting same-sex marriage was passed the following year. Macri's refusal to appeal the sentence affected his relationship with Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (who later became Pope Francis). Bergoglio opposed same-sex marriage, and expected Macri to appeal the ruling. According to the archbishop, a lower-court judge should not establish the constitutionality of a law and Macri should have appealed the ruling in a higher court. Bergoglio was also annoyed by what he considered a lack of communication between himself and Macri. Presidential elections Macri's 2015 presidential campaign logo Macri ran for president of Argentina in 2015. With President Cristina Kirchner unable to run, early opinion polls indicated a close three-way race between Macri, Kirchnerite governor Daniel Scioli and Tigre mayor Sergio Massa. Other minor parties, such as the Radical Civic Union (UCR), the Civic Coalition (CC) and some socialist parties, made a political coalition, the Broad Front UNEN. This coalition disbanded before the elections, and the UCR and CC made a coalition with the PRO, named Cambiemos (). Macri supported Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta against Gabriela Michetti in the PRO primary elections for mayor of Buenos Aires. Larreta won the primary and general elections, and Michetti was selected as Macri's vice-presidential candidate. Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal, Macri's deputy mayor, ran on the Cambiemos ticket for governor of Buenos Aires Province, a populous province which was strategic to the elections. Macri and Massa negotiated a coalition against Kirchnerism, which would have seen Massa withdraw from the presidential race to run for governor of Buenos Aires on the Cambiemos ticket. Macri declined this proposal, kept Vidal as the party's candidate for governor, and Massa ran for president with his own party. Macri, Carri√≥ and Ernesto Sanz ran in the primary elections, which Macri won. Pre-election polls indicated that Scioli would win by a wide margin, possibly avoiding a ballotage. The final results showed Scioli finishing first with 37.08 percent, just ahead of Macri's 34.15 percent, leading to a ballotage round on 22 November. Massa finished third with 21 percent of the vote, and the other two candidates contended for his voters. Scioli and Macri were polarized about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner; Scioli wanted to keep most Kirchnerite policies, and Macri wanted to change them. In the legislative elections, the Front for Victory (FPV) lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies but kept it in the Senate. Cordoba, in August 2015 Scioli did not participate in the first presidential debate, which was held with the other five candidates. When the ballotage was confirmed, Macri agreed to a debate with Scioli. Two debates were planned: one by the Argentina Debate NGO and another by TV news channel Todo Noticias. Macri preferred a single debate, and opted for the one organized by Argentina Debate. He criticized Scioli for negative campaigning by the FPV. Several politicians and FPV institutions had issued warnings about what might happen if Macri were elected president. According to Scioli, the campaign was intended to encourage public awareness. It was rumored that the campaign might have been suggested by Brazilian political consultant Jo√£o Santana, who had organized a similar campaign in Brazil during the ballotage of Dilma Rousseff and A√©cio Neves in the 2014 Brazilian general election. The ballotage was held on 22 November. Scioli conceded with 70 percent of the votes counted and provisional results of 53 and 47 percent. The gap between the candidates slowly narrowed over the next few hours, giving Macri a smaller margin of victory than most exit polls suggested. His election ended a dozen years of Kirchnerism in Argentina. Macri owed his victory to C√≥rdoba, the second- largest province, swinging dramatically to support him; he carried the province by over 930,000 votes in the second round, far exceeding his nationwide margin of 680,600 votes. Buenos Aires also swung hard to Macri, giving its mayor over 64 percent of the vote in the second round. On August 11, 2019, Macri scored the primary election which gave him renomination as his party's candidate in the 2019 Argentine Presidential election.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/world/americas/argentina-election- macri-kirchner.html He was renominated, but scored only 32%, compared to 47% to populist Alberto Fern√°ndez and his running mate, Cristina Kirchner, in their primary for Frente de Todos.https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750707125/markets-in-argentina-plunge- after-poor-primary-showing-for-incumbent-president Presidency=Inauguration Macri announced his cabinet on 25 November 2015, about two weeks before he was due to take office. The presidential transition was difficult. Macri and Kirchner met briefly; she provided no help to the new administration, and spoke only about the inauguration ceremony. They disagreed about its location; Kirchner wanted it to take place at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress, and Macri favoured the White Hall of the Casa Rosada. Plans for violence against Macri supporters near the Plaza during the inauguration were rumoured, and it was unclear who would control the police during the ceremony. Judge Mar√≠a Servini de Cubr√≠a ruled that Kirchner's term of office ended at midnight on the morning of 10 December, and provisional Senate president Federico Pinedo was in charge of the executive branch for the 12 hours between the end of Kirchner's term and Macri's swearing-in. Kirchner left Buenos Aires that day to attend the inauguration of sister-in-law Alicia Kirchner as governor of Santa Cruz Province. Macri took office on 10 December. He took the oath of office at the National Congress of Argentina after Vice President Gabriela Michetti. Macri delivered a 27-minute speech pledging \\"support for an independent judiciary, to fight corruption and drug trafficking, the internal union of Argentina, universal social protection, a 21st-century style of education and for everyone to have a roof, water and sewer\\" and greeted his electoral rivals. Macri receives the presidential sash from acting president Federico Pinedo. He later went to the Casa Rosada and received the presidential sash in the White Hall from Senate President Federico Pinedo, accompanied by Michetti, Chamber of Deputies President Emilio Monz√≥ and Supreme Court President Ricardo Lorenzetti. Minutes later, Macri went to the balcony and told the crowd in the Plaza de Mayo that \\"Argentines deserve to live better, and we are about to start a wonderful period for our country. I promise to always tell the truth and show where our problems are\\". He called on \\"all Argentines to follow [his] administration and alert them when [the government] makes mistakes\\". After his swearing-in, Macri hosted a reception at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' San Mart√≠n Palace for heads of state Michelle Bachelet (Chile), Horacio Cartes (Paraguay), Juan Manuel Santos (Colombia), Rafael Correa (Ecuador), Evo Morales (Bolivia), Dilma Rousseff (Brazil) and King Juan Carlos I of Spain, and representatives of other countries who attended his inauguration.  Economic policy  Macri with former president Bill Clinton, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, economist Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and London mayor Sadiq Khan at the Clinton Global Initiative Macri began his presidency with economic difficulties carried over from previous governments. The Central Bank of Argentina's reserves were depleted; inflation was over 30 percent, although the widely discredited National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC) provided a lower figure. The country had the highest tax rates in its history, but the government budget balance had an eight-percent deficit. There had been a sovereign default since 2001, and a conflict existed with hedge funds; tight currency controls had been in place since 2011. Since Argentina is a developing country, a global drop in commodity prices reduced trade revenue. One of Macri's first economic policies was the removal of currency controls, allowing Argentines to freely buy and sell foreign currencies. Argentina has had a floating exchange rate since then, with intervention from the Central Bank, and the Argentine peso was devalued by 30 percent. Another early policy was the removal of export quotas and tariffs on corn and wheat. Tariffs on soybeans, the most lucrative Argentine export, were reduced from 35 to 30 percent. Argentine delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2016. It was the return of the country to the conference after 11 years of absence. Macri wanted to negotiate with holdouts and end the default to return to the international capital markets and strengthen the national economy. Argentina offered to pay $6.5 billion to settle lawsuits on 5 February 2016, requesting that the prior ruling on its payments be lifted. Although Cambiemos did not have a majority in either house of Congress, the bill was approved in March and Argentina faced a court hearing in New York on 13 April. The court upheld judge Thomas P. Griesa's ruling, allowing Argentina to pay the 2005 and 2010 bondholders to whom it was still in default. The payment, made with a bond sale, was reportedly the end of the Argentine default, which had begun in 2001. On 19 January 2016, Macri attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with opposition figure Sergio Massa and part of his cabinet, in a search for investors. He was one of the best-known figures at the meeting, along with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and US vice president Joe Biden. It was the first time since 2003 that Argentina had participated in the forum. During Macri's first year, economic recovery was slow. Unemployment and inflation remained high and growth did not come as expected. Kirchner's Careful Pricing price-control program, which benefited small and medium-sized enterprises, was kept with a revision of its included products. The government began several public-works projects to stimulate the economy and help the construction sector. Political intervention in the INDEC figures ended, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared in November 2016 that Argentine statistics were again in accordance with international standards. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that Argentina would emerge from recession in 2017 or 2018, and lowered its country risk classification from seven points to six. The economy worsened in 2018: inflation remained high, due in part to a trade deficit. The production of soy, the country's main export, had been reduced by a drought which was among the worst natural disasters in the world that year. The US Federal Reserve increased its interest rates, which raised the price of the US dollar against other currencies. The Central Bank of Argentina increased the interest rate to 60 percent, but could not hold off inflation. Macri announced on 8 May that Argentina would seek a loan from the IMF. The initial loan was US$50bn. Federico Sturzenegger, president of the Central Bank, resigned a week later. Macri replaced him with Luis Caputo, and merged the ministries of treasury and finances into a single ministry led by Nicol√°s Dujovne. The US‚ÄìTurkey diplomatic conflict caused a new increase on the US dollar. As a result of the crisis, the tariffs on soy exports were restored. Caputo resigned, and Guido Sandleris replaced him as president of the Central Bank. The IMF expanded the loan with an extra 7 billion, on the condition that the Central Bank would only adjust the price of the peso against the US dollar under certain conditions. The 2019 budget reduced some expenditures and increased some taxes, in order to completely avoid a deficit. Energy policy Macri announcing an investment deal for the Vaca Muerta shale deposit in Patagonia Prices for public utilities, such as electricity, gas and water, were fixed in 2002 by president Eduardo Duhalde during the 1998‚Äì2002 Argentine great depression. The Kirchners kept them fixed, and the state subsidized them to compensate for inflation, which rose by nearly 700 percent during their government. Investment in the utility sectors decreased, and generation and distribution networks deteriorated. Argentina lost its self-sufficiency, and went from an energy exporter to an importer. The cost of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. The Kirchners left the grid on the brink of collapse, while their lavish subsidies were a large factor in the fiscal deficit that harmed the overall economy. In 2016, Minister Juan Jos√© Aranguren arranged the removal of state subsidies for electricity, gas and water, which caused a huge increase in prices for those utilities. The increases were met with protests in several cities. Because mandatory public hearings had not been held on the price increases, these were annulled by the courts. The Supreme Court upheld a temporary halt of the price increase for residential customers in September 2016. Seeking to increase energy production, Macri signed an investment deal for the Vaca Muerta shale deposit in Patagonia. Roughly the size of Belgium, Vaca Muerta has the second-largest reserve of shale gas in the world. To finalise the deal, the unions negotiated flexibility in labour costs, which had been the main drawback to industrial development in the area. The Neuqu√©n Province government pledged to improve roads and general infrastructure. Human rights Human rights organizations had aligned themselves with the governments of both N√©stor and Cristina Kirchner, even in topics unrelated to human rights, and often worked as their spokesmen. They continued this role after 2015, when Macri defeated the Kirchnerite candidate in the presidential elections,Novaro, pp. 16-19 which undermined the legitimacy of the organizations in Argentine society.Novaro, p. 21 Macri maintained a distant relation with those organizations, and did not seek their support, but did not openly confront them. They kept their funding and the institutions under their control, and the trials of military personnel for crimes in the Dirty War (1974‚Äì1983) continued. Nevertheless, the organizations continued their opposition to Macri.Novaro, p. 26 His cabinet was divided on an approach to take: whether to directly confront the organizations and remove their state financing, or to take an active role in their activities and replace their leaders with less politically motivated figures.Novaro, pp. 30-31 The general policy, however, was to ignore the disputes and focus the activities of the government towards more pressing matters, such as the economy.Novaro, p. 29 The government modified the public holiday for the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice, which makes reference to the 1976 Argentine coup d'√©tat, to allow it to be celebrated on a movable date. This ruling was met with huge criticism. The ruling was reverted some days later, and the holiday was kept at the fixed date of 24 March. Social issues The #NiUnaMenos movement, which advanced a feminist agenda in Argentina since 2015, stayed strong during the Macri presidency. Macri said during the 2018 opening of the National Congress that, although he was anti-abortion, he wanted the Congress to have an abortion debate and discuss a bill for a new abortion law. As of 2018, abortion was only legally allowed for rapes and cases that may threaten the mother's health. The feminist movement organized several demonstrations in the following months, in support of the voluntary termination of pregnancy abortion bill that was proposed in Congress. The proposal, however, became highly polarizing. The country has a strong conservative catholic population, particularly in the less-populated provinces, who rejected the bill. This polarization was unrelated to the political polarization of the country, and the legislators of both Cambiemos and the Justicialist Party (PJ) were divided on the vote. The bill was approved by the chamber of deputies in June, but opposition became more organized after its approval and the Senate rejected the bill, by 38 to 31 votes. Foreign relations Mauricio Macri, US president Donald Trump and their respective first ladies, at the White House in the United States During Macri's presidency, Argentina's foreign relations shifted substantially from those under Kirchner. He immediately proposed action against Nicol√°s Maduro in Venezuela for human-rights abuses and to remove that country from Mercosur. This shift was part of a change in the Latin American pink tide. The other countries in the bloc also opposed Maduro's socialist government, and prevented Venezuela from taking the pro tempore presidency of Mercosur. The bloc sought a trade and cooperation agreement with the European Union and closer ties with the Pacific Alliance. Macri agreed with Brazilian president Michel Temer to guarantee free trade between their countries. Macri and Temer increased their interest in better trade relations with Mexico, the second-largest economy in Latin America, when became involved a diplomatic conflict with US president Donald Trump. Argentina and Venezuela had troubled relations at the time. The 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election was considered illegal by Argentina, which does not acknowledge the legislative body established by it. Macri also removed the Order of the Liberator General San Mart√≠n award from Maduro. Argentina signed the Declaration of Lima, which established the Lima Group, a supranational body of countries that consider Venezuela to be under a dictatorship and want to restore its democracy. Maduro was re-elected in the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election and took office for a new term on 10 January 2019. This started the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, as many countries believed that Maduro had committed electoral fraud. Argentina and Brazil, under the newly elected Jair Bolsonaro, refused to acknowledge Maduro as a legitimate ruler. They instead acknowledged Juan Guaid√≥, who was appointed president of Venezuela by the National Assembly. Macri and German chancellor Angela Merkel during the 2017 G20 Summit in Hamburg Macri also shifted Argentina's relations with the United States. During a visit in 2016, president Barack Obama praised him: \\"I'm impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised, to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth, to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community\\". Obama announced that the US would declassify its military and intelligence records of the 1970s Dirty War. Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, which was won by Republican Donald Trump. Macri forged diplomatic relations with Trump and brought in measures likened to Trump's border policies, including tightening control of immigration, limiting the entry of convicted criminals and facilitating the deportation of foreigners who commit crimes. In 2019, Trump declassified more than 5,600 US documents about the Dirty War. Macri maintained the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. However, he took a less-confrontational stance towards the United Kingdom and allowed more flights between Argentina and the islands. Although relations between Argentina and the UK have improved, the United Kingdom maintains its claim to the islands and refuses to discuss the sovereignty of the islands, claiming that Argentina is ignoring the wishes of the islanders to remain British. Macri acknowledged Juan Guaid√≥ as president of Venezuela during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. Macri changed Argentina's position on conflicts in the Middle East. During Macri's first week in office, he voided the memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran, which would have established a joint investigation of the 1994 AMIA bombing, a terrorist attack on a Jewish organization for which Argentina had blamed Hezbollah and Iran. The memorandum had been ruled unconstitutional by the judiciary, a ruling which was appealed during Kirchner's presidency. Macri withdrew the appeal, upholding the original ruling. He distanced himself from Iran and encouraged continued investigations of the AMIA bombing and the death of Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor investigating the case. Those cases and Nisman's probe of Kirchner have special importance for Argentina‚ÄìIsrael relations, and ambassador Carlos Faustino Garc√≠a and Israeli diplomat Modi Efraim praised Macri for encouraging the investigations. In July 2016, it was announced that Argentina would grant asylum to 3,000 refugees of the Syrian Civil War. Midterm elections Mauricio Macri during the electoral campaign of 2017 The 2017 Argentine legislative election renewed a third of the seats in the Senate and half in the chamber of deputies. The election was considered a referendum on the presidency of Macri up to that point. Kirchner, leader of the opposition, ran for senator for the populous Buenos Aires province. She left the PJ to avoid the primary elections and created a new party, Citizen's Unity. Esteban Bullrich, minister of education, was the candidate of Cambiemos in the district. Kirchner and Bullrich had a close tie in the primary election, and Kirchner prevailed by just 0.21 percent of the vote. The electoral campaign, however, was largely ignored, as the media was focused on the ongoing controversy over the disappearance of Santiago Maldonado (see below). Kirchner used the case in her political campaign, stating that Maldonado was the victim of a forced disappearance, similar to those of the Dirty War. Maldonado was found dead a few days before the general elections, and the circumstances and autopsy refuted Kirchner's theory. Cambiemos won in thirteen of the twenty-three provinces of Argentina, and in the five most-populated districts. Kirchner ended in a distant second place, as a result of the higher turnout for the general elections. Personal life Macri was born in Tandil in the province of Buenos Aires, the son of Italian- born tycoon Francesco \\"Franco\\" Macri (owner of the Philco affiliate in Argentina) and Alicia Blanco-Villegas Cinque. The family moved to Buenos Aires a short time later, and kept their houses in Tandil as vacation properties. His father, and his uncle Jorge Blanco Villegas, influenced Macri to become a businessman, and Franco expected his son to succeed him as leader of his firms. Macri preferred his uncle's company to constant scrutiny by his father. He was educated at Colegio Cardenal Newman,\\"Los amigos de Macri: del Cardenal Newman y la empresa, al poder\\", La Nacion, 27 November 2015. (Retrieved 17 June 2016) and received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. At this time Macri became interested in neoliberalism and joined the now-defunct Union of the Democratic Centre and a think tank led by former minister √Ålvaro Alsogaray.Todo Macri, pp. 8-10 In 1985, he briefly attended Columbia Business School, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the Universidad del CEMA in Buenos Aires.Mauricio Macri's curriculum vitae , CEMA; accessed 23 November 2015. Macri's professional experience began at SIDECO Americana, a construction company which was part of his father's Socma Group (Sociedad Macri) holding company, where he worked for three years as a junior analyst and became a senior analyst. In 1984, he worked in the credit department of Citibank Argentina in Buenos Aires. Macri joined Socma Group the same year, and became its general manager in 1985. In 1992, he became vice president of Sevel Argentina (then manufacturing Fiat and Peugeot automobiles under licence in Argentina as part of Socma), and became president two years later. In 1991, Macri was kidnapped for 12 days by officers of the Argentine Federal Police. Kept in a small room with a chemical toilet and a hole in the roof to receive food, he was freed when his family reportedly paid a multimillion-dollar ransom. Macri has said that the ordeal led him to enter politics. His first wife was Ivonne Bordeu, daughter of race-car driver Juan Manuel Bordeu. They had three sons: Agustina, Jimena and Francisco. After they divorced, Macri married model Isabel Menditeguy in 1994; Franco requested a prenuptial agreement. Although the marriage reached a crisis when Macri became chairman of Boca Juniors, they did not divorce until 2005. He began a romance with Mar√≠a Laura Groba which did not lead to marriage. Macri left Groba in 2010, began a relationship with businesswoman Juliana Awada and married Awada that year. At the wedding reception, he wore a fake moustache as part of his impersonation of singer Freddie Mercury. Macri accidentally swallowed the moustache, and Minister of Health Jorge Lemus performed first aid to save his life. Controversies=Wiretapping case Sergio Burstein was the leader of a group of people whose relatives died in the AMIA bombing. Macri was charged in a 2010 wiretapping case, suspected of spying on Burstein and his brother-in-law N√©stor Daniel Leonardo. Macri denied the charges. Judge Norberto Oyarbide indicted him, and Federal Chamber members Eduardo Farah, Eduardo Freiler and Jorge Ballestero confirmed the indictment. It was suspected at the time that Macri had organized a clandestine spy network with the aid of Jorge Alberto Palacios and Ciro James. The case was transferred to judge Sebasti√°n Casanello, who ordered further investigation. It was learned that Macri had little knowledge about Palacios' daily activities and his minister, Mariano Narodowski, had appointed James. Franco Macri, the president's father, admitted to hiring private agencies to spy on Daniel Leonardo. Although Casanello dismissed the charges in 2015, Leonardo appealed the ruling; the dismissal was upheld several months later in federal court. Farah, Freiler and Ballestero voted for acquittal; others involved in the case, including Palacios, are still under investigation. Panama Papers In 2016, the Panama Papers were leaked, comprising 11.5 million documents detailing offshore entities owned by people from many countries. Macri was listed as a director of Fleg Trading from 1998 to 2009. He did not declare his involvement in 2007, when he became mayor, or in 2015, when he became president. Prosecutor Federico Delgado asked the judiciary to determine if Macri \\"maliciously failed to complete his tax declaration\\". Macri argued that he did not report his involvement because he was not a stakeholder and did not receive money from it. The company was established by his father to run a failed Brazilian business. Macri owns other foreign accounts with properly- disclosed transactions, and said that he would file a judicial \\"declaration of certainty\\" to affirm his statements. A similar company, Kagemusha, was discovered several months later. It was established in 1981 by Franco Macri, with his then-22-year-old son as its vice president. On 20 September 2017, civil judge Andr√©s Fraga determined that, in Fleg Trading Ltd, Mauricio Macri accepted the position of director for the sole and only effect of designating a replacement and resigning, and that in Kagemusha he did not even tacitly accept the position of director for which he was appointed by Franco Macri. The ruling added that he was not a shareholder in either of the two companies, that he did not receive any dividends or profits, did not participate in the business decisions, nor was he the owner or co-owner of any current bank account of the companies. Detention of Milagro Sala Gerardo Morales of the UCR was elected governor of Jujuy Province in the 2015 elections. Although the UCR was part of Cambiemos in federal politics, it was allied with Sergio Massa in the province. Morales was the first non-Peronist governor in the province since 1983. He opposed activist Milagro Sala, accusing her of leading a government parallel to that of Eduardo Fellner. According to Morales, Sala led a violent and coercive group and children were forced to join her party to attend school. When he was elected governor, Morales ordered all organizations to operate though banks instead of on a cash basis to retain their legal standing. Sala began a protest in front of the government plaza, but most of her supporters accepted Morales's edict. Prosecutor Viviana Montiel asked local judge Ra√∫l Guti√©rrez to order Sala's arrest for causing a disturbance and encouraging crime. Guti√©rrez agreed, and Sala was arrested on 16 January 2016. After Sala's arrest, she was charged with embezzlement in connection with housing construction. Although her initial charges were dropped, she remained in jail on the later ones. The case generated international criticism, and the United Nations and the Organization of American States requested her release. Macri said that the case was under provincial, not federal, jurisdiction. Amnesty International considers ‚Äúthat Milagro Sala is being criminalized for peacefully exercising her rights to freedom of expression and protest‚Äù and, along with other human rights groups, have called for the granting of precautionary measures to guarantee the liberty of Milagro Sala, along with the exercise of freedom of expression and the right to social protest in Argentina.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fWKNz5ehGAQWjXSsapl4fde0vHgeIjLWAY6svyh7u-I/edithttp://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/uaa01316_0.pdfhttp://www.cels.org.ar/comunicacion/?info=detalleDoc&ids;=4‚ü®=es&ss;=46&idc;=2026 https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/opinion/what-obama-should-know-about- macris-argentina.html?_r=0 The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, which continues in the province. Death of Santiago Maldonado Demonstration in support of Maldonado during the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice. The Benetton Group has territories at the Chubut Province, and the Mapuche indigenous people claim that those territories belonged to them. Facundo Jones Huala, from the Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche group, was jailed because of violent protests, and a group of eight people organized a picketing protest at the National Route 40, advocating for his liberation. The road was completely blocked by stones, trees and fire. Judge Guido Otranto instructed the Argentine National Gendarmerie (GNA) to clear the blockade and disperse the protesters. The protesters reacted violently, then escaped from the GNA. Some of them swam across the nearby Chubut River and others hid in the adjacent forest. One of those protesters was Santiago Maldonado, and his whereabouts were unknown after the incident. Kirchnerist and human-rights organizations considered that Maldonado was a victim of a forced disappearance, and posited that he could be the first victim of a wider plan of political repression.Novaro, p. 16 Other theories were proposed during the investigation: that he escaped to Chile, that he was hiding, or that he had been murdered some days before in an unrelated crime and was never in the protest at all (the protesters wore hoods). It was also proposed that he could have drowned, but the Mapuches held control of the area and impeded access by the GNA. When the GNA did enter the area, the corpse was found in the river. An autopsy confirmed his identity, that the body had no signs of blows or injuries, and that he died by asphyxia and hypotermia. The judicial case was closed a year later, as the judge ruled that there was no forced disappearance and that there was no further evidence pointing towards anything other than an accidental drowning.

It is paired with the 81 in the Zakk Wylde signature EMG set. It was originally designed to be used in the bridge position but is typically installed in the neck position by modern guitar producers. The EMG 85 can be recognized by a humbucker form-factor and gold embossed EMG logo. The EMG 85-7 is the seven string version of the 85.  History and design  The EMG 85 changed the previous EMG 58 pickup in the EMG product lineup as a popular rhythm pickup. Technologically, EMG 85 is an active humbucker with bar-shaped Alnico 5 magnet. The bar-shaped magnet affects strings uniformly, without irregularities known in more traditional design with separate pole pieces. Alnico 5 magnets also contribute to a warmer tone than that normally associated with ceramic magnets, which is why some players often use the 85 in the bridge, as opposed to the 81. As the EMG 85 is an active humbucker, its two coils are not just connected in series or parallel with single output. Instead, they have two separate outputs and are summed electronically in the preamp. However, such sealed solution makes it impossible to do coil taps or coil splits. The EMG 89 is a recommended pickup with a coil tap/split option. As is the case with most other modern EMG pickups, the EMG 85 has a 3-wire quik-connect output, which consists of a 3-pin male connector on the pickup body and a 3-wire cable to connect it. The easy wire color code scheme that is the same for all EMG products simplifies soldering and installation.  18V Mod  The EMG 85 power source can be modified from 9V to 18V by adding a second 9V battery wired in series. This increases the headroom of the pickup and decreases distortion, particularly with regard to transients.http://www.emgpickups.com/pdfs/faq/EMG-FAQ-Battery-Questions.pdf Although the majority of EMG's pickups are rated for 27V operation, they recommend a maximum of 18V, citing the negligible performance increase. There are two main ways to perform this modification. One method involves using separate battery harnesses for each battery. There are several different ways to achieve this, and wiring diagrams can be found all over the internet.http://home.comcast.net/~mgollihur/emgmod.html The other involves using a separate 9V snap leading to the control cavity to wire two batteries in series outside of the battery compartment.

Its subject is love, as seen from a Christian perspective, and God's place within all love. Charity is one of the three theological virtues; and the other two (hope and faith) were treated in two successive encyclicals, one signed by Benedict (Spe Salvi) and one written substantially by him but signed by his successor Pope Francis (Lumen fidei). This text begins with a reflection on the forms of love known in Greek philosophy‚Äîeros (possessive, often sexual, love), agape (unconditional, self-sacrificing love), philia (friendship)‚Äîand their relationship with the teachings of Jesus. The encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in German, his mother tongue, in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by John Paul II.Pope's first encyclical is disquisition on love and sex (The Times, 25 January 2006) The document was signed by Pope Benedict on Christmas Day, 25 December 2005.The pope needs a theologian? Former papal adviser reveals why (Free Republic, 1 January 2006, from Thavis, John, Catholic News Service, 30 December 2005) Some reports attribute the delay to problems in translating the original German text into Latin, others to disputes within the Vatican over the precise wording of the document.Love should not be confused with lust, says Pope (The Telegraph, 18 January 2006)Pope's first encyclical on love and sex is lost in translation (The Times, 19 January 2006) The encyclical was promulgated on 25 January 2006, in Latin and officially translated into seven other languages (English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish). It is the first encyclical to be published since the Vatican decided to assert copyright in the official writings of the Pope.Vatican 'cashes in' by putting price on the Pope's copyright (The Times, 23 January 2006) Title The Latin title of an encyclical is taken from its first few words. This encyclical begins with a quotation from the Vulgate, First Epistle of John, translated from the original Greek, (Ho Theos agape estin1 John 4:16 Multilingual at Bible Hub.). The Douai Bible translates this into English as , while in most contemporary English translations it reads \\"God is love\\" (since the word \\"charity\\" is derived from ). The Latin version of the First Epistle of John uses the same formulation, Deus caritas est, at the end of translating .1 John 4:8 Multilingual at Bible Hub. This second biblical reference is not mentioned in the encyclical.Latin. Retrieved 12 April 2017.English. Retrieved 12 April 2017. Summary In this encyclical, Benedict reflects on the concepts of eros, agape, and philia, and their relationship with the teachings of Jesus. Eros and agape are two of the various Greek words for love, each of which has a slightly different shade of meaning: agape is descending, oblative love in which one gives of oneself to another; eros is ascending, possessive love which seeks to receive from another; philia is the mutual love between friends. For Benedict, agape purifies eros. The document explains that eros and agape are both inherently good, but that eros risks being downgraded to mere sex if it is not balanced by an element of spiritual Christianity. The opinion that eros is inherently good follows a school of thought in the Catholic Church known as the \\"Caritas tradition\\", and contrasts with the view expressed, for example, by Anders Nygren, a Lutheran bishop, in his mid-20th century book Eros and Agape, that agape is the only truly Christian kind of love, and that eros is an expression of the individual's desires and turns us away from God.Pope on divine love vs. erotic love (Chicago Sun-Times, 4 January 2006) These two positions have been an ongoing cause for debate in both Catholic and Protestant theology. The continuity of these two forms of love follows the traditional Catholic understanding, which is influenced by the philosophy of Plato, Augustine, Bonaventure and ancient Jewish tradition. The Nygren position was favoured by the Reformed theologian Karl Barth while the Caritas position was supported by the liberal Protestant theologian Paul Tillich. The first half of the encyclical is more philosophical, tracing the meaning of the Greek words for \\"love\\". In considering eros, Benedict refers to a line from Virgil's Eclogues, Book X, line 69, \\"Omnia vincit amor, et nos cedamus amori\\" (\\"Love conquers all, let us also yield to love\\"), and the opinion of Friedrich Nietzsche that Christianity has poisoned eros, turning it into a vice. He refers to the conjugal love exhibited in the Song of Songs, and analyzes passages from the First Letter of St. John which inspired the title. The encyclical argues that eros and agape are not distinct kinds of love, but are separate halves of complete love, unified as both a giving and receiving. Dante and Beatrice gaze upon the highest Heaven; from Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations to the Divine Comedy, Paradiso, Canto XXXI. The second half, based on a report prepared by the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, is less abstract, considering the charitable activities of the Church as an expression of love which draws its power from contemplative union with God. The second half also refers to the Church's threefold responsibility: proclaiming the word of God (kerygma-martyria), celebrating the sacraments (leitourgia), and exercising the ministry of charity (diakonia). The encyclical says that social justice is the primary responsibility of politics and the laity; the church itself should inform the debate on social justice with reason guided by faith, but its main social activity should be directed towards charity. Charity workers should have a deep prayer life, and be uninfluenced by party and ideology. Benedict rejects both Marxist arguments that the poor \\"do not need charity but justice\\", and the merger of church and state functions (theocracy); rather, he encourages cooperation between the church, the state, and other Christian charitable organizations. Paragraph 39 appears to be inspired by Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, reflecting in particular the last canto of \\"Paradise\\", which ends before \\"the everlasting Light that is God himself, before that Light which at the same time is the love which moves the sun and the other stars\\".Pope Points to \\"Divine Comedy\\" (ZENIT, 23 January 2006) The three concluding paragraphs consider the example of the saints, ending with a prayer to the Virgin Mary. The text mentions the name of Mother Teresa four times, the last as a \\"saint\\" (despite the fact that she was not yet canonised) in such company as Francis of Assisi, Ignatius of Loyola, John of God, Camillus of Lellis, Vincent de Paul, Louise de Marillac, Giuseppe B. Cottolengo, John Bosco, and Luigi Orione. Deus caritas est, like the encyclicals of many previous popes, including Pope John Paul II, uses the Royal we in the official Latin text (\\"cupimus loqui de amore\\"). This is the text that appears promulgated in the Vatican's official gazette of record, \\"Acta Apostolicae Sedis\\". However, in accordance with a practice initiated in the pontificate of John Paul II, the unofficial versions prepared by the Vatican in 7 other languages use the singular (\\"I wish to speak of love\\"). Key passages *Opening passage. ‚ÄúGod is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him‚Äù (1 Jn 4:16). These words from the First Letter of John express with remarkable clarity the heart of the Christian faith: the Christian image of God and the resulting image of mankind and its destiny. In the same verse, Saint John also offers a kind of summary of the Christian life: ‚ÄúWe have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us‚Äù. We have come to believe in God's love: in these words the Christian can express the fundamental decision of his life. (¬ß1) *Reasons for the encyclical. In a world where the name of God is sometimes associated with vengeance or even a duty of hatred and violence, this message is both timely and significant. For this reason, I wish in my first Encyclical to speak of the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others.... I wanted here‚Äîat the beginning of my Pontificate‚Äîto clarify some essential facts concerning the love which God mysteriously and gratuitously offers to man, together with the intrinsic link between that Love and the reality of human love. (¬ß1) *Fulfillment of the true nature of love. Eros and agape‚Äîascending love and descending love‚Äîcan never be completely separated. The more the two, in their different aspects, find a proper unity in the one reality of love, the more the true nature of love in general is realized... On the other hand, man cannot live by oblative, descending love alone. He cannot always give, he must also receive. Anyone who wishes to give love must also receive love as a gift... Yet to become such a source, one must constantly drink anew from the original source, which is Jesus Christ, from whose pierced heart flows the love of God... Only in the way of contemplation will he be able to take upon himself the needs of others and make them his own. (¬ß7) *\\"The love which God lavishes upon us.\\" The one God...loves with a personal love. His love, moreover, is an elective love: among all the nations he chooses Israel and loves her‚Äî-but he does so precisely with a view to healing the whole human race. God loves, and his love may certainly be called eros, yet it is also totally agape... This is not only because it is bestowed in a completely gratuitous manner, without any previous merit, but also because it is love which forgives... [I]n Jesus Christ, it is God himself who goes in search of the ‚Äústray sheep‚Äù, a suffering and lost humanity... His death on the Cross is the culmination of that turning of God against himself in which he gives himself in order to raise man up and save him. This is love in its most radical form. By contemplating the pierced side of Christ (cf. Jn 19:37), we can understand the starting-point of this Encyclical Letter: ‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù (1 Jn 4:8). It is there that this truth can be contemplated. It is from there that our definition of love must begin. In this contemplation the Christian discovers the path along which his life and love must move. (¬ß9-10, 12, italics added) *Transition to Part Two. Love of God and love of neighbour are thus inseparable, they form a single commandment. But both live from the love of God who has loved us first. No longer is it a question, then, of a ‚Äúcommandment‚Äù imposed from without and calling for the impossible, but rather of a freely-bestowed experience of love from within, a love which by its very nature must then be shared with others. Love grows through love. Love is ‚Äúdivine‚Äù because it comes from God and unites us to God. (¬ß18) *Summary on justice and charity, and the Church's role. The Church cannot and must not take upon herself the political battle to bring about the most just society possible. She cannot and must not replace the State. Yet at the same time she cannot and must not remain on the sidelines in the fight for justice. She has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice, which always demands sacrifice, cannot prevail and prosper. A just society must be the achievement of politics, not of the Church. Yet the promotion of justice through efforts to bring about openness of mind and will to the demands of the common good is something which concerns the Church deeply... The Church's charitable organizations, on the other hand, constitute an opus proprium, a task agreeable to her, in which she does not cooperate collaterally, but acts as a subject with direct responsibility, doing what corresponds to her nature. (¬ß28-29, italics added) *Urgent need. Prayer, as a means of drawing ever new strength from Christ, is concretely and urgently needed...In the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta we have a clear illustration of the fact that time devoted to God in prayer not only does not detract from effective and loving service to our neighbour but is in fact the inexhaustible source of that service...It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work... A personal relationship with God and an abandonment to his will can prevent man from being demeaned and save him from falling prey to the teaching of fanaticism and terrorism...Even in their bewilderment and failure to understand the world around them, Christians continue to believe in the ‚Äúgoodness and loving kindness of God‚Äù (Tit 3:4). Immersed like everyone else in the dramatic complexity of historical events, they remain unshakably certain that God is our Father and loves us, even when his silence remains incomprehensible. (¬ß36-38, italics added) *Charity and evangelization. Charity, furthermore, cannot be used as a means of engaging in what is nowadays considered proselytism...But this does not mean that charitable activity must somehow leave God and Christ aside. For it is always concerned with the whole man. Often the deepest cause of suffering is the very absence of God. (¬ß31) *Summary of reflections on love. \\"If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing\\" (1 Cor 13:3). This hymn must be the Magna Carta of all ecclesial service; it sums up all the reflections on love which I have offered throughout this Encyclical Letter. Practical activity will always be insufficient, unless it visibly expresses a love for man, a love nourished by an encounter with Christ. (¬ß34) *Invitation of the Encyclical. Love is the light‚Äîand in the end, the only light‚Äîthat can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world‚Äîthis is the invitation I would like to extend with the present Encyclical.\\" (¬ß39) *Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main questions arise from reflecting on the nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and is it possible for love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says \\"If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen\\". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical. *Conclusion of the Encyclical. The saints are the true bearers of light within history, for they are men and women of faith, hope and love...Outstanding among the saints is Mary, Mother of the Lord and mirror of all holiness....‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù (Lk 1:46). In these words she expresses her whole programme of life: not setting herself at the centre, but leaving space for God, who is encountered both in prayer and in service of neighbour‚Äîonly then does goodness enter the world...The testimonials of gratitude, offered to her from every continent and culture, are a recognition of that pure love which is not self- seeking but simply benevolent. At the same time, the devotion of the faithful shows an infallible intuition of how such love is possible: it becomes so as a result of the most intimate union with God, through which the soul is totally pervaded by him‚Äîa condition which enables those who have drunk from the fountain of God's love to become in their turn a fountain from which ‚Äúflow rivers of living water‚Äù (Jn 7:38). Mary, Virgin and Mother, shows us what love is and whence it draws its origin and its constantly renewed power. (¬ß40-42, italics added) Other events At an audience on 18 January 2006, Pope Benedict said that Deus caritas est would discuss the concept of love \\"in its various dimensions, from the love between man and woman to the love that the Catholic Church has for others in its expression of charity\\". The Vatican, through the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, sponsored a conference in Rome to discuss the themes of the encyclical on 23 January and 24 January 2006, involving Liliana Cavani (director of films including The Night Porter and Ripley's Game) and James Wolfensohn (former head of the World Bank).Press release from Pontifical Council Cor Unum The encyclical was published on the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul and on the last day of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity. Pope Benedict led an ecumenical prayer service at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, a traditional site for such celebrations, on the evening after the encyclical was published. Presiding at vespers, he said in his homily: \\"God is love. On this solid rock the entire faith of the church is based.\\"Pope says faith that God is love should help Christian unity work (Catholic News Service, 25 January 2006) See also * Caritas Internationalis * Interior life (Catholic theology) * Trinity and love ReferencesExternal links *Full text of the encyclical of Pope Benedict XVI Deus caritas est on the Vatican Website in English *Full text of the encyclical in other languages *Commentary on the Encyclical by Catholic Educator's Resource Center *Benedict XVI's own introduction to the Encyclical *Theological assessment of the encyclical's content and importance Category:Papal encyclicals Category:Catholic theology of the body Category:Documents of the Catholic Social Teaching tradition Category:Love Category:Documents of Pope Benedict XVI Category:2006 in Christianity Category:December 2005 events in Europe Category:2006 documents ","title":"Deus caritas est"},{"id":"3592651","text":"The list of shipwrecks in 1946 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during 1946.

While an ambitious project, it was a massive financial failure. Overview and history NBC, which had broadcast rights to the Games, thought that viewers would be willing to pay US$95 to $170 to see events live, which would normally be shown on tape delay on the network in prime time. It partnered with Cablevision, the prominent New York cable provider, to create three channels: Red, White, and Blue. A special three-button remote control with the colors of the channels as the buttons was offered by some cable operators for free as a lure to sign up for the service.Article at findarticles.com Channels aired twelve hours a day (from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET) then repeated their content for the other twelve hours.\\"Triplecast Ads Are Cited.\\" New York Times 17 Jul. 1992: 10. Programs came from the world feed.Sarni, Jim. \\"Quick Remote Trigger Is A Triplecast Must\\", Miami Sun-Sentinel, 27 July 1992. As an inducement for people to order the Triplecast, NBC featured star announcers and pundits, such as Chick Hearn for basketball. This was nothing new for NBC as the network employed Vin Scully for its World Series telecasts.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkYon5qjWI Channel programs * The Blue channel featured swimming events during the first week and track and field events during the second week. * The White channel featured many individual sports, such as gymnastics, boxing, rowing, equestrian and other minor sports. * The Red channel featured team sports, such as basketball, baseball, volleyball, water polo, and team handball. Issues Several issues plagued the Triplecast. Logistics Cable providers took a lower profit cut than they normally do for pay-per-view events. A national center was also set up (1-800-OLYMPIC) to take calls, but it often had trouble telling if a viewer's cable system was participating. In January 1992, for instance, Chuck Dolan, head of Cablevision, tested the ordering system, which could not tell if his Cablevision Long Island system was carrying the Triplecast.Sandomir, Richard. \\"OLYMPICS; Triplecast: An Olympian Blunder or Innovation?\\", The New York Times, 29 June 1992. Low uptake The biggest issue with Triplecast was low uptake. NBC estimated two million people would subscribe to the programming.Zoglin, Richard; Ty, William. \\"How Much Is Too Much?\\" TIME 10 Aug. 1992: 64. But TripleCast projections were around 200,000-250,000, and the Pay- Per-View Update industry newsletter estimated only 125,000. Early reports of slow sales even inspired David Letterman, then still at NBC, to make jokes about the Triplecast. Midway through the games, discounts were applied for one-day service and weekend packages were added. But the attempts to boost subscription largely failed. Another attempt to boost interest was made, by airing a three-way split screen of the TripleCast channels in hour-long blocks on CNBC, but with no audio. The final tally of Olympics Triplecast subscribers was 200,000. It was enough of a flop that Chuck Dolan was already acknowledging by August 6 that \\"the public didn't find enough incremental value for the Triplecast over what they could get on NBC\\" and that \\"we blew it from an economic point of view.\\" It also surfaced that research figures were enhanced. While one percent of surveyed viewers said they would \\"definitely\\" buy the TripleCast, that number was enhanced in press materials by adding those who declared they would \\"probably\\" buy the service.Sandomir, Richard. \\"BARCELONA; Overpricing of Olympics' Triplecast Service Is Acknowledged\\", The New York Times 6 Aug. 1992: 14. Cannibalizing the main coverage The TripleCast service took a very austere, no-frills approach to broadcasting that included play-by-play and commentary, but few graphics and absolutely no feature stories or background vignettes. According to some TripleCast viewers, this made the main NBC coverage seem \\"schmaltzy and overproduced\\". In addition, NBC's main coverage was denigrated to some extent, with Triplecast viewers knowing some results 10 hours or more before the events were aired on the main network. Advertising Original Triplecast advertising promoted that the service was \\"live with no interruptions\\" ‚Äî though half of the broadcast day was a repeat. The New York City Consumer Affairs Department charged NBC and Cablevision with deception in advertising as a result. Eventually, the parties settled, with NBC and Cablevision agreeing to clarify the advertising.\\"OLYMPICS; Settlement In Triplecast Ads.\\" The New York Times 22 July 1992: 10. In addition, about 10 percent of NBC's 205 affiliates refused to run Triplecast advertising because they did not want to promote competition for their broadcast. Legacy Even before the Olympics started, many criticized the business model. On July 16, nine days before the Opening Ceremony, one Philadelphia Inquirer writer called it \\"the biggest marketing disaster since New Coke\\".Macnow, Glen. \\"Triplecast May Be A National Failure At This Year's Games NBC Needs A Huge Viewing Audience To Make Its $401 Million Gamble On The Olympics Pay Off. So Far, It's Not Even Close.\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, 16 July 1992. The Triplecast was deemed by The New York Times \\"sports TV's biggest flop\\" and that NBC and Cablevision were \\"bereft in sanity\\" in operating it.Sandomir, Richard. \\"Click, Click, Click: The Year In Gaffes\\", The New York Times 25 December 1992: 8. By 1994, it was referred to as \\"the Heaven's Gate of television\\".Sandomir, Richard. \\"SPORTS BUSINESS; Some Shaky Precedents for New York Sports Fans.\\" New York Times 28 Aug. 1994: 35. Albert Kim, the editor of Entertainment Weekly, went on National Public Radio and called it \\"an unmitigated disaster for NBC\\".DePrez, Greg. \\"The Olympics TripleCast: still revolutionary, still relevant\\", Multichannel News 22 June 1996. It was a loss of about $100 million (half of which was covered by Cablevision under agreement) for the two parties. It also shaped NBC's strategies in the coverage of future Olympics. NBC did not use pay-per-view to cover any future games. While NBC alone broadcast the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in the United States, NBC decided to use cable television partners for its subsequent telecasts. CBS, which had the broadcast rights to the 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympic Games, also used a cable partner, TNT. *CNBC and MSNBC showed the 2000 Summer Games and 2002 Winter Games along with NBC, and three newer acquisitions (Bravo and USA Network in English and Telemundo in Spanish) joined the coverage for the 2004 Summer Games. Universal HD was added for the 2006 Winter Games. This arrangement continued, with Oxygen taking the place of Bravo for the 2008 Games, and excluded from the 2010 Games due to a lack of programming (NBC's digital subchannel Universal Sports began to air analysis shows during those Games). The NBC Sports Network showed all U.S. Olympic events in the 2012 Olympic Games. *For the 2008 Summer Olympics, NBC offered to cable operators the NBC Olympic Basketball Channel and NBC Olympic Soccer Channel, which broadcast exclusively in high definition and aired all the events in both sports without any commercial interruptions. During halftimes and before each game, a wide-angle shot of the venue from the default world feed was shown instead along with highlights without commentary, while non- programming hours consisted of rolling statistics or a test pattern; later years now feature a continuous loop of the previous day's action. The network also used the same setup for the 2012 and 2016 Games. *During the 2008 Summer Olympics, NBC also streamed 2,200 hours of 25 different sports live on NBCOlympics.com. Most events shown on NBCOlympics.com were shown with no commentary. The number of hours of coverage has expanded further for each succeeding Games. *For the 2018 Winter Olympics, the addition of the new Olympic Channel will allow further expansion overall to the network's schedule of coverage. NBC currently holds the U.S. rights to the Olympics through 2032.

The term is derived from Italian segue, \\"follows\\". In music In music, segue is a direction to the performer. It means continue (the next section) without a pause. The term attacca is used synonymously. For written music it implies a transition from one section to the next without any break. In improvisation, it is often used for transitions created as a part of the performance, leading from one section to another. In live performance, a segue can occur during a jam session, where the improvisation of the end of one song progresses into a new song. Segues can even occur between groups of musicians during live performance. For example, as one band finishes its set, members of the following act replace members of the first band one by one, until a complete band swap occurs. In recorded music, a segue is a seamless transition between one song and another. The effect is often achieved through beatmatching, especially on dance and disco recordings, or through arrangements that create the effect of a musical suite, a classical style also used in many progressive rock recordings. The songs may further contain a lyrical connection or overall theme as well. With breakless joins of the elements in his albums Frank Zappa made extensive use of the segue technique. Extract of page 290 This was first used in 1966 on Zappa's Freak Out!, and a year later on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In some Brazilian musical styles, where it is called \\"emendar\\" (\\"to splice\\"), in particular in Samba and Forr√≥ P√© de Serra, it is very commonly used in live performances, creating sets that usually last around 20 minutes but can sometimes take more than an hour, switching seamlessly between different songs. The larger rhythm groups of bands, with up to ten percussionists in Samba for example, facilitate the switching of one song to another, as the percussionists keep the rhythm or beat going while the pitch instruments prepare the harmonical transition to the next song, often with just one pitch instrument leading this transition. In Forr√≥ trios, where the only pitch instrument (apart from the voice) is the accordion (which plays together with two percussionists), the accordionist usually \\"puxa\\" (\\"pulls\\") the next song as soon as the previous has finished. Some album notations distinguish track listings through the use of symbols, such as a >, ‚Üí, or / to indicate songs that flow seamlessly. The alternative rock band Failure separates these musical transitions into individual tracks, which are simply given numerical distinctions such as Segue 1. This system began with their 1996 album Fantastic Planet. In film or broadcast news production In audio/visual media, a segue is smooth transition from one scene or topic to another. A segue allows the director or show host to naturally proceed from one scene or topic to another without jarring the audience. A good segue makes the transition look natural and effortless.

It centers on an elaborate bank heist on Wall Street over a 24-hour period. The film stars Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, the NYPD's hostage negotiator, Clive Owen as Dalton Russell, the mastermind who orchestrates the heist, and Jodie Foster as Madeleine White, a Manhattan power broker who becomes involved at the request of the bank's founder, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), to keep something in his safe deposit box protected from the robbers. Gewirtz spent five years developing the premise before working on what became his first original screenplay. After he completed the script in 2002, Imagine Entertainment purchased it to be made by Universal Pictures, with the former company's co- founder Ron Howard attached to direct. After Howard stepped down, his Imagine partner Brian Grazer began looking for a new director for the project and ultimately hired Lee. Principal photography began in June 2005 and concluded in August; filming took place on location in New York City. Inside Man premiered in New York on March 20, 2006, before being released in the United States on March 24, 2006. It received positive reviews from critics and earned $184.4 million worldwide against its $45 million production budget. Plot A man named Dalton Russell sits in an unidentified cell and narrates how he has committed the perfect robbery. In New York, masked robbers, dressed as painters and using variants of the name \\"Steve\\" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don painters clothes identical to their own. The robbers rotate the hostages among various rooms and occasionally insert themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on an unspecified project involving demolishing the floor in one of the bank's storage rooms. Police surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food, and the police supply them with pizzas whose boxes include listening devices. The bugs pick up a language which a worker identifies as Albanian. They discover that the conversations are in fact propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance. When Arthur Case, chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, learns of the robbery taking place, he hires \\"fixer\\" Madeleine White to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. White arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum if he destroys the contents of the box. Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell takes him on a tour of the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another of the robbers. Afterwards he explains that he deliberately tried to provoke Russell and judges that the man is not a killer. However, this is seemingly disproven when the robbers stage an elaborate (but ultimately fake) execution of a hostage. The execution prompts an Emergency Services Unit team into action. They plan to storm the bank and use rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades, remove their disguises, and exit the bank with the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props that show that the hostage execution was in fact faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case. Frazier, however, searches the bank's records and finds that safe deposit box number 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that had taken place earlier between the two of them. White confronts Case, who admits that the box contained diamonds and a ring that he had taken from a Jewish friend whom he had betrayed to the Nazis. Russell repeats his opening monologue while hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. He exits the bank and enters a van filled with his co-conspirators, some of whom had been questioned by the police. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell that reads \\"follow the ring.\\" Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond. Frazier realizes that Russell slipped the diamond into his pocket when they collided during Russell's escape from the bank. Cast * Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier: :A New York City police detective with a scandal attached to his name who is desperate to make Detective First Grade. He is assigned to negotiate with the ringleader of a Manhattan bank heist. The film marks Washington's fourth collaboration with director Spike Lee. Lee first approached Washington and gave him the opportunity to play either Frazier or Dalton Russell. Washington turned down the latter, citing concerns over the character's disguise. He cited his Broadway performance as Brutus in Julius Caesar as inspiration, stating, \\"I think it actually helped me prepare for Frazier‚ÄîRussell [Gewirtz]'s script is heavy with great dialogue. My character does a lot of talking! I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn. For me, there is a certain rhythm and cadence of New Yorkers, and this gave me the opportunity to play a New York kind of guy who's going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary.\\" * Clive Owen as Dalton Russell: :The ringleader of the elaborate bank heist. Russell first appears at the beginning of the film, breaking the fourth wall and narrating in medias res of how he will commit the perfect bank robbery. Owen nearly turned down the role; like Washington, he expressed concerns over the character's disguise of a hood, mask and sunglasses. He said, \\"To play whole scenes where you're masked, you've got on sunglasses and you're wearing a hood is very weird, because a lot of acting is often through intent, and intent is shown through the eyes. To suddenly have that taken away and have this big barrier there was very disarming.\\" Owen, however, accepted the role after further discussing the part with Lee. The script was also revised to include scenes in which Owen's face could be shown.; retrieved on August 12, 2013. * Jodie Foster as Madeleine White: :A Manhattan power broker who is hired to act as a \\"fixer\\" in response to the bank heist. Foster saw the film as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee, explaining, \\"Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making.\\" She described her character as a woman with \\"a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody ‚Äî she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me.\\" * Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case: :The chairman of the board of directors and founder of the fictional Manhattan Trust bank. In response to the bank heist, Case hires White to prevent a possible career- ending situation. Inside Man is Plummer's second collaboration with Lee and Washington, following 1992's Malcolm X. He described Case as a \\"wonderful, rich head of all sorts of organizations ‚Äî I suppose a kind of 'Enron creature' ‚Äî who runs banks and other world businesses. He has tentacles everywhere, and he's a real son-of-a-bitch who's trying to keep a secret in the process.\\" * Willem Dafoe as Captain John Darius: :A veteran captain of the NYPD Emergency Services Unit. Dafoe saw the film as opportunity to work in New York City and collaborate with Lee. He felt that the film was \\"about the city; it's about authority; it's about the mentality of crime; and it's about power ... and payback.\\" * Chiwetel Ejiofor as Detective Bill Mitchell: :A New York City police detective and Frazier's partner. The film is Ejiofor's second collaboration with Lee, after She Hate Me (2004). He first learned of the film after meeting with the director. He explained, \\"He said he wanted me to read the script and see if I wanted to be involved. Spike asks so many people to come back and work with him in different capacities and as different types of characters.\\" Appearing as Russell's accomplices are: * Kim Director as Stevie (Valerie Keepsake) * James Ransone as Steve-O (Darius Peltz) * Carlos Andr√©s G√≥mez as Steve (Kenneth Damerjian) * Bernie Rachelle as Chaim, an older Jewish man who works as a professor at Columbia Law School, who teaches courses on genocide, slave labor, and war reparation claims, who is part of the plot but was not one of the \\"Steves\\", given his age and physique. Appearing as some of the more notable hostages are Ken Leung as Wing, who was distracted in the bank before the heist by the bosomy woman (played by Samantha Ivers) standing behind him and talking loudly on her phone; Gerry Vichi as Howard Kurtz, an elderly hostage suffering chest pains who is quickly released by the robbers; Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh bank clerk whose turban is removed by the cops, which is a religious sacrilege for a Sikh male; Peter Frechette as Peter Hammond, a bank employee whose attempt to hide his cell phone from Russell results in his getting beaten up; Amir Ali Said as Brian Robinson, an 8-year-old boy who speaks with both Russell and Frazier and who plays a killing video game; Ed Onipede Blunt as Ray Robinson, Brian's father; and Marcia Jean Kurtz, who plays an older woman who initially refuses to strip and is forced to do so by Stevie. Kurtz's character is named Miriam Douglas; Kurtz played a hostage named Miriam in Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Lionel Pina, who also appeared in Dog Day Afternoon as a pizza delivery man, appears in Inside Man as a policeman who delivers pizzas at the bank's front doors. Other roles include Cassandra Freeman as Sylvia, Frazier's girlfriend; Peter Gerety as Captain Coughlin, Frazier and Mitchell's superior; Victor Colicchio as Sergeant Collins, the first officer to respond to the bank robbery; Jason Manuel Olazabal as ESU Officer Hernandez; Al Palagonia as Kevin, a sanitation worker who recognizes the language as Albanian, as he was formerly married to an Albanian-born woman; Florina Petcu as Ilina, the Albanian woman in question who explains that they are hearing recordings of Enver Hoxha; Peter Kybart as the Mayor of New York City; Anthony Mangano as an ESU officer; and Daryl Mitchell and Ashlie Atkinson as Mobile Command Officers. Production=Development The script for Inside Man was written by Russell Gewirtz, a former lawyer who conceived the idea while vacationing in several countries. A first time-screenwriter, Gewirtz studied a number of screenplays, and spent five years developing the premise. His friend Daniel M. Rosenberg assisted in developing the script, then known as \\"The Inside Man\\". After it was completed in 2002, the script was passed around several times. Rosenberg shopped it to a number of Los Angeles agencies, until Universal Pictures executives Scott Stuber and Donna Langley persuaded Gewirtz to take the script to Universal and Imagine Entertainment. Imagine purchased Gewirtz's screenplay in 2002, and the project began development at Universal, who retitled the film Inside Man. Imagine co-founder Ron Howard was attached to direct the film, but turned it down after being asked by Russell Crowe to helm Cinderella Man (2005). Howard's Imagine partner Brian Grazer began looking for a new director. After Howard stepped down, Menno Meyjes contributed to Gewirtz's screenplay, and Terry George incorporated the Nazi Germany and diamond ring elements to the script. Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film, but after he declined, Grazer thought this project was a chance to work with Spike Lee, who had already learned of Gewirtz's script. Lee said of the screenplay, \\"I liked the script and really wanted to do it. 'Dog Day Afternoon,' directed by Sidney Lumet, is one of my favorite films, and this story was a contemporary take on that kind of a movie.\\" After being cast, Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor worked together on studying their lines and understanding their characters. Lee helped prepare his actors by screening a number of heist films including Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Washington, Ejiofor, Willem Dafoe and other actors met and worked with members of the New York City Police Department, who shared their experiences and stories involving civilians and hostage situations. FilmingPrincipal photography= The film was shot on location in New York City, with principal photography beginning in June 2005. Universal Pictures provided a budget of $45 million. By filming in New York, the production was eligible for the city's \\"Made in NY\\" incentives program. Interior sets were created at the New York-based Steiner Studios, and Inside Man was the second film (after 2005's The Producers) to be shot inside the 15-acre facility. Location scouting revealed a former Wall Street bank at 20 Exchange Place had been closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar. The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch, where the bank heist occurs. \\"Without a bank, we didn't have a movie,\\" Lee explained. \\"But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot in the heart of Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street.\\" An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: \\"The space literally presents Case's power, so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don't have to push the power, because it's all around you.\\" The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society Building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan. Principal photography concluded in August after 43 days of filming. =Design= Wynn Thomas supervised the production design, continuing a 20-year collaboration with Lee. With a former Wall Street bank doubling as the fictional Manhattan Trust branch, Thomas and his team restored the former bank to its 1920s architectural structure. The first floor underwent renovations and was used as the first place where the hostages are held captive by the robbers. The bank's basement was one of several interior sets created at Steiner Studios. Thomas and his team also designed Frazier's apartment, which he described as \\"very masculine and rich and highly monochromatic in its many hues of brown.\\" He was also tasked with designing a police interrogation room, as well as the interiors of the New York City Police Department and a light-duty Mobile Command vehicle. An actual Mobile Command vehicle, supplied by LDV Inc., was used for exteriors. =Cinematography= The film was director of photography Matthew Libatique's second collaboration with Lee. Because the filmmakers intended to finish with a digital intermediate (the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting), Libatique chose to shoot the film in the Super 35 format for a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 and Vision2 Expression 500T 5229 film stocks. The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex cameras and Cooke S4 lenses. Several scenes required multiple-camera setups. Lee wanted to create a visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, \\"I said, 'We want to create a sense of control and largely centered frames with Clive's character, and we want to have movement with Denzel's.' Having three operators on the same character, I'd watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I'd worked with so many operators where I wasn't one myself.\\" Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand- held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses. The film features a number of scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) interrogating several hostages during the aftermath of the heist. Libatique described these scenes as a \\"flash- forward\\" to events, explaining that Lee \\"wanted a look that would jump out and tell you you're somewhere else.\\" Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D 5285 reversal film. Technicolor then cross-processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass, which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast. Libatique explained, \\"Basically, it unifies all the color ... When you try to apply correction, the film moves in very strange ways.\\" Post-production facility EFILM carried out the digital intermediate (DI), with Libatique overseeing the process and working with colorists Steve Bowen and Steve Scott: \\"It's difficult to match all of your shots meticulously when you have three cameras and one lighting setup, so I spent the majority of the DI just adhering to the original vision of the disparity in color temperature, which I can accentuate, versus the unified color temperature.\\" A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a Northlight film scanner, while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved \\"too dense for the Northlight to perform the task.\\" EffectsVideo game sequence= The film features a scene in which Russell (Owen) interacts with Brian Robinson (Amir Ali Said), an 8-year- old boy who is playing a violent video game titled \\"Gangstas iz Genocide\\" on his PlayStation Portable. The scene is intercut with a 30-second animated sequence of the fictional game, in which a character performs a drive-by shooting, before killing an intended target with a hand grenade. Using the Grand Theft Auto franchise as a reference, Lee wanted the scene to serve as a social commentary on gangsta rap, violent crime among African Americans and the rising level of killings in video games. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique enlisted his cousin, Eric Alba, and a team of graphic artists known as House of Pain to design the 30-second animated sequence. Lee asked for the sequence to show two black characters in a ghetto environment dressed in gangster attire. He also gave the artists mockups of two scenarios that ended in homicide‚Äîone being a robbery at an ATM, and the other a drive-by shooting. House of Pain spent 10 days working on \\"Gangstas iz Genocide\\". Alba digitally photographed images of buildings near the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, New York. Portions of the sequence were pre-visualized in 3D Studio Max, while stills were imported as texture maps and added to animated cut scenes created in 3D modeling package Maya. The artists also improvised the use of a hand grenade. When Lee saw how violent the sequence was, he improvised the line \\"Kill Dat Nigga!\\" as a subtitle. The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact. Upon Inside Man's theatrical release, he regretted the video game sequence in the film, saying, \\"The sad thing is somebody is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration.\\" Music Jazz musician and trumpeter Terence Blanchard composed the film score, marking his eleventh collaboration with Lee. The soundtrack features the song \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\", composed by A. R. Rahman, which originally appeared in the 1998 Hindi film Dil Se.. The song is featured during the opening credits of the film. A remix of the song, titled \\"Chaiyya, Chaiyya Bollywood Joint\\" plays during the end credits, and features Panjabi MC's added rap lyrics about people of different backgrounds coming together in order to survive. The soundtrack, titled Inside Man: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, was released on CD in North America on March 21, 2006, through record label Var√®se Sarabande. Release Inside Man held its premiere in New York at the Ziegfeld Theatre on March 20, 2006, coinciding with Lee's 49th birthday. On March 24, 2006, Universal Pictures released the film in 2,818 theatres in North America. The film was given the widest release of any Spike Lee film, edging out Summer of Sam (1999) by 1,282 theatres. Inside Man was also released throughout 62 foreign markets. The film was released on DVD on August 8, 2006, on HD DVD on October 23, 2007 and on Blu-ray on May 26, 2009. Box office On its opening day in North America, the film grossed $9,440,295 with an average of $3,350 per theatre. By the end of its opening weekend, it had grossed $28,954,945, securing the number one position at the box office. Inside Man held the record for the highest opening weekend gross as a Denzel Washington starring vehicle, surpassing Man on Fire (2004) which debuted with $22.7 million on its first weekend. Inside Man had dropped 46.7% in its second weekend, earning $15,437,760; it had dropped to second place behind Ice Age: The Meltdown. The film dropped an additional 40.9% in its third week, bringing in $9,131,410, though it remained in the Top 10 rankings for the weekend, placing fourth overall. The film remained in the top ten for the fourth weekend in a row, grossing approximately $6,427,815 and finishing sixth for the week. In its fifth weekend, Inside Man had grossed an additional $3,748,955, while in eighth place. In its sixth weekend, Inside Man fell out of the box office top ten, finishing eleventh with an estimated $2,081,690. The film ended its theatrical run in North America on July 6, 2006 after 15 weeks (105 days) of release. It grossed $88,513,495 in the United States and Canada, ranking as Lee's highest-grossing film, ahead of Malcolm X (1992), which had ended its North American release with over $48 million. Inside Man was released overseas on March 23, 2006. On its opening weekend, it grossed approximately $9,600,000 in ten territories. The film grossed $95,862,759 in the overseas box office, with a worldwide total of $184,376,254. In North America, it was the twenty-second highest-grossing film of 2006, while it ranked at twenty-first place as the highest-grossing film released worldwide. Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 204 reviews and an average rating of 7.33/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Spike Lee's energetic and clever bank-heist thriller is a smart genre film that is not only rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its pulpy trappings with wit and skill ‚Äì and Denzel Washington is terrific as a brilliant hostage negotiator.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 39 critics, considered to be \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that 54% of the audience was male, while 68% was at least 30 years old or older. The American Film Institute named Inside Man as one of the top ten films of 2006. Empire gave the film four stars out of five, concluding, \\"It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre. Thanks to some slick lens work and a cast on cracking form, Lee proves (perhaps above all to himself?) that playing it straight is not always a bad thing.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, \\"The basic story is elemental, but because Lee and Gewirtz invest it with grit, comedy, and a ton of New York ethnic personality, it's fresh anyway.\\" David Ansen of Newsweek commented, \\"As unexpected as some of its plot twists is the fact that this unapologetic genre movie was directed by Spike Lee, who has never sold himself as Mr. Entertainment. But here it is, a Spike Lee joint that's downright fun.\\" Giving the film a B+ rating, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described the film as \\"a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint. Or else it's a cross between a 2006 Spike Lee joint and a 1970s-style movie indictment of urban unease.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times criticized the narrative, writing, \\"Here is a thriller that's curiously reluctant to get to the payoff, and when it does, we see why: we can't accept the motive and method of the bank robbery, we can't believe in one character and can't understand another.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it a \\"supremely annoying and nonsensical film\\". Rex Reed of The New York Observer wrote, \\"Inside Man has two things going for it: better actors than usual and a slicker look. Otherwise, it's no different from nine out of 10 other preposterous, contrived, confusingly written, unevenly directed, pointless and forgettable junk films we've been getting these days.\\" Sequel In November 2006, it was announced that a sequel to Inside Man was in development, with Russell Gewirtz reprising screenwriting duties. Under the working title Inside Man 2, the film would have Brian Grazer again serve as producer. Spike Lee was in negotiations to reprise his directing duties while serving as an executive producer alongside returning member Daniel M. Rosenberg. In 2008, Terry George was in negotiations to write the screenplay for the sequel; he later replaced Gewirtz, whose screenplay was abandoned. The plot for the sequel was intended to continue after the events of the first film, with Dalton Russell (played by Clive Owen) masterminding another robbery, and again matching wits with NYPD hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). Lee confirmed that Washington, Owen, Jodie Foster and Chiwetel Ejiofor would all reprise their roles. He also expressed interest in filming Inside Man 2 during the fall of 2009. In 2011, it was announced that plans to make Inside Man 2 had been cancelled. Lee confirmed this, expressing that he could not secure funding for the project. \\"Inside Man was my most successful film, but we can't get the sequel made,\\" he said. \\"And one thing Hollywood does well is sequels. The film's not getting made. We tried many times. It's not going to happen.\\" In 2019, a sequel titled Inside Man: Most Wanted was released direct-to-video and streaming on Netflix.

The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil. In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor. The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III. Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself. After wintering in the western coastlands of Asia Minor, the Arab army crossed into Thrace in early summer 717 and built siege lines to blockade the city, which was protected by the massive Theodosian Walls. The Arab fleet, which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city's blockade by sea, was neutralized soon after its arrival by the Byzantine navy through the use of Greek fire. This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied by sea, while the Arab army was crippled by famine and disease during the unusually hard winter that followed. In spring 718, two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected, and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated. Coupled with attacks by the Bulgars on their rear, the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718. On its return journey, the Arab fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural disasters and Byzantine attacks. The siege's failure had wide-ranging repercussions. The rescue of Constantinople ensured the continued survival of Byzantium, while the Caliphate's strategic outlook was altered: although regular attacks on Byzantine territories continued, the goal of outright conquest was abandoned. Historians consider the siege to be one of history's most important battles, as its failure postponed the Muslim advance into Southeastern Europe for centuries. Background Following the first Arab siege of Constantinople (674‚Äì678), the Arabs and Byzantines experienced a period of peace. After 680, the Umayyad Caliphate was in the throes of the Second Muslim Civil War and the consequent Byzantine ascendancy in the East enabled the emperors to extract huge amounts of tribute from the Umayyad government in Damascus.. In 692, as the Umayyads emerged as victors from the Muslim Civil War, Emperor Justinian II () re- opened hostilities. The result was a series of Arab victories that led to the loss of Byzantine control over Armenia and the Caucasian principalities, and a gradual encroachment upon Byzantine borderlands. Year by year, the Caliphate's generals, usually members of the Umayyad family, launched raids into Byzantine territory and captured fortresses and towns.; ; . After 712, the Byzantine defensive system began to show signs of collapse: Arab raids penetrated further and further into Asia Minor, border fortresses were repeatedly attacked and sacked, and references to Byzantine reaction in the sources become more and more scarce.; . In this, the Arabs were aided by the prolonged period of internal instability that followed the first deposition of Justinian II in 695, in which the Byzantine throne changed hands seven times in violent coups.; ; . In the words of the Byzantinist Warren Treadgold, \\"the Arab attacks would in any case have intensified after the end of their own civil war ... With far more men, land and wealth than Byzantium, the Arabs had begun to concentrate all their strength against it. Now they threatened to extinguish the empire entirely by capturing its capital.\\". Sources The information available on the siege comes from sources composed in later dates, which are often mutually contradictory. The main Byzantine source is the extensive and detailed account of the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor (760‚Äì817) and secondarily the brief account in the Breviarium of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople (died 828), which shows small differences, mainly chronological, from Theophanes's version.. For the events of the siege, both authors appear to have used a primary account composed during the reign of Leo III the Isaurian () which therefore contains a favourable depiction of the latter, while Theophanes apparently relies on an unknown biography of Leo (ignored by Nikephoros) for the events of 716. The 8th-century chronicler Theophilus of Edessa records the years leading up to the siege and the siege itself in some detail, paying particular attention to the diplomacy between Maslama and Leo III.. The Arab sources, mainly the 11th-century Kitab al-'Uyun and the more concise narrative in the History of the Prophets and Kings by al- Tabari (838‚Äì923), rely on primary accounts by early 9th-century Arab writers, but are more confused and contain several legendary elements. The Syriac language accounts are based on Agapius of Hierapolis (died 942), who likely drew from the same primary source as Theophanes, but are far briefer., Opening stages of the campaign solidus of Anastasios II, who prepared Constantinople for the coming Arab assault The Arab successes opened the way for a second assault on Constantinople, an undertaking already initiated under Caliph al-Walid I (). Following his death, his brother and successor Sulayman () took up the project with increased vigour, according to Arab accounts because of a prophecy that a Caliph bearing the name of a prophet would capture Constantinople; Sulayman (Solomon) was the only member of the Umayyad family to bear such a name. According to Syriac sources, the new Caliph swore \\"to not stop fighting against Constantinople before having exhausted the country of the Arabs or to have taken the city\\".; ; ; ; . The Umayyad forces began assembling at the plain of Dabiq north of Aleppo, under the direct supervision of the Caliph. As Sulayman was too sick to campaign himself, however, he entrusted command to his brother Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik.. The operation against Constantinople came at a time when the Umayyad empire was undergoing a period of continuous expansion to the east and west. Muslim armies advanced into Transoxiana, India, and the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania.. Arab preparations, especially the construction of a large fleet, did not go unnoticed by the worried Byzantines. Emperor Anastasios II () sent an embassy to Damascus under the patrician and urban prefect, Daniel of Sinope, ostensibly in order to plea for peace, but in reality to spy on the Arabs. Anastasios, in turn, began to prepare for the inevitable siege: the fortifications of Constantinople were repaired and equipped with ample artillery (catapults and other siege weapons), while food stores were brought into the city. In addition, those inhabitants who could not stockpile food for at least three years were evacuated.; ; . Anastasios strengthened his navy and in early 715 dispatched it against the Arab fleet that had come to Phoenix‚Äîusually identified with modern Finike in Lycia, it may also be modern Fenaket across Rhodes,. or perhaps Phoenicia (modern Lebanon), famed for its cedar forests.‚Äîto collect timber for their ships. At Rhodes, however, the Byzantine fleet, encouraged by the soldiers of the Opsician Theme, rebelled, killed their commander John the Deacon and sailed north to Adramyttium. There, they acclaimed a reluctant tax collector, Theodosius, as emperor.; ; ; . Anastasios crossed into Bithynia in the Opsician Theme to confront the rebellion, but the rebel fleet sailed on to Chrysopolis. From there, it launched attacks against Constantinople, until, in late summer, sympathizers within the capital opened its gates to them. Anastasios held out at Nicaea for several months, finally agreeing to resign and retire as a monk.; ; . The accession of Theodosios, who from the sources comes across as both unwilling and incapable, as a puppet emperor of the Opsicians provoked the reaction of the other themes, especially the Anatolics and the Armeniacs under their respective strategoi (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos.; . Map of Byzantine Asia Minor and Thrace in the early 8th century In these conditions of near-civil war, the Arabs began their carefully prepared advance. In September 715, the vanguard, under general Sulayman ibn Mu'ad, marched over Cilicia into Asia Minor, taking the strategic fortress of Loulon on its way. They wintered at Afik, an unidentified location near the western exit of the Cilician Gates. In early 716, Sulayman's army continued into central Asia Minor. The Umayyad fleet under Umar ibn Hubayra cruised along the Cilician coast, while Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik awaited developments with the main army in Syria.; ; . The Arabs hoped that the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already established contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general intended to use the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.; . Sulayman's first objective was the strategically important fortress of Amorium, which the Arabs intended to use as a base the following winter. Amorium had been left defenceless in the turmoil of the civil war and would have easily fallen, but the Arabs chose to bolster Leo's position as a counterweight to Theodosios. They offered the city terms of surrender if its inhabitants would acknowledge Leo as emperor. The fortress capitulated, but still did not open its gates to the Arabs. Leo came to the vicinity with a handful of soldiers and executed a series of ruses and negotiations to garrison 800 men in the town. The Arab army, thwarted in its objective and with supplies running low, withdrew. Leo escaped to Pisidia and, in summer, supported by Artabasdos, was proclaimed and crowned as Byzantine emperor, openly challenging Theodosios.; ; .For a detailed examination of Leo's negotiations with the Arabs before Amorium in Byzantine and Arab sources, cf. . Gold solidus of Leo III Leo's success at Amorium was fortunately timed, since Maslama with the main Arab army had in the meantime crossed the Taurus Mountains and was marching straight for the city. In addition, as the Arab general had not received news of Leo's double-dealing, he did not devastate the territories he marched through‚Äîthe Armeniac and Anatolic themes, whose governors he still believed to be his allies.; ; . On meeting up with Sulayman's retreating army and learning what had transpired, Maslama changed direction: he attacked Akroinon and from there marched to the western coastlands to spend the winter. On his way, he sacked Sardis and Pergamon. The Arab fleet wintered in Cilicia.; ; ; . Leo, in the meantime, began his own march on Constantinople. He captured Nicomedia, where he found and captured, among other officials, Theodosios's son, and then marched to Chrysopolis. In spring 717, after short negotiations, he secured Theodosios's resignation and his recognition as emperor, entering the capital on 25 March. Theodosios and his son were allowed to retire to a monastery as monks, while Artabasdos was promoted to the position of kouropalates and received the hand of Leo's daughter, Anna.; ; ; . Opposing forces From the outset, the Arabs prepared for a major assault on Constantinople. The late 8th-century Syriac Zuqnin Chronicle reports that the Arabs were \\"innumerable\\", while the 12th-century Syriac chronicler Michael the Syrian mentions a much-inflated 200,000 men and 5,000 ships. The 10th-century Arab writer al-Mas'udi mentions 120,000 troops, and the account of Theophanes the Confessor 1,800 ships. Supplies for several years were hoarded, and siege engines and incendiary materials (naphtha) were stockpiled. The supply train alone is said to have numbered 12,000 men, 6,000 camels and 6,000 donkeys, while according to the 13th-century historian Bar Hebraeus, the troops included 30,000 volunteers (mutawa) for the Holy War (jihad).; ; . The Byzantines' strength is entirely unknown, but Constantinople's defenders likely did not number over 15,000 men, given both the exhaustion of the Byzantine Empire's manpower and the limitations imposed by the need to maintain and feed such a force. Byzantine-style lead seal of the Bulgar ruler, Tervel Whatever the true numbers, the attackers were considerably more numerous than the defenders; according to Treadgold, the Arab host may have outnumbered the entire Byzantine army. Little is known on the detailed composition of the Arab force, but it appears that it mostly consisted of, and was led by, Syrians and Jazirans of the elite ahl al-Sham (\\"People of Syria\\"), the main pillar of the Umayyad regime and veterans of the struggle against Byzantium.; . Alongside Maslama, Umar ibn Hubayra, Sulayman ibn Mu'ad, and Bakhtari ibn al-Hasan are mentioned as his lieutenants by Theophanes and Agapius of Hierapolis, while the later Kitab al-'Uyun replaces Bakhtari with Abdallah al-Battal.; . Although the siege consumed a large part of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition),. the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgar ruler Tervel, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs. Siege Map of the environs of Constantinople in Byzantine times In early summer, Maslama ordered his fleet to join him and with his army crossed the Hellespont (Dardanelles) at Abydos into Thrace. The Arabs began their march on CŒønstantinople, thoroughly devastating the countryside, gathering supplies, and sacking the towns they encountered.; ; ; . In mid-July or mid-August, the Arab army reached Constantinople and isolated it completely on land by building a double siege wall of stone, one facing the city and one facing the Thracian countryside, with their camp positioned between them. According to Arab sources, at this point Leo offered to ransom the city by paying a gold coin for every inhabitant, but Maslama replied that there could not be peace with the vanquished, and that the Arab garrison of Constantinople had already been selected.; ; ; . The Arab fleet under Sulayman (often confused with the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) arrived on 1 September, anchoring at first near the Hebdomon. Two days later, Sulayman led his fleet into the Bosphorus and the various squadrons began anchoring by the European and Asian suburbs of the city: one part sailed south of Chalcedon to the harbours of Eutropios and Anthemios to watch over the southern entrance of the Bosporus, while the rest of the fleet sailed into the strait, passed by Constantinople and began making landfall on the coasts between Galata and Kleidion, cutting the Byzantine capital's communication with the Black Sea. But as the Arab fleet's rearguard, twenty heavy ships with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind stopped and then reversed, drifting them towards the city walls, where a Byzantine squadron attacked them with Greek fire. Theophanes reported that some went down with all hands, while others, burning, sailed down to the Princes' Islands of Oxeia and Plateia. The victory encouraged the Byzantines and dejected the Arabs, who, according to Theophanes, had originally intended to sail to the sea walls during the night and try to scale them using the ships' steering paddles. The same night, Leo drew up the chain between the city and Galata, closing the entrance to the Golden Horn. The Arab fleet became reluctant to engage the Byzantines, and withdrew to the safe harbour of Sosthenion further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.; ; ; . triple Theodosian Walls protecting Constantinople from its land side The Arab army was well-provisioned, with Arab accounts reporting high mounds of supplies piled up in their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army.; . As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show the inhabitants of the city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender.; . The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.; ; ; ; . Depiction of the use of Greek fire, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes The situation looked set to improve in spring when the new Caliph, Umar II (), sent two fleets to the besiegers' aid: 400 ships from Egypt under a commander named Sufyan and 360 ships from Africa under Izid, all laden with supplies and arms. At the same time, a fresh army began marching through Asia Minor to assist in the siege. When the new fleets arrived in the Sea of Marmara, they kept their distance from the Byzantines and anchored on the Asian shore, the Egyptians in the Gulf of Nicomedia near modern Tuzla and the Africans south of Chalcedon (at Satyros, Bryas and Kartalimen). Most of the Arab fleets' crews were composed of Christian Egyptians, however, and they began deserting to the Byzantines upon their arrival. Notified by the Egyptians of the advent and disposition of the Arab reinforcements, Leo launched his fleet in an attack against the new Arab fleets. Crippled by the defection of their crews, and helpless against Greek fire, the Arab ships were destroyed or captured along with the weapons and supplies they carried. Constantinople was now safe from a seaborne attack.; ; ; . On land too the Byzantines were victorious: their troops managed to ambush the advancing Arab army under a commander named Mardasan and destroy it in the hills around Sophon, south of Nicomedia.;; ; . Constantinople could now be easily resupplied by sea and the city's fishermen went back to work, as the Arab fleet did not sail again. Still suffering from hunger and pestilence, the Arabs lost a major battle against the Bulgars, who killed, according to Theophanes, 22,000 men. The sources are divided on the details of the Bulgar participation in the siege: Theophanes and al-Tabari report that the Bulgars attacked the Arab encampment (likely because of their treaty with Leo), while according to the Syriac Chronicle of 846, it was the Arabs who strayed into Bulgar territory, seeking provisions. Michael the Syrian on the other hand mentions that the Bulgars participated in the siege from the beginning, with attacks against the Arabs as they marched through Thrace towards Constantinople, and subsequently on their encampment.; ; ; . The siege had clearly failed, and Caliph Umar sent orders to Maslama to retreat. After thirteen months of siege, on 15 August 718, the Arabs departed. The date coincided with the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (Assumption of Mary), and it was to her that the Byzantines ascribed their victory. The retreating Arabs were not hindered or attacked on their return, but their fleet lost more ships in a storm in the Marmara Sea, while other ships were set afire by ashes from the volcano of Santorini, and some of the survivors were captured by the Byzantines, so that Theophanes claims that only five vessels made it back to Syria.; . Arab sources claim that altogether 150,000 Muslims perished during the campaign, a figure which, according to the Byzantinist John Haldon, \\"while certainly inflated, is nevertheless indicative of the enormity of the disaster in medieval eyes\\".. Aftermath The expansion of the Muslim Caliphate until 750, from William R. Shepherd's Historical Atlas. The expedition's failure weakened the Umayyad state. As historian Bernard Lewis commented, \\"Its failure brought a grave moment for Umayyad power. The financial strain of equipping and maintaining the expedition caused an aggravation of the fiscal and financial oppression which had already aroused such dangerous opposition. The destruction of the fleet and army of Syria at the sea walls of Constantinople deprived the regime of the chief material basis of its power\\".. The blow to the Caliphate's might was severe, and although the land army did not suffer losses in the same degree as the fleet, Umar is recorded as contemplating withdrawing from the recent conquests of Hispania and Transoxiana, as well as a complete evacuation of Cilicia and other Byzantine territories that the Arabs had seized over the previous years. Although his advisors dissuaded him from such drastic actions, most Arab garrisons were withdrawn from the Byzantine frontier districts they had occupied in the lead-up to the siege. In Cilicia, only Mopsuestia remained in Arab hands as a defensive bulwark to protect Antioch.; ; . The Byzantines even recovered some territory in western Armenia for a time. In 719, the Byzantine fleet raided the Syrian coast and burned down the port of Laodicea and, in 720 or 721, the Byzantines attacked and sacked Tinnis in Egypt.; ; . Leo also restored control over Sicily, where news of the Arab siege of Constantinople and expectations of the city's fall had prompted the local governor to declare an emperor of his own, Basil Onomagoulos. It was during this time, however, that effective Byzantine control over Sardinia and Corsica ceased.. Besides this, the Byzantines failed to exploit their success in launching attacks of their own against the Arabs. In 720, after a hiatus of two years, Arab raids against Byzantium resumed, although now they were no longer directed at conquest, but rather seeking booty. The Arab attacks would intensify again over the next two decades, until the major Byzantine victory at the Battle of Akroinon in 740. Coupled with military defeats on the other fronts of the overextended Caliphate, and the internal instability which culminated in the Abbasid Revolution, the age of Arab expansion came to an end.; ; ; . Historical assessment and impact The second Arab siege of Constantinople was far more dangerous for Byzantium than the first as, unlike the loose blockade of 674‚Äì678, the Arabs launched a direct, well-planned attack on the Byzantine capital, and tried to cut off the city completely from land and sea.. The siege represented a final effort by the Caliphate to \\"cut off the head\\" of the Byzantine Empire, after which the remaining provinces, especially in Asia Minor, would be easy to capture.. The reasons for the Arab failure were chiefly logistical, as they were operating too far from their Syrian bases, but the superiority of the Byzantine navy through the use of Greek fire, the strength of Constantinople's fortifications, and the skill of Leo III in deception and negotiations also played important roles.; ; ; . Along with the Battle of Tours in 732, the Siege of Constantinople stopped the Muslim expansion into Europe The failure of the Arab siege led to a profound change in the nature of warfare between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The Muslim goal of conquest of Constantinople was effectively abandoned, and the frontier between the two empires stabilized along the line of the Taurus and Antitaurus Mountains, over which both sides continued to launch regular raids and counter-raids. In this incessant border warfare, frontier towns and fortresses changed hands frequently, but the general outline of the border remained unaltered for over two centuries, until the Byzantine conquests of the 10th century.; ; ; . The eastern fleets of the Caliphate entered a century-long decline; only the Ifriqiyan fleets maintained regular raids on Byzantine Sicily, until they too subsided after 752. Indeed, with the exception of the advance of the Abbasid army under Harun al-Rashid up to Chrysopolis in 782, no other Arab army would ever come within sight of the Byzantine capital again. Consequently, on the Muslim side the raids themselves eventually acquired an almost ritual character, and were valued mostly as a demonstration of the continuing jihad and sponsored by the Caliph as a symbol of his role as the leader of the Muslim community.; . The outcome of the siege was of considerable macrohistorical importance. The Byzantine capital's survival preserved the Empire as a bulwark against Islamic expansion into Europe until the 15th century, when it fell to the Ottoman Turks. Along with the Battle of Tours in 732, the successful defence of Constantinople has been seen as instrumental in stopping Muslim expansion into Europe. Historian Ekkehard Eickhoff writes that \\"had a victorious Caliph made Constantinople already at the beginning of the Middle Ages into the political capital of Islam, as happened at the end of the Middle Ages by the Ottomans‚Äîthe consequences for Christian Europe [...] would have been incalculable\\", as the Mediterranean would have become an Arab lake, and the Germanic successor states in Western Europe would have been cut off from the Mediterranean roots of their culture. Military historian Paul K. Davis summed up the siege's importance as follows: \\"By turning back the Moslem invasion, Europe remained in Christian hands, and no serious Moslem threat to Europe existed until the fifteenth century. This victory, coincident with the Frankish victory at Tours (732), limited Islam's western expansion to the southern Mediterranean world.\\". Thus the historian John B. Bury called 718 \\"an ecumenical date\\", while the Greek historian Spyridon Lambros likened the siege to the Battle of Marathon and Leo III to Miltiades.. Consequently, military historians often include the siege in lists of the \\"decisive battles\\" of world history.; ; ; ; . Cultural impact Among Arabs, the 717‚Äì718 siege became the most famous of their expeditions against Byzantium. Several accounts survive, but most were composed at later dates and are semi-fictional and contradictory. In legend, the defeat was transformed into a victory: Maslama departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital on his horse accompanied by thirty riders, where Leo received him with honour and led him to the Hagia Sophia. After Leo paid homage to Maslama and promised tribute, Maslama and his troops‚Äî30,000 out of the original 80,000 that set out for Constantinople‚Äîdeparted for Syria.; ; . The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in Arabic epic literature. A siege of Constantinople is found in the tale of Omar bin al-Nu'uman and his sons in the Thousand and One Nights, while both Maslama and the Caliph Sulayman appear in a tale of the Hundred and One Nights from the Maghreb. The commander of Maslama's bodyguard, Abdallah al-Battal, became a celebrated figure in Arab and Turkish poetry as \\"Battal Gazi\\" for his exploits in the Arab raids of the next decades. Similarly, the 10th-century epic Delhemma, related to the cycle around Battal, gives a fictionalized version of the 717‚Äì718 siege.; . Later Muslim and Byzantine tradition also ascribed the building of Constantinople's first mosque, near the city's praetorium, to Maslama. In reality, the mosque near the praetorium was probably erected in about 860, as a result of an Arab embassy in that year.; ; ; . Ottoman tradition also ascribed the building of the Arap Mosque (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s.; ; . The passing of the Arab army also left traces at Abydos, where \\"Maslama's Well\\" and a mosque attributed to him were still known in the 10th century.. Eventually, following their repeated failures before Constantinople, and the continued resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came to be regarded as one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology.; ; . The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later..

He founded the fast food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A in 1946. Early life Cathy was born on March 14, 1921, in Eatonton, Georgia, the son of Lilla James (n√©e Kimball) and Joseph Benjamin Cathy. He attended Boys High School (now Henry W. Grady High School) in Atlanta and later served in the United States Army during World War II. Cathy began the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville in 1946 with a restaurant called the Dwarf Grill, whose name arose because of its small size. It was there that he, along with his brother and business partner Ben, created the chicken sandwich that later became the signature menu item for Chick-fil-A. The original restaurant (since renamed Dwarf House) is still in operation, and the company operates other Dwarf House locations in the metro Atlanta area. He married Jeannette, and they had three children: Trudy, Don \\"Bubba\\", and Dan. Career Cathy was a member of the First Baptist Church in Jonesboro, Georgia, and taught Sunday School there for more than 50 years. He said that the Bible is his guide-book for life.Cathy, S. Truett, It's Easier To Succeed Than Fail, Oliver-Nelson Books (1989); . Due to his strong religious beliefs, all of the company's locations, whether company-owned or franchised, are closed on Sundays to allow its employees to attend church and spend time with their families. This policy began when Cathy was working six days a week, multiple shifts. He decided to close on Sundays. Cathy wrote five books: the autobiography Eat Mor Chikin: Inspire More People, a motivational book entitled It's Easier to Succeed Than to Fail, the parenting book It's Better to Build Boys Than Mend Men, an explanation of his business success in How Did You Do It, Truett?, and a final book on the significance of money in today's society titled Wealth, Is It Worth It?. He also contributed to the anthologies What My Parents Did Right and Conversations on Success, and co-wrote with Ken Blanchard Generosity Factor: Discover the Joy of Giving Your Time, Talent, and Treasure. McDonough- Fayetteville Road in Fayette, Henry, and Clayton counties, is named in his honor. Cathy said that the motivational book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill was one of the greatest foundations for inspiration growing up.Cathy, S. Truett Eat Mor Chikin: Inspire More People, 2002. Looking Glass Books; . In April 2008, he opened Upscale Pizza in Fayetteville, Georgia. In November 2013, he retired as both chairman and CEO of Chick-fil-A, leaving his son, Dan Cathy, to assume the roles. Death S. Truett Cathy died at his home on September 8, 2014 of diabetic complications at the age of 93. The family held a public funeral service on Wednesday, September 10, at First Baptist Church, Jonesboro, Georgia. His interment was at Greenwood Cemetery. His widow, Jeannette Cathy, died in 2015 at age 92. Philanthropy Summer camp for girls at Berry CollegeCathy was closely involved with the sponsorship of the college football bowl game now known as the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but from 1997-2005 known as the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, and prior to that simply as the Peach Bowl. On October 28, 2006, Cathy received the last Taurus off the assembly line of Ford's Atlanta plant, in recognition of a 60-year relationship between him and the plant. The plant, located near Cathy's original Dwarf Grill (now Dwarf House), opened one year after the restaurant opened, and Truett regularly served during all three shifts at the plant. Cathy had a Leadership Scholarship program for Chick-fil-A restaurant employees, which has awarded more than $23 million in $1,000 scholarships in the past 35 years. In 1984, Cathy established the WinShape Foundation, named for its mission to shape winners. In addition, Cathy fostered children for more than 30 years. He received the William E.

In addition to being inducted into the Society, the university conferred upon Cathy an honorary doctorate of business. In May 2012, Cathy received an honorary doctorate along with presidential candidate Mitt Romney at the Liberty University's spring commencement ceremony. In his remarks, Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee at the time, said, \\"The Romney campaign comes to a sudden stop when we spot a Chick-fil-A.

Parrish (born December 13, 1947) is a former professional American football player who played defensive back in the National Football League for the Cincinnati Bengals (1970‚Äì1977), Washington Redskins (1978‚Äì1982), and Buffalo Bills (1982). Early life Parrish played football and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Riviera Beach, Florida.http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=PARRILEM01 College career He played college football for Lincoln University of Missouri in Jefferson City, Missouri. He was a running back and a four-year letter-winner from 1966 to 1969. In 1969, he set the school's record for longest punt return when he returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown against Southwest Missouri State University. He also set school records for most punt return yards in a game (129 yards on three returns) and highest average per punt return in that game (43 yards per return). That year, Parrish averaged 16.8 yards per punt return. That, and his career average of 15.5 yards per return, are still school records. He was named All-American in 1969.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/153271-crazy-canton-cuts-lemar-parrish Professional career=Cincinnati Bengals After graduating college, he was selected by the Bengals in the seventh round of the 1970 NFL Draft. Parrish immediately made an impact, not just as a defensive back but also as a kick returner on special teams. In his 1970 rookie season, Parrish recorded five interceptions, one fumble recovery, 194 yards returning punts, 482 yards returning kickoffs, and scored two touchdowns (one punt return and one kickoff return). His 482 kickoff return yards came on just 16 returns, a whopping 30.1 yards per return average. In 1974, Parrish set a franchise record with an NFL- leading 18.8 yards per punt return average (18 returns for 338 yards).

He was also the only player in franchise history ever to score two \\"return or recovery\\" touchdowns in a single game, a feat he accomplished three times.http://www.cincyjungle.com/2011/4/27/2137120/best-bengals-draft- pick-2-lemar-parrish In a 1970 game against the Bills, he scored touchdowns on a 95-yard kickoff return and an 83-yard blocked field goal return. In a 1972 game against the Houston Oilers, he scored touchdowns on interception returns of 25 and 33 yards. In a 1974 game against Washington, he scored touchdowns on a 93-yard punt return and 47-yard fumble return. Parrish also left as the Bengals' all-time leader in punt return yards with 1,201, and held the franchise record for punt return yards in a season with 338 in 1974.http://www.cincyjungle.com/2011/4/27/2137120/best-bengals-draft- pick-2-lemar-parrish Washington Redskins With the Redskins, Parrish was no longer used as a kick returner, but he still made a big impact, recording nine interceptions in his first year with them, and seven the year after that. He made the Pro Bowl two more times with Washington, in 1979 and 1980. Parrish played with Redskins until 1981. Buffalo Bills Parrish spent his final season with Bills before retiring in 1982.

She was instrumental in helping to warn the militia of the coming British before the Battle of Cowpens in 1781. According to legend, she tied her toddler to the bedpost while she rode out to warn neighbors that the British were coming. Her warning helped to prepare the colonial forces to defeat the British governor, Cornwallis and his men and drive them north, out of the state of South Carolina. She is buried in the family cemetery in Moore, South Carolina, beside her husband, Andrew, who was one of the first elders of the Nazareth Presbyterian Church. She knew the Indian trails and shortcuts where almost no patriots lived. Barry was a spy and message bearer for the militia when the Battle of Cowpens was fought on January 17, 1781. The Battle of Cowpens (January 17, 1781) was a decisive victory by Continental army forces under Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, in the Southern campaign of the American Revolutionary War. It was a turning point in the reconquest of South Carolina from the British. Kate Barry was an ancestor of the actress Amanda Blake (1929-1989), remembered for the role of the red-haired saloon proprietress \\"Miss Kitty Russell\\" on the television western Gunsmoke. Blake placed a cameo- sized portrait of Barry owned by her family in the Spartanburg, South Carolina local history museum, where it remains on display to this day.

The opponent is forced to the ground with a twist of the body. A scissor kick in martial arts is any of certain kicking or grabbing techniques that resemble a pair of scissors. In the Asian martial arts It may describe a mid-air kick in which both legs are swung or kicked out in different directions to strike two opponents simultaneously or in rapid succession. This is particularly common in some schools of Taekwondo, Vovinam, and some Chinese martial arts, also in Silat and Pencak Silat where it is referred to as Gunting (in Malay language). In sanshou, the scissor kick is used as a mid air take down where one leg presses on the opponent's chest while the other leg positioned behind the opponent's knees, and is delivered with enough symmetrical force to knock the opponent down; the scissor leg take down is one of the more advanced take downs in san shou and is an effective tool used in many matches. In Judo, Kani basami, also known as Kane sute in Danzan-ry≈´, is classified as a sacrifice throw, known as \\"scissors throw.\\" It is less of a strike however and tends to be more similar to a foot sweep. In wrestling This move is also well known in the professional wrestling world among many wrestlers and fans. The attacker jumps (from a standing or running position) using one leg for momentum and drives the other leg into the back of the head and the neck of the opponent. Throughout his career, Booker T, a former wrestler in WWE, WCW, and TNA, is credited to having popularizing the move in the United States. Various other wrestlers who uses this technique, such as former WWE wrestler Bull Buchanan and former TNA wrestler and current WWE wrestler Ron Killings, currently known as R-Truth, uses this as a regular move but performs a corkscrew variation of the move.

Origins He was the eldest surviving son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland (d.1283), by his wife of unknown identity. The date of his birth is not known and some sources have placed it, on no good evidence, as early as 1243. This is now thought to be unlikely, for the following reasons. Firstly, James's father is known to have planned a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint James of Compostella in 1252 or after, so that James would probably have been born after this, and named in honour of that saint. Secondly, James's Christian name was an unusual one, then uncommon in Scotland and not a traditional name in the Stewart family where Walter and Alan were favoured. It is therefore quite possible that he was not Alexander's eldest son, but rather the eldest surviving son. For these reasons, and also the fact of his son and successor Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland being described in about 1314 as a \\"beardless lad\\" by John Barbour in his poem The Brus, it is proposed that James was born in about 1260.. Career In 1286 James was chosen as one of the six Guardians of Scotland. He subsequently submitted to King Edward I of England on 9 July 1297 and was one of the auditors for the competitor, Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale. However, during the Wars of Scottish Independence he joined Sir William Wallace. After Wallace's defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, he gave his support to Robert Bruce, later King Robert I of Scotland, grandson of the competitor. In 1302, with six other ambassadors including John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, he was sent to solicit the aid of the French king against King Edward, to whom he was once again compelled to swear fealty at Lanercost Priory on 23 October 1306. To render his oath inviolable, it was taken upon the two crosses of Scotland most esteemed for their sanctity, on the consecrated host, the holy gospels and on various relics of saints and he agreed to submit to instant excommunication if he should break his allegiance to Edward. However, convinced that his faith was primarily to his country in spite of all, he once again took up the Scottish patriotic cause and died in the service of Robert the Bruce in 1309.Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.ix, p.513.

The intellectual property from the work can be licensed to other parties or partners for further derivative works and commercial exploitation across a range of media and by a variety of industries for merchandising purposes.  Transmedia franchise A media franchise often consists of cross-marketing across more than one medium. For the owners, the goal of increasing profit through diversity can extend the commercial profitability of the franchise and create strong feelings of identity and ownership in its consumers (fandom). Aarseth describes the financial logic of cost-recovery for expensive productions by identifying that a single medium launch is a lost opportunity, the timeliness of the production and release is more important than its integrity, the releases should raise brand awareness and the cross-ability of the work is critical for its success. American Idol was a transmedia franchise from its beginnings, with the first season winner Kelly Clarkson signing with RCA Records and having the release of A Moment Like This becoming a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100. The success resulted in a nationwide concert tour, an American Idol book that made the bestseller list and the film From Justin to Kelly. A transmedia franchise however is often referred to by the simpler term \\"media franchise.\\" The term media franchise is often used to describe the popular adaptation of a work into films, like the popular Twilight book series that was adapted into the five films of The Twilight Saga. Other neologisms exist to describe various franchise types including metaseries, which can be used to describe works such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.Palumbo, Donald. \\"Asimov's Crusade Against Bigotry: The Persistence Of Prejudice as a Fractal Motif in the Robot/Empire Foundation Metaseries.\\" JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS 10 (1998): 43-63. Multimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one medium, and then expanding to others through licensing agreements, with respect to intellectual property in the franchise's characters and settings. As one author explains, \\"[f]or the studios, a home- run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products.\\"Barry Langford, Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945, p. 207, . The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously: Development to other forms=Fiction Long-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long- term contract. Examples include Andy Hardy, Ma and Pa Kettle, Bulldog Drummond, Superman, Tarzan, and Batman. The longest-running modern film franchises include James Bond, Godzilla and King Kong, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Star Trek. In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed. Media franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as Nancy Drew, Miss Marple, and other popular detectives, as well as popular comic book superheroes. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in novels, particularly those in the fantasy and science fiction genres, such as The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, Doctor Who and Star Wars. Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into animated television series, video games, or both. A media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like Square Enix's Final Fantasy or the National Lampoon series, and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated. Non-fiction Non-fiction literary franchises include the ...For Dummies and The Complete Idiot's Guide to... reference books. An enduring and comprehensive example of a media franchise is Playboy Enterprises, which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, Playboy, within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (Playboy's Penthouse, in 1959), and even its own television channel. Twenty-five years later, Playboy released private clubs and restaurants, movie theaters, a radio show, direct to video films, music and book publishing (including original works in addition to its anthologies of cartoons, photographs, recipes, advice, articles or fiction that had originally appeared in the magazine), footwear, clothing of every kind, jewelry, housewares (lamps, clocks, bedding, glassware), guitars and gambling, playing cards, pinball machines and pet accessories, billiard balls, bedroom appurtenances, enhancements, plus countless other items of merchandise.

Summary This player is focusing on adjusting the levels of production at his JVD (JVC) corporate headquarters. The traditional definition of a leading company is a corporation that currently dominates the \\"corporate wars\\" against their competitors. Its employees are considered by most people to be winning the \\"rat race.\\" Both versions of this game were released to an exclusively Japanese market. However, the NEC PC-9801 version has sharper graphics and the ability to use a mouse. Instead of abstract colors (to depict control of each square of the board), buildings are used to depict a typical Japanese residential neighborhood. A theme park is shown on an island in the PC-9801 version to depict recreational opportunities while the interior of the corporate headquarters is seen in the Sharp X68000 version. The game challenges young people to create their own business empire by researching and marketing better VHS machines for the Japanese consumers. In both version of the game, the player is introduced to jazzy instrumental song being played in the background while neon pictures of various people fly across the screen. As of 2011, there has been no attempt to produce an English language version for this game either through official channels or through unofficial emulator translator groups. This game is considered to be in Japanese for the full duration of the game, making literacy skills in Japanese mandatory. Only the brand names themselves use ASCII letters; all other words use the Japanese alphabet. There are only two time periods in the game and jazz music plays throughout the entire game. The player can either start in the 1970s when VCRs were beginning to be researched in Japan or in the 1980s when VHS (and video cassette recorders) were beginning to come of age. Up to eight buildings can be constructed on the corporation's property to build and research new technology. However, three buildings are already established at the start of the game. Each product that he or she manufactures has a separate profit chart. When an older model goes down in profits, research and manufacture a newer one (don't forget to discontinue the older one first) and make more money from willing Japanese customers. It is considered to be the job of the player to try to keep his chosen corporation profitable by creating new VHS machines while making sure that people still spend money on the ones being made. If they go down to zero or less, then his or her company goes bankrupt. At this point, he or she loses the game. When a company goes bankrupt, a television news screen appears with the English word \\"DISSOLVED\\" right on the picture caption.

The siege was a part of Pontiac's War, an effort by Native Americans to remove the British from the Ohio Country and Allegheny Plateau after they refused to honor their promises and treaties to leave voluntarily after the defeat of the French. The Native American efforts of diplomacy, and by siege, to remove the British from Fort Pitt ultimately failed. This event is best known as an early instance of biological warfare, where the British gave items from a smallpox infirmary as gifts to Native American emissaries with the hope of spreading the deadly disease to nearby tribes. The effectiveness is unknown, although it is known that the method used is inefficient compared to respiratory transmission and these attempts to spread the disease are difficult to differentiate from epidemics occurring from previous contacts with colonists. Background Fort Pitt was built in 1758 during the French and Indian War, on the site of what was previously Fort Duquesne in what is now the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The French abandoned and destroyed Fort Duquesne in November 1758 with the approach of General John Forbes's expedition. The Forbes expedition was successful in part because of the Treaty of Easton, in which area American Indians agreed to end their alliance with the French. American Indians‚Äîprimarily the Six Nations, Delawares and Shawnees‚Äîmade this agreement with the understanding that the British would leave the area after their war with the French. The hostilities between the French and English declined significantly after 1760, followed by a final cessation of hostilities and the formal surrender of the French at the Treaty of Paris in February 1763. Instead of leaving the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains as they had agreed, the British remained on Native lands and reinforced their forts while settlers continued to push westward. The attacks led by Pontiac against the British in early May 1763, near Fort Detroit, mark what is generally considered to be the beginning of Pontiac's War. The siege of Fort Pitt and numerous other British forts during the spring and summer of 1763 were part of an effort by American Indians to reclaim their territory by driving the British out of the Ohio Country and back across the Appalachian Mountains. While many of the forts and outposts in the region were destroyed, the Indian effort to remove the British from Fort Pitt ultimately failed. Diplomacy and siege By May 27, the uprising reached the tribes near Fort Pitt, and there were many signs of impending hostilities. The captain of the Fort Pitt militia learned that the Delaware tribe just north of the fort had abandoned their dwellings and cornfields overnight. The Mingo had also abandoned their villages further up the river. The proprietor of the Pennsylvania provincial store reported that numerous Delaware warriors had arrived \\"in fear and haste\\" to exchange their skins for gunpowder and lead. The western Delaware warrior leaders Wolf and Kickyuscung had fewer than 100 warriors, so did not immediately attack the well-fortified Fort Pitt. Instead, on May 29, they attacked the supporting farms, plantations and villages in the vicinity of the fort. Panicked settlers crowded into the already overcrowded fort. Captain Simeon Ecuyer tried to ready his fort after this news of expanding hostilities, putting his 230 men, half regulars and half quickly organized militia, on alert. The fort's exceptional structural defenses, made of stone with bastions covering all angles of attack, were supported by 16 cannons which he had permanently loaded. Ecuyer demolished the nearby village houses and structures to deny cover for attackers. He had trenches dug outside the fort, and set out beaver traps. Smallpox had been discovered within the fort, prompting Ecuyer to build a makeshift hospital in which to quarantine those infected. On the June 16, four Shawnee visited Fort Pitt and warned Alexander McKee and Captain Simeon Ecuyer that several Indian nations had accepted Pontiac's war belt and bloody hatchet and were going on the offensive against the British, but that the Delaware were still divided, with the older Delaware chiefs advising against war. The following day, however, the Shawnee returned and reported a more threatening situation, saying that all the nations \\"had taken up the hatchet\\" against the British, and were going to attack Fort Pitt. Even the local Shawnee themselves \\"were afraid to refuse\\" to join the uprising, a subtle hint that the occupants of Fort Pitt should leave. Ecuyer dismissed the warnings and ignored the requests to leave. On June 22, Fort Pitt was attacked on three sides by Shawnee, western Delaware, Mingo and Seneca, which prompted return fire from Ecuyer's artillery. This initial attack on the fort was repelled. Since the Indians were unfamiliar with siege warfare, they opted to try diplomacy yet again. On June 24, Turtleheart spoke with McKee and Trent outside the fort, informing them that all of the other forts had fallen, and that Fort Pitt \\"is the only one you have left in our country.\\" He warned McKee that \\"six different nations of Indians\\" were ready to attack if the garrison at the fort did not retreat immediately. They thanked Turtleheart and assured him that Fort Pitt could withstand \\"all nations of Indians\\", and they presented the Indian dignitaries with two small blankets and a handkerchief from the smallpox hospital. For the next several days it remained relatively quiet, although reports were coming in about fort after fort falling before large bands of attacking warriors. Thomas Hutchins Map of Henry Bouquet's 1764 Expedition July 3, four Ottawa newcomers requested a parley and tried to trick the occupants of Fort Pitt into surrender, but the ruse failed. This was followed by several weeks of relative quiet, through July 18 when a large group of warriors arrived, likely from the Fort Ligonier area. McKee was informed by the Shawnee that the Indians were still hopeful of an amicable outcome, similar to agreements just made at Detroit. On July 26, a large conference headed by Ecuyer was convened with several leaders of the Ohioan tribes outside the walls of Fort Pitt. The Indian delegation, Shingess, Wingenum and Grey Eyes among them, came to the fort under a flag of truce to parley, and again requested that the British leave this place. They explained that by taking the Indian's country the British caused this war, and Tessecumme of the Delaware noted that the British were the cause of the trouble since they had broken their promises and treaties. They had come onto Indian land and built forts, despite being asked not to, so now the tribes in the area have amassed to take back their lands. He informed Ecuyer that there was still a short time remaining to leave peacefully. The Delaware and Shawnee chiefs made sure Captain Ecuyer at Fort Pitt understood the cause of the conflict. Turtleheart told him, \\"You marched your armies into our country, and built forts here, though we told you, again and again, that we wished you to move, this land is ours, and not yours.\\" The Delaware also let it be known, \\"that all the country was theirs; that they had been cheated out of it, and that they would carry on the war till they burnt Philadelphia\\". The British refused to leave, claiming that this was their home now. They bluffed that they could hold out for three years, and bragged that several large armies were coming to their aid. This \\"very much enraged\\" the Indian delegation, Trent wrote, \\"White Eyes and Wingenum seemed to be very much irritated and would not shake hands with our people at parting.\\" On July 28, the siege began in earnest and continued for several days. Seven of the fort garrison were wounded, at least one mortally; Ecuyer was wounded in the leg by an arrow. For Commander-in-Chief, North America Jeffery Amherst, who before the war had dismissed the possibility that the Indians would offer any effective resistance to British rule, the military situation over the summer had become increasingly grim. The frustration was so great, he wrote to Colonel Henry Bouquet and instructed him not to take any Indian prisoners. He proposed that they should be intentionally exposed to smallpox, hunted down with dogs, and \\"Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race.\\" Amherst had directed Bouquet to take his troops to relieve Fort Pitt, a march that would take several weeks. At Fort Pitt, the siege didn't let up until August 1, 1763, when most of the Indians broke off their attack in order to intercept the body of almost 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at Edge Hill in the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet survived the attack and the Indians were unable to prevent his command from relieving Fort Pitt on August 10. Aftermath More than 500 British troops and perhaps a couple thousand settlers had died in the Ohio Valley, and of more than a dozen British forts, only Detroit, Niagara and Pitt remained standing at the height of this uprising. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade all settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains‚Äîa proclamation ignored by British settlers, and unenforced by the British military. Fort Pitt would remain in British hands, and would become a central hub for migrant settlers as they pushed west in ever larger numbers over the next decade. Biological warfare=Handoff of infirmary items Sometime in the spring of 1763, a smallpox epidemic broke out near Fort Pitt and subsequently spread there. A smallpox hospital was then also established there to treat sick troops. There had also been an earlier epidemic among Ohio tribes in the early 1750s, as smallpox outbreaks occurred every dozen or so years. According to John McCullough, who was held captive, some of the Mahoning village warriors raiding a Juniata settlement caught smallpox from there that then killed some of them. In 1924 the Mississippi Valley Historical Review published a journal written by William Trent, a fur trader and merchant commissioned as a captain at Fort Pitt. For June 24, 1763, Trent wrote about a meeting with two Delaware Indians at the fort. \\"Out of our regard to them we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect.\\" The two blankets and the handkerchief from the infirmary were seemingly wrapped in a piece of linen. The blankets and handkerchief were unwashed and dirty. In 1955 a record of Trent's trading firm was found. It had an invoice for the handkerchief, two blankets and the linen to be given to the Natives, and the expense was signed by Ecuyer. Ecuyer was relatively inexperienced, having only been a captain since April the year before and having taken over the command of the fort the same November. Trent was likely the main orchestrator of the idea, considering he had more experience with the disease and had even helped out setting the smallpox hospital. Half-Native Alexander McKee also played a part in parlaying messages, but he possibly didn't know about the items. This plan was carried out independently from General Amherst and Colonel Bouquet. The meeting happened on June 24. The night before \\"Two Delawares called for Mr. McKee and told him they wanted to speak to him in the Morning.\\" The conference took place just outside of Fort Pitt. The participants were Ecuyer, McKee, Turtle's Heart, and another Delaware, \\"Mamaltee a Chief.\\" The two Delaware men tried to coax the people holed up in the fort to leave, an option that Ecuyer promptly rejected and stated that reinforcements were coming to Fort Pitt and that the stronghold could easily hold out. After conferring with their chiefs, the two \\"returned and said they would hold fast of the Chain of friendship\\", but they were not genuinely believable. The messengers had asked for presents such as food and alcohol, \\"to carry us Home.\\" Requesting gifts was common, but Ecuyer in this case seemed especially generous. Turtle's Heart and his companion received food in \\"large quantities\\", some \\"600 Rations.\\" Included among this was the linen bundle containing the handkerchief and two blankets. A month after meeting on July 22, Trent met with the same delegates again and they seemingly had not contracted smallpox: \\"Gray Eyes, Wingenum, Turtle's Heart and Mamaultee, came over the River told us their Chiefs were in Council, that they waited for Custaluga who they expected that Day.\\" Gershom Hicks, who was fluent in the Delaware language and also knew some Shawnee, testified that starting from spring 1763 up to April 1764 around a hundred Natives from different tribes such as Lenni Lenape (Delaware) and Shawnee died in the smallpox epidemic, making it a relatively minor smallpox outbreak. After visiting Pittsburgh a few years later, David McClure would write in his journal published in 1899, \\"I was informed at Pittsburgh, that when the Delawares, Shawanese & others, laid siege suddenly and most traitorously to Fort Pitt, in 1764, in a time of peace, the people within, found means of conveying the small pox to them, which was far more destructive than the guns from the walls, or all the artillery of Colonel Boquet's army, which obliged them to abandon the enterprise.\\" Amherst letters A month later in July Colonet Bouquet discussed Pontiac's War in detail with General Amherst via letters, and in postscripts of three letters in more freeform style Amherst also briefly broached the subject of using of smallpox as a weapon. Bouquet brought up blankets as a means without going into specifics, and Amherst supported the idea \\"to Extirpate this Execreble Race\\". Bouquet himself probably never had the opportunity to \\"Send the Small Pox.\\" He was very concerned about smallpox, having never had it. When Bouquet wrote to Ecuyer, he didn‚Äôt mention the disease. He died only two years later in 1765 of yellow fever. Later assessments This event is usually described as an early attempt at biological warfare.http://metro.co.uk/2013/04/08/could-smallpox- really-be-turned-into-a-biological-weapon-by- terrorists-3585028/http://www.kliinikum.ee/infektsioonikontrolliteenistus/doc/oppematerjalid/Referaadid/Rouged.pdf However the plan‚Äôs effectiveness is generally questioned. =Early research= The account of the British infecting Natives with smallpox during Pontiac's War of 1763 originated with nineteenth century historian Francis Parkman. His account has been relied on by later writers. He described Amherst‚Äôs reply to Bouquet as a ‚Äúdetestable suggestion‚Äù and concluded \\"There is no direct evidence that Bouquet carried into effect the shameful plan of infecting the Indians though, a few months after, the small-pox was known to have made havoc among the tribes of the Ohio.\\" Parkman had the impression that Amherst had planned the gifting, although Amherst approached the matter only a month later. Following Parkman was Howard Peckham who was more interested in the overall war and paid only cursory glance to the incident, briefly describing Ecuyer handing over the handkerchief and blankets from the smallpox hospital. He quoted a testimony of a smallpox outbreak and stated that it certainly affected the Natives' ability to wage war. Bernhard Knollenberg was more critical and pointed out that both Parkman and Peckham hadn't noticed that the smallpox epidemic among the tribes had been reported to have begun in the spring of 1763, quite some time before the meeting. Knollenberg even doubted the authenticity of the documents at first before he was contacted via letter by historian Donald H. Kent who had found a record of Trent's sundries list signed by Ecuyer. =Later researchers= Francis Jennings, a historian who extensively studied Parkman's writings, had a more damning view. He indicated that the fighting strength of the Natives was greatly compromised by the plan. Microbiologist Mark Wheelis says the act of biological aggression at Fort Pitt is indisputable, but that at the time the rare attempts to transmit infection rarely worked and they were probably made redundant with natural routes of transmission. The practice was restrained by lack of knowledge. Elizabeth A. Fenn writes that \\"the actual effectiveness of an attempt to spread smallpox remains impossible to ascertain: the possibility always exists that infection occurred by some natural route.\\" Philip Ranlet describes as a clear sign that the blankets had no effect the fact that the same delegates were met a month later, and that nearly all of the met natives were recorded to have lived for decades afterwards. He also questions why Trent didn't gloat about any possible success in his journal if there was such. David Dixon holds likely that the transmission happened via some other route and possibly from the event described by John McCullough. Barbara Mann holds that the distribution worked, describing that Gershom Hick's testimony of the epidemic starting by spring is explainable by Hicks lacking a calendar. Mann also estimates that papers related to the incident have been destroyed. Researchers James W. Martin, George W. Christopher and Edward M. Eitzen writing in a publication for the US Army Medical Department Center & School, Borden Institute, found that \\"In retrospect, it is difficult to evaluate the tactical success of Captain Ecuyer's biological attack because smallpox may have been transmitted after other contacts with colonists, as had previously happened in New England and the South. Although scabs from smallpox patients are thought to be of low infectivity as a result of binding of the virus in fibrin metric, and transmission by fomites has been considered inefficient compared with respiratory droplet transmission.\\" In an article published in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection researchers Vincent Barras and Gilbert Greub conclude that ‚Äúin the light of contemporary knowledge, it remains doubtful whether his hopes were fulfilled, given the fact that the transmission of smallpox through this kind of vector is much less efficient than respiratory transmission, and that Native Americans had been in contact with smallpox >200 years before Ecuyer‚Äôs trickery, notably during Pizarro‚Äôs conquest of South America in the 16th century. As a whole, the analysis of the various ‚Äòpre-microbiological‚Äù attempts at BW illustrate the difficulty of differentiating attempted biological attack from naturally occurring epidemics.‚Äù CitationsReferences        * * External links * NativeWeb documents on: Amherst-Bouquet - Fort Pitt - Fenn on smallpox in the Americas * Bouquet Papers * Global Biosecurity: Threats and Responses; Katona, Peter; Routledge * Ecuyer, Simeon: Fort Pitt and letters from the frontier (1892): Entry June 2, 1763 - Entry of June 24, 1763 * \\"Colonial Germ Warfare\\", article from Colonial Williamsburg Journal * John McCullough Narrative * History of that part of the Susquehanna and Juniata valleys, embraced in the counties of Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Union and Snyder, in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Everts, Peck & Richards; 1886 * Pioneers of Second Fork James P.

PLS belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases. Motor neuron diseases develop when the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement degenerate and die, causing weakness in the muscles they control. PLS only affects upper motor neurons. There is no evidence of the degeneration of spinal motor neurons or muscle wasting (amyotrophy) that occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Symptoms Onset of PLS usually occurs spontaneously after age 50 and progresses gradually over a number of years, or even decades. The disorder usually begins in the legs, but it may start in the tongue or the hands. Symptoms may include difficulty with balance, weakness and stiffness in the legs, and clumsiness. Other common symptoms are spasticity (involuntary muscle contraction due to the stretching of muscle, which depends on the velocity of the stretch) in the hands, feet, or legs, foot dragging, and speech and swallowing problems due to involvement of the facial muscles. Breathing may also become compromised in the later stages of the disease, causing those patients who develop ventilatory failure to require noninvasive ventilatory support. Hyperreflexia is another key feature of PLS as seen in patients presenting with the Babinski's sign. Some people present with emotional lability and bladder urgency, and occasionally people with PLS experience mild cognitive changes detectable on neuropsychological testing, particularly on measures of executive function. PLS is not considered hereditary when onset is in adulthood; however, juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) has been linked to a mutation in the ALS2 gene which encodes the cell-signalling protein alsin. The issue of whether PLS exists as a different entity from ALS is not clear, as some patients initially diagnosed as having PLS ultimately develop lower motor neuron signs. Spasticity Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) usually presents with gradual-onset, progressive, lower-extremity stiffness and pain due to muscle spasticity. Onset is often asymmetrical. Although the muscles do not appear to atrophy as in ALS (at least initially), the disabling aspect of PLS is muscle spasticity and cramping, and intense pain when those muscles are stretched, resulting in joint immobility. A normal walking stride may become a tiny step shuffle with related instability and falling. Cause Researchers do not fully understand what causes PLS, although it is thought it could be due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors.http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases- conditions/primary-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/dxc-20214456 Studies are being done to evaluate the possible causes, although linking causality can be difficult due to the relatively low number of people who are diagnosed with PLS. Juvenile PLS may be caused by the ALS2 gene, although this condition is very rare. Diagnosis There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of PLS. Therefore, the diagnosis occurs as the result of eliminating other possible causes of the symptoms and by an extended observation period. Like ALS, diagnosing PLS is a diagnosis of exclusion, as there is no one test that can confirm a diagnosis of PLS. The Pringle Criteria, proposed by Pringle et al, provides a guideline of nine points that, if confirmed, can suggest a diagnosis of PLS. Due to the fact that a person with ALS may initially present with only upper motor neuron symptoms, indicative of PLS, one key aspect of the Pringle Criteria is requiring a minimum of three years between symptom onset and symptom diagnosis. When these criteria are met, a diagnosis of PLS is highly likely. Other aspects of Pringle Criteria include normal EMG findings, thereby ruling out lower motor neuron involvement that is indicative of ALS, and absence of family history for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and ALS. Imaging studies to rule out structural or demyelinating lesions may be done as well. Hoffman's sign and Babinski reflex may be present and indicative of upper motor neuron damage. Treatment Treatment for individuals with PLS is symptomatic. Baclofen and tizanidine may reduce spasticity. Quinine or phenytoin may decrease cramps. Some patients who do not receive adequate relief from oral treatment may consider intrathecal baclofen (i.e., infusion of medication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid via a surgically placed continuous infusion pump). However, patients are carefully selected for this type of procedure to ensure that they will likely benefit from this invasive procedure. Physical therapy often helps prevent joint immobility. Speech therapy may be useful for those with involvement of the facial muscles. Physiotherapy treatment focuses on reducing muscle tone, maintaining or improving range of motion, increasing strength and coordination, and improving functional mobility. In PLS, stretching is thought to improve flexibility and can also reduce muscle spasticity and cramps. Patients with PLS may find it beneficial to have an evaluation, as well as follow-up visits at multidisciplinary clinics, similar to those available for people with ALS. These multidisciplinary clinics may provide patients with the necessary treatment that they require by having an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech language pathologist, dietician and nutritionist, all in one site. Prognosis Patients can often live with PLS for many years and very often outlive their neurological disease and succumb to some unrelated condition. There is currently no effective cure, and the progression of symptoms varies. Some people may retain the ability to walk without assistance, but others eventually require wheelchairs, canes, or other assistive devices.

The winery achieved international recognition when its wine won first place in the Ottawa Wine Tasting of 1981. Description Visitors to the winery take a short cable car ride from the main entrance to the villa and distillery which sits upon a hill looking over the Napa Valley. Sterling Vineyards farms of vines in various parts of Napa Valley. Production emphasizes Bordeaux and Burgundy-style wines, and is split in several tiers: the entry-level \\"Napa Valley\\" wines for which it is most famous, \\"Reserve\\" wines (their highest level), \\"Single Vineyard\\" wines (specialty wines for enthusiasts), \\"Vintner's Collection\\" (value wines for restaurants and mass distribution), and \\"Cellar Club\\" (limited production and eclectic wines for their wine club members). Gondola lift at the winery Sterling Vineyards is a popular destination for tourists, in part for a gondola lift that shuttles visitors from a parking lot to the winery, which sits on a volcanic hill above the valley floor. The building is designed to appear like the white villages of the Greek island Mykonos, and incorporates bells from St. Dunstans's in London, England, a church destroyed in World War II. History Last serving station on the wine tasting tour English expatriate Peter Newton founded the company in 1964, with the first year of production in 1969. He planted Merlot and Chardonnay, now very common in Napa Valley, at a time most vineyards were focusing on Cabernet Sauvignon. Under long-time winemaker Ric Forman (later of Abreu Vineyards), they released California's first vintage-dated Merlot. The Coca-Cola Company bought the winery in 1977, in a short-lived attempt to enter the wine market. Seagram bought the winery in 1982, and was in turn purchased by Diageo in 2001. Treasury Wine Estates bought most of Diageo's US wines in 2016.

Music career Discovered by Michael English and Mark Lowry with Bill Gaither at the 1987 National Quartet Convention mid day booth cleanup. The kids, then ages 15, 16 and 17 were singing accapella in an empty Civic Center after being rejected by a local record company who told them to go back home and forget about trying to make it in \\"the business.\\" Following a weekend visit to their home town by Mr. Howard, they signed with Mark Five Records who launched their first album release in 1990, \\"With Love From Arkansas\\", produced by Eddie Howard, which quickly ran up the gospel charts. In 1990 A second album release sealed their position in Gospel Music and the contract was sold to Springhill Records that would take them to an all new level of marketing. Originally from Hamburg, Arkansas, near the Louisiana border in Ashley County,Douglas Harrison, \\"'From Arkansas With Love': Evangelical Crisis Management and (White) Southern Gospel Music,\\" Southern Spaces, 29 April 2014. http://southernspaces.org/2014/arkansas-love-evangelical-crisis-management- and-southern-white-gospel-music the vocalists grew up firmly and proudly planted in the Southern gospel tradition, so it is not surprising that, as they have matured, a broad range of influences have entered their musical mix. Billboard magazine describes The Martins as \\"breaking down walls and blurring the lines that separate Southern gospel from inspirational, adult contemporary, and other popular Christian music formats.\\" Rather than resting in a single niche among the numerous Christian music genres, the Martins have rummaged freely through a stack of style books, grabbing whatever interests them. Sometimes the different elements are unaltered and traditional, but more often they are tossed into the trio's musical blender so that a new mixture emerges. The result has been labeled simply as Martin Music. Their portfolio of songs includes every musical palate, ranging from innovative and refashioned hymn arrangements to contemporary songs of praise and worship. While their eclectic style draws from a variety of musical genres, the Martins are often framed and presented as a cultural phenomenon rooted in the rural United States South, specifically in Arkansas. The Martins‚Äô \\"big break\\" came in 1992 when Michael English and Mark Lowry insisted that Gloria Gaither listen to the group audition in the women's restroom prior to a Gaither Homecoming video recording in Indiana. Gloria told Bill that he had to let them sing in the video. They have gone on to appear in over two dozen Homecoming videos. The group has also recorded over a dozen albums. In 2002, Jonathan left the group in order to spend more time with his family. Joyce and Judy then enlisted the help of Paul Lancaster, formerly with Mullins & Co., and The Nelons. Together they recorded Above It All. Between 2003 and 2010, they were somewhat inactive as a group in order to spend more time with their own families, although they did reunite for concerts periodically. During this time, the three each recorded a solo album. They often appear on the Gaither Homecoming concert tours, as well as in limited trio appearances. Personal lives Joyce Martin Sanders (b. January 6, 1968) lives in Nashville, Tennessee with her husband Paul, and she has two children. Jonathan Martin (b. May 19, 1970) lives in Clive, Iowa with his wife Dara Makohoniuk-Martin and their youngest three of six children, including twin boys, one of which has cerebral palsy. Judy Martin Hess (b. May 3, 1971) lives in Columbus, Georgia with her husband Jake Hess Jr. and their four children.

He is credited as writer, director, producer, Film editor and cinematographer of much of his own work. He directed the B-movie film Hobgoblins, which was featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Early life  Rick attended Hollywood High School in Hollywood, California. At the age of 18, Sloane was inspired by the ultra-low-budget film Hollywood Boulevard. This film was also the directorial debut for Gremlins director Joe Dante, another of Sloane's inspirations. Mary Woronov, one of the stars of \\"Hollywood Boulevard,\\" agreed to take the lead in Sloane's first feature, Blood Theater, made when he was 21 years old. Sloane also produced fake trailers for non- existent Grindhouse style films such as Chainsaw Chicks, Amputee Hookers, Nightmare of the Lost Whores and Clown Whores of Hollywood. Sloane was working with 20th Century Fox to promote The Rocky Horror Picture Show and these short films were first shown at The \\"Third Annual Transylvanian Convention\\" held in Anaheim, California. It was also the launching of the Rocky Horror sequel \\"Shock Treatment\\". Sloane himself organized and produced one of the earliest of these cult conventions in 1981. The event was videotaped and aired on syndicated television that same summer as part of the syndicated special \\"Rocky Horror Treatment\\" and later that fall in a segment on NBC, in one of televisions original reality shows, \\"Real People\\". Career His lesser-known but bigger-budget films include Marked for Murder and Good Girls Don't. Sloane fulfills many of the roles in his filmmaking; he is a writer, director, producer, editor and cinematographer. Rick retains creative control over his films by self-producing them. He has never directed a film that he didn't write the script himself. By 25 years old, he directed his first three feature films, Blood Theatre, The Visitants and Hobgoblins. On August 13, 2014, Rick appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast. Hobgoblins Sloane's third feature Hobgoblins is in the genre of such films as Gremlins and Critters, albeit on a far lesser budget. The plot consists of a young security guard who must track down diminutive creatures who kill people while making their fantasies come true. Hobgoblins also received attention when it was later shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000. The episode, as usual, made unrelenting fun of the movie and of Sloane in particular, with Tom Servo attempting to use time travel to assault Sloane for making the film‚Äîonly to give Sloane inspiration for making the movie‚Äîat the episode's conclusion. MST3K writer Paul Chaplin later commented on Hobgoblins, saying, \\"It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we've ever done.\\"Episode 907- Hobgoblins Critics lambasted the film, with efilmcritic.com calling it \\"Jim Henson's worst nightmare.\\".Movie Review ‚Äì Hobgoblins ‚Äì eFilmCritic A sequel, Hobgoblins 2 has been released by Shout Factory in June 2009, wherein the same puppets and costumes are reused from the first film, and the cast is composed of new actors who resemble the original cast. The original Hobgoblins is simultaneously being re-released on DVD in widescreen, including director's commentary, and a new documentary, \\"Hobgoblins: The Making of A DisasterPiece.\\" The documentary includes interviews with original cast members Tom Bartlett (Kevin), Kelley Palmer (Daphne), Steven Boggs (Kyle), Billy Frank (Nick), Tami Clatterbuck (Fantazia), Darran Norris (Club Scum M.C.), Kenneth J. Hall (puppet fabricator), and Rick Sloane (writer and director). Vice Academy The 6-part Vice Academy series, which aired on the USA Network throughout the 1990s, was intended as a sexy spoof-on-a-spoof of the popular Police Academy movie series. Sloane replaced the usual mixed group of odd-ball characters with a sexy cast of females, including Ginger Lynn Allen, Linnea Quigley and Elizabeth Kaitan. The plot features female police cadets in training to join the Hollywood vice squad. Their assignments include infiltrating a child porn operation, and going undercover to join and break up a prostitution ring. As usual, critics were savage: Sandra Brennan of Allmovie said, \\"This tale wavers on the fine line between erotic comedy and soft-core porn with a definite leaning toward the latter.\\" However, Sloane contends that there is no actual sex and only ten seconds of nudity in the entire film. Critic Nathan Shumate commented, \\"Knowingly insipid to the point of being grotesque... It's a bad, bad, stupid movie, but somehow it fails to grossly offend, mainly because it doesn't try that hard.\\"http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/v/viceacademy.html  Reviews  Reviewers have been ruthless in their criticism of both Sloane and his films. J.P. Harris writes in his review of Hobgoblins: > \\"Aside from the no-talent acting, everything else in Hobgoblins can be > blamed on Rick Sloane, who wrote, produced, directed, edited and > photographed this weak comedy.\\"  Filmography  *Blood Theatre (1984) *The Visitants (1987) *Vice Academy (1988) *Hobgoblins (1988) *Marked for Murder (1989) *Vice Academy Part 2 (1990) *Vice Academy Part 3 (1991) *Mind, Body & Soul (1992) *Good Girls Don't (1993) *Vice Academy 4 (1994) *Vice Academy 5 (1996) *Babe Watch: Forbidden Parody (1996) *Vice Academy Part 6 (1998) *Hobgoblins 2 (2009) *Hobgoblins: The Making of A DisasterPiece (2009)  References External links * * Unofficial Rick Sloane website *Interview in Film Threat *Interview in Bad Movies *Interview in Agony Booth *Interview in Dread Central *Video Interview on Hobgoblins *Video Interview with Hobgoblins cast and director Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Film directors from Los Angeles ","title":"Rick Sloane"},{"id":"3593007","text":"or Motokochan in Wonder Kitchen is a 1993 Super Famicom point-and-click video game that features minigames related to cooking.

Although Lewiston briefly served as Idaho's capital from the formation of Idaho Territory in 1863, the territorial legislature moved it to Boise on December 24, 1864. Construction of the first portion of the capitol building began in the summer of 1905, fifteen years after statehood, and the architects were John E. Tourtellotte and Charles Hummel. Tourtellotte was a Connecticut native whose career began in Massachusetts and skyrocketed further when he moved to Boise. Hummel was a German immigrant who partnered with Tourtellotte in 1901\\\\. The final cost of the building was just over $2 million; it was completed in 1920. The architects used varied materials to construct the building and their design was inspired by Classical examples. Its sandstone exterior is from the state-owned quarry at nearby Table Rock. The building was included in the Boise Capitol Area District listing on the National Register of Historic Places on May 12, 1976. With Construction of the original building 1919 Chamber of the House of Representatives in 2018 Tourtellotte and Hummel used four types of marble: red marble from Georgia, gray marble from Alaska, green marble from Vermont, and black marble from Italy. Architectural inspirations included St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica in Rome, St Paul's Cathedral in London and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. The most prominent feature of the capitol is its dome. Surmounting this dome is a bronze eagle, tall. The capitol building is high, occupies an area of , and contains over of artistically carved marble. There are 219 pillars in the original building ‚Äì Doric, Corinthian, or Ionic ‚Äì and each pillar is made up of marble dust, plaster and scagliola. Scagliola is a mixture of granite, marble dust, gypsum and glue dyed to look like marble. This artificial marble was created by a family of artisans in Italy. On the first floor of the capitol building, when looking upward to the dome, 13 large stars and 43 smaller stars can be seen. The 13 large stars represent the thirteen original colonies and the 43 smaller stars indicate that Idaho was the forty-third state to enter the union. The floor contains a compass rose; in its center is a sundial that has minerals found in Idaho. The first floor also houses a statue called the Patriot by Kenneth Lonn, for those who worked in the mining industry. The second floor may be accessed via three entrances; from the east, south, and west. The lieutenant governor‚Äôs office is located in the west wing, just opposite the governor‚Äôs office. On the north side of the second floor rotunda is a sculpture of George Washington astride a horse; to its rear is the attorney general‚Äôs suite of offices, which formerly housed the supreme court, until its current building opened in 1970. The east wing houses the office of the secretary of state offices, in whose reception area is the official copy of the Great Seal of the State of Idaho. The third floor contains the Senate in the west wing and the House of Representatives in the east wing. The two chambers were remodeled in 1968. Also on this floor is the old Supreme Court room, now used for hearings and committee meetings of the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee. Balcony entrances on the fourth floor of the senate and house galleries, which enable the public to observe the legislature in session. The northeast, northwest, and southwest corners of this floor contain many historic paintings, as well as three murals by Dana Boussard. Restoration of the Capitol Renovated capitol dome In 1998, Idaho officials drafted a master plan to restore the Capitol. Though it has many impressive features, the \\"Statehouse\\" had begun to fade with age. The interior restoration work would include restoration and refinishing of windows, repairs to marble flooring and decorative plaster, restoration of wood floors, refinishing wood doors and restoring hardware, upgrading electrical, smoke and fire-detection systems, improving exterior lighting, adding an emergency power generator, and installation of an elevator accessible to disabled persons. The legislature initially provided a mere $120,000 for the project. In 2000, The master plan was completed and its total cost estimate put at $64 million. In 2001, the Legislature granted a one-time appropriation of $32 million; bonds were issued to cover the other half of the project. In 2002-03, crews completed Phase II of the project, which involved exterior repairs financed with a supplementary $1.5 million appropriation. In 2005, an increase in the state cigarette tax helped pay for interior restoration expenses totaling $20 million. In 2006, the legislature voted to finance two two-story underground legislative office wings at a cost about $130 million. However, in view of the U.S. economic downturn in 2008, Governor Butch Otter proposed single-story underground wings. After legislators agreed to this modification, construction began and continued until 2010, when both interior and exterior renovations were finished. Scagliola Plasterers were tasked with restoring scagliola, a composite of selenite, glue, and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. Making scagliola is a laborious 15-step process, which has to be restarted if a single mistake is made. During its construction, the Idaho state capitol‚Äôs architects used a combination of white marble and matching scagliola to create a \\"Capitol of Light,\\" so called because the materials would glow in natural light in the rotunda. =Capitol art= The Winged Victory statue is a plaster replica of the original marble statue of Nike of Samothrace. The original statue was found on the island of Samothrace, Greece, in 1863 by a French explorer. The statue has characteristic features of Hellenistic art. The people of France gave the replica to the United States as part of a gift after U.S. forces helped liberate France from Nazi occupation at the end of World War II. After it arrived in February 1949, state officials placed the gift in the Boise capitol. The sculpture Statue head of Louise Shadduck honors the dedication of Idaho author, historian, civil servant, and political activist Louise Shadduck who died in 2008, at age 92. In 1958, Shadduck was elected secretary of Commerce and Development ‚Äì the first woman to hold that office. The statue is made of bronze and black stone. The capitol also houses a display of 20 portraits of Idaho territorial and state Governors completed by artist Herbert A. Collins in 1911. Attractions Attractions in the restored and expanded building include a gilded equestrian statue of George Washington and information about the historic trees that surrounded the capitol building before the grounds were cleared for underground construction. (Presidents Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Taft planted trees on the property; Harrison planted a Water Oak, Roosevelt planted a Sugar Maple in 1903, and Taft planted the Ohio Buckeye in 1911.) The Golden Statue was carved by Charles Osner in 1869 from white pine, the state tree of Idaho. Osner worked by candlelight and took four years to finish the work. Details of the Capitol Visitors tour the restored Capitol in 2010. Tunnels connect the Capitol Building to the Supreme Court building and other government buildings on Capitol Mall to the east. Used daily by government employees, these tunnels are not accessible to the public, and could serve as bomb shelters to protect the governor and other public officials. A full-scale replica of the Liberty Bell (uncracked) occupies a site at the base of the stairs outside the Jefferson Street entrance. The bell is one of 53 commissioned in 1950 by the U.S. Treasury Department and presented to each of the states and is accessible to passersby who can ring it. The capitol faces southwest and looks down Capitol Boulevard, about a mile (1.6 km) in length. At its opposite end is the Boise Depot, built in 1925 on the rim of the first bench.

Habakuk Jephson's Statement\\" is an 1884 short story by young Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is in the form of a first-person testimony by a survivor of the Marie Celeste, a fictionalised version of the Mary Celeste, a ship found mysteriously abandoned and adrift in the Atlantic Ocean in 1872. Conan Doyle's story was published anonymously in the January 1884 issue of the respected Cornhill Magazine. Influence The story popularised the mystery of the Mary Celeste. Doyle drew heavily on the original incident, but some of the fictional elements that he introduced have come to replace the real events in the popular imagination. Doyle changes a number of details, including the names of the captain, crew, and passengers, and also the name of the vessel, from Mary Celeste to Marie Celeste.Macdonald Hastings, Mary Celeste, (1971) In the story, the ship is in an almost perfect state when discovered (the Mary Celeste had been in heavy weather and was waterlogged) and the boats are still present (the Mary Celeste one boat was actually missing). The fictional story reached a much wider audience than the original story of the Mary Celeste, which has led to the widespread belief that Marie Celeste was the name of the real ship. It is possible that the change to the ship's name was accidental, since Doyle does not change the name of the Dei Gratia, the ship that salvaged the Mary Celeste. Synopsis Jephson is an American citizen who is a qualified doctor and well-known, fervent opponent of slavery. He explains that he was wounded while fighting for the Union during the Civil War, and was nursed by an elderly black woman, who was aware of his abolitionist work. As a way of thanks, she gave him a small, carved, black stone which she said was a lucky charm that had been in her family for many generations and that would keep him from harm. Some eleven years later, Jephson develops a lung complaint and is advised to take a sea voyage. In Boston he books a passage to Lisbon on a ship called Marie Celeste. There are seven crew and three passengers: Jephson; an accountant named Harton; and a man of mixed race named Septimius Goring. The captain's wife and child are also aboard. The account then takes the form of Jephson's diary. As the ship prepares to depart, two experienced crew members fail to appear, and the captain has to recruit two black sailors who happen to be on the quay. Jephson notes that the ship's cook is black and that Goring has a black servant. Six days into the voyage, the captain's wife and baby disappear. The following day, the captain is found shot - suicide brought on by grief, Jephson supposes. There follows a series of unusual incidents, and Jephson and Harton become increasingly suspicious of Goring. Goring and the black sailors learn of Jephson's lucky charm, and take a great interest in it. Eventually, the ship approaches land. Jephson, Harton, and Hyson (the stand-in captain) expect it to be the coast of Portugal, but soon realise that it is Africa. Hyson believes his navigational instruments have been tampered with, and the three decide to continue the voyage to Portugal the following day. During the night Jephson is seized and tied up by Goring, Goring's servant, the cook, and the two black crewmen. He sees that Harton has been killed. After Goring sends signals to the shore, a large canoe manned by black Africans approaches the ship. They climb aboard and overpower the remaining crew members. There is then further discussion of the stone that Jephson is carrying, after which Goring tells Jephson that his life will be spared because the Africans believe the stone to have magical powers. While Jephson is taken ashore, the rest of the white crew are murdered and their bodies dumped into the sea. The ship - the Marie Celeste - is left to drift out to sea, where it is eventually discovered by the Dei Gratia. Jephson is taken to a temple where the lucky charm proves to be an ear from a giant stone idol. This causes the Africans to worship Jephson as the bearer of the missing ear, and he is treated with reverence, although it is clear that he remains a prisoner. During the night he is visited by Goring, who explains the history and significance of the statue and the stone ear. He also tells Jephson that he has a hatred of the white race, and, in revenge for the ill-treatment of himself and his family by white slave owners, he carried out a series of murders of white people in the United States. He explains that on the Marie Celeste he killed the captain and the captain's wife and child, and tampered with the navigation instruments so that Hyson would unwittingly steer for Africa. Now he finds he cannot bear the presence of white people and intends to become the head of the tribe of Africans, whom he considers to have a purity he cannot find anywhere else. The passengers and crew of the Marie Celeste were to be his last victims, but the stone ear complicated matters. Goring then announces that he has come to help Jephson escape. Jephson has become a rival for the tribe's devotion and stands in the way of Goring becoming the chief. Goring would like to kill Jephson, but that would antagonise the tribe. The safe alternative is to help Jephson escape and have the tribe believe that he has returned to heaven. The condition is that Jephson reveal Goring to be the black mass murderer who outwitted the white race for twenty years. Goring provides a boat in which Jephson is pushed out to sea by the two black crewmen from the Marie Celeste. After a few days Jephson is picked up by a passing steamer and returns to his home and family. Publication The story was first printed anonymously in Cornhill Magazine in January 1884 under the title \\"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement,\\" illustrated by William Small. It has been reprinted a number of times. The Boston Herald reprinted it on 3 April 1885,Boston Herald (3 April 1885) \\"Strange Tale of the Sea. Remarkable Voyage of the Brig Marie Celeste. A Missing Crew and What Became of Them.

Reception The story was first published anonymously, and one reviewer attributed it to Robert Louis Stevenson, while critics compared it to Edgar Allan Poe's work. Though fiction, it was presented as an eye-witness account of the end met by those on the mysterious \\"ghost ship\\". Some took the story as a true account, including the Boston Herald, which reprinted the tale, much to Doyle's astonishment.

The group is defined as Megalosaurus bucklandii and all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with it than with Allosaurus fragilis or Passer domesticus. Members of the group include Spinosaurus, Megalosaurus, and Torvosaurus. Classification The name Spinosauroidea is sometimes used in place of Megalosauroidea. The superfamily Spinosauroidea was named in 1915 by Ernst Stromer. It is a synonym of Megalosauroidea in almost all modern phylogenetic analyses, and it is therefore redundant. Spinosauroidea was defined as a clade in 1998 by Paul Sereno as the node clade containing the common ancestor of Spinosaurus and Torvosaurus and all its descendants. Thomas Holtz in 2004 defined a branch clade with the same name containing all species closer to Spinosaurus than to Passer domesticus. The ICZN holds that even clade names (which do not yet have any governing body) should be replaced if having a traditional taxon suffix and being synonyms of ranked taxa at or below the superfamily level. The seniority of Megalosauroidea was not followed in most paleontological literature during the 1990s and early 2000s. A series of papers supporting the validity of Megalosaurus as a genus, the relationships of megalosauroids, and the placement of \\"spinosauroids\\" among them, published between 2008 and 2010 argued that Megalosauroidea was in fact the valid name for the group. The classification of megalosauroids follows a study by Benson in 2010. Note that several \\"wildcard\\" taxa that are probably megalosauroids were excluded from the final tree, including Magnosaurus, Piveteausaurus and Streptospondylus. Later, Magnosaurus and Streptospondylus were added in the final tree. Supporting Information These are known from remains too fragmentary to be reliably classified. Some of these 'wildcard' taxa, such as Poekilopleuron and Megaraptor, have been considered possible megalosauroids in the past, but the analysis found that they are more likely allosauroids. Carrano, Benson & Sampson (2012) performed much larger phylogenetic analysis of the Tetanurae that includes more taxa. They used the clade name Megalosauria (Bonaparte, 1850) in their analysis and defined it as the node comprising Megalosaurus, Spinosaurus, their most recent common ancestor, and all its descendants. Furthermore, a new megalosauroid family Piatnitzkysauridae was named to include all megalosauroids more closely related to Piatnitzkysaurus than to either Spinosaurus or Megalosaurus. Within Megalosauridae a new subfamily was named, Afrovenatorinae, to include all megalosaurids more closely related to Afrovenator than to Megalosaurus. Unlike Benson et al., 2010, they recovered Poekilopleuron as an afrovenatorine, while Xuanhanosaurus was recovered as the basalmost metriacanthosaurid. However, the position of these taxa is very unstable, and their exclusion from the analysis gave more resolved and stable cladogram. Streptospondylus was also excluded to get more resolved Megalosauridae and Afrovenatorinae. The Chinese tetanuran Leshansaurus was included for the first time in a phylogenetic analysis, and was recovered as an afrovenatorine. Both Chuandongocoelurus and Monolophosaurus were found to be just outside Orionides. The cladogram presented here follows that study. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea.

Biography  Born in Sever do Vouga, Aveiro, Portugal, he emigrated to Canada in August 1968, where he gained popularity in the Portuguese community as a radio announcer on CHIN Radio. In 1973 he hosted a Portuguese language morning show called Ecos de Portugal and continued with Wake Up Portuguese Style in 1982. He was elected to the Toronto City Council in 1988 as Ward 4 councillor. A member of the New Democratic Party's Toronto caucus, he was re-elected in 1991 and 1994. Silva was the Ontario New Democratic Party's candidate in Parkdale in the 1995 provincial election but was defeated by incumbent Liberal MPP Tony Ruprecht. He wasn't re-elected in the 1997 municipal election, when he came third after Joe Pantalone and Mario Silva in a newly formed ward. There appeared to be some confusion amongst voters as he shared the same last name with Mario Silva. After the election he served as a union representative for the Hotel Employees, Restaurant Employees Union (HERE), Local 75 and then returned to CHIN Radio in late 2001. On February 1, 2006, Toronto City Council appointed Silva to fill the vacancy in Ward 20 that was created when Olivia Chow decided to run in the federal riding of Trinity-Spadina. Silva served as councillor until the 2006 municipal election in November 2006. A condition of the appointment was that he wasn't allowed to run as a candidate in that election.

Beginning as American distribution representative for Lumiere Brothers raw film stock in 1907, he joined producer Carl Laemmle in forming the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company in 1909, effectively weakening the stronghold of the Motion Picture Patents Company, headed by Thomas Edison, a large trust company that was then monopolizing the American film industry through contracts with hand- picked, established studios. By 1911 Brulatour was president of the Sales Company.New York Times, October 27, 1946; Moving Picture World, September 25, 1909, p. 411; Nickelodeon, December 15, 1910, p. 349 He was a founder of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, later known as Universal Pictures.  Career  Through the Sales Company, the growing number of independent filmmakers were able to obtain raw stock from Lumiere, for which Jules Brulatour remained sole US distributor, thereby cutting into profits for Kodak mogul George Eastman, whose film supply was exclusive to the Patents Company. Eastman soon realized he was on the losing side and approached Brulatour with a contract to sell his stock to the independents through the Sales Company. Brulatour accepted and his long association as head of distribution for Eastman Kodak began.Carl V. Ackerman, George Eastman (1930), p. 226. In addition to his position with Kodak and his presidency of the Sales Company, Jules Brulatour launched the Animated Weekly newsreel series and co-founded Peerless Pictures.Billboard, April 6, 1912, p. 15; Motography, December 5, 1914, p. 766. He was also an advisor and producer for the French-based Eclair Film Company, which opened in 1911 an extensive, state-of-the-art studio at Fort Lee, New Jersey, then the center of the burgeoning American movie industry. Eclair was a leader in technical and artistic advancements afoot in filmmaking at the time, and its American branch was hailed as a mecca for top talent, which Brulatour helped cultivate.Moving Picture World, October 7, 1911, p. 25; and November 11, 1911, p. 482; Moving Picture News, August 10, 1911, p. 17; Richard Koszarski, Fort Lee: The Film Town (2004), pp. 100, 116. In fact, its first leading lady, Dorothy Gibson, already well known as a model for leading illustrator Harrison Fisher, not only became a big star in Eclair vehicles but she landed the married Brulatour as a boyfriend.Randy Bryan Bigham, Finding Dorothy (2012), pp., 33-37. Dorothy Gibson, the second Mrs. Jules Brulatour His mistress proved herself a marketable screen personality, especially as a comedian in such popular one-reelers as Miss Masquerader (1911) and Love Finds a Way (1912). But her best-known role was that of herself in the drama Saved From the Titanic (1912), based on her real-life experiences as a survivor of the famous maritime disaster.Moving Picture News, May 4, 1912, p. 27. The movie, produced by Brulatour, was the first of many cinematic and theatrical productions about the sinking. It was released May 16, 1912, just over a month after the Titanic went down. Brulatour also produced the first newsreel about the Titanic disaster (Animated Weekly, issue No. 7, released April 22, 1912).Moving Picture News, May 4, 1912, p. 26. After the success of Saved From the Titanic, Dorothy Gibson retired from Eclair, choosing to study opera which Brulatour encouraged and financed. In 1913 her new career was interrupted when she was involved in a car accident in which a pedestrian was killed. The resulting lawsuit revealed that the car driven by Dorothy was owned by Jules Brulatour and that she was his lover.New York Times, May 22, 1913. Although he was already separated from his wife, Clara Isabelle Blouin Brulatour, the court scandal prompted her to initiate a divorce which was finalized in 1915.New York Times, April 23, 1915. With Clara he had three children, Claude, Yvonne, and Ruth. Meantime, Brulatour had teamed up again with Carl Laemmle to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, later known as Universal Pictures. This corporation, begun in 1912, drew together competing studios in an unprecedented amalgamation of talent and resources. Serving as Universal's first president, Brulatour was accused of conflict of interest by George Eastman, and although he denied the charge, he resigned.Moving Picture World, July 13, 1912, p. 129. Despite its unfortunate outcome for Brulatour personally, the consolidation of the leading independent filmmakers under the umbrella of Universal was a major turning point in the history of American motion pictures. The merger not only signaled the triumph of a free market in the industry but lead to the creation of the first major Hollywood studio ‚Äì‚Äì Universal City, constructed in 1914‚Äì1915 in Los Angeles in an effort by Laemmle to centralize operations. Jules Brulatour in 1935 In 1914 Brulatour funded the construction of larger studios for Peerless Pictures at Fort Lee as well as the rebuilding of Eclair's processing laboratory, storage vault and offices, which had burned, destroying negatives for almost all the firm's films made over the last three years. Throughout 1915‚Äì1916, while his girlfriend appeared with moderate success in Metropolitan Opera House productions, Brulatour was promoted to the presidency of the Eastman Kodak Company. He also helped form another studio at Fort Lee, Paragon Films, for which he built a large facility specifically for the on-site production of Eastman stock. By 1917 Jules Brulatour was a very rich man, reportedly worth several million dollars, and he was increasingly powerful politically.New York Clipper, June 19, 1918, p. 13; Moving Picture News, April 20, 1918, p. 2353; George Creel, How We Advertised America (1920), p. 274. That year he was appointed to the executive committee of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry. Brulatour chiefly conferred with the group's War Cooperation Subcommittee, which networked with the US government for the promotion of public welfare and propaganda films.Billboard, September 9, 1916, p. 59; New York Dramatic Mirror, April 3, 1917, p. 14. It is believed that his sudden high profile in Washington, D.C. determined him to legitimize his relationship with Dorothy Gibson, whom he finally married on July 6, 1917, a week before his first conference with President Woodrow Wilson and United States Treasury Department Secretary McAdoo. The next year Jules Brulatour was invited to join the film division of President Wilson's Committee on Public Information, but this appointment was less fruitful. Arguments and financial troubles arose almost immediately, and allegations flew of undue influence from media baron William Randolph Hearst and even of bribes from Brulatour; nothing was proven but he resigned under pressure. Privately, Brulatour's life was also unraveling. His marriage to Dorothy infuriated his first wife, who started proceedings against him, claiming the union was illegal since he had obtained a divorce in Kentucky instead of New York, the state of his residency. This was a drawn-out, complicated affair, and the stress ruined his second marriage, which was finally dissolved as an invalid contract in 1919, a humiliated Dorothy Gibson leaving New York shortly thereafter to live in relative peace and anonymity in Paris.New York Herald, August 27, 1919; Randy Bryan Bigham, Finding Dorothy (2012), pp. 90-92. She was allotted alimony and permitted the use of the Brulatour name. Jules Brulatour married a third time in 1923. His new wife was starlet Hope Hampton, a Texas-born beauty queen who was just beginning in movies. Though still head of Kodak, Brulatour was increasingly interested in his new bride's career, which he personally managed. Like Dorothy before her, Hope's film work was short-lived, and she took another page from her predecessor's book when she decided to go into opera, urged on and funded by Brulatour. In 1926, after a three-year investigation of Kodak by the Federal Trade Commission, Brulatour was severely fined, along with George Eastman, for \\"conspiracy to hinder and restrain commercial competition.\\"New York Times, April 30, 1923; April 21, 1924; May 19, 1925; and May 8, 1926. The French Legion of Honor was conferred on Brulatour in 1930 for his services to the motion picture industry during World War I.New York Times, July 27, 1930. The last 20 years of his life were largely uneventful. He and Hope were opening night regulars on Broadway; she especially was a magnet for press attention.New York Post, February 14, 1946; New York Sun, May 16, 1946. Giving up acting and singing by the early-1940s, Hope devoted herself to the high-life ‚Äì‚Äì entertaining lavishly, dressing extravagantly and delighting in being dubbed \\"Duchess of Park Avenue\\" in the society columns. But there were a few odd episodes, such as an unsolved shooting incident in 1939, in which Brulatour was wounded by a would-be assassin whom he refused to identify.New York Post, January 25, 1939. And in 1941, he was chagrined to learn that the boozy flop of an opera singer in Citizen Kane, the hit RKO film directed by and starring Orson Welles, was partly based on Hope and his ex-wife Dorothy.Randy Bryan Bigham, Finding Dorothy (2012), pp. 99-100.

This disease was named after the Barmah Forest in the northern Victoria region of Australia where it was first isolated in 1974. The first documented case in humans was in 1986. As of 2015, it has been found only in Australia. Although there is no specific treatment for infection with the Barmah Forest virus, the disease is non-fatal and most infected people recover.Barmah Forest Virus Queensland Health. Queensland Government. 11 May 2011. Retrieved 16 February 2012. The virus was discovered in 1974 in mosquitoes in the Barmah Forest in northern Victoria.Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus‚Äîthe facts. Department of Health, Victoria, Australia. 28 July 2009. Retrieved 16 February 2012. The virus has gradually spread from the sub-tropical northern areas of Victoria to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia (WA). People are more likely to contract the disease in summer and autumn in Australia. In the south west of WA, however, spring has been found to have the highest incidence. Transmission The virus can only be transmitted to humans by bites from infected mosquitoes. A number of mosquito species have been associated with vectoring the virus, including the Aedes vigilax and Culex annulirostris mosquito species. Direct contact with an infected person or animal does not cause infection. The virus is hosted mainly by marsupials, especially possums, kangaroos and wallabies. Symptoms Symptoms include fever, malaise, rash, arthralgia, and muscle tenderness. Fever and malaise generally disappear within a few days to a week, but other symptoms such as joint pain may continue for six months or longer. The Barmah Forest virus causes similar symptoms as the Ross River virus, although they usually persist longer in persons infected with the latter.Ross River Virus & Barmah Forest Virus in WA . Environmental Health Directorate. Department of Health, Western Australia 2006. Retrieved 16 February 2012. Most people may recover within a few weeks, but the minority can continue to have the symptoms for many months, and in the most severe cases, up to a year. A full recovery will be expected. Diagnosis The Barmah Forest virus is diagnosed by examination of blood serum collected from potentially infected people.  Documented cases  Barmah Forest virus (BFV) is the second most prevalent arbovirus in Australia. It is causing an epidemic polyarthritis throughout the country. No known deaths have been caused as a result of BFV and can affect all people regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. During the years of 1995‚Äì2008 15592 BFV cases were recorded in Australia. Of these, Queensland recorded the highest number of cases being 8050, which was over 50% of all cases. In 2011, 1855 people were diagnosed with BFV. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of the number of BFV cases around Australia. This increase could be as a result of urban development and changes to land and irrigation practices which ultimately allow for increased mosquito breeding resulting in more BFV outbreaks. Prevention The type of mosquito that transmits the virus can alter: the best way to ascertain an area is affected is by contact with local Health Officers. Precautions include: * Removing water build-up to stop mosquitos from breeding. * In the afternoon and early evening wear light coloured clothing which is loose fitted. * Regular use of insect repellent which can be used against mosquitos on exposed skin. * 'Knock-down' insecticide before bed to clear out your house. * Insect screening, including fireplaces, in hot weather.  Treatment  There is currently no specific treatment for the virus. The only treatment is trying to control and get rid of the symptoms that may occur. A doctor will advise and give treatment for the joint and muscle pain which involves resting and gentle exercise (to keep joints moving) . Medication may sometimes be necessary, but not always.

He first appeared in the novel Interview with the Vampire, but also makes appearances in The Queen of the Damned, and briefly in Blood and Gold. He is also briefly mentioned in The Vampire Armand. Fictional biography Daniel was the young, unnamed \\"reporter boy\\" who interviewed Louis de Pointe du Lac in Interview with the Vampire. He is described as a tall, slender young man with ashen blonde hair, violet eyes and 'a student's face'. After the interview (and Louis's refusal to turn him into a vampire), he became absorbed in finding Lestat de Lioncourt and leaves San Francisco for New Orleans to search for him. He did not find Lestat but he did find Lestat's watch and Armand in Lestat's house. Armand was fascinated with Daniel and chased him around the world for approximately four years before they began a relationship as 'secret lovers' together for another eight years. Daniel is given a small vial of Armand's blood to wear around his neck as protection from other vampires, who would sense the power in Armand's blood. Together they traveled and spent time in England, New York City, and finally settled off the coast of Florida on an island resort that Armand dubbed \\"Night Island.\\" Daniel is despondent, however ‚Äì he desires more than anything to become a vampire and Armand holds out from doing so for a long time. Daniel continues to hunger for immortality, and Armand persistently refuses. This dichotomy of the two switching between the role of the dominant and submissive partner adds a sado-masochistic undertone to their relationship. Armand needs Daniel as a teacher and guide in the modern world, where Daniel needs Armand in order to survive (he self-destructs any time he attempts to leave Armand). They are trapped in a game where neither is truly master or slave. Daniel does not appear in The Vampire Lestat but returns (and is named) in The Queen of the Damned. Ultimately, it becomes clear to Armand that Daniel is truly dying, in part from extensive alcohol abuse. Against his better judgment, Armand performs the Dark Gift, making Daniel an immortal vampire. This occurs on their private jet, just before Lestat's San Francisco concert. Daniel was thirty or thirty-two when transformed. There are some discrepancies in the Vampire Chronicles timeline that leave Daniel's exact age uncertain. Shortly after the events in The Queen of the Damned, Daniel leaves Armand. Having disrupted the cycle of master/slave by receiving what he wanted, the pair can no longer stand one another. It is not known what happened to Daniel after the separation. We obtain insight into Daniel and his relationship with Armand in The Vampire Armand. Armand states that he made Daniel a vampire out of loneliness, and because Daniel was dying. Armand believes a vampire will inevitably come to hate its creator, so he knew in making Daniel immortal that he was setting into motion the end of their relationship. At the time of The Vampire Armand, Armand knows that Daniel is alive, wandering, and powerful enough to survive on his own. Armand knows that by making Daniel a vampire, he turned his romanticism of the morbid into something far darker and more dangerous, but he does not at this time seem to know that Daniel is going mad. Daniel emerges again in Blood and Gold in the care of Marius. Here he seems to have lost his mind and is obsessed with making toy cities. However, Marius says that his faculties will be restored to him in time. In Prince Lestat, Marius saved Daniel's sanity. They are companions living together in Rio.  Vampire family Daniel Molloy in movies In the 1994 film Interview with the Vampire, Daniel Molloy is played by Christian Slater. The role was originally supposed to go to River Phoenix, who died before the scenes involving Molloy were shot (most of the film had already been completed). Slater took on the role at the last minute, donating his salary to Phoenix' favourite charities. At the end of this film, Molloy is not bitten by Louis in the house on Divisadero Street, but rather by Lestat in his car while driving over the Golden Gate Bridge. It is hinted at that Daniel has accepted that becoming a vampire is a bad idea, but that Lestat's biting him will leave him with the options of either dying or accepting the Dark Gift. This is the very end of the movie, and we do not know what Molloy chooses or what happens to him. He does not appear in the 2002 film Queen of the Damned, even though the book devotes a great deal of time to his relationship with Armand. Armand, played by Matthew Newton, is seen at the rock concert and Sonoma house without Daniel.

It was published in three parts: Iceland's Bell (1943), The Bright Jewel or The Fair Maiden (1944) and Fire in Copenhagen (1946). The novel takes place in the 18th century, mostly in Iceland and Denmark. Like many of Laxness's works, the story paints a tragic and ironic picture of the terrible state of the Icelandic populace in the 18th century. Plot summary=Part 1 ‚Äì Iceland's Bell The first part tells the story of the farmer J√≥n Hreggvi√∞sson and his battle with the Icelandic authorities. J√≥n is sentenced to death for the murder of an executioner, an official of the King of Denmark, but manages to flee from Iceland to Denmark, where he hopes to get an interview with the King to persuade him to grant a pardon.

This character is based on an actual historical figure, Thordis J√≥nsd√≥ttir, who was the daughter of the bishop of H√≥lar and was widely considered at the time to be the most beautiful woman in southern Iceland. Her husband, squire Magn√∫s Sigur√∞sson, was wealthy and well- fed, as well as a violent alcoholic. Part 3 ‚Äì Fire in Copenhagen The third part is about Arnas Arnaeus the manuscript-collector and the fate of his collection in Copenhagen. In the end, Arnas does not marry the woman of his heart, Sn√¶fr√≠√∞ur, but stays with his rich Danish wife who financed his life's work. Background The character Arnas Arn√¶us is based on √Årni Magn√∫sson, an Icelandic scholar who collected and preserved a great deal of medieval manuscripts.

This means that it is not Critically Endangered, but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future. This is because the population is very small and characterized by an acute restriction in its area of occupancy. It is therefore prone to the effects of human activities (or stochastic events, the impact of which is increased by human activities) within a very short period of time in an unforeseeable future. Therefore, it is possible that this species may become Critically Endangered or even Extinct within a very short period of time. ReferencesFurther reading *Boulenger GA (1887). \\"III.

A metal interior stairway is used to ascend the observation deck on top. It stands above sea level and provides an expansive view of the greater Meriden, Connecticut area. Origin and details Castle Craig, dedicated October 29, 1900 and given to the people of Meriden, Connecticut by Walter Hubbard is part of the Hubbard Park named after Hubbard. There are hiking trails to the tower (most notably the Metacomet Trail) as well as Reservoir Road which is open for vehicular traffic from May 1 to October 31 - 10 AM to 4:45 PM. Walkers and joggers are allowed use of this road 365 days of the year during normal park operating hours which is basically sunrise to sunset. From the top of the observation tower, elevation, it is possible to see New Haven and Long Island Sound to the south. To the west, the foothills of the Berkshires are visible; to the north, the Hartford skyline as well as the summit of Mount Tom in Massachusetts. The inspiration for the tower's design has been disputed for years. Some say Walter Hubbard, a world traveler, was inspired by a Norman French tower; others by a 12th Century Turkish tower on the Danube; still others maintain that it was patterned upon an ancient tower in Craigellachie, Scotland. Dedication of Tower  Postcard, circa 1910-1920 On October 29, 1900 dedicatory exercises were held at which Mr. Hubbard formally presented the Tower to the City of Meriden. According to a local newspaper, Plaque A plaque at the bottom of the tower reads as follows: Although the plaque indicates that East Peak is \\"the highest point within of the coast from Maine to Florida,\\" West Peak, just to the west, at 1,024 feet (312 m), is higher than both East Peak and the tower. Both East and West Peak are lower than a number of mountains in the Downeast coastal region of Maine. References *Image of the Plaque Livejournal.com *DeLorme Topo 6.0. Mapping software.

Since June 16, 2018, the Fox Report has been anchored by Jon Scott. The Fox Report is broadcast live on Saturday evenings at 6:00 p.m. Sunday evenings at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time , and the Saturday broadcast is replayed at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on Sunday. Overview The program is described as Fox News Channel's \\"newscast of record\\" and utilizes a similar story length and pacing as competing evening news programs aired by the Big Three broadcast television networks (ABC World News Tonight, the CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News). It is the highest- rated newscast among the United States cable news channels, averaging about 1.5 million viewers per broadcast ‚Äì far less than even the lowest-rated broadcast network newscast (CBS at 6.5 million). The program features Fox News correspondents and guests analyzing issues in shorter-form segments, which typically run no more than three or four minutes per story. Up to 70 stories are covered within each broadcast. The program eschews the use of \\"talking heads\\", and focuses on field reporting and comments from individuals directly involved in the story. One common feature is \\"Around the World in 80 Seconds\\" (a play on the Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days), a segment taking a quick look at interesting stories from around the world. \\"Across America\\" is a similarly formatted segment ‚Äì albeit not subject to time restrictions ‚Äì which features human interest stories culled from local newscasts seen on affiliates of the Fox broadcast network. The Fox Report was rebroadcast at 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time weeknights from the program's debut until the late-night airing was replaced by the comedy/news commentary show Red Eye on February 6, 2007. In lieu of a national news program (other than the political talk show Fox News Sunday) on the Fox network or local news programming on the service itself at the time of its launch, the program was also simulcast on Foxnet (a national cable feed of the Fox network distributed to markets without access to a local Fox station) from 1996 (at the program's inception as The Schneider Report) until Foxnet ceased operations on September 12, 2006. History=Early history When Fox News Channel launched on October 7, 1996, the network debuted its first \\"regular\\" evening newscast, the Schneider Report. Anchored by former NBC News and ABC News correspondent Mike Schneider, the program included interviews with guests and was kept as close to center in terms of its political coverage as possible. Format change as the Fox Report Fox Report logo from 2005 to 2007. After Schneider left FNC in 1997, the program was reformatted as the Fox News Report, with Jon Scott and Catherine Crier taking over as co-anchors. At its start, the Fox Report aired on Monday through Friday evenings. After Crier left FNC to become a host/correspondent for Court TV (now truTV) and Scott was subsequently removed as an anchor, Paula Zahn became the solo anchor of the program, then retitled as the Fox Report with Paula Zahn. Zahn anchored the newscast until she became host of The Edge later that year, at which point Shepard Smith was named the program's main anchor and its title amended as simply the Fox Report. This marked the first incarnation of what would become the flashy, fast-paced newscast it evolved into under Smith's tenure. In particular, Smith started the trend of peppering news scripts with participles instead of using complete sentences. Shortly after the September 11th attacks in 2001, Fox News Channel added editions of the program on Saturday and Sunday evenings, expanding the Fox Report to seven nights a week. Rick Folbaum served as the original anchor of the Saturday broadcasts, he later added the Sunday editions to his duties and became substitute for Smith on the weeknight editions until Folbaum left FNC in early 2006, when he was replaced by Trace Gallagher, who himself anchored the weekend editions until he was reassigned by FNC in 2007 to become the program's chief correspondent. Laurie Dhue, who was the original anchor of the program's Sunday edition from 2001 to 2005, returned to the program as anchor of both the Saturday and Sunday broadcasts until she departed FNC in 2008, Dhue was then succeeded on the weekend broadcasts by Julie Banderas. Fox Report logo from 2007 to 2009. Throughout 2007, the program shifted toward a more serious tone, removing pre-break story teasers, jokes, and a number of other elements, including the \\"G-Block\\", a segment featuring mostly entertainment and celebrity news (which became notable for an incident in November 2002 that eventually went viral in which Shepard Smith made a slip of the tongue during a story on Jennifer Lopez, mistakenly stating that residents from the Bronx neighborhood where the actress/singer grew up would rather give her a \\"curb job than a blow job, er... a bl-block party\\" if she returned there). On September 24, 2007, the program relocated to Studio E, an elaborate, state-of-the-art set (which is also used by fellow FNC shows Fox & Friends and Your World with Neil Cavuto) which incorporates LED and plasma projection screens, the program introduced a new music and graphics package. However, the weekend editions of the program continued to be produced from Fox News' main studio. On December 10, 2008, the program moved again to Studio 12H, a set designed for high-definition broadcasts that was first used for the Fox News-produced 2008 Election Night coverage on the Fox broadcast network, with \\"The Cube\\" ‚Äì a large video display object featuring display of imagery on three facets of the cube ‚Äì as a major element, both the weekday and weekend broadcasts were produced out of the new studio. The Fox Report debuted a new on-air look on September 28, 2009, which included new graphics and a remix of the previous theme music. In early 2011, Harris Faulkner took over as the program's weekend anchor, a move made long-term on April 25, 2011. Fox Report logo from 2009 to October 9, 2011. On October 10, 2011, the Fox Report (and its sister program, Studio B) introduced a new graphics package incorporating a lower-third graphics set mirroring that previously rolled out on two other Fox News shows, The Five and Happening Now. Shepard Smith presented the show from a modified Studio 12H that featured additional monitors as well as \\"The Cube,\\" although the overhead platform and accompanying staircase (which had been part of the set since 2008) were removed. During the week of September 26, 2011 to October 2, 2011, the Fox Report moved back into its former Studio E (with Studio B being moved into the newsroom), while renovations on Studio 8H were ongoing; both the Fox Report and Studio B were moved into a new set at the studio on October 10, 2011. Relegation to weekends On September 12, 2013, Fox News Channel announced that it would cut the weeknight editions of the Fox Report and in order to make room for On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren, which would be displaced from its longtime 10:00 p.m. Eastern time slot to make room for The Kelly File when that program debuted on October 7, 2013. In addition, as part of a new multi-year contract with Fox News Channel the day of the announcement of the evening schedule realignment, FNC also announced that Shepard Smith would be reassigned to serve as managing editor of its new breaking news division (under which capacity, Smith would serve as primary anchor of the network's breaking news coverage), while remaining as its chief news anchor and anchor of his mid-afternoon news program (which was retitled from Studio B to Shepard Smith Reporting). Smith anchored his last edition of the Fox Report on the day of the announcement, with the weeknight editions being anchored by substitutes until the program was relegated exclusively to weekends after the October 4, 2013 edition. On May 12, 2014, FNC announced that it would return to a separate anchor format for the Fox Reports weekend broadcasts, with Julie Banderas returning to the program as anchor of the Saturday edition; Harris Faulkner would retain her role as anchor of the Sunday editions (her removal from the Saturday broadcasts was the result of her being named co-host of FNC's weekday panel talk show Outnumbered. Banderas initially served as one of three rotating anchors of the Saturday broadcast, along with John Roberts and Shannon Bream, before becoming sole anchor later in the year.

Clog dancing is a form of step dance characterised by the wearing of inflexible, wooden soled clogs. Clog dancing developed into differing intricate forms both in Wales and also in the North of England. Welsh clog dancing mainly originates from various slate mines where workers would compete against each other during work breaks. Northern English traditional clog dancing originates from Lancashire, Yorkshire, County Durham, Northumberland and the Lake District. Welsh and English clogs, with leather uppers and a sole cut from alder or sycamore were the regular, everyday footwear for working people all over Britain until the 1920s. Dancing clogs are close fitting which allows the dancer more control over the movements of their feet. English clogs with an iron or rubber protective layer on the sole are also worn for North west morris. The main focus of a step dancer is in the footwork: dancers can create many different types of sound using their feet alone. Clog dancing was often performed very casually, people would dance at home, in the pubs or in the street. The upper part of the body was kept relatively motionless so it required little space. A Welsh solo clog dancer extinguishing a candle using the sole edges of his clogs at the National Urdd Eisteddfod in Eryri, 2012. In the 1800s clog dancing competitions became popular. Large amounts of money could be won or lost on the clog competitions which were seen as a type of sport. Like modern-day jockeys, dancers would perform in colours which would have made them easy to identify. Both men and women danced in breeches which would have allowed their leg movements to be seen. Clog dancing was also performed on the stage. In the Victorian period clog dancing was a popular act in music hall or variety shows. Often people would wear special themed costumes as part of their act. The famous comedian Charlie Chaplin started his career in music halls as a clog dancer. Welsh Clog dancing tradition is unbroken and continues to exist in many festivals in Wales, mainly the National \\"Eisteddfodau\\". These include the Urdd National Eisteddfod, the National Eisteddfod of Wales and the Llangollen International Eisteddfod. Both the Urdd and National Eisteddfod occur in a different part of Wales each year. The competitive Welsh style of dance varies from stylised group dancing to a more traditional and natural dancing scene. Welsh clog dancing is also performed individually by both men and women. The male style of dance is particularly dynamic, including so-called \\"tricks\\" usually performed at the end of a performance. Solo Welsh male dancers are therefore required to have far more athletic abilities when compared with the English clog dancer. English clog dancing traditions still exist in some festivals in Northumbria, and are danced to the traditional music of the region. Clog dancing is also still practised in parts of Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Cumbria and Derbyshire and there are teams dancing the Northern traditional dances (and newer ones) in many other parts of England. Clog dance competitions currently held in England include the Lancashire and Cheshire Clog Dancing Contests (focussing on Lancashire style clog dancing) held every September as part of the Fylde Folk Festival in Fleetwood, and the Northern Counties Clog Dancing Championships (focussing on Durham and Northumberland style clog dancing) held every year in Tyne and Wear. Welsh Clog Dancing A Welsh clog dancing trio performing in the National Urdd Eisteddfod, 2012 (Eryri). A Welsh clog dancer performing a \\"toby\\" at a preliminary solo competition of the 2017 National Eisteddfod in Bodedern. Origin Clog dancing in Wales originates mostly from slate quarries and farmers also. Workers would attempt to out-perform each other during work breaks by performing more extravagant and striking \\"steps\\" and \\"tricks\\" to impress their co-workers. The slate that was produced in the quarries could be used as a platform to clog dance and slate is still used even today in \\"eisteddfod\\" competitions. Style Welsh Clog Dancing is unique and is not a revival, as it is danced in the style of the unbroken tradition.\\" Welsh clog dancing is stylistically distinct from English clog dancing with new steps and \\"tricks\\" constantly being invented as part of Eisteddfod competitions. For example, extinguishing a candle, toby stepping (propelling the feet forward alternatively in a squat position), stradle jumps, handkerchief jumps, stepping and jumping over brooms are performed. Welsh clog dancing, especially solo dancing has evolved to become much more dynamic than English clog dancing. Modern competition Clog dancing is an integral part of both the local and national eisteddfod tradition in Wales. Competitions since the 1960s have extended to dancing duets and trios which meant that groups could recreate on stage the true tradition where one dancer was trying to out-dance the other. Group clogging has also become an integral part of the eisteddfodau and dancing tradition. Competition can be energetic with the dancers leaping over brooms as seen in the National Eisteddfod Male Welsh Clog Dancing Competition\\". Notable dancing groups include Natgarw Dancers hailing from the Pontypridd area and Talog dancers from Camarthern. Both groups have enjoyed significant success in National Eisteddfod competitions. Nantgarw dancers have also had significant success in international competitions such as the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales, Lorient Folk Festival in France and Mallorca World Folk Festival in Spain. English clog dancing Today, there are three predominant styles of English clog dancing. *Northumberland and Durham style: bears a resemblance to Irish dancing. It is chracterised by neat and precise body movements with almost no upper-body movement. *Lancashire style: very distinct from Northumbrian clogging and more flamboyant in style. *Lakeland style or Westmorland Reel: typically danced as a reel with eight bars of stepping followed by a reel of three. Four English clog dancers, at Saltaire History English clog dancing began in 18th century England during the Industrial Revolution. It is thought to have developed in the Lancashire cotton mills where wooden-soled clogs were preferred to leather soles because the floors were kept wet to help keep the humidity high, important in cotton spinning. At their breaks and lunches, they would have competitions, where they were judged on the best rhythm patterns. Workers, wearing their working clogs would perform in the street, in pubs, and during social occasions. For example, in Lancashire, wooden-soled clogs were worn in the mills, and on Dartmoor, hard-soled leather shoes or boots would have been worn for farming. By the late 1800s they clog danced on proper stages at competitions. In these competitions, the judges would watch the routine and judge it according to footwork, precision, and technique. Clog dancers were a common sight at music halls throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century. One such group was The Eight Lancashire Lads which included a young Charlie Chaplin as one of its members. Dan Leno became the world champion clog dancer in the 1880s, although records show that competitive clog dancing was a frequent occurrence throughout the 19th century. English clog and step dancers in Grenoside, Sheffield.Cecil Sharp frequently encountered step dancing, clog dancing and North West morris dancing (a type of morris often performed in clogs, but not the same as clog dancing) in his search for folk dances in England, but it was Maud Karpeles who was more effective in documenting some of these dances. She encountered groups of North West morris dancers in the North-West of England. Her book The Lancashire Morris Dance was published in 1930. It contained arrangements of the common Morris tunes: Rush cart lads, The girl I left behind me, Corn rigs, Sawney was tall ‚Äì Radstock jig, Balquhidder lasses, Shepton hornpipe, Nancy Dawson and Cross Morris. (accompanied by tunes as pianoforte arrangements by Arnold Foster. Rush cart lads ‚Äì The girl I left behind me ‚Äì Corn rigs, or, Sawney was tall ‚Äì Radstock jig ‚Äì Balquhidder lasses ‚Äì Shepton hornpipe ‚Äì Nancy Dawson, or, Cross Morris. In 1911 John Graham had published Lancashire and Cheshire Morris Dances from the same area. In the USA, English clog steps were combined with African rhythms to form \\"buck and wing dancing\\", and that evolved into Tap dance. Nowadays, clogs, tap shoes, and hard-soled shoes are all worn depending on the style of dance. Dances and steps are most notably found in the North East, the Lake District, and Lancashire. As well as being danced in social settings, there are also some competitions, which has helped define some of the styles.Competition style dancing is often focused on very precise footwork with very little upper-body movement. Costume Clog dancers today wear a mixture of costumes inspired by the Victorian and Edwardian clothing of the northern workers. Dancers also wear contemporary clothing and fashion. Some have specially made costumes, often with a waistcoat or bodice which is worn with a long skirt. Pat Tracey (1959) described the everyday clothing worn by clog dancers performing in streets in the early 20th century;\\"For their performance the dancers usually wore their normal working clothes ‚Äì brown fustian trousers, striped shirt with red muffler knotted round the neck, navy blue jacket and soft cap. They danced in their everyday clogs though these were usually somewhat lighter in weight than those worn by the majority of weavers...the street dancers normally belonged to a set of rather dandified working youths and the lighter clog was part of their accepted dress.\\" Some dancers now wear mill workers working clothing or Sunday best, whilst others wear more modern outfits. On Dartmoor, in East Anglia and in the Romany/Gypsy and Traveller community, everyday clothing is worn. Current tradition & festivals Clog dancing still occurs in some festivals in North East England where it is typically danced to the traditional music of Northumbria. Dancing traditions still exist in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Cumbria and Derbyshire and other parts of England. Clog dance competitions currently held in England include the Lancashire and Cheshire Clog Dancing Contests (focussing on Lancashire style) held every September as part of the Fylde Folk Festival in Fleetwood, and the Northern Counties Clog Dancing Championships (focussing on Durham and Northumberland style clog dancing) held every year in Tyne and Wear. Dutch clog dancing \\"Boerendansen\\" at the end of this news- clip from 1951Traditional dancing in the Netherlands is often called \\"Folkloristisch\\", sometimes \\"Boerendansen\\" (\\"farmer-dancing\\") or \\"Klompendansen\\" (clog dancing). Wooden shoes are worn as an essential part of the traditional costume for Dutch clogging, or Klompendanskunst. Clogs for dancing are made lighter than the traditional 700-year-old design. The soles are made from ash wood, and the top part is cut lower by the ankle. Dancers create a rhythm by tapping the toes and heels on a wooden floor. Descendent traditions in the USA In the United States, team clogging originated from square dance teams in Asheville, North Carolina's Mountain Dance and Folk Festival (1928), organised by Bascom Lamar Lunsford in the Appalachian region. American Clogging is associated with the predecessor to bluegrass‚Äî\\"old-time\\" music, which is based on fiddle tunes from the British Isles. Clogging developed from aspects of English, Welsh, German, and Cherokee step dances, as well as African rhythms and movement. It was from clogging that tap dance eventually evolved. Solo dancing (outside the context of the big circle dance) is known in various places as buck dance, flatfooting, hoedown, jigging, sure- footing, and stepping. The names vary in meaning, and dancers do not always agree on their use. Buck dancing was the earliest combination of the basic shuffle and tap steps performed to syncopated rhythms in which accents are placed not on the straight beat, as with the jigs, clogs, and other dances of European origin, but on the downbeat or offbeat, a style derived primarily from the rhythms of African tribal music. Traditional Appalachian clogging is characterised by loose, often bent knees and a \\"drag-slide\\" motion of the foot across the floor, and is usually performed to old-time music. Miscellaneous clog dancing= Music hall  Clog dancers included Charlie Chaplin and Jack Wilson and Joe Keppel of Wilson, Keppel and Betty.  Ballet  The ballet La fille mal gard√©e contains a well-known clog dance. Trivia In 2006, nearly 500 teenagers attempted the \\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" bid for the largest number of clog dancers. It took place in The Hague. They were dancing the ballet version of the Dutch clog dance rather than the folk version. For this specific dance the choreography was created by Stanley Holden (1928‚Äì2007), though Frederick Ashton took overall responsibility for it.

Located in the city of Topeka, which has served as the capital of Kansas since the territory became a state in 1861, the building is the second to serve as the Kansas Capitol. During the territorial period (1854‚Äì1861), an earlier capitol building was begun but not completed in Lecompton, Kansas, and smaller structures in Lecompton and Topeka were where the territorial legislatures met (see Capitols of Kansas). The dome, at , is taller than the United States Capitol dome, although its diameter () is approximately half that of the national capitol (). It is one of the few capitols in the United States that continue to offer tours that go to the top of the dome. Visitors enter the dome by climbing 296 steps leading from the fifth floor to the top. History=19th century The land for Capitol Square was donated by Cyrus K. Holliday via his Topeka Town Company in 1862. The master architect was Edward Townsend Mix with the wings designed by John G. Haskell. Construction on the East Wing began in 1866, using \\"native\\" limestone from Geary County, Kansas. Construction began on the West Wing in 1879 using limestone from Cottonwood Falls, Kansas and in 1881, the legislature authorized and appropriated funds for the construction of a central building to link the two wings. Construction of this central building began in 1886, and the contract for dome construction was let in May, 1889. 20th century Under construction The building was declared officially complete in 1903, after 37 years of construction. It was not until 1988 that a design for a sculpture to stand atop the dome was finally approved. Ad Astra, a bronze sculpture weighing , was installed atop the dome on October 10, 2002. The sculpture, by Richard Bergen, depicts a Kansa Native American with bow and arrow pointed at the North Star and was chosen from 27 entries to adorn the dome. The title Ad Astra is Latin shortening of the state motto Ad Astra Per Aspera To the stars through difficulty. 21st century Looking up at the dome's interior in 2008 The building was featured prominently on Kansas license plates issued from January 2001 until April 2007. In December 2001, the Statehouse began a $120 million modernization project, led by Treanor Architects; the project included restoration of its first through fifth floors, the rehabilitation and expansion of its basement, restoration of its exterior masonry and copper roof/dome. By the time the project finished in spring 2014, scope creep and delays resulted in a total cost of $332 million, covering \\"new heating and cooling systems, greater security and restroom accessibility, a new parking garage, visitor center, underground office space and replacing the roof and dome.\\" Frescos and murals In 1898, Jerome Fedeli painted frescos near the top of the dome in the rotunda. Fedeli's work depicted bare-breasted classical women. However officials referred to the paintings as \\"Nude Telephone Girls\\" and had them painted-over. Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (left) and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan observe John Steuart Curry's Tragic Prelude in the second floor rotunda In the 1930s, John Steuart Curry painted murals on the second floor including the building's most famous painting‚ÄîTragic Prelude‚Äîwhich depicts an oversize and raging John Brown wedged between the warring sides of the American Civil War, flanked by flames and a tornado. Curry's work gained considerable notoriety for depicting unsavory aspects of Kansas history and he left them unsigned and did not complete a commission to paint murals in the rotunda. Curry's depiction of Brown is believed to be the only instance of a person convicted of treason being featured in a state capitol. From 1976 to 1978, Lumen Martin Winter painted the murals in the rotunda.

Like other Liberty ships, she was 441 feet (134 m) long and 56 feet (17 m) wide, carried 9000 tons of cargo and had a top speed of 11 knots (20 km/h). Most Liberty ships were named after prominent deceased Americans. This particular ship was built by Delta Shipbuilding Company in New Orleans. Her keel was laid on 25 October 1944 and she was launched on 4 December 1944. The Delta shipyard was started specifically for the war effort, at a site on the Industrial Canal near the Almonaster Avenue Bridge, immediately south of the present-day I-10 high-rise bridge. The yard was shut down after the end of the war. The Martin Behrman survived World War II and saw service in the Korean War. In 1947 she was engaged in the Indonesian trade in defiance of a Dutch blockade, and on one voyage her cargo was confiscated by the Dutch Navy. She was scrapped at Portland, Oregon in 1965.

It housed a number of orcas: Haida, Nootka, and Tilikum. In 1991, all three were involved in an incident in which a trainer, Keltie Byrne, was killed. The aquarium subsequently closed and sold its orcas to SeaWorld. History The aquarium opened in 1969, housing an orca named Haida which had been captured in 1968.frontline: a whale of a business: viewer discussion Shortly afterward, the aquarium decided to capture a mate for him, taking a partial albino named Chimo. She died in 1972, a little over 2 years after her capture; the disease which caused her albinism, Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi syndrome, made her very susceptible to illness. Haida, her mate, mourned her death, and remained alone for years. Eventually, Sealand captured a female whale named Nootka II for his mate. Nootka II, however, died after 9 months. His third mate, Nootka III, was also short-lived. By the time of the death of his third mate, Haida displayed no interest in them. In 1977, Dr. Murray Newman, founding director of the aquarium, got a call from Campbell River, B.C., resident William Davis, who claimed he was feeding a sick baby killer whale by hand in the wild. Newman then called Dr Michael Bigg, head of Marine Mammal Research at the Pacific Biological Station in Naniamo, B.C. Bigg, in turn, called Sealand and Bob Wright, who took Angus Mathews, Dr. Alan Hoey, and Bigg by float plane to Menzies Bay to investigate the claim. They discovered the story was true and that the baby killer whale was suffering from a bullet wound. Sealand, with permission from Bigg and Davis, decided to rescue the baby whale and take her back to Victoria for emergency care. Miracle became a popular attraction but was kept in a separate pen from Haida. Several years later, her companion in the pen, a seal named Shadow, drowned in the nets forming the pen. Sealand diver Larry McInerney stated in the documentary Who Killed Miracle? that she had drowned by becoming trapped between the double-net system at the aquarium. McInerney also noted, which was corroborated by Alexandra Morton in the film, that Miracle had learned that by damaging the nets, divers would come into pen and she could play with the divers. Miracle's play had become aggressive and was a safety problem for the divers, preventing proper maintenance of the pens. Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard, a killer whale expert, determined that Miracle was a southern resident killer whale, which were known to play rough with other sea mammals in the wild. These factors combined to cause the whale's death. As anti-captivity protests began to put pressure on aquariums, Sealand agreed to release Haida, but the animal died a few days before its scheduled release in October 1982, with no evidence of foul play. His release had been part for the aquarium to acquire new whales. Many people were outraged by the plan of capturing more whales and staged a protest at the supposed capture site. Sealand soon obtained three whales captured from Iceland. The three new orcas, Tilikum, Nootka IV, and Haida II, never had good dynamics together; the male, Tilikum, was often bullied and chased into the medical pen by the two females. 1991 accident and closure On 20 February 1991, Keltie Byrne, a 21-year-old marine biology student and part-time orca trainer, slipped and fell into the whale pool after a show. Tilikum, Nootka IV, and Haida II dragged and repeatedly submerged her until she drowned, despite other trainers' efforts to rescue her. The poor relations between the whales, unfamiliarity with trainers in the water, and the pregnancy of at least one of the females (Haida II) were cited as possible causes.PBS: A whale of a business excerpts from chapter 7 of ‚ÄúThe Performing Orca ‚Äì Why the show must stop‚Äù by Erich Hoyt, Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, Bath U.K. 1992. Sealand of the Pacific closed shortly after the incident, in November 1992. All three of the whales were sold to SeaWorld in the United States. Tilikum and Nootka IV went to SeaWorld Orlando, while Haida II and her baby Kyuquot went to SeaWorld San Antonio. Kyuquot remains in captivity at SeaWorld.

The low prices are usually done to attract customers to shop at that store during the new year. The term is formed from Japanese fuku (Á¶è, meaning \\"good fortune\\" or \\"luck\\") and fukuro (Ë¢ã, meaning \\"bag\\"). The change of fukuro to bukuro is the phenomenon known as rendaku. The fuku comes from the Japanese saying that \\"there is fortune in leftovers\\" (ÊÆã„ÇäÁâ©„Å´„ÅØÁ¶è„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã). Popular stores' fukubukuro usually are snapped up quickly by eager customers, with some stores having long lines snake around city blocks hours before the store opens on New Year's Day. Fukubukuro are an easy way for stores to unload excess and unwanted merchandise from the previous year, due to a Japanese superstition that one must not start the New Year with unwanted items from the previous year and start clean. Nowadays, some fukubukuro are pushed as a lavish New Year's event, where the contents are revealed beforehand, but this practice is criticized as just a renaming of selling things as sets.  History  The concept of fukubukuro was invented by Ginza Matsuya Department Store in the late Meiji era and has since spread to most retailers. The custom has spread to other cultures; for example, in the Honolulu shopping center Ala Moana Center, several stores adopted in this tradition in 2004. Many Sanrio Stores in the United States often adopt this tradition as well.  Contents  Fukubukuro on sale in Tokyo in 2013 Depending on the business, merchants plan out what will go into these grab bags and what the selling price will be months in advance. In major department stores, grab bags are usually themed to specific departments (e.g. a young adult section of the store would have fukubukuro with trendy merchandise, the shoe section would have several high priced shoes in the bag, etc.). In other stores (especially smaller stores), many fukubukuro are often filled with items that relate to the store or think kindly of the customers needs (e.g. a tea store would offer fukubukuro in a tea crate with bags of tea, tea cups, and blankets). Many stores often include extra items, such as expensive purses (sometimes worth well into the tens of millions of yen), tickets to far away places, even fur coats and vouchers for expensive electronics to entice shoppers to take a chance and shop at their store. The randomness of such inserts is a reason why fukubukuro are sometimes known as \\"good luck bags\\" or \\"lucky bags.\\" Vouchers are used if the items involved are large items that cannot be put inside a bag (e.g. large appliances), intangible goods, or services. Bags containing nothing but unwanted items are known colloquially as fuk≈çbukuro (\\"misfortune bags\\") or utsubukuro (\\"depressing bags\\"), and some stores which have nothing good to offer inside actually name their bags this and offer them at extremely low prices (such as 500‚Äì1000 yen). Fukubukuro come at a variety of different prices. Most bags are priced ranging from a few hundred to a few 10,000 yen (1-100 USD). However, every year there are also a few extremely expensive fukubukuro available. In 2006, the most expensive fukubukuro was priced at 200.6 million yen (1.7 million USD) at a Ginza Jewelry store. Another set of bags was priced at 150 million yen apiece (1.2 million USD) at Mitsukoshi.

High Wycombe lies east of the Perth CBD at the base of the Darling Scarp (commonly referred to as the foothills). Formerly part of Maida Vale, the suburb was officially declared on 2 June 1978; its name, which was first used in 1958 by a subdivider, Western Agencies, and refers to the town in Buckinghamshire where one of the partners in the firm was born. High Wycombe is directly east of Perth Airport, west of Maida Vale, north of Forrestfield, and south of the industrial suburb of Hazelmere. High Wycombe is a large suburb in area, with its main population centred on roads that connect from Newburn Road, and bounded by Kalamunda Road to the north, Dundas Road to the west, Maida Vale Road to the south, and Roe Highway to the east. The suburb's growth is mainly in this area, however the estate of Jacaranda Springs, which is based on the northern side of Kalamunda Road, is also experiencing growth. A sparsely populated area around Milner Road is also part of the suburb. Demographics In the , there were 12,308 people in High Wycombe. This marks an increase of 527 persons in comparison to the , which had the population at 11,781. Of these 49.7% were male and 50.3% were female. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.7% of the population.

The rally has its origin in the Loudon Classic motorcycle race started in 1923 and the Gypsy tour, where many motorcyclists passed through Laconia. Events were scheduled, including races, shows and a motorcycle hill climb competition. History The Laconia rally has its roots in June 1916, when a few hundred motorcyclists gathered at Weirs Beach in Laconia. Seven years later, the event was officially recognized by the Federation of American Motorcyclists (to be later called the American Motorcyclist Association) as part of the Gypsy Tour, where motorcyclists celebrated races and hill climbs for an entire weekend. The Federation of American Motorcyclists continued to sanction the event until 1960. Motorcyclists continued to return to Laconia in stronger numbers. Participants began flocking to Laconia earlier in the week until the rally unofficially became a week-long event. Local businesses became strong supporters of the event which kick-started the beginning of their busy tourist season. However, Laconia's Bike Week did see times of trouble. During the summer of 1965, a riot between motorcycle gangs and local police broke out, which brought national media attention to Laconia. The police and city officials began to view the rally as a major inconvenience. Laconia officials imposed stricter law enforcement, and the number of events during the week began to decline. The rally was eventually minimized to a three-day weekend and saw a large decline in the number of participants. It was not until the early 1990s that, in an effort to increase tourism, Laconia businesses approached the Federation of American Motorcyclists for their support to bring the rally back to a week- long event. Eventually the business owners joined in a coalition with local motorcycle groups and founded the Laconia Motorcycle Rally and Race Association, which organizes and schedules all events associated with motorcycle week. The group is also responsible for promoting the event nationwide and issuing licenses to vendors. Laconia Motorcycle week is now a nine-day event which will either start or end on Father's Day. Deaths For a number of years there have been deaths during the event. There were six deaths in 2001, one in 2002, two in 2003, five in 2004, four in 2005, six in 2006 (including at least one car driver not affiliated with the event), five in 2007, and seven in 2008. There were no deaths in 2009, but in 2010 three motorcyclists were killed. One cyclist was killed in 2011, four in 2012, four in 2013, one in 2016, one in 2018, and at least one in 2019. New Hampshire does not mandate wearing motorcycle helmets for riders over 18, which it has been claimed is a reason why some riders are attracted to events in the state. Some of the riders killed in accidents at Laconia Motorcycle Week have not worn helmets, and this is reported in the press.

It was built in 1711, and is the oldest remaining building in the city of Meriden. It is owned by the city, and is open for tours during the summer, or by appointment. Description and history The Solomon Goffe House is located north of downtown Meriden, on the east side of North Colony Street between Griswold and Maynard Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is eight bays wide, with two entrances and six windows; there are four shed-roof dormers on the front roof face. The interior has undergone significant alterations, but three downstairs rooms remain relatively unaltered, and other features are preserved elsewhere. The house was built about 1711 by Solomon Goffe, about whom little is known. It was probably constructed at first as a five-bay structure, with the northern three bays added later. It had received numerous small additions in the 20th century, most of which have been removed during restoration. Current use The house is currently a museum owned by the city. There are tours the first Sunday of the month from April to November 1:30pm to 4:30pm. Each month has a different theme. One of the highlights of the landscaping is its traditional herb garden, which was designed after examples of typical 18th century herb gardens in the area. The Archaeology Society of Connecticut has done some digs on the property and found a number of objects, including an axe blade.http://mudandmuck.com/ascnews2006.htm See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven County, Connecticut ReferencesExternal links * Solomon Goffe House - Meriden Patch Category:Buildings and structures in Meriden, Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1711 Goffe House Category:Saltbox architecture in Connecticut Category:Houses in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:Archaeological sites in Connecticut Category:Museums in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:Historic house museums in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:1711 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Solomon Goffe House"},{"id":"3593309","text":"In information theory, a relay channel is a probability model of the communication between a sender and a receiver aided by one or more intermediate relay nodes.  General discrete-time memoryless relay channel  A discrete memoryless single-relay channel can be modelled as four finite sets, X_1, X_2, Y_1, and Y, and a conditional probability distribution p(y,y_1x_1,x_2) on these sets. The probability distribution of the choice of symbols selected by the encoder and the relay encoder is represented by p(x_1,x_2). o------------------o  Relay Encoder  o------------------o Œõ y1 x2 V o---------o x1 o------------------o y o---------o  Encoder ---> p(y,y1x1,x2) ---> Decoder  o---------o o------------------o o---------o There exist three main relaying schemes: Decode-and-Forward, Compress-and- Forward and Amplify-and-Forward. The first two schemes were first proposed in the pioneer article by Cover and El-Gamal. * Decode-and-Forward (DF): In this relaying scheme, the relay decodes the source message in one block and transmits the re-encoded message in the following block. The achievable rate of DF is known as \\\\max_{p(x_1,x_2)} \\\\min \\\\left( I\\\\left( x_1; y_1  x_2 \\\\right) , I\\\\left( x_1, x_2 ; y \\\\right) \\\\right) . * Compress-and-Forward (CF): In this relaying scheme, the relay quantizes the received signal in one block and transmits the encoded version of the quantized received signal in the following block. The achievable rate of CF is known as \\\\max_{p(x_1)p(\\\\hat y_1  y_1)p(x_2)} I\\\\left( x_1; \\\\hat{y_1}, y  x_2 \\\\right) subject to I(x_2;y) \\\\geq I(y_1; \\\\hat y_1  y) . * Amplify-and-Forward (AF): In this relaying scheme, the relay sends an amplified version of the received signal in the last time- slot. Comparing with DF and CF, AF requires much less delay as the relay node operates time-slot by time-slot. Also, AF requires much less computing power as no decoding or quantizing operation is performed at the relay side.  Cut- set upper bound  The first upper bound on the capacity of the relay channel is derived in the pioneer article by Cover and El-Gamal and is known as the Cut-set upper bound. This bound says C \\\\leq \\\\max_{p(x_1,x_2)} \\\\min \\\\left( I\\\\left( x_1; y_1, y  x_2 \\\\right) , I\\\\left( x_1, x_2 ; y \\\\right) \\\\right) where C is the capacity of the relay channel. The first term and second term in the minimization above are called broadcast bound and multi-access bound, respectively.  Degraded relay channel  A relay channel is said to be degraded if y depends on x_1 only through y_1 and x_2, i.e., p(y  x_1, x_2, y_1) = p(y  x_2, y_1). In the article by Cover and El-Gamal it is shown that the capacity of the degraded relay channel can be achieved using Decode-and- Forward scheme. It turns out that the capacity in this case is equal to the Cut-set upper bound.  Reversely degraded relay channel  A relay channel is said to be reversely degraded if p(y, y_1  x_1, x_2) = p(y  x_1, x_2)p(y_1  y, x_2). Cover and El-Gamal proved that the Direct Transmission Lower Bound (wherein relay is not used) is tight when the relay channel is reversely degraded.  Feedback relay channel  Relay without delay channel  In a relay-without-delay channel (RWD), each transmitted relay symbol can depend on relay's past as well as present received symbols. Relay Without Delay was shown to achieve rates that are outside the Cut-set upper bound. Recently, it was also shown that instantaneous relays (a special case of relay-without- delay) are capable of improving not only the capacity, but also Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of the 2-user interference channel.

The hole cam became popular in 1999 when the Late Night Poker program first began using it in televised tournaments shown on British Channel 4. Cameras were also used in the Poker Million prior to gaining further popularity after the ESPN broadcasts of the 2002 World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour began airing on the Travel Channel in 2003. In some cases, the camera is placed under a glass panel in the table and players are instructed to place their cards over the glass (as in the case of High Stakes Poker). In other cases, the rail of the table is elevated and a small camera placed within the rail, and players are instructed to examine their cards in the usual manner, but while they're in front of the camera (as is the case on the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour). The goal in both cases is to allow for the filming and broadcast of the player's hole cards to the spectators without exposing them to the other players. This has led to the audience garnering a greater understanding of what is going on at the table and an increased interest in the thought processes of the players. If the tournament is broadcast live when hole-card cameras are in use, the players and/or live audience must be sequestered from the commentators, for fear of information being relayed to the players at the table. Also, the broadcast is delayed a few minutes for additional security. Most tournaments are not shown live, and for security purposes only a few members of the TV crew have access to the hole card images during the taping. Although during the broadcast commentators may appear to be present at the venue, their commentary is most often added after play is complete when they have the opportunity to view the hole-cam video. Prior to the invention of the hole-card camera, the audience had no way of knowing what the players were holding during any given hand of a poker broadcast unless players chose to show their cards or were all in. Some televised tournaments also have a camera in the dealer's position to record the turn and river cards when a player wins the pot on the flop or turn. The viewers get to see what would have happened had there been a call, adding an extra element of drama. The players commonly call this the rabbit cam, although different poker shows use their own names for marketing purposes. The name derives from the poker term rabbit hunting, which means to look at the next few cards after a hand is over. Rabbit hunting is generally against tournament rules, partially because it gives away information. Consequently, this extra camera is used so the dealer can show the camera only and not the players at the table. Henry Orenstein was granted a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the under-the-table hole-card camera on September 19, 1995.

It is essentially refined rabbit collagen, and was originally used as an ingredient in traditional gesso. History In traditional oil painting as practiced by the Renaissance painter, skin glue was used to seal the canvas. This is necessary because the linseed oil that forms the base of most oil paint contains linolenic acid that will destroy the canvas fibers over time. Renaissance artists also knew that pure size (hide glue) became brittle once dry, and would mix it with oil and chalk to make a \\"half-ground\\" for canvases. Pure hide glue was usually applied only to rigid supports like panels. Though this does help to seal the canvas or panel, artists still applied a layer of \\"oil ground\\" which was often lead based paint in order to provide a binding layer for the final oil paint to adhere to. The primary purpose of Rabbit-skin glue was to protect and seal the canvas. Production Rabbit skin glue is an animal glue created by prolonged boiling of animal connective tissue. Rabbit skin glue can be bought in powder form or in larger chunks. Preparation involves using the correct proportion of water to glue to achieve the correct consistency and strength. It should be heated to just short of the boiling point. Too much heat results in a product with reduced adhesive qualities. Manufacturers of rabbit, and cow & horse hide glue recommend dissolving at . Uses=Adhesive As an adhesive, Rabbit-skin glue is used in the production of the bellows of concertinas, and in other smaller, light instruments‚Äîprominently in violins. Its supreme advantages are very fast bonding; and easy debonding with hot water if an instrument must be disassembled for internal repairs. It also has very low creep, which is the tendency of some glues to plastically yield under even low but consistent stresses over time. For example, guitar bridges are subject to high lateral stresses that with the wrong glue can lead it to creep forward. The proteins of the glue soak into the wood and interlace with its pores. Setting of the glue occurs with cooling and drying, so the working time is very short, on the order of minutes, to stick the parts together and get full strength, unlike PVA glue which might provide 20‚Äì30 minutes. Furthermore, since the glue only works by microscopically stitching the wood fibers together, any gaps in the joint are not going to be successfully filled, and so the mating surface must be very smooth. Sizing When used in painting as a sizing, it is spread thoroughly over a canvas that has been placed on the stretcher. When the glue dries, it tightens the canvas. After this has been allowed to dry, an oil- based primer is then applied. A canvas sized with rabbit-skin glue can be made tighter than with other alternatives--such as an acrylic-based gesso--because of the shrinkage. This type of canvas is also valuable because it can be sanded to a flatter texture, which allows the painter to achieve a finer level of detail than can be achieved with a typical acrylic gesso ground. This rabbit-skin glue ground is only appropriate for use under oil paint. Acrylic- based media will flake off a canvas prepared with rabbit-skin glue and are therefore not appropriate. Rabbit skin glue is considered to be a major cause of cracking in oil paintings by most modern conservators. Because the glue is hygroscopic, it continually absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, causing the glue to swell and shrink as ambient humidity levels change. Over many humidity cycles, this repeated flexing causes the brittle oil paint to crack. Modern substitutes for rabbit skin glue are available, such as Gamblin‚Äôs PVA size and Golden Acrylics‚Äô GAC100. These substitutes do not have the hygroscopic properties of rabbit skin glue, while still being very slightly hygroscopic, and should not cause the damage to oil paints that rabbit skin glue does. However, these modern replacements do not stiffen and tighten the canvas as well as rabbit skin glue does, so some artists still prefer to use rabbit skin glue.

It took place on the site of the present day Lebanese city of Tripoli, in the aftermath of the First Crusade. It led to the establishment of the fourth crusader state, the County of Tripoli. Background After the capture of Antioch (June 1098) and the destruction of Ma'arrat al-Numan (January 13, 1099), the Syrian emirs were terrified of the advancing crusaders and quickly handed over their cities to the Franks. On January 14, Sultan ibn Munqidh, emir of Shaizar, dispatched an embassy to Raymond IV of Toulouse, one of the leaders of the crusade, to offer provisions and food for men and horses, as well as guides to Jerusalem. In February, the emir of Homs, Janah ad-Dawla, who had fought bravely at the siege of Antioch, offered horses to Raymond. The qadi of Tripoli, Jalal al- Mulk, from the Banu Ammar, sent rich gifts and invited the Franks to send an embassy to his city. The ambassadors marvelled at the splendors of the city, and an alliance was concluded. The crusades moved on to Arqa, which they besieged from February 14 to May 13, before continuing south to Jerusalem; they did not attack Tripoli or any other possessions of the Banu Ammar. Raymond returns to Tripoli The Siege of Jerusalem was a success and led to the foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Most crusaders returned home afterwards; a second movement set out, encouraged by the success of the First Crusade, but it was mostly annihilated by the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia. Raymond participated in this crusade as well, and returned to Syria after escaping from his defeat at the hands of Kilij Arslan I in Anatolia. He had with him only three hundred men. Fakhr al-Mulk, qadi of Tripoli, was not as accommodating to Raymond as his predecessor had been, and called for assistance from Duqaq of Damascus and the governor of Homs. However, the troops from Damascus and Homs defected once they reached Tripoli, and the qadi was defeated at the beginning of April, losing seven thousand men. Raymond could not take Tripoli itself, but captured Tortosa, which became the base of all future operations against Tripoli. The Siege The following year, Raymond, with the aid of Byzantine engineers, constructed Mons Peregrinus, \\"Pilgrim's mountain\\" or \\"Qalaat Saint-Gilles\\" (\\"fortress of Saint-Gilles\\"), in order to block Tripoli's access inland. With the Genoese Hugh Embriaco, Raymond also seized Gibelet. After the Battle of Harran in 1104, Fakhr al-Mulk asked Sokman, the former Ortoqid governor of Jerusalem, to intervene; Sokman marched into Syria but was forced to return home. Fakhr al-Mulk then attacked Mons Peregrinus in September, 1104, killing many of the Franks and burning down one wing of the fortress. Raymond himself was badly wounded, and died five months later in February, 1105. He was replaced as leader by his nephew William-Jordan, count of Cerdanya. On his deathbed, Raymond had reached an agreement with the qadi: if he would stop attacking the fortress, the crusaders would stop impeding Tripolitanian trade and merchandise. The qadi accepted. In 1108, it became more and more difficult to bring food to the besieged by land. Many citizens sought to flee to Homs, Tyre, and Damascus. The nobles of the city, who had betrayed the city to the Franks by showing them how it was being resupplied with food, were executed in the crusader camp. Fakhr al-Mulk, left to wait for help from the Seljuk sultan Mehmed I, went to Baghdad at the end of March with five hundred troops and many gifts. He passed through Damascus, now governed by Toghtegin after the death of Duqaq, and was welcomed with open arms. In Baghdad, the sultan received him with great spectacle, but had no time for Tripoli while there was a succession dispute in Mosul. Fakhr al-Mulk returned to Damascus in August, where he learned Tripoli had been handed over to al-Afdal Shahanshah, vizier of Egypt, by the nobles, who were tired of waiting for him to return. The next year, the Franks gathered in force outside Tripoli, led by Baldwin I of Jerusalem, Baldwin II of Edessa, Tancred, regent of Antioch, William-Jordan, and Raymond IV's eldest son Bertrand of Toulouse, who had recently arrived with fresh Genoan, Pisan and Proven√ßal troops. Tripoli waited in vain for reinforcements from Egypt. A compromise decided in the course of a dispute beneath the walls of the city, and arbitrated by Baldwin of Jerusalem, allowed the city to be captured: the County of Tripoli would be divided between the two claimants, William-Jordan, as a vassal of the Principality of Antioch, and Bertrand, as a vassal of Jerusalem. The city crumbled on July 12, and was sacked by the crusaders. One hundred thousand volumes of the Dar-em-Ilm library were deemed \\"impious\\" and burned. The Egyptian fleet arrived eight hours too late. Most of the inhabitants were enslaved, the others were deprived of their possessions and expelled. Bertrand, Raymond IV's illegitimate son, had William-Jordan assassinated in 1110 and claimed two-thirds of the city for himself, with the other third falling to the Genoans. Thus Tripoli became a crusader state; the rest of the Mediterranean coast had already fallen to the crusaders or would pass to them within the next few years, with the capture of Sidon in 1110 and Tyre in 1124.

Located at 1154 Gilford Street on English Bay near Stanley Park. Constructed in 1912, the Sylvia was designed as an apartment building by Mr. W.P. White, a Seattle architect. It was built by Booker, Campbell and Whipple Construction Company for a Mr. Goldstein, who had a daughter named Sylvia. During the Depression the Sylvia Court Apartments fell on hard times, and in 1936 the building was converted into an apartment hotel. With the advent of World War II, many of the suites were converted to rooms, to provide accommodation for crews of the merchant marine. After the war the number of permanent residents in the hotel gradually decreased, until by the sixties the Sylvia had become a completely transient full-service hotel. In 1954 it opened the first cocktail bar in Vancouver. Until 1958 the Sylvia Hotel was the tallest building in the West End ‚Äì a well-known landmark, its brick and terracotta extension softened by the Virginia creeper that now completely covers the Gilford Street side of the hotel. Until superseded by the West-End building boom of the 1960s, the hotel restaurant's slogan was \\"Dine in the Sky\\". In 1975 the Sylvia was designated by the City of Vancouver as a \\"heritage building\\", thereby ensuring its survival for many years to come. The famous Sylvia Hotel cat, \\"Mr. Got To Go\\", has inspired three popular children's books by Lois Simmie and illustrated by Cynthia Nugent. They are engaging tales of the stray cat who arrived at the Sylvia Hotel one day, took control of the premises and decided to check in permanently. A feline resident ‚Äì possibly the same cat ‚Äì is mentioned in a song about the hotel by American folk singer-songwriter Cheryl Wheeler. Sylvia Ablowitz Sylvia Goldstein, (later Ablowitz) spent her childhood in the West End. A strong swimmer, she sometimes practised in English Bay and once won a race between the bay and Kitsilano Beach. (Later, she would attract the attention of her future husband, Harry Ablowitz, by diving into False Creek from a boat carrying Jewish singles on an outing.) After Sylvia completed a degree at the University of British Columbia, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she worked for a labour union. She returned to Vancouver in 1928, and met Harry, marrying him within a year and settling in North Vancouver. Together, they founded a realty company. Sylvia and her husband were very committed to Jewish seniors. Sylvia worked with Jewish community groups, and she and Harry helped set up a rest home and hospital, now in operation for nearly 60 years. In her 90s, Sylvia was still volunteering for a telephone home-check program to help out other senior Jews. She died on April 12, 2002 at the University of British Columbia Hospital.

It comprises approximately of carefully kept woodlands, streams, dramatic cliff faces, flower gardens, and the James Barry bandshell and picnic spots, as well as its showpiece, Mirror Lake. The park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Most of the land was given to the town by Walter Hubbard, president of the Bradley & Hubbard Manufacturing Company. In his donation, the land was given outright, with the stipulation that everything connected with the park was to remain free of charge for the people of Meriden, and that no concessions for profit were ever allowed within the park area. Hubbard spent a great deal of time and energy creating the park. He personally spent between $400,000 and $500,000 to clear land, build roads, and construct Mirror Lake with the help of Frederick Law Olmsted, who is best known for designing New York City's Central Park.

From the top of Castle Craig it is possible to see most of the Quinnipiac Valley region, Long Island Sound, and the distant higher peaks of southern New England. East Peak is often cited as the highest mountain within of the coastline from Cadillac Mountain in Maine to Florida, however, nearby West Peak is higher. Castle Craig The park also features a bandshell and flower gardens and is the site of a variety of local festivals and concerts, most notably the spring Daffodil Festival. Castle Craig is open to the public in season. A park road (open from May through October from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) traverses the park. The Daffodil Festival began in 1978 as a way for the community to come together in the springtime. Held every last weekend in April, the festival is celebrated with food, a parade, fireworks, and of course daffodils. The park is filled with these yellow flowers as the number continues to rise. Hubbard Park is transformed with a craft area with booths from different artists, food tent with live music, and games and rides. Shuttle busses are available throughout Meriden including Platt High School, Wilcox Technical School, the Westfield Mall, and downtown Meriden HUB. The Daffodil Festival is free admission for all.

There are over 300 lighted displays throughout the park and over half a million lights are used. The lights include many forest animals, alligators, camels, the globe, a Christmas tree, and hanging snowflakes. Cars can travel through the park and be mesmerized by the beauty of the night and lights.  Geology  The Hanging Hills of Meriden are part of the Metacomet Ridge, which is nearly continuous from Belchertown, Massachusetts to Branford, Connecticut. The hanging Hills were formed by volcanic activity 200 million years ago during the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia. Two major lava flows covered the red sandstone valley in Meriden. Each cooled and hardened into trap rock (also known as basalt) and was gradually covered by sand and mud which eroded from the surrounding hills. Once the volcanic activity stopped, the whole region fractured and tilted to the west. Since then, hundreds of feet of the softer sandstone bedrock have eroded from the valley, leaving the dense, hard volcanic trap rock ridge layers standing out far above the surrounding landscape.

It once had over 30 temples, most of which now lay buried in sand. The extant group of temples, where the eastward flowing Kaveri river changes course as the sand on its banks spreads over a wide area, is a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus. History Close up view of the shrine and mantapa (hall) outer wall at Vaidyeshvara temple The origin of the town is lost in antiquity; but one tradition is that its name was derived from two KirƒÅta twin brothers, Tala and KƒÅdu, who, cutting down a tree which they saw wild elephants worshiping, discovered that it contained an image of shiva, and that the elephants were rishis transformed. The tree being miraculously restored, all obtained m≈çksha and the place was named Tala-kƒÅdu, which was translated into Sanskrit as Dala-vana. Two stone images declared to represent the brothers are pointed out in front of the temple Veerabadra swamy. In a later age, RƒÅma is said to have halted here on his expedition to Lanka. The earliest authentic mention of the city of TalekƒÅd or TalakƒÅdu, in Sanskrit Dalavana-pura, is in connection with the Ganga line of kings. Harivarma, who has been assigned to find a place (247-266 A.D) was, according to an old chronicle, installed at Skandapura (said to be Gajalhatti, in the Coimbatore country, near where the MoyƒÅr flows into the BhavƒÅni), but resided in the great city of Dalavanapura in the KarnƒÅta-dƒìsa. Thenceforward TalkƒÅd became the capital these powerful sovereigns and there the subsequent kings of that line were crowned. At the beginning of the 11th century, the Western Gangas succumbed to the Ch≈çlas, who captured TalkƒÅd and gave it the name of RƒÅjarƒÅjapura. But about a hundred years later it was taken by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, who drove the Ch≈çlas out of Mysore. After this time we find that TalkƒÅd was composed of seven towns and five mathas or monastic establishments. The town of MƒÅyilangi or Malingi, on the opposite side of the river, was also a large place, and had the name of JananƒÅthapura. Down to the middle of the 14th century, it remained a possession of the Hoysalas, and then passed into the hands of a feudatory of the Vijayanagar sovereigns, whose line appears to be known as that of S≈çma-RƒÅja.  Curse of Talakadu  In 1610 it was conquered by the Mysore RƒÅja under the following circumstances. Tirumala- RƒÅja, sometimes called Srƒ´ Ranga RƒÅya, the representative of the Vijayanagar family at Seringapatam (Srirangapatna), being afflicted with an incurable disease, came to TalkƒÅd for the purpose of offering sacrifices in the temple of Vaidyƒìsvara. His second wife Alamelamma was left in charge of the Government of Srirangagapattanam, but she, hearing he was on the point of death, soon after left for TalkƒÅd with the object of seeing him before he died, handing over Srirangapattanam and its dependencies to RƒÅja Wodeyar of Mysore, whose dynasty ever since retained them. It appears that RƒÅja Wodeyar had been desirous of possessing the jewels which was the property of the RƒÅni, and being unable to obtain them, and eager to seize at any pretext, he levied an army and proceeded against the Rani. RƒÅni Alamelamma thereupon went to the banks of the Cauvery, and throwing in the jewel, drowned herself opposite MƒÅlangi, at the same time uttering a three-fold curse,-\\"Let TalakƒÅd become sand ; let MƒÅlangi become a whirlpool ; let the Mysore RƒÅjas fail to beget heirs.\\" The latter part continues to affect the royal family. Talakadu is also tagged to the curse called \\"Curse of Talakadu\\" by Alamelamma on the Wodeyar dynasty (erstwhile Maharajas) of Mysore.The Curse of Talakadu- A Legend in History by Sashi Sivaramakrishna ; , Published by Roopa & Co is a recent welcome addition on this subject which has been seldom written about. The Talakadu curse has established itself in the folklore as a miracle since the early part of the 16th century because of two strange events visible even to date: (i) Talakadu, a historically vibrant city, is now being submerged under sand dunes several meters deep, and (ii) the Mysore royal family have faced a problem of having a rightful heir to the throne since the 17th century. Both these events linked to an apparent curse by a pious lady (Alamelamma) have defied logic. Based on the data from diverse sources and field studies, K. N. Ganeshaiah has reconstructed the possible chronology of events of this acclaimed miracle. Ganeshaiah argues that the Talakadu phenomenon represents an ecological disaster unintentionally wrought on to a vibrant civilization at this place. In this sense, the curse per se is an intelligently inserted story set as an overlay. Using the example, Ganeshaiah discusses the possible process through which the miracles or myths of this kind survive in a society. The curse of Talakadu - \\"Talakadu Maralagi, Malangi Maduvagi, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalagadirali\\"- the female Alamelamma cursed this way. (translation- \\")May Talakadu become sandy, Malangi become a whirlpool and Mysore Kings will not have children\\") The following is what is known as the curse of TalkƒÅd, in the original:- > TalkƒÅdu MaralaƒÅgi. > MƒÅlingi maduvaƒÅgi > Mysuru dhorege makkalagade h≈çgali. > (‡≤§‡≤≤‡≤ï‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥Å ‡≤Æ‡≤∞‡≤≥‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤ø; ‡≤Æ‡≤æ‡≤≤‡≤ø‡≤Ç‡≤ó‡≤ø ‡≤Æ‡≤°‡≥Å‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤ø, ‡≤Æ‡≥à‡≤∏‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤¶‡≥ä‡≤∞‡≥Ü‡≤ó‡≥Ü ‡≤Æ‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≤≥‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤¶‡≥Ü ‡≤π‡≥ã‡≤ó‡≤≤‡≤ø!) The old city TalkƒÅd is completely buried beneath the hills of sand stretching for nearly a mile in length, only the tops of two gopurams being visible. The sand hills used to advance upon the town at the rate of 9 or 10 feet a year, principally during the south-west monsoon and as they pressed it close on three sides. The inhabitants of TalkƒÅd were constantly forced to abandon their houses and retreat further inland. The town, however, is increasing in population, owing to the rich wet cultivation in the neighbourhood, derived from the MƒÅdhavamantri anicut and channel. More than thirty temples, it is stated, are beneath the sand, but the K√≠rti NƒÅrƒÅyana temple has been successfully excavated. The most imposing temple left uncovered by the sand is that of Vydyanatheshwara temple. In the early part of the last century two temples ƒÄnandƒìsvara and Gaurisankara, were unearthed. Four fragmentary records were found on the outer walls of the PƒÅtƒÅlƒìsvara temple. One of these is an old inscription in Kannada of the Ganga period, the others being in Tamil. The ƒÄnandƒìsvara temple is said to have been built by one ChidƒÅnandasvƒÅmi, a contemporary of Haidar. A story is related to that of the SvƒÅmi that he once crossed the Cauvery in full flood seated on a plantain leaf and that Haidar who witnessed the miracle greatly honoured him and made a grant of land for the temple founded by him. A Kannada inscription at the Gaurisankara temple tells us that this temple was built during the reign of the Mysore king Chikka-Dƒìva-RƒÅja-Wodeyar (1672‚Äì1704). The Hoysala ruler, Vishnuvardhana, conquered the Gangas and Talakadu. He built the impressive Vijayanarayana Chennakesava Temple at Belur.  Some other legends  Several other interesting legends also surround this shrine. It is believed that an ascetic Somadatta headed out to Siddharanya Kshetra Talakadu to worship Shiva. Having been killed by wild elephants en route, he and his disciples re-incarnated as wild elephants and worshipped Shiva in the form of a tree at Talakadu. Two hunters Tala and Kada, are believed to have struck the tree with an axe to find blood gushing forth, and upon the bidding of a heavenly voice, dressed the wound of the tree with the tree's leaves and fruits. The tree healed, and the hunters became immortal. Since Shiva is believed to have healed himself through this incident, he is referred to as Vaidyeshwara. The Panchalingas here are all associated with this legend. Talakadu Today A view of Talkad This sleepy little town is at the epicenter of some of the latest advances in horticulture and wine making. Often referred to as Bangalore's Gourmet Valley by name Cauvery Valley, it is still a secret many chefs choose not to share. Fine wines, exotic Zero Pesticide fresh produce, artisan cheese and diverse culinary experiences are changing this once sleepy hamlet. Many eco- sustainable resorts like Chukkimane have been offering a pleasant weekend stay near to Talakadu. Temples At Talakadu sand covers the temples. Stone pillars, square at the base and made to fit into a wheel below the abacus, lie scattered about. Among the temples of Talakadu, the Pathaleshwara, Maruleshwara, Arkeshwara, Vaidyanatheshwara and Mallikarjuna temples, the five Lingas believed to represent the five faces of Shiva, form the Pancha pathi and have become famous. In honour of these five Shiva temples, a fair is held once every 12 years called Panchalinga Darshana, last held in 2009. The Panchalinga Darshana is held on a new moon day in the month of Karthika when two stars conjoin, the stars of Khuha Yoga and Vishaka. On this day, tradition has it that pilgrims should first bathe in the Gokarna theertha, worship Gokarneswara and Chandikadevi, and then worship Vaidyeshwara, and then bathe in the northern eastern southern and western stretches of the Kaveri and then worship Arkeshwara, Pataleshwara, Maraleshwara and Mallikarjuna, returning to Vaidyeshwara after each worship, finally worship Kirtinarayana and conclude the pilgrimage in one day.Talakad According to local legend, Ramanujacharya during his sojourn in Karnataka (also called Melnadu), established five Vishnu temples of Lord Narayana known as Pancha Narayana Kshetrams. Talakadu is one of the Pancha Narayana Kshetrams where the Keerthi Narayana temple was established and the presiding Deity in this temple is Keerthi Narayana.

Raised in a working-class family, he was introduced to esoteric ideas by his mother and grandmother from a young age, and as a young man began working as a medium in the local Spiritualist Churches before going on to study and practice ceremonial magic. In 1963, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca before founding his own coven, through which he merged many aspects of ceremonial magic into Wicca. He claimed to have been initiated by his Grandmother as a child, though evidence for this is lacking. Throughout the 1960s, he would court publicity in the press, appearing in a number of documentaries, marrying the far younger Maxine Sanders, and being declared to be the \\"King of the Witches\\" by his followers, something that led to other prominent Gardnerian Witches, such as Patricia Crowther and Eleanor Bone, attacking him in the press. In the late 1970s and 1980s, he went on to work with a ceremonial magical group known as the Ordine Della Luna, prior to his death. The tradition he founded with Maxine Sanders became known as Alexandrian Wicca. Early life Born Orrell Alexander Carter, on 6 June 1926, at St. Catherine's Hospital (56 Church Rd, Tranmere, Birkenhead),\\"A Talk by Maxine Sanders\\" part 1, Witchcraft and Wicca Issue 3, p. 4. London: Children of Artemis. he was the oldest of six surviving children. His father was Orrell Alexander Carter - allegedly a dance-hall entertainer who suffered from alcoholism - while his mother was a domestic servant, Hannah Jane Bibby. Later the family, who had been living at the home of his paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Carter (n√©e Gandy), of 1 Moon St, Birkenhead, moved to Cornbrook Street,Old Trafford[Manchester] and unofficially changed their name to Sanders; Sanders was unaware of his official surname until he applied for a passport later in life, and only changed his name by deed poll in the 1960s. He and his siblings Joan (born 1928) and Thomas(1929) ‚Äì were registered under the name Carter in Birkenhead, then sister Patricia (1933),John R (1934), and David (1937) ‚Äì the last three registered as Sanders in Barton, Manchester. Initiation into witchcraft Several contradictory accounts have been given of Sanders' initiation into witchcraft, and even his own accounts are inconsistent. The most famous version is that given in his biography, King of the Witches, by June Johns: Sanders had tuberculosis as a child and regularly visited his grandmother, Mary Bibby, a cunning woman in Wales for the fresh air. According to Sanders this was the beginning of his magical education: Regaining her composure, she told Sanders to step into the circle, take off his clothes, and put his head between his thighs. As he did so, she took a sickle-knife and nicked his scrotum, saying, \\"You are one of us now.\\" (This was later revealed to be false and Sanders was merely furthering his publicity) It was then that Sanders realised she was a witch.Cavendish, Richard (1970). \\"Alex Sanders\\", Man, Myth and Magic. . His Grandmother was a hereditary witch, a descendant of the Welsh chieftain Owain Glynd≈µr, the last man (according to Sanders) to have called himself \\"King of the Witches\\"; supposedly his grandmother let him copy her Book of Shadows when he was nine and taught him the rites and magic of Witches. He was taught clairvoyance first by scrying in inky water, then in his grandmother's crystal. Sanders claimed that following the Blitz, and a few months before her death at age 74, Mrs Bibby conferred upon him second- and third-grade initiations, involving ritual sex. Gardnerian High Priestess Patricia Crowther tells a different story. According to letters she claims she received from him in 1961, he did not then claim to be an initiate, but felt an affinity with the occult and had experienced second sight. In a 1962 interview Sanders claimed to have been initiated for a year, working in a coven led by a woman from Nottingham. This claim is corroborated by Maxine Sanders, Sanders' future wife and High Priestess. (See Wicca below) Maxine Sanders also maintained that although Sanders was later initiated into Wicca, he was indeed taught a form of witchcraft by his grandmother when he was young. She describes Mrs Bibby as an austere lady, wise in folklore, who taught her grandson magic with his mother's knowledge and permission; all of Sanders' brothers were also psychic, she says: When Sanders publicly revealed himself as a witch, however, Mrs. Sanders feigned shock and threatened a nervous breakdown. According to Maxine Sanders, Sanders also worked for a while as a healer in Spiritualist Churches under the pseudonym Paul Dallas; a famous medium called Edwards discovered him and his brothers and wanted them to do a stage show, however they refused, believing their clairvoyance, healing and mediumship to be divine gifts not to be misused. First marriage Towards the end of the war he began working for a manufacturing chemist's laboratory in Manchester. He married a co-worker, nineteen-year-old Doreen Stretton, in 1948 when he was 22, using the name Alexander O Sanders. They had two children, Paul and Janice. Sanders wanted more children but Doreen didn't; she also disapproved of the supernatural. The marriage quickly deteriorated and Doreen took the children and left Sanders when he was 26. According to Maxine Sanders, Sanders was grief-stricken and cursed Doreen with fertility; she remarried and had three sets of twins. It was also while working in a pharmaceutical company that he became friends with Maxine Sanders's mother, however they lost contact for a while, probably due to the \\"intense dislike\\" that her father had for him (being convinced Alex was homosexual). Left hand path After the Second World War and his separation from Doreen and the children, Sanders felt isolated by his occult knowledge, and decided to live a life of the \\"left hand path\\" after having drifted from one low-level job to another and had sexual affairs with both men and women. During this period he also studied the works of Abramelin. Apparently angels told him to seek employment in 1963 as a porter, book-duster and odd-job man in the John Rylands Library, Manchester, where he could access an original copy of the Key of Solomon. Within weeks an allegation that he had defecated in the library basement led to the discovery that he had damaged a late 19th century edition of the S.L Mathers translation of the 'Key of Solomon' by ripping out the plates and taking them home. According to his own admission he dismantled this book and borrowed it a few pages at a time for copying; discovery of this nearly led to Sanders' prosecution but the librarians allowed him an amnesty on condition that the materials were safely returned, after which he was dismissed without charges being brought against him. As well as this influence from Goetia which he incorporated into his version of Wicca, Sanders was greatly influenced by the teachings of Eliphas Levi. Wicca Sanders' first contact with Wicca was in the early 1960s, through correspondence and meetings with Patricia Crowther. In September 1962, he succeeded in convincing the Manchester Evening News to run a front-page article on Wicca. This publicity had several unfortunate side-effects for Sanders, including the loss of his job at the library and estrangement from the Crowthers, who considered him a troublesome upstart and refused to initiate him. He was eventually initiated by a priestess who had been a member of the Crowthers' coven, and with whom Maxine Sanders later worked for several years. It was rumoured that Sanders copied the Wiccan Book of Shadows in a Gardnerian's garage while a party was going on in the house, however according to Maxine Sanders he copied his book from his initiator's book in the normal manner. Eventually, Sylvia and several others left the group amicably, leaving Sanders to continue as High Priest. During this period the coven worked at Sanders' home at 24 Egerton Road North, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.Eddison, Robert \\"Disciples of the Moon Goddess\\", Weekend Magazine 13 May 1967 Sanders continued to attract media attention which brought him more followers. By 1965 he claimed 1,623 initiates in 100 covens. He proclaimed himself \\"King of the Witches\\". His alleged magical feats included creating familiars; he also claimed to be able to heal warts, illnesses, and physical deformities. Sanders apparently joined other esoteric and chivalric orders beginning in 1968, which numbered 16 in 1974, and possibly more before his death. These included the Knights Templar, the Order of Saint Michael, the Order of Saint George and the Ordine Della Luna (aka the Order of the Romaic Crescent). Births, relationships and the media 15 Clanricarde Gardens, where Alex and Maxine lived in a basement apartment During the 1960s Sanders met Arline Maxine Morris (Maxine Sanders), 20 years his junior, whom he initiated into the Craft and made his high priestess. In 1965 they handfasted, and in 1968 they married in a civil ceremonyProfile of Maxine Sanders at her personal website. Retrieved 6 November 2006. and moved into a basement flat near Notting Hill Gate in London, where they ran their coven and taught classes on Witchcraft. Many followers came to them. Earlier that year their daughter Maya Alexandria was born. Alex Sanders, as a bisexual man, also had a number of relationships with men during his relationship with Maxine.Sanders, Maxine. (2007) Firechild: The Life and Magic of Maxine Sanders Witch Queen. Mandrake of Oxford, Ltd, The projection of Sanders into the national public spotlight resulted from a sensational newspaper article in 1969 which led to the romanticised biography, King of the Witches, by June Johns in 1969, and the film Legend of the Witches (1970). These led to greater publicity, guest appearances on talk-shows, and public speaking engagements. It seemed to other Witches that Sanders was exploiting the Craft and dragging it through the gutter press.Pearson, Joanne. (2007) Wicca and the Christian heritage: ritual, sex and magic, note 4, p114. Abingdon: Routledge, According to Maxine Sanders, Sanders never courted publicity, but was simply unable to avoid it. She describes how Sanders' initial rise to fame came through an attempt to distract media attention away from other witches. The couple running a coven that Sanders belonged to were practising Christians, and the local press had become curious about their activities. Had they been exposed it would have been disastrous for them. Sanders offered the Press an alternative story, proposing to hold a ritual at a magical site at Alderley Edge, where he would raise a man from the dead. A bandaged up figure lying on a stone altar was examined by one of Sanders' colleagues posing as a G.P., who certified it was indeed a corpse. Sanders frequently appeared in ritual photos as robed wearing only a loincloth while witches surrounding him were naked. His explanation for this was that \\"Witch law\\" required that the elder of a coven to be apart from the others and easily identifiable. Sanders met Stewart Farrar at the preview of Legend of the Witches. Farrar was a feature writer for the weekly Reveille working on a story concerning modern Witchcraft. He was interested in Sanders, and at some point during the evening Sanders invited him to an initiation at his coven. Farrar was later initiated by Maxine Sanders into that same coven, where he also met his future wife, Janet Owen; Farrar and Owen formed their own magical partnership and their own coven in 1970 and wrote many books on witchcraft together. Later years The Sanders separated in 1971, Sanders moved to Sussex while Maxine Sanders remained in the London flat where she continued running the coven and teaching the Craft. A son, Victor Mikhael, was born in 1972. Alex and Maxine's strong relationship continued, \\"although it varied in intensity, from a fierce sense of loyalty, blasting curses, to declarations of love until his death in 1988\\".\\"A Talk by Maxine Sanders\\" part 3, Witchcraft and Wicca Issue 5, p. 22. London: Children of Artemis. In 1979 Sanders announced to the witchcraft community that he wished \\"to make amends for some of the past hurts that I have given and many public stupidities I created for others of the Craft\\", and expressed his desire that the Wicca should some day put aside their differences and \\"unite in brotherly love before the face of the Lady and the Lord\\", allowing them to become great again and respected in the outside world.Sanders, O. Alexander (1979). \\"The Many Paths of Wicca\\" in The Cauldron issue 15, Lammas 1979. From 1979 Sanders began working in magical partnership with Derek Taylor, a psychic and trance medium. Together they developed the magical work of Sanders' Order, the Ordine Della Luna in Constantinople which he was chartered to operate as Grand Prior for England and Wales by a contact in London in 1967 who claimed to be a descendant of the Byzantine Palaeologos dynasty but who was actually an eccentric Englishman of Newport on the Isle of Man called Peter Francis Mills.The Ordine Della Luna and Order of Deucalion have entries in .Sanders, O.

The pair were reportedly working with celestial intelligences, disembodied spirits and the demiurge itself. They recorded several journals of channelled notes, including warning of an apocalyptic World War III. Another obscure group which Sanders operated in London during the 1960s was the Order of Deucalion, a focus for Atlantean magical research and inner contacts, as Sanders taught that Merlin was an important leader of the last Atlantean migratory wave into Western Europe. The Order of Deucalion existed as an inner cell of the Ordine Della Luna. Sanders died on May Eve, 1988 after suffering from lung cancer.The Argus, 2 May 1988 At Lammas 1998, ten years after his death, a New England Wiccan coven claimed to have contacted Sanders in spirit. The group alleged that the communications continued until 2003.

Witchcraft with Alex Sanders 1964-72  Raised a Roman Catholic, Maxine was educated at St. Joseph's Convent School in Manchester. In 1964, whilst a student at Loreburn Secretarial College, she first met Alex Sanders. They met through his friendship with her mother who had a range of esoteric interests but their accounts of her introduction to witchcraft vary. Alex's memoir describes her as \\"shy and inexperienced,\\" with her potential being awoken only through her contact with him. Maxine's memoir gives a very different account, describing her experiences of witchcraft as already having been initiated at the age of 15 into a magical lodge in rituals performed in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, England. By the following year, she and at least one other person had been initiated and the coven was up and running. Maxine was quickly taken through the system of three degrees and by the age of 18 was a third degree Witch Queen although one source suggests that at that time her role was a somewhat passive one. It was said that at Alex's lectures all Maxine had to do was to \\"sit there in her finery.\\" It is alleged that Alex said, \\"All I want you to do is sit there and look beautiful and represent the Goddess.\\" Maxine's early career as a witch was not free from difficulties. In 1965, a midsummer ritual was attended by a newspaper photographer, unbeknown to some of those present, Maxine included. The subsequent report in a local newspaper published recognisable photographs of her and she was thus \\"outed\\" as a witch without her permission. Maxine's unconventional spiritual path led to strife with her mother, who she was reconciled with close before her death. Soon after Maxine's mother's death members of her mother's neighborhood chased Maxine, throwing stones, and the windows of the house which had been her mother's were smashed. Maxine and Alex were handfasted at Alderley Edge in 1965 and continued to initiate new witches in Manchester. In 1967, they moved to London where they lived and practised witchcraft in a basement flat in Notting Hill Gate, attracting much publicity and initiating many would-be priests and priestesses. At Beltane 1968, the couple married in a civil ceremony in Kensington London. Alex and Maxine had two children: Maya, born in 1967, and Victor, born in 1972. Over the next few years until 1972, Maxine and Alex trained and initiated new members of their coven, initially within a framework consistent with older traditions but subsequently incorporating more of the couple's own unique characteristics, preferences, and innovations. In 1971, Stewart Farrar, recently initiated by Maxine, gave their brand of witchcraft the new name of \\"Alexandrian\\", partly honouring its leaders and also referencing the greatest city of the Hellenistic world and the library of magical texts which it housed, the library of Alexandria. In 1971, Alex and Maxine had acquired a second home outside of London in the village of Selmeston, Sussex. There Maxine became a \\"fanatical gardener\\" while she and Alex set up a second coven and started to train people locally. Maxine, however, became concerned that the standards and expectations of training were not so high as they once had been in London, and that there was an awkward atmosphere. The couple found the cost of running two homes was too much, and they returned to London in 1972. Maxine declared that she no longer wanted to bear the responsibilities that came with the title \\"Witch Queen\\" and ritually destroyed the ritual robes and other items she had acquired. Shortly thereafter, Alex moved back to Sussex, and Maxine remained in London with their children.  Alexandrian Witchcraft  From early 1970 onwards, both Alex and Maxine gained media attention due to their openness about practising witchcraft, appearing in a number of films, such as 'Legend of the Witches' (1970), 'Witchcraft ‚Äô70' (1970), 'Secret Rites' (1971), and numerous documentaries. After Maxine and Alex separated, Maxine remained in their London flat where she ran her own coven, \\"The Temple of the Mother\\", continuing to initiate and train people in Alexandrian Witchcraft. Members of the Temple of the Mother also trained in the art of healing and became well respected for it and other charitable works in the community. Maxine remained in close contact with Alex until his death in 1988 and shortly before his death, he named Maxine as his next of kin.A C Towner Ltd (funeral directors) handwritten entry in Volume dated 16 June '86 - 9 Nov '88.Hastings Cemetery and Crematorium, Register of Cremations, Volume 19, Cremation Record 47733 In 2000, Maxine moved to Snowdonia, Wales, until 2010, but returned to Abbey Road, London.

The roller coaster had originally debuted in 1990 as a stand-up roller coaster named Iron Wolf at Six Flags Great America. It was later relocated to Six Flags America in 2012 and renamed Apocalypse, under which it operated until 2018. The roller coaster was the first to be built by Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard. When known as Iron Wolf, the roller coaster briefly held world records among stand-up roller coasters for height () and speed () before being surpassed several years later. History=Six Flags Great America (1990‚Äì2011) On April 28, 1990, Apocalypse opened as Iron Wolf at Six Flags Great America on the former site of Z-Force (the only Intamin Space Diver ever manufactured). At its debut in 1990, it was the tallest and fastest stand-up roller coaster in the world until 1992 when TOGO built Milky Way which stands at and 1996 when Bolliger & Mabillard built Mantis at Cedar Point which has a top speed of . In 1994, Iron Wolf appeared in the movie Richie Rich as Richie's backyard roller coaster. On August 5, 2011, Six Flags Great America announced on their official Facebook page that the Iron Wolf would be closed on September 5, 2011: \\"After a long 21 year history at the park, we will be removing Iron Wolf. Make sure to get your last rides in ‚Äì Iron Wolf‚Äôs Last Stand is September 5\\". 'The Last Stand' is also a reference to the slogan afforded to Apocalypse. Iron Wolf's former site would be taken over in 2014 by a custom RMC wooden roller coaster. Six Flags America (2012‚Äìpresent)Apocalypse (2012‚Äì18)= On August 22, 2011, Six Flags America announced on their Facebook page that they would be adding a new attraction in 2012. From this day, the park began to slowly remove burnt pieces from an envelope each days leading up to the official announcement on September 1, 2011. On September 1, 2011, Six Flags America announced that they would be adding Apocalypse in 2012. Iron Wolf closed on September 5, 2011, and work began on preparing it for transport to its new location. The new owners planned to add the roller coaster to the Skull Island section of their park, but before the relocation could take place, the Skull Mountain ride at Six Flags America had to be closed and demolished to make room for the new attraction. Construction for the coaster continued until the end of March 2012 when the final piece of track was installed. The official Facebook page for Six Flags America had stated that the ride would officially open on May 25, 2012, but this was later changed to June 7, 2012. =Firebird (2019‚Äìpresent)= On August 16, 2018, the park announced on their social media platforms that Apocalypse would close on September 8, 2018. On August 30, 2018, instead of being demolished or relocated, it was announced that Apocalypse would be converted into a floorless coaster and renamed Firebird for the 2019 season. It is the third Bolliger & Mabillard stand-up coaster to be converted into a floorless coaster, after Cedar Point's Rougarou (previously known as Mantis) and California's Great America's Patriot (previously known as Vortex). Firebird opened on May 3, 2019 to Six Flag members with a Platinum membership or higher. It opened to the public on May 17th. Meanwhile, the former Apocalypse train was being donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. Ride experience After departing the station, the train makes a 180 degree turn leading to the chain lift hill. Once at the top, the train goes through a pre-drop before making a sharp left hand turn leading into the first drop. Once the train is at the bottom of the first drop, it immediately goes through the first of two inversions, a vertical loop. The train then makes an upward right turn before making a left turn back down to the ground. The train continues to go left before going through an upward helix. After, the train makes a downward right s-bend leading into the second and final inversion, a corkscrew. The train makes a left turn back up before going through another s-bend, small over-banked turn which leads to the brake run. One cycle lasts about 2 minutes with riders reaching a top speed of . Trains Firebird operates with two floorless trains. Each train has six rows with four each for a total of 24 riders per train. When the roller coaster was known as Iron Wolf, both trains featured the face of a wolf on the front of the train. After the ride was relocated to Six Flags America, the wolf was removed and the word \\"Apocalypse\\" replaced it. Track The steel track is approximately in length and the height of the lift is approximately . The first drop is . The track spine is painted orange and the rails red. The supports are dark gray. When the coaster was known as Iron Wolf at Six Flags Great America, the track was brown. Theme Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse was known as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its relocation to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an end of the world apocalypse theme was added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests went further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimicked an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride. After being converted to Firebird, much of the Apocalypse theming has been removed. The fire effect is still used, however.

It consists of a central library, 29 branch libraries (as of the fall of 2017), and a library portal. SAPL was awarded the National Medal for Museum and Library Service in 2006. In 2003, SAPL celebrated its centennial. New patrons received special centennial gold library cards instead of the usual purple cards. Central Library Central Library Northeastern fa√ßade The Central Library is a , six-story structure that opened in 1995 in Downtown San Antonio. It is easily recognized by its bright-colored, striking \\"Mexican Modernist\\" design. The primary color of the building's exterior is popularly referred to by San Antonians as \\"Enchilada Red.\\" The architect for the building was selected by a design competition held by the city in July 1991. The winning design is by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta in partnership with Sprinkle Robey Architects and Johnson- Dempsey & Associates of San Antonio. Unique features of the library include a multi-story, bright yellow atrium and several outdoor plazas with landscaping and fountains intended to be used as outdoor reading rooms. In Legorreta's own words: \\"I wanted to break the concept that libraries are imposing.\\" The library was financed through a $28 million bond to build a new Central Library. The bonds were approved by San Antonio voters in 1989. In addition, another $10 million in funding from private sources and the city's general budget helped finance the murals and artwork inside the library, as well as new furniture, equipment, and fixtures. The centerpiece of the library is a two-story glass blown sculpture named \\"Fiesta Tower\\". It was created by Dale Chihuly in 2003. Since its inauguration in May 1995, the new Central Library attracted a great deal of attention in architectural and library circles. After the new facility opened, circulation more than doubled from the previous year. The Central Library currently holds about 580,300 volumes.  Texana and genealogy  The Central library also houses the Texana/Genealogy Department. This department has been a part of the Central library since its opening in 1995 and is located on the sixth floor. The department occupies approximately 10,000 square feet and has * approximately 60,000 microforms * 75,000 books (some of which cannot be removed from the library but can be viewed at the library) * 110 drawers of archival files * 11 map cabinets * extensive archival collections The goal of the collection is to preserve and make available to patrons the history and culture of San Antonio, Bexar County, and Texas. Patrons can come in during Texana operating hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Wednesday, Friday, Saturday or 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM Tuesday and Thursday) to study books and other items in the collection and receive assistance from staff if needed. Note: The Texana/Genealogy Department is a Reference Only Collection. The materials are not allowed to leave the department, however, copies of some of the books are available for check out in the circulating collection.  Latino Collection  The Latino Collection at Central is another great collection maintained and made available to the public. It was established a year after the Central library opened in 1996, and was expanded to become the Latino Collection and Resource center in the Fall of 2017. This expansion allowed the collection to be transferred from the 6th floor of the library to the 1st where more patrons would have exposure and access to it. The 2017 expansion also allowed for space renovation and now there are \\"special spaces that allow the collection to be more meaningful and impactful through programming.\\" The collection is made up of materials in Spanish, and by and about Latinx authors. Items can be checked out for 3 weeks and returned to any branch location with a Variance form. Patrons interested in checking out items would see the reference desk on the 1st floor. Previous buildings Carnegie Library, San Antonio, Texas (postcard, circa 1900-1924) The previous Central Library building at 203 S St. Marys Street was renovated and reopened in 1998. The building, which is located on the River Walk, was renamed the International Center and is primarily used as office space. It houses the City's Department of International Affairs, the San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Trade Commission of Mexico-BancoMext, Casa Tamaulipas, and Casa Nuevo Leonthe as well as the headquarters for the building's primary tenant, the North American Development Bank. The original San Antonio Public Library building, which backs up to the Riverwalk at 210 Market Street, served as the main library from 1930 to 1968, and was from 1968 to 2005 the home of the Hertzberg Circus Museum. In 2006, it was leased to the National Western Art Foundation and underwent renovation to currently house the Dolph and Janie Briscoe Western Art Museum. Branch libraries In addition to the Central Library, SAPL has 29 branch libraries located throughout the San Antonio area. Some branches offer walking trails, fitness stations, and/or playgrounds.

Introduction and history The increasing speed and complexity of today‚Äôs designs implies a significant increase in the power consumption of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. To meet this challenge, researchers have developed many different design techniques to reduce power. The complexity of today‚Äôs ICs, with over 100 million transistors, clocked at over 1 GHz, means manual power optimization would be hopelessly slow and all too likely to contain errors. Computer-aided design (CAD) tools and methodologies are mandatory. One of the key features that led to the success of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, technology was its intrinsic low-power consumption. This meant that circuit designers and electronic design automation (EDA) tools could afford to concentrate on maximizing circuit performance and minimizing circuit area. Another interesting feature of CMOS technology is its nice scaling properties, which has permitted a steady decrease in the feature size (see Moore's law), allowing for more and more complex systems on a single chip, working at higher clock frequencies. Power consumption concerns came into play with the appearance of the first portable electronic systems in the late 1980s. In this market, battery lifetime is a decisive factor for the commercial success of the product. Another fact that became apparent at about the same time was that the increasing integration of more active elements per die area would lead to prohibitively large-energy consumption of an integrated circuit. A high absolute level of power is not only undesirable for economic and environmental reasons, but it also creates the problem of heat dissipation. In order to keep the device working at acceptable temperature levels, excessive heat may require expensive heat removal systems. These factors have contributed to the rise of power as a major design parameter on par with performance and die size. In fact, power consumption is regarded as the limiting factor in the continuing scaling of CMOS technology. To respond to this challenge, in the last decade or so, intensive research has been put into developing computed-aided design (CAD) tools that address the problem of power optimization. Initial efforts were directed to circuit and logic-level tools because at this level CAD tools were more mature and there was a better handle on the issues. Today, most of the research for CAD tools targets system or architectural level optimization, which potentially have a higher overall impact, given the breadth of their application. Together with optimization tools, efficient techniques for power estimation are required, both as an absolute indicator that the circuit‚Äôs consumption meets some target value and as a relative indicator of the power merits of different alternatives during design space exploration. Power analysis of CMOS circuits The power consumption of digital CMOS circuits is generally considered in terms of three components: *The dynamic power component, related to the charging and discharging of the load capacitance at the gate output. *The short-circuit power component. During the transition of the output line (of a CMOS gate) from one voltage level to the other, there is a period of time when both the PMOS and the NMOS transistors are on, thus creating a path from VDD to ground. *The static power component, due to leakage, that is present even when the circuit is not switching. This, in turn, is composed of two components - gate to source leakage, which is leakage directly through the gate insulator, mostly by tunnelling, and source-drain leakage attributed to both tunnelling and sub-threshold conduction. The contribution of the static power component to the total power number is growing very rapidly in the current era of Deep Sub-Micrometre (DSM) Design. Power can be estimated at a number of levels of detail. The higher levels of abstraction are faster and handle larger circuits, but are less accurate. The main levels include: *Circuit Level Power Estimation, using a circuit simulator such as SPICE *Static Power Estimation does not use the input vectors, but may use the input statistics. Analogous to static timing analysis. *Logic-Level Power Estimation, often linked to logic simulation. *Analysis at the Register-Transfer Level. Fast and high capacity, but not as accurate. Circuit-level power optimization A rendering of a small standard cell taken from a larger design showing heating effects directly related to power consumption. Many different techniques are used to reduce power consumption at the circuit level. Some of the main ones are: *Transistor sizing: adjusting the size of each gate or transistor for minimum power. *Voltage scaling: lower supply voltages use less power, but go slower. *Voltage islands: Different blocks can be run at different voltages, saving power. This design practice may require the use of level-shifters when two blocks with different supply voltages communicate with each other. *Variable VDD: The voltage for a single block can be varied during operation - high voltage (and high power) when the block needs to go fast, low voltage when slow operation is acceptable. *Multiple threshold voltages: Modern processes can build transistors with different thresholds. Power can be saved by using a mixture of CMOS transistors with two or more different threshold voltages. In the simplest form there are two different thresholds available, common called High-Vt and Low-Vt, where Vt stands for threshold voltage. High threshold transistors are slower but leak less, and can be used in non-critical circuits. *Power gating: This technique uses high Vt sleep transistors which cut-off a circuit block when the block is not switching. The sleep transistor sizing is an important design parameter. This technique, also known as MTCMOS, or Multi-Threshold CMOS reduces stand-by or leakage power, and also enables Iddq testing. *Long-Channel transistors: Transistors of more than minimum length leak less, but are bigger and slower. *Stacking and parking states: Logic gates may leak differently during logically equivalent input states (say 10 on a NAND gate, as opposed to 01). State machines may have less leakage in certain states. *Logic styles: dynamic and static logic, for example, have different speed/power tradeoffs. Logic synthesis for low power Logic synthesis can also be optimized in many ways to keep power consumption under control. Details of the following steps can have a significant impact on power optimization: *Clock gating *Logic Factorization *Path Balancing *Technology Mapping *State Encoding *Finite-State Machine Decomposition *Retiming Power Aware EDA Support There are file formats that can be used to write design files specifying the Power intent and implementation of a design. The information in these files allow the EDA tools to automatically insert power control features and to check that the result matches the intent. The IEEE DASC provides a home for developing this format in the form of the IEEE P1801 working group. During 2006 and the first two months of 2007, both Unified Power Format and Common Power Format were developed to support various tools. The IEEE P1801 working groups operates with the goal of providing for convergence of these two standards. Several EDA tools have been developed for supporting architectural level power estimation including McPAT,https://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/ Wattch,http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dbrooks/wattch-form.html and Simplepower.http://www.cse.psu.edu/research/mdl/software/simpower/simpower/?searchterm=simplepower  See also  * Data organization for low power References * Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook, by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, A survey of the field, from which the above summary was derived, with permission. * Jan M.

An uncontrolled intersection is a road intersection where no traffic lights, road markings or signs are used to indicate the right-of-way. They are found in either residential neighborhoods or in rural areas. While the intersection itself is unmarked, warning signs or lights may be present to alert drivers to it. Uncontrolled T-intersection At an uncontrolled T-intersection (3-way intersection), right-of-way rules differ from country to country. In Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and most of the United States, traffic on the terminating road must give way (yield) to traffic on the continuing road. In Germany, http://www.gesetze-im- internet.de/stvo/__8.html - in German - Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany) - :de:Stra√üenverkehrs-Ordnung (Deutschland): Vorfahrt - (German) Road Traffic Order: Right-of-way - Section 8 - Retrieved on September 20, 2012 traffic generally has to give way to traffic on the right at an uncontrolled intersection, whether it is a 3-way intersection or not. Uncontrolled 4-way intersection An uncontrolled intersection in suburban Melbourne, Australia At uncontrolled 4-way intersections the common rules are * give way to traffic approaching from the passenger's side (i.e. from the right in countries that drive on the right-hand side, rule known as priority to the right, and vice versa) **however, this may be the opposite depending on the local laws * turning traffic with crossing paths usually gives way to traffic driving straight through in the opposite direction * drivers opposite one another and both turning in their same direction, e.g. both drivers turning to their right (in countries that drive on the right-hand side), do not need to give way to one another as their paths will not cross. Common practice dictates that drivers will treat the intersection as if they have a give way (yield) sign and look both directions for cross-traffic to avoid any accidents with motorists who did not recognize or did not follow the uncontrolled intersection rule.

Van Artsdalen (January 31, 1941 ‚Äì July 18, 1979) was a legendary surfer. He moved to La Jolla, California, from his birthplace of Norfolk, Virginia, at age 14. Van Artsdalen is best known as a pioneer of surfing 25-foot waves at such North Shore locations as Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach; and tube riding in Hawaii during the early 1960-1970s. A member of the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, he appeared in several surf movies and remained a fixture of the international surfing community until his death from alcohol-related illness in 1979. Van Artsdalen's athletic prowess was first noted in the years he attended La Jolla High School where he earned varsity letter in baseball, basketball, and football. He began surfing at the age of fourteen, and chose to continue in the sport because of its unstructured freedom when compared to the discipline of conventional professional sports. While in La Jolla, Van Artsdalen became part of a well- known surfing group at Windansea Beach. He moved to Hawaii after graduating from high school to begin his professional career.Warshaw The challenging waves of Oahu's North Shore soon became Van Artsdalen's home. He was among the first to master the powerful, hollow waves at Ehukai Beach known as the Banzai Pipeline. This, along with his reputation for riding switchfoot in the large surf at Waimea Bay, earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Pipeline.\\"Warshaw Because of his talents, Van Artsdalen was featured in several early surf films by Dale Davis and Bruce Brown, the most notable of which was The Endless Summer. Van Artsdalen received onscreen credit in one of William Asher's \\"surfploitation\\" comedies, Muscle Beach Party, starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. He was recruited by artist and talent scout Michael Dormer to American International Pictures for auditions, but a violent temper precluded a film career. In 1964, Van Artsdalen was ranked among the world's best surfers by the Surfer Magazine Surfer Poll. A year later he was invited to join the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, becoming a global ambassador for wave riding and making appearances at shopping centers and promotional events. As surfing evolved during the late 1960s from heavier, more cumbersome longboards to lighter, shorter boards, Van Artsdalen's reputation was gradually eclipsed by a new generation of tube riders such as Gerry Lopez and Rory Russell. Still, he remained at Banzai Pipeline, working as a lifeguard in his later years. In 1969 Van Artsdalen won the 34th Annual Stone Steps Invitational Surf Contest at Stone Steps in Leucadia, California. Surfing had grown in popularity by that point, and Van Artsdalen felt the purity of the sport was being spoiled by posers. He frequently succumbed to binge drinking, and died of alcohol- related causes in 1979.Warshaw The only family authenticated Butch Van Artsdalen surfboard made since Butch‚Äôs passing is made by Bill Shorsbee.

The minimum age is frequently set at 55 years old, but it can vary. These communities are set up to accommodate older individuals who would like to live in an area without the perceived problems of having children around. In most cases a younger spouse or significant other is permitted to live in the community as long as one member meets the minimum age requirement. Age- qualified communities, also known as 55+ communities, active adult communities, lifestyle communities, or retirement communities, are often planned communities that offer homes and community features that are attractive to 55+ adults. These might include a clubhouse or lifestyle center with a good many activities, sometimes with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, exercise facilities, craft rooms, demonstration kitchens, and decks and patios for gathering. Canada A noteworthy Canadian example, Arbutus Ridge Seaside Community for Active Adults in the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island, was the first comprehensive retirement community built in Canada. It is a private community that subsequently became the template and proving ground for what has become accepted and commonplace. In 2015, that template was expanded in line with the growing desire for spiritually focused retirement living as Global Kingdom Ministries unveiled Trinity Ravine Towers in Toronto, one of the country's first Christian community living condominium complexes. United States An entertainment venue at The Villages, Florida. According to 55places.com, Florida has the most age-restricted communities with more than 375 communities, with New Jersey coming in second with more than 230 age- restricted communities. Other popular states for age-restricted communities include Oregon, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah. While in the United States discrimination in housing is generally prohibited, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 (109 STAT. 787) allow communities to restrict residency to older individuals. Individuals may buy into these properties regardless of age; however, the owner may be prohibited from occupying the property according to the association declarations and bylaws. According to research compiled by TRI Pointe Homes, there are 75 million people who comprise the boomer generation and over 32 million of these who are over the age of 55 would consider living in an age-restricted community. Costs With most age restricted communities, there are homeowner association (HOA) fees that cover services and amenities to resident such as golf courses, game nights, clubhouses, pools, and landscaping. In the United States, these fees can range from $100 ‚Äî $500 a month. Communities Criticism of age-restricted communities  A common problem occurs when the homeowner dies; if the surviving resident does not meet the requirements for ownership, then he or she is forced to sell the home. This can happen even if the survivor is the spouse of the deceased. However, many age-restricted communities have circumvented this issue by allowing the survivor to maintain residency as noted in the deed restrictions. Another common problem arises when a change in the family situation renders a grandparent responsible for a grandchild. Often grandchildren are prohibited from living more than a short time (often 90 days) in a community.

It was directed by David Odell and written by Charles S. Haas based on the novel of the same name by science-fiction author Fredric Brown. Synopsis After years of pursuing a Jazz career that never quite took shape, Mark Deveraux took several jobs writing TV Show themes and commercial jingles to earn a living; while very successful in acquiring steady work, he longs to write meaningful music. After winning out over several more experienced composers to score a sci-fi film, he spends a weekend in a cabin trying to develop a song that sounds like a 'universal greeting' based on the producer's instruction. Finally composing something that he believes is worthwhile, he calls his girlfriend, who is the producer for an internationally syndicated talk radio show, who accidentally broadcasts the song. The following day, while recovering from a hangover, Devereaux is visited by a Martian who claims that they heard the greeting and have come to Earth to establish lasting peace and prosperity on the planet -- only to immediately recant and state that he was joking. He claims that \\"Mars is a dump\\" and that the billions of bored Martians have decided to come to Earth and fun at humanity's expense. Devereaux tries to shoot him, but discovers that he has the ability to both read minds and teleport, allowing him to predict and dodge any attack. Around the globe, billions of Martians begin to wreak havoc with their abilities, revealing intimate secrets, appearing and disrupting major sporting events, and spying on couples voyeuristically while having sex (as they cannot reproduce sexually). Deveraux realizes that they felt 'invited' by his music and interrupts another national broadcast to play the song again -- realizing too late that he needs to play it in reverse. Feigning insanity, he is committed to a psychiatric hospital where his girlfriend eventually breaks him free. Trying again, they hijack another international broadcast while Devereaux plays the song backwards. In spite of numerous distractions and ploys by the Martians, he succeeds and the Martians simultaneously disappear from around the globe. Having realized that he has talent, a short time later he quits his jobs for Hollywood and reforms his Jazz quartet to go on the road.

He unified all of Upper Nubia from Mero√´ to the Third Cataract and is possibly attested at the Temple of Amun at Kawa. Alara also established Napata as the religious capital of Kush. Alara himself was not a 25th dynasty Kushite king since he never controlled any region of Egypt during his reign compared to his two immediate successors: Kashta and Piye respectively. Nubian literature credits him with a substantial reign since future Nubian kings requested that they might enjoy a reign as long as Alara's. His memory was also central to the origin myth of the Kushite kingdom, which was embellished with new elements over time. Alara was a deeply revered figure in Nubian culture and the first Kushite king whose name came down to scholars.T√∂r√∂k, p.123 Alara in the historical records Alara's existence is first documented in the Egyptian hieroglyphic stele of Queen TabiryFrom Ku.53, Khartoum 1901; Dows Dunham, Nuri, Boston. 1950, figs 29f who was Alara's daughter by Queen Kasaqa, Alara's wife. Since Tabiry was the wife of Piye whereas Piye's direct predecessor on the throne of Kush was Kashta, Alara was most likely Kashta's predecessor in turn.T√∂r√∂k, p.123 While Alara was not assigned a royal title in Queen Tabiry's stele, his name was written in the form of a cartouche which confirms that he was indeed a Kushite king.T√∂r√∂k, p.124 Alara is also mentioned as the brother of Taharqa's grandmother in inscriptions Kawa IV lines 16fKhartoum 2678; M.F.L. Macadam, The Temples of Kawa I. The Inscriptions, London 1949. 14ff (ca. 685 BC) and VI, lines 23f.Khartoum, 2679; Macadam, 32ff (ca. 680 BC) One Nubian archaeologist, Timothy Kendall, has claimed that Alara is the king 'Ary' Meryamun whose Year 23 is inscribed on a now fragmented stele from the Temple of Amun at Kawa. However, the Hungarian Egyptologist L√°szl√≥ T√∂r√∂k rejects this view in his 1997 book The Kingdom of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization. (Handbuch der Orientalistik 31) and believes that Ary was rather Aryamani who was a much later Kushite post-25th dynasty king who ruled from Mero√´ due to the text and style of his stele. Kendall's epigraphic arguments here are also not accepted by other scholars. Tomb Alara was succeeded in power by Kashta who extended Nubia's influence to Elephantine and Thebes. He was buried at the royal cemetery of El-Kurru downstream from NapataT√∂r√∂k, pp.148-150 Alara's wife, Queen Kasaqa, was buried in tomb Ku.23 (El-Kurru 23).Kendall, op. cit., p.65 & figure 1 on p.98 Her tomb was located right next to tomb Ku.9 which is presumed to belong to Alara himself.Kendall, p.65 Kendall notes that the occupant of Ku.9 (likely Alara): : was interred in the traditional Nubian manner, lying on a bed and placed in a small enclosed side- chamber at the bottom of a vertical shaft, the visible tomb superstructure incorporated many Egyptian features. The apex seems to have been adorned with a crudely cast, hollow bronze ba statue...The chapel had contained a plain, hard stone Egyptian-style offering table, and the chapel walls had been adorned with crude low relief. One block preserved what appeared to be the upper part of a male head, wearing a crown with a superstructure and streamers and a loop-like ornament over the brow, imitative of a uraeus...This feature suggests either that the owner of the tomb, by the end of his reign, had come close to identifying himself as a true pharaoh, or that his successor (Kashta?) who would have built the tomb and authorized the reliefs, provided such sentiments in the posthumous depiction. T√∂r√∂k concurs and writes that \\"the mortuary cult chapel of Ku.9 seems to have been the first to be provided with a tomb stele and a funerary offering table\\" in el-Kurru, the royal burial grounds of the early Kushite kings.

The crystal lattice structure achieved is thin, uniform, and aligned with the structure of the substrate. The reactants are brought to the substrate as alternating pulses with \\"dead\\" times in between. ALE makes use of the fact that the incoming material is bound strongly until all sites available for chemisorption are occupied. The dead times are used to flush the excess material. It is mostly used in semiconductor fabrication to grow thin films of thickness in the nanometer scale. Technique This technique was invented in 1974 and patented the same year (patent published in 1976) by Dr. Tuomo Suntola at the Instrumentarium company, Finland. Dr. Suntola's purpose was to grow thin films of Zinc sulfide to fabricate electroluminescent flat panel displays. The main trick used for this technique is the use of a self-limiting chemical reaction to control in an accurate way the thickness of the film deposited. Since the early days, ALE (ALD) has grown to a global thin film technology which has enabled the continuation of Moore's law. In 2018, Suntola received the Millennium Technology Prize for ALE (ALD) technology. Compared to basic chemical vapour deposition, in ALE (ALD), chemical reactants are pulsed alternatively in a reaction chamber and then chemisorb in a saturating manner on the surface of the substrate, forming a chemisorbed monolayer. ALD introduces two complementary precursors (e.g. Al(CH3)3 and H2O ) alternatively into the reaction chamber. Typically, one of the precursors will adsorb onto the substrate surface until it saturates the surface and further growth cannot occur until the second precursor is introduced. Thus the film thickness is controlled by the number of precursor cycles rather than the deposition time as is the case for conventional CVD processes. ALD allows for extremely precise control of film thickness and uniformity.

It was opened in 1883 and the remaining section formally closed in 2002 although abandoned for ten years. A significant amount of controversy surrounded the ownership status of the line in its early years. Construction and controversy The reason this line was constructed was little different from why many bush tramways throughout New Zealand were constructed in the days before modern road transportation. It was built to run from the Fernhill coal mine to the Main South Line, about 2.75 kilometres south so that the company's owners had easy railway access. In 1882, the Fernhill Railway & Colliery Company Ltd. commenced work on the line and it was finished the next year, opening on 9 July 1883. For the first four years, the company continued to maintain the line while trains were operated by the government's New Zealand Railways Department (NZR). The controversy began when the line's ownership was granted to the government without compensation to the colliery company under the Government Railways Act of 1887. In 1891, the owners of the Fernhill Colliery commenced legal proceedings against the government for compensation on the basis that the Act should not be applied to private railways. During this time, the colliery fell into financial difficulties and the mine did not operate between March 1892 and February 1893, meaning no trains were required to run. The mine and line had only been operating again briefly when railway commissioners took control of the railway on 6 March 1893. Almost two years later, on 6 December 1894, the courts awarded the line to the mortgagees, but later that month, on the 24th, traffic again stopped. In 1895, the line was passed to new owners on 4 June and then six months later, NZR themselves purchased it on 19 December. The ownership disputes were finally settled and the line became the state-owned Fernhill Branch. Operation The branch line's junction with the Main South Line was located at the Dunedin suburban station of Abbotsford and immediately climbed a 1:43 grade to the McSkimmings brickworks site crossing North Taieri Road to pass the factory site's small rail yard and then across Abbots Hill Road towards the Fernhill coal mine site. Passenger services never operated on the line, and freight was carried only when required so no timetable was ever instituted. Additional traffic came from a brickworks and the cartage of building sand, and while there was meant to be a guarantee of a minimum amount of coal traffic, this was rarely honoured and never enforced. The mine shut down on 13 July 1925 and trains stopped operating beyond the brickworks, but formal closure of the unused section was not announced until 20 February 1930. After this date, the closed portion was partially dismantled back to the brickworks clay pit area. The branch today Part of the remaining section to the brickworks was open as an industrial spur to the McSkimmings Industries complex, but it was disused for many years and banned from all rail use in 1995. The remaining length of line from McSkimmings was lifted back to the Main South Line in 2000. The incline formation has now been built over. Evidence of the now dismantled branch can still be sighted, with some of the line's formation visible, such as an embankment and a cutting. Tracks are still in-situ on the formation at Abbots Hill Road level crossing including a wagon turntable that served the McSkimmings brickworks clay pit and store yard. One of the line's bridges is still in use as part of a private farm access road. There is currently no public access to the site of the old mine and the branch's terminus, and it is not visible from public roads. The former rail formation is well defined on the Google Maps Satellite view.

The only Naval technical center headquartered in a major fleet concentration area, NIWC Pacific manages strategic locations both in the Pacific theater and around the world. NIWC Pacific is advancing the Navy's employment of next generation unmanned systems and autonomous vehicles, large data management, antenna design, clean and renewable energy sources, and both offensive and defensive cyber programs. As the primary research arm of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), NIWC Pacific supports basic research and prototype development, basic and applied science, extensive test and evaluation services, systems engineering and integration, installation and full spectrum life-cycle support of fielded systems. With worldwide connectivity and numerous partnerships with private industry and academia, NIWC Pacfic addresses warfighting requirements for Navy, Joint, National and Coalition war fighters. The laboratory operates as a Naval Working Capital Fund organization and relies on funding from both Navy and non-Navy sponsors rather than direct Congressional appropriations. The vast majority of its workforce is located in San Diego, CA, with detachments located in Hawaii, Guam, and Japan. History On June 1, 1940, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox established the Navy's first laboratory on the West Coast, the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory. Its mission was to perform research and development in communications and radio propagation. In 1943, a second West Coast laboratory was established in the high desert at Inyokern, Calif., the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS), charged with improving naval weapons systems, particularly those dropped from aircraft.\\"SSC Pacific Celebrating 70th Anniversary in 2010,\\" SSC Pacific Daily News Bulletin, Sept. 4, 2014. Over the next several decades, those two organizations changed names several times: the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Lab became the U.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory, the Naval Command Control and Communications Laboratory Center, and the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center (NELC); while NOTS became the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Naval Undersea Research and Development Center, and the Naval Undersea Center (NUC). On March 1, 1977, NELC and NUC were consolidated to form the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC). These Navy research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E;) organizations specialized in command, control and communications (C3); Arctic submarine warfare; undersea weapons systems; intelligence and undersea surveillance technology, as well as a number of other important areas including lasers, underwater vehicles, environmental science, high performance computing, robotics and marine mammal research. During the 1990s, NOSC was renamed following several Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) actions starting with the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center (NCCOSC) RDT&E; Division, then the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego; also added were a number of other Navy commands, including the NCCOSC In-Service Engineering (NISE) West Coast Division; and some substantive changes in business areas, including the loss of leadership roles in anti-submarine warfare weapons systems and Arctic submarine warfare, and the gain of in-service engineering functions and navigation technology. In late 2008, the organization was assigned the name Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific). In early 2019, the organization was assigned its current name, Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific (NIWC Pacific). SPAWAR in San Diego SPAWAR Headquarters In 1997, San Diego became the headquarters of the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), formerly located in the Washington, DC areaGlobalSecurity.org and is now located in the Old Town neighborhood. SPAWAR and its subordinate Echelon III Activities provide much of the tactical and non-tactical information management technology required by the Navy to complete its operational missions. These include NIWC Pacific, its counterpart, NIWC Atlantic, located in Charleston, South Carolina, along with the SPAWAR Space Field Activity, located in Chantilly, Virginia. SPAWAR headquarters in San Diego, CA is registered as an active superfund clean-up site by the EPA. In September 2014, more than 150 employees in the public affairs and engineering departments of SPAWAR's facility in the Old Town neighborhood had to be moved to other spaces within Old Town Campus to avoid toxic trichloroethylene (TCE) vapors. Soil and groundwater beneath the Naval site is contaminated with byproducts from World War II era missile and aircraft production. TCE is a volatile metal-cleaning agent. Since 2011, the Navy has been removing toxic waste, which has reduced TCE levels beneath the building. The Navy plans to complete its cleanup by 2018. In October 2018, the Navy said it is planning to renovate or redevelop the Old Town site, and issued a Request for Interest to recruit possible private-sector partners in the endeavor.

It grew from the Halifax Journal, which was started in 1883. The Davidson family purchased the newspaper in 1928 and retained control until bankruptcy in 2009. In 1986, The Morning Journal and Evening News merged into one morning newspaper. The newspaper began its online services in 1994. History Daytona's early settlers decided that a newspaper would be important for the development of the town. A group of citizens raised money to persuade Florian A. Mann to move his printing press from Ohio to Daytona and start a new publication. Prior to publication of the first issue, 86 subscribers were signed up, all paid in advance. Advertisers also paid in advance for the first three months. The first issue was scheduled for release on February 1, 1883; however, a schooner bringing the blank paper to Florida shipwrecked off the coast of the Carolinas, with the loss of all hands and cargo. This delayed publication of the first issue until Mann decided to buy a bolt of cotton cloth from Laurence Thompson's dry goods store to use as a substitute. The first issue of the Halifax Journal was printed and published on the cotton cloth, dated February 15, 1883. The premier issue contained local news, as well as Mann's editorial of praise and hope for the Halifax area. The Halifax Journal continued as a weekly publication until Mann sold the newspaper in 1889 to J.M. Jolley. In 1908, Jolley died and the newspaper was bought by Galen Seaman. After Seaman's death, the paper was bought by W.C. Carter of the Halifax Printing Company, which operated a printing shop connected with the Halifax Journal. After selling the Halifax Journal, Mann moved to Ormond and started the Ormond Gazette. He later sold this paper to L. Moreton Murray and returned to Daytona, to start the Daytona News. Thomas E. Fitzgerald bought the Daytona News in 1900 and the Ormond Gazette in 1903. Fitzgerald consolidated the two papers and on December 1, 1903, published the first issue of The Daytona Daily News. Hugh Sparkman started a stock company which bought the Halifax Journal and turned it into a daily publication. In 1926, the stock company bought The Daytona Daily News from Fitzgerald. The stock company ceased publication of The Morning Journal, but continued The Evening News and The Sunday News-Journal. In 1928, Julius Davidson and his son, Herbert M. Davidson, purchased a majority interest in the company, beginning an 80-year period of single family control of the publication. Soon after, the minority owner sold his interest to R.H. Gore, a competitor. The minority shares were later sold to Perry Publications, the owner of The Palm Beach Post. In 1969, The Palm Beach Post was purchased by Cox Enterprises, a media company that owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other publications. Cox acquired Perry's 47.5% interest in the News-Journal, assigned a value of $5 million, as part of the transaction. The Davidson family continued to hold a 52.5% majority of the stock. Cox was not represented on the board of directors and had no say in corporate decisions. The News-Journal Center The News-Journal Center in Daytona Beach In January 2003, the News-Journal offered to pay $13 million for naming rights to a new performing arts center in Daytona Beach being built as a new home for the Seaside Music Theater, founded by News-Journal CEO Tippen Davidson. Cox Enterprises filed suit against the News-Journal Corp. (NJC) in U.S. Federal Court, alleging they \\"acted irresponsibly in spending corporate funds\\". Cox alleged that the Davidson family spent the newspaper's money without consulting with them. Court documents reveal that in the five-year period prior to the filing of Cox's complaint, at least 58 employees of Davidson's arts and entertainment ventures were on the News-Journal Corp. payroll, unbeknownst to NJC's sole minority shareholder. Despite the fact that these employees did no work for NJC, the corporation provided them with full salaries and benefits, at a cost to the company of at least $5.7 million. The trial court found that tens of millions of dollars were diverted to Davidson family projects to \\"indulge [the Davidsons'] personal interests in the arts\\". After failing to have the suit dismissed, the News-Journal Corp. decided to exercise its option to buy out the minority shares. In 2006, the federal court set a valuation of $129.2 million on Cox's interest in the paper. Newspaper management announced in April 2008 that the newspaper would be sold in order to satisfy the judgment. On April 17, 2009, the News-Journal announced its intention to declare bankruptcy, but the judge overseeing the case rejected that option. The board of directors was subsequently removed and the company was placed under court control, with James Hopson serving as the court- appointed manager. New ownership Halifax Media Holdings purchased the News-Journal on March 1, 2010 for $20 million and assumed control on April 1, 2010. Michael Redding, Halifax Media's CEO and a former News-Journal department manager, welcomed Bill Offill as publisher of the paper on July 29, 2013. Halifax Media became the 12th largest media company in the U.S., publishing 33 newspapers and affiliated websites in five states, mostly in the Southeast. The company was owned by a group of investors, including Stephens Capital Partners, of Little Rock, Arkansas; JAARSSS Media of Destin, Florida; and Redding Investments of Daytona Beach.

The term often refers to the history of jazz in Japan, which has the largest proportion of jazz fans in the world, according to some estimates. Attempts at fusing jazz with Japanese culture in the United States are commonly termed Asian-American jazz. History of jazz in Japan Early jazz music was popularized in Japan thanks to the overseas trips of both Americans and Filipino jazz bands, the latter having acquainted themselves with the music in their native country through the presence of the American occupying forces.William Minor Jazz Journeys to Japan: The Heart Within, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2004, p.9; E. Taylor Atkins Blue Nippon: Authenticating Jazz in Japan, Durham: Duke University Press, 2001, pp. 58-60 The Hatano Jazz Band is sometimes described as the first Japanese jazz band, having absorbed some music during boat trips to San Francisco,Lash, Max E. (23 December 1964) \\"Jazz in Japan\\". The Japan Times. p. 5. although they were principally a dance band.Atkins Blue Nippon, p. 53 Built around the performances of the Filipinos, local jazz practice began to emerge in Japan in the early 1920s, most notably in the prosperous entertainment districts of Osaka and Kobe. By 1924 the city of Osaka already boasted twenty dance halls, which gave many Japanese-born musicians the first opportunity to play jazz themselves professionally.Atkins Blue Nippon, p. 58 Trumpeter Fumio Nanri (1910‚Äì1975) was the first of these Japanese jazz performers to gain international acclaim for his playing style. In 1929 Nanri traveled to Shanghai, where he played with Teddy Weatherford, and in 1932 he toured in the United States. After his return to Japan, Nanri made several recordings with his Hot Peppers, an American-style swing band. The \\"Americanness\\" and mass appeal of early jazz as dance music gave reason for concern among the conservative Japanese elite, and in 1927 Osaka municipal officials issued ordinances that forced the dance halls to close. A large number of young musicians switched to the jazz scene in Tokyo, where some found employment in the house jazz orchestras of the major recording companies.Atkins Blue Nippon, pp. 58 and 70-2. In the 1930s, popular song composers Ryoichi Hattori and Koichi Sugii tried to overcome jazz music's controversial qualities by creating a distinctively Japanese kind of jazz music. They reworked ancient Japanese folk or theatre songs with a jazz touch, and in addition wrote new jazz songs that had Japanese thematic content and often closely resembled well-known traditional melodies.Atkins Blue Nippon, pp. 132-9. In 1933 Chigusa, Japan's first jazz cafe, or jazu kissa, opened in Osaka.Atkins Blue Nippon, pp. 5 and 74 Since then, jazz coffeehouses have provided a popular alternative to the dance hall, offering the latest jazz records (while occasionally also hosting live performances) to an attentively listening audience.David Novak 2008 \\"2,5 x 6 metres of space: Japanese music coffeehouses and experimental practices of listening\\", Popular Music, 27:1: 15-34 Hattori's songs, however, flirted with controversy, most notably in his 1940 , which he wrote for Tadaharu Nakano's Rhythm Boys. Satirizing the shortages of food and material then widespread in Japan, the song drew the ire of government censors and was quickly banned. The controversy was among the factors that led to the Rhythm Boys' breakup in 1941. During World War II, jazz was considered \\"enemy music\\" and banned in Japan. However, by then the genre had become far too popular for a complete ban to be successful. Jazz- like songs, sometimes of a strongly patriotic type, continued to be performed, though these songs were usually referred to as \\"light music.\\"Atkins Blue Nippon, pp. 127-63. After the war, the Allied Occupation (1945‚Äì1952) of Japan provided a new incentive for Japanese jazz musicians to emerge, as the American troops were eager to hear the music they listened to back home. Pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi (born 1929) arrived in Tokyo in 1948, determined to become a professional jazz musician. After having formed the Cozy Quartet she was then noticed by Hampton Hawes, who was stationed in Yokohama with his military band, and brought to the attention of Oscar Peterson. Akiyoshi studied at the Berklee School of Music in Boston in 1956, and later achieved worldwide success as a bop pianist and big band leader.[Minor Jazz Journeys, pp. 31-41; Atkins Blue Nippon, pp. 207-9 and 240-1; J. Bradford Robinson and Barry Kernfeld. \\"Akiyoshi, Toshiko\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd ed., edited by Barry Kernfeld. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, (accessed October 14, 2009). By the end of the 1950s, native jazz practice again flourished in Japan, and in the following decades an active free jazz scene reached its full growth. Critic Teruto Soejima considered 1969 as a pivotal year for Japanese free jazz, with musicians such as drummer Masahiko Togashi, guitarist Masayuki Takayanagi, pianists Yosuke Yamashita and Masahiko Satoh, saxophonist Kaoru Abe, bassist Motoharu Yoshizawa, and trumpeter Itaru Oki playing a major role. Other Japanese jazz artists who acquired international reputations include Sadao Watanabe (the former soloist of Akiyoshi's Cozy Quartet), Ryo Kawasaki, Teruo Nakamura (musician), Toru \\"Tiger\\" Okoshi and Makoto Ozone. Most of these musicians have toured extensively in the United States and some have moved there permanently for a career in jazz performance or education.Minor Jazz Journeys, pp. 22-30, 45-58, 136-45 and 273-7. Jazz and Japanese culture Japanese jazz had frequently been criticized as derivative, or even as an unworthy imitation of U.S. jazz, both by American and Japanese commentators. In response to the belittling attitude of their audience, Japanese jazz artists began adding a \\"national flavor\\" to their work in the 1960s.Atkins, Blue Nippon, pp. 165-264. Expatriate Toshiko Akiyoshi drew on Japanese culture in compositions for the big band she co-led with her husband and long-term collaborator Lew Tabackin. On Kogun (1974) they first utilized traditional instruments, such as the tsuzumi, and Long Yellow Road (1975) features an adaptation of a melody from the Japanese tradition of court music (\\"Children in the Temple Ground\\").Atkins Blue Nippon, pp. 240-1; Minor Jazz Journeys, pp. 31-41 Inspired by the analogies Akiyoshi presented to him between jazz music and Zen Buddhism, jazz writer William Minor has suggested that a Zen aesthetic can be perceived in the music of Masahiko Satoh and other Japanese jazz artists.Minor Jazz Journeys, pp. 39, 58 and passim Recent developments= 2000s  Around the turn of the millennium, Tokyo remained the base for a small but thriving jazz community.Minor, Jazz Journeys, pp. 316‚Äì322. Jazz singer and pianist Ayado Chie managed to reach out to a larger audience (both in Japan and internationally) with her emulation of black American vocal jazz.Atkins, Blue Nippon, pp. 271‚Äì272. In 2004, Blue Note Records released an album by 17-year- old mainstream and bop pianist Takashi (Matsunaga) featuring his own compositions, Storm Zone. Takashi's most recent CD is titled Love Makes the Earth Float (2008). In 2005 Japanese jazz group Soil & \\"Pimp\\" Sessions released their full-length debut Pimp Master, with tracks of the album gaining attention from DJs abroad and they began to receive heavy air-play on Gilles Peterson's Worldwide radio program on BBC Radio 1 in the UK. This got the album released in Europe on Compost and in UK on Peterson's Brownswood Recordings and subsequent albums by Soil & Pimp got released on Brownswood, making them arguably the most popular club jazz band to come out of Japan. Osaka based quartet Indigo jam unit have released eleven original and four cover albums since their debut with the album Demonstration in 2006 and have been described as a tight and energetic mix between a traditional jazz sound and nu jazz with distinctive beats and flowing jazz piano. After releasing their 11th album Lights in 2015, they announced that they would break up in summer of the following year Jazz pianist Hiromi Uehara has received worldwide recognition since her debut in 2003 with Another Mind, which was a critical success in North America and in her native Japan, where the album shipped gold (100,000 units) and received the Recording Industry Association of Japan‚Äôs (RIAJ) Jazz Album of the Year Award. In 2009, she recorded with pianist Chick Corea Duet, a two-disc live recording of their transcendent, transgenerational and transcultural duo concert in Tokyo. She also appeared on bassist Stanley Clarke‚Äôs Heads Up International release, Jazz in the Garden, which also featured former Chick Corea bandmate, drummer Lenny White.In 2011 Hiromi started her piano trio project, THE TRIO PROJECT with Anthony Jackson and Simon Phillips and has released four albums under the name of this project. Recently not only does she play with jazz musicians but also she collaborates with notable J-pop musicians and bands and orchestras such as Akiko Yano, DREAMS COME TRUE, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, and New Japan Philharmonic.  2010s  Influenced by modern jazz in America that utilizes odd meters and rhythmic and harmonic elements of Hip hop, R&B;, and Neo soul, the sound of Japanese jazz has become more musically complicated and diverse. The bands and artists that represent those new sounds includes MEGAPTERAS, Yasei Collective, Shun Ishiwaka(Áü≥Ëã•Èßø), Mononkul and Takuya Kuroda. While modern jazz sound is becoming mainstream in the music scene, there are still some jazz musicians who plays traditional style of jazz such as Bebop, Hard bop, and post-bop. In 2012, jazz pianist Ai Kuwabara, whose style is described as post- Hiromi Uehara, released her first album from here to there. Five years later, she recorded somehow, someday, somewhere, in which Ai collaborated with American jazz drummer Steve Gadd and bassist Will Lee. Shun Ishiwaka, jazz drummer and composer, has received huge recognition in Japan because of his incomparable technique and cutting-edge sound and been a part of many recordings and projects with notable musicians such as Terumasa Hino, Tokyo New City Orchestra, Taylor McFerrin, and Jason Moran. Shun released his debut album Cleanup in 2015 in which he combined elements of contemporary classical music, hip hop, and straight ahead jazz and this album received \\"Album of the year new star praise\\" and ‚ÄúJazz album of the year 2015‚Äù from Japan‚Äôs two biggest jazz magazines Jazz Japan and Jazz life respectively. In 2016, Shun had a concert with his own trio having guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel as a guest at Blue Note Tokyo. Ryu Fukui, a now deceased Jazz pianist who, in life, struggled to achieve recognition outside of Japan, experienced a monumental rise in popularity thanks to streaming platforms like YouTube Music, Spotify, and others. His most notable work, 1976's \\"Scenery\\" is now the most widely consumed Japanese Jazz album on YouTube, having accrued nearly 10 million views as of July 2020. This has led to his albums being reprinted for commercial sale, some of which even using the original studio tapes from 1976, and mastered in half speed.

He was an all rounder. Fairfax had a rapid rise to international honours, making his test debut the same season as his first class debut. His test career was cut short when he emigrated to England in 1932 to play in the Lancashire League as a professional. Biography Fairfax's uncle was a top grade player, BW Fairfax. Early years Fairfax was a child prodigy as a player, breaking records for Kogarah School. At age 14 he made 1,942 runs and took 130 wickets over the summer. He was soon playing for St George in grade cricket. However over the next few summers his form suffered and it seemed he would not live up to his initial promise. His form improved over the 1927‚Äì28 summer, scoring a century against Cumberland. Good form early in 1928‚Äì29 saw him selected for NSW Colts in October 1928. He scored 107 against Queensland Colts. First Class Debut Fairfax made his first class debut shortly afterwards, playing Victoria for NSW, opening the batting with Archie Jackson. He made 2 and 30 and took 1-30 and 3‚Äì45 in a drawn match. Fairfax's second state game was against Queensland; he took 1-69 and 2-66 and scored 58 and 9. Fairfax batted down the order against South Australia, scoring 36 and 20 and taking 4-54 and 3-82, making him New South Wales' best bowler in their victory. Fairfax' fourth first glass game was against Victoria. He was back as opener and scored 104 in the first innings ‚Äì his debut (and, as it turn out, sole) first class century, though overshone by the 340 of teammate Don Bradman. He took 0-35 and 2‚Äì54 with the ball. According to a contemporary report: > A bowler of his years able to make runs in this way is well worthy of keen > consideration. Fairfax is a hard-driving batsman, and a medium-pace bowler. > With his club at first, he was inclined to bowl too fast. He has dropped to > medium pace, and, as a result, has a good change of pace in. the fast ball, > and is able to spin the ball at his normal pace. Besides, he is not above > sending down a yorker ‚Äì a ball most bowlers these days have quite forgotten. Another writer of the time said: > Fairfax has cricket in him.- He would probably be at his best going in > seventh or eighth in a crack side... He has been doing something useful with > bat and ball in each representative game he has played. He has height and > reach, and drives well... He... needs to tone up his running between > wickets. Fairfax impressed in a rain-shortened game against the touring English side for NSW, top scoring with 40 in the first innings and taking 3-36 opening the bowling, his victims including Jack Hobbs, Maurice Leyland and Percy Chapman. Against South Australia, Fairfax scored 17 and 41 and took 0-47 and 4-55, bowling his team to a 60 run victory. Test Debut against England These consistent performances led to his selection in the fifth test against the touring English side. It had been a rapid rise, selected for international honours only a few weeks after his first class debut, but the selectors were keen to trial new players at the end of what had been a disastrous series for Australia: other debutants selected for that game included Percy Hornibrook and Tim Wall; it was only the second test for Don Bradman and Archie Jackson and the third test for Ron Oxenham. Fairfax and Oxenham played in tandem as all rounders. One writer described Fairfax as: > Over six feet, straight as a ramrod, for one his size he is remarkably quick > on his feet.

When England bowled he took 1-84, the wicket being Patsy Hendren, and he took catches to dismiss Walter Hammond, George Duckworth an Maurice Leyland. When Australia batted, Fairfax came to the wicket when his team was 4-203 and took part in a record 183 run partnership with Bradman, making 65. Fairfax took 1‚Äì20 in England's second innings ‚Äì the wicket of Hammond ‚Äì and catches to dismiss Jack Hobbs and Maurice Tate. He was not required to bat in the second innings, with Australia winning by five wickets. Fairfax had taken 422 first class runs tat summer at 38.36 and 25 wickets at 27.08. That winter, Fairfax got a job in a sports store. 1929‚Äì30 Season Fairfax's domestic performances were solid the following summer. He scored 49 and 21 against Queensland, picking up 3‚Äì47 in both innings as New South Wales won by 23 runs.

In November 1931 it was announced he had signed a deal to play as a professional for Accrington in the Lancashire League at ¬£20 a week. He was to leave in March but he ruled himself out of international cricket. He only played two first class games in Australia that summer both for NSW, one against Queensland (1-21 and 2-24, 5)https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14100.html and the touring South Africans (0-62 and 0‚Äì5, 3).https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14102.html He was not available for the tests against South Africa ‚Äì Ron Oxenham took his place. It was a relatively uncontroversial decision at the time ‚Äì something Don Bradman brought up in 1932‚Äì33 when he was much criticised for considering an offer to play league cricket. Fairfax played in the Lancashire League for two summers. In 1932 he made 738 runs at 32.08 and took 43 wickets at 20.11. In 1933 he made 952 runs at 52.88 and took 51 wickets at 16.45. Post playing career In 1934 Fairfax set up an indoor cricket school in London which he run until 1937 when it shut down. In 1934 he played his last first class game for the Gentlemen against the Players, scoring 15 and taking 0‚Äì102.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15103.html In 1937 he coached at Eton College. He worked for Sir Julius Cahn's private team and was a critic of Don Bradman's captaincy. In 1939 he coached Notts county. In World War II he was a pilot officer in the RAF. He wound up a patient in a sanitorium, where he met the King in June 1946. After the war he worked for a London Sunday newspaper and continued to coach all year round at schools, running clinics. He returned to Australia over the 1950‚Äì51 summer to cover the Ashes for English newspapers. He also attended games during the 1953 Ashes and continued to write on cricket matters. Fairax suffered health problems from an injury incurred during the war. He fell ill just before Christmas 1954 and died in May 1955 at age 48.

This form of epitaxial growth is performed in an ultrahigh vacuum system. The reactants are in the form of molecular beams of reactive gases, typically as the hydride or a metalorganic. The term CBE is often used interchangeably with metal-organic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE). The nomenclature does differentiate between the two (slightly different) processes, however. When used in the strictest sense, CBE refers to the technique in which both components are obtained from gaseous sources, while MOMBE refers to the technique in which the group III component is obtained from a gaseous source and the group V component from a solid source.  Basic principles  Chemical beam epitaxy was first demonstrated by W.T. Tsang in 1984. This technique was then described as a hybrid of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) that exploited the advantages of both the techniques. In this initial work, InP and GaAs were grown using gaseous group III and V alkyls. While group III elements were derived from the pyrolysis of the alkyls on the surface, the group V elements were obtained from the decomposition of the alkyls by bringing in contact with heated Tantalum (Ta) or Molybdenum (Mo) at 950-1200 ¬∞C. Typical pressure in the gas reactor is between 102 Torr and 1 atm for MOCVD. Here, the transport of gas occurs by viscous flow and chemicals reach the surface by diffusion. In contrast, gas pressures of less than 10‚àí4 Torr are used in CBE. The gas transport now occurs as molecular beam due to the much longer mean-free paths, and the process evolves to a chemical beam deposition. It is also worth noting here that MBE employs atomic beams (such as aluminium (Al) and Gallium (Ga)) and molecular beams (such as As4 and P4) that are evaporated at high temperatures from solid elemental sources, while the sources for CBE are in vapor phase at room temperatures. A comparison of the different processes in the growth chamber for MOCVD, MBE and CBE can be seen in figure 1. Figure 1: Basic processes inside the growth chambers of a) MOCVD, b) MBE, and c) CBE.  Experimental setup  A combination of turbomolecular and cryo pumps are used in standard UHV growth chambers. The chamber itself is equipped with a liquid nitrogen cryoshield and a rotatable crystal holder capable of carrying more than one wafer. The crystal holder is usually heated from the backside to temperatures of 500 to 700 ¬∞C. Most setups also have RHEED equipment for the in-situ monitoring of surface superstructures on the growing surface and for measuring growth rates, and mass spectrometers for the analysis of the molecular species in the beams and the analysis of the residual gases. The gas inlet system, which is one of the most important components of the system, controls the material beam flux. Pressure controlled systems are used most commonly. The material flux is controlled by the input pressure of the gas injection capillary. The pressure inside the chamber can be measured and controlled by a capacitance manometer. The molecular beams of gaseous source materials injectors or effusion jets that ensure a homogeneous beam profile. For some starting compounds, such as the hydrides that are the group V starting material, the hydrides have to be precracked into the injector. This is usually done by thermally decomposing with a heated metal or filament.  Growth kinetics  In order to better understand the growth kinetics associated with CBE, it is important to look at physical and chemical processes associated with MBE and MOCVD as well. Figure 2 depicts those. The growth kinetics for these three techniques differ in many ways. In conventional MBE, the growth rate is determined by the arrival rate of the group III atomic beams. The epitaxial growth takes place as the group III atoms impinge on the heated substrate surface, migrates into the appropriate lattice sites and then deposits near excess group V dimers or tetramers. It is worth noting that no chemical reaction is involved at the surface since the atoms are generated by thermal evaporation from solid elemental sources. Figure 2: Growth kinetics involved in a) conventional MBE, b) MOCVD, and c) CBE. In MOCVD, group III alkyls are already partially dissociated in the gas stream. These diffuse through a stagnant boundary layer that exists over the heated substrate, after which they dissociate into the atomic group III elements. These atoms then migrate to the appropriate lattice site and deposit epitaxially by associating with a group V atom that was derived from the thermal decomposition of the hydrides. The growth rate here is usually limited by the diffusion rate of the group III alkyls through the boundary layer. Gas phase reactions between the reactants have also been observed in this process. In CBE processes, the hydrides are cracked in a high temperature injector before they reach the substrate. The temperatures are typically 100-150 ¬∞C lower than they are in a similar MOCVD or MOVPE. There is also no boundary layer (such as the one in MOCVD) and molecular collisions are minimal due to the low pressure. The group V alkyls are usually supplied in excess, and the group III alkyl molecules impinge directly onto the heated substrate as in conventional MBE. The group III alkyl molecule has two options when this happens. The first option is to dissociate its three alkyl radicals by acquiring thermal energy from the surface, and leaving behind the elemental group III atoms on the surface. The second option is to re-evaporate partially or completely undissociated. Thus, the growth rate is determined by the arrival rate of the group III alkyls at a higher substrate temperature, and by the surface pyrolysis rate at lower temperatures.  Compatibility with device fabrication = Selective growth at low temperatures  Selective growth through dielectric masking is readily achieved using CBE as compared to its parent techniques of MBE and MOCVD. Selective growth is hard to achieve using elemental source MBE because group III atoms do not desorb readily after they are adsorbed. With chemical sources, the reactions associated with the growth rate are faster on the semiconductor surface than on the dielectric layer. No group III element can, however, arrive at the dielectric surface in CBE due to the absence of any gas phase reactions. Also, it is easier for the impinging group III metalorganic molecules to desorb in the absence of the boundary layer. This makes it easier to perform selective epitaxy using CBE and at lower temperatures, compared to MOCVD or MOVPE. In recent developments patented by ABCD Technology, substrate rotation is no longer required, leading to new possibilities such as in-situ patterning with particle beams.G. Benvenuti,Large area deposition in high vacuum with high thickness uniformity. WO_2003093529_A2[1]. This possibility opens very interesting perspectives to achieve patterned thin films in a single step, in particular for materials that are difficult to etch such as oxides.  p-type doping  It was observed that using TMGa for the CBE of GaAs led to high p-type background doping (1020 cm‚àí3) due to incorporated carbon. However, it was found that using TEGa instead of TMGa led to very clean GaAs with room temperature hole concentrations between 1014 and 1016 cm‚àí3. It has been demonstrated that the hole concentrations can be adjusted between 1014 and 1021 cm‚àí3 by just adjusting the alkyl beam pressure and the TMGa/TEGa ratio, providing means for achieving high and controllable p-type doping of GaAs. This has been exploited for fabricating high quality heterojunction bipolar transistors.  Advantages and disadvantages  CBE offers many other advantages over its parent techniques of MOCVD and MBE, some of which are listed below:  Advantages over MBE  # Easier multiwafer scaleup: Substrate rotation is required for uniformity in thickness and conformity since MBE has individual effusion cells for each element. Large effusion cells and efficient heat dissipation make multiwafer scaleup more difficult. # Better for production environment: Instant flux response due to precision electronic control flow. # Absence of oval defects: These oval defects generally arise from micro-droplets of Ga or In spit out from high temperature effusion cells. These defects vary in size and density system-to-system and time-to-time.M.A. Herman and H. Sitter. Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Heidelberg: Springer, 1996. # Lower drifts in effusion conditions that do not depend on effusive source filling. # In recent developments patented by ABCD Technology, substrate rotation is no longer required.  Advantages over MOCVD  # Easy implementation of in-situ diagnostic instruments such as RHEED. # Compatibility with other high vacuum thin-film processing methods, such as metal evaporation and ion implantation.  Shortcomings of CBE  # More pumping required compared to MOCVD. # Composition control can be difficult when growing GaInAs. At high temperature, we have a better incorporation of Ga, but we face the problem related desorption of In. So, a compromise should be found between high and low temperature for a good composition control. # High carbon incorporation for GaAlAs.

She took her name from Crown Prince Wilhelm, son of the German Emperor Wilhelm II, and was a sister ship of . She had a varied career, starting off as a world-record- holding passenger liner, then becoming an auxiliary warship from 1914‚Äì1915 for the Imperial German Navy, sailing as a commerce raider for a year, and then interned in the United States when she ran out of supplies.

State visit of 1902 Parcel Post stamp issued in 1912 In 1902, Prince Heinrich of Prussia (1862‚Äì1929)‚Äîbrother of Kaiser Wilhelm II‚Äîmade a state visit to New York, where he was received by President Theodore Roosevelt. Media-oriented, he sailed on the new, impressive Kronprinz Wilhelm, on which a huge number of reporters could accompany him, and not the imperial yacht. There were also 300 passengers and 700 steerage passengers aboard. This state visit was also an early example of film reporting. This was also the ship's first voyage under Captain August Richter, who was the captain until August 1907. German auxiliary cruiser (1914‚Äì1915) When Germany entered World War I, Kronprinz Wilhelm was on the western side of the Atlantic, under the command of Captain Grahn. She was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy, and ordered to rendezvous with to take on two rapid-firing guns, 290 rounds of 88 mm ammunition, a machine gun, and 36 rifles as well as one officer, two non-commissioned officers, and 13 ratings. She was commissioned as an auxiliary cruiser. Lieutenant Commander (Kapitanleutnant) Paul Thierfelder‚Äîformerly Karlsruhes navigation officer‚Äîbecame her commander, and Grahn was made 1st Officer. The close proximity of the British cruiser abbreviated the rendezvous, forcing the two German ships to cast off hastily and speed away in different directions. Kronprinz Wilhelm took a meandering course towards the Azores, arriving on 17 August and rendezvousing with the German steamer off S√£o Miguel Island. Provisioning and training Pre-WWI view of Kronprinz Wilhelm Walhalla and Kronprinz Wilhelm headed south from the Azores, while transferring coal from Walhalla to Kronprinz Wilhelm.William Lowell Putnam: The Kaiser's merchant ships in World War I. McFarland & Company, Inc. Publishers, Jefferson 2001. . p. 74. She then learned from German representatives at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands that no further coal would be available in the neighborhood of the Azores and the Canaries. Consequently, her commanding officer decided to head for the Brazilian coast, where he hoped to find sources of coal more friendly to Germany or at least a greater choice of neutral ports in which to intern his ship if she should find herself unable to replenish her supplies from captured ships. During the voyage to the Azores and thence to the South American coast, Kronprinz Wilhelm had to avoid contact with all shipping since she was not ready to embark upon her mission raiding Allied commerce. The guns had to be emplaced and a target for gunnery practice constructed. The crew‚Äîmostly reservists and civilians‚Äîreceived a crash course in their duties in a warship and in general naval discipline. A \\"prize crew\\" was selected and trained in the techniques of boarding captured vessels (prizes), inspecting cargo and ship's papers, and using explosive charges to sink captured ships. Finally, all members of the crew were outfitted in some semblance of a naval uniform. The crew worked at a feverish pace in order to be ready, and by the time Kronprinz Wilhelm met Karlsruhes tender‚ÄîSS Asuncion‚Äînear Rocas Reef north of Cape San Roque on 3 September, preparations were nearly complete. At 20:30 the following evening, the auxiliary cruiser encountered a target, the British steamer . The merchantman stopped without the raider's firing a shot. Heavy seas, however, postponed the boarding until shortly after 06:00 the following morning. The prize crew found a cargo composed largely of contraband, but before sinking the ship, Commander Thierfelder wanted to salvage as much of her supplies and fuel as he could. Continued heavy seas precluded the transfer until the afternoon of 8 September. Indian Princes crew and passengers were brought over to Kronprinz Wilhelm at around 14:00, and the two ships moved alongside each other immediately thereafter. Coaling started and continued throughout the night of 8/9 September. The following morning, the German prize crew detonated three explosive charges which sank Indian Prince. Kronprinz Wilhelm then headed south to rendezvous with several German supply ships. Coal, more than any other factor, proved to be the key to the success of Kronprinz Wilhelms cruise. The hope of finding that commodity had brought her to the coast of South America, and her success in locating sources of it kept her there. Initially, she replenished from German steamers sent out of South American ports specifically for that purpose. She spent the next month coaling from four such auxiliaries before she even contacted her next victim. That event occurred on 7 October, when she hailed the British steamer well off the Brazilian coast at about the same latitude as Rio de Janeiro. The next day, the raider went alongside the captured ship to seize the prize's coal and cargo of frozen meat before sinking her. She took La Correntinas two ammunition-less guns and their splinter shields. The raider later mounted the additional guns aft, where they were used for gun drills and to fire warning shots with modified, blank salute cartridges. She continued coaling and provisioning operations from La Correntina until 11 October, when bad weather forced a postponement. On 14 October, she resumed the transfer of fuel but broke off again when she intercepted a wireless message indicating that her captive's sister ship had departed Montevideo two days earlier and would soon pass nearby. The prize crew placed the usual three explosive charges, and sank La Correntina that same day. Survivors of La Correntina and the French barque Union were landed at Montevideo by the German liner on 23 November 1914. During the ensuing five months, Kronprinz Wilhelm cruised the waters off the coast of Brazil and Argentina. Allied newspapers often reported that Kronprinz Wilhelm had been sunk, torpedoed, or interned, but between 4 September 1914 and 28 March 1915, she was responsible for the capture (and often sinking) of 15 ships‚Äî10 British, four French, and one Norwegian‚Äîoff the east coast of South America. Thirteen of them sank from direct actions of Kronprinz Wilhelm; another she damaged severely by ramming, and she probably sank later. The remaining ship served as a lumpensammler, transporting into port what had become an unbearable number of detainees on board after her 12th capture. Methods of capture Ships were usually captured either by Kronprinz Wilhelm simply overtaking them with superior speed and size, ordering them to stop, and then sending over a boarding party, or by pretending to be a ship in distress or posing as a ship of a friendly nationality and luring unsuspecting prey to her in that way. The targeted ships were usually caught by surprise (some did not even yet know that war had been declared), and their captain had to make the quick decision of whether to run, fight, or surrender. Since the captured ships were no match in speed, and usually had few or no arms, the unpleasant but expedient choice was to surrender. Kronprinz Wilhelm would send over a boarding party to search the captured vessel. If it appeared to have nothing of value or military significance, it was released and sent on its way. If it did have valuable (or contraband) cargo, or was a warship or a ship that might someday be converted to military use, the crew of Kronprinz Wilhelm would then systematically (and quite politely) transfer all of the crew, passengers, and their baggage and other valuable cargo from the captured ship to their own, including coal and other supplies. Then they would usually scuttle the captured vessel by opening up the seacocks (valves in the hull below the waterline), thereby causing the captured ship to fill with water after small charges were detonated, and sink. Throughout the entire journey, not a single life was lost.

However, Kronprinz Wilhelms commander chose to be cautious, and believing it to be a trap, steamed away without attacking the severely damaged Carmania. Late in March 1915, the auxiliary cruiser headed north to rendezvous with another German supply ship at the equator. She arrived at the meeting point on the morning of 28 March and cruised in the neighborhood all day. That evening, she sighted a steamer in company with two British warships distant. Though Kronprinz Wilhelm did not know it at the time, she had just witnessed the capture of her supply ship‚ÄîSS Macedonia‚Äîby two British cruisers. The raider steamed around in the general vicinity for several days, but the passage of each succeeding day further diminished her hopes of a successful rendezvous. 1915‚Äì1917 internment SMS Kronprinz Wilhelm, still flying the German naval ensign, interned in a U.S. port, April 1915. Finally, a dwindling coal supply and an alarming increase in the sick list forced Kronprinz Wilhelm to make for the nearest neutral port. The apparent cause of the illness was malnutrition from their diet consisting mainly of beef, white bread, boiled potatoes, canned vegetables, and oleomargarine. The few fresh vegetables they seized from the captured vessels were reserved for the officers' mess. Dr. Perrenon‚Äîthe ship's surgeon‚Äîis reported to have said, \\"We had many cases of pneumonia, pleurisy and rheumatism among the men. They seemed to lose all resistance long before the epidemic broke out. We had superficial wounds, cuts, to deal with. They usually refused to heal for a long time. We had much hemorrhage. There were a number of accidents aboard, fractures, and dislocations. The broken bones were slow to mend.\\" Slow healing is an early symptom of scurvy. Early in the morning of 11 April 1915, she stopped off Cape Henry, Virginia, and took on a pilot. At 10:12 that morning, she dropped anchor off Newport News, and ended her cruise, during which she steamed and destroyed just under of Allied shipping. She and her crew were interned, the ship was laid up at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, and her crew lived in a camp nearby, as \\"guests\\". During their internment, the crews of these vessels‚Äînumbering about 1,000 officers and men‚Äîbuilt in the yard‚Äîfrom scrap materials‚Äîa typical German village named \\"Eitel Wilhelm\\", which attracted many visitors. USS Von Steuben (1917‚Äì1919) \\"dazzle\\" camouflage pattern, alongside a pier at New York City, 28 June 1918. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war upon the German Empire. That same day, the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia seized the former German raider in the name of the U.S. On 22 May, President Woodrow Wilson issued the executive order which empowered the United States Navy to take possession of the ship and to begin to repair her. The internees became prisoners of war and were transferred to Fort McPherson, Georgia. On 9 June, Kronprinz Wilhelm was renamed Von Steuben (ID-3017) in honor of Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the German hero of the American Revolution, and commissioned in the United States Navy at Philadelphia, with Commander Stanford E. Moses in command. The name Kronprinz Wilhelm was reclaimed by the German navy in 1918 when it renamed its battleship SMS Kronprinz as SMS Kronprinz Wilhelm. This ship was scuttled in June 1919 with the remainder of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. Sailing history as U.S. vessel The newly named Von Steuben began her American Navy career as an auxiliary cruiser. Through the summer of 1917, her crew and workers at the Philadelphia Navy Yard prepared her to resume that role against her former masters. However, since the Allied and associated Powers already maintained virtual control of the seas, their need for that type of ship was minimal. Accordingly, on 21 September, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations telegraphed an order to the Commandant, Philadelphia Navy Yard, to assign her to transport duty upon completion of repairs to meet a more pressing need‚Äîthe transportation of troops and supplies to Europe. The ship completed preparations by 29 September and put to sea that same day for her first voyage. During the next four weeks, she remained close to American Eastern Seaboard, visiting Hampton Roads, Virginia and New York City in addition to Philadelphia. From left to right: USS Mount Vernon, USS Agamemnon, and USS Von Steuben in the North Atlantic, 10 November 1917. Note the damage to the bow of Von Steuben after her collision with Agamemnon. On 31 October, she stood out of New York for her first transatlantic voyage under the American flag with 1,223 troops and passengers bound for Brest, France. At about 06:05 on the morning of 9 November, Von Steuben received some damage during a collision with the troop ship . Both ships lost men overboard, and a few received injuries. In addition, two of her guns and one of her guns were damaged. Though her bow was opened to the sea, Von Steuben maintained while the damage control party made repairs. The ship continued on with the convoy and arrived in Brest three days later. She disembarked passengers and unloaded cargo between 14 and 19 November, but she did not depart until 28 November. Aftermath of the Halifax explosion On her way back to the U.S., Von Steuben diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia for coal. At about 09:14 on the morning of 6 December, she was about from Halifax when the ship was rocked by a concussion so severe that many thought she had struck a mine or been torpedoed. Lookouts spied a great flame and a high column of smoke in the direction of the port where the French ammunition ship had exploded in Halifax Harbour. Von Steuben learned the facts when she entered the harbor at about 14:30 that afternoon. A portion of the city had been devastated by the explosion and the tsunami which followed causing the death of 2,000 in the Halifax Explosion (the largest man-made accidental explosion up to that time). The ship responded to the emergency by landing officers and men to patrol the city and assist in rescue efforts. The transport remained at Halifax until 10 December, and then continued her voyage back to Philadelphia where she arrived on 13 December. Troop transport After debarking her passengers, Von Steuben got underway from Philadelphia again on 15 December. She coaled at Newport News on 16 December and remained there until 20 December. On 20 December, Captain Yates Stirling, Jr. assumed command of the transport from Commander Moses and she returned to sea, bound for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she disembarked marines. On 27 December, she got underway for the Panama Canal Zone. The ship transited the canal on 29 December and entered the drydock at Balboa, Panama that afternoon. Over the next three weeks, she received repairs of the damage to her bow. On 20 January 1918, the ship floated out of the dock and then retransited the canal. After coaling at Col√≥n, Panama, she departed the Canal Zone and headed back to the east coast. From 28‚Äì31 January, Von Steuben stopped at Newport News where she took on two new 5-inch guns and a 3-inch gun to replace those damaged in the collision with Agamemnon. On 1 February, she returned to Philadelphia to resume duty transporting troops to France. On 10 February, Von Steuben stood down the Delaware River with another convoy. She reached her destination, Brest, without incident on 24 February, unloaded her troops and cargo, and set out on the return voyage five days later. At about 16:20 on 5 March, a lookout spotted an object to port which resembled a submarine periscope. The alarm brought gun crews scurrying to their action stations, and they opened fire immediately. Before anyone realized that they were firing upon an innocuous piece of flotsam, a tragic accident occurred. The shell from one of her 5-inch guns exploded immediately upon leaving the barrel, and fragments struck three sailors. One died instantly, and the other two succumbed to their wounds later that night. Von Steuben coaled at Bermuda on 12‚Äì13 March and arrived at Norfolk on 16 March. After repairs and coaling, she moved on to Philadelphia to load troops and cargo for her third voyage to France. Encounter with U-151 Her next two voyages to France and back were uneventful, as was the New York-to-Brest leg of the following one. However, on the return voyage, she encountered a U-boat. At about 12:30 on the afternoon of 18 June, one of her lookouts reported wreckage ahead. As she steamed closer, seven small boats under sail came into sight on the port bow about away. Von Steuben began a zigzag approach to pick up what appeared to be boatloads of survivors from a sunken Allied ship. About 20 minutes later, her lookouts reported the wake of a torpedo approaching her bow from abaft the port beam. The gun crews manned their stations and began firing at the torpedo while Captain Stirling ordered the wheel hard to starboard and all engines full astern in an effort to avoid the torpedo. Meanwhile, some of the gunners had shifted their attention to what they thought to be the periscope of , the source of the torpedo bearing down upon Von Steuben. The ship's efforts to slow down and turn away from the torpedo were successful. It passed a few yards ahead of the ship, and Von Steuben delivered a depth-charge barrage which subjected the submarine to a severe shaking. Stirling's evasive maneuver was considered unorthodox and conventional practice at the time would have been to attempt to outrun the torpedo. For his actions in saving the ship and the lives aboard, he was subsequently awarded the Navy Cross and the French Legion of Honor. The real losers in that brief, but sharp, exchange were the survivors of the British steamer adrift in those seven small boats. U-151 had sunk their ship earlier and remained in the area to use them as bait for other Allied ships such as Von Steuben. The possibility that they were simply decoys and that other submarines might be lurking about forced the ship to continue on without further investigation. That decision was further reinforced by the fact that the boats appeared empty. Credit for this must go to Dwinsks master, who ordered his people to lie low in their craft so that other Allied ships would not be drawn into the waiting U-boat's trap. Fortunately, he and his men were saved eventually. Von Steuben arrived in New York on 20 June and began preparations for another voyage to France. On 29 June, she embarked troops for passage to Europe, and the next day formed up with a convoy for the Atlantic crossing. At about noon on the third day out, a fire broke out in the forward cargo hold of . As the blaze grew in intensity, the transfer of the troops embarked became a necessary precaution, and Von Steuben approached the burning ship. Silhouetted by the flames, she would have made a perfect target for any U-boat in the vicinity, but she worked throughout the night and, by morning, had succeeded in embarking Hendersons more than 2,000 troops. Henderson came about and made it safely back to the U.S., while Von Steuben completed a somewhat cramped voyage at Brest on 9 July. Three days later, she headed back across the Atlantic with civilians and wounded soldiers returning to the U.S. after service in Europe. After a peaceful voyage, the transport reached New York on 21 July. After a short repair period in late July and early August, the ship resumed duty transporting troops to Europe. On 8 September 1918, Captain Yates Stirling, Jr. transferred command to Captain Cyrus R. Miller. Between late August and the Armistice on 11 November, Von Steuben made three more round-trip voyages carrying troops to France and returning the sick and wounded to the U.S. Though all three were peaceful passages by wartime standards, they were not uneventful. On the return voyage from the first of the three, she weathered a severe hurricane during which three of her complement were washed overboard and lost at sea, while several others received injuries. During the New York-to-Brest leg of the second, the influenza epidemic of 1918 struck the 2,700 troops she had embarked and resulted in 400 stretcher cases and 34 deaths. Von Steuben arriving at New York on 1 September 1919, bringing home from France soldiers of the First Division Headquarters Von Steuben returned to New York from her ninth wartime voyage on 8 November. On 10 November, she began repairs at the Morse Dry Dock & Repair Company, Brooklyn, New York. The next day, Germany signed the armistice which ended hostilities. The former commerce raider completed repairs on 2 March 1919 and put to sea to begin bringing troops home from France. She continued to serve the Navy until 13 October 1919 when she was decommissioned and turned over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB). 1919‚Äì1923 commercial service Although her name was struck from the Navy List on 14 October 1919, for almost five years the ship continued to serve the United States under the auspices of the USSB, first as Baron Von Steuben and after 1921 simply as Von Steuben again. Her name disappeared from mercantile records after 1923 and she was scrapped by Boston Iron & Metals Co.

Commercial organizations use mathematics in accounting, inventory management, marketing, sales forecasting, and financial analysis. Mathematics typically used in commerce includes elementary arithmetic, elementary algebra, statistics and probability. For some management problems, more advanced mathematics - such as calculus, matrix algebra and linear programming - is applied. High school Business mathematics, sometimes called commercial math or consumer math, is a group of practical subjects used in commerce and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education. In the United States, they are typically offered in high schools and in schools that grant associate's degrees; elsewhere they may be included under Business studies. The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practice being predominant. A (U.S.) business math course typically include a review of elementary arithmetic, including fractions, decimals, and percentages. Elementary algebra is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include checking accounts, price discounts, markups and Markup, payroll calculations, simple and compound interest, consumer and business credit, and mortgages and revenues. University level=Undergraduate \\"Business Mathematics\\" comprises mathematics courses taken at an undergraduate level by business students. The two most common here are Business Calculus and Business Statistics. Programs often also cover matrix operations as mentioned above, and may include a separate module on interest calculations. These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study trigonometric functions, courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields. (Although see Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Bachelor of Business Science.) Note that economics majors, especially those planning to pursue graduate study in the field, are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as linear algebra and other advanced math courses, especially real analysis. Some economics programs (instead) include a module in \\"mathematics for economists\\", providing a bridge between the above \\"Business Mathematics\\" courses and mathematical economics and econometrics. Operations management (and management accounting) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization techniques. Postgraduate At the postgraduate level, generalist management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually \\"interest mathematics\\" and statistics, both at the above level. MBA programs often also include basic operations research (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as \\"quantitative analysis\\"; MSF programs may similarly cover applied econometrics. More technical Masters in these areas, such as those in management science and quantitative finance, will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as mathematical optimization and stochastic calculus. These programs do not include or entail \\"Business mathematics\\" per se. Where mathematical economics is not a degree requirement, graduate economics programs often include \\"quantitative techniques\\", which covers (applied) linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and optimization, and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

Every summer the play \\"The Miracle Worker\\" is produced for the public to view on the original Keller homesite. The water pump at which Helen rediscovered language is used as a prop in the play. Other area attractions include the Wilson Dam, the Zodiac Theater located in downtown Florence, and a Robert Trent Jones golf course. The Shoals is also noted for its rich music traditions and is sometimes referred to as the birthplace of the Blues because W.C. Handy is credited by many as the father of the Blues. Since the 1970s, 80s, and to some extent even today, The Shoals has been home to a thriving recording industry, particularly based on the sensational output of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. In the FAME Studios, Dan Penn, Spooner Oldham, Chips Moman, and Rick Hall made soul music including the hit song by Percy Sledge, \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\". Rock groups and musicians including The Rolling Stones, Julian Lennon and Lynyrd Skynyrd have recorded there.

Hornibrook's delivery Career Hornibrook made his first class debut in 1919‚Äì20 against Victoria, taking four wickets. In 1920‚Äì21 he took 3‚Äì89 for Queensland against the touring English side. He was selected for the Australian side which toured New Zealand in 1921 and took 47 first class wickets at an average of 12. According to Wisden, \\"Many thought he should have been included in the 1921 side to England, which was distinctly weak in slow-wicket bowling, though in the event it not require it.\\"Percy Hornibrook Wisden profile Wisden later said \\"There was far greater surprise when he was omitted from the 1926 side, and no less a judge than M. A. Noble advocated his inclusion. He would at least have saved Macartney from being bowled to death in the early weeks of the tour and in the vital last Test on a rain-affected pitch he might easily have tipped the scales in Australia's favour.\\" Hornibrook made his test debut in the last game of the 1928‚Äì29 Ashes. He took four wickets and made some useful runs in Australia's victory. In 1929‚Äì30 he took 35 first class wickets at an average of 32. 1930 Ashes Hornibrook toured Australia for the 1930 Ashes. He played in all the tests and took 13 wickets in tests. He took 96 wickets on the tour in all, Australia's second best bowler after Clarrie Grimmett. Hornibrook's best performance came in the 5th test. The series was 1‚Äì1, with England only having to draw to retain the Ashes. They batted first and scored 405, with Hornibrook taking no wickets. Australia batted and made 695. When England batted again Hornibrook took 7‚Äì92 and England were dismissed for 251. According to Wisden, \\"his figures suggest, what good critics confirm, that he bowled far too many bad balls: one indeed said that bogey for a good slow left-hander on that wicket would have been seven for 30. Perhaps had he had longer experience of English conditions he would have been better. At any rate by then he was past his peak‚Äîhis arm had dropped and he was more full-chested. At the end of the tour he retired from first-class cricket.\\" He played one Sheffield Shield game in 1930‚Äì31 and made a comeback to first class cricket in 1933‚Äì34. It was not successful but he continued to play club cricket for Toombul District Cricket Club. Hornibrook retired from club cricket in 1940.

A member of the Minnesota Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party (DFL), she represented portions of the city of Minneapolis for 44 years. On August 9, 2016, Ilhan Omar defeated Kahn in the DFL primary for District 60B. Education and career Kahn received a B.A. in physics from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in biophysics from Yale University. She later received an M.P.A. from Harvard University. She is a retired professor of biophysics. Political career She was the chief author and advocate of the 1975 Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act, one of the first laws enacted anywhere in the world banning the smoking of tobacco in public places. This law has been used as a template for later legislation to protect the public from \\"secondhand smoke,\\" and was updated and expanded in 2005. In 1989, Kahn proposed reducing the voting age in Minnesota to 12. She said \\"history has shown us that when a segment of society is denied the right to vote, all the rights of that segment of society are then inferior.\\" Kahn has also repeatedly advocated for repeal of so-called \\"Blue Laws,\\" which forbid liquor stores from operating on Sundays and some holidays. In 2003 she introduced a bill to repeal the ban on first-cousin marriage in Minnesota, but it died in committee. Republican Minority Leader Marty Seifert criticized the bill in response, saying it would \\"turn us into a cold Arkansas.\\"TPT St. Paul. \\"Quotes for Inspiration.\\" June 25, 2009. According to the University of Minnesota's The Wake, Kahn was aware the bill had little chance of passing but introduced it anyway to draw attention to the issue. She reportedly got the idea after learning that cousin marriage is an acceptable form of marriage among some cultural groups that have a strong presence in Minnesota, namely the Hmong and Somali. She is a longtime advocate for education, health care and medical technology, agriculture and the natural environment, and human rights, particularly for senior citizens and women. Minnesota House of Representatives Kahn was first elected to represent her area of Minneapolis in 1972 and served continuously from then until January 2017. In the August 2016 DFL primary election for District 60B, Kahn finished third of three candidates, so her name was not on the November 2016 ballot. Personal life In 2004, Kahn was charged with theft for removal of Republican campaign literature from doorsteps of several houses. She pleaded guilty and paid a $200 fine. Kahn was a leading opponent of efforts by DeLaSalle High School in Minneapolis to construct an athletic field on its campus in her neighborhood on Nicollet Island, giving her views frequently at public hearings. Ultimately, the school was allowed to build the field. Kahn was married to University of Minnesota mathematics professor Donald Kahn for 58 years, until his death in January 2015.

The liability is said to be strict because defendants could be convicted even though they were genuinely ignorant of one or more factors that made their acts or omissions criminal. The defendants may therefore not be culpable in any real way, i.e. there is not even criminal negligence, the least blameworthy level of mens rea. Strict liability laws were created in the 19th century to improve working and safety standards in factories. Needing to prove mens reas on the part of the factory owners was very difficult and resulted in very few prosecutions. The creation of strict liability offenses meant that convictions were increased. Common strict liability offenses today include the selling of alcohol to underage persons and statutory rape. These laws are applied either in regulatory offenses enforcing social behaviour where minimal stigma attaches to a person upon conviction, or where society is concerned with the prevention of harm, and wishes to maximise the deterrent value of the offense. The imposition of strict liability may operate very unfairly in individual cases. For example, in Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Storkwain,Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Storkwain [1986] UKHL 13, [1986] 2 All ER 635 a pharmacist supplied drugs to a patient who presented a forged doctor's prescription, but was convicted even though the House of Lords accepted that the pharmacist was blameless. The justification is that the misuse of drugs is a grave social evil and pharmacists should be encouraged to take even unreasonable care to verify prescriptions before supplying drugs. Similarly, where liability is imputed or attributed to another through vicarious liability or corporate liability, the effect of that imputation may be strict liability albeit that, in some cases, the accused will have a mens rea imputed and so, in theory, will be as culpable as the actual wrongdoer. In various jurisdictions=Australia The Australian Criminal Code Act of 1995 defines strict liability and absolute liability in division 6. Recent work health and safety legislation creates strict liability for WHS offenses. Also, certain other industrial offenses such as pollution tend to be enacted in terms of strict liability. Most air safety regulations in regard to operators of aircraft and unmanned rockets are enacted as strict liability offenses. Canada Since 1978, Canadian criminal law has recognized a distinction between offenses of \\"strict\\" and \\"absolute\\" liability. In R. v. City of Sault Ste-Marie the Supreme Court of Canada created a two-tiered system of liability for regulatory offenses. Under this system, the Crown would continue to be relieved from proving the mens rea of the offense. However, offenses of strict liability would grant the accused a defense of due diligence‚Äîwhich would continue to be denied in cases of absolute liability. Further, in the absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary, the Court held that all regulatory offences would be presumed to bear strict liability. Following the enactment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, this distinction was upheld in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act. The Supreme Court further held that the inclusion of the possibility of imprisonment‚Äîno matter how remote‚Äîin an offense of absolute liability violated the accused's Section 7 right to liberty.  English law  Under the common law the rule is that crimes require proof of mens rea except in cases of public nuisance, criminal libel, blasphemous libel, outraging public decency and criminal contempt of court. Where the liability arises under a statute, there has been considerable inconsistency, with different rules of construction in statutory interpretation producing varying assessments of the will of Parliament. But, in Sweet v Parsley, Lord Reid laid down the following guidelines for all cases where the offense is criminal as opposed to quasi-criminal: #Wherever a section is silent as to mens rea there is a presumption that, in order to give effect to the will of Parliament, words importing mens rea must be read into the provision. #It is a universal principle that if a penal provision is reasonably capable of two interpretations, that interpretation which is most favourable to the accused must be adopted. #The fact that other sections of the Act expressly require mens rea is not in itself sufficient to justify a decision that a section which is silent as to mens rea creates an absolute offense. It is necessary to go outside the Act and examine all relevant circumstances in order to establish that this must have been the intention of Parliament. Hence, the literal rule is qualified, and there is a rebuttable presumption that Parliament intended a mens rea to be a requirement in any section which creates an offense where the social stigma following conviction and the punishment available to be imposed show this to be a truly criminal offense. In Gammon v A-G (Hong Kong), Lord Scarman rebutted the presumption because public safety was threatened.Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney-General of Hong Kong [1984] UKPC 17 Hence, statutes involving pollution, dangerous drugs, and acting as a director while disqualified have been interpreted as imposing strict liability. In National Rivers Authority v Empress Car Co,Environment Agency (formerly National Rivers Authority) v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd [1998] UKHL 5 examples are given of cases in which strict liability has been imposed for \\"causing\\" events which were the immediate consequence of the deliberate acts of third parties but which the defendant had a duty to prevent or take reasonable care to prevent. If words like \\"knowingly\\" or \\"wilfully\\" appear in the section, the inference is that Parliament intended a mens rea requirement in that section. But, if words implying a mens rea are present in some sections but not others, this suggests that Parliament deliberately excluded a mens rea requirement in those sections which are silent. In considering offenses created in the Children Act 1960, Lord Hutton in B (a minor) v DPP (2000), states the current position: :the test is not whether it is a reasonable implication that the statute rules out mens rea as a constituent part of the crime‚Äîthe test is whether it is a necessary implication.B v Director of Public Prosecutions (2000) 1 All ER 833, 855 As to the meaning of \\"necessary implication\\", Lord Nicholls said :Necessary implication connotes an implication that is compellingly clear. Such an implication can be found in the language used, the nature of the offense, the mischief sought to be prevented and any other circumstances which may assist in determining what intention is properly to be attributed to Parliament when creating the offense. Necessary implication may arise from not only the statutory provision under review but also from the rules governing that provision to be deduced from other provisions. Thus, the court must examine the overall purpose of the statute. If the intention is to introduce quasi- criminal offenses, strict liability will be acceptable to give quick penalties to encourage future compliance, e.g. fixed-penalty parking offenses. But, if the policy issues involved are sufficiently significant and the punishments more severe, the test must be whether reading in a mens rea requirement will defeat Parliament's intention in creating the particular offense, i.e. if defendants might escape liability too easily by pleading ignorance, this would not address the \\"mischief\\" that Parliament was attempting to remedy. =Sexual Offences Act 2003= In R. v. G. (2005), a 15-year-old boy was convicted of statutory rape of a child under 13, a crime under Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The prosecution accepted the boy's claim that he had believed the 12-year-old girl to be 15, but he was nevertheless sentenced to 12 months' detention. This was reduced on appeal to a conditional discharge, but, in a 3‚Äì2 decision, the House of Lords declined to reverse the conviction. Germany In Germany, strict liability does not exist today since it is not consistent with the \\"nulla poena sine culpa\\" principle (no punishment without guilt).Rogall, ZStW 1986 (98), 579 Strict liability existed in the German Reich, e.g. ¬ß 18 Wechselstempelgesetz, ¬ß 95 Reichsstempelgesetz.Rogall, ZStW 1986 (98), 579. United States As the federal constitution entrenches a right of due process, the United States usually applies strict liability to only the most minor crimes or infractions. One example is a parking violation, where the state only needs to show that the defendant's vehicle was parked inappropriately at a certain curb. Serious crimes like rape and murder usually require some showing of culpability or mens rea. Otherwise, every accidental death, even during medical treatment in good faith, could become grounds for a murder prosecution and a prison sentence. A serious offense in which strict liability tends to show up is in drunk driving laws; the punishment tends to be given on a strict liability basis, with no mens rea requirement at all. This was important for the purposes of a U.S. Supreme Court case in 2004, Leocal v. Ashcroft, where a deportation order was overturned because the conviction that led to the deportation order was a strict liability law, while deportation was only allowed upon conviction if the crime was a \\"crime of violence\\" (where violence, or the potential for it, was inherent in the crime itself). In many states, statutory rape is considered a strict liability offense. In these states, 22 , it is possible to face felony charges despite not knowing the age of the other person, or even if the minor presented identification showing an age of eighteen or higher. The American Law Institute's Model Penal Code generally restricts strict liability to minor offenses (\\"violations\\"). However, in United States v. KantorUnited States v. Kantor, 677 F. Supp. 1421 (C.D. Cal. 1987), aff'd sub nom, United States v. United States Dist. Court, 858 F.2d 534 (9th Cir. 1988), which concerned underage pornographic actress Traci Lords, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals introduced a \\"good faith\\" defense against crimes in which the victim intentionally tricked the defendants into a factual mistake thinking that no crime was being committed. A \\"good faith\\" defense requires showing that the defendant affirmatively had reason to believe that they were not committing a crime, not simply a lack of knowledge that they were.

At the 2006 census, Henty had a population of 863 people. History Henty Post Office The first European explorer to visit and record the area was Major Thomas Mitchell in 1835. The first settlers arrived around 1850 were squatters, allowed to lease crown land. The area was known as 'Dudal Comer', Aboriginal for 'Sweet Water', with the first property station taking this name. The village of Henty was originally called 'Doodle Cooma'. Nearby wetlands are still called Doodle Cooma Swamp; they cover 20 square kilometres and are a breeding area for water birds. The post office changed its name in 1886 as the railway station's name was thought to be confused with Cooma in the Monaro district. The town's new name was after the Henty family of Portland, Victoria and Launceston, Tasmania. Henry Henty had leased Round Hill station north of Gerogery (south of Henty) in the early 1860s (some suggest the lessor was Edward Henty). Sergeant Smyth Bushranger Dan 'Mad Dog' Morgan operated in the area for a time. Two kilometres west of the town on Pleasant Hills Rd (the Lockhart road) is a memorial stone near the site where Morgan shot Sergeant Thomas Smyth in September 1864. A more recent plaque has been erected by the NSW Police Service and reads: > \\"A memorial to Senior Sergeant Thomas Smyth, aged 29. A member of the NSW > Police Force shot by bushranger Dan Morgan in the surrounding hills on 4 > September 1864. Senior Sergeant Smyth received a gunshot wound to his left > shoulder and convalesced at the Imperial Hotel, Albury until 29 September > 1864 where he haemorrhaged as a result of the gunshot wound and died. He is > buried in an unmarked grave in the Albury cemetery. Dan Morgan was a > murderer with a ¬£1000 price on his head. Senior Sergeant Smyth gave his life > while in the pursuit of Morgan who although a tourist attraction these days > put fear in the people of the district in the 1860s.\\" Smyth had been in pursuit of Morgan, who was already wanted for several murders. It is reported that Morgan crept into Smyth's tent at night, and shot the sleeping Sergeant. German settlement and railway connection Henty railway station Doodle Cooma Arms Hotel Around 1868, many families of German extraction, following the Murray River, trekked from South Australia towards nearby Albury eventually settling in the Henty District. In 1880 the main railway line from Sydney to Albury passed the settlement. The first store opened in 1885 and a railway siding was constructed. In 1886, the Land Department authorised a survey of part of Doodle Cooma Station, changing the spelling from ‚ÄòDudal Comer‚Äô. Doodle Cooma Post Office opened on 16 December 1886 at the rail platform, and was renamed Henty in 1891. The village of Henty was named in 1888. The Doodle Cooma Arms Hotel was built in 1889. The first school was established in 1892. In 1895 'Government Dam' was excavated. The first police officer was appointed to the town in 1899. The Bank of New South Wales opened a branch in 1897. The bank was held up in 1901: the only bank robbery in Henty with both men captured ‚Äì one later died of wounds received during the hold-up. Combine harvester Old style harvester In 1914, a local farmer named Headlie Taylor invented the header harvester which revolutionised the grain industry worldwide when it became commercially available in 1916. The harvester was superior to previous harvesters as it could 'lift' the heads of damaged crops and collect grain that would otherwise be lost. It was also more efficient, cutting the wheat heads rather than beating or pulling them off. The new technology was more reliable and compact than the stripper harvester and was manufactured by the McKay Harvesting and Machinery Co of Sunshine, Victoria. The header harvester was of significant economic value for Australia as its huge harvesting capacity aided the trend of bulk handling of wheat in Australia. Depression years - \\"The Henty Man\\" During the time of the great depression it was common for itinerant workers to walk from town to town in search of work - these men (they were almost always men) were known at the time as \\"swaggies\\". One such worker is celebrated in the \\"Henty Man\\" tree, located on the Olympic Highway about 7 km south of the township. Although the original has since been replaced, the local folklore is that a \\"swaggie\\" painted the words, \\"Henty 5mi\\" onto a stump that resembled a pointing man. The stump was whitewashed, with gloves, boots, a belt, and a swag strap in black. The comical figure was later crowned by a tin top hat made by a local Blacksmith, Charles Schlue. The new \\"Henty Man\\" tree is a popular stopping point for visitors to the area and the figure is an icon of the town, featuring on many souvenirs of Henty. Recent history In 1998, Henty was the first town in New South Wales to open a community bank under the Bendigo Bank franchise. A rebuilt district hospital has opened in October 2004 and a retirement village was built in the town with approval for the project being given in late 2005. In 1986 the Henty Centenary Committee published From Early Beginnings. Henty NSW. Home of the Header. Centenary 1886 - 1986. In 2004 Henty held its centenary show.

Henty field days The Henty machinery field days are held on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the third week in September each year. Over 60,000 people visit the field days over the two-and-a-half-day period. There are over 600 exhibitors each year. It is one of the largest in Southern Australia and displays new agricultural equipment and technology for farmers. The first of these modern field days was held in 1963. The field days are now held at a permanent all-weather rural exhibition site with broad display avenues including a square kilometre (250 acres) of car parking however the on-site airstrip created in 1976 was later closed.

A version of Lyla Michaels appeared in The CW television series Arrow played by Audrey Marie Anderson as a recurring character. In the series, she is the director of A.R.G.U.S. and the wife of John Diggle (Arrowverse). Michaels was also a recurring character on The Flash television series. Anderson's character temporarily became a more faithful version of Harbinger for the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\".  Fictional character biography  An orphan whose ship sunk during a violent storm, Lyla Michaels was rescued from certain doom by the Monitor, a cosmic being locked in an eternal war against his anti-matter counterpart the Anti-Monitor. Raising Lyla as his assistant, the two monitored the multiverse's heroes and arranged for weapons and super-powered henchmen for various villains, to test heroes that the Monitor would recruit for his impending final battle against the Anti-Monitor. The Earth that Lyla was rescued from was Earth Prime (Marv Wolfman said when asked on Facebook about what Earth was she rescued from). When Crisis on Infinite Earths began, Lyla assumed the identity of \\"Harbinger\\" after entering a womb-like chamber which energized her and allowed her to create a series of doppelgangers in her new costume. These doppelgangers recruited a wide variety of heroes and villains to fight the Anti-Monitor's shadow demons and protect a series of vibration towers, designed to protect Earth 1 and Earth 2 from the wave of Anti-Matter destroying the DC Multiverse. However, while recruiting the hero Arion, a shadow demon merged with one of Harbinger's duplicates, allowing the Anti-Monitor to control her once her various doubles merged into a single entity. Under the Anti-Monitor's control, Lyla killed the Monitor. Monitor foresaw the Anti-Monitor's gambit and arranged to have his life force be the fuel to power up the vibration towers, saving Earths 1 and 2 from doom. The shock of what she did caused Lyla to revert to a version of her normal form, which then sacrificed all of her powers to save the last three alternate universe (home of the Freedom Fighters, the Charlton heroes, and the Captain Marvel family) from annihilation. When the five remaining universes merged, Harbinger suddenly regained her power in the process of time and space merging to create a new single universe DC Universe. Afterwards, Harbinger recorded the history of the Post-Crisis DC Universe into a computer satellite.History of the DC Universe #1-2 (1987) This led to the Millennium crossover, which had the satellite fall into the hands of the Manhunters, who used the data to confirm the identities of much of the Earth super-hero population as part of a greater plan to infiltrate the super-hero community. After the mini-series, Harbinger joined the New Guardians and was infected with the AIDS virus along with half the team. She reunited with fellow Monitor allies Pariah and Lady Quark during the War of the Gods crossover, after which she was offered membership with the Amazon tribe of Themyscira as the Amazons' official historian.War of the Gods #4 (1991) When Kara Zor-El, aka the original Supergirl, was discovered to exist in the Post-Crisis DC Universe and arrived on Earth, she was given shelter and lodgings on the island of Themyscira.Superman/Batman #9 (2004) Harbinger befriended Supergirl and remembering how she sacrificed her life during the original Crisis, Harbinger willingly died protecting Kara in a failed bid to prevent Darkseid from kidnapping her.Superman/Batman #10 (2004)  Donna Troy/Dark Angel Connection  During the events of the \\"Return of Donna Troy\\" mini-series, it was revealed that Donna Troy's arch enemy (and temporal doppelganger) Dark Angel served a similar role to Harbinger during the original Crisis before severing ties with the Anti-Monitor. Furthermore, the Titans of Myth revealed that Donna was a temporal anomaly thanks to the Crisis changing her and Wonder Woman's histories. The Titans, seeing potential in exploiting Donna's unconscious knowledge of the Pre-Crisis universe, rescued her as a child in order to manipulate her into becoming their own version of Harbinger. Following the events of the Infinite Crisis, Donna recorded a new version of the \\"History of the DC Universe\\" reflecting the changes in the timeline following Infinite Crisis. Meanwhile, a new incarnation of Harbinger, a genetically altered being called The Forerunner was introduced that was tasked with killing anyone who crossed over between universes for the Monitors.Countdown to Adventure #1 Harbinger was reanimated as a Black Lantern during the Blackest Night crossover. She uses her knowledge of history to provoke her targets by bringing up emotional memories, but is destroyed with the other Black Lanterns.R.E.B.E.L.S. #10 (2009) In Multiversity #1, the AI of the Monitor watchstation known as the House of Heroes refers to itself as Harbinger and bears a resemblance to the previous character.Multiversity #1 In other media=Television Audrey Marie Anderson as Lyla Michaels/Harbinger in the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". *Lyla Michaels was reimagined and adapted for live-action television on The CW's Arrow, portrayed by Audrey Marie Anderson, also making guest appearances in the spin-off show The Flash. She is introduced in season one as an A.R.G.U.S. agent who is the ex-wife of John Diggle, Green Arrow's crime-fighting partner. In season two, she becomes a member of the Suicide Squad and recruits Diggle to the team on behalf of Amanda Waller, and resumes her relationship with Diggle. In season three, she gives birth to Diggle's daughter Sara, and the pair remarry in \\"Suicidal Tendencies\\" before another Suicide Squad mission. In season four, she becomes head of A.R.G.U.S. following Amanda Waller's death. After Barry Allen alters the timeline in The Flash, Lyla and Diggle's baby daughter Sara is replaced by a son, John Diggle Jr., although neither Lyla or John remember Sara. They are later informed of her previous existence as well as their son's status as a temporal aberration during the \\"Invasion!\\" crossover. While on A.R.G.U.S. missions, Lyla is called \\"Harbinger\\" as her code name. In the eighth season of Arrow it is revealed that she has been in contact with the Monitor. Minutes before Crisis takes place, she becomes a \\"harbinger of things to come\\" when she absorbs energy from Lian Yu and activates a weapon the Monitor requires. As such, the character has now become a more faithful adaptation of her comics counterpart, and plays a major role in the crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Once the Crisis is averted and the multiverse rebooted, Lyla is restored to her original-self, and baby Sara returned to her; now as Diggle Jr.'s sister. In the series finale of Arrow, Lyla and Diggle move to Metropolis; due to the former getting a promotion there. Film *Lyla appears in the animated film Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, voiced by Rachel Quaintance. In the film she lives on Themyscira among the Amazons. When she begins to receive horrible visions of Kara Zor-El's death she joins Wonder Woman in trying to save her. Over their time in Themyscira, the two bond and become very close friends. In trying to save Kara from Darkseid's forces, she dies in her place. Toys *On July 7, 2005 the DC Comics owned company DC Direct released an action figure of Harbinger as part of the line of Crisis action figures.

A wristlock is typically applied by grabbing the opponent's hand, and bending and/or twisting it. Wristlocks are very common in martial arts such as aikido, hapkido and jujutsu where they are featured as self-defense techniques. They are also used as submission holds in martial arts such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu (where the most common name is m√£o de vaca, \\"the cow's hand\\") and catch wrestling.

The wristlock is a technique that can be applied from a stand-up position, simply by grabbing the opponent's hand and twisting and/or bending it in a non-natural direction. It is considered to be a relatively safe technique to practice with a willing opponent,Lowry, Dave. Pain Management. www.blackbeltmag.com. URL accessed on February 11, 2006. but if applied suddenly and/or forcefully, a wristlock can cause ligament tears or possibly even dislocation or bone fractures. Mixed martial arts organizations usually allow wrist locks but they are almost never performed due to the MMA gloves and wrist wraps, which stabilize the wrist. Wrist locks are seen as being easy to defend against, and often leave the attacker vulnerable to punches and elbow strikes.  Types =Rotational Rotational wristlock by an Aikido instructor A rotational wristlock (in budo referred to as kote hineri, and in Aikido referred to as a type of sanky≈ç, ‰∏âÊïô, \\"third teaching\\")Pranin, Stanley. The Encyclopedia of Aikido: Sankyo. www.aikidojournal.com. URL last accessed February 10, 2006.Robertson, Ross. Ikkyo, Nikyo and Sankyo as Geometric Principles. www.mimagazine.com.au. URL last accessed February 10, 2006. is a very common type of wristlock, and involves forced supination or pronation of the wrist, and is typically applied by grabbing and twisting the hand. The wrist joint does not allow rotating motion, and the force is transferred to the forearm causing radioulnar rotation, eventually resulting in a joint lock on the radioulnar joint. Once the radius and ulna have been brought to their extreme positions, further twisting motion will put severe torque on the wrist. In martial arts, standing rotational wristlocks are often accompanied by the opponent instinctively throwing him or herself to escape or alleviate the lock. Supinating A supinating wristlock demonstrated. The supinating wristlock (in bud≈ç referred to as kote gaeshi, Â∞èÊâãËøî, \\"forearm return\\")Arlington Budoshin Ju-Jitsu Dojo. Terminology. www.arlingtonjujitsu.org. URL last accessed February 8, 2006Landman, Howard. The technique of kotegaeshi. www.polyamory.org. URL last accessed February 10, 2006. is a rotational wristlock, and arguably the most common wristlock. It involves rotating the hand so that it becomes maximally supinated, often referred to as 'externally rotating' the wrist, and hence putting a joint lock on the wrist and radioulnar joint. This can be done by grabbing the opponent's hand with one or both hands, and twisting the hand so that the opponent's thumb points away from the opponent. A supinating wristlock performed from a stand-up position can be used to force the opponent to the ground on his or her back. Straightening the arm does not alleviate the pressure, since the shoulder joint does not allow further supination of the hand. A properly executed lock of this type does not apply torque to the wrist itself. In practice, the bones of the forearm and, eventually, the shoulder are the focus of the lock. If performed correctly, this technique will break the opponents wrist, elbow and dislocate the shoulder. In practice, uke will turn over his own arm in order to prevent his wrist from breaking. The goal of almost all throws executed via joint/bone manipulation, at least from the perspective of some classical (koryu) martial arts, is to break or dislocate a limb(s). Pronating Pronating wristlock in a professional wrestling match. Here, William Regal is applying the hold to Cody Rhodes. The pronating wristlock (in bud≈ç referred to as kote mawashi, Â∞èÊâãÂõû„Åó, \\"forearm turn\\", and in Aikido referred to as niky≈ç, ‰∫åÊïô, \\"second teaching\\") is similar to the supinating wristlock except that it is reversed in direction, known as 'internally rotating' the wrist. The hand becomes maximally pronated, resulting in a joint lock on the wrist and radioulnar joint. The degree of possible pronation depends on the degree of flexion at the elbow, as a bent elbow inhibits rotation of the humerus. Hence, straightening the arm allows rotation of the whole arm and alleviates the pressure on the joints. The arm has to be additionally twisted until the shoulder joint reaches maximal rotation to preserve the joint lock. This typically results in the arm moving posteriorly, and allows for the complementary technique of pushing the arm at the elbow or shoulder to force the opponent to the ground. Hyperflexing pain compliance technique. A hyperflexing wristlock (commonly referred to as a \\"gooseneck\\")(in bud≈ç referred to as tekubi gatame, ÊâãÈ¶ñÂõ∫„ÇÅ, \\"wrist lock\\") involves forcing the wrist into hyperflexion by pushing or pulling the hand towards the inside of the forearm. A hyperflexing wristlock is often performed in combination with rotational wristlocks, since the hyperflexed hand provides a good lever for twisting, and in addition it increases the overall effectiveness of the wristlock. Hyperflexing wristlocks are often featured as pain compliance techniques, since they allow for good control, and a gradual pain increase if more leverage is added. Hyperflexing wristlocks are also a typical wristlock used as a submission hold. Hyperflexing wrist locks, often applied after an escape from a rotational wrist lock, is a signature technique in Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan. Hyperextending The \\"hyperextending wristlock\\" is often combined with a fingerlock as the wristlock itself is not very strong. It involves bending the wrist so that the knuckles travel back toward the forearm. Adductive By pressing the opponent's wrist downwards, the hand is forced into extreme ulnar deviation. An adductive wristlock (in bud≈ç referred to as kote hono gaeshi, \\"partial forearm return\\", part of aikido's niky≈ç, or second teaching) involves forced ulnar deviation of the hand. It is typically applied by twisting the opponent's arm so that the opponent's palm points laterally and the elbow is slightly bent. The hand is then grabbed using one or both hands, and the wrist is forced downwards, hence reaching the limit of possible ulnar deviation, and creating a potent joint lock on the wrist joint. To avoid damage, it is possible for the opponent to drop down to the ground, and alleviate the pressure. The adductive wristlock is often taught as a self-defense technique against grabbing. *Note: in aikido this lock is called Niky≈ç; It is also commonly referred to as a \\"Z-Lock\\" because the bend of the arm forms a Z. *Note: in some parts of America this is also called the \\"Goose Neck\\" because the bend of the arm forms a S.

The mall is located at the south end of Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade shopping district, two blocks from the beach and Santa Monica Pier. The mall spans three levels, and is anchored by Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, and an ArcLight Cinema. The mall's tenant mix is predominantly upscale, featuring Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Emporio Armani, and Diane von F√ºrstenberg. It underwent a massive, three-year reconstruction process beginning in January 2008 and was re-opened as a modern outdoor shopping mall on August 6, 2010. History Santa Monica Place originally opened in 1980 at the apex of Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, developed jointly by The Rouse Company and The Hahn Company. Originally anchored by J. W. Robinson's and The Broadway, it featured 120 shops & restaurants and a food court, spanning three levels. Notably, Santa Monica Place was one of the first works of architect Frank Gehry and his first shopping mall, after being rejected from designing The Mall in Columbia, early in his professional career with Gruen Associates. Macerich purchased Santa Monica Place from Rouse in 1999, and rumors of major changes to the then-flailing shopping center were reported. In 2004, the company proposed tearing down the mall and replacing it with a complex of high-rise condos, shops and offices. The plan met with strong opposition from local residents who felt the project did not meet the low-rise character of the neighborhood and would worsen traffic. In a second 2007 proposal, Macerich significantly scaled back its plans, which was received as positive by the public, and was passed. The $250 million project removed the mall's roof and gutted the interior, replacing it with two levels of retail shops and a third level food court. At the same time, Kevin Kennon Architects converted the original Macy's into a Bloomingdale's. While the Steve & Barry's, formerly Robinsons-May was replaced with a Nordstrom. Dallas- based Omniplan served as the executive architects in association with The Jerde Partnership who served as the design architects. The grand reopening occurred on August 6, 2010. The architect for the redesign was Jon Jerde. It was his last major work before he died.  Public Transit Access  The LACMTA E Line terminus station is located across the street from Bloomingdales.

It is one of the earliest mosques in Singapore. The mosque is also known by two other names - Kuchu Palli and Masjid Chulia. Al-Abrar is its official name, while Kuchu Palli, meaning \\"hut mosque\\" in Tamil, is a reflection of the mosque's first modest structure. Its location in Telok Ayer Street, in the heart of Chinatown, was where Chulia immigrants from the Coromandel Coast of South India, among the earliest immigrants to Singapore, settled when they came to Singapore, hence, Masjid Chulia. Note however that another mosque, Masjid Jamae, is also commonly called Masjid Chulia. The building was gazetted as a national monument on 19 November 1974. History The minaret-like towers on the front fa√ßade of the mosque. The early Tamil immigrants first established the Masjid Al-Abrar in 1827 with a makeshift thatched hut that they used for worship until it was replaced by a brick building between 1850 and 1855. An 1856 painting by Percy Carpenter, entitled Telok Ayer Street as seen from Mount Wallich, features an early visual record of the brick mosque. In 1829, the congregation of the mosque was granted a 999-year lease for the land on which the mosque stood. The lease was held in trust by Hadjee Puckery Mohamed Khatib. In 1910, five new trustees were appointed. They were K. Mohamed Eusope, Thambyappa Rarooter, S. Kanisah Maricayar, V.M. Kader Bux and J. Sultan Abdul Kader. The trustees were responsible for all three Chulia mosques: Masjid Al-Abrar, Masjid Jamae and Nagore Durgha. Occupying the width of three shophouse fronts, the mosque was aligned with the street grid that conveniently is also oriented towards Mecca. Inside, the mosque is essentially a one-storey prayer hall. It is much simpler than its earlier counterparts in Singapore. The mosque remained in this form for over a century, with only minor repairs from the 1950s to the mid-1980s. Between 1986 and 1989, major renovations were carried out, and the capacity was expanded to allow up to 800 worshippers in the mosque. An adjacent shophouse was converted into a madrasa and a prayer hall for women in 1998. Masjid Al-Abrar was designated a national monument on 19 November 1974. The mosque is currently administered by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. Architecture The design of the building is based on Indo- Islamic architecture with two tall minarets at the front. The minarets-like towers that define the narrow frontage are devoid of decorative elements, except for a small onion dome on the top of each tower. The building however also includes Neoclassical elements such as Doric columns in its interior. The building was built along a row of shophouses, and the frontage incorporated a five-foot way (1.524 m) that connects the walkway of the other shophouses. At the entrance of the mosque, the parapet that previously fringed only the central bay now ran across the whole length of the frontage. The parapet features an architrave, a frieze with mouldings and panels, a balustrade and Islamic cresting echoing that found on Masjid Sultan. The courtyard that used to lie between the entrance gate and the prayer hall was covered, with part of it converted into a gallery extension. Originally single-storeyed, the prayer hall has been extended to two storeys, with a gallery on the upper floor, and capped with a huge jack roof. While later changes are extensive, the designers took their cue from the original style, proportions and materials used in the old mosque to ensure that the new look is cohesive. Transportation The mosque is accessible within walking distance from Telok Ayer MRT station.

Rescued by cavalry veterinarian Harry Colebourn, Winnie is best-remembered for inspiring A. A. Milne's character, Winnie-the-Pooh. Upon the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Lt. Harry Colebourn of The Fort Garry Horse, a Canadian cavalry regiment, volunteered his service. On 24 August, while en route to Valcartier to report to the Canadian Army Veterinary Corps (CAVC) as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, he purchased a young bear cub for $20 at a train stop in White River, Ontario. The bear's mother was probably killed in the spring of 1914 when the cub was very young and could most easily have become socialized to humans. The name of the hunter who sold the bear and who presumably provided the bear's early socialization is undocumented. Colebourn named the bear \\"Winnipeg\\", \\"Winnie\\" for short, after his home city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Winnie accompanied him to Valcartier and all the way to England, becoming the mascot of the CAVC and a pet to the Second Canadian Infantry Brigade Headquarters. Before leaving for France, Colebourn left Winnie at London Zoo. Winnie's eventual destination was to have been the Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg, but at the end of the War, Colebourn decided to allow Winnie to remain at the London Zoo, where she was much loved for her playfulness and gentleness. Among her fans was A. A. Milne's son Christopher Robin, who consequently changed the name of his own teddy bear from \\"Edward Bear\\" to \\"Winnie the Pooh\\", providing the inspiration for his father's stories about Winnie-the-Pooh. Winnipeg's skull was kept after her death in the Odontological Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons Hunterian Museum in London, and went on public display for the first time in 2015.Coughlan, Sean The skull of the 'real' Winnie goes on display, at BBC News, 20 November 2015 Recognition Winnie-the-Bear statue in Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada There are several statues and plaques commemorating the popular bear. The London Zoo has 1981 statue of Winnie by sculptor Lorne McKean. A statue of Winnie and Colebourn together by sculptor William Epp stands in Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg, in the park's Nature Playground; Epp's design is also seen in another statue at the London Zoo. In 1996, Canada Post issued \\"Winnie and Lieutenant Colebourn, White River, 1914\\" designed by Wai Poon with art direction by Anthony Van Bruggen and computer design by Marcelo Caetano. The 45¬¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Ashton- Potter Canada Limited. The story of Winnie the bear was portrayed in the 2004 movie A Bear Named Winnie starring Michael Fassbender as Colebourn and Bonkers, a 1,000-pound male American black bear, as the adult Winnie.A Bear Named Winnie (official website), originalpicturesinc.com, accessed May 19, 2015.Bonkers biography and filmography, Bearwithus.biz, accessed May 19, 2015. In 2011, Winnipeg author M.A. Appleby, whose father was a friend of Colebourn's son, wrote a children's book about the bear's life titled Winnie the Bear.

This breed is one of the oldest in Britain, going back to pre-Roman times. The Welsh Black was a prized possession of Britain's people upon the invasion of the Saxons. History Commercial exploitation of the breed meant that drovers would drive them to English markets. Herds from south west Wales travelled towards Hereford and Gloucester up the Tywi Valley to Llandovery. Herds from South Cardiganshire reached Llandovery through Llanybydder and Llansawel. The drovers would then return to Wales with large amounts of money, which made them targets of bandits and highwaymen. The result was the formation in 1799 of the Banc yr Eidon in Llandovery, the Bank of the Black Ox, which was later purchased by Lloyds Bank. By the turn of the nineteenth century, 25,000 cattle were being exported from Wales every year. Before the 1960s, few cattle were exported outside the UK, but now can be found in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Germany as well in Saudi Arabia, Jamaica and Uganda. Welsh Black cattle are on the list of endangered native breeds in Wales. Through 1970 this breed served a true dual purpose as there were two subspecies in the country. The Northern Wales subspecies was a stocky breed used for its meat, while the southern subspecies was a more dairy-like breed. As the modern demand for beef has increased a more hybrid species has been developed, which fits traditional needs and the modern demand for beef. Cornish Black It has been speculated that the extinct black cattle of Cornwall were a closely related breed to the Welsh Black. In the nineteenth century they were described as being the same size. Characteristics As the name suggests, the cattle are naturally black. They generally have white horns with black tips, but these may be removed, and there are also naturally hornless (polled) strains. Red individuals occur occasionally - red and other colours were more common in the past. Its hardy nature coupled with its habit of browsing as well as grazing makes it ideal for rough pasture such as heathland and moorland, and for conservation grazing. Traditionally bred for both milk and beef, commercially it is now usually used only for beef.

He is one of only three players to make 99 on his Test match debut.Cricinfo ‚Äì Records ‚Äì Test matches ‚Äì Ninety on debut. stats.cricinfo.com Arthur was the eldest son of the Chipperfield family and was a great sportsman especially in local tennis and cricket at The Entrance, New South Wales. He represented in a Combined Gosford and Wyong Under 25 years side against a Don Bradman XI at Wyong in 1931/32. Arthur played for the Western Suburbs DCC in the Sydney First Grade Competition from 1927/28 to 1936/37 and for Northern Districts from 1937/38 to 1944/45. His selection for the 1934 Australian team to tour England came as something of a surprise, following only three first-class matches. Arthur was then 28 years old, but 152 for Northern Districts at Newcastle against Jardine‚Äôs 1932/33 MCC side had given notice of his ability. With 84 against Queensland on his state debut for NSW, he furthered the good impression already made. In England, he did not enjoy the best of health, but finished the tour with 899 runs at an average of 40.86 showing good defence and could when required hit hard and score at a good pace. He was a fine slip fieldsman and a useful bowler of leg-breaks. Arthur made his Test debut in the First Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham in the 1934 series, where having reached 99 by lunch on the second day, he was out without addition to the third ball afterwards, caught behind by Ames off Farnes. He was the first to be dismissed for 99 in his first Test. He played in the remaining four Tests. He toured South Africa in 1935/36 where he scored his only Test hundred, 109 in Durban. He played against England in three Tests when they toured Australia in 1936/37 and he was selected in the Australian team to tour England in 1938 where his only and last Test was in the Second Test at Lords. During this 1938 tour, Arthur was very ill for much of the time, was operated on for appendicitis and missed most of the matches.Arthur Chipperfield. espncricinfo.com He played 14 Tests, 20 innings, scored 552 runs at an average of 32.47.

The individual self assesses where they are on the scale. The SUDS may be used as a benchmark for a professional or observer to evaluate the progress of treatment. In desensitization-based therapies, such as those listed below, the patients' regular self assessments enable them to guide the clinician repeatedly as part of the therapeutic dialog. The SUD-level was developed by Joseph Wolpe in 1969. It has been used in cognitive-behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders (e.g. exposure practices and hierarchy) and for research purposes. There is no hard and fast rule by which a patient can self assign a SUDS rating to his or her disturbance or distress, hence the name subjective. Some guidelines are: * The intensity recorded must be as it is experienced now. * Constriction or congestion or tensing of body parts indicates a higher SUDS than that reported. __TOC__ The scale Here is one version of the scale: 10 = Feels unbearably bad, beside yourself, out of control as in a nervous breakdown, overwhelmed, at the end of your rope. You may feel so upset that you don't want to talk because you can't imagine how anyone could possibly understand your agitation. 9 = Feeling desperate. What most people call a 10 is actually a 9. Feeling extremely freaked out to the point that it almost feels unbearable and you are getting scared of what you might do. Feeling very, very bad, losing control of your emotions. 8 = Freaking out. The beginning of alienation. 7 = Starting to freak out, on the edge of some definitely bad feelings. You can maintain control with difficulty. 6 = Feeling bad to the point that you begin to think something ought to be done about the way you feel. 5 = Moderately upset, uncomfortable. Unpleasant feelings are still manageable with some effort. 4 = Somewhat upset to the point that you cannot easily ignore an unpleasant thought. You can handle it OK but don't feel good. 3 = Mildly upset. Worried, bothered to the point that you notice it. 2 = A little bit upset, but not noticeable unless you took care to pay attention to your feelings and then realize, \\"yes\\" there is something bothering me. 1 = No acute distress and feeling basically good. If you took special effort you might feel something unpleasant but not much. 0 = Peace, serenity, total relief. No more anxiety of any kind about any particular issue. Utility does not require precision In using SUDS in a therapeutic setting, the therapist does not necessarily define the scale, because one of the benefits of asking a patient or client for a SUDS score is that it is simple. Typically, you can ask the client, \\"On a scale of zero to ten, where zero is the best you can feel and ten is the worst, how do you feel right now?\\" The purpose of this question is to enable the patient or client to notice improvements, and the inherent difference between one person's subjective scale and another person's is irrelevant to therapy with either individual. Our brains are sophisticated enough that they can usually summarize a large amount of data very quickly, and often accurately. There is a possibility that in some forms of therapy, the patient will want to see progress and will therefore report progress that isn't objectively present‚Äîa type one error from a statistical point of view. While both type I and type II errors are important in research situations, type one errors can have a therapeutic utility in clinical situations, in which they can provide an indirect opportunity for positive autosuggestion‚Äîmuch like the indirect suggestions employed in Ericksonian hypnosis. Thus, since the main use of SUDS is for clinical purposes, rather than research purposes, the imprecise nature of the scale is relatively unimportant to its main users: patients and clinicians.

Corbett's father, tired of the city, relocated the family to rural Camp Sherman, Oregon, where she spent her early life. \\"I rode my horse to school every day, four miles each way,\\" she recalled in a 1985 interview. \\"I hated it then, but, in retrospect, it was a marvelous life and a great way to grow up.\\" The family eventually returned to Portland in her later childhood, where her mother worked as an administrator at the University of Portland. At age seven, Corbett was inspired to become an actress after attending the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Corbett attended the Catlin Gabel School in Portland, and as a teenager apprenticed with the Carnival Theatre camp at the University of Oregon.

In a royal service career that spanned over six decades, the Lord of Myawaddy served under four kings in various capacities, and was a longtime secretary to King Bagyidaw. Multi-talented Sa is best remembered for his innovative contributions to classical Burmese music and drama, as well as for his brilliant military service. Sa composed many songs in various styles drawn from different traditions, wrote several plays and dramas including translated works from Thai and Javanese dramas, and brought innovations to Burmese theater. He invented the 13-string Burmese harp and introduced marionette plays to the Ava court. Sa was also an able military commander who led King Bodawpaya's annexation of Manipur in 1813. As the commander of Arakan theater under Gen. Maha Bandula in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824‚Äì1826, Sa achieved a few battlefield victories in an otherwise disastrous war for the Burmese. After the war, he became minister of Army and was given Myawaddy as his fief in 1828. Sa led the Burmese diplomatic efforts to have the British abandon their claims to Kabaw Valley in 1830. He was imprisoned from 1836 to 1839 by King Tharrawaddy, who overthrew Bagyidaw. Sa held no further public office after his release from prison, but continued to write songs and plays for kings Tharrawaddy and Pagan. Early life Maung Sa was born 28 October 1766 (10th waning of Thadingyut 1128 ME) at Migyaungtet Chaung village, near Sagaing to a family line of courtiers more than two hundred years old. His father Pauk Kyaw was a son of the Royal Household Guards, and his mother Nyein Tha was a granddaughter of Binnya Gyandaw, a minister in the court of King Thalun. He was schooled at the Parama Monastery in the capital Ava.Myint-U (2006), p. 135 Still a teenager, Sa married Ma Aye, daughter of the King's goldsmith Nyun of Sagaing. Sa worked as a goldsmith and dealer. His wife died in 1785, when he was just 19. After the death of his wife, Sa briefly became an itinerant player of kye-waing (brass gongs) in U Tayoke's orchestra in Ava. Sa quickly gained recognition as an accomplished musician, and was noticed by Crown Prince Thado Minsaw who was bringing together a circle of innovative young artists in his private court. Still 19, Sa joined the Royal Service to become a royal page, a kind of apprenticeship only open to members of gentry and nobility. Career=Artist One of his first assignments in the royal service was to record the stories of traditional Burmese spirits Thirty Seven Nats, along with their traditional rituals, dances and music. He accomplished the task with the aid of musicians Tayoke and Myat Tha. In 1789, the 23-year- old Sa was placed in a Royal Commission consisted of princes and ministers, charged with translating Siamese and Javanese dramas from Thai to Burmese. (Siamese court musicians and artists captured from Ayutthaya in 1767 had been staging performances in the Burmese court, and training Burmese professional actors in Siamese style.)Brandon, p. 27 With the help of Siamese artists, the commission adapted two important epics from Thai to Burmese: the Siamese Ramayana and the Enao, the Siamese version of Javanese Panji tales into Burmese Yama Zatdaw and Enaung Zatdaw. With Enaung, Sa wrote the dialogue, songs, musical scores, arrangements and stage directions.Thaw Kaung Sa also updated the 7-string Burmese harp into a 13-string one. He composed over forty classical thachin-gans, kyos, bwes and patpyos.Jankovic, Anthology of Burmese Poetry Influenced by Siamese and Mon music, Sa experimented with different musical styles. He wrote many \\"Yodaya\\" (Burmese for Ayutthaya) style songs: \\"htat-tunts\\", \\"ngu-ngits\\", \\"khameins\\", \\"frantins\\", \\"keet-muns\\", \\"htanauks\\", ale-mes, \\"phyinchars\\", \\"bayet-le-swes\\", and \\"phyin-chins;\\" some are for oboes and others for brass-gongs. He also wrote three types of songs in Mon style. In 1820, Sa resumed his compilation of the stories of the Thirty-Seven Nats, in collaboration with Kawi Deva Kyaw, a leading Nat medium, and historian U Nu. In the same year he experimented with marionette shows, in consultation with Thabin Wun, Curator of Dramatic Arts. After the First Anglo-Burmese War, Sa continued to write plays but spent more time on music. He collected songs from all sources, Siamese, Burmese, Mon, and from all levels: songs sung at court, songs sung by spirit worshipers, songs sung at feasts and folk songs. He continued his experiments in blending the various musical traditions of the country.Htin Aung, pp. 230‚Äì231 Ever the curious, Sa taught himself some Hindi and some Latin hymns. Military commander In 1808, Sa was named Herald and Commander of Warboat Pye Lon Yu, and later atwinwun (secretary) to the new Crown Prince Bagyidaw. In February 1814, Commander Sa with the title Ne Myo Zeya Thura led a Burmese army of 1500 soldiers and 150 cavalry into Manipur to place Marjit Singh on the Manipuri throne. At 53, Sa became secretary to the king, when Bagyidaw ascended to the Burmese throne in 1819. When war broke out with the British in March 1824, Sa was assigned as a general under Supreme Commander Maha Bandula in the Arakan theater. In May 1824, Sa led a column (about 4000)Phayre, pp. 236‚Äì247 into Bengal, and defeated British troops in the Battle of Ramu, 10 miles east of Cox's Bazar on 17 May 1824.Harvey, p. 341 He then joined Bandula's column on the march to defeat British forces at Gadawpalin, and went on to capture Cox's Bazar. Sa's success caused extreme panic in Chittagong and in Calcutta but a cautious Bandula stopped Sa from proceeding too far ahead.Htin Aung, p. 212 Sa was left to command remaining Burmese troops in Arakan after Bandula and the main battalions were ordered to withdraw from Arakan by Bagyidaw to meet the British invasion in Yangon in August 1824. Sa held on to Arakan throughout 1824 when the main focal point of the war played out in Yangon. After Gen. Archibald Campbell finally defeated Gen. Bandula in the Battle of Yangon in December 1824, the British turned their sights to Arakan. On 1 February 1825, an invasion force of 11,000 soldiers supported by a flotilla of gun boats and armed cruisers along the coast and a squadron of cavalry under the command of Gen. Morrison attacked Burmese positions in Arakan. Despite their superior numbers and firearms, the British had to fight Sa's depleted Burmese forces for nearly two months before they reached to the main Burmese garrison at Mrauk-U, Arakan's capital. On 29 March 1825, the British launched their attack on Mrauk-U. (At the same time, Campbell also launched an attack on Bandula's positions in the Battle of Danubyu.) After a few days of fighting, the Burmese at Mrauk-U were defeated on April 1, coincidentally the same day Maha Bandula fell at Danubyu. Sa and remaining Burmese forces evacuated and left Arakan. The British proceeded to occupy the rest of Arakan. Sa saw firsthand the destructive power and discipline of the British army. Statesman After the war, Sa remained a close adviser to the king. In 1828, Bagyidaw made Sa his Army Minister with Myawaddy as his fief. Sa's fiefdom covered all the land at the confluence of the Made and Irrawaddy Rivers, including 14 villages and a town, in present- day Magwe Division. Now known as Myawaddy Mingyi (Lord of Myawaddy) with a noble style Thiri Maha Zeya Thura, Sa led Burmese diplomatic negotiations with the British resident envoy to Ava, Major Henry Burney. While Sa was unable to get back Arakan and Tenasserim, Sa was able to convince Burney to abandon the British claims on Kabaw Valley as part of Manipur. Starting in the late 1820s, Sa directed translation of English language newspapers for the king and the court.Myint-U (2001), p. 100 Prisoner In 1836, Prince Tharrawaddy, who was also a commander in the war, rebelled against his brother King Bagyidaw. As Bagyidaw's secretary, Sa was duly arrested by Tharrawaddy. When Tharrawaddy became king in 1837, he stripped Sa of his lordship and imprisoned him for two more years in road gang. Sa was released from prison in 1839 after he composed songs for a royal marionette show and for he had long been a favorite of Tharrawaddy's daughter Princess Supayagyi. Sa was then 73 and held no further public office. He continued to write songs for kings Tharrawaddy and Pagan. He died on 6 August 1853 (1st waxing of Wagaung 1215 ME) at age 86, soon after King Mindon ascended the throne.

The NAR publish in particular a historical review entitled Le Lys rouge and a political semi- monthly Royaliste.

Its leader, Bertrand Renouvin, appealed to his supporters to vote for Socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand in both the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections. In November 1989, the NAR joined the 89 pour l'√©galit√© movement, which campaigned to get voting rights for immigrants alongside SOS Racisme.

The ideas of NAR are characterized by souverainism, anti-liberalism and anti- Americanism. They are economically Keynesian. The NAR appealed to vote against the European Constitution in the referendum of 29 May 2005. The organization is member of the International Monarchist Conference.

From until 2016, he was the director of professional scouting for the Los Angeles Angels.espn.com 2011.11.14 High school and college career Morris attended Munster High School in Munster, Indiana, and the University of Michigan. While at Munster, he was an all Lake Suburban Conference tennis player four times, losing only one match in his junior and senior seasons, an all Lake Suburban Conference basketball player his senior year who set a school record for blocked shots, and a three time all Lake Suburban Conference baseball player. He was an Indiana Baseball All Star in 1983, and was named the MVP of the annual North-South All Star Game in Jasper, Indiana, where he went 8-9 in the series. Morris captained the tennis, basketball, and baseball teams in his senior season at Munster. His Michigan teams won the Big 10 Championship in 1984 and 1986, and advanced to the College World Series in 1984. Morris set records for slugging percentage and batting average while at Michigan. His teammates at Michigan included future Major League players Barry Larkin, Chris Sabo, Jim Abbott, Scott Kamieniecki, Mike Ignasiak, and Gary Wayne. In 1985, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Major League career Morris played for the New York Yankees, the Cincinnati Reds, the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers. Morris was known for his unusual hitting technique, in which his feet never settled as the pitcher delivered the ball, so his swing was preceded by his feet shuffling towards the plate. Morris was not known for his power, but he had the ability to spray the ball to all corners of the ballpark. He also appeared on the cover of Wheaties. In a 13 year major league career, Morris posted a .304 batting average with 76 home runs and 513 RBI in 1,246 games played. Defensively, he was a solid first baseman, posting a .994 fielding percentage at that position. New York Yankees Morris was selected by the New York Yankees in the eighth round of the amateur draft. He was named the Rookie of the Year in the New York Penn League in 1986, set an Albany-Colony Yankees record for hits in a season in 1987, was second in the International League in hitting in 1988, then led the International League in hitting in 1989 at .326. He debuted with the Yankees on July 29, 1988 against the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto. He collected a base hit in his first at bat, a single to left field against Toronto reliever Duane Ward. Morris was thought so highly of in the Yankee organization that they considered trading Don Mattingly to make room for him. Cincinnati Reds Morris was part of the World Champion Cincinnati Reds in 1990 On December 12, 1989. Morris was traded, along with Rodney Imes to the Cincinnati Reds with pitcher Tim Leary and outfielder Van Snyder.http://www.baseball- almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=morriha02 The trade proved beneficial for the Reds as Morris was a part of the 1990 Cincinnati Reds, which won the World Series. He hit .340 on the year, which, at the time, was the third highest batting average by a rookie in 50 years. Also, his 136 OPS+ led the team. His sacrifice fly in game 4 turned out to be the series-winning RBI. While the Reds failed to repeat their World Series win in 1991, Morris had another strong season, finishing one point behind Atlanta's Terry Pendleton in the battle for the National League hitting crown. Morris ended the year at .318, while Pendleton finished at .319. Until Casey McGehee failed to make the All Star team in 2014, Morris had been the last player to be leading his league in hits at the All Star break and not do so. In 1994, Morris was hitting .358 with 120 hits at the All Star break, but was not selected to the team. Morris was named the 1994 Reds MVP by the Cincinnati Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. On November 2, 1995, Morris became a free agent but was resigned by the Reds on December 6, 1995. Morris compiled a 32-game hitting streak from August 26, 1996 to April 3, 1997. This streak is the longest by a first baseman in the modern era of Major League baseball. His .319 average at Riverfront Stadium was the highest by any Reds player in the history of the stadium. Kansas City Morris was again granted free agency on October 29, 1997, signing with Kansas City in December of that year.http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=morriha02 He stayed with Kansas City for one year, before again becoming a free agent. Cincinnati Reds Morris re-signed with the Reds, playing the 1999 season with them and part of the 2000 season. Detroit Tigers Morris was sold to the Tigers on July 18, 2000 and played with them for the rest of the season. Since 1961‚Äîthe start of Major League Baseball's Expansion Era‚ÄîHal Morris and Derek Jeter are the only players with a minimum of 10 seasons in the Major Leagues who collected a game-ending RBI in their final home game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Morris did it with the Tigers with a pinch-hit single on Oct. 1, 2000, giving his team a 12-11 win over the Twins, while Jeter hit a game winning single against the Orioles in his final appearance at Yankee Stadium on September 25, 2014. For Morris, this was the final at bat of his career. Morris was declared a free agent on November 1, 2000 and he retired.

In other words, it is the interval between two consecutive scale degrees. Any larger interval is called a skip (also called a leap), or disjunct motion. In the diatonic scale, a step is either a minor second (sometimes also called half step) or a major second (sometimes also called whole step), with all intervals of a minor third or larger being skips. For example, C to D (major second) is a step, whereas C to E (major third) is a skip. More generally, a step is a smaller or narrower interval in a musical line, and a skip is a wider or larger interval with the categorization of intervals into steps and skips is determined by the tuning system and the pitch space used. Melodic motion in which the interval between any two consecutive pitches is no more than a step, or, less strictly, where skips are rare, is called stepwise or conjunct melodic motion, as opposed to skipwise or disjunct melodic motion, characterized by frequent skips. Half steps In the major scale or any of its modes, a step will always be a movement of 1 or 2 semitones, and a skip a movement of 3 or more semitones.

It features flying car vehicles, called sleds, designed by industrial designer Syd Mead. The 1995 game Cyber Speedway is a spiritual sequel to CyberRace. Plot In the game manual the background setting for the game's universe is told. There are two main rivaling empires: Terra and Kaladasia. After the galaxy was nearly destroyed, war battles were replaced with racing competition. The player in the role of Clay Shaw is forced to become a sled pilot for the Terran team, as his girlfriend is held captive by a Terran agent named Dobbs. Terra wants Shaw as a pilot because his father, John Shaw, was a well-known, successful pilot, and Clay is hoped to become equally good. Gameplay The player can select strategy options and equipment for the sled before the race. The races take place on different planets which provide the background for the racing circuits. The player must fly the sled along the circuit for several rounds, the number of rounds increasing with progression in the game. The player and computer-generated competitors can use weapons (e.g. missiles) and shields. Cockpit view during the race. Release CyberRace was released in two editions: on six 3¬Ω-inch floppy disks and on one Compact Disc. Both packages included a manual, a quick reference card, a small plastic model of a racing sled and a signed card by Syd Mead. As the game was programmed for DOS, playing it on modern PCs is usually not possible under modern operating systems without the use of an emulator such as DOSBox. Plastic model of a sled, part of the game package. Reception Computer Gaming World stated in February 1994 that CyberRace was \\"primarily action intensive\\", but that with Mead helping to develop the storyline, \\"the story itself may actually eclipse game play\\", with \\"strong appeal among sci-fi fans and racing enthusiasts\\". A longer review in March 1994 described the graphics as \\"spectacular ... amazing\\" and the racing as \\"a lot of fun\\", albeit \\"fairly easy\\" after time. It reported, however, that CyberRace did not live up to the hype of a game \\"from the man who brought you Blade Runner\\", stating that Mead's influence was only visible in the sled designs and that good voice acting did not compensate for poor writing, non- racing animation, and not enough playtesting. The magazine concluded that \\"CyberRace is a fun, visually stunning race simulator with a rather weakly constructed and executed narrative framework\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that \\"While the racing can be mildly interesting ... an uninteresting plot and characters fail to keep interest, despite some pretty neat artwork\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared CyberRace the 39th-worst computer game ever released.

Life Dawn Lake was born to a Balmain working-class family, the youngest of four children. She married entertainer Bobby Limb in 1953 and they had one daughter, Debbie, born in 1955. She was married to Limb for 46 years, though the marriage had its ups and downs, including a separation for a year in 1973. She lost her brother, David, to suicide in 1965.Anderson (2006) p. 38 Bobby Limb died in 1999, after which she withdrew from performing life. Career She started her career as a singer in a local dance hall when she was 21, and soon after was contracted to Joe Taylor's Celebrity Club circuit. She met Bobby Limb at this time. After their marriage in 1953, they went to the UK where she had won a contract to sing with the BBC Show Band. Their careers went well in England over the next four years, with Lake appearing frequently as a guest on the Cyril Stapleton radio show, and with the couple appearing at the London Palladium and on the Moss Empire circuit. On their return to Australia in 1957 she appeared on the Tivoli circuit, and sang on 2UE and ABC radio stations, frequently with Bobby Limb's band. While she came to prominence on radio programs compered by Jack Davey and George Wallace, she found her greatest fame through her collaborations with Bobby Limb on the early Australian television programs The Mobil Limb Show produced by TCN9, Bobby Limb's Sound of Music, and, for two years in the mid-1960s, Here's Dawn. Limb's production company also created the situation comedy series The Private World of Miss Prim (1966) as a vehicle for Lake, but the series was short-lived. Lake was subsequently a regular for the 1967 season of the top-rated sketch comedy program The Mavis Bramston Show. Through the 1970s she guest starred in Australian drama series such as Division 4 and Glenview High, and appeared as a panellist on Graham Kennedy's game show Blankety Blanks. She also made a few appearances in dramatic feature films of this period, with roles in Squeeze a Flower, Sunstruck, Alvin Purple, and the controversial Wake in Fright. She also returned to the stage at this time, appearing such shows as Some of My Best Friends Aren't, Just for Arthur, Move Over Mrs Markham and The Mating Season (opposite Sid James). In her later life she participated in a series of national concerts for seniors, organised by Limb. Bobby Limb and Dawn Lake entertained Australian troops in Vietnam, and were active in the campaign to elect the Whitlam Labor government in 1972, including taking part in the campaign song, It's Time. Her most enduring character was Ethel, who first appeared in the early 1960s in The Mobil Limb Show. \\"You tell 'em, luv!\\" was Ethel's catchcry, a line which was quickly adopted by Federal politicians during parliamentary Question Time.

It was released in 2001.  Producer The Sony Circ Audio Walkman comes from the walkman division of Sony Colour The walkman comes in a variety of colours: green, silver, blue, and black. Each is actually a combination of two colours; the main body is one colour, and the screen is usually a complementary colour, except on the silver model, which has a reflective screen. The included earphones reflect the colour of the device.  Capacity The Walkman Circ is available in capacities of 1 GB, 512 MB, and 256 MB. The 256 MB can hold approximately 100 songs, the 512 MB 240 songs, and the 1 GB can hold 480 songs, dependent on song length. It has been speculated you could use this device as a USB stick, but it may damage software if you are not experienced. Battery The device runs off 1 AAA battery, and can last up to 70 hours with backlight and no power save, or 100 hours with no backlight and power save. Operation The device is operated by \\"tilting the screen\\" in different directions. It also has volume control on the side, as well as a \\"hold\\", \\"file\\" and \\"song\\" toggle mode. In \\"file\\", you can choose what playlist you want to play. In \\"song\\" mode, you chose individual songs. In \\"hold\\" mode, no buttons work, only the toggle switch. On the rear of the device are two small buttons labeled \\"menu\\" and \\"repeat/equalizer\\". The equalizer is a program that differentiates the treble, delay and pitch of the music. The repeat button allows you to select different repeat options. Menu Also, the device's internal menu allows you to change date and time settings, backlight settings, tone settings, repeat settings, and equalizer settings. Software As well as an internal program, the walkman comes standard with a music program called Sonic Stage. This program is similar to Windows Media Player, or QuickTime. It works with all Sony Walkmans, and is upgradable through the internet. The program has been a deterrent for consumers debating between the iPod and Circ due to the complexity involved in Sony's program when transferring music from the computer onto the Circ.

One of its main products was adventure serial The Rovers, which was aimed at breaking the international market. Early days  Bobby Limb was born in Adelaide, South Australia and entered a show business career beginning in 1941, at the age of 17, when he became a saxophone player with various dance bands around his home city of Adelaide. His bright personality soon made him a bandleader and comedian. By 1952, Bobby was already one of Australia's leading entertainers, with a fan-club on radio station 2UW, which boasted 35,000 teenage members. Radio  He appeared in the satirical radio program The Idiot Weekly in 1958 and 1959, alongside such players as Spike Milligan, Ray Barrett and John Bluthal and John Ewart but was better known for his own radio, and later TV shows. Television host  His most successful television shows were The Mobil Limb Show, Australia's first national television show, and Bobby Limb's The Sound of Music, which ran for nine years 1963‚Äì1972, being the country's top-rated show for most of that time. Limb switched with his program from TCN Channel 9 to TEN10 in exactly the same timeslot on Friday nights. Channel 9 then picked up the younger Barry Crocker from TEN10 where he'd been hosting a similar program called \\"Say it with Music\\", and placed this into almost exactly the same timeslot with the same \\"Sound of Music\\" name on Friday nights. Crocker's initial success waned, but both versions were axed within a few years as the format had had its run. Marriage  Bobby Limb married fellow entertainer Dawn Lake in 1953, and often appeared with her. As a couple, they became iconic within the Australian entertainment industry. So popular was their appeal in their native land that Bert Newton even called them \\"Australia's Lucille and Desi\\". Support and foundations  He promoted and supported young musicians, such as the group Human Nature. He supported Diabetes Australia, and founded the Bobby Limb Foundation to help sufferers of diabetes. Death and legacy  On 11 September 1999, Bobby Limb died of cancer, a condition he had previously suffered and apparently beaten. At Limb's funeral, the former Whitlam government minister Doug McClelland said that Bobby Limb was to the Australian entertainment industry what Sir Donald Bradman was to cricket, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith was to aviation, Dame Joan Sutherland was to opera, and Dr Victor Chang was to surgery. Popular appeal Bobby Limb's enduring popularity was based on a solid 'middle-of-the- road' musical format, knock-about (never 'way-out') comedy, and a 'something for the whole family' style wholesomeness. In the late 1950s, Limb took up the torch of supplying middle-Australia's tastes in entertainment from that of radio personality of Jack Davey, but Limb's star began to fade in the 1970s when the TV audience shifted its tastes away from family 'variety' shows towards wall-to-wall 80's style pop-music, home-grown soap-opera like A Country Practice and Neighbours and most especially harder-edged, satirical comedy like The Aunty Jack Show. Bobby Limb remained a hit with older Australian audiences but his later appearances were almost entirely off- screen, held at various live venues around the nation, like clubs and theatres, often in connection with charity fund-raising. Conversion to Christianity  In 1983, following many professional and personal problems, Bobby Limb became a born-again Christian. Gold Logie  He won a total of 11 Logie Awards, including the 1964 Gold Logie, awarded to the Most Popular Personality on Australian Television. Awards  He won a Mr Show Business award in the USA. In 1983, he won the Australian Father of the Year award. British and Australian honours  In 1967 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his efforts in entertaining Australian troops in the Vietnam War.It's an Honour: OBE In 2000, nine months after his death, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) \\"For service to the Australian entertainment industry, to tourism, and to the community, particularly through support for charitable organisations\\". Although announced posthumously, the award was made with effect from 2 September 1999.It's an Honour: AO  References  *Life and Limb: the highlights and traumas of Bobby Limb's days in TV and Show Biz.

He held several Malaysian ministerial posts and was appointed as the second Deputy Prime Minister in 1970 by then prime minister Tun Abdul Razak. Three years later, Ismail died in office due to a heart attack. Ismail has been called \\"the man who saved Malaysia\\" for his actions as Minister of Home Affairs after the May 13 Incident of racial rioting in 1969.\\"The Man Who Saved Malaysia\\", p. 1. (30 December 2006). New Straits Times. Early life Ismail was born on 4 November 1915 in Johor Bahru, Johor. He was the son of Abdul Rahman Yassin, who was of Buginese descent.Thajunnisa (2004), p. 4 Abdul Rahman was the first President of the Dewan Negara (Senate) of the Parliament of Malaysia, and also the first chairman of Malayan Banking.Ooi, Kee Beng (18 January 2007). The Reluctant Politician: Tun Dr Ismail and His Time , pp. E2‚ÄìE3, E8. The Sun. His maternal grandfather was Mohamed Salleh Abdullah, an ethnic Chinese convert to Islam and former State Treasurer of Johor. After Ismail's mother Zahara Abu Bakar, Abdul Rahman's wife, died in 1936, Abdul Rahman married Kamariah, the sister of Onn Ja'afar, the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Johor. The remarriage was encouraged by Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, who sought to unite the Johor aristocracy by blood. Abdul Rahman himself almost became Menteri Besar according to Ismail, but failed because he \\"refused to indulge in intrigues\\". Education Ismail was raised by his maternal grandmother due to his mother's various illnesses, and received his primary education at Sekolah Bukit Zaharah, although his education was interrupted by frequent trips to see distant relatives. Ismail's initial friends were predominantly Malay, but when he continued his education at the English College Johore Bahru, Ismail gravitated to non-Malays due to his interest in the opposite sex ‚Äì Chinese girls often being given more freedom to mingle than their Malay counterparts in those days. Ismail later said: \\"I am convinced that this early mingling with the other races during the most impressionable stage of my life had a lot to do with my non-racial outlook.\\" Ismail forged close friendships with the daughters of Cheah Tiang Earn, a friend of his father's. Eileen and Joyce Chuah would later both marry into the influential Kuok family, which Ismail got to know through them. Ismail also befriended the children of Joseph Chako Puthucheary, who would later become important players in Malaysian and Singaporean politics. Try Ismail's father believed strongly in the benefits of education, unlike many Malays of the time, and ensured his children received the best education possible. Two of his sons became lawyers and another an economist. In 1939, the British General Adviser W.E. Pepys lamented that \\"the only Johore Malay who has got a university degree is Inche (Mr.) Suleiman bin Abdul Rahman, the son of Dato Abdul Rahman, State Treasurer, Johore.\\" Ismail himself went on to obtain a degree at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore. In 1945, he became the first Malay to obtain a MBBS from University of Melbourne, Australia. Ismail's son later said that his education in Australia greatly impacted his worldview: \\"He was on his own and a member of a minority there. He didn‚Äôt have other Malays to prop him up and he had a sense of loneliness. He felt that he was treated as an equal and that this was the way he would want to treat other people as well.\\"Sunday Interview: Secrets and all ‚Äì A son shares a legacy . (7 January 2007). Malaysia Today. Early career In 1946, the British formed the Malayan Union, a polity seen as infringing on the special position of the Malays and the Malay Rulers. Ismail's family was heavily involved in the anti-Malayan Union campaign led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). After the successful campaign led to the replacement of the Malayan Union with the Federation of Malaya, Ismail was appointed to the Johor state legislative assembly by Dato' Onn Ja'afar, the Chief Minister of Johor. Ismail was also offered a seat on the Federal Legislative Council by Onn, but on the condition that Ismail join UMNO. Ismail refused, insisting that he would only join UMNO if it committed itself to fighting for Malayan independence.\\"Malayan Union brings Ismail to the crossroads\\", pp. 10‚Äì12. (1 January 2007). New Straits Times. In the Johor state legislative assembly, his very first action was to declare his opposition to the UMNO-supported federation, which he considered in contravention of the Johor state constitution. Ismail focused on his private practice, founding the Tawakkal (Trust in God) Clinic which he ran from 1947 to 1953. During this period, Ismail co-founded the Malay Graduates' Association, a political discussion group for intellectuals. Ismail observed: Marriage and personal life In 1950, Ismail married Norashikin Mohd Seth (nicknamed Neno) in an arranged marriage. On passing through Kuala Lumpur on the way to their honeymoon in Penang, they met Tunku Abdul Rahman, who would later succeed Onn Jaafar as President of UMNO. Ismail later recounted that the Tunku had invited him and his new bride to the Kuala Lumpur Flying Club to dance, but upon finding that they were newlyweds \\"bundled us off telling us that we had no business being on the dance floor so late when we should be in bed enjoying our honeymoon.\\" The Tunku later cited the support of Ismail and the Malay Graduates Association as the major impetus for his decision to become President, while Ismail in turn claimed he decided to join UMNO only after the Tunku became President in 1951. Ismail would have six children with Neno: Tawfik (born 1951), Zailah (born 1953), Badariah, Tarmizi (born 1956), Zamakhshari (born 1958) and Ariff (born 1961). Pre-independence Ismail entered Malaysian politics in 1951 when he was elected as vice-president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). He had earlier been the nominee of the Malay Graduates Association to the UMNO Central Executive Committee. Initially, Ismail and his brother Suleiman, also an UMNO member, mainly clashed with Dato Onn, who had left UMNO to form the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) after UMNO refused to open membership to non-Malays. Ismail was very critical of Onn, who had made \\"very inflammatory communal speeches attacking the Chinese\\". Suleiman later defeated Onn in the first Malayan general election, and was lauded as a \\"giant-killer\\" for his landslide victory against Onn, who had been the favourite. Ismail was also instrumental in gaining a greater amount of autonomy for the local government, when in 1954 the Alliance government (a coalition of UMNO and the Malayan Chinese Association or MCA) decided to boycott the British-backed local elections. When the British High Commissioner Donald MacGillivray met with the Tunku, Ismail, and the MCA's representative of H. S. Lee, he accused them of playing into the hands of the Malayan Communist Party, which was waging an armed insurgency against the British. The source of the dispute was that the British High Commissioner had been given the discretion to nominate six seats, in addition to those contested in the elections. Ismail proposed a compromise: the Alliance would support the elections, but only if the High Commissioner would consult with the party that won the elections before making his appointments. MacGillivray initially refused, but after finding public opinion against him, backed down. Later, Ismail was part of the Malayan government delegation sent to London to negotiate terms for independence from the British. In the Federal Legislative Council, he was also a strong proponent of the controversial Razak Report. Outside the Council, many Chinese were upset about the lack of provisions for vernacular education, while within the Council, Malay members from UMNO condemned the Report for not making Malay the sole medium of instruction. Ismail accused the report's opponents in the Council of making \\"no considerations for the Chinese and Indians who are already in this country\\", and acting in an imperialistic manner. If the non- Malays accepted Malaya's status as a Malay country and that the national language was Malay, he argued, there was no reason to further suppress them. The Razak Report eventually became law, when the Council approved it as the Education Ordinance of 1957. Ismail analysed the Malay distrust of the Chinese as such: In Ismail's view, it was imperative that \\"if the Chinese ‚Äì the real political problem since the other races were not dominant ‚Äì were to be persuaded into accepting Malay as the national language, they should be granted citizenship as a quid pro quo\\" ‚Äì an early expression of what would later be referred to as the Malaysian social contract. Independent Malaya After independence in 1957, Ismail was appointed as Malaya and Malaysia's first ambassador to the United States of America, as well as the United Nations ‚Äì two posts to be held concurrently by him from 1957 till 1959. When Ismail led the independent Malayan delegation to the General Assembly, he carried the traditional Malay dagger (kris) ‚Äì according to him, the first time a weapon of any kind had been brought into the assembly. At the UN, Ismail developed a strongly held view that Malayan foreign policy had to keep \\"an independent line, by which I mean that our stand on international problems should not be influenced by the policies of other countries, big or small\\".\\"Ismail's struggle to form Malaysia and Asean\\", pp. 12‚Äì13. (2 January 2007). New Straits Times. While serving in the United States and at the United Nations, Ismail wrote personal notes to the Prime Minister, which were recently compiled and published in a book titled \\"Malaya's First Year at the UN\\". Ismail remained involved in local politics, however, and pressed for the Alliance coalition of UMNO, the MCA and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) to merge into one multi-racial party, instead of remaining as a coalition comprising three mono-racial parties.\\"The inevitability of separation\\", pp. 12‚Äì14. (3 January 2007). New Straits Times. Upon returning to Malaya in 1959, he was appointed as external affairs minister. The following year, a controversy arose when the Tunku stated that Malaya would eventually have to recognise the communist People's Republic of China. This was, in the Tunku's words, \\"a sudden change in our policy towards Communist China\\" that had been influenced by private talks between the Tunku and French President Charles de Gaulle. Ismail was outraged by this decision, which had been taken without consultation with him, and directly contradicted Ismail's stated policy of refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China as long as they backed the Malayan Communist Party, which had waged an armed insurgency against the government. Ismail threatened to resign, and apparently attempted to do so on four separate occasions. The situation was defused by the Tunku refusing to see Ismail, who eventually calmed down and put the incident behind him, behaving \\"as if nothing had happened.\\" Ismail was later persuaded by his brothers not to quit, but to instead transfer to a different ministry. He was then made the new internal security minister, a post which had been specifically created for him. In 1962, he was appointed to the portfolio of home affairs as well. In these roles, Ismail was in charge of detaining people under the controversial Internal Security Act (ISA), which permits detention without trial. After resigning in 1967, Ismail expressed amazement that he was not \\"the most hated man in Malaya\\" for his actions. Although many were critical of the ISA, Ismail believed it was necessary for public order, stating that \\"Abuse of the Act can be prevented by vigilant public opinion via elections, a free Press and above all the Parliament.\\" Malaysia In 1963, Malaya merged with the former British colonies of Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia. Ismail retained his cabinet positions in the new polity. During this period, despite no longer being in charge of external affairs, Ismail expressed strong support for an \\"Association of Southeast Asia\\", telling the media that \\"We look forward to a regional association embracing Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.\\" This proposal eventually became the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Ismail also presented Malaysia's case to the United Nations when Indonesia launched its armed \\"Confrontation\\" against the new polity, charging it with being the tool of neo-colonialists. Ismail managed to sneak a number of weapons captured from Indonesian military personnel into a meeting of the UN Security Council, greatly upsetting the Council's President, who asked him to remove them. Later, Ismail was a critic of Lee Kuan Yew, the Singaporean Prime Minister, for his attempt to de-emphasise race in Malaysian politics through the establishment of a non-racial political coalition, the Malaysian Solidarity Council (MSC). The resulting political controversy led to Singapore's separation from Malaysia; however, Ismail, like Toh Chin Chye, expressed his belief that Singapore and Malaysia would eventually merge once more, stating: \\"It is better to wait for this to come because if they do not do so they will sink together instead of coming together.\\" In 1966, Ismail became the first recipient of the First Class of the Darjah Yang Mulia Setia Mahkota Malaysia (The Most Esteemed Order of the Crown of Malaysia), entitling him to the title of Tun and the post-nominal SSM. Ismail resigned from his government posts in 1967, citing his poor health. A heart specialist had previously told him to retire from politics due to Ismail being \\"more sensitive to personality stresses than most people\\" ‚Äì advice Ismail said he would have ignored, had it not been for his five young children. The Tunku accepted Ismail's resignation, noting that he had previously forced Ismail's brother, Suleiman, to continue working in public service, with fatal results when Suleiman suddenly died. After retiring from politics, Ismail went on to head the Guthrie Group of Companies, where he was paid three times the amount earned by a cabinet minister.\\"The keeper of many secrets\\", p. 14. (5 January 2007). New Straits Times. 13 May In the 1969 general election, the Alliance suffered substantial losses. The MCA, which was hardest hit, decided to withdraw from the government as they felt they were no longer representative of the Chinese community. Ismail was very critical of this decision, and attempted to persuade the MCA President, Tan Siew Sin, to change his mind. Ismail warned that \\"this decision if not revoked would contribute to rioting and chaos in the country\\". On 13 May, after several controversial victory rallies were held by the victorious opposition, racial riots broke out in the federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's daughter later said that her father \\"remained calm, but took out his pistol, put it into his pocket, and went out with my mother to dinner\\". On the morning of 14 May, a police escort was dispatched by Tun Abdul Razak, the Deputy Prime Minister, to escort Ismail from his home. Ismail was persuaded to rejoin the government as home affairs minister.\\"Noted for uncompromising stand\\", p. 14. (4 January 2007). New Straits Times. The Tunku arranged a meeting of several of his top aides, including Ismail. At the meeting, Tun Abdul Razak expressed support for declaring martial law, but was dissuaded by General Ibrahim Ismail, who told him that \\"I cannot provide any guarantee (that I will) be able to hold back the members of the armed forces who might take over control of the government.\\" On 15 May, a state of emergency was declared and Parliament was suspended in favour of the National Operations Council (NOC), a body of top government officials. That day, Ismail announced to the media that \\"Democracy is dead in this country. It died at the hands of the opposition parties who triggered off the event leading to this violence.\\" Privately, Ismail accused the opposition parties of playing \\"communal politics\\", by using the Islamic party, PAS, to appeal to the extremist Malays, and using the ostensibly multiracial parties such as the Democratic Action Party and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia to appeal to the extremist Chinese. \\"Since the Alliance's policy is based on compromise,\\" he said, \\"it could not therefore please all the Malays or all the Chinese but could only please the moderate Malays and the understanding Chinese.\\" Ismail blamed the MCA as well, telling a friend that \\"it was with this tension, with this irresponsible decision by the MCA that the riot started\\". Tun Abdul Razak was initially interested in the possibility of a benevolent dictatorship, but was reportedly dissuaded by Ismail, who wanted to restore power to Parliament as soon as possible. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, future Prime Minister and then an aide to the NOC, later recalled that Tun Abdul Razak often took pains to accommodate Ismail's views, extending meetings whenever there was a clash of opinions so as to satisfy Ismail. Ismail's reputation for fairness but uncompromising toughness ‚Äì at one point, he declared he would arrest his own mother if she had broken the law ‚Äì has been cited by a number of top officials as greatly contributing to stability in the wake of the riots. During this period, several Malay \\"ultras\\" such as Mahathir bin Mohamad and Musa Hitam called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Mahathir penned an open letter to the Tunku, accusing him of \\"giving the Chinese what they demand ... you have given them too much face.\\" Soon, students at higher educational institutions across the country began to hold mass demonstrations, calling for the Tunku to step down in favour of a leader who would restore \\"Malay sovereignty\\". Sporadic rioting, believed to have been instigated by the Tunku's opponents, broke out. The Tunku responded by forcing Mahathir and Musa out of UMNO, while Ismail as Home Affairs Minister issued a statement: \\"These ultras believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities, regardless of the Constitution. ... Polarisation has taken place in Malaysian politics and the extreme racialists among the ruling party are making a desperate bid to topple the present leadership.\\"Means, Gordon P. (1991). Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation, pp. 8‚Äì10. Oxford University Press. . At the time, some suggested that Tun Abdul Razak was a power-hungry ultra, seeking to displace the Tunku as Prime Minister. Although this was denied by both the Tunku and Abdul Razak, there was great concern among non-Malays as to how the NOC's policy would affect them, as the NOC was chaired by Abdul Razak and not the Tunku. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, later finance minister, cited Ismail as a major factor in increasing public confidence in the government, stating: \\"The Chinese did not have much confidence in Razak, but they did in Ismail. Razak was always associated with Malay and rural affairs, et cetera. Ismail was a principled man ‚Äî and was seen that way by the different races. He was the Rock of Gibraltar. Once he decided on something you could be sure that he had gone through the relevant details and studied them. What is confidence unless it is based on the people‚Äôs belief in the leader?\\" Deputy Prime Minister In 1970, he was appointed as the second Deputy Prime Minister, replacing Tun Abdul Razak, who had been elevated to Prime Minister following the resignation of Tunku Abdul Rahman. Shortly before, Ismail had become privy to the secret that Abdul Razak was suffering from leukaemia. Only Razak's doctors, Razak and Ismail knew of Razak's health problems, with Razak often using the pretext of paying Ismail a visit at his home to be examined by doctors at a hidden building near Ismail's house. Not long after, Ismail himself discovered a lump in his neck while shaving ‚Äì the lump was later confirmed to be cancerous. As a result, many within Ismail's family urged him to retire again. However, Ismail considered it his duty to assist Abdul Razak as Deputy Prime Minister, and thus refused to resign, delaying the treatment for his neck cancer and refusing an operation on his heart valves to continue working. Around July 1973, Ismail suffered three heart attacks over the course of two weeks ‚Äì a secret he kept from his wife, who was expecting. Ismail told a friend that he planned to resign after Tun Abdul Razak returned from Ottawa in Canada, where he was attending the Commonwealth summit ‚Äì Ismail had promised to serve as acting Prime Minister while Razak was away. Ismail was also reportedly worried about Razak's political plans, as he intended to rehabilitate Mahathir ‚Äì a move opposed by Ismail, who preferred Musa Hitam to Mahathir.\\"Bound by duty to the last day\\", p. 25. (6 January 2007). New Straits Times. Death Eventually, fearing his impending death might keep him from providing for his family, Ismail decided to have his wife's pregnancy terminated. Shortly after, she underwent a tubal ligation. On 2 August, Ismail attended the silver jubilee celebrations of the Peninsular Malaysia Malay Students Foundation (Gabungan Pelajar-pelajar Melayu Semenanjung or GPMS). After a sudden explosion sound effect, Ismail's daughter (who was watching the event live on television) noticed he began to sweat profusely. Nevertheless, afterwards he visited his wife, who was recovering from the ligation, at the hospital as had been planned. After having his dinner, Ismail retired to his study. Later, he rang the bell for his maid, asking for his daughter and telling her that \\"I am going to die, please call my doctor and inform Gopal\\" (his private secretary). Ismail had suffered a massive heart attack. Normally, Dr Stewart C. Macpherson, a neighbour of Ismail's and personal doctor to him and Tun Razak, would have immediately attended to Ismail. However, Macpherson had accompanied Razak to the summit, forcing Ismail to phone his other doctor, Dr Catterall, who lived in the satellite town of Petaling Jaya. Upon arrival, Catterall immediately began efforts to resuscitate Ismail, soon being joined by the royal physician, Dr Pillai. Panicked Cabinet members soon arrived, and began discussing the future of politics without Ismail ‚Äì an incident Ismail's young son found disturbing as Ismail had yet to be declared dead. Catterall laboured for five hours to save Ismail, but to no avail. Ismail's official time of death was later pronounced as 10PM. Without Ismail, the country was momentarily leaderless, without an acting Prime Minister. Tun Razak ordered that he be laid in state at the Malaysian Houses of Parliament, and be buried at the Makam Pahlawan (Heroes' Mausoleum) near Masjid Negara (National Mosque), Kuala Lumpur. Ismail would be the first to be laid to rest there, and also the first recipient of a Malaysian state funeral. However, Works & Communications Minister Tun Sardon Jubir, the next-most senior Cabinet minister, ordered that Ismail lie in state at the Masjid Negara, and that he be buried just outside the Makam Pahlawan instead. As Ismail's body was transported from his home to the National Mosque, crowds thronged the streets. Razak was provided with a plane by the Canadian government that took him to Copenhagen, from where he took a commercial flight to Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's burial was postponed until his arrival. Upon arrival, finding that his instructions for Ismail's funeral had not been followed, Razak reportedly exclaimed to Ismail's widow, \\"Who am I to trust now?\\" Razak was particularly upset that the lying in state had been held in the National Mosque instead of the Houses of Parliament, as he had intended that non-Muslim Malaysians be able to view the lying in state without discomfort. Tun Sardon Jubir attempted to justify his instructions by citing a mufti who had informed him that Muslims could not be buried under a roof. The Tunku was exasperated by this explanation, remarking: \\"My forefathers are all buried in a mausoleum under a roof!\\" Razak, who would normally have overlooked such incidents, delayed the burial and brought in a detachment of soldiers to tear up the floor of the mausoleum, where Ismail was indeed laid to rest. Political views Ismail was particularly known for his non-ethnic approach to political issues. Expressing concern over racial polarisation in the country, he once asked: Although, according to his biographers, Ismail was \\"usually considered as a very good Malay leader...Ismail knew that Malaysia is full of non-Malays.\\" Unlike other UMNO politicians, Ismail avoided cultivating a political following: \\"He was there to build the country. That's it. He was actually a reluctant politician. So he wasn't a politician in the sense that he didn't cultivate 'my people'. He didn't care whether he made friends or not. That kind of person wasn't very popular\\". As Foreign Minister, Ismail pushed for non-alignment and non-interference in the internal affairs of ASEAN countries. He also supported the establishment of a central bank to quell foreign investment worries about a lack of independence in Malaysian monetary policy.Suhaini Aznam (21 January 2007).

It is conventionally held that his sudden death altered the course of Malaysian history ‚Äì Tun Abdul Razak appointed Tun Hussein Onn as his new deputy, and Hussein Onn would later appoint Mahathir as Deputy Prime Minister after succeeding Razak, setting Mahathir on the course towards becoming Prime Minister. Despite this, historians have often overlooked Ismail; one biographer of his has said that: Ismail's eldest son has suggested that Ismail was largely ignored because \\"Razak didn't want people to know about his illness and he didn't need a prop like Dr Ismail. He had to move out of Dr Ismail's shadow. My father didn't say he was controlling Razak, but people perceived he was doing so, including those who advised Razak.\\" Generally, Ismail has been regarded as reliable and incorruptible, \\"remembered for his deep dislike of incompetence and bigotry, his strict adherence to the virtues of hard work and honesty, and his belief in the principles of national independence and multi-racialism\\".

It uses a harness like a parachute harness and should have a strap between the legs (so the pilot does not fall out of the harness during flight). Some designs may use a ducted fan design to increase upward thrust. Several inventors have tried to make backpack helicopters, with mixed results. Typically, a backpack helicopter differs from a conventional helicopter in two main ways: First, there is no tail rotor, and the main rotors are contra-rotating. Yaw is controlled by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the rotor drive transmission. When one rotor is adjusted to spin slightly faster than the other, it induces yaw (turning motion). Second, the rotors are fixed pitch, which assists with simplicity; this means, however, that in the event of engine failure autorotation is impossible. Usually, a ballistic parachute would be incorporated for safety. An edition of Popular Science magazine in 1969 featured a backpack helicopter that used small jet engines in a tip jet configuration instead of contra-rotating rotors. This design could function in autorotation. Related are devices like a backpack helicopter which also include a seat and leg supports, which are small, open-topped helicopters. In theory, a helicopter would be more efficient than a rocket-powered jetpack, possessing a greater specific impulse, and being more suited to hovering, due to the lower velocities of the propelled gases.

The famous Sree Valayanad Devi Temple in Kozhikode one of the rate \\"Saktheya Temples\\" where pooja is performed in accordance with practice of \\"Rurujit\\" worship. Temple history Sree Valayanad Bagavathy is the family deity of Zamorin Swaroopam. Despite the great army and financial strength of the Zamorin Raja he could not subjugate Valluvakkonathiri who as his political foe in their struggle for power. The Zamorin who could not win his battle against Valluvakkonathiri understood that the reason for his failure in the battle was due to Valluvakkonathiri's high spiritual strength. Valluvakkonathiri acquired this power because of his intense worship of Devi. Therefore, the Zamorin Raja also started worshipping Devi intensely. Devi was immensely pleased with the Zamorin and appeared before him. The Zamorin pleaded with the Devi to come over his place and settle there Devi who agreed to do so was ceremoniously led to his place and consecrated at Valayanad in Kozhikode. After this he worshipped Devi permanently from Valayanad. This is the traditional belief relating to this temple.

Hendrickson is best known for her discovery of the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex in South Dakota on August 12, 1990. Her discovery was one of the most complete skeletons of Tyrannosaurus known to science. This skeleton is now known as \\"Sue\\" in honor of her discovery. It is on display at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. She has also found other important fossils and artifacts around the world. Early life Hendrickson was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Lee and Mary Hendrickson; her family soon moved to nearby Munster, Indiana, where she grew up. She has two siblings: an older brother, John, and her younger sister, Karen. Her father was a successful railroad purchasing agent, while her mother worked at American Airlines. In 1955, Hendrickson was enrolled at Munster's public elementary, frequently being praised by her teachers as \\"a good student and obedient child\\". However, she eventually found herself bored with school in Munster, and at age 16 was able to convince her parents to let her stay with her aunt in Florida, where she enrolled at a Fort Lauderdale high school. An adventurous and rebellious teenager, Hendrickson never completed high school, dropping out at the age of 17 in favor of moving from state to state with her boyfriend before settling in Florida, where she was hired by two professional divers who owned an aquarium fish business. A strong swimmer who had once been on her high school's swim team, Hendrickson quickly learned to dive and began collecting tropical fish off the Florida Keys to sell to aquarists and pet stores. Aside from her work as a diver, Hendrickson also worked part of the year as a lobster fisherman, and would occasionally take the summer off to volunteer on paleontological digs. She later moved to Seattle, earned her GED, and considered enrolling at the University of Washington in order to pursue a marine biology degree, but decided against it, leaving Seattle after a year and moving back to Florida to continue her diving career. Career In 1963, Hendrickson had a large circle of friends in the diving business, and one day was invited to participate in a salvage diving expedition off the Florida Keys, which she eagerly undertook. Her job was to retrieve valuable building materials that were stored in a cargo freighter which ran aground on a coral reef. While continuing her work in salvage, Hendrickson soon found herself exploring old shipwrecks, later visiting the Dominican Republic. She was fascinated by working in the company of archeologists and fell in love with the country, visiting the island often. By the mid-1980s, Hendrickson had also tried her hand at amber mining in the Dominican mountains. She had become one of the largest amber providers for scientists. Hendrickson also found three perfect 23-million-year-old butterflies, which make up half of the whole world's total collection. Although she found the work too monotonous to pursue full-time, writing that \\"You could dig for months and find nothing in the Dominican caves,\\" she continued studying paleoentomology, becoming an expert at identifying fossilized insects. T. rex specimen discovered by Sue Hendrickson She also met Swiss paleontologist Kirby Siber, who allowed her to join his team consisting of paleontologists Carlos Martin and Peter Larson. The group began excavating Miocene baleen whale fossils at an ancient seabed in Peru, and Hendrickson joined the team for several summers, discovering fossilized dolphins, seals, and sharks. She later accompanied Larson to the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota. By this time, paleontology had become her main passion. On August 12, 1990, while examining a cliff-side in South Dakota with a team from the Black Hills Institute, she discovered an important Tyrannosaurus rex specimen ‚Äì the largest, most complete, and best preserved T. rex ever found. The find would later be named \\"Sue\\" in her honor. In 1992, Hendrickson joined a team of marine archaeologists headed by Franck Goddio. With them, she took part in many diving expeditions, the most notable of which were the Royal Quarters of Cleopatra, and Napoleon Bonaparte's lost fleet from the Battle of the Nile. In 2005, Glamour magazine honored her in their \\"Glamour Woman of the Year Awards\\". In 2010, she published an autobiography entitled Hunt for the Past: My Life as an Explorer (New York, NY: Scholastic, Inc). In 2008, she was featured on the \\"Dare to Explore\\" chapter of National Geographic Kids. Hendrickson now lives on the island of Guanaja, off the coast of Honduras. She is a member of the Paleontological Society, Explorers Club, Society for Historical Archaeology, and was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2000.

The network was available on cable providers in much of upstate New York (stretching from Buffalo to Albany), as well as parts of northern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. The network ceased operations on March 7, 2005, in the midst of Adelphia's financial collapse and bankruptcy. History Empire Sports Network launched on December 31, 1990; its first broadcast that evening was a National Hockey League game between the Buffalo Sabres and the Philadelphia Flyers. Founded by John Rigas (founder and chief executive officer of network parent Adelphia Communications), the idea for Empire Sports was first conceived in 1989; Rigas decided to operate the new network in Buffalo, instead of in Adelphia's corporate homebase of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, a rural borough dozens of miles away from the nearest major sports teams. Originally broadcasting as a part-time service for four hours each night from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., the network originally carried games from the Sabres (carrying locally televised games not broadcast on Fox affiliate WUTV (channel 29), which carried the team's games under a separate contract), the Buffalo Bisons of the International League and Major League Baseball games from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Empire was an outgrowth of the Niagara Frontier Sports Network (NFSN), a partnership between the Sabres and Adelphia that had carried Sabres games on cable on a part-time basis through much of the 1980s. Adelphia launched the network without seeking a specified carriage fee rate, offering Empire Sports to cable providers for free on a \\"good faith\\" basis. However, in June 1991, Tele-Communications Inc. briefly dropped the network from its systems in New York state, after TCI decided against carrying it without a firm carriage agreement. In October 1991, the network became an affiliate of the Prime Network group of regional sports networks; at that time, the network expanded its programming schedule to 19 hours per day, operating from 5:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. On August 10, 1994, Empire acquired the exclusive regional television rights to the Sabres; as part of the deal, Empire also struck a deal with WUTV parent Act III Broadcasting to air over-the-air simulcasts of ten regular season games (a third of the 30 games that the station had been carrying under a separate contract with the team) and any playoff games during the term of the agreement. By 1995, Empire had expanded its carriage to TCI systems in Rochester and Syracuse; the network expanded its statewide coverage eastward to Albany and Binghamton. The next year, 1996, saw the Prime Network converted to Fox Sports Net, and Empire thus became an FSN affiliate, airing nationally provided sports programming from Fox and in turn contributing footage to FSN shows such as Fox Sports News. The Sabres' relationship with Empire Sports strengthened in 1998, when Adelphia and the Rigas family purchased the team. Following the purchase, the network expanded its coverage of the team, culminating in the Sabres' advancement to the Stanley Cup Finals in May 1999, when it provided 12 hours of coverage daily from 12:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. during the championship series. The network's unbridled coverage of the Sabres caught the attention of the National Hockey League, with league Commissioner Gary Bettman commenting that \\"if the rest of the league was covered like Empire Sports covers the Sabres, we would be as big as the NFL.\\" By 2001, Empire Sports had over 6.7 million subscribers via both cable providers in New York, northern Pennsylvania and northeastern Ohio and nationally on satellite. Between October 2000 and March 2004, Adelphia, under vice president/general manager Bob Koshinski, used staff from Empire to operate Wethersfield radio station WNSA (107.7 FM). The station overtook WGR (550 AM) as the ratings leader among the Buffalo market's two sports radio stations in the spring of 2001, but subsequently lost several of its talent, including prominent afternoon host Mike Schopp, to WGR when the Rigas/Adelphia scandal broke. Collapse Empire Sports thrived until March 2002, when the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating accusations of internal corruption and securities violations by Adelphia executives (including John Rigas and his son, chief operating officer Timothy Rigas), leading up to the company's subsequent bankruptcy filing, as Adelphia was mired in off-balance-sheet debt totaling $2.3 billion. With Adelphia in freefall and under temporary bank- appointed management, Empire was unable to renew its carriage agreement with Time Warner Cable, its largest non-Adelphia customer and the primary cable provider for nearly all of upstate New York, in the fall of 2002; TWC continued to carry Empire on its Syracuse system for eight months without a carriage deal in place, later announcing plans to replace it with the Outdoor Life Network on May 1, 2003. Empire Sports and Time Warner Cable struck an agreement in April 2003, which would significantly reduce its coverage by migrating the network from TWC's analog service to a digital sports tier in Syracuse and Binghamton. The network continued to operate, but was dealt another severe blow in 2003 when Adelphia's board of directors appointed William Schleyer as its new chief executive officer and Ron Cooper as its chief operating officer. With questions surrounding whether Adelphia was even still interested in being in the lucrative regional sports business and if Empire Sports would survive its parent's ongoing collapse, the company laid off 27 full-time employees and all freelancers on August 19. The staff cuts forced Empire to immediately eliminate the popular news/call-in show Fan TV, but the network itself was still able to survive for another eighteen months. The lockout that wiped out the entire 2004‚Äì05 NHL season served both as a blessing and a death blow. Financially, the lockout benefited the network because it was not required to pay the Sabres its annual rights fee of $9.5 million. The Sabres had acted as a loss leader for Empire, and without them, the network had no core programming (incidentally, Empire Sports nearly lost the Sabres telecasts when its previous broadcast deal expired in 2003; however, due to the absence of other offers, the Sabres chose against exercising an option to pay Adelphia $1 million to terminate its agreement with the network). Further complicating matters, Time Warner later decided to drop Empire from its systems in Syracuse, Rochester and Binghamton on December 1, 2004, leaving Empire available only in Western New York and the city of Utica, although it remained on the sports tier packages of DirecTV and Dish Network across the country. Howard Simon's radio-TV simulcast show was among the last local programs (other than the nightly sports report) that aired on the network. From the time Adelphia decided to sell WNSA, the network also streamed online until the closing of its sale to Entercom Communications, which purchased the station in May 2004 for $10.3 million; when the station was sold, Empire Sports merely switched the Internet stream from WNSA to Empire's feed. Empire's partnership with WNSA ended in the fall of 2004, when Entercom switched its format to classic rock under the brand \\"107.7 The Lake\\". Simon's show, however, continued on WLVL (1340 AM) in Lockport until November 2004, when he was recruited to host WGR's morning show. Under the watch of Schleyer and Cooper, on January 24, 2005, Adelphia announced that would shut down Empire Sports on March 7, instead of selling it to several interested parties, citing severe financial losses. Adelphia resisted offers from outside interests to purchase Empire ‚Äì including a $17 million cash bid by Joshua Pollack (a native of Buffalo and founder of New York City-based media company NXT Communications), a failed bids by the Hamister group (which would have also included the Sabres) and the Buffalo Bills was also interested in purchasing Empire Sports ‚Äì desiring instead to pocket the retransmission consent fees (totaling an average of $1.98 per subscriber) that would have gone to Empire's new owner had the network been sold off. Tom Golisano and Larry Quinn decided against buying Empire Sports in their purchase of the Sabres. Despite concerns from viewers and local political leaders, Adelphia announced on January 19, 2005, that it would shut down Empire altogether. On January 23, the network laid off all but two of its 30 employees. The network cancelled its original programming, replacing it with a continuous tape loop, showing highlights from the network's history. Empire signed off for good on March 7, 2005, with Adelphia replacing it on its former analog channel slot on its Western New York systems with the NFL Network. Aftermath Adelphia was acquired by Time Warner Cable and Comcast, which completed the asset transfer and division on August 1, 2006. CEO William Schleyer received a bonus of $15 million and COO Ron Cooper received $9 million as part of their compensation package from the re-structured Adelphia Board of Directors. After Empire's contract with the team expired, the Buffalo Sabres signed a new cable rights agreement with New York City-based MSG Network, where the team's games remain to this day; however, the broadcasts are still produced by the Sabres organization as they were during the duration of its agreement with Empire. Syracuse University maintains an agreement with what was then Time Warner Cable for extensive local coverage of its teams, the result of which was the creation of what was originally Time Warner Sports 26 and would eventually end its life as Spectrum Sports, a sports network that covers most of Empire's old territory and operated out of Empire's old studios in West Seneca. Some of Empire's sports rights, such as the handful of Bisons games that aired on the network, ended up being acquired by WNGS (channel 67), before ending up back in Time Warner's hands after WNGS briefly came under the operation of a religious organization; WNGS, now rechristened as WBBZ-TV, originally indicated it would make a greater push for sports rights after being revived as a commercial, locally owned station (indeed, WBBZ hired Koshinski as an executive producer in 2012). Ultimately, WBBZ abandoned most of its sports broadcasts in 2015 when Koshinski left the station. Spectrum Sports shut down operations in 2017. Terrence Pegula, who purchased the Sabres and Bills in the early 2010s, raised the possibility of launching an in-house regional sports network when the Sabres' contract with MSG ended after the 2016‚Äì17 season. Rather than go through the process of building a team-owned network from scratch, in June 2016, it was announced that Pegula had reached a deal to expand its relationship with MSG by forming a regional opt-out of MSG Network known as MSG Western New York, which is co-owned by Pegula and carries additional local studio programming covering the Bills and Sabres. Zito Media, the company established by the Rigas family to replace Adelphia, has not re- entered the regional sports network market. Empire's Web site remained live but abandoned for 13 years after the network's closure, in part to prevent a fake news website of the same name from claiming the domain. The empiresports.com domain was eventually transferred to a marketing firm in Dublin, Ohio. Programming The network was the flagship station for Buffalo Sabres NHL games, however it also aired collegiate sports (particularly those involving Syracuse University), and several sports news and talk shows. Empire also aired a significant number of programs covering the National Football League's Buffalo Bills; live play-by-play of the Arena Football League's Buffalo Destroyers, the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball, the Buffalo Bisons, Rochester Red Wings and Syracuse Chiefs of the AAA International League; AHL hockey; and NCAA basketball. Buffalo Bandits lacrosse also received limited coverage on the network. Empire also aired NBA games featuring the Toronto Raptors for several seasons until January 2005, when all original and live programming on the network was discontinued. In its latter years, the network also aired live Canadian Football League games on Friday nights and tape delayed telecasts on Saturday mornings. Some of Empire's programs included Fan TV, a daily 2¬Ω-hour late-afternoon sports news and call-in program hosted by Howard Simon and Jim Brinson) and its successor, The SimonCast; the Empire Sports Report, a nightly sportscast hosted by Mike DeGeorge, Josh Mora and Jason Bristol; and Hockey Hotline, the Sabres' post- game report hosted by NHL veteran Mike Robitaille and later with Brian Blessing. Other popular shows included Fan Forum with Bob Koshinski, which aired from 1991 to 1998 and Pros and Cons (a predecessor to Pardon the Interruption that featured WGRZ-TV sports director Ed Kilgore pitted against contrarian and WGR radio host Art Wander, with Buffalo News sports editor Larry Felser moderating), which ran from 1992 to 1996. As an affiliate of first the Prime Network and then Fox Sports Net, Empire also carried nationally oriented programming from those networks. Former Bills punter Paul Maguire (now an NFL analyst for ESPN) also hosted the Budweiser Sportsline on the network during the NFL season; Pete Weber and Danny Gare (who both currently work as NHL announcers) also worked for Empire along with former Buffalo Bill Steve Tasker (now of CBS). Van Miller lent his voice to several college basketball games on Empire during the early years of the network. The network also aired ECW Hardcore TV produced by Extreme Championship Wrestling, a now-defunct professional wrestling promotion based in Philadelphia.

Some of its stores used the names Pharmhouse and Rx Place (purchased in the mid-1990s from the F.W. Woolworth Company). Low prices were advertised to bring in a large volume of sales with the slogans \\"Phar-Mor power buying gives you Phar-Mor buying power\\" and \\"Phar-Mor For Less.\\" Another common slogan in their TV commercials was \\"Power buying saves: Save at Phar- Mor.\\" In 1996, the Green Bay, Wisconsin-based regional discount store chain ShopKo announced a plan to merge with Phar-Mor, but withdrew from the plan a year later, citing irreconcilable differences.  Business model  Phar-Mor's business model was based on selling a large quantity of merchandise with a very small profit margin. Many products were shipped via direct store delivery, but some were shipped through Tamco warehouses, which Phar-Mor later purchased. Sam Walton once called Monus the only retailer that he feared, since he couldn't understand how Phar-Mor grew so rapidly in a short time.Farrey, Tom. Souls of the departed haunt Youngstown. ESPN, 2004-11-12. Bankruptcy In 1992, when the company had grown to over 300 stores and 25,000 employees,Phar-Mor can pay employees Monus and his CFO Patrick Finn were accused of embezzlement: they had allegedly hidden losses and moved about $10 million from Phar-Mor to the World Basketball League that Monus had founded. Based on deceptive data and inventory, Phar-Mor borrowed millions, ostensibly to finance its unusually rapid growth. In actuality, this infusion of cash was necessary to pay off suppliers. As a result, Phar-Mor had to file for bankruptcy protection, closed 55 stores and laid off 5,000 employees. Finn testified against Monus and received 33 months in prison. Monus' first trial ended in a hung jury in 1994; he was convicted at the second trial on 107 federal counts, mostly related to fraud, and sentenced to 17 years and 7 months in federal prison. Prosecutors estimated that the total loss to all investors exceeded $1 billion. The sentence was appealed and later reduced to nine years. Several investors in Phar-Mor filed a civil suit against the company's auditors, Coopers & Lybrand. A jury decided in 1996 that the accountants committed common law and federal securities law fraud by falsely representing they had performed GAAS audits when in fact they had failed to do so. Phar-Mor emerged from bankruptcy protection in January 1995 with 143 stores remaining, only to be hit hard once again by competition from other large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, which began opening new stores with pharmacies. Phar-Mor, unable to compete, was forced into bankruptcy for the second time in September 2001, only about six and a half years after it had emerged from its prior three-year-long bankruptcy. The company was delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market on October 10, 2001. Phar-Mor became weaker during its last years of business. The company tried to return to its Power Buying concept before it had filed for bankruptcy, but to no avail. Without Power Buying, Phar-Mor found itself directly competing with CVS and Walgreens, and lost out because of other chains' convenient locations. Phar- Mor's second bankruptcy was eventually to result in its total liquidation. In July 2002, a judge in Youngstown approved the sale of Phar-Mor Inc.'s $141 million in assets and inventory. Going-out-of-business sales began at the pharmacy chain's remaining 73 stores. Liquidation of Phar-Mor's inventory was handled by The Ozer Group of Needham, Massachusetts and Hilco Merchant Resources of Northbrook, Illinois. Its Youngstown-area assets were purchased by Giant Eagle in bankruptcy court. The case was featured in an episode of the PBS show Frontline, entitled \\"How to Steal $500 Million\\". The stores in the Youngstown area were eventually sold to Marc's, another discount grocery drugstore chain.  References  * Marianne M.

Biography In 1990, Allison met singer Lara Fabian in a piano-bar in Brussels. They started writing their first songs together and went to Montr√©al in 1991 to work on Fabian's first album. This record came out in 1991 in Canada and was a huge commercial success. Allison produced Fabian's following francophone albums Carpe Diem, Pure and Nue, all of which performed very well and spawned several hit singles in Canada and French-speaking Europe. He also worked on her first English-language album Lara Fabian. All together, he sold more than 25 million records. For the Eurovision Song Contest in 2002, Allison wrote the music for the French entry, \\"Il faut du temps\\" by Sandrine Fran√ßois. That same year, he contributed three songs on Johnny Hallyday's album √Ä la vie, √† la mort, including the single Pense √† moi. Allison had another major success when he produced Chim√®ne Badi's debut album Entre nous in 2003. The single of the same name topped the French Singles Chart. Later on he worked with other young female singers, including Nolwenn Leroy, Julie Zenatti and √âlodie Fr√©g√©. In 2004, Allison and Fabian, who had been a couple in real life, broke up and also ended their professional relationship. This was followed by a series of legal battles over the use of the copyright of Fabian's songs.

The Center for Individual Freedom has led efforts to defeat efforts to compel \\"dark money\\" groups like it from being forced to reveal their donors. It won a big victory in September 2012 when a U.S. appeals court overturned a lower court decision that increased disclosure requirements. Despite this, Mother Jones reported in April 2012 that the Center for Individual Freedom had been given $2.75 million from Crossroads GPS, the conservative non-profit started by Karl Rove. Paul Ryan, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center (a group in favor of campaign finance regulation), says CFIF's anti-disclosure cases are without merit but adds that challenging disclosure laws is a new attempt to deregulate campaign finance. In the 2010 elections CFIF spent $2.5 million supporting Republican candidates, and in the 2012 elections it spent $1.9 million.

These include Hisense, Toshiba, Gorenje, Kelon and Ronshen. Hisense is also an OEM, so some of the products it makes are sold to other manufacturers and carry a brand name not related to Hisense. The main products of Hisense are televisions; their first TV model CJD18 was produced in 1978.Annual report 2017 p. 9, Simplified Chinese It has invented a type of transparent television in 2013. In 2015 it acquired the right to sell televisions in the Americas using the brand name of the Japanese firm Sharp. In 2020, it introduced the world's first true 8K 10 bit HDR screen TV that is based on an AI-powered HDR algorithm and an image quality engine claiming 6.5T supercomputing power. With more than 80,000 employees world-wide Hisense Group has 14 industrial parks, which are located in Qingdao, Shunde, Huzhou, Czech Republic, South Africa, Mexico and so on. There are also 18 R&D; centers located in Qingdao, Shenzhen, USA, Germany, Israel, etc.Timeline Hisense Official Site History In September 1969, Qingdao No.2 Radio Factory, the predecessor of Hisense Group, was established.This was the year its existence was first officially recognized. This small factory's first product was a radio sold under the brand name Red Lantern, but the company later acquired the know-how to make TVs through a trial-production of black and white televisions ordered by the Shandong National Defense Office. This involved the technical training of three employees at another Chinese factory, Tianjin 712, and resulted in the production of 82 televisions by 1971 and the development of transistor TVs by 1975. Television production in China was limited until 1979 when a Beijing meeting of the Ministry of Electronics called for greater development of the civil-use electronics industry. Qingdao No.2 Radio Factory was then quickly merged with other local electronics makers and began to manufacture televisions under the name Qingdao General Television Factory in Shandong province. Color televisions were manufactured through the purchase of a production line from Matsushita, the first of many such technology transfers from foreign firms Hisense has made in order to remain competitive. The companies it has bought from include Hitachi, Lucent, Matsushita, NEC, Sanyo, Toshiba, and Qualcomm. The Hisense Group emerged in 1994 from a tumult started in 1992 by then-president Zhou Houjian or perhaps even by Li Dezhen, director of the Electronic Instrument Bureau of Qingdao. The Hisense Electrical Appliance Share Holding Company (now, Hisense Electrical Co Ltd) was publicly listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in April 1997. Increased competition and price wars in the Chinese electronics market in the 1990s were a boon to Hisense, which acquired ten failing enterprises by 1998. Eager to expand beyond consumer electronics, Hisense Group aimed to also become a regional leader in household appliances, computers and communications. This strategy prompted great outlays of capital on R&D; and on the creation of industrial parks, etc. In July 2015, Hisense bought a Mexico facility from Sharp for $23.7 million alongside rights to use the Sharp brand on televisions sold in North and South America. In November 2017, Hisense announced that it would acquire a 95% controlling stake in Toshiba Visual Solutions for US$113 million. In 2018, Hisense became the majority shareholder in Slovenian appliance manufacturer Gorenje with 95.4% of shares.

In June 2017, Hisense was sued by Sharp under its new owner Foxconn, seeking to have the licence agreement halted. Sharp accused Hisense of damaging its brand equity by utilizing its trademarks on products it deemed to be \\"shoddily manufactured\\", including those that it believed to have violated U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and deceptive advertising of their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and \\"will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands.\\" In February 2018 Sharp dropped the lawsuit.

The first locomotives built for the new gauge railways were two E class double Fairlies for the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway Company. The F class was the first class ordered by the central government, and between 1872 and 1888, a total of eighty-eight members of the class were constructed.  Design  The F class was a tank locomotive with a wheel arrangement of 0-6-0. They operated essentially everywhere on New Zealand's railway network doing a variety of jobs. F class locomotives could haul light passenger trains at speeds up to or pull up to 800 tonnes of freight on flat trackage. Originally the design was meant for use on the Southland Railways, and three prototypes were built by Neilsons of Glasgow in 1872; among these was what would become F 13, now preserved at the Ferrymead Railway in Christchurch. The engines were originally given names from the works of Sir Walter Scott by order of a Government official. Originally some had New Zealand names; for example F 36 (later F 13) was originally named Clutha, and later renamed Edie Ochiltree. Some were at times classified as the O class as these had Cartazzi axles, but by the nationwide renumbering of 1890 all were classified F. By this time none of the engines carried names any more. In service The F class had originally been conceived as a mainline mixed-traffic tank locomotive, and their capabilities exceeded the expectation of even Charles Rous-Marten, who wrote of having observed them in all manner of duties while in New Zealand. As time went on and lines were extended, it became clear that the F class could no longer keep running as it did on the mainline, and so larger engines were introduced, thus pushing the F class to branchline and shunting duties. The class is unique in that it has been used on every line in New Zealand to be operated by the New Zealand Railways, and indeed, some operated by the Public Works Department. Several were also owned by the Westport Harbour Board, whose assets were later acquired by the NZR. In all, a total of 88 were acquired by the Government and by various private railways, notably the Westport Harbour Board and the Thames Valley & Rotorua Railway (TVRR). Not all of the 88 locomotives were in NZR service at one time. One locomotive, Neilson 1842, was sold to the Public Works Department before the nationwide numbering scheme of 1890 was implemented. Another twelve locomotives were rebuilt as FA class 0-6-2T tank locomotives. This ensured that only 75 engines of the type were in service with the NZR at any one time, given the length of the period over which NZR acquired these engines. By the 1940s, the F class were in retreat with the largest concentrations being on Christchurch, Invercargill, and Greymouth, where they were still used for shunting duties. The Christchurch locomotives were retained to shunt the Lyttelton wharves (their short wheel- base gave them a greater operational flexibility), while the Invercargill locomotives were retained as shunters and also to shunt a dairy factory siding at Edendale; here, a verandah beside the siding limited clearances and the F class were the only locomotives able to negotiate this siding without any trouble.New Zealand Railfan, Triple M Publications, March 2009. From this period onwards, many of the locomotives were replaced with the arrival of the DS class 0-6-0DM diesel locomotives. The Invercargill locomotives were gone by the end of the 1950s, as were the two Greymouth examples, F 5 and F 277, which were dumped at Omoto, 2 km from Greymouth, along with other withdrawn locomotives and wagons in an attempt to control erosion of the railway embankment at Omoto by the Grey River. The last allocation for the F class was at Lyttelton, where their short wheelbase allowed them to run over the sharp curves on the wharves. The last two in service, F 13 and F 163, were withdrawn in 1963. Prior to this, both locomotives were overhauled and repainted in an approximation of the green livery used in the 1870s and named Peveril (F 13) and Ivanhoe (F 163) respectively. After taking part in the NZR centenary celebrations at the Christchurch Railway Station in 1963, both were placed in the Arthur's Pass locomotive shed with W 192 for safekeeping. In 1968, NZR donated F 13 to the NZR&LS; Canterbury Branch for their Ferrymead Railway, and it was steamed from Arthur's Pass to Christchurch with a special excursion train. Industrial service The F class was one of the most versatile locomotives in NZR service, and this was also true of these locomotives in industrial service. As larger and more powerful locomotives started to displace the F class from regular service, many were sold into industrial service, working at coal mines, sawmills, and freezing works. Following the withdrawal of F 13 and F 163 in 1963, one could still find an F class locomotive at work in the bush or at a coal mine. The F class, while a success on the NZR network, was not so much of a success on the roughly-laid bush tramways of New Zealand. Being heavier than the older A, C, and D class tank locomotives used on bush trams before, operators who used F class locomotives had to upgrade the standard of their track to accommodate these locomotives. Despite this, the locomotives were relatively reliable, and some were fitted with extra bunkers behind their cabs to increase their small fuel capacity. The other applications where the F class found a useful second life were at freezing works and coal mines. Here, the locomotives were used as shunters, and in the case of coal mines, to run trains of empty NZR wagons to the loading bins and loaded wagons back to the NZR connection. These lines were usually of a higher standard than the bush tramways, and so no track modifications were required to accommodate these useful engines. As the locomotives were particularly suited to conversion to petrol or diesel power, several locomotives were rebuilt as diesel locomotives when their boilers expired. The Auckland Farmers Freezing Company (AFFCo) had three such steam to diesel conversions, one at Moerewa, one at Auckland's Export Wharf, and another at Horotiu, in the 1960s, while Butler Bros. sawmill at Ruatapu on the West Coast had another.  Withdrawal  The final F class locomotives in regular service worked as shunters into the 1960s, the last being those used to shunt the Lyttelton wharves until the arrival of the second batch of DS class 0-6-0DM diesel shunters arrived in 1953. Other members of the class survived into the 1950s after being sold to industries to operate private lines. By 1968 the class was extinct in NZR ownership with the exception of F 163, retained for nostalgic purposes. The majority of the class was scrapped between the late 1940s and late 1960s as diesel traction took over their traditional duties and younger steam locomotives were cascaded down onto shunting work, which the F class excelled at. The last strongholds of the class were Southland and Lyttelton - at Lyttelton the engines shunted the wharves, while in Southland, the Southland Dairy Co-operative required an F class engine to shunt its Edendale works as these were the only engines that could pass a verandah that stood too close to the tracks for other types to be able to safely shunt the siding. Two Greymouth engines, F 5 and F 277, were dumped at Omoto in 1957 following their withdrawal. F 277 was unique in that it had a larger cab than the standard engines. Another two locomotives were dumped at Oamaru Locomotive Dump in 1930 but their identities have not been proven as the locomotives have since been pulled into the harbour by the undertow. The last three F class engines in service were engines F 13 and F 163 in Christchurch, and F 180 at Eastown Workshops. In 1965, F 180 was named Meg Merrilies (which supposedly was the engine's original name, though this has not been verified), and donated to the Museum of Transport and Technology. F 13 and F 163 were both painted in green and named Peveril and Ivanhoe respectively, and used in 1963 for the NZR's centenary celebrations. Neither was withdrawn until 1965, when F 163 was placed in storage at Arthur's Pass with W 192. F 13, meanwhile, was donated to the NZR&LS; Canterbury Branch in 1968. In 1985, F163 was transferred to Palmerston North and was overhauled by off-duty NZR workers and railfans to ready the engine for the centenary of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway. It then spent another decade based at Palmerston North, before being transferred to Feilding. F163 is the sole member of the once 88-strong class to be certified for mainline running. Overseas use C 1 on display at Perth railway station, 1956. Note the similarity to the NZR F class including the cab coal bunkers which were retained during the conversion. The 3' 6\\" gauge Rio Tinto Railway of Spain ordered two similar locomotives from Neilson in 1875, works numbers 1950/51. A third locomotive of this type, Neilson 3611, was ordered in 1887. Although largely the same as the NZR locomotives, they had a larger cylinder diameter.Petrie, Gerald, In the Beginning: The Story of the New Zealand Locomotive 1863-1877, Locomotive Press 1996. p. 163. None of these locomotives have survived. Two more locomotives were built by Stephensons to this design, as their works numbers 2391/92, in 1880 for the Western Australian Government Railways as their C class. These locomotives were a direct match to the NZR F class and received the numbers C1 and C2 respectively. Due to their small fuel capacity they were later rebuilt with two-axle tenders and modified cabs to become 0-6-0STT. It has been suggested by one railway website that the conversion of C1 was in fact due to an accident sustained in the period 1885-87. Both locomotives worked around Perth until the early 1900s, by which time C1 had been sold in 1899 to a sawmill. It last steamed in 1940 but was purchased by WAGR in 1956 and restored at their Midland Workshops before being placed on display at the Perth railway station. It has since moved into preservation with the Australian Railway Historical Society at their Bassendean Railway Museum.  Preserved locomotives  Nine examples of the class have been preserved, including several in full running order: * F 12 - Ferrymead Railway, unrestored, used for spare parts. The locomotive is owned by the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society. The cab is owned by the Ocean Beach Railway, Dunedin for use on F 111, and the rest of the locomotive is stored in the carriage shed at Ferrymead as a source of spare parts for F 13. * F 13 - Ferrymead Railway, from the original batch of five built in 1872; in service. The locomotive returned to steam in late 2014 and is now in regular service at Ferrymead. * F 111 - Ocean Beach Railway, under restoration. The engine requires a new boiler before it can steam again. * F 150 - The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum, unrestored. This engine is owned by the Ocean Beach Railway, but leased to the Ashburton Railway & Preservation Society. * F 163 - Feilding and District Steam Rail Society, operational. This locomotive is owned by the Rail Heritage Trust but leased to F&DSRS.; F 163 is currently mainline certified and is the only F class locomotive to have this certification. * F 180 - Meg Merrilies Museum of Transport and Technology, Operational. Last ran on NZR 1966. This engine was completed in 2018 after a long term restoration , first ran in preservation in the 19th of August 2018. * F 185 - Bush Tramway Club, stored. This engine was donated to the BTC by the State Mines Department in 1972. * Hamilton Lake Rotoroa Reserve F 230 - Hamilton Lake Rotoroa Reserve, static display. This engine was donated by Ellis & Burnand to the City of Hamilton in 1956 after working at E&B;'s Mangapehi sawmill for ten years. Its boiler was filled with concrete and some of the locomotive's parts were removed including the fireman's side rods and more recently in the early 2000s, the trailing side- rod on the driver's side which has converted the locomotive to an impromptu 0-4-2ST. The information board on the rear of the cab says F230 worked at Palmerston North, Napier and Wellington, before being sold to Napier Harbour Board in 1933 and Ellis & Burnand in 1945. It says it was \\"in complete working trim\\" when moved to the park. * F 233 - Glenbrook Vintage Railway, awaiting restoration. Owned by the Railway Enthusiasts Society, and formerly displayed at their Onehunga clubrooms. Four other F class locomotives were preserved as diesel-powered conversions: * F 40 - Bay of Islands Vintage Railway, chassis only. The remains of this locomotive have largely been scrapped. * F 162 - Museum of Transport and Technology, chassis only. * F 216 - Bush Tramway Club, Pukemiro. This was the last F class engine built in 1888. * F 228 - Museum of Transport and Technology, chassis only.

On August 29, 2005 the storm surge from the hurricane caused massive failure in the levees along the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal, inundating St. Bernard Parish with of water. The Murphy Oil refinery was flooded with of water, and a above-ground storage tank at the refinery was dislodged from its moorings and damaged in the flooding. At the time, the tank contained approximately of mixed crude oil; a breach in the tank's side wall released up to , though the pressure from the floodwaters kept the oil inside of the tank until the waters had receded to about , five days after the storm had passed. As the oil was released, it mixed with the floodwaters and flowed from east to west. The spoiled water impacted approximately 1,700 homes in adjacent residential neighborhoods of Chalmette, over an area of about .

The Murphy Oil USA spill was the exception. Preparations Contractor hosing down the sides of a canal in Chalmette to remove oil Major industries in St. Bernard Parish, including the two oil refineries, had disaster mitigations plans that were filed with the local government. However, the local government lost most of its files in the flood that followed the levee failure. Employees of oil refineries in the disaster area have stated on online forums that their refineries filled tanks with water in order to prevent them from floating away. However, typical pre-Katrina industry standards on the Gulf Coast were based on a heavy rain event, and did not anticipate a full inundation of water around the storage tanks. Another refinery employee commented that these large oil storage tanks are sometimes purposely floated in order to move them. The containment levees around the tank are generally filled with water and tanks are moved in this way around tank farms. This is done on a planned basis with all oil removed from the tank being moved.

It chronicles the lives of a group of friends ‚Äî five young women ‚Äî a year after they graduate from high school, showing the heartbreaking changes and inspiring difficulties they face in both their friendships and the working world in the context of globalization. Plot In the bleak industrial landscape of historical port city of Incheon, five young women struggle to transition from high school to the adult world. Hae-joo pursues a career at a brokerage firm in Seoul, Tae-hee works without pay at her family's sauna and volunteers as a typist for a poet with cerebral palsy, Ji-young struggles to find work while living in a dilapidated house with her elderly grandparents and a kitten named Teetee, and twin sisters Bi-ryu and Ohn-jo live on their own and sell handmade jewellery on the street. Hae-joo tries to make herself invaluable at work but finds that she is at the bottom of the workplace hierarchy, relegated to running errands like sending faxes and bringing coffee. She is preoccupied with impressing her bosses at work and improving her physical appearance. In contrast, Ji-young has more immediate concerns‚Äîfinding work to support herself and her grandparents and getting the landlord to fix the roof that is on the verge of collapsing. Unable to find meaningful employment, Ji-young grows increasingly frustrated with her poverty-stricken life with her elderly grandparents. Without parents to vouch for her, and without computer skills or driver's license, she drifts from one low-wage job to another. Tae-hee, who is constantly belittled and ostracized by her comfortably middle-class but oppressively heteropatriarchal family, dreams of escaping the conformity but does not know where she could go. She finds herself drawn to ferry terminals and foreign migrant workers. Bi-ryu and Ohn-jo, whose Chinese-speaking grandparents have disowned their mother and refuse to see them for reasons not discussed in the film, live on their own in an ethnic Chinese enclave in Incheon. Hae-joo and Ji-young, who used to be best friends in high school, drift apart throughout the film in part due to their divergent socioeconomic status. After a sleepover at the twins' house one night, Ji-young returns home early in the morning to find that the roof of her house has collapsed, killing her grandparents. Refusing to cooperate with the police investigation and without any family support, Ji-young is locked up in juvenile detention though she has committed no crime. Tae-hee, who has grown closer to Ji-young, tracks her down and visits Ji-young in a youth detention facility. Ji-young reveals to Tae-hee that she has nowhere else to go even if she were released. When Ji-young is released from the detention center, she finds Tae-hee waiting for her with a suitcase packed for a trip. Tae-hee reveals that she has run away from home, having taken the money she was owed from working for her family without pay for a year. She suggests that they travel together, perhaps on Working Holiday, as they had discussed earlier in the film. The film ends with Tae-hee and Ji-young at the Incheon International Airport, about to depart for an unknown destination.  Symbolism  The cat Tee-tee is an important symbol of the ties between friends. Ji-young first brings the stray kitten into her home and later gives her as a birthday gift to Hae-joo. Hae-joo returns Teetee to Ji-young after just one night, saying that she has no time to raise a misbehaving cat in what appears to be a reflection of their deteriorating friendship. After Ji-young loses her home, she asks Tae-hee to take care of Teetee. Later, Tae-hee leaves Teetee in the care of Bi-ryu and Ohn-jo. The friends stay in touch through the use of mobile phone, with text messages and ringtones appearing frequently throughout the film as ubiquitous threads that connect their lives to each other. Cast *Bae Doona as Yoo Tae-hee *Lee Yo-won as Shin Hae-joo *Ok Ji- young as Seo Ji-young *Lee Eun-shil as Bi-ryu *Lee Eun-jo as Ohn-jo Reception Though the film was not successful in the box office, it was critically acclaimed and generated a large fan base including a \\"Save the Cat\\" movement involving film industry professionals and Incheon residents who tried to extend its theatrical run. A campaign was also launched for a theater re- run in 2001. Kevin Thomas for The Los Angeles Times praised the film for \\"depicting women's concerns without being the least bit preachy.\\" Local filmmakers organized a festival to support the survival of films that hold fast to artistic significance and compromise commercial success (in the process come and go without much recognition). The title of the event, WaRaNaGo, came from the initial syllables of four 2001 movies Ôºç Waikiki Brothers, Raybang, Nabi (\\"Butterfly\\") and Goyangireul Butakhae (\\"Take Care of My Cat\\") Ôºç which all fared poorly in the box office. The film won numerous awards at international film festivals, namely the NETPAC Award and New Currents Award Special Mention at the Pusan International Film Festival, the FIPRESCI Prize at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, the Best Picture award (\\"Golden Moon of Valencia\\") at the Cinema Jove Valencia International Film Festival, a KNF Award Special Mention in the competition section of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, among others. It was invited to the Young Forum section at the Berlin International Film Festival and was also theatrically released in Japan, Hong Kong, U.K and U.S.A. In 2020, the film was ranked by The Guardian number 19 among the classics of modern South Korean cinema. Awards ;2001 Busan International Film Festival\\"Take Care of My Cat - Awards\\". Cinemasie.

The NBR is one of the oldest National Wildlife Refuges in the United States. The size of the bison herd at the NBR is relatively small, numbering between 350 and 500 individuals. The initial herd of American bison was provided by organizations such as the American Bison Society, and today the refuge serves as the central point for bison research in the United States. The NBR consists of approximately and is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Other nearby National Wildlife Refuges are managed as parts of the National Bison Range Complex and include the Lost Trail, Ninepipe, Pablo and the Swan River National Wildlife Refuges. Also affiliated is the Northwest Montana Wetland Management District. The NBR has a visitor center, and two scenic roads that allow vehicular access to prime viewing areas. The refuge is approximately one hour north of Missoula, Montana with signs off of U.S. Highway 93 directing visitors to the entrance at Moiese, Montana, and the refuge headquarters.  History  Big Medicine on display at the Montana Historical Society museum The National Bison Range was established in 1908. The Civilian Conservation Corps built many of its buildings. Ernie Kraft, who began work at the Bison Range in 1955, published a history of the Bison Range and its people in 2006. A well-known white buffalo, \\"Whitey\\" (1933-1959, also called \\"Big Medicine\\"), spent his life at the Bison Range. Geology The Mission Mountains viewed from the Range The Refuge is a small, low-rolling mountain connected to the Mission Mountain Range by a gradually descending spur. Range elevation varies from at headquarters to at High Point on Red Sleep Mountain, the highest point on the Range. Much of the National Bison Range was once under prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula, which was formed by a glacial ice dam on the Clark Fork River about 13,000 to 18,000 years ago. The lake attained a maximum elevation of , so the upper part of the Refuge was above water. Old beach lines are still evident on north-facing slopes. Topsoil on the Range is generally shallow and mostly underlain with rock which is exposed in many areas, forming ledges and talus slopes. Soils over the major portion of the Range were developed from materials weathered from strongly folded pre-Cambrian quartzite and argillite bedrock.About the Refuge, March 12, 2013, viewed November 6, 2013, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, http://www.fws.gov/refuge/National_Bison_Range/about.html  Ecology  A bison roaming at the National Bison Range Bison herd grazing at the National Bison Range Elk (Cervus canadensis) in a creek Prior to the 1800s, bison were believed to number in the tens of millions, they once were found in all the current U.S. states, except Hawaii, and also throughout Canada. Bison were nearly extinct by 1890, having been part of a Federal government sponsored program of eradication during the Indian Wars, thereby removing a vital food source from the Plains Indians diet, and ensuring easier relocation onto Indian reservations. Bison were also considered to be a less desirable food source than domesticated cattle because of their wild nature. They were also viewed as competition for prime grazing lands that could be used by cattle. By the beginning of the 20th century efforts were being made to preserve the remaining bison and protect areas in which they could reconstitute. Approximately 250,000 bison can be found on federal and state lands, and in privately owned herds. In addition to the 350 to 500 bison on the National Bison Range, many other mammal species may be seen on the refuge, including coyote, black bear, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, mountain cottontail, Columbian ground squirrel, muskrat, yellow- pine chipmunk, badger, and cougar.Mammals - National Bison Range - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6 Feb. 2013.

Oaxaca is one of few Mexican states which is characterized by the continuance of its ancestral crafts, which are still used in everyday life. Barro negro is one of several pottery traditions in the state, which also include the glazed green pieces of Santa Mar√≠a Atzompa; however, barro negro is one of the best known and most identified with the state. It is also one of the most popular and appreciated styles of pottery in Mexico. The origins of this pottery style extends as far back as the Monte Alban period and for almost all of this pottery's history, had been available only in a grayish matte finish. In the 1950s, a potter named Do√±a Rosa devised a way to put a black metallic like sheen onto the pottery by polishing it before firing. This look has made the pottery far more popular. From the 1980s to the present, an artisan named Carlomagno Pedro Mart√≠nez has promoted items made this way with barro negro sculptures which have been exhibited in a number of countries. History Sculpture of a funeral in barro negro at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City. The origins of barro negro pottery extend over centuries, with examples of it found at archeological sites, fashioned mostly into jars and other utilitarian items. It has remained a traditional crafts of the Zapotecs and Mixtecs of the Central Valleys area to the present day. Originally barro negro pottery was matte and grayish. In this form, the pottery is very sturdy, allowing it to be hit without breaking. In the 1950s, Do√±a Rosa Real discovered that she could change the color and shine of the pieces by polishing the clay pieces and firing them at a slightly lower temperature. Just before the formed clay piece is completely dry, it is polished with a quartz stone to compress the surface. After firing, the piece emerges a shiny black instead of a dull gray. This innovation makes the pieces more breakable, but it has made the pottery far more popular with Mexican folk art collectors, including Nelson Rockefeller, who promoted it in the United States. The popularity stems from the look, rather than wearability, so many pieces are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utility. Do√±a Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the pottery is being carried on by her daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists in their local potters' workshop.Pg 744 ‚Äì - Total pages: 1056 The workshop is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner courtyard. Despite being the origin of black polished clay, pieces at this workshop are much cheaper than in other parts of Mexico. Another important person in the development and promotion of barro negro is Carlomagno Pedro Martinez. He was born in San Bartolo Coyotepec into a pottery-making family. He was named after Charlemagne by his grandmother, who was an admirer of the king. From a young age, he showed talent in fashioning figures in clay. When he was grown, he attended the Fine Arts Workshop of Rufino Tamayo in Oaxaca city. He has become the first potter/sculptor in the medium, winning his first recognition in 1985 for his work. His fame increased with his development of human skulls made of barro negro in the years that followed. Each piece Carlomagno makes is unique, but themes such as oral histories, indigenous legends, Christianity and death, called \\"our grandmother,\\" recur. In Mexico, he has exhibited his work in dozens of expositions and has won three national-level awards. His work has been featured in five books. Martinez‚Äôs work has been exhibited in the United States, Colombia, Argentina, Lebanon, Germany, Spain, and Japan, with one of his latest exhibits in New York in 2008. In that same year, he created a mural in barro negro at the Baseball Academy in San Bartolo Coyotepec sponsored by the Alfredo Harp Hel√∫ Foundation. San Bartolo Coyotepec A woman cutting designs into unfired barro negro pottery in San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca, Mexico. The craft is made in San Bartolo Coyotepec and a large number of small communities in the surrounding valley, where the clay that gives it its color is found. This community is located south of the city of Oaxaca, with about 600 families in the area dedicated to the craft. In addition to a number of family workshops, including Do√±a Rosa's, the Mercado de Artesanias in an important attraction which brings visitors from many parts of Mexico and other countries. A group of fourteen people exhibit and sell barro negro objects. Some of these products include vases, animal figures and jars. Demonstrations of pottery making are held as well. In 2005, the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca(State Museum of Popular Art) was opened here. It has one of its three halls dedicated to barro negro, with pieces from the Monte Alban era to the present day. In 2009, San Bartolo Coyotepec held its first Feria Artesanal de Barro Negro (Crafts Fair of Barro Negro) with the participation of over 150 artisans. Objects made with barro negro Many different kinds of objects are made of barro negro including pots, whistles, flutes, bells, masks, lamps, animal figures with most being of a decorative nature and not for the storage of food and water. One exception to this is the use of cantaros from San Bartolo Coyotepec to age and store mezcal at many distilleries. These large jars are not polished and retain the ancient gray matte, which allows them to be resistant to liquid. Another quality the gray matte version has is that it can be struck similar to a bell, and the cantaros are also used as musical instruments. The sound produced is crystalline. Another famous barro negro object is the \\"mezcal monkey\\" (chango mezcalero). This is a vessel created for the alcoholic liquor mezcal in the shape of a monkey. It is made to hold between 700 ml and 1 liter of the liquid with a cork or corncob stopper. It is either painted in bright colors or left grayish with detailed etchings. Valente Nieto, the sole surviving progeny of Do√±a Rosa states that his family created the mezcal monkey and no one else. He claims that his father was a gifted sculptor, and mezcal owners came to their property requesting novelty bottles for the alcoholic beverage. The monkey as well as other animal shapes were created. However, another family, that of Marcelo Simon Galan, also claim to have created the container. His surviving granddaughter says that he made the shape at the request of a customer. An example of Galan‚Äôs work is on display at the Museo de Arte Popular de Oaxaca in San Bartolo Coyotepec. Underground pits in which cured barro negro pottery is fired. Process Creation of a pitcher at the Do√±a Rosa workshop The color of barro negro is due to the properties of the clay, and is not colored. The earth used to extract the clay is cleaned to remove impurities, which can take a month of soaking and settling out the clay from the rest of the soil. After this process, each piece takes about twenty days to complete. Traditionally, the clay is molded on plates balanced on rocks to that they can be spun by hand. Modern potters‚Äô tools are not used. Large pieces, such as cantaros are fashioned from the bottom up adding clay as the piece grows. After it is shaped, the pieces are set to dry in a well-insulated room to protect them from sudden changes in temperature. Drying can take up to three weeks. If the piece is to be polished so that it turns out shiny black when finished, it is polished when the piece is almost dry. The surface of the piece is lightly moistened and then rubbed with a curved quartz stone. This compacts the surface of the clay and creates the metallic sheen and dark color during firing. This is also the stage when decorative accents such as clay flowers or small handles are added. The designs of barro negro objects are unique to this area. The pieces are then fired in underground pits or above ground kilns, using wood fires that heat the objects to between 700 and 800 ¬∞C. When they emerge, the polished pieces are a shiny black and the unpolished ones have a grey matte finish.

George VIII (Georgian: ·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò VIII, Giorgi VIII; 1417‚Äì1476) was the last king of the united Georgia, though his kingdom was already splintered and embroiled in a civil war, from 1446 to 1465. Defeated by his rivals, he was left with an eastern province Kakheti alone, where he reigned as George I from 1465 until his death, founding a local branch of the Bagrationi royal house. Life He was the third son of Alexander I of Georgia by his second wife Tamar. Though Demetre, Alexander‚Äôs second son, seems to have been a rightful successor to his elder brother Vakhtang IV, George actually held power after Vakhtang‚Äôs death in December 1446. The process of the disintegration of the Georgian kingdom had already begun and was close to reach its climax. The most troublesome were revolts by the western Georgian nobles and the atabegs of Samtskhe. The latter even attempted to create a separate church for his princedom, but the efforts of the Georgian Catholicos Patriarch David IV prevented the Georgian Orthodox Church from being split into two. George‚Äôs reign coincided with a major turning point in Near East history: in 1453 the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople and put an end to the Byzantine Empire, with the emperor Constantine XI, to whom George‚Äôs daughter was betrothed, dying in battle. The Georgian politicians, preoccupied in their own power struggle, seem to have underestimated the event which would leave Georgia isolated from Christian Europe for almost the three subsequent centuries. Yet, Georgia was considered as a possible participant of a large anti-Ottoman crusade planned by the Pope Pius II and Western European powers. For this purpose, Ludovicus Bologninus was sent to hold talks in Georgia and George VIII agreed a truce with his internal opponents. Georgians hoped to mobilise in total 120,000 soldiers to fight sultan Mehmed the Conqueror and proposed even to continue the Crusade on Jerusalem. The coalition was never formed, however, and the fratricidal struggles within Georgia were soon resumed. In 1462, George took Samokalako (Kutaisi and the surrounding area) from its owner, a royal kinsman, Bagrat for his support to the rebel prince Qvarqvare II Jakeli, a powerful atabeg of Samtskhe. In 1463, Bagrat allied himself with other oppositionist royal subjects, dukes (eristavi) of Mingrelia, Guria, Svaneti and Abkhazia. The rebels met and defeated the king at the Battle of Chikhori. Subsequently, the king lost all western provinces and Bagrat was crowned king of Imereti. In 1465, George attempted to subdue Qvarqvare II of Samtskhe, only to be attacked and taken prisoner at Lake Paravani. The situation was immediately exploited by Bagrat of Imereti, who seized control of Tbilisi and declared himself king of Georgia. Atabeg Qvarqvare, who now considered Bagrat as his major rival, freed George. The latter, unsuccessful in his attempt to recover his crown, was only able to establish himself as a separate king in the easternmost province of Kakheti. There, he substantially reorganised the administration, subdividing the kingdom into much smaller and easily controllable samouravo (counties) instead of autonomous saeristavo (duchies). Unlike to other Georgian polities, he put ecclesiastic lords (bishops of Bodbe, Alaverdi, Rustavi, and Nekresi), generally more loyal to the crown than secular nobles, in charge of special military districts, sadrosho. He died in 1476 to be succeeded by Alexander I as king of Kakheti. Marriage and children George VIII's royal charters make mention of two names of his consort, Tamar (fl. 1453) and Nestan-Darejan (fl. 1458‚Äì1463). Two explanations exist to account for this. One of them, suggested by Cyril Toumanoff, has it that both names were borne by the same woman, a daughter of Bagrat, son of Constantine I of Georgia, and, thus a first cousin of George VIII, whom she married in 1445. Such polyonymy was not infrequent in Georgia, Toumanoff explains, reflecting the twofold cultural background of the country, \\"Hellenistic-Christian on the one hand, and Caucasio-Iranoid, on the other.\\" She is last mentioned in 1510. An alternative view, enjoying a more general currency in Georgia, holds it that George VIII was married twice, first to Tamar, sometimes thought to have been daughter of Kvarkvare II Jaqeli, Atabag of Samtskhe, whom he wed c. 1445 and, secondly to Nestan-Darejan, of unknown origin, whom the king took as his wife sometime before 1456. According to this version, Alexander had a son, Vakhtang, and two daughters; and a son, Aleksandre, and a daughter, Mariam, by Nestan-Darejan. Nestan-Darejan was known as the \\"builder of churches\\" for his patronage of religious construction, notably, the Alaverdi Monastery. George VIII's children were: * Prince Vakhtang (c. 1445 ‚Äì before 1510), a \\"provincial king\\", he was married to the certain Gulkan; * Princess Elene, married to Spiridon Beenashvili, a nobleman from Meskheti; * Princess Keteon (Kristine), married to Vakhushti Shalikahsvili, a nobleman from Samtskhe; * Prince Aleksandre (1445 or c. 1456 ‚Äì 1511), King of Kakheti (1476‚Äì1511); * Princess Mariam (fl. 1465), married to Prince Giorgi Shaburidze, son of Vamek, Duke of Argavi. She is identified by C. Toumanoff with the anonymous daughter of George VIII betrothed in 1451 to Constantine XI, the last Byzantine emperor, who was killed in the fall of Constantinople two years later, before the marriage could be consummated.

It follows a barber, his wife, and their only son through four decades of tumultuous Korean history. Much as in Forrest Gump, we see important moments in South Korean history through the eyes of the titular barber, who is drafted to be the official barber of President Park Chung-hee. The role of the barber is played by Song Kang-ho and Moon So-ri plays his wife. Story Seong Han-mo (Song Kang-ho) is a barber and owns a shop in the president's neighborhood, the Blue House. Politically not very well-versed he always joins his acquaintances' opinions and at first also isn't aware what consequences result from president Rhee's resignation in 1960 after several student demonstrations. Rhee leaves a power vacuum that is soon filled by a military regime led by General Park Chung-hee (Jo Yeong-jin) who puts himself at the top of the government in 1963. Han-mo, however, has different concerns as his wife Min-ja (Moon So-ri) brings a son into this world of politically turbulent times. Fortunately, Han-mo's barber shop is running well and he has no need to concern himself about how to feed his family anymore when KCIA-Chef Jang (Son Byong-ho) enters his shop and orders him to the president. From that day on simple-minded Han-mo is the president's barber and at least for his neighbors one of the most important people in the country.

The first and most numerous were from the D√ºbs and Company, the next from the Wellington firm E.W. Mills Lion Foundry, and the last from the Scottish firm of Shanks. The specifications are for the Dubs Yorkshire engines. Dubs The A class was the second class of steam locomotive (after 1872's F class) ordered to work on New Zealand's national railways. Initially ordered by the Public Works Department for use in the construction of lines in Canterbury and Taranaki, the A class was a small tank locomotive with a wheel arrangement of 0-4-0T. An initial twelve were constructed by D√ºbs and Company in 1873 and two more were built in 1875 by Yorkshire Engine Company. They were not just used by the Public Works Department; the New Zealand Government Railways also utilised the class to operate revenue services on smaller branch lines. Quickly outmoded for use on the lines they helped build, only one (A62) remained in government service by 1905, used on the Piha Tramway and later on NZR's Stores Branch Piha Tramway. By 1906 all Dubs A class locomotives were out of service for NZR. Their small size made them perfect for use on bush tramways and small private industrial sidings. Many members of the class survived for decades in private use, and although all are now retired from commercial service, four have survived to be preserved by railway enthusiasts and two of the four are currently in fully operational condition. One of these preserved locomotives, A 67, was the first in a cavalcade of locomotives at the celebration of the hundredth birthday of the Dunedin Railway Station. Mills A batch of A class engines, with differing external details, was built at Wellington by E.W. Mills' Lion Foundry in 1873, for use on the Foxton Section.The first of the three . . . The Evening Post page 2, 22 June 1875 These appear to be the first NZR locomotives actually built in the country. Like other so-called contractors engines, they were quickly outmoded for line haulage and were sold to industrial operators. \\"Opossum\\" was sold in 1877 and served industrial and timber companies for eight decades. The other two were likewise sold by 1885. Shanks A further batch was built by Alexander Shanks and Company, of Arbroath, Scotland in 1876 on behalf of the Otago Provincial Council for construction work on the Riverton and Otautau lines in Southland. Both were sold by 1882 and one, Mouse spent the next four decades in the local timber industry. The other went to similar work in Westland. Didos The term \\"Dido\\", as applying to New Zealand shunting locomotives, can be traced back to the small A class. Crew members from the ship , moored at Bluff Harbour, in May, 1875 were looking for a night on the town, while in port. They took a small 4-wheeled rail trolley and taking turns, both rode and pushed the trolley into Invercargill. When the southern enginemen saw the first A class locomotive arrive for use as a shunter, the name \\"Dido\\" was given as a nickname because of its diminutive size. This size led British Journalist Charles Rous-Marten to describe them as \\"a most absurd dwarf\\".

She released over a dozen music albums with songs in Polish, as well as several albums with Russian repertoire. Throughout her music career, she recorded songs in seven languages: Polish, Russian, German, Italian, Spanish, English and Latin. Biography Anna German was a Polish and Russian-language singer. She was born in Urgench, a city with a population of 22,000 in northwestern Uzbekistan in Central Asia, then Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. Her mother, Irma Martens, was the descendant of Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites invited to Russia by Catherine II. Her accountant father, Eugen (Eugeniusz) H√∂rmann (in Russian, –ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω), was also of a Russian-German pastor family and born during travel in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (Czarist Russian Empire) now Poland. Eugen H√∂rmann's father, Anna's grandfather, Friedrich H√∂rmann, who had studied theology at ≈Å√≥d≈∫, was in 1929 incarcerated in Gulag Plesetsk by Communists for being a priest, where he died. In 1937, during the NKVD's anti-German operation, Eugen H√∂rmann was arrested in Urgench on false charges of spying, and executed (officially, sentenced to ten years in prison). Thereafter, Anna and her mother and grandmother survived in the Kemerovo Region of Siberia, as well as in Tashkent, and later in the Kyrgyz and Kazakh SSRs. Anna German plaque in Wroc≈Çaw In 1946, her mother (who had married Herman Gerner, a Ludowe Wojsko Polskie soldier) was able to take the family to Silesia, first Nowa Ruda and then Wroc≈Çaw in 1949. Anna quickly learned Polish and several other languages and grew up hiding her family heritage. She graduated from the Geological Institute of Wroclaw University. During her university years, she began her music career at the Kalambur theater. Anna finally became successful when she won the 1964 II Festival of Polish Songs in Opole with her song \\"Ta≈ÑczƒÖce Eurydyki\\". One year later, she won first prize in the international song contest in Sopot. Anna performed in the March√© international de l'√©dition musicale in Cannes, as well as on the stages of Belgium, Germany, United States, Canada and Australia. She also sang in Russian, English, Italian, Spanish, Latin, German and Mongolian.Anna German in Mongolia In 2001, six of her Polish albums were reissued on CDs. In recent years, many compilation albums of her songs have also been released in both Russia and Poland.  Career in Italy  In December 1966, German in Milan signed a contract with a small firm CDI to release the records, thus becoming the first performer from behind the \\"iron curtain\\", which was recorded in Italy. In Italy, Anna German has performed at the festival in San Remo, starred in a television show, a recorded programme with the singer Domenico Modugno, performed at the festival of Neapolitan songs in Sorrento and received the award \\"Oscar della simpatia\\".  Car accident and treatment  On 27 August 1967, while in Italy, on the road between Forl√¨ and Milan, Anna German was involved in a severe car accident. At high speed, the car driven by the impresario of the singer crashed into a concrete fence. Anna was thrown from the car through the windshield. She suffered multiple fractures, internal injuries. The results of the investigation revealed that the driver of the car ‚Äì her manager Renato Serio ‚Äì fell asleep at the wheel. He escaped with a fracture of the hand and feet. After the accident, German had not regained consciousness. After the plaster was taken off, the singer still lay in a hospital bed for half a year. Then it took her a few months to relearn to sit and walk. Later in the 1960s, she released the autobiographical book \\"Come Back to Sorrento?\\"(\\"Wr√≥ƒá do Sorrento?\\"), dedicated to the Italian period of her career. The book's circulation was 30,000 copies.  Personal life  On 23 March 1972, she married Zbigniew Tucholski. Their son, Zbigniew, was born on 27 November 1975. In the last years of her life, she composed some church songs. Before she died of osteosarcoma at 46 in 1982, she joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. German was buried at Warsaw Evangelical cemetery. Anna loved to cook Oriental dishes. Her favorite foods were boiled potatoes with herring, pickles, pies with cabbage, black tea with lemon, and oatmeal cookies. She did not consume alcohol.

Cyberdreams in 1995, and is the sequel to the 1992 game Dark Seed. It sees recurring protagonist Mike Dawson's continued adventures in the H.R. Giger artwork-based \\"Dark World.\\" Designed and written by future James Bond novelist Raymond Benson, the game was released for Microsoft Windows 3.x, Macintosh, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation. As was the case with Dark Seed, console versions of Dark Seed II were released only in Japan, though they were additionally fully dubbed in Japanese. Unlike the original game, the Saturn version of Dark Seed II does not support the shuttle mouse. Development David Mullich was the producer and oversaw development of the game, while Raymond Benson wrote its script, dialog, and puzzles, whose writing drew influence from that of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Incidentally, H. R. Giger did not produce any original artwork for Dark Seed II; artwork that he had previously created was licensed for use in the game. While the character of Mike Dawson was played in the first Dark Seed by actual game developer Mike Dawson, the character in Dark Seed II is instead portrayed by an actor named Chris Gilbert. Storyline Although Mike Dawson saved the world from the \\"Ancients\\" in Dark Seed, the experience causes him to undergo a mental breakdown. He returns to his childhood hometown of Crowley, Texas in an attempt to regain his sanity, and moves in with his mother. A year goes by, and Mike is still suffering from serious mental scarring and memory lapses. Worse, Rita, his girlfriend, is found murdered after their high school reunion, and the entire town of Crowley seems convinced that Mike is the culprit, with the exception of his friend Jack. It is evident the \\"Ancients\\" have returned, and the only way for Mike to clear his name is by venturing between alternate realities and solving their mysteries, while simultaneously stopping the Ancients from taking over the world. If Mike dies at any point in the game, he is sent to the Underworld and meets the Keeper of the Souls, who states that Mike is destined to die. If Mike loses another life, he will return to the Underworld and plunge into a River of Blood, while the Keeper of the Scrolls informs the player that the Ancients have consequently created a monster called the \\"Behemoth,\\" and that it has sucked the \\"life force\\" from earth. This will also happen near the game's finale if Mike fails to clear the Dark World mirror maze ahead of the Behemoth, allowing it to cross over into the \\"Light World\\" where it becomes immortal. Mike enters the Dark World counterpart of his home, identical to it in the Light World, and after a seemingly normal greeting from his \\"mother,\\" her head violently explodes. Mike then sees Rita's head shrouded in the vapors of his mom's cooking, who explains about the Behemoth and that the \\"Sword\\" is powerful enough to kill it. Mike obtains the Sword from the Keeper of the Sword, and the Keeper of the Scrolls advises him to take a shortcut through the Dark World mirror maze. If he succeeds, he will successfully kill the monster with his Sword. Afterward, Mike blows up the Ancients' spaceship, and the Keeper of the Scrolls congratulates him. He wakes up in his psychiatrist's office and finds Jack next to the deceased doctor's body. Mike comes to the realization that Jack is his Dark World counterpart and gets stabbed by him, dying. Sheriff Butler and his deputy enter the scene and, apparently oblivious to Jack's presence, arrive at the conclusion of Mike having committed suicide and indeed being responsible for all the murders that occurred through course of the game. Jack is then seen exiting via the Dark World, leaving it ambiguous as to whether the events of the game really happened or were part of Mike's delusions.

Family background Liu Yuan was a member of Xiongnu nobility, as a descendant of Luandi Modu, who, along with their people, had long been loyal vassals of Han Dynasty, and then to its successor states Cao Wei and Jin Dynasty (265-420). In late Cao Wei or early Jin times, the Xiongnu nobles claimed that they had Han Dynasty ancestry as well‚Äîthrough a princess that married the first great chanyu in Xiongnu history, Modu Shanyu, and therefore changed their family name to Liu, the same name as the Han imperial clan. Liu Yuan's father Liu Bao was a son of one of the last chanyus, Yufuluo, and the nephew of the very last chanyu Huchuquan (before Cao Cao abolished the office in 216 and divided the Xiongnu into five tribes (bu, ÈÉ®)), and he had the command of the Left Tribe (Â∑¶ÈÉ®). Liu Yuan's mother Lady Huyan (ÂëºÂª∂) appeared to be from a noble family, and was in probability Liu Bao's wife and not a concubine, but that is not clear, though other sources state this was a name for Cai Wenji. As all five tribes settled down in modern southern Shanxi, that was likely where Liu Yuan was born and raised. As Jin subject As powerful Xiongnu nobles were usually encouraged or pressured by Cao Wei and Jin authorities to send their sons to the capital Luoyang (both to encourage them to further sinicization and as collateral for their loyalty), Liu Yuan was sent to Luoyang to reside and to study traditional Chinese literature. He became well known for his studies, particularly of the Zou version of Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals and of the military strategies of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi. The key Jin official Wang Hun (ÁéãÊ∏æ) (one of the lead generals who later participated in conquering Eastern Wu) became impressed with him, and Wang Hun's son Wang Ji (ÁéãÊøü) became a close friend of Liu Yuan's. Wang Hun believed Liu to be general material and repeatedly recommended Liu Yuan to Emperor Wu, but Kong Xun (Â≠îÊÅÇ) and Empress Yang Zhi's uncle Yang Ji (Ê•äÊøü) suspected Liu for his Xiongnu ancestry and persuaded Emperor Wu against giving Liu military commands during campaigns against Eastern Wu and the Xianbei rebel Tufa Shujineng. Eventually, even Emperor Wu's brother Sima You the Prince of Qi, impressed and fearful of Liu's abilities, encouraged Emperor Wu to have Liu executed, but Wang Hun persuaded Emperor Wu that it would be wrong. When Liu Bao died, Emperor Wu permitted Liu Yuan to take over command of the Left Tribe. As the commander of the Left Tribe, Liu became known for his fair administration of laws and willingness to listen to ideas, and also for his willingness to spread his wealth. Therefore, the ambitious people in his region, not only of the five Xiongnu tribes but of many Han clans, flocked to him. After Emperor Wu's death and succession by Emperor Hui, the regent Yang Jun made Liu the commander of all five tribes, but toward the end of the subsequent regency of Emperor Hui's wife Empress Jia Nanfeng, Liu was removed from that position due to his inability to stop one of his countrymen's rebellions. Later, when Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu became the military commander at Yecheng, he invited Liu to be one of his subordinate military commanders, and Liu accepted the invitation. Independence from Jin In the midst of the War of the Eight Princes, in 304, Xiongnu nobles, led by the commander of the North Tribe, Liu Xuan (ÂäâÂÆ£), tired of the Jin misrule and secretly plotted reindependence from Jin. They sent a messenger to secretly offer Liu Yuan the title of Grand Chanyu. Liu Yuan then told Sima Ying, who was then concerned about an attack from Wang Jun (ÁéãÊµö), whose troops were reinforced with Xianbei and Wuhuan soldiers, that he would be willing to mobilize Xiongnu soldiers to support Sima Ying's cause. Sima Ying agreed and allowed Liu Yuan to return to the Xiongnu tribes. Once Liu Yuan returned to his people, he gathered 50,000 men quickly and was readying himself to rush to Sima Ying's aid, but he also publicly accepted the title of Grand Chanyu. (Previously, Sima Ying had bestowed the title of North Chanyu on him.) However, he then heard that Sima Ying's forces had collapsed in fear of Wang's troops and that Sima Ying had, against his prior advice, fled to Luoyang. He then declared his people independent from Jin and further declared that, as a Han descendant, he would succeed to the Han throne, and therefore claimed the title of the King of Han‚Äîdeliberately choosing a title that had been previously held by Han Dynasty's founder, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao). He reestablished the worship of eight Han emperors‚ÄîEmperor Gao, Emperor Wen, Emperor Wu, Emperor Xuan, Emperor Guangwu, Emperor Ming, Emperor Zhang, and Liu Bei (Emperor Zhaolie). He created his wife Lady Huyan (likely a relative of his mother) princess. (The name of Liu's state was therefore \\"Han,\\" but is often referred to as \\"Han Zhao\\" or \\"Former Zhao\\" because his nephew Liu Yao, who took the throne in 318, changed the name of the state to Zhao in 319.) Reign For those impressed with Liu's abilities previously, however, his reign was somewhat of a let down. He spent great energy on trying to restore the Han system of government, but he himself was unable to quickly expand his sphere of influence. He set his capital at Lishi (Èõ¢Áü≥, in modern L√ºliang, Shanxi), but his control of territory became limited to that local region. His forces were often able to achieve victories over Jin forces but unable to hold cities. In 305, after a famine, he relocated to Liting (Èªé‰∫≠, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). As years went by, however, the various agrarian rebel generals who were resisting Jin rule, whether ethnically Wu Hu or Han, often chose to come under Liu Yuan's Han banner. Chief among these were the Chinese general Wang Mi (ÁéãÂΩå) and the Jie general Shi Le (both of whom declared loyalty to Han Zhao in 307), who generally only nominally submitted to Liu's orders while maintaining separate power structures but who also did appear to genuinely respect and fear Liu. As for troops under his own control, Liu largely entrusted them to his son Liu Cong the Prince of Chu and his nephew Liu Yao the Prince of Shi'an. The four generals, while not being able to hold cities, were generally able to rove throughout northern and central China unimpeded by Jin forces, defeating most Jin generals who opposed them. In 308, Wang's troops advanced on the Jin capital Luoyang, but was repelled. That year, after capturing more territory, Liu Yuan moved his capital to Puzi (Ëí≤Â≠ê, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) and declared himself emperor, signifying an even more complete break from Jin. In 309, he moved the capital once more to Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, also in modern Linfen). By this time, Liu Cong and Wang Mi had eventually been able to control all of southern Shanxi for Han Zhao, and they again attacked Luoyang, but were again repelled. In 310, Liu Yuan grew ill, and he created his second wife Lady Dan empress and his oldest son Liu He (by his first wife Empress Huyan‚Äîwho appeared to have died by this point, although her death was not mentioned in history) crown prince. When he died later that year, Liu He became emperor. However, only a week later, he was overthrown and killed by Liu Cong, who then became emperor.

Both Gonzalez and Richards are associated with the Discovery Institute, identified with the intelligent design movement; Gonzalez works as a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. Reception This book has proven to be highly controversial within the scientific community. Positive reviews: Owen Gingerich, astronomer and historian of science, reviews the book explaining \\"This thoughtful, delightfully contrarian book will rile up those who believe the 'Copernican principle' is an essential philosophical component of modern science. Is our universe designedly congenial to intelligent, observing life? Passionate advocates of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) will find much to ponder in this carefully documented analysis.\\" Philip Skell, physicist, reviewed the book writing \\"In this fascinating and highly original book, Guillermo Gonzalez and Jay Richards advance a persuasive argument, and marshal a wealth of diverse scientific evidence to justify that argument. In the process, they effectively challenge several popular assumptions, not only about the nature and history of science, but also about the nature and origin of the cosmos. The Privileged Planet will be impossible to ignore. It is likely to change the way we view both the scientific enterprise and the world around us. I recommend it highly.\\" Negative reviews: William H. Jefferys, an astronomer, reviewed the book writing \\"the little that is new in this book isn't interesting, and what is old is just old-hat creationism in a new, modern-looking astronomical costume.\\" Victor J. Stenger, a physicist and philosopher, reviewed the book explaining that it not only \\"ignores\\" the 2000 book Rare Earth (written by Gonzalez's Washington colleagues paleontologist Peter Ward and astronomer Donald E. Brownlee), but it goes against \\"the consensus of astrobiologists in adopting the Rare Earth position.\\" Film The book served as the basis for a movie by the same name. The Institute donated $16,000 to the Smithsonian Institution, which according to policy, must allow a special event on its premises. The Institute chose to show the film at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian withdrew its cosponsorship, stating: \\"We have determined that the content of the film is not consistent with the mission of the Smithsonian Institution's scientific research.\\" They allowed the film to be shown but turned down the payment. Charles G. Lambdin reviewed the film, concluding that while life on planets may be remote, there are a lot of planets and \\"Using Gonzalez and Richard‚Äôs own odds of habitability, this suggests that there may be one billion habitable planets due to chance alone.\\" He also argued that the film's claim that the fact that we can do science at all suggests the universe was designed so that we can understand it is no different than the old quip that the nose must have been designed so that we can wear spectacles. The film is listed on IMDB.com as being distributed and produced by Illustra Media and Randolph Productions. Tenure controversy The Institute has alleged that the book is \\"at the heart of the attacks on Iowa State University astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez\\" and played a role in his denial of tenure and that it provoked 124 of Gonzalez's faculty colleagues to sign a petition in 2005 denouncing intelligent design and urging all other faculty members to do the same.The Spiritual Brain, p. 25 The statement did not mention Guillermo Gonzalez or his involvement with the creationism movement, and faculty members, including Hector Avalos have denied that the statement was directed at Guillermo Gonzalez.

History In 1853 natural salt springs were found in the downtown area of St. Catharines, Ontario. A trio of men bought three lots at this corner and construction began on the Welland House Hotel. The hotel was constructed using mostly Black workers and was the second spa hotel to be built in the area. Opening in 1856, the mineral waters were pumped from the main spring near Twelve Mile Creek to the hotel. It was believed the waters had healing powers and could cure many ailments. Welland House was established as part of the local spa market, and was mainly a summer resort that catered to wealthy citizens in Canada and the United States. The hotel often boasted famous guests including actors, politicians, musicians and performers. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica even listed it as one of the world's best spas. The hotel had a number of owners, including the Malcomson brothers who purchased it in 1893. They greatly improved it by drilling a new well, building a bath house and opening a private hospital named The Wellandra. The hospital was a key addition to the hotel, and continued to promote the healing powers found in mineral water treatments. In November 1909, Mary Malcolmson started the first North American Girl Guide troop at the Welland House. Unfortunately, the spa business in St. Catharines went into decline and Welland House closed its doors in 1993. The Hotel Bar, named the Alibi Room was known to be a meeting place for gays and lesbians in the area from 1968 until its closing. Current use Today, the building is home to a student residence and CFBU radio The Welland House re-opened in 1994 as a restaurant (Average Joe's) and student residence. Although Average Joe's has since closed, the Welland House remains a student residence. Known as the \\"Downtown Student Residence\\", or DSR, many of the residents are students attending Brock University or Niagara College. The building has become the home of CFBU-FM, Brock University's campus radio station. In the Summer of 2007, major interior renovations were made in various rooms. Some rooms received new flooring, bathroom fixtures, ceiling lights, wet and dry kitchenettes, and new paint. Renovations continue on the DSR's main lobby and exterior facade.

On March 4, 1887, Benson platted the land on the Creighton farm and called it Benson Place, later changing it to Benson. The newly platted community was located along Military Avenue, approximately northwest of Omaha. In the mid-to-late 1910s, Omaha embarked on a course of annexations of suburban communities to its north and west. Residents of Benson, anticipating annexation of their own city, decided to build as many civic improvements as they could: they feared that Omaha would be inattentive to their desire for such improvements after annexation, and they knew that following annexation, the larger city would have to assume the debts incurred to build the improvements. To this end, they built a new combined city hall and fire station in late 1915.Moffett, Chad, Emily Schill, Erin Pogany, and Christina Slattery. \\"Reconnaissance Survey of Selected Neighborhoods in Omaha, Nebraska\\".

The species is endemic to Darjeeling, West Bengal Province, India. Etymology Indotyphlops meszoelyi was named after American paleontologist Charles A.M. Meszoely (born 1933) of the Center for Vertebrate Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. Description The holotype specimen of I. meszoelyi measures in total length (including tail), and has a diameter of in the middle of its body. It can be distinguished from other species in the same genus found in that region by the presence of a \\"deep concavity along the posterior border of the nasal shield\\". The snake is brown on its back and lighter brown on its belly, with the two colors merging into each other. Habitat and ecology The holotype specimen of I. meszoelyi was collected in a region of rugged hills, in the foothills of the Himalayas. It is thought to inhabit temperate broadleaf forests. The area in which the specimen was collected was historically montane forest, but today has been mostly turned into fruit orchards and paddy fields. I. meszoelyi is oviparous, or egg-laying. Geographic range and conservation status The holotype specimen of I. meszoelyi was collected in Darjeeling district of the Indian state of West Bengal, at an altitude of above sea level. No other information about its distribution is currently available. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified Typhlops meszoelyi as Data Deficient in 2010, based on the fact that the species was only known from the location in which the holotype specimen was collected. However, it stated that habitat loss and degradation were known to occur within the range of the species, although the impact of these on the snake was unknown. The area in which the specimen was found is used to graze livestock, which may constitute a threat to the species. ReferencesFurther reading * (Indotyphlops meszoelyi, new combination).

Composition Mozart completed the concerto in January 1777, nine months after his Piano Concerto No. 8 in C major and with few significant compositions in the intervening period. He composed the work for Victoire Jenamy, the daughter of Jean-Georges Noverre and a proficient pianist. Mozart performed the concerto at a private concert on 4 October 1777. Jenamy may have premiered the work earlier. Structure The work is scored for solo piano, 2 oboes, 2 horns (in E), and strings. It consists of three movements: I. Allegro The opening measures of the first movement. The lower stave is the orchestral part at the pitch played by the violins, oboes and horns; the violas, cellos and basses play an octave lower. The upper stave is the right hand of the piano part. The first movement opens, unusually for the time, with interventions by the soloist, anticipating Beethoven's Fourth and Fifth Concertos. As Cuthbert Girdlestone (1964) notes, its departures from convention do not end with this early solo entrance but continue in the style of dialogue between piano and orchestra in the rest of the movement. Mozart wrote two cadenzas for this movement. II. Andantino The second movement is written in the relative minor key. In only five of Mozart's piano concertos is the second movement in a minor key (K. 41, K. 271, K. 456, K. 482, and K. 488. K. 41 is an arrangement). Mozart wrote two cadenzas for this movement. III. Rondo (Presto) The third movement which opens with the solo piano is in a rondo form on a large scale. It is interrupted, surprisingly, by a slow minuet section in the subdominant key of A major (a procedure Mozart would repeat with his 22nd concerto, 1785, also in the key of E major). The work ends in the original tempo. Reception The work is highly regarded by critics. Charles Rosen has called it \\"perhaps the first unequivocal masterpiece [of the] classical style.\\" Alfred Brendel has called it \\"one of the greatest wonders of the world.\\"\\"A Break From Romanticism With Some Mozart\\" by Vivien Schweitzer, The New York Times, 20 April 2012 Alfred Einstein dubbed it \\"Mozart's Eroica.\\"\\"Mozart Piano Concerto No. 9 in E-flat Major, K. 271\\" by Ethan Allred, Chamber Music Northwest Cuthbert Girdlestone was not quite as effusive in his praise, however, noting that the slow movement, while a great leap forward for Mozart, was still somewhat limited and the work as a whole was not equal to the piano concertos from the composer's peak in Vienna from 1784 to 1787, nor equal to his best compositions overall. Name The work has long been known as the Jeunehomme Concerto. Th√©odore de Wyz√©wa and Georges de Saint-Foix claimed that Mozart wrote the piece for an unnamed French pianist 'Jeunehomme' (French for \\"young man\\") visiting Salzburg. This name for the dedicatee is incorrect; in 2004 Michael Lorenz demonstrated that the dedicatee was actually Victoire Jenamy (1749‚Äì1812), a daughter of Jean-Georges Noverre, a dancer who was one of Mozart's friends.Michael Lorenz, \\"¬ªMademoiselle Jeunehomme¬´ Zur L√∂sung eines Mozart-R√§tsels\\", Mozart Experiment Aufkl√§rung, (Essays for the Mozart Exhibition 2006) Da Ponte Institut, Vienna 2006, pp. 423‚Äì29.

The sub-committee was chaired by Baroness Wootton of Abinger. Originally intended to be a report on both cannabis and LSD, the panel members decided to limit their report to cannabis.  The Report  The second paragraph of the Report reads: > \\"Our first enquiries were proceeding ‚Äî without publicity ‚Äî into the > pharmacological and medical aspects, when other developments gave our study > new and increased significance. An advertisement in The Times on 24th July, > 1967 represented that the long-asserted dangers of cannabis were exaggerated > and that the related law was socially damaging, if not unworkable. This was > followed by a wave of debate about these issues in Parliament, the Press and > elsewhere, and reports of enquiries, e.g. by the National Council for Civil > Liberties. This publicity made more explicit the nature of some current > ‚Äòprotest‚Äô about official policy on drugs; defined more clearly some of the > main issues in our study; and led us to give greater attention to the legal > aspects of the problem. Government spokesmen made it clear that any future > development of policy on cannabis would have to take account of the Advisory > Committee‚Äôs Report. Accordingly, we decided to give first priority to > presenting our views on cannabis.\\" The Report seemed to give cannabis something resembling a clean bill of health. It said: > \\"The long term consumption of cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful > effects (‚Ä¶) Cannabis is less dangerous than the opiates, amphetamines and > barbiturates, and also less dangerous than alcohol. (‚Ä¶) An increasing number > of people, mainly young, in all classes of society are experimenting with > this drug, and substantial numbers use it regularly for social pleasure. > There is no evidence that this activity is causing violent crime, or is > producing in otherwise normal people conditions of dependence or psychosis > requiring medical treatment (‚Ä¶) there are indications that (cannabis) may > become a functional equivalent of alcohol.\\" The Advisory Committee appeared also to accept the principle of decriminalisation. The main proposal in the report was that \\"possession of a small amount of cannabis should not normally be regarded as a serious crime to be punished by imprisonment\\". The accompanying letter of submission to the Home Secretary said: \\"The committee is generally of the view that imprisonment is no longer an appropriate punishment for those who are unlawfully in possession of a small amount\\".  Responses  The Home Secretary at the time, James Callaghan, suggested he would reject the report. He told Parliament that on his reading, the committee had been \\"over-influenced\\" by the \\"lobby\\" for \\"legalisation\\" responsible for \\"that notorious advertisement\\", adding, \\"it was wrong for the committee to report on one drug in isolation in the way that it did\\".

First-class career Sievers began his career in 1930 for the Colts, at 17 years of age. Sievers was a useful right-handed lower order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Victoria in the seasons leading up to the Second World War. He made a lot of useful 50s for the state team, but his bowling was inclined to be expensive. Sievers toured South Africa in 1935‚Äì36 with the Australian cricket team under Vic Richardson but, with the Australian bowling dominated by the spin of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly, he was not called on for any of the Tests and took only seven first-class wickets on the tour. Test career Sievers' Test match experience came in the first three matches of the MCC tour under Gubby Allen in 1936‚Äì37. The Calgary Daily Herald, 8 December 1936 Curiously fragile batting by the Australians gave England commanding victories in both the first two matches, at Brisbane and at Sydney, and Sievers distinguished himself with neither ball nor bat. The third Test at Melbourne, however, saw a complete reversal of fortune, largely through the intervention of the weather. After Australia had struggled on the first day on a lifeless pitch, rain set in, so that when Donald Bradman declared at 200 for nine wickets and sent England in to bat, the pitch was of uncertain bounce, if any, and Sievers profited. When England declared having made just 76 for nine wickets, Sievers had taken five for 21, the best figures of the innings. Bradman then juggled his batting order to send expendable tail-enders in first and hit 270 himself on a by-now benevolent pitch. Australia won the match by 365 runs and went on to win the other two matches of the series to retain The Ashes. Sievers, though, was dropped from the English tour after his Melbourne effort and despite finishing at the top of the Australian bowling averages for the series, he never played Test cricket again. Sievers continued playing cricket until 1946, ending his career with an average just over 16 for his 270 First XI wickets. At the age of 56, he died from a heart attack in a hospital in Melbourne.

Playing career  Chursky grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia and attended Simon Fraser University where he graduated with a degree in English Literature. He is of Ukrainian descent. He joined the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1976 and finished with the league's best record for goalkeepers. Despite that, he did not gain any official recognition, whether as an All Star or Rookie of the Year. Chursky played three seasons for the Seattle Sounders before being traded to the California Surf for Al Trost in January 1979. The Surf turned around and traded him to the Chicago Sting later that season. In and finally the Toronto Blizzard. He played in 145 NASL regular season games and 11 play off games including Soccer Bowl 1977 against the New York Cosmos. Despite his outstanding career, Chursky will be remembered by many for the mistake which led to the Cosmos first goal over the Sounders in Pele's August 1977 final match. Chursky saved a shot, then put the ball on the ground and began dribbling towards his goal. Cosmos forward Steve Hunt rushed at Chursky who, due to being deaf in one ear, did not hear his teammates' cries. Hunt stole the ball, dribbled it towards the Seattle goal, pursued by Chursky, and scored the game's first goal. The Sounders tied the score before halftime. Giorgio Chinaglia then scored to win the game for the Cosmos in the second half. The Sounders best chance to tie was a low shot from super-sub Steve Buttle, which went wide right. Chursky played MISL pro indoor soccer for at least two seasons with the Tacoma Stars.  International career  Chursky made an impressive debut in goal for Canada against Poland on 1 August 1973 in Toronto in a 1‚Äì3 defeat while still an unknown amateur. He would go on to earn 19 caps with the national team. Chursky's final cap came on 14 October 1981 against Guadeloupe in Pointe-√†-Pitre in a 2‚Äì1 victory. He replaced Tino Lettieri at half time. Chursky also was a member of the Canadian squad at the 1975 Pan American Games.Pan-American Games 1975 (Mexico) - Match Details  Personal life  His son Alex Chursky is current Assistant Coach at Seattle University Athletics and was member of the Canada U-20 men's national soccer team.

History SPITFIRE was written in Turbo Pascal with Assembly Language routines. It was released in 1987 under the Shareware concept and had a moderate sized fanbase, only outnumbered by products such as RemoteAccess, TriBBS, PCBoard, Major BBS, and Wildcat! BBS. It was possible to run multiple \\"nodes\\" of SPITFIRE under Microsoft Windows and OS/2; although, most SysOps preferred to use Quarterdeck's DESQview for this purpose. SPITFIRE interfaced with message relaying systems such as FidoNet through 3rd party utilities such as SHILOH, a QWK networking interfacing program, and BCSUTI, a Postlink-style networking interface. SPITFIRE's most successful release (Version 3.2) came in 1992, just before the World Wide Web exploded on the scene. By 1994, many SysOps began converting from running BBSes to becoming Internet Service Providers. Mr. Woltz was greatly admired by loyal SysOps, but was known for being somewhat stubborn. Due to his unwillingness to add Internet connectivity to the software, SPITFIRE's usage dwindled significantly throughout the United States. It was and is still used throughout the world, particularly in countries where high-speed Internet access is unavailable or banned. However, due to advances in technology, SPITFIRE can be run as a telnet BBS by using a virtual FOSSIL driver and telnet engine (SIO/VMODEM under OS/2, NetFoss, NetSerial or [NetModem] under Windows).

He toured England as reserve wicket-keeper for the 1934 Australian Test team and his subsequent selection as wicket-keeper for the 1938 team attracted some controversy, other contenders being the aging Bert Oldfield and the contemporary Don Tallon. Barnett's cricket career was interrupted by World War II, during which he volunteered for the army and served with 8th Divisional Signals in Singapore. When Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, Barnett was incarcerated first in Changi Gaol and subsequently in Thailand on the railway. Acting as adjutant for 8th Div Sigs, Barnett maintained records which are now held in the Australian War Memorial (Canberra) and also the Signal's Museum in Wantirna, Melbourne. After the war, Barnett settled in England with his wife Mollie and sons Ian and Ross. Working at the time for the Australian firm Aspro-Nicholas, he played minor-counties cricket for Buckinghamshire. He represented Australia in the UK for both cricket and tennis and was voted President of the International Lawn Tennis Federation in 1964, a position he held for a number of years.

The novel was first published in 1997, by Voyager Books (UK) and HarperPrism (US). It is the final book in the Ultimate Dragon Saga trilogy. The book contains loose connections and foreshadowing to Edwards' later trilogy, the Stone series. In 1997, the British Fantasy Society nominated Dragonflame for Best Novel of the year. Plot summary Aria joins the sinister Cult of the Last Circle, an underground dragon community led by the evil Scarn. Scarn worships the Flame, which he believes has been sent to replace the charm lost from the world. After rescuing Aria from the Cult, Fortune escapes with his friends across the sea to Ocea. Scarn gives chase using the power of the Flame to travel great distances as if by magic. Meanwhile, Aria's son Wyrm (who has no wings) has set out on a pilgrimage around the world. There is a comet in the sky and Wyrm is obsessed with the Day of Creation. Along the way he encounters a tribe of 'natural faeries' who have lost both their magic and their wings - these are actually cavemen. Later Wyrm uncovers some ancient charm that enables him to grow wings, and he sets out for the Last Circle. Eventually, all the dragons meet in a huge crater in Ocea (the Last Circle) where a great battle ensues between Scarn's dragons (mutated by the evil power of the Flame) and Fortune's new allies, the mirror-dragons. At the climax of the battle, Scarn escapes. The comet drops from the sky and hits the crater. Everyone escapes except Wyrm, who is transformed from a single dragon into millions of birds. Fortune finally defeats Scarn. The dying power of the Flame opens a portal into a strange sideways world. Brace and Ledra go through the portal, which disappears.

The novel was first published in 1996 by Voyager Books (UK) and HarperPrism (US). It is the second book in the Ultimate Dragon Saga trilogy. This book introduces the dragon Archan, who returns in a larger role in Edwards' Stone trilogy. In 1996 the British Fantasy Society nominated Dragonstorm for Best Novel of the year. Plot summary The survivors from Dragoncharm have established a new dragon community on the island chain of Haven. Dragonstorm opens as Brace, Cumber and an ex-charmed dragon called Thaw lead an expedition to rescue the dragons still trapped in the canyon at Aether's Cross. Fortune and Gossamer remain on Haven, with their new daughter Aria. Fortune and his allies battle to prevent the community being split apart by the renegade Hesper. Meanwhile, the basilisk Ocher is seeking out his lost companions. Once gathered, the six basilisks - known as the Deathless - plan one last wielding of charm to bring about their own destruction. Brace and Cumber reach an ancient citadel built by the basilisks and inhabited by a blind ex-charmed dragon called Archan. The citadel's towers are mobile in time, constantly fading in and out of past, present and future. Archan seduces Thaw and imprisons the others. She has learned about the basilisks' plans and is scheming to steal their immortality. The basilisks are gathering what is left of the world's magic. A giant river of charm forms in the sky, flowing to the north pole, which the dragons call the Crest of the World. Hesper taps into this charm and convinces many of the Haven dragons that the magic is back. The community splits apart as the river of charm causes a great storm. The whole world starts changing shape. The shifting of the continents transports the whole of Haven island to Archan's citadel. Cumber and the others are rescued, but Fortune's daughter Aria is snatched by Archan and taken to the time-towers. The temporal effects cause Aria to grow to adulthood in the blink of an eye. Archan tricks Thaw into raping Aria, then kills him. Archan wants Aria to bear a perfect infant dragon to accompany Archan into immortality. She takes Aria to the north pole, ready for the ritual that will make her immortal. Brace and Cumber's party journey to a land of glaciers where they find the skeleton of Aether, the troll after whom the canyon of Aether's Cross was named. All the basilisks meet at the north pole and perform the ceremony of the Gathering of the Deathless. Fortune arrives just in time to save Aria from Archan. The basilisks achieve their goal and Archan becomes immortal, but her body is destroyed. She disappears into an iceberg, where she remains trapped and helpless, yet unable to die. All the basilisks are dead except Ocher, who is now mortal. Now life is precious, Ocher decides he wants to live a little longer. Brace arrives with the dragons he's just freed from Aether's Cross. Aria's egg brings wingless infant Wyrm into the world. The surviving dragons wonder if Wyrm represents what the future holds for their species, which is hovering on the brink of extinction.

These are other translation projects which are worthy of note which are not easily classified in the other groups: *Anchor Bible Series - Each book is translated by a different scholar, with extensive critical commentary. Most translations of the Bible have been authorized or made by religious people for religious use. However, historians and philologists study this Bible as an historical and literary text. *Black Bible Chronicles - This is a two volume set, an adaptive retelling of some parts of the Bible. The first volume draws from the Pentateuch, the second volume from the Gospels. *Jefferson Bible - Not a translation, but a work of United States President Thomas Jefferson that omits miracles from the gospel stories. Jefferson wished to extract the doctrine of Jesus by removing sections of the New Testament containing supernatural aspects as well as perceived misinterpretations he believed had been added by the Four Evangelists. In essence, Thomas Jefferson did not believe in Jesus' divinity, the Trinity, the resurrection, miracles, or any other supernatural aspect described in the Bible. *Modern Literal Version - The Modern Literal Version (MLV) is one of the earliest translations made making use of the computer for text editing (work beginning on a computer in 1989). It has been online since 1998 for people to view and offer translation suggestions and revisions, so that what the users agree to be the most accurate translation is the final product. *New English Translation - The NET Bible (acronym for New English Translation) is a free, on-line English translation of the Bible. *World English Bible - The World English Bible (also known as WEB) is a public domain translation of the Bible that is based on the 1901 American Standard Version, the Greek Majority Text, and the Hebrew Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia. *The Word on the Street - This is the Bible as performance art. In the words of the author, \\"No way is this the Proper Bible. It‚Äôs a trailer for, an intro to, an overview of The Bible (capital 'B'). For those who‚Äôve never read it, And those who‚Äôve read it so much it‚Äôs gone stale on them\\". *The Joseph Smith Translation. Emendations of the King James Version of the Bible, done by Joseph Smith Jr., the first president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Does not claim to be a translation based on actual documents, but rather claims to be inspired changes designed to restore truths to the Bible text that had become lost or changed since the original words were written. Smith died before it was completed. *Book of Yahweh - This \\"sacred name\\" version of the Bible is published by The House of Yahweh in Abilene, Texas. It is a modern English translation which uses the names Yahweh and Yahshua in place of God and Jesus. It also uses the Hebrew forms of place and personal names, particularly where the name of Yahweh is part of the name (such as Yeremyah for Jeremiah). Its translator claims it to be one of the most accurate English translations available anywhere today, although it eschews much of Christian theology and dogma due to its alleged pagan origins. It also does not distinguish between the Old and New Testaments, maintaining that the New Testament, rather than being a \\"New\\" covenant, is a \\"re-\\"newal of the \\"Old\\" covenant. * The Original Bible Project (OBP) is an attempt to make the translations from Hebrew and Greek into English as \\"transparent\\" and/or \\"literal\\" as possible; as of 2007, this translation is in progress and will eventually be released in stores as the Transparent English Bible (or TEB). However, as the translation progresses it will be made available for the public on the aforementioned website. More information can be found here. *100-Minute Bible - A summary of the Bible which can be read in 100 minutes. *The Wonder Book of Bible Stories - A Bible stories book from 1904. *The Word Made Fresh - Not strictly a translation, but a paraphrase of an English translation by Andrew Edington. It was published in three volumes in the latter half of the twentieth century. Unfortunately the style switches between extremely modern and King James style English, sometimes mid-sentence. Names of people and places are changed into more modern names. *God Is For Real, Man - Not strictly a translation, but a paraphrase of English translations by \\"street children\\", compiled by Carl F.

It is situated on the west bank of the Yass River, about 17 kilometres south of Gundaroo, near the Federal Highway, not far from Canberra. It has a primary school, an Anglican church (St Peter's), a general store, an estate agent, a rural supply store and a baker. Sutton has its own volunteer Bush Fire Brigade located in the village. Sutton began as a land reservation, surveyed by Robert Hoddle in 1835. In July 1866 the land reserve was again surveyed, this time by Edward Twynam who named the area after Joseph Sutton, the first person to come along the road at the time of the survey. He was a local resident, living at the Woodbury homestead, and son-in-law to William Guise, owner of Bywong Estate. The village of Sutton was officially gazetted in July 1867. Sutton public school was founded in 1870 as a provisional school and has existed continuously since 1880. The layout of the village has changed slightly over the past 150 years. Street names acknowledged Royalty, officials, pioneers and local gold rushes.

Benediction at a Carmelite friary in Ghent, Belgium Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, also called Benediction with the Blessed Sacrament or the Rite of Eucharistic Exposition and Benediction, is a devotional ceremony, celebrated especially in the Roman Catholic Church, but also in some other Christian traditions such as Anglo- Catholicism, whereby a bishop, priest, or a deacon blesses the congregation with the Eucharist at the end of a period of adoration.Congregation for Divine Worship, Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist outside Mass, 91 Exposition before the blessing The actual benediction or blessing follows exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, i.e., the placing of the consecrated Host in a monstrance set upon the altar or at least exposition of a ciborium containing the Blessed Sacrament.John A. Hardon, \\"Eucharist, Worship and Custody\\" Thus \\"the blessing with the Eucharist is preceded by a reasonable time for readings of the word of God, songs, prayers, and a period for silent prayer\\", while \\"exposition merely for the purpose of giving benediction is prohibited\\".Congregation for Divine Worship, Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist outside Mass, 89 The readings, songs and prayers are meant to direct attention to worship of Christ in the Eucharist. A prayerful spirit is encouraged also by periods of silence and by a homily or brief exhortations aimed at developing a better understanding of the mystery of the Eucharist.Diocese of San Diego, Rite of Eucharistic Exposition and Benediction Latin hymns traditionally sung during the exposition are \\"O Salutaris Hostia\\", \\"Tantum Ergo\\", \\"Laudate Dominum\\" (Psalm 117) and \\"Ave verum corpus\\". The Divine Praises are a prayer traditionally recited but no specific hymn or prayer is required, except that, immediately before the blessing, one or other of seven prayers given in the Rite of Eucharistic Exposition and Benediction, 98 and 224-229 is to be recited. Western Catholic Church Before publication of the 1973 Rite of Eucharistic Exposition and Benediction, there was no codification of the rite. However, the guidelines for the Diocese of Rome issued under Pope Clement XII (and hence called the Clementine Instruction) and drawn up by the Cardinal Vicar, Prospero Lambertini (later Pope Benedict XIV), were widely adopted. The rite now in force for the Latin Church requires the use of incense at the beginning of the exposition and before the blessing, if the Blessed Sacrament is exposed in a monstrance, but not if a ciborium is usedCongregation for Divine Worship, Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist outside Mass, 93 and 97 (although sometimes this is omitted). Similarly, the priest or deacon, wearing an alb or a surplice, should also put on a cope and use a humeral veil when giving the blessing with the Blessed Sacrament in a monstrance, but the cope is not required when using a ciborium.Congregation for Divine Worship, Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist outside Mass, 92 A person other than a priest or deacon authorized to expose the Eucharist for adoration cannot give the blessing with it.Congregation for Divine Worship, Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist outside Mass, 91 Immediately after the benediction, the Blessed Sacrament is replaced in the church tabernacle, while an acclamation such as \\"O sacrament most holy\\" is sung.Congregation for Divine Worship, Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist outside Mass, 100 Zucchetti are to be removed during the Benediction (and the preceding adoration) - they may only be donned again once the Blessed Sacrament is replaced. Eastern Christianity Among the Eastern Catholic churches, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, the Ruthenian Catholic Church, the Melkite Catholic Church,Melkite Greek Catholic Rite of Benediction and the Maronite Catholic Church, have a rite of Benediction. While Benediction with the Blessed Sacrament is not a practice of most Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox churches, or of the Assyrian Church of the East, these churches do believe in the Real Presence. As a sign of this, in many Eastern Orthodox churches, the Eucharist is venerated during the Divine Liturgy; however, this is part of the liturgy and not a distinct form of benediction. When the deacon brings the chalice out before the Communion of the Faithful, all either make a full prostration or bow. Also, at the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, during the Great Entrance, as the priest carries the chalice and diskos (paten) to the Holy Doors, everyone prostrates themselves in veneration before the Eucharist.Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA has had a rite of Benediction.

Gloydius himalayanus is a venomous pitviper species found along the southern slopes of the Himalayas in Pakistan, India and Nepal. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description The head is distinctly wide and elongated, with symmetrically arranged large scales. The dorsal scales are strongly keeled. An elongated postocular extends anteriorly to separate the eye from the supralabials. The dorsum is brownish, mottled or variegated to form a pattern of transverse bars. Ventral scales are white with black and red dots or speckles. Average length of these snakes is between . Dorsal scale count is \\"(20 to 23) - 21 (19 to 23) - 17 (15)\\", which means behind head, 20-23 rows; at midbody, usually 21 rows, but sometimes 19 or 23; just before vent, usually 17 rows, but sometimes 15. It is the only snake found in Pakistan with a pit (heat-sensing loreal pit) between the eye and nostril. Distribution Occurs along the southern slopes of the Himalayas from northeastern Pakistan, to northern India (Kashmir, Punjab) and Nepal. Reports that this species occurs in Sikkim, India, need to be confirmed. Habitat This is a highland snake and is found in altitudes ranging from in the mid and western Himalayas. It takes refuge under fallen timber, crevices, in or under rocks, beneath boulders, ledges, stones and fallen leaves. Behavior and diet This is a nocturnal and terrestrial species, often seen close to its hiding place, to which it retreats when disturbed. It is a lazy timid snake, moving slowly from one place to another. Its food consists mostly of millipedes, centipedes, and small rodents. Venom Bites from this species result in intense local pain and swelling, which usually subsides within two to three days, even without treatment. ReferencesFurther reading * Gloyd HK, Conant R. 1990.

As an example, consider one of the large wheels used to drive an aerial lift such as a ski lift. The wire cable wrapped around the wheel exerts a downward force on the wheel and the drive shaft supporting the wheel. Although the shaft, wheel, and cable move, the force remains nearly vertical relative to the ground. Thus a point on the surface of the drive shaft will undergo tension when it is pointing towards the ground and compression when it is pointing to the sky.  Types of cyclic stress  Cyclic stress is frequently encountered in rotating machinery where a bending moment is applied to a rotating part. This is called a cyclic bending stress and the aerial lift above is a good example. However, cyclic axial stresses and cyclic torsional stresses also exist. An example of cyclic axial stress would be a bungee cord (see bungee jumping), which must support the mass of people as they jump off structures such as bridges. When a person reaches the end of a cord, the cord deflects elastically and stops the person's descent. This creates a large axial stress in the cord. A fraction of the elastic potential energy stored in the cord is typically transferred back to the person, throwing the person upwards some fraction of the distance he or she fell. The person then falls on the cord again, inducing stress in the cord. This happens multiple times per jump. The same cord is used for several jumps, creating cyclical stresses in the cord that could eventually cause failure if not replaced.  Cyclic stress and material failure  When cyclic stresses are applied to a material, even though the stresses do not cause plastic deformation, the material may fail due to fatigue. Fatigue failure is typically modeled by decomposing cyclic stresses into mean and alternating components. Mean stress is the time average of the principal stress. The definition of alternating stress varies between different sources. It is either defined as the difference between the minimum and the maximum stress, or the difference between the mean and maximum stress. Engineers try to design mechanisms whose parts are subjected to a single type (bending, axial, or torsional) of cyclic stress because this more closely matches experiments used to characterize fatigue failure in different materials.

Benefits DMVPN provides the capability for creating a dynamic- mesh VPN network without having to pre-configure (static) all possible tunnel end-point peers, including IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) and ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) peers. DMVPN is initially configured to build out a hub-and-spoke network by statically configuring the hubs (VPN headends) on the spokes, no change in the configuration on the hub is required to accept new spokes. Using this initial hub-and-spoke network, tunnels between spokes can be dynamically built on demand (dynamic-mesh) without additional configuration on the hubs or spokes. This dynamic-mesh capability alleviates the need for any load on the hub to route data between the spoke networks.. Technologies * Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), , or multipoint GRE if spoke-to-spoke tunnels are desired * NHRP (next-hop resolution protocol), * IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) using an IPsec profile, which is associated with a virtual tunnel interface in IOS software. All traffic sent via the tunnel is encrypted per the policy configured (IPsec transform set) * An IP-based routing protocol, EIGRP, OSPF, RIPv2, BGP or ODR (DMVPN hub-and-spoke only).DMVPN Design Guide: Using a Routing Protocol Across the VPN Internal routing Routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP v1 or v2 or BGP are generally run between the hub and spoke to allow for growth and scalability. Both EIGRP and BGP allow a higher number of supported spokes per hub.DMVPN Design Guide: Routing Protocol Configuration Encryption As with GRE tunnels, DMVPN allows for several encryption schemes (including none) for the encryption of data traversing the tunnels. For security reasons Cisco recommend that customers use AES.DMVPN Design Guide: Best Practices and Known Limitations Phases DMVPN has three phases that route data differently. * Phase 1: All traffic flows from spokes to and through the hub. * Phase 2: Start with Phase 1 then allows spoke-to- spoke tunnels based on demand and triggers. * Phase 3: Starts with Phase 1 and improves scalability of and has fewer restrictions than Phase 2.

His family name was el Mezouari, from a title given an ancestor by Ismail Ibn Sharif in 1700, while El Glaoui refers to his chieftainship of the Glaoua (Glawa) tribe of the Berbers of southern Morocco, based at the Kasbah of Telouet in the High Atlas and at Marrakesh. El Glaoui became head of the Glaoua upon the death of his elder brother, Si el-Madani, and as an ally of the French protectorate in Morocco, conspired with them in the overthrow of Sultan Mohammed V. On October 25 of 1955, El-Glaoui announced his acceptance of Mohammed V's restoration as well as Morocco's independence.  Early life and career  alt= Thami was born in 1879 in the Imezouaren family, in the Ait Telouet tribe, a clan of the Southern Glaoua. His family was originally in a place called Tigemmi n'Imezouaren in the Fatwaka tribe, near the Tassaout river. His father was the qaid of Telouet, Mohammed ben Hammou, known as Tibibit, and his mother was Zouhra Oum El Kha√Ør, a black slave. When Si Mohammed died on 4 August 1886, his eldest son Si Mhamed took over his father's position and then died the same year. After the death of Si M'hammed, his brother Si Madani took power and put his brother T'hami as his khalifat (assistant). In the autumn of 1893, Sultan Moulay Hassan and his army were crossing the High Atlas mountains after a tax-gathering expedition when they were caught in a blizzard. They were rescued by Si Madani, and the grateful Sultan bestowed on Si Madani qaidats from Tafilalt to the Sous. In addition, he presented the Glaoua arsenal with a working 77-mm Krupp cannon, the only such weapon in Morocco outside the imperial army. The Glaoua army used this weapon to subdue rival warlords.Source: G. Maxwell, see References below In 1902, Madani, T'hami and the Glaoua force joined the imperial army of Moulay Abdelaziz as it marched against the pretender Bou Hamara. The Sultan's forces were routed by the pretender. Madani became a scapegoat, and spent months of humiliation at court before being allowed to return home. He thereupon began to actively work to depose Moulay Abdelaziz. This was achieved in 1907 with the enthronement of Abdelhafid of Morocco, who rewarded the Glaoua by appointing Si Madani as his Grand Vizier, and T'hami as Pasha of Marrakesh. French influence The ruinous reigns of Moulay Abdelaziz and Moulay Hafid bankrupted Morocco and led first to riots, then to armed intervention by the French to protect their citizens and financial interests. As the situation worsened, a scapegoat once again had to be found, and again it was the Glaoua. Moulay Hafid accused Madani of keeping back tax money, and in 1911 stripped all Glaoua family members of their positions. In 1912 the Sultan was forced to sign the Treaty of Fez, which gave the French immense control over the Sultan, his pashas and qaids. Later that year, the pretender El Hiba entered Marrakesh with his army and demanded of the new Pasha, Driss Mennou (who had replaced T'hami), that he hand over all foreign Christians as hostages. These had sought refuge with the former Pasha, T'hami, who had tried previously but failed to get them out of the district. T'hami handed over the hostages, except for a sergeant whom he hid and supplied with a line of communication with the approaching French army. The French scattered El Hiba's warriors, and Driss Mennou ordered his men to overpower El Hiba's guards and liberate the hostages. These then went to T'hami's place to collect their belongings, and were found there by the French army in circumstances which suggested T'hami alone had saved them. T'hami was restored to his position as Pasha on the spot. Seeing that the French were now the only effective power, T'hami aligned himself with them.Thami El Glaoui with his son, Brahim. Lord of the Atlas A pre-1923 depiction of Thami El Glaoui, Pasha of Marrakesh by Andr√© Sur√©da Madani died in 1918. The French immediately repaid T'hami's support by appointing him the head of the family ahead of Madani's sons. Only Si Hammou, Madani's son-in- law, managed to remain in his position as qaid of the Glawa (Aglaw in Tashelhit), based in Telouet (and therefore in charge of its arsenal). Not until Hammou died in 1934 did T'hami get full control of his legacy. From that time on, T'hami's wealth and influence grew. His position as Pasha enabled him to acquire great wealth by means which were often dubious, with interests in agriculture and mineral resources. His personal style and charm, as well as his prodigality with his wealth, made him many friends among the international fashionable set of the day. He visited the European capitals often, while his visitors at Marrakesh included Winston Churchill, Colette, Maurice Ravel, Charlie Chaplin.Source: Abdessadeq El Glaoui, see References below. The Pasha attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II as a private guest of Winston Churchill, the two had met during the latter's trips to Marrakech, often to paint. The Pasha's lavish gifts of a jeweled crown and an ornate dagger were refused as it was not customary for gifts to be received from individuals not representing a government.Thami el-Glawi (center) at his reception at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris in 1921, photographed with Abdelqader Bin Ghabrit (right).According to his son Abdessadeq, one of the principal means by which he acquired great landholdings was that he was able to buy land at cheap prices during times of drought. During one such drought, he constructed an irrigated private golf course at Marrakesh at which Churchill often played. When the French protested about the waste of water, they were easily silenced by granting playing rights to the top officials. T'hami had two wives: Lalla Zineb, mother of his sons Hassan and Abdessadeq and widow of his brother Si Madani; and Lalla Fadna, by whom he had a son, Mehdi, and a daughter, Khaddouj. Mehdi was killed fighting in the French forces at the Battle of Monte Cassino. T'hami also had a number of concubines, of whom he had children by three: Lalla Kamar (sons Brahim, Abdellah, Ahmed and Madani), Lalla Nadida (son Mohammed and daughter Fattouma) and Lalla Zoubida (daughter Saadia). The first two of these had originally entered T'hami's harem as musicians imported from Turkey. Collaboration with the French=Opposition to the nationalists As part of the resistance against the French occupation, a political party, the Istiqlal had started up with a nationalist (i.e. anti- colonialist) policy. T'hami and his son Brahim were supporters of the French, but several of T'hami's other sons were nationalists. This could be risky; he had one of them imprisoned in a dungeon. T'hami had grown up and lived most of his life as a feudal warlord, and so had many of the other pashas and qaids. Their opposition to the nationalists was based on conservatism: *The only line of communication between the people and the Sultan was by means of the pashas and qaids; this was the route by which tax money found its way to the Makhzen. No-one - certainly not the nationalists, who were mostly commoners - should breach this protocol. The pashas and qaids believed that this social order was to the benefit of their subjects as well as themselves. This was perhaps true to this extent: any pasha or qaid expressing a nationalist sympathy was likely to be stripped of his position by the French and replaced by either a puppet or even a French official to the detriment of their subjects. *As well as challenging traditional political power, the nationalists were also held to be responsible for endangering the spiritual leadership. Traditional religious sensibilities amongst the pashas and qaids were outraged by media pictures of royal princesses in bathing suits at the beach or by the pool. The nationalists were held to blame for introducing the Sultan to such new-fangled anti-Islamic ideas. Thami was not opposed to nationalism (in the sense of being against French colonialism) in itself, but was offended that it seemed to be associated with an upset of the established temporal and spiritual authority of the Sultan. Rupture with the sultan Two incidents led up to the rupture of relations between T'hami and Sultan Mohammed V. *Mesfioua incident: On 18 November 1950 nationalists staged a demonstration at a tomb in the ruins of Aghmat. This was brutally suppressed by police acting on the orders of the local qaid of the Mesfioua tribe. The Sultan, on hearing of this, commanded the qaid to appear before him to explain himself. This order would normally have gone to the qaid's superior, T'hami, but he was in Paris and it went instead to his deputy, his son Brahim. Brahim, instead of obeying, decided to consult his father, but omitted to obtain a definite response. The end result was that the Sultan's order was not carried out, and the Sultan gained the impression that the Glaoui family had deliberately ignored it. *Laghzaoui incident: the French had set up a Council of the Throne supposedly to advise the Sultan, but in reality to impose policy upon him. At a meeting of the Council on 6 December 1950, Mohammed Laghzaoui, a nationalist, was expelled by the person who effectively controlled the Council, the French Resident. The other nationalist members left with him, and were immediately received in private audience with the Sultan. This confirmed to T'hami that the nationalists and the Sultan were breaching established protocols of communication. At the annual Feast of Mouloud it was customary for the Sultan's subjects to renew their vows of loyalty to him. This was done in private audiences with the pashas and qaids, and by a public demonstration by their assembled tribe. T'hami's audience took place on 23 December 1950. Prior to this, Moulay Larbi El Alaoui, a member of the Makhzen had reportedly primed the Sultan to expect trouble from T'hami. The Sultan let it be known that he expected the audience to conform to the traditional pledges of loyalty with no political content. T'hami, however, started off by blaming the Mesfioua and Laghzaoui incidents on the nationalists. When the Sultan calmly responded that he considered the nationalists to be loyal Moroccans, T'hami exploded into a diatribe to which the Sultan could only sit speechless, judging it was better not to provoke a man who clearly had lost control of his passions. After T'hami exhausted himself, the Sultan continued his silence so T'hami left the palace. The Sultan then conferred with his Grand Vizier and Moulay Larbi and gave orders that T'hami was barred from appearing before him until further notice. After the Grand Vizier left to recall T'hami to receive this order, the next two qaids were admitted for their audience. As it happened these were Brahim and Mohammed, T'hami's sons, who were qaids in their own right. Brahim attempted to smooth things over by saying that T'hami had only spoken as a father might to his son. Suggesting that this was an acceptable way for a subject to speak to a king was in itself a breach of protocol which only made matters worse. When T'hami arrived back at the palace, the Grand Vizier told him that both he and his family were no longer welcome. T'hami then sent his assembled tribespeoples and subordinate qaids' home without waiting for the customary public demonstration of loyalty; this action was construed by the palace as open mutiny. Coup d'√©tat T'hami regarded the Sultan's order as a personal insult that must be wiped out at all costs. In addition, the Makhzen was dominated by Fassis (those from the city of Fez), and there was a traditional mutual distrust between the Fassis and those from Marrakesh. In T'hami's memory was the humiliation of himself and his brother Si Madani at the hands of a Fassi-dominated Makhzen during the reigns of Moulay Abdelaziz and Moulay Hafid. From that moment on he conspired with Abd El Hay Kittani and the French to replace Mohammed V with a new sultan, an elderly member of the royal family named Ben Arafa. On 17 August 1953, Kittani and the Glaoui unilaterally declared Ben Arafa to be the country's imƒÅm. On 25 August 1953, the French Resident had the Sultan and his family forcibly seized and deported to exile, and Ben Arafa was proclaimed the new sultan. Popular uprising against the coup T'hami had already participated in one dethronement of a sultan in 1907, which had been met with popular indifference. With this \\"ossified\\" memory, he never expected another dethronement would lead to an insurrection. The great mistake made by T'hami and his associated pashas and qaids, according to his son Abdessadeq, was that unlike Mohammed V they simply failed to realise that by 1950 Moroccan society had evolved to the stage where feudal government was no longer acceptable to their subjects. A popular uprising began, directed mainly against the French but also against their Moroccan supporters. French citizens were massacred, the French forces responded with equal brutality, and French colonists began a campaign of terrorism against anyone (Moroccan or French) who expressed nationalist sympathies. T'hami was the target of a grenade attack, which did not however injure him. His chamberlain Haj Idder (formerly a slave of Si Madani) was injured in another such attack, and on recovery came to oppose the French. Finally, an all-out war began in the Rif. Rallying to the sultan Thami El- Glaoui ca. 1950 T'hami was at first totally prepared to support the French, machine gun in hand if necessary. He was shaken, however, by the political \\"reforms\\" which the French began to demand to consolidate their hold on power, which would have had the same outcome as what he had feared from the nationalists: the eventual removal of the pashas and qaids. The French government, unnerved by way the country was rapidly becoming ungovernable, slowly began to think about how it might undo what had happened. T'hami detected this and equally slowly became as receptive to his nationalist son Abdessadeq as he had formerly been to his pro-French son Brahim. Ben Arafa abdicated on 1 August 1955. The French brought Mohammed V to France from exile, but also created a \\"Council of the Throne\\" as a caretaker government. T'hami now no longer believed in anything the French said, and pointedly refused them support to suppress a student strike. By 17 October, T'hami had decided to notify the French and their Council that he supported the restoration of Mohammed V as Sultan. This notification was never sent, apparently because Brahim became aware of his intention and began his own negotiations with French interests. T'hami was shocked into a sudden suspicion that Brahim may have been planning to supersede him. To forestall this, Abdessadeq arranged a meeting between his father and leading nationalists, which took place over dinner on 25 October. At this meeting an announcement was drawn up in which T'hami recognized Mohammed V as rightful Sultan. The next day, as soon as T'hami had addressed the Council of the Throne, the announcement was read out by Abdessadeq to a waiting crowd and simultaneously released to the media by nationalists in Cairo. The whole of Morocco was now united in the demand for the Sultan's restoration, and the French had no choice but to capitulate. T'hami flew to France and on 8 November 1955 knelt in submission before Mohammed V, who forgave him his past mistakes. Personal fortune El Glaoui was one of the world's richest men following Pacha Boujemaa Mesfioui of Beni Mellal. He took a tithe of the almond, saffron and olive harvests in his vast domain, owned huge blocks of stock in French-run mines and factories, and received a rebate on machinery and automobiles imported into his realm. El Glaoui's fortune was somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million at the time, more than $880 million, adjusted for inflation. Epilogue El Glaoui died during his night prayers on 23 January 1956, not long after the return of the Sultan. His properties and wealth were later seized by the state. Hassan El Glaoui, another son of T'hami, is one of the best-known Moroccan figurative painters, with works selling for more than hundred of thousands pounds at Sotheby's. https://amp.ft.com/content/bb13a174-55fd-11e9-8b71-f5b0066105fe Abdessadeq El Glaoui, the son of Thami El Glaoui, and a past Moroccan ambassador to the USA, has written a book about his father and his relations with the French and the monarchy.Interview (in French) with Abdessadeq El Glaoui in Hebdo Press (2004) Maroc Hebdo , the granddaughter of Thami El Glaoui, daughter of Hassan El Glaoui, is the founder of the 1:54 African art Fair. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/arts/touria-el-glaoui-african-art- frieze.amp.html Mehdi El Glaoui, the grandson of Thami El Glaoui, son of Brahim El Glaoui, famous for his role as S√©bastien in the television series Belle et S√©bastien Brice Bexter, great-grandson of Thami El Glaoui, grandson of Hassan El Glaoui, is a rising Moroccan and international actor.https://variety.com/2020/film/news/andy-garcia-action-drama-redemption- day-1203486366/  Honours  *Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur (1925) *Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur (1919) *Commandeur of the L√©gion d'honneur (1913) *Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur (1912) *Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur (1912) *Croix de Guerre 1914‚Äì1918 with two palms (1916 at Sektana and 1917 at Tiznit) Notes References  *Lords of the Atlas, by Gavin Maxwell ().

Description Adults may attain a total length of , which includes a tail long.Boulenger. 1896. p. 560. Dorsally, T. macrolepis is bright green, with blackish skin between the scales in some places. There is a yellow or white stripe on each side of the body, which runs along the first dorsal scale row. The upper lips are pale green, and there may be a black streak behind the eye. Ventrally, it is pale greenish. The dorsal scales, which are large, keeled, and overlapping, are arranged in only 12-15 rows at midbody. The dorsal scales in the 10 middle rows are always the largest, and additional rows are made up of smaller scales. An even number of dorsal scale rows is frequently found in this species, even though it is uncommon in snakes in general. Ventrals 133-143; subcaudals divided 44-58. The scales on the top of the head are very large, smooth, and overlapping. There is an elongate subocular, which is separated from the upper labials by a row of a few small scales. There are 7-8 upper labials, of which the 3rd is the largest. Taxonomy Trimeresurus macrolepis has a long spineless hemipenis without papillae; the hemipenis has a long calyculate region beginning at some distance from the fork of the hemipenis and continuing until the tip. This is a characteristic similar to vipers of the Trimeresurus popeiorum group. In addition, it has enlarged head scales, somewhat akin to those of Agkistrodon species. Based on these characters, and its Western Ghats distribution, Malhotra and Thorpe (2004) resurrected the genus Peltopelor G√ºnther, 1864 for this species. The resurrection of new genera from Trimeresurus by Malhotra & Thorpe was accepted by most subsequent authors. However, the creation of the new genera created a problem, in that the new genera did not form a distinct clade, as Trimeresurus had done and also were not distinct morphologically from one another other in the clade. Based on this view, Peltopelor has been reduced by David, Vogel & Dubois (2011) to the status of a subgenus, so that the latest taxonomic classification of this snake is Trimeresurus (Peltopelor) macrolepis. Habitat Trimeresurus macrolepis is a slow-moving, arboreal, nocturnal snake that prefers rainforests, and is also found in tea, coffee and cardamom plantations. Behavior It is both terrestrial and arboreal, using its prehensile tail to hold onto branches. It is an ambush hunting snake relying on its camouflage to catch prey. The heat-sensing loreal pits are used to locate warm-blooded prey.Cambell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Comstock. Ithaca and London. 870 pp., 1500 plates. . Diet It feeds mainly on frogs, lizards, small birds and rodents. Venom Presumed to contain hemotoxin, but not that thoroughly studied. Even though tea pickers are frequently bitten by this species, the bites are seldom fatal. Reproduction Trimeresurus macrolepis is oviparous. Sexually mature females lay eggs in October, in clutches of 4-7. Close up of head ReferencesFurther reading * Beddome, R.H. 1862. Notes upon the land and freshwater Snakes of the Madras Presidency.

Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to Western Ghats mountains, occurring along the southern and western India at elevation. The type locality is the Western Ghats of southwestern India. Records of this species are from Agasthyamalai, Travancore hills, Periyar Tiger Reserve, Meghamalai, Palni hills, Anaimalai, parts of lower, western Nilgiris, Wayanad, Coorg, Malnad region of Karnataka, Castle Rock, Goa and northwards into Maharashtra in the Amboli hills. It inhabits riparian forests and is very partial to hill streams and torrents, situated within dense wet rainforests, sometimes also evergreen and deciduous forests, where it may be found on the ground, on rocks present in stream beds, on low vegetation, or in shrubs. Recently it is found in Korba District of Chhattisgarh. It is the first time this variety is found somewhere else than Western Ghats. Ecology The Malabar pit viper is nocturnal and usually inactive in the day, sometimes seen basking on rocks or trees near streams. It is more commonly encountered during the monsoon months. The species preys upon frogs, lizards, nestling birds, musk shrews, mice and other small animals. Venom T. malabaricus is slow- moving, but capable of fast strikes. Its venom causes moderate pain and swelling to humans. These symptoms subside in a day or two. ReferencesFurther reading *Jerdon, T.C. 1854 [\\"1853\\"].

The class was custom-made for steep hills and slow speeds; it featured a low weight which, with a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement, allows for a axle load. This made the locomotives only long. They had a power output of , a tractive effort of and a maximum speed of . They were given road numbers 2062 though 2064. __TOC__ History With the construction of the Bergen Line, which was completed in 1909, it was decided that there would be built branch lines to two fjords, the Hardanger Line to Hardangerfjord and the Fl√•m Line to Sognefjord.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 16 Both branches were steep and curvy, which set high demands on the locomotives. The Hardanger Line was long, had a maximum gradient of 4.5 percent, a minimum curve radius of , and a maximum speed of .Hordaland County Municipality (1981): 22Aspenberg (1994): 250 The Fl√•m Line is long, had a maximum gradient of 5.5. percent, a minimum curve radius of and a maximum speed of uphill and downhill.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 125 Both lines had a maximum permitted axle load of , standard gauge and a electrification system. The Hardanger Line opened in 1935Aspenberg (1994): 251 and the Fl√•m Line in 1940,Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 56 although the latter did not receive electric traction until 1944.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 63 Originally, the Hardanger Line used Class 64 electric multiple units. On 28 March 1940, NSB sent an invitation to tender for two multiple units which would be similar to Class 64. The company asked both for aluminum and steel bids. However, NSB abandoned the plans and instead signed an agreement on 4 October 1940 for delivery of three electric locomotives. The units were intended to be delivered in 1942. The mechanical components and assembly was done by Thune, and electrical parts were delivered by NEBB, except the transformer and electric controllers, which were built by Per Kure.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 64 By 1944, by which time Norway was occupied by Germany as part of the Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Fl√•m Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, in part because of the general lack of materials, and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 65 The locomotives received transformers in 1947, which were installed in Oslo, and 2064 was delivered on 24 May. The cost of the three locomotives was 1,297,905 million Norwegian krone. At first, only one unit was transferred to Fl√•m. The other two remained in Eastern Norway; one was stationed as a shunter at Oslo West Station, the other in Skien. The units operating in Oslo and Skien had problems with the rheostatic brake operating differently depending on the direction the train was running, something which was not observed in Fl√•m. The issue was fixed by marginally changing the excitation voltage. The unit stationed in Fl√•m was periodically sent for service in Oslo, and when this happened, a new unit would be stationed in Fl√•m. From 21 January 1949, 2064 was returned to Fl√•m without the other unit being sent back. From 17 February 1955, all three were stationed in Fl√•m.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 66 During the late 1950s, one of the units was stationed as Voss Station for shunting duty.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 71 Starting in the late 1950s, the class was also used on the Hardanger Line.Aspenberg (1994): 253 El 9.2064 is preserved at Tinnoset Station. In the 1970s, NSB started to consider replacement of the class. In 1971 and 1973, El 11 and El 13 were test-run on the line, and it was concluded that El 11 would be suitable with minor adjustments. However, the 1960s replacement of steam locomotives had caused a shortage of electric locomotives. Not until 1980 did NSB start the upgrade process of two El 11s.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 83 From 1980s, only a single El 9 was stationed on the Fl√•m Line during winter, and the other two were used for local trains on the Bergen Line in Hallingdal. If the unit stationed in Fl√•m was out of order, it was replaced by a Class 64 unit. Lack of spare parts and limited reliability accelerated the need to replace the units in scheduled trains.Aspenberg (2001): 73 The first unit was taken into use on the Fl√•m Line in 1983 and the second in 1984. Two El 9s were transferred to √Öl Station and Voss Station where they hauled work trains.Gubberud & Sunde (1992): 84 Unit 2062 was taken out of service in 1983.Aspenberg (2001): 74 The other two remained in regular service until 1988. Unit 2063 has been painted green and is on display at Fl√•m Station, while 2064 has retained the red color scheme and is stored at Tinnoset Station, belonging to the Norwegian Railway Museum. Specifications The locomotives each have four NEBB EDTM423 motors, giving a combined power output of .Thue (2002): 75 The main transformer is capable of feeding each motor with 765 kilovolt-ampere (kVA), 115 kVA to heating and 40 kVA for axillary equipment. The power output is regulated with through 28 steps in the voltage regulator which is integrated with the main transformer. The locomotives have a maximum speed of and a tractive effort of . Because of the limited roof space, only one pantograph was installed. The limit on axle load makes the locomotives small and compact. They weigh , and the total train weight is limited to . This also gives the trains a short length of . The trains had a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. In addition to air brakes for the whole train, the locomotives are equipped with rheostatic brakes which is sufficiently powerful to allow for the 5.5 percent gradient. When braking, three of the motors are connected to the air-cooled resistance on the roof, while the last motor is connected to deliver magnetization current to the other three motors. The braking is regulated with 22 steps. As a backup, the units are equipped with a carborundum track brake on each side of the bogies.

After the first attack during Operation Trident on the Port of Karachi, Pakistan stepped up aerial surveillance of its coast as the presence of large Indian Navy ships gave the impression that another attack was being planned. Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched on the night of 8/9 December 1971. A strike group consisting of one missile boat and two frigates attacked the group of ships off the coast of Karachi. While India suffered no losses, Pakistani fleet tanker was damaged beyond repair, and the Kemari Oil Storage facility was lost. Two other foreign ships stationed in Karachi were also sunk during the attack. Background In 1971, the Port of Karachi housed the headquarters of the Pakistan Navy and almost the entire Pakistan Naval fleet was based at Karachi Harbour. It was also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade. Pakistan Air Force's shore-based aircraft were tasked with providing uninterrupted cover to Karachi port, against any possible air strikes. It also gained significance as it was the only seaport in West Pakistan. Towards the end of 1971, there were rising tensions between India and Pakistan, and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s in the vicinity of Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also be operating in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a demarcation line which ships in their fleet would not cross. Later this deployment proved to be useful to gain experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began. Operation=Prelude The Indian Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Delhi along with the Western Naval Command planned to attack the strategically important Port of Karachi. A strike group under Western Naval Command, was formed. This strike group was to be formed around the three Vidyut-class missile boats already deployed off the coast of Okha. However these had limited operational and radar range and to overcome this difficulty, it was decided to assign support vessels to the group. On 4 December, what was now designated as the Karachi Strike Group was formed and consisted of the three Vidyut-class missile boats: , and , each armed with four SS-N-2B Styx surface-to-surface missiles with a range of , two anti- submarine corvettes: and , and a fleet tanker, . The group was under the command of Commander Babru Bhan Yadav, the Commanding Officer of the 25th Missile Boat Squadron. On the night of 4/5 December, the Indian Navy launched Operation Trident with the Karachi Strike Group off the coast of Karachi. This operation saw the first use of anti-ship missiles in combat in the region and inflicted heavy damage on the Pakistanis. While India suffered no losses, Pakistan lost one minesweeper, one destroyer, a cargo vessel carrying ammunition, and fuel storage tanks in Karachi. Another destroyer was also badly damaged and had, eventually, to be scrapped. The Pakistan Air Force retaliated against these attacks by bombing Okha Harbour, scoring direct hits on fueling facilities for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and the missile boats' jetty. The Indian Navy had anticipated this attack and had already moved the missile boats to other locations to prevent any losses. The destruction of the fueling facilities, however, prevented any further incursions until Operation Python was executed three days later. Though the Indian Navy had strategic victory with Operation Trident, its main target, the oil storage facilities in Karachi were still operational as only one of the two missiles fired had hit them. This failure was later assessed as the result of confusion created between the commanding officers of the three missile boats. Furthermore, the Indians mistook tracer fire from the coastal artillery of Karachi as originating from Pakistani aircraft and retreated hurriedly before they could properly target the tanks. After the first attack during Operation Trident on the Port of Karachi, Pakistan stepped up aerial surveillance of its coast as the presence of large Indian Navy ships gave the impression that another attack was being planned. Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched. Attack On the night of 8/9 December 1971, at 10:00 pm Pakistan Standard Time (PKT), in rough seas, a small strike group consisting of the missile boat , equipped with four Styx missiles, and two multipurpose frigates, and , approached Manora, a peninsula south of the Port of Karachi. During their voyage, a Pakistani patrol vessel was encountered and sunk. The Indian Navy's official historian, Vice Admiral Hiranandani in his book Transition to Triumph, mentioned that while the group approached Karachi, Trishul's electronic surveillance revealed that the radar there had stopped rotating and was directed straight at the group, confirming that it had been detected. Around 11.00 pm (PKT), the group detected a batch of ships at a distance of . Vinash immediately fired four of its missiles, the first of which struck the fuel tanks at the Kemari Oil Farm causing a heavy explosion. Another missile hit and sank the Panamanian fuel tanker SS Gulf Star. The third and fourth missiles hit the Pakistani Navy fleet tanker PNS Dacca and the British merchant vessel SS Harmattan. Dacca was damaged beyond repair, while Harmattan sank. As Vinash had now expended all of its missiles, the group immediately withdrew to the nearest Indian port. Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force attacks on Karachi's fuel and ammunition depots, more than fifty percent of the total fuel requirement of the Karachi zone was reported to have been destroyed. The result was a crippling economic blow to Pakistan. The damage was estimated to be worth $3 billion, with most of the oil reserves and ammunition warehouses and workshops destroyed. The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel. Aftermath With no casualties observed on the Indian side, both missile attacks (Trident and Python) led the Pakistan Navy to take extreme measures to prevent any further damage. The rescue efforts were immediately coordinated by Rear Admiral Patrick Simpson who kept morale high among the Pakistani Navy officers. For this, he was awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat. Lieutenant Commander Vijai Jerath, the commanding officer of Vinash, was awarded the Vir Chakra for this operation. The Pakistani High Command ordered ships to reduce their ammunition dumps so as to reduce the explosion damage if hit. The ships were also ordered not to manoeuvre out at sea, especially during the night, unless ordered to do so. These two measures severely demoralized Pakistani naval crews. With the destruction caused by the Indian Navy, neutral merchant vessels soon started to seek safe passage from the Indian authorities before heading to Karachi. Gradually, neutral ships ceased sailing for Karachi. In effect, a de facto naval blockade was created by the Indian Navy.

Mitchell is also known as \\"Accordion Guy\\" to viewers of ABC-TV's quirky, overnight broadcast, World News Now. He started contributing topical song parodies to the program in 1992, and later became its roving feature reporter, conducting celebrity interviews and scouring the country for oddball stories and personalities. Mitchell played accordion in Long Island, NY wedding bands in the mid-1970s, and later worked as a radio newswriter for WHLI-AM. In the late 1970s he worked briefly for NBC Radio News and Information Service in Rockefeller Center before starting to earn a living as a stand-up comedian. In 1992, Mitchell wrote and performed what was to become World News Now's signature closing theme, the tongue-in-cheek \\"World News Polka\\". Many different versions of the Polka were created over the years, the most famous being the music video in which Mitchell was accompanied by two attractive female singers dressed in journalistic trenchcoats, who sang backup while waving large hand microphones, with many in-jokes acknowledging Disney's ownership of ABC. Other versions of Mitchell's Polka include one featuring an Elvis impersonator, another with an all-ukulele band, and one starring a water-harpist. In June, 2015, Kermit The Frog of The Muppets sang a memorable Polka duet with Mitchell on accordion and Kermit on banjo: \\"I hear they watch us in the Swamp and think that we're all right/Well, it sure beats croaking in the middle of the night.\\" In the 1980s, Mitchell's uncanny impression of Woody Allen earned him parts in TV commercials and sketch work on Saturday Night Live and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In between, he has written monologue material for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Wayne Cotter of Fox's Comic Strip Live. In 2004, he was part of the writing team for That Was The Week That Was, ABC's short-lived attempt to revive the 1963 BBC satire series as a segment of Primetime Live. Since May, 2005, Mitchell has worked as a producer/reporter for CUNY-TV, the public affairs cable channel of the City University of New York, available in the five boroughs of New York City on Channel 75 and online at cuny.tv. He won an Emmy Award there, in 2012.

Adult colouration varies from light brown to dull yellow-green and often a startling fluorescent green. The type and number of scales is used to identify the snakes. In this species the Internasals are usually in contact with the labial or lip scales. There are one to four small loreals between the prefrontal and the labial scales. The frontal is as long as its distance from the end of the snout or a little longer and a little longer than the parietal scales. There is one preocular scale in front of the eye, which is in contact with the frontal scale. There two postocular scales (behind the eyes). The temporal scales come in patterns of 2+2 or 3+3, rarely 1+2. Of the upper labial scales, the ninth, fourth, fifth, and sixth enter the eye while the 4 lower labials are in contact with the anterior chin-shields, which are shorter than the posterior chin-shields. The scales in 15 rows and are usually faintly keeled on the sacral \\\\ region. There are 203-234 Ventral scales which are anal divided. There are 167 to 203 subcaudals which are bright green, pale olive, or grey- brown, with a yellow line along each side of the lower parts. The interstitial skin of the neck is black and white.Boulenger, G.A. 1890. Fauna of British India. Reptilia and Batrachia. British Museum. London. p. 369.
