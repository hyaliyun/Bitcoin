In the novel, it is stated that the Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang had visited the monastery while returning from India in the 7th century.

The site lies along a hill and is 250 meters long. It is located south of Lake Koul-e Heshmatkhan, south of Kabul and was discovered beneath a modern police station. The monastery consists of five small stupas for meditation and five chapels. The Afghan Institute of Archaeology continues to excavate at the site for one month each summer since 2005.

Kerr, Edwin B. Aldrich and E. C. Sammons established the Oregon State College Foundation with the aid of OSC President A. L. Strand. They saw the foundation as a means of creating opportunities that the college could not fulfill with state funds alone. That year they collected the OSC Foundation's first donation, a sum of five dollars. The OSC Foundation officially became the Oregon State University Foundation on November 14, 1962. The university's endowment began with $20,000 in 1961. It took 16 years to reach its first $1 million in total receipts, and four more years to double that amount. Today the university's composite endowment totals more than $600 million, with earnings distributed annually. With university leaders, the OSU Foundation publicly launched Oregon State's first comprehensive fundraising campaign, The Campaign for OSU, on October 26, 2007, with a goal of $625 million. Donors exceeded the original goal in October 2010, nearly a year ahead of schedule, and the goal was increased to $850 million. In March 2012 the goal was raised to $1 billion. At OSU's annual State of the University address in Portland on January 31, 2014, President Edward J. Ray announced that campaign contributions had passed $1 billion, putting Oregon State with a group of 35 other public universities to cross the billion-dollar fundraising mark and one of only two organizations in the Pacific Northwest to reach the $1 billion campaign milestone. The Campaign for OSU concluded on December 31, 2014, with more than $1.1 billion from 106,000 donors.

It was first published in an abridged form in the Cornhill Magazine in 1947,The Cornhill Magazine, vol. 162 (1947). and then by Chapman & Hall, also in 1947. The first American edition, by Little, Brown, appeared in 1949. Plot Set shortly after the end of the Second World War, the story's central character is Scott-King, a middle-aged schoolmaster who for twenty-one years has taught classical languages at Granchester, an English public school which is his own old school.David Wykes, Evelyn Waugh: a literary life, p. 151. Cautious and monosyllabic, he is described by Waugh as \\"a praiser of the past and a lover of exact scholarship\\", and is characterized as representing the old-fashioned virtues of honesty, decency, sanity, and, ultimately, heroism.Jonathan Rose, The Revised Orwell (1992), p. 110. During his summer vacation, Scott-King visits Neutralia, a totalitarian republic ruled by a military dictator who was able to keep his country from becoming embroiled in the recent World War. The occasion for Scott-King's visit to Simona, the capital city, is that by publishing an English language translation of a long Latin poem by Bellorius, a minor 17th-century Neutralian poet, followed by a monograph on Bellorius himself, he has come to be seen as a leading authority on the work. He has therefore been invited by the government of Neutralia to take part in a scholarly conference marking the poet's tercentenary. Unhappily, Scott-King does not think to inform the British government of his visit.Books: Journey to Neutralia dated February 21, 1949, at time.com, accessed 11 June 2011.Philip Malcolm Waller Thody, The Conservative Imagination (1993), p. 146. At the same time as the Bellorius Tercentenary, Neutralia is hosting several other events, including a large philatelic conference and an international gathering of women athletes, and in Simona Scott-King meets a variety of remarkable characters. One of these, a scholar from Switzerland, is murdered, and Scott- King is tricked into laying a wreath for a questionable hero and unveiling a statue which is not what it seems, causing him to flee Simona disguised as a nun. On arrival at a Mediterranean seaport, he finds himself surrounded by anarchists, monarchists, Trotskyites, prostitutes, ballet dancers, former Gestapo officers, and Vichy collaborators. After a long sea journey, he arrives without his passport at a camp for Jewish illegal immigrants in the British Mandate for Palestine, where he is treated with suspicion until he is recognized by an old boy of his school and is thus able to establish his true identity. Message It seems at first ironic that the life work of Bellorius was in describing a fictional utopian island in the New World. However, the moral of Scott-King's Modern Europe is that attempts to create a rational Utopia should be expected to result in a repressive dystopia. The conclusion of the story is the decision by Scott-King that \\"It would be very wicked indeed to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world.\\" A satire on post-1945 totalitarianism, the story sets out in particular Waugh's attitudes towards communism in the Balkans and is plainly also an attack on the drabness of the continent following the Second World War.Jeffrey M. Heath, The Picturesque Prison: Evelyn Waugh and his writing (1982), pp. 184‚Äì186.Andrew Hammond, The Balkans and the West: constructing the European other, 1945‚Äì2003 (2004), p. 48. Background Waugh gathered most of his material for the story from a trip he made to Franco's Spain in the summer of 1946 with Douglas Woodruff, editor of The Tablet, to attend events marking the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, claimed by some as the father of international law.Martin Stannard, Evelyn Waugh, Volume II: No Abiding City 1939‚Äì1966 (London: Flamingo, 1993), p. 168.

Adrian originated from an area of disturbed weather which had developed during the course of early June, off the Pacific coast of Mexico. On June 7, it acquired a sufficiently organized structure with deep convection to be classified as a tropical cyclone, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as Tropical Depression One-E, the first one of 2011. It further strengthened to be upgraded into a tropical storm later that day. Adrian moved rather slowly; briefly recurving northward after being caught in the steering winds. After steady intensification, it was upgraded into a hurricane on June 9. The storm subsequently entered a phase of rapid intensification, developing a distinct eye with good outflow in all quadrants. Followed by this period of rapid intensification, it obtained sustained winds fast enough to be considered a major hurricane and reached its peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane that evening. Adrian weakened throughout June 10 to June 12 as increased vertical wind shear persisted around its vicinity. It was downgraded into a tropical storm on June 11 as the once organized structure deteriorated, further so into a tropical depression the following day. Adrian subsequently decayed into a remnant low-pressure area with very little convection, all dislocated to the northeast of the low- level center. Degeneration continued and Adrian disintegrated into a swirl of low clouds, drifting due to the northwest. Since Adrian stayed at sea, its effects along coastlines were limited. Damages, if any, remains unknown, and no fatalities were reported as a result of the Adrian. Meteorological history By June 3, a surface low formed off an area of disturbed weather that existed several hundred miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico during the first few days of June. Slow development of this system was anticipated by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Remaining nearly stationary, it managed to produce a few disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Favorable environmental conditions allowed gradual organization, and convection became better defined on June 5. It subsequently acquired sufficiently organized structure to be recognized as a tropical cyclone and NHC initiated advisories on the newly formed tropical depression One-E at 1200 UTC, June 7 while it was located around 365 mi (590 km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. As a tropical depression, it was situated over warm sea surface temperatures of around . Upper-level wind shear in its vicinity were minimal, which was also conducive for intensification. As a result, the tropical depression continued to become better organized, with a large rainband flaring up to the west of the circulation. Based on the improved appearance on satellite imagery, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adrian at 0000 UTC on June 8, twelve hours after formation. Briefly caught within light steering winds, Adrian tracked toward the north-northwest. Continuing to increase in deep convection, NHC re-assessed the intensity to 60 mph (95 km/h) at around 0900 UTC. By nightfall, the eye-like feature developed into a central dense overcast (CDO), and at around 0000 UTC on June 9, the NHC upgraded Adrian to a minimal hurricane as it attained sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Hurricane Adrian at peak intensity on June 10, while transitioning to an annular hurricane Later that day, a well-defined eye formed beneath the CDO and the surrounding cloud tops reached below , indicating intensification is present. Adrian rapidly deepened, and over the following 24 hours, it is estimated by satellite observations that winds increased from 80 mph (120 km/h) to 140 mph (240 km/h) and its barometric pressure decreased by 43 mbar (hPa; 1.27 inHg), going from a category 1 to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS). During that time, its eye became more distinct, and the upper-level outflow was symmetrical. Throughout most of June 9, Adrian began transitioning into an annular hurricane, displaying a large and circular eye around in diameter, devoid of any convective banding. Contrary to previous predictions by the NHC, Adrian continued to intensify, reaching its peak intensity at around 0000 UTC on June 10 while located about 320 mi (515 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. When Adrian peaked, it had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88 inHg). Later that morning, convection associated with the Adrian had lessened. Initially, NHC suggested slow weakening could occur due to progressively cooler water temperatures. By then, Adrian also began moving into a more stable environment with stronger westerly wind shear, which is highly unfavorable for the sustaining tropical cyclones. By June 11, Adrian's eye completely disappeared on satellite imagery, and it no longer maintained its symmetrical structure. Steered by a low-to-mid-level ridge over the northeastern Pacific, Adrian recurved to the west, traversing sea surface temperatures cooler than . Deteriorating faster than anticipated due to an unexpected increase in wind shear, Adrian weakened back into a tropical storm around 1800 UTC on June 11. Soon enough, Adrian degenerated into a tight swirl of low-level clouds with very limited deep convection. Intermittent bursts of deep convection kept satellite intensity estimates at 45 mph (65 km/h), briefly halting the weakening process. Weakening resumed and Adrian degenerated into a tropical depression six hours later, and subsequently decaying into a remnant low-pressure area at around 1200 UTC on June 12 while located about 585 mi (940 km) southwest of the southernmost tip of Baja California peninsula. Devoid of any convection, the remnant low of Adrian continued to move west for roughly two days, until gradual dissipation, as the low-level circulation opened up into a surface though. Preparations and impact As Adrian became a major hurricane off the coastline of Mexico, a tropical storm watch was issued by the National Weather Service of Mexico along the coast of southwestern Mexico spanning from Acapulco to Punta San Telmo. The tropical storm watch was in effect at 1500 UTC on June 8 and discontinued at 0300 UTC on June 9\\\\. Despite these watches, no tropical storm force winds were observed on the coast of Mexico. The National Weather Service of Mexico also issued heavy rain alerts for Colima, Michoac√°n and Guerrero. The Mexican civil defense system declared a green alert (low risk) for these three states. In addition, a blue alert (minimal risk) was issued for coast of Nayarit and Oaxaca. Across the southwestern Mexican coastline, Adrian sent waves up to high, generating swells and rough seas. Plumes of moisture from the outer rainbands of Adrian caused heavy rain in the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoac√°n. As much as of precipitation was recorded at Lake Chapala in a 24-hour period. Similarly, a weather station at Tequisistl√°n, Oaxaca recorded of rainfall accumulation. Ships traveling within the vicinity of Adrian were advised to take extreme caution as Adrian paralleled the Mexican coastline. Overall, Adrian had limited effects on land since it stayed in the open Pacific waters, thus there were no reports of notable damage or casualties as a result of Adrian.

A funerary cult is a body of religious teaching and practice centered on the veneration of the dead, in which the living are thought to be able to confer benefits on the dead in the afterlife or to appease their otherwise wrathful ghosts. Rituals were carried on for the benefit of the dead, either by their relatives or by a class of priests appointed and paid to perform the rites. These rituals took place at the tombs of the dead themselves or at mortuary temples appointed to this purpose. Funerary cults are found in a wide variety of cultures.Yayoi Shirai, \\"Ideal and reality in Old Kingdom private funerary cults\\", in The Old Kingdom Art and Archaeology, Miroslav B√°rta, ed.; (Czech Institute of Egyptology, 2004), pp. 325 et. seq., accessed June 8, 2011 Notable cults =Egypt= Funerary cults are especially associated with ancient Egypt, where it was common for royalty, those associated with royalty, cats, and the wealthy to be mummified. This practice was done so as to preserve their bodies for the journey to the afterlife. The deity Osiris, who was the dying and reviving god and Lord of the Egyptian afterlife, was usually depicted as a mummy in Egyptian art. Also at Bubastis, where Bast was worshiped, there was a massive cat cemetery. Cats were also thought to journey to the afterlife, usually to join their owners. These needed their own material goods for this journey, such as food.(p50 1910 encyclopedia Britannica) =Roman Empire= The Roman Empire also had a funerary cult, revolving around Dionysus. Dionysus, (along with being lord of wine and parties) had been reborn many times and had rescued his mother Semele from the Underworld (the Roman afterlife, ruled by Hades). Each Roman God had his or her own clique of devotees, and it was thought that Dionysus could protect his initiates from death. He was also one of the Gods associated with plants (grapes in particular) and harvest. He was occasionally depicted in conjunction with other Gods (representatives of rebirth or plants of some kind) to indicate the dead also participated in the rejuvenation of the seasons.(The cults of the Roman Empire By Robert Turcan, p 312-313) =Mesopotamia= In Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia, funerary cults were called kispu. This funerary cult mostly revolved around caring for deceased kin, with a specific family member assigned to providing for a specific ghost. The ghosts were provided with food and other goods, however the provision of clean water was of particular importance. Both deceased men and women were supposed to receive this care. Without this care, the dead had the potential to become a malicious supernatural force. With this care, the dead family continue to participate in the lives of the living family. Also, the practice of recycling the names of the deceased allowed for familial continuity. In Assyria, this was done by any consanguineal kin. A Babylonian variation of this cult treats the veneration of the dead as an extension of the veneration for parents. Offspring were responsible for this care. Scholar Miranda Bayliss had stated the function of this cult was to alleviate guilt and other tensions from the death of the deceased and form solidarity and continuity within the family. Typically only close kin received this care. When ancestors beyond the individual's grandparents were venerated, it was done at large gatherings of extended kin groups. This also functioned to promote solidarity within the larger kin group.Miranda Bayliss, \\"The Cult of Dead Kin in Assyria and Babylonia\\", Iraq, v. 35, no. 2. seq.Bram Jagersma, \\"The Calendar of the Funerary Cult in Ancient Lagash\\", Bibliotheca Orientalis, v.: 64 nos: 3-4, pp 289-307 =Greece= The ancient Greek hero cult was also a funerary cult; in the original sense, a hero was a deified or semi-divine ancestor, worshiped at a shrine for his power to assist the living. The ancient Greek religion had three main aspects: the Gods, the heroes, and the dead. The dead are powerless and the Gods all-powerful, while the heroes are dead (live only in legend and memory) and are powerful. Heroes occupy a liminal space between the Gods and mortals. Mortals sacrificed livestock and plants at Heroes' tombs to intervene and commune with the Gods on their behalf.A companion to Greek Religion, by Daniel Ogden, p113-4 =Italian Peninsula= The Samnites and Etruscans of the Italian peninsula painted the underworld deities Aita, Vanth, Phersipnei, and Letham on the walls of tombs.G.

The conference was briefly (2002-2015) associated with the newly formed Mennonite Church USA (MC USA) Organization The churches of the Lancaster Mennonite Conference (LMC) make up 26 districts including: Bowmansville-Reading, Elizabethtown, Ephrata, Groffdale, Harrisburg, Juniata, Lancaster, Landisville, Lebanon, Lititz, Manheim, Manor, Martindale, Mellinger, Millwood, New Danville, New York City, North Penn, Pequea Valley, Philadelphia, Spanish, Washington-Baltimore, Weaverland-Northeast Pennsylvania, Williamsport-Milton, Willow Street-Strasburg, and York-Adams Districts. The conference office is located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Bishop Board, a collection of all the bishops from the districts in the Conference, is the executive board of the Lancaster Mennonite Conference. The Conference Leadership Assembly, composed of all bishops, ministers, deacons, deaconesses, and chaplains in the Conference, is the governing body of Lancaster Mennonite Conference. Lancaster Mennonite Conference publishes a magazine Shalom News, and oversees several agencies, including Eastern Mennonite Missions, Friendship Community, Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society, Lancaster Mennonite School, Landis Homes, Philhaven, and Sharing Programs. History The Lancaster Mennonite Conference first convened in 1711, only a few months after the Swiss-Palatine immigrants had established themselves in what is now Lancaster County. In 1725, five representatives, Martin Baer, Hans Burkholtzer, Christian Herr, Benedikt Hirsche, and Johannes Bowman, attended the first general Mennonite Conference when the Dordrecht Confession was translated into English. Additional Mennonite immigrants joined the settlement in 1711, 1717, 1727, and at later periods. It is estimated that by 1735 over five hundred families had emigrated from Switzerland and the Palatinate and settled in Lancaster County. They overflowed into what are now neighboring counties and established daughter colonies in Maryland, Virginia, New York, Canada, and Ohio. The Mellinger meetinghouse was home to semiannual conferences each fall and at one of the three Rohrerstown meetinghouses every spring as far back as records exist, around 1740. But beginning in 1953, the spring meeting was moved to East Petersburg Mennonite Church. It was at this conference that decisions were made and either approved or rejected. Expansion and growth led to differences of opinion within the conference. In 1960, nine ordained men withdrew from the conference to form the Mennonite Christian Brotherhood. Differences over issues related to divorce and remarriage, television, and relaxed dress requirements resulted in the formation of the Eastern Pennsylvania Mennonite Church in 1969. Two hundred members left in 1975 to formed the Conservative Mennonite Churches of York and Adams Counties, Pennsylvania. = Affiliations = In 1971, after repeated invitations, the Lancaster Mennonite Conference joined the Mennonite Church (MC), sometimes known as the \\"Old\\" Mennonite Church. The conference reorganized to more closely follow the structure of the Mennonite Church in 1977. After five years of provisional membership, Lancaster Mennonite Conference joined Mennonite Church USA (MC USA) as a full member in 2006. MC USA was a merger of the (Old) Mennonite Church and the General Conference Mennonite Church, which occurred in 2001. On November 19, 2015, citing a \\"cultural and theological divide\\" over same-sex marriage and LGBTQ relationships, a proposal by the Board of Bishops to leave MC USA was ratified by 82.3% of those voting. The withdrawal was effective immediately and to be finalized by congregations on or before the end of 2017, but allowed individual congregations an option of continued participation with MC USA, if so desired. At the time, the conference had 13,838 members in 163 congregations. Most congregations opted to exit the Mennonite Church USA, leaving only 1,091 members from Lancaster Mennonite Conference remaining with the MC USA. = Ordination of women = Lancaster Mennonite Conference leaves it to the member congregations whether or not to ordain women, but reserves oversight roles and bishoprics to men.

Arunma Oteh became Director General of the SEC in January 2010, after being confirmed by the Senate. In a June 2010 interview with the BBC Oteh listed \\"wash sales, market rigging, pumping and dumping shares\\" as some of the abuses in Nigeria's capital market. She said the SEC expected to charge about 200 individuals and entities in civil or criminal cases. She faced resistance from the powerful Nigerian rent-seeking elite, but expressed confidence due to the backing she had received from President Goodluck Jonathan. In August 2010, as a result of some of the identified market abuse issues, the Securities and Exchange Commission removed the leadership of the Nigerian stock exchange. The House Committee of Capital Markets and Institutions launched a public inquiry in April 2012 into the near collapse of the Nigerian capital market in 2008. Oteh and the committee chairman had a heated exchange over the focus of the hearing, leading to the chairmans resignation from the committee after allegations that he had asked for a bribe to influence the House Committee inquiry, and that he had collected public funds to attend a workshop in the Dominican Republic but had neither attended the program nor returned the money The SEC released two statements explaining their position on the allegations made during the public hearing. The First press statement made on 19 March 2012 focused on the varied allegations made by the committee In June 2012. The second press statement stated that \\"[n]o financial overtures have ever been made to the Hon.

The film is a baseball-styled sports film centering on Babe Ruth and Anna Q. Nilsson. The film was released in the short-lived Vocafilm sound-on-film process, presumably a music and effects soundtrack but no dialogue. The film is considered a lost film. Synopsis Babe Dugan, star player of the Angel baseball team, chews tobacco and gets his uniform dirtier than any other player. Vernie, the laundress who cleans his uniform every week, becomes concerned over his untidiness; Babe calls to apologize for unintentionally striking her with a ball during a game; and his pal, Peewee, falls in love with Vernie's friend, Georgia. On an outing to an amusement park, a roller coaster throws Vernie into Babe's arms; soon they are engaged, and Vernie plans to reform him. Scores of tobacco cubes and spittoons are pre-wedding gifts, and they precipitate a lovers' quarrel. But Babe takes the reform idea seriously, though his game slumps and he is put on the bench. At a crucial moment, Vernie relents and throws him a plug of tobacco; and consequently he delivers a four-base blow. Cast *Babe Ruth - 'Babe' Dugan *Anna Q.

The house was designed by architect Roscoe Hememway. The landscape architecture was designed by John Alexander Grant. The property included a rose garden. with The listing for the William B.

This appears to indicate that the 6347 property has been split, and the original .75 acre property is no longer intact. Further the middle initial appears to indicate a typo; the listing would have made sense as a boundary decrease to the William B. Holden House listing.By Google Maps' Streetview, with photography dating from June 2016, the next residence is a modern residence at 6359 SE Yamhill. In between the William B. Holden House and the 6359 property, there appears to be space adequate for another house to be inserted. In November 2016, the Multnomah County assessor's office map system shows parcel with address 6353 running between the 6347 and 6359 properties. The 6347 property is wrapped on three sides by SE Yamhill, which ascends in the rear (west edge) of the property, turns around the south side, and comes across the front (east side) of the property. The 6353 property adjoins the 6347 property with its rear (west) and its front (east) both on SE Yamhill.

Hill, who learned the book-binding trade through an apprenticeship. In 1901, the company's main offerings were children's novels authored by L. Frank Baum. It sold Dot and Tot of Merryland and American Fairy Tales and also acquired the right to republish Mother Goose in Prose in \\"popular-priced form\\". The company also published a reprint of the 1847 edition of Webster's Dictionary, which was out of copyright. In 1902, it purchased the right from the G. & C. Merriam Company (now called Merriam-Webster) to publish the 1864 unabridged edition of the dictionary with an additional 10,000 words from the 1879 version. Compelled to declare bankruptcy in March 1902, the company had, a few weeks earlier, decided to enlarge its operations and erect a new building. On April 26, Robert O. Law was selected by the court to be the interim trustee. Law authorized the selling of George M. Hill Company's property. On March 29, Publishers Weekly reported the sale of hundreds of plates and juvenile books, including books that had yet to be published and Baum's works. Despite Hill's attempts to repossess his company, the George W. Ogilvie Company was established on May 8 to manage its holdings. Having purchased Hill's manufacturing plant, C. O. Owen & Co. resold it to the Hill Bindery Company, which was newly created and managed by George Hill. Father Goose and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz 1901 poster from Hill advertising books by L. Frank Baum L. Frank Baum and W. W. Denslow wanted to publish Father Goose in color. Because few publishers would spend the money to have the book's illustrations done as they desired, they searched for a company to manufacture the book. Denslow had previous involvement with George M. Hill Company. He and Baum brought the drafts of their novel to Hill in the hopes that the company would makes samples for them. Hill not only complied, but he also promised to publish it if Baum and Denslow paid for the color plates. The book's initial printing was 5,700 copies which rapidly sold out. Subsequent printings were also immediately sold out, and Father Goose came to be the bestselling picture book in 1900. In 1900, Hill also published The Songs of Father Goose, a compilation of black-and-white pages from the original book that was complemented by music from Albert N. Hall. 1900 poster advertising The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Hill gave Baum and Denslow a $1,000 advance to be shared equally on The Emerald City. Later the title was later changed to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In their contract, every time the book was sold at the suggested retail price of $1.50, the author and illustrator would each receive a royalty of nine cents. The contract also gave Hill \\"the exclusive right of publication of any books or literary works which they may jointly produce, write or illustrate, during a period of five years from the date of the agreement\\". That portion of the contract was later dissolved by agreement of all parties because Hill failed to fulfill another part of the contract. Though Hill pledged to publish the book in England, Baum later said it was \\"never done.\\" See also * Books in the United States References ;Notes ;Footnotes ;Bibliography * External links Category:Defunct publishing companies of the United States Category:Publishing companies established in 1893 Category:1893 establishments in Illinois Category:American companies established in 1893 ","title":"George M.

The plan was passed by the Minnesota House of Representatives on May 13 and the Minnesota Senate on May 18, but was vetoed by Democratic Governor Mark Dayton on May 19. In February 2012, a state court panel redrew Minnesota's congressional boundaries with the effect of enacting a \\"least-change\\" map. District 1 Democrat Tim Walz, who has represented Minnesota's 1st congressional district since 2007, sought re-election. In redistricting, Murray County, Pipestone County and half of Cottonwood County were moved from the 1st district to the 7th and Wabasha County was moved from the 1st district to the 2nd; while Le Sueur County and most of Rice County were moved from the 2nd district to the 1st. The 1st district was expected to continue to slightly favor Republicans. State senator Mike Parry lost the GOP nomination to state representative Allen Quist. State senator Julie Rosen did not seek the Republican nomination. Former state representative Randy Demmer, who unsuccessfully challenged Walz as the Republican nominee in 2010, and state representative Steve Drazkowski did not run. Walz handily dispatched Quist in the election, garnering 58% of the vote. =Democratic primary= Candidates * Tim Walz, incumbent U.S. Representative since 2007 Results =Republican primary= Candidates * Mike Parry, State Senator from senate district 26 since 2010 * Allen Quist, former State Representative from legislative district 23B (1983-1989) Results =General election= Results District 2 Republican John Kline, who has represented Minnesota's 2nd congressional district since 2003, sought re-election. Patrick Ganey, a member of the Northfield City Council; Kathleen Gaylord, a member of the Dakota County Commission; former state Representative Mike Obermueller; and Dan Powers, a former small business owner who unsuccessfully sought the DFL nomination in the 2nd district in 2010, sought the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination to challenge Kline. At the congressional district convention, the party endorsed Mike Obermueller. In redistricting, Le Sueur County and Rice County were moved from the 2nd district to the 1st and Carver County was moved from the 2nd district to the 3rd and 6th; while West St. Paul and parts of South St. Paul were moved from the 4th district to the 2nd.

In the third district Democratic convention, Barnes won the party endorsement and Sund backed his candidacy. Sund was subsequently elected Chair of the Hennepin County Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. In redistricting, the 3rd district was expanded to include eastern Carver County, while part of the northeastern Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metro area was moved to the 5th. The district was made more favorable to Republicans. Paulsen received 58% of the vote, defeating Barnes who received 42%. =Democratic primary= Candidates * Brian Barnes, businessman Results =Republican primary= Candidates * John W.

In redistricting, the 4th district was made slightly more favorable to Republicans, but continues to strongly favor Democrats. Dan Flood, a retired Navy officer, and Tony Hernandez, a businessman who had been running for the U.S. Senate, sought the Republican nomination to challenge McCollum. Hernandez won the Republican primary and will face McCollum on the November ballot. The home of Republican U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, who has represented Minnesota's 6th congressional district since 2007, was drawn into the 4th district in redistricting; however Bachmann sought re-election in the 6th district. McCollum retained her seat, defeating Hernandez. =Democratic primary= Candidates * Diana Longrie, former Mayor of Maplewood (2005-2009) * Betty McCollum, incumbent U.S. Representative since 2001 * Brian Stalboerger Results =Republican primary= Candidates * Tony Hernandez * Ron Seiford Results =Independence primary= Candidates * Steve Carlson Results =General election= Results District 5 Minnesota's 5th congressional district has been represented by Democrat Keith Ellison since 2007.

Ron Seiford, an adjunct business instructor at Woodbury's Globe College, and Aubrey Immelman unsuccessfully challenged her in the Republican nomination, though Bachmann won by the lowest margin of any incumbent Republican congressional candidate in 50 years. Jim Graves, a hotel executive, won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination at the party's convention in April 2012. He defeated Brian McGoldrick, a businessman; Anne Nolan, an attorney and business consultant, and Mike Starr, a substitute schoolteacher. In redistricting, the 6th district was expanded to include Carver County and was made more favorable to Republicans. Despite this, Bachmann narrowly retained the seat, receiving 4298 more votes than Graves. =Democratic primary= Candidates * Jim Graves, hotel executive Results =Republican primary= Candidates * Michele Bachmann, incumbent U.S. Representative since 2007 * Aubrey Immelman * Stephen Thompson Results =General election= Results District 7 Democrat Collin Peterson, who has represented Minnesota's 7th congressional district since 1991, sought re- election. In redistricting, the 7th district was expanded to include rural counties in southern Minnesota, while cities were moved from the 6th and 8th districts into the 7th. Lee Byberg, a business executive who unsuccessfully challenged Peterson as the Republican nominee in 2010; and state senator Gretchen Hoffman, sought the Republican nomination to challenge Peterson. Byberg again received the Republican Party's nomination and was defeated by Peterson. No primary elections were held in the 7th district in 2012. =General election= Results District 8 Republican Chip Cravaack, who was first elected to represent Minnesota's 8th congressional district in 2010, sought re-election. Former U.S. Representative Rick Nolan won the DFL primary on August 14, defeating Jeff Anderson, a member of the Duluth City Council, and Tarryl Clark, a member of the Minnesota Senate who unsuccessfully ran against Michele Bachmann in the 6th district in 2010. Daniel Fanning, the former deputy state director for Senator Al Franken, had decided to run, but ended his campaign in January 2012. State senate minority leader Tom Bakk, Duluth mayor Don Ness, state senator Roger Reinert, state representative Tom Rukavina, former state house majority leader Tony Sertich, and lieutenant governor Yvonne Prettner Solon, all of whom are Democrats, did not run. State representative Carly Melin had said she was \\"keeping an open mind\\" regarding the possibility of seeking the Democratic nomination; however, she later endorsed Anderson's campaign. Nolan was earlier victorious in a February 2012 caucus, receiving 1,537 votes to Anderson's 1,008 and Clark's 408. 269 uncommitted votes were cast. Delegates to a convention held in May 2012 could endorse one candidate, but candidates who did not receive the party's endorsement were nonetheless able to run in the August 2012 primary. Nolan won the DFL primary in August, with 38.3% of the vote, against Clark's 32.3% and Anderson's 29.5% In redistricting, the 8th district was not significantly changed and remained competitive. Nolan triumphed over Cravaack, receiving about 55% of the vote. =Democratic primary= Candidates * Jeff Anderson, former Duluth City Councilor (2007-2011) * Tarryl L.

The salvo combat model provides a mathematical representation of anti-ship missile battles between modern warships. It was developed by Wayne Hughes at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.Hughes WP. 1995. A salvo model of warships in missile combat used to evaluate their staying power. Naval Research Logistics 42 (2) 267-289. The salvo model describes the basic elements of modern missile combat in a very simple manner. This is similar to how Lanchester's Square Law provides a simple model of modern gun combat.Taylor JG. 1983. Lanchester Models of Warfare, volumes I & II. Operations Research Society of America.  The model's structure  = Basic form = Suppose that two naval forces, Red and Blue, are engaging each other in combat. The battle begins with Red firing a salvo of missiles at Blue. The Blue ships try to shoot down those incoming missiles. Simultaneously, Blue launches a salvo that Red tries to intercept. This exchange of missile fire can be modeled as follows. Let symbol A represent the number of combat units (warships or other weapon platforms) in the Red force at the beginning of the battle. Each one has offensive firepower Œ±, which is the number of offensive missiles accurately fired per salvo at the enemy. Each one also has defensive firepower y, which is the number of incoming enemy missiles intercepted per salvo by its active defenses. Each ship has staying power w, which is the number of enemy missile hits required to put it out of action. Equivalently, one could say that each attacking missile can cause damage equal to a fraction u=1/w of a Red ship. The Blue force is represented in a similar manner. Blue has B units, each with offensive firepower Œ≤, defensive firepower z, and staying power x. Each missile that hits will cause damage v=1/x. The salvo combat model calculates the number of ships lost on each side using the following pair of equations. Here, ŒîA represents the change in the number of Red's ships from one salvo, while ŒîB represents the change in the number of Blue ships. :ŒîA = -(Œ≤B - yA)u, subject to 0 ‚â§ -ŒîA ‚â§ A :ŒîB = -(Œ±A - zB)v, subject to 0 ‚â§ -ŒîB ‚â§ B Each equation starts by calculating the total number of offensive missiles being launched by the attacker. It then subtracts the total number of interceptions by the defender. The number of remaining (non-intercepted) offensive missiles is multiplied by the amount of damage caused per missile to get the total amount of damage. If there are more defensive interceptions than offensive missiles, then the total damage is zero; it cannot be negative. These equations assume that each side is using aimed fire; that is, a force knows the location of its target and can aim its missiles at it. If however a force knows only the approximate location of its target (e.g., somewhere within a fog bank), then it may spread its fire across a wide area, with the hope that at least some of its missiles will find the target. A different version of the salvo equations is required for such area fire.Armstrong MJ, 2014. ‚ÄúThe salvo combat model with area fire‚Äù. Naval Research Logistics. Mathematically, the salvo equations can be thought of as difference equations or recurrence relations. They are also an example of operations research. A stochastic (or probabilistic) version of the model also exists.Armstrong MJ, 2005, A stochastic salvo model for naval surface combat, Operations Research 53, #5, 830-841. In this version, the ship parameters listed above are random variables instead of constants. This means that the result of each salvo also varies randomly. The stochastic model can be incorporated into a computer spreadsheet and used instead of the Monte Carlo method of computer simulation.Armstrong MJ, 2011, A verification study of the stochastic salvo combat model, Annals of Operations Research 186, #1, 23-38. An alternative version of this model exists for situations where one side attacks first, and then the survivors (if any) on the other side counter-attack,Armstrong MJ, 2014. The salvo combat model with a sequential exchange of fire. Journal of the Operational Research Society. such as at the Battle of Midway. = Relation to Lanchester's laws = The U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers is designed for missile combat. The salvo equations are related to Lanchester's Square Law equations, with two main differences. First, the basic salvo equations form a discrete time model, whereas Lanchester's original equations form a continuous time model. Cruise missiles typically are fired in relatively small quantities. Each one has a high probability of hitting its target, if not intercepted, and carries a relatively powerful warhead. Therefore, it makes sense to model them as a discrete pulse (or salvo) of firepower. By comparison, bullets or shells in a gun battle are typically fired in large quantities. Each round has a relatively low chance of hitting its target, and does a relatively small amount of damage. Therefore, it makes sense to model them as a small but continuous stream of firepower. Second, the salvo equations include defensive firepower, whereas Lanchester's original equations include only offensive firepower. Cruise missiles can be intercepted (shot down) by active defenses, such as surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns. By comparison, it is generally not practical to intercept bullets and shells during a gun battle.  Applications of the model  = Types of warfare = The salvo model primarily represents naval missile battles, such as those that occurred during the Falklands War. Offensive firepower represents anti-ship cruise missiles such as the Harpoon, the Exocet and the Styx. Defensive firepower represents air defense missiles such as the Standard, as well as anti-aircraft guns such as the Phalanx. However, one can adapt the model to other kinds of battles having similar characteristics. For example, some authors have used it study World War II battles between aircraft carriers,Hughes WP, 2000, Fleet tactics and coastal combat, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis. such as the Battle of the Coral Sea.Armstrong MJ, Powell MB, 2005, A salvo combat analysis of the Battle of the Coral Sea, Military Operations Research 10 #4, 27-38. In this case, the offensive firepower consists of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. The defensive firepower consists of fighter aircraft that try to intercept those bombers. The model could instead describe battles where torpedoes are the main form of offensive firepower, such as in the Battle of Savo Island. In this case, the defensive firepower would be zero, since so far there is no effective way to actively intercept torpedoes. A simplified version of the model was used to study alternative outcomes of the Charge of the Light Brigade by British cavalry against Russian cannon in 1854.Connors D, Armstrong MJ, Bonnett J, 2015, A counterfactual study of the Charge of the Light Brigade, Historical Methods: A Journal of Quantitative and Interdisciplinary History 48 #2, 80-89. The model has also been modified to represent tactical ballistic missile defense. This variant was used to analyze the performance of the Iron Dome missile defense system during 2012's Operation Pillar of Defense.Armstrong MJ, 2014, Modeling short-range ballistic missile defense and Israel's Iron Dome system, Operations Research 62 #5, 1028-1039. = Development of tactics = Type 022 Houbei-class missile boats are small and fast. The salvo combat model can help with research on a variety of issues in naval warfare.Xu Xiaoming, Ren Yaofeng, Feng Wei, 2010, Analysis of Warfare Loss of the Surface Missile Combat Based on Salvo Model, Ship Electronic Engineering 30 (9). For example, one study examined the value of having accurate information about an enemy fleet.Lucas TW, McGunnigle JE, 2003, When is model complexity too much? Illustrating the benefits of simple models with Hughes' salvo equations, Naval Research Logistics 50 #3, 197-217. Another study examined how many missiles would be required to achieve a desired probability of success when attacking several targets at once.Armstrong MJ, 2007, Effective attacks in the salvo combat model: salvo sizes and quantities of targets, Naval Research Logistics 54 #1, 66-77. Researchers have also analyzed the mathematical properties of the model itself.Armstrong MJ. 2004. Effects of lethality on naval combat models. Naval Research Logistics 51 #1, 28-43. The initial goal of such research is to get a better understanding of how the model works. A more important objective is to see what the model might suggest about the behavior of real missile battles. This could help with the development of better modern naval tactics for attacking with and defending against such missiles.  References   Further reading  * Weapons Analysis LLC (2012).

Construction began in 1886 and was completed in 1890. The building has been called \\"one of the finest examples\\" of High Victorian Gothic architecture in the state of Oregon. It includes stained-glass windows made by Portland's Povey Brothers Art Glass Works and a church bell cast with bronze from captured Civil War cannons. Congregation history As a congregation, what is now known as the First Presbyterian Church of Portland was organized on January 1, 1854, and was only the third Presbyterian church in the Oregon Territory. With a congregation numbering just twelve members initially, services were originally held in private homes, twice a month. For the first year, Reverend J. L. Yantis journeyed on horseback to Portland from Calapooia, Oregon (2 miles east of Shedd), 80 miles to the south. Services were later held at a larger venue, the Canton House‚Äîa public meeting place at Front and Washington streets that was later known as the Pioneer Hotel, the Lincoln House and the American Exchange building. By 1860, the congregation had grown to 87 members, and fundraising for a permanent church building began. Property was purchased in 1862. The congregation's first permanent building was completed in 1864, at 3rd and Washington streets, and was dedicated on May 22. It included the first pipe organ in Portland. A 1,052-pound bell was donated by Caroline E. Jagger Corbett, wife of Senator Henry W. Corbett. It was made by Meneely & Company (of Troy, New York) from bronze Civil War cannons. A 1987 article in The Oregonian said that in 1865, the bell \\"rang out the news that the Civil War had ended. Five days later, it tolled for President Lincoln's death.\\" The church society was incorporated as \\"the First Presbyterian Church and Society of the City of Portland\\" in 1865, by members William S. Ladd, John C. Ainsworth, O.P.S. Plummer and others. As the congregation continued to grow, First Presbyterian counted many prominent Portlanders among its members, including Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, John C. Ainsworth, and Jacob Kamm. By the 1880s the congregation had grown to 900 members, and it was decided that a new, larger building was needed. In 1883, a parcel of more than a quarter-block was purchased at 12th and Alder streets for the new church, and later an adjacent property at 13th and Alder was purchased for a parsonage. Architect William F. McCaw was hired to design the new building, and his plans were approved in July 1886. According to The Oregon Encyclopedia, in the 1920s First Presbyterian Church was \\"among the ten largest [Presbyterian] congregations in the United States.\\" In 1929, membership stood at 2,802. In 1997, there were 1,100 members. Building Viewed from the east-northeast, intersection of 12th & Alder, in 2017 Construction of the existing building began in 1886. The general contractor was John C. Robertson. By May 1887, the foundation had been completed, and the cornerstone was laid in a ceremony on May 2 of that year. The chapel was finished in May 1889, in the new building's west end, and services began being held there as work continued on the main auditorium. Construction of the latter was completed in 1890, and the first public worship service in the new building's main auditorium was held on October 20, 1890. The total construction cost was approximately $120,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The church bell from the 1864 building was moved to the new building in 1889 or 1890. It remains in regular use today, being rung twice a day. A 1987 article gave its weight as . The city council designated the church building a Portland Historic Landmark on April 8, 1970, and the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. =Description= Designed in High Victorian Gothic style, the First Presbyterian Church occupies an site and includes a spire. (Some sources give the spire's height as 180 feet.) The steeple's roof was originally covered in slate shingles, but copper cladding replaced the shingles in 1929, and a new coating of copper replaced the original in 1982. Exterior Arched entrance doorway at the southeast corner, facing 12th Avenue The building's stone exterior is made of rusticated black basalt with lighter sandstone trim. The main portion of the building is a gable-roofed auditorium (sanctuary), the main access to which is via a narthex. There are three entrances to the narthex. Two include an arched doorway topped by a pediment, with a trio of stained-glass windows (and smaller, accent windows) above the large wooden doors. One of these entrances faces Alder Street at the base of the tower, at the building's northeast corner. The other, at the building's southeast corner (the opposite end of the narthex), faces 12th Avenue. The third narthex entrance is on the south side of the building and is fitted with a porte-coch√®re. An additional entrance on the building's north side is located immediately west of the sanctuary and east of the chapel, and is positioned about mid-block on Alder Street. As with the other two original entrances, it has an arched and pedimented doorway with stained-glass windows above the doors. The sanctuary doors are decorated with ornamental brass overlay and leather, and the principle exterior entrance doors feature decorative brass hinges. Positioned on each side of the main auditorium's gabled roof are two gabled dormers, each with a \\"rose-like\\" stained-glass window. A \\"dormer-like\\" pavilion (without entrance) is centered in the narthex, below the great window‚Äîthe church's largest stained-glass window, in the east end of the auditorium. At the building's west end is a chapel with a transverse gable roof (set at a right angle to the main roof and auditorium), with an arched tracery rose window of stained glass at the south end, where the pulpit is located. At the time of its completion, its floor area was . At its north end, on Alder Street, it has a twin-door entrance, with a narrow sandstone arch above each single door. Interior View of sanctuary from its balcony, with the pulpit in the center and pipe organ in the upper background The main auditorium is in size, with a ceiling. The balcony and its stairways were added in 1892. It wraps around three sides of the sanctuary and has an undulating curve in the center, at the rear (east end) of the sanctuary. The church's interior is \\"richly embellished\\". The auditorium features extensive use of cherrywood, carved by Nicholas Strahan, for the \\"chancel, choir loft, and organ\\", as well as for \\"the pulpit, pews, ornamentation, and balcony railings\\". Strahan was from Portland, but had learned his craft in England. The carvings feature Gothic motifs. The pews are laid-out in a semi-circle. The 57-foot-high ceiling is topped by a timber roof that has \\"arched braces, hammerbeams, kingposts, tie beams, purlins and rafters, all carved and ornamented, and, like the rest of the woodwork, in a natural finish,\\" as described in the building's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The church's many stained-glass windows were designed by David Povey of Povey Brothers Art Glass Works, of Portland. There are stained-glass windows above every entrance, lining both sides of the sanctuary, lining the narthex, and in the four roof dormers. The dominant, largest window is at the rear of the sanctuary (its east end) and \\"contains a cross made of chunks of split and fractured glass, with a white dove descending on the cross.\\" Most other windows display biblical fruit and flower motifs. The separate chapel also has Povey windows, including a large rose window at its south end. Most other windows in the chapel are now covered up, those along the west wall by the erection, in 1912, of the three-story ancillary building immediately west of the 1890 building, and those along the south wall as a result of a remodeling of the chapel's interior in 1954. The current pipe organ is a 52-rank Jaeckel organ dating from 2000. It replaced a Moller organ that had been installed in 1929. The building's original organ was one transferred from the 1864 building at 3rd and Washington streets.

In the foreground is the plaza that was created atop an underground parking garage built in 2006. The parsonage at the southeast corner of 13th Avenue and Alder Street, immediately west of the main building, was demolished and replaced in 1911‚Äì1912 by a 3¬Ω-story, Tudor-style church hall that houses the church's administrative offices, rooms for Sunday school classes and various other facilities. The church complex now occupies the entire city block, bounded by 12th and 13th avenues and Alder and Morrison Streets, but this was not the case before 2006. Since 1924, the Danmoore Hotel building had stood in the southeast quadrant of the block, directly abutting the porte-coch√®re at the church's southernmost entrance, but it was demolished in 2005 to make way for an underground parking garage. In 1988, the 118-room apartment hotel and property, which had been acquired by the some of the church's members, was donated to the church, under long-term plans to relocate its residents to replacement housing (known as the Alder House apartments) located kitty-corner from the main church property, and redevelop the site. Following a 2001-launched fundraising campaign among members, plans for the redevelopment came together. The Danmoore's residents were relocated, the building was razed, and a three-story underground parking garage was built in the space, being completed in March 2006. A landscaped plaza designed by Hennebery Eddy Architects was created on top of the parking garage, at street level, and opened at the same time.

The bench comprised Chief Justice Rabie and Judges of Appeal Corbett, Hoexter, Botha and Van Heerden, who found that, when a person is kept alive artificially by means of respirator, its eventual disconnection is not in legal terms the act which causes death; it merely constitutes the termination of a fruitless attempt to avert the consequences of the wounding. The causal connection between the wounding and the eventual death exists from beginning to end, in other words; it is not interrupted by the disconnection of the respirator. The court avoided the question of whether or not brain death, in line with medical science, should amount to legal death.  Facts  The accused had broken into the home of the deceased with the intention of robbing her. On entering her bedroom, he shot her in the neck. She was still breathing on her admission to hospital. Two days later, her doctors declared that she showed no sign of brain activity. The brainstem had ceased to function; she was effectively dead. Two days further, after thorough neurologic scrutiny, the ventilator was disconnected, and after ten minutes she registered no heart activity.  Judgment  Facing a charge of murder, the accused argued that the cause of death had not been the discharge of lead into the deceased's neck, but rather the disconnection of the ventilator: a novus actus interveniens. It was the doctor, in other words, who ought to be held liable for her death. Both the trial court (the Cape Provincial Division) and the Appellate Division rejected this defence. The trial court held that the moment of death occurred when the brain ceased to function, so she would have been long dead when the doctor disconnected the ventilator. The Appellate Division found that it was unnecessary to decide on the legal propriety of this view (which was the one held by medical science), and resolved the matter instead on the basis of the \\"traditional view of the community,\\" which is that one is dead when one stops breathing and one's heart stops beating. The court emphasised that its silence on the issue of brain death should not be taken to be an indication that the approach of the trial court ought to be accepted. The question then was left open, and there remains to this day no general legal definition of death in South African law. What was clear was that, where a person is so seriously wounded that he would, in the absence of prompt medical intervention, very soon be dead, and is kept alive artificially by means of a respirator, the eventual disconnection of the respirator could not be seen as the act which caused the death. It was merely the termination of a fruitless attempt to save a life: that is, to avert the consequences of the wounding. The causal connection between the wounding of the deceased and his eventual death exists from beginning to end, and is not interrupted and eliminated by the disconnection of the respirator.

It was a center within Harvard University, United States. Foundation and leadership The Harvard Institute for International Development originated when Harvard University's Center for International Affairs (CFIA) tried to move away from a controversial role in giving advice on topics such as arms control, foreign aid and development. The CFIA preferred a more academic role of teaching and research. The Ford Foundation and other organizations involved in aid-giving still wanted Harvard to provide hands-on training for their staff. In 1962 the Development Advisory Service was established for this purpose, associated with the CFIA but independent. It was renamed the HIID in 1974. In 1980 the economist Arnold Harberger of the Harvard University was selected as head of the institute. The announcement met with protests from students and staff since Harberger had previously advised the Augusto Pinochet military regime in Chile. He withdrew and Dwight Perkins, an economist and specialist in China, took the job. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economist Jeffrey Sachs became head of the institute. Development programs The HIID became the umbrella organization for overseas aid and development programs led by the university but funded by the government or foundations. The HIID coordinated development assistance, training, and research on Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America. The Institute helped developing nations to achieve economic growth and improve their people's welfare. The institute provided staff for various development projects. For example, in the late 1970s David Korten headed a project funded by the Ford Foundation to assist in organization and management of national family-planning programs. In 1991 the HIID launched a program called WorldTeach that sent college student and graduates to schools in developing countries for a one-year assignment. Countries that had requested volunteers were Costa Rica, Ecuador, Namibia, South Africa, Poland, Thailand and China. Research Littauer Building, John F. Kennedy School of Government, home of the HIID The HIID undertook many research projects related to international development. For example, in the early 1980s, the HIID undertook a study of several of Indonesia's national development programs, including grants for village development, schools, family planning and rice yield improvement programs. The programs had been running for some time, but the study uncovered a number of anomalies that were affecting their efficiency. The HIID collaborated with the Women In Development office of USAID in developing the Harvard Analytical Framework, also called the Gender Roles Framework, one of the earliest frameworks for understanding differences between men and women in their participation in the economy. This has great importance in helping policy makers understand the economic case for allocating resources to women as well as men. The framework was described in 1984. In 1987, the International Tropical Timber Organization commissioned HIID to prepare a review of current knowledge of multiple-use management of tropical hardwood forests. Of interest was the potential for non-timber products and services that could assist in sustaining the forests. HIID completed the study in 1988 and issued updated versions in 1990 and 1992. Research published in 1989 described the effects of price controls in emerging economies in creating parallel or black markets. As Ukraine started the transition towards a market economy in the early 1990s, the HIID supported a survey on barter in transition economies. In 1993, the HIID managed an education sector assessment in El Salvador under contract from USAID, the purpose being to obtain reliable information for use in setting a national educational policy. The HIID and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum jointly produced the 1997 Global Competitiveness Report based on a late-1996 survey of 2,827 firms in 53 countries. Among other questions, respondents were asked to say how often they saw evidence of corruption, and the answers were used to rank each country. In mid-1998 the World Economic Forum and HIID assembled a team of experts to determine the causes of the Asian financial crisis and the mechanisms of the crisis, to determine methods of reducing the probability of similar crises in the future and to identify policy changes that would help the affected countries resume growth. In the late 1990s, USAID sponsored the Equity and Growth through Economic Research (EAGER) project, with the HIID commissioning work in eleven African countries. Both public strategies for growth and trade regimes for growth had both been intensively studied in the past, but resulting reforms had met little success. The focus of the EAGER research was to understand why programs had not been sustained, and what could be done to change that. The above are just examples of the many research projects undertaken by the Institute. Russian aid controversy Anatoly Borisovich Chubais, who worked closely with HIID advisers in Russia. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded a project by the HIID to help rebuild the Russian economy on the basis of western concepts of ethics, democracy and free markets. Jeffrey Sachs was said to have \\"packaged HIID as an AID consultant\\". USAID were glad to accept help from Harvard, since they lacked expertise for such a project. The HIID oversaw and guided disbursement of $300 million of US aid to Russia with little oversight by USAID. HIID advisers worked closely with representatives from Russia, notably Anatoly Chubais and his associates. Once USAID accepted help from the HIID, HIID was in a position to recommend U.S. aid policies while being a recipient of that aid. It also put the HIID in a position of power overseeing some of their competitors.Janine R. Wedel. \\"Shadow Elite\\", Basic Books, 2009. pages 118-119. The project, which ran from 1992 to 1997, was headed by economist Andrei Shleifer and lawyer Jonathan Hay. HIID received $40.4 million in return for its activities in Russia, awarded without the normal competitive bidding approach. In 1996 the US Congress asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the HIID activities in the Russian aid program after multiple complaints to the congressional office had been made. The initial published GAO report considered the USAID's oversight over Harvard's Russia project \\"lax.\\" The US government attempted to hold the Harvard players responsible for their clear conflicts of interest and undeniable misuse of government money but action was slow to ensue.Janine R. Wedel. \\"Shadow Elite\\", Basic Books, 2009. pages 144-145 The original GAO report was critical, and further funding was withdrawn from HIID on the basis that as a contractor HIID has \\"abused the trust of the U.S. government by using personal relationships for private gain\\". in 1997, the USAID ended a $14 million grant to the Harvard Institute for International Development after Andrei Shleifer was accused of using the institute to help his wife Nancy Zimmerman's investments in Russia. As part of a settlement, Zimmerman subsequently paid $1.5 million to the USG through one of her companies, Farallon Fixed Income Associates. In September 2000 Shleifer and Hay were accused by the Justice Department of making personal investments in Russia, and therefore failing to act as impartial advisers. The episode became a factor in the dismissal of Larry Summers, who had set up the project as deputy secretary of the treasury under President Bill Clinton. Dissolution The President of the institute from 1995, Jeffrey Sachs, resigned in 1999 to form the Center for International Development (CID), which would focus more on academic research than on consulting. The CID was founded as a joint project of the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the HIID. A task force was appointed in July 1999 to review the future of the HIID, which in January 2000 concluded that it should be dissolved, with its functions distributed to faculties within the University. Reasons included the Russian conflict of interest scandal, structural problems and financial deficits in 1998 and 1999. In 2005, the university was required to pay the US government a settlement of $26.5 million for their involvement in the Russian development scandal.Janine R. Wedel. \\"Shadow Elite\\", Basic Books, 2009. Page 144. The CID, housed at the Harvard Kennedy School, is now Harvard's primary center for research on international development. Selected publications The institute began issuing a series of Development Discussion Papers soon after it began operation, and eventually published more than 700 papers by HIID staff members documenting their project experience and research results. Sub-series covered agriculture and food policy, education, taxation, economic reform and the environment. The HIID also published some full-length books that covered broader topics.

The Sharman books are characterised by their noir tone and their fast action, and feature a high casualty rate among their characters; Sharman himself is frequently injured or even hospitalised in the course of the novels. The books formed the basis for the TV series Sharman, in which Clive Owen played the eponymous detective; Timlin made a cameo appearance in the pilot episode. Before commencing his writing career, Timlin worked in a variety of jobs such as being a roadie for rock groups including T Rex and The Who, running a Clapham Junction music venue, minicab driver, and proprietor of a skateboard company. In 1985 he was unemployed and living in a friend's abandoned bus. Turning to writing as a way out of living on benefits, he wrote his first novel, A Good Year for the Roses, which was published as a paperback original in 1988. The Sharman series is now in double figures; in early years, Timlin published prolifically. Almost all of the Sharman books carry titles which are taken from songs. He has cited influences on his work as including Ed McBain, Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, Richard Stark and John D. McDonald.\\"About the Author\\" preface to 101 Best TV Crime Series Both the violent nature of the Sharman novels, and remarks made by Timlin himself, have made the author a figure of controversy. He resigned from the Crime Writers' Association, saying he \\"would rather stick needles in my eyes\\" than ever rejoin, and was scornful of comments made by P. D. James, who argued that cosy mysteries presented opportunities to depict moral choices which hardboiled style novels lacked; Timlin claimed \\"I write about the reality I see on the streets of south London\\" and insisted that Sharman \\"has his own morals\\". Other writers such as Val McDermid were also critical of James' opinions.The Independent, 15 September 1995 Timlin lives in London's Docklands.

It was also the former home to both the BMW New Zealand Open and the New Zealand PGA Championship that was staged on the Nationwide Tour. Designed by John Darby in consultation with New Zealand golfing legend, Sir Bob Charles, the course combines elements of links golf inspired by the great Scottish courses with parkland golf, more reminiscent of Florida. Clearwater hosted the inaugural New Zealand Women's Open in 2009 that was won by Frenchwoman Gwladys Nocera, and at the time, the number-one player in Europe. She won by six shots from four players on eight under par. The ISPS Handa NZ Women's Open returned to Clearwater in 2013 and was won by Lydia Ko who was playing as an amateur. Lydia became not only the first New Zealand woman to win her national tournament but also the youngest player to ever win a Ladies European Tour event. In 2014 South Korean Mi Hyang Lee scored a course record final round of 63 (9 under par) to win the championship by 1 shot from Lydia Ko. The 2015 ISPS Handa NZ Women's Open featured Lydia Ko, then ranked as the World number 1 player, and Charley Hull who topped the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit in 2014. Record crowds witnessed Lydia Ko set a new course record in the second round, and a career low score for herself, of 61. Incredibly the three ball of Lydia Ko (61), Charley Hull (64) and Su-Hyun Oh (66) recorded a combined score of 25 under par.

MobiCon revolutionizes sensor networks by determining which sensors would be active for the application rather than sensing all sensors at the same time.MobiCon Paper Depending on application demand, the MobiCon platform selects which resource optimization plan to execute in order to ensure that all applications receive resources they need in the most efficient manner. Technology MobiCon is an initial attempt to provide an active resource orchestration system, recognizing the PAN-scale (Personal Area Network) sensor-rich mobile platform as a common underlying computing platform. Mobicon records human activity via predicates (e.g. \\"location  'library') connected by logical operators that run for a specified amount of time. Rationale The central challenge around MobiCon is simultaneously supporting numerous applications using very limited resources. Furthermore, these available resources dynamically change due to their wearable forms and the user‚Äôs mobility. Also, resource usage by running applications or environmental factors such as interference continuously affects the resource availability. These challenges require system level support. Each application must efficiently share the limited resources. Without system-level support, however, each individual application has an extremely limited view of the existence or resource uses of other applications, and further cannot negotiate with the concurrent applications for coordinated and efficient resource utilization. MobiCon helps applications share resources and processing by seamlessly adapting the applications to dynamic resource availability by resolving resource contention between applications or selecting the best processing plan according to the resource availability at that time. The MobiCon Middleware Computing Platform can seamlessly adapt the resources committed to each application so that all system resources can be used the most efficiently. Design MobiCon prepares multiple alternative resource use plans that process a high-level context from applications resulting from the diversity of semantic translation. MobiCon supports multiple context-aware applications to extend run time and balancing resource usage in environments with highly limited yet dynamic resources. At runtime, MobiCon dynamically chooses which resource plan to execute based on the resource needs of the applications in real time. Prototype MobiCon was tested by a team of Researchers including Seungwoo Kang and S. Sitharama Iyengar on two platforms ‚Äì standard C/C++ over Linux and open C/C++ over S60 SDK and Symbian OS. The prototype processor included eight featured extraction using kiss_fft, a fast Fourier transform library to derive frequency-domain features while also providing a recognition module that implemented a decision tree algorithm. =Results= The first MobiCon prototype shows superior scalability and energy efficiency. Furthermore, processing time has shrunk dramatically compared with other present technology. Data transmission was reduced by almost 50 percent. References External * Dr S. S.

In American football, rushing and passing are the two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. A rush, also known as a running play, generally occurs when the quarterback hands or tosses the ball backwards to the running back, but other players, such as the quarterback, can run with the ball. In the National Football League (NFL), the player who has recorded the most rushing yards for a season is considered the winner of the rushing title for that season. In addition to the NFL rushing champion, league record books recognize the rushing champions of the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the National Football League in 1970. The NFL did not begin keeping official records until the 1932 season. Since the adoption of the 14-game season in 1961, all but two rushing champions have recorded over 1,000 yards rushing. Seven rushing champions have recorded over 2,000 rushing yards, a feat first accomplished by O. J. Simpson in 1973 and most recently achieved by Adrian Peterson in 2012. The player with the most rushing titles is Jim Brown, who was the rushing champion eight times over his career. Eric Dickerson, Emmitt Smith, O. J. Simpson, Steve Van Buren, and Barry Sanders are tied for the second-most rushing titles, each having won four times. Jim Brown also holds the record for the most consecutive rushing titles with five, having led the league in rushing each year from 1957 to 1961. Steve Van Buren, Emmitt Smith, and Earl Campbell each recorded three consecutive rushing titles. The Cleveland Browns have recorded the most rushing titles with eleven; the Dallas Cowboys rank second, with seven rushing titles. The most recent rushing champion is Derrick Henry of the Tennessee Titans, who led the league with 1,540 yards rushing over the 2019 season. List of NFL rushing title winners Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White, a future associate justice of the US Supreme Court, won the league rushing title in 1938 and 1940. Gale Sayers led the NFL in rushing in 1966 and 1969. Eric Dickerson led the league in rushing in 1983 and 1984, his first two seasons in the league, and won two more titles in 1986 and 1988. Emmitt Smith was the league's rushing champion four times, including three consecutive years from 1991 to 1993. LaDainian Tomlinson won back-to-back rushing titles in 2006 and 2007, and is the most recent player to do so. Adrian Peterson led the league in rushing in the 2008, 2012, and 2015 seasons. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center; background:#ff9;\\"^ Pro Football Hall of Fame member - !

The tenth and most recent visit was by President Donald Trump on October 3, 2017.Trump sees ‚Äòmiracle‚Äô Puerto Rico survival, ignores critics. Apnews.com. Retrieved on October 3, 2017. Nine presidents are honored by life- sized bronze statues commissioned and placed in a linear park, called Paseo de los Presidentes, on the south side of San Juan, Puerto Rico's Capitol Building. Official visits Official visits are formal visits (official visit) to the local government, during which the President acts as an official attendee of the local government at a public ceremony. Some Official visits may also be surveying damage after a natural disaster. =Theodore Roosevelt= President Theodore Roosevelt was the first sitting president to visit Puerto Rico arriving on the USS Louisiana (BB 19) on November 21, 1906 after inspecting the Panama Canal. A bronze statue and plaque commemorating his visit is on public view at the Paseo de los Presidentes on the south side of the Capitol of Puerto Rico. =Herbert Hoover= President Herbert Hoover was the second president to visit America's most populated territory during March 1931 on board the USS Arizona (BB 39) which called at Ponce. His bronze statue was unveiled in 2008 by his great-granddaughter, Fox News commentator Margaret Hoover and then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock and subsequently installed with a bronze plaque by Senate President Thomas Rivera-Schatz and House Speaker Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n at the Paseo de los Presidentes. =Franklin D. Roosevelt= President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Puerto Rico during July 6‚Äì7, 1934 on board the USS Houston (CA 30). The commemorative statue honoring his visit was unveiled in April, 2008 by the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, then-Senate President McClintock and House Speaker Jos√© Aponte-Hern√°ndez. The statue is believed to be only the third to depict him sitting in a wheelchair (the other two are located in the FDR Memorial in Washington, DC). Next to his statue, there is a bronze depiction of his pet dog, Fala. The statue, the bronze depiction of the dog and a plaque were subsequently installed by Senate President Rivera-Schatz and Speaker Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n at the Paseo de los Presidentes. =John F. Kennedy= President John F. Kennedy and his wife visited Puerto Rico on December 15‚Äì16, 1961, arriving in a VC-137A, spending the night as guests of Gov. Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n at La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere. The guest bedroom in which he stayed subsequently became known as the \\"Kennedy Bedroom\\". On December 16 they continued the flight to Venezuela. Upon the completion of the South American tour, they flew from Colombia to Ramey AFB for a refuel stop on December 18 and continued to Palm Beach, Florida. Kennedy did not leave the aircraft during that stop at Ramey. Until President Obama's June 14, 2011, trip to Puerto Rico, for over 49 years Kennedy's visit, which included a motorcade in addition to the visit to the governor's mansion, had been considered the last official visit by a sitting president at the time, notwithstanding President Johnson's private visit in 1968 to Ramey AFB in Aguadilla and President Ford's attendance at the 1976 G-7 summit in Dorado. =Barack Obama= President Barack Obama made an official visit to Puerto Rico for four hours on June 14, 2011. Arriving on Air Force One a VC-25A (Boeing 747) 92-8000 with then-Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, he was greeted at Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, Puerto Rico, by Governor Luis Fortu√±o, visited La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere, had lunch at a local eatery with then-Senator Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla, gave exclusive interviews to Univision local TV affiliate reporter Cyd Marie Fleming and El Nuevo D√≠a newspaper, and attended a Democratic National Committee event that added nearly $1 millionhttp://www.bellinghamherald.com/2011/06/14/2059496/obama- courts-us-puerto-rican-votes.html to his campaign coffers, before flying to Washington, D.C. with Pierluisi. A bronze statue of him commemorating the visit was commissioned by, and installed at the Paseo de los Presidentes by then-Senate President Thomas Rivera-Schatz and House Speaker Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n. It is considered one of the first public statues depicting the then-sitting president during the first of two full terms in office. =Donald Trump= President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico for about 4 hours on October 3, 2017, to discuss Hurricane Maria. Trump arrived on Air Force One at the Mu√±iz Air National Guard Basetogether with First Lady Melania Trump and Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n, the first woman ever to hold the office of Puerto Rico's sole Representative to the U.S. Congress , they shook the hands of military members stationed at the base. He later held a press briefing on relief efforts- which was also attended by San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz and various Puerto Rican officials-, held a meeting with senior military personnel ‚Äì as well as with Governors Ricardo Rossell√≥ of Puerto Rico and Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands ‚Äî, visited with people who were impacted by the storm, and met with members of the Navy and Marine Corps. Following the tradition set by President McClintock and Speaker Hern√°ndez in 2008, eventually a bronze statue and plaque commemorating President Trump's visit is expected to be commissioned and installed at the Paseo de los Presidentes by current President Rivera-Schatz and House Speaker Carlos \\"Johnny\\" M√©ndez. Unofficial visits Unofficial visits are vacations, fund- raising for campaigns, having never left a military base or naval vessel, and other personal reasons (golf, etc) where the president is not an attendee of the local government. =Dwight Eisenhower= President Dwight D. Eisenhower also visited Puerto Rico on his way to a goodwill visit to South America. Landed at San Juan International airport in a VC-137A on February 22, 1960 and was received by Gov.

Upon completion of his South American tour he returned to Ramey AFB on March 3 staying there until March 7 on vacation. During that time he played golf at Ramey AFB and at the Dorado Beach Hotel to where he flew in a U.S. Army VH-34 on March 4 and again on March 6 in a U.S. Air Force C-47 from Ramey. The bronze statue commemorating that visit is one of the first seven commissioned by the Puerto Rico Legislature. =Harry S. Truman= President Harry S. Truman, who in 1946 appointed the last appointive governor, and first Puerto Rican to officially become the territory's chief executive, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed the Elective Governors Act of 1947, and allowed Puerto Ricans to draft their own constitution, also visited Puerto Rico during his tenure as President. On February 21, 1948 he landed at the Isla Grande airport on board a VC-54C and left for St. Thomas the next day on board the Presidential yacht USS Williamsburg (AGC 369). A life-sized bronze statue and plaque commemorating his visit was unveiled by Senate President McClintock and House Speaker Aponte-Hern√°ndez is exhibited on the south side of the Puerto Rico Capitol building. =Lyndon B. Johnson= President Lyndon B. Johnson visited Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla on March 2‚Äì4, 1968 in a private trip that began in Beaumont, Texas, and a layover in Marietta, Georgia to inaugurate the first C-5A military aircraft before flying to Puerto Rico. He arrived in a VC-137C at 5:10 pm AST. During his trip he remained on-base during his entire stay and had no contact with Puerto Rican officials, except for a brief welcoming call from former Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n on March 3. He was accompanied by Congressman J. J. Pickle, among others. The statue commemorating his visit was commissioned by President Rivera Schatz and Speaker Gonz√°lez, after Aguadilla native Hayde√© Reichard called former Senate President McClintock's attention to the omission of Johnson's statue, subsequently installed at the Paseo de los Presidentes. =Gerald Ford= While President Gerald Ford visited Puerto Rico on June 26‚Äì28, 1976, arriving in VC-137C 72-7000 to attend the second annual G-7 economic summit, his trip is not considered an official visit to Puerto Rico, although he was welcomed by Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon at the airport.Presidente viene a jugar golf ‚Äì El Nuevo D√≠a.

Early life and education Roache was born in South Boston, and was a 1954 graduate of South Boston High School. He then served in the United States Marine Corps until 1959, and worked for Sears Roebuck in The Fenway neighborhood of Boston for 10 years, while attending Boston State College. Career =Law enforcement= Roache joined the Boston Police Department (BPD) in 1968. On February 1, 1985, as a lieutenant who headed the BPD's Community Disorders Unit, Roache was appointed acting Police Commissioner. On March 13, he was sworn in as permanent Commissioner by his lifelong friend, Mayor of Boston Raymond Flynn. During his tenure as Commissioner, Roache instituted mandatory drug testing for BPD employees and won praise for his efforts to root out corruption in the department. Roache was Commissioner during the Charles Stuart case. The police's mishandling of the case caused African-American leaders to call for Roache's resignation. In December 1990, the Massachusetts Attorney General's office released a report which detailed a variety of civil rights violations committed by the BPD. Violations described in the report included random frisking of minority youth and coercing witnesses to testify in the Stuart case. After several shootings of unarmed victims by police, alleged mismanagement in the Internal Affairs Department, and a report issued by United States Attorney Wayne Budd detailing allegations of police misconduct, Mayor Flynn was pressured to fire Roache. Flynn refused to fire Roache, which caused critics of the police department to claim that Roache's friendship with the Mayor was the reason he was still Commissioner. During the 1991 mayoral election, candidate Edward J. Doherty promised that if elected, he would fire Roache. Flynn appointed a commission led by Boston attorney James D. St. Clair to investigate the BPD. The commission recommended that Flynn fire Roache. On June 24, 1993, Roache announced his resignation, effective June 30. =Politics= After his resignation, Roache became a candidate for Mayor of Boston in the 1993 election to succeed Ray Flynn, who had resigned to become United States Ambassador to the Holy See. Roache finished in seventh place in the preliminary election with 3.01% of the vote. Roache was elected to the Boston City Council in November 1995 as an at-large councilor. He was reelected in 1997, 1999, and 2001. In 2002, he left the City Council to become Suffolk County Registrar of Deeds, a position he held until his resignation on December 31, 2015. Personal life Roache and his wife, Barbara (n√©e Campers), raised five children: Barbara, Donna, Paula, Michael, and Lori. They resided in Quincy, Massachusetts, and later the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. He was a practicing Roman Catholic, often attending mass daily. Roache died on December 17, 2018, at the age of 82.

He was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Early life He wrote and directed his first play when he was eleven. He moved with his family to Long Beach, California, when he was thirteen. Though he felt out of place for most of the first year in Long Beach, he eventually became student body president of his high school, claiming he ran because one of the perks of office was to crown and kiss the homecoming queen. During the 1960s, Chitlik attended the University of California, Berkeley, as an undergraduate. As a junior, he spent a year at the University of Madrid under the auspices of the UC Education Abroad Program. After graduating, he entered the PhD program in comparative literature at UCSD, then transferred to UC, Berkeley, once again. He returned to Spain after a year where he lived and worked in Madrid. It was there that he also published his first work in any language - a Spanish poem. After a year in Madrid, Chitlik migrated to London where he worked as a translator, photographer, and journalist for several years after the traditional writer‚Äôs series of jobs ‚Äì stock boy in a deli, baker, house cleaner, house painter, and, eventually consultant for famed publisher Calder & Boyars. Eventually he worked as a reporter for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. He also freelanced as a photographer and journalist. His photographs and articles appeared in English, Welsh, Spanish, US, and Israeli periodicals. When he returned to Los Angeles he worked as a technical translator and E.S.L. instructor at Long Beach Community College. Soon, he was an administrator devising programs for non-literate students in the Indo-Chinese Refugee Assistance Program. His work with non-literature adults who often did not even have a written language of their own led to his being a consultant for the state funded Dissemination Network for Adult Educators teaching other teachers how to deal with this new population. During this time he was also on the board of directors of La Escuela Laboral, a bilingual school for adults in East Los Angeles, and the Human Powered Transit Association, a bicycle advocacy group. He was responsible for the creation of the HPTA's bicycle safety program in the L.A. Unified School District. He also served as Executive Director of AVAZ International Dance Theatre. He was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to attend the first White House Conference on Library and Information Services. After moving to Burbank with his then wife, Chitlik served on the School Facilities Committee of Burbank, overseeing the expenditure of $200 million in the rebuilding of the city‚Äôs schools for ten years, nine as chair. He also served as President and kitchen supervisor of Project Chicken Soup, an organization that provides kosher meals to people with HIV/AIDS. He remains on the board of directors. Career In 1984 he wrote his second play, ‚ÄúCasanova Goldberg,‚Äù which received a staged reading in Los Angeles, but before it could be produced, Chitlik did a career about-face and began to write for television, first as the executive story editor for a syndicated series, \\"Guilty or Innocent,\\" and later as a staff writer with writing partner, Jeremy Bertrand Finch, for the Showtime series,\\"Brothers.\\" Chitlik and Finch wrote for CBS' \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Who's the Boss?,\\" and NBC's \\"Amen.\\" https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158328/ Chitlik joined the Writers Guild of America, west, in 1986, and has been an active member since, serving on the Academic Liaison Committee, the Publications Board, and, most recently, on the Writers with Disabilities Committee. In 1999 he assisted the Guild‚Äôs public affairs office in their lobbying efforts in Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Burbank. In 2009, he produced the first Hollywood Disabilities Forum featuring Peter Farrelly and Ricky Gervais at UCLA, under the auspices of the WGA and the Screen Actors Guild. When The Twilight Zone was revived for syndication, Chitlik and Finch were brought on board by Executive Producer Mark Shelmerdine to set the direction and tone of the program as story editors. The show has gone on to prove itself a ratings success and takes its place alongside the original as innovative and stimulating programming. Chitlik and Finch won a Writers Guild of America award nomination for one of the \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes they wrote during this time.http://sftv.lmu.edu/meetthefacultystaff/faculty/?expert=paul.chitlikhttp://www.rewritementor.com/about.htm Chitlik and Finch developed \\"Poltergeist\\" for television for a partnership of MGM, Paragon Pictures, and ARD Television of Germany; sold a romantic comedy to Bay Productions of Vancouver; created a sit-com for Republic Pictures; wrote a pilot for \\"Lifetime;\\" and developed \\"Alcohol Lake,\\" a story of hope and cultural re-awakening of Native Americans, with KCET for American Playhouse. Chitlik went on to be coordinating producer for ‚ÄúReal Stories of the Highway Patrol,‚Äù one of the most successful first run daily strip programs on television. In addition to overseeing the story development, scripting, directing, and editing of over 260 reenactment segments, he field produced and directed more than a dozen himself.

He is known for being one of the first victims of Diocletian's religious persecution. He is said to have refused to obey the emperor's order to worship an idol of the pagan god Apollo. He was then punished by being thrown into a fiery furnace, in a manner similar to the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. But, by the power of God, he was kept alive. The emperor came and checked the furnace at night, and he saw Theopemptus alive and praying. Diocletian then claimed the miracle was because of magic. He then depriving Theopemptus of food and drink for twenty-two days, but, by another miracle of God, he was kept alive and healthy. The emperor then called upon the renowned sorcerer Theonas to overcome Theopemptus' 'mystical powers'. Theonas tried several times to poison Theopemptus, but each time the poison left him unharmed. Upon seeing that Theopemptus was still healthy, Theonas converted to Christianity. They were then imprisoned together, where Theopemptus baptized and taught him in the ways of Christ. Theopemptus then changed Theonas' name to Synesios. Diocletian then tried again to convert Theopemptus to paganism. Upon seeing that he would not convert, the emperor tortured and beheaded him. Theonas, likewise, refused to worship idols and was buried alive in a deep ditch.

It consists of \\"The Triplet Cities\\" of Dammam, Khobar, Dhahran and their vicinities. It has an estimated population of 1.75 million (2015). It is known for the arts, pearl culturing, entertainment and popular music and sports legacies. The area includes a variety of natural landscapes, parks, and beaches with a recreational coastline to the Persian Gulf. The Greater Dammam area is also known for being one of the cornerstones of the oil industry with the world's largest oil company and most valuable company, Saudi Aramco, being based in Dhahran, as a result of the first oil well being dug in the area.  History  Several tombs, remnants, artifacts and historical references suggest that the area was inhabited more than two thousand years ago. However, most vestiges of human habitation were buried by the encroaching desert sands and the area had been largely deserted for centuries. Modern history King Fahd Mosque, Dammam The area was first inhabited by a clan of Al Dossary tribe and a number of the Al Howela families in early 1923. The families led by Sheikh Ahmed ibn Abdullah Al Dossary migrated from Bahrain and were offered to choose land to settle in the area by King Abdul Aziz Ibn Sa'ud Al Sa'ud. Dammam was immediately chosen for its vicinity to the island of Bahrain as the clan hoped to head back there soon, but the British rule in the region made it very hard for them to move so they finally settled in Dammam. Years later, Sheikh Ahmed's brother and his family moved south to Al Khobar, which by that time was already inhabited. The arrival of the Sheikh Ahmed's brother resulted in a population boost for Khobar and closer ties with the bigger city of Dammam. When the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, the area was the site of several small settlements that depended on fishing and pearls for their survival. The area's transformation was launched with the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. The Dammam No.7 well proved beyond doubt that the Kingdom possessed a large supply of hydrocarbons. Over the span of a little more than half a century, the area has developed into a thriving hub of industry, commerce and science, and home to around two million people. New oil fields discovered during the 1940s and 1950s, now account for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves. Experts and technicians from the Kingdom and from around the world gathered to help search for new oil fields and bring them on- stream. The Khobar Water Tower where many spectators gather to witness dramatic fireworks shows at special occasions such as the 'Eid al-Fitr and 'Eid al-Adha. The growing number of expatriates working in Dhahran required the building of housing, hospitals, schools for their children and other amenities. Before long, Dhahran, the corporate headquarters of Saudi Aramco, was growing in all directions. The growth of the oil industry in the region had a similar impact on the small fishing villages of Dammam and Khobar. Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the huts of the fishermen that crowded the shore, which constituted the only permanent dwellings in the area, had given way to concrete buildings and modern housing, highways and streets. Located on the Persian Gulf coast east of Dhahran, Khobar briefly became the shipping point for Saudi Arabian crude oil to the refinery in Bahrain. In the years leading up to and during World War II, Saudi Arabian oil production was very limited, and since the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent by small tankers to Bahrain. With the construction of a pipeline to Bahrain and the subsequent expansion of the oil industry in the post-war years, the focus of the shipping and oil industries shifted from Khobar to Dammam and Ra's Tanura, one of the largest oil storage and shipping centers in the world, located 25 km north of Dammam. As a result, Khobar gradually found a new role as the commercial center for the entire region. King Abdul Aziz Center for World Culture was built as a tourist attraction near the headquarters of Saudi Aramco in Dhahran. In the early 1980s, Dammam, the capital of the Eastern Province, was a separate city but so close to Khobar and Dhahran that one could pass from one to the other in a few minutes. The discovery of oil in Dhahran and nearby fields and the growing importance of the entire region affected Dammam more than any other city in Saudi Arabia. Within three decades, the fishing village, now a city, had become the capital of the largest province of Saudi Arabia. The simultaneous growth of the \\"Triplet Cities\\" brought the three jurisdictions into physical contact, the three towns inevitably merged into one, creating a single municipality known as the Dammam metropolitan area, referred to simply as Dammam or Greater Dammam. Each of the three towns still retains its own character and some local administrative functions but, in terms of their place in the Kingdom, Dammam forms a single administrative entity. The park at Corniche in Khobar The growth of the Saudi Arabian oil industry brought about rapid development in the region. As oil production increased, so did the number of people required to run the industry. The growing population needed more housing and services. First-rate hospitals and schools were built, service industries sprouted up to support the oil industry and meet the needs of people living in the area. As a result, a region which had several hundred inhabitants some sixty years ago now boasts a population of well over 1.5 million, growing at a pace of over five percent a year. The area did not just develop a booming oil industry, it developed in all spheres. It is now a modern urban and industrial center. As oil production was growing in the early years, the Saudi Arabian government took steps to facilitate the evolution of Greater Dammam. New roads and highways connected the area to other urban and industrial centers in the Kingdom. A railway line was built to connect the area to the capital, Riyadh. The Dhahran International Airport was established between Dhahran and Khobar to connect the region to other parts of the Kingdom and beyond. The Dammam No. 7 well on March 4, 1938. In many ways, this was the spark needed to light the fire of development in the region. To encourage the growth of non-oil industries, an industrial city, the 1st Industrial City of Dammam, was established in the open space between the three cities. This industrial complex was swiftly engulfed by the urban mass. As a result, the 2nd Industrial City of Dammam was established further away from the metropolitan area along the highway to Abqaiq and Hofuf. Together, these two industrial cities house more than 300 factories which manufacture a variety of consumer and industrial products that are marketed throughout the Kingdom and exported to other countries around the world. Handling such exports as well as imports from abroad, is the domain of shipping agents and commercial companies located in Dammam and Khobar, making the area not only a major oil producing and exporting area, but also a commercial and shipping center. The swift growth of the region necessitated the construction of a larger and more modern airport to replace the Dhahran International Airport. The new King Fahd International Airport serves not just the Dammam metropolitan area, but the entire Eastern Province. Having been built from the ground up, the area was designed from the outset on the principles of modern urban planning. Residential areas are separate from commercial sections, roads are broad and straight and buildings conform to a master plan. One of the main features of the development of the area is land reclamation. Vast stretches of the shallow Persian Gulf have been filled, with hotels and office buildings occupying what were once marshes. Water for household, urban and industrial use is provided by desalination plants that supply approximately seven million cubic feet of treated water to the area each day. The availability of water underpins the urban and industrial growth of the area and provisions have been made for expanding existing desalination facilities to meet future growth. In many ways, the Dammam metropolitan area has evolved as the link between Saudi Arabia and the outside world, exporting the Kingdom's products and importing its needs and thriving on the interaction between Saudi Arabia and other countries. Transportation By air Greater Dammam is served by the King Fahd International Airport, the largest airport in the world by land area (~780 km¬≤), about 20 km northwest of Dammam. The airport serves an estimated 9.8 million people annually (2017). Some people also use the nearby Bahrain International Airport in Manama, Bahrain. By sea Dammam's King Abdul Aziz Sea Port is the largest on the Persian Gulf, with import-export traffic in the country second only to the Jeddah Islamic Port on the Red Sea near the city of Jeddah. It is one of the most important ports in the country and is under the supervision of the Saudi Ports Authority. By rail The area is connected to the cities of Abqaiq, Hofuf and the capital, Riyadh by two railway lines maintained by the Saudi Railways Organization. Major highways Greater Dammam is served by the following highways: 30x30px Route 40 to Riyadh, Makkah, Ta'if and Jeddah. 30x30px Route 95 to the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, to the south & Jubail and Khafji to the north. 30x30px Route 605 connecting Khobar, Dammam and the King Fahd International Airport. 30x30px Route 613 to Qatif, Ra's Tanura, Jubail and Ra's Al Khair Route 610 Route 615 Route 617 Mashreq network The Mashreq network uses Highway 40 and Highway 95 to complete Mashreq M80 to Bahrain, while Highway 95, which continues northward toward Kuwait, is also part of Mashreq M5. Named bridges and tunnels The King Fahd Causeway (Mashreq M80) connects Khobar to Bahrain. The causeway is popularly known as the Bahrain Bridge.

Through various companies, they controlled at one time or another large swathes of California real estate, much of it derived from Mexican land grants. Over several generations, their holdings included Rancho Los Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos, and parts of Rancho San Justo and Rancho Palos Verdes, totaling well over 100,000 acres. Parts of the towns of Long Beach, Bellflower, Paramount, Signal Hill, Lakewood, and Los Alamitos emerged from former Bixby-held lands. In Long Beach, the area of Bixby Knolls and Bixby Park are named after the family. The key members of the family connected to California real estate are the brothers Llewellyn and Jotham Bixby, their first cousins Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and a cousin of the next generation, John William Bixby. Llewellyn's daughter Sarah Bixby Smith wrote a well-known memoir of growing up on the Bixby family ranches in the late 19th century; her second husband, Paul Jordan-Smith, was also a writer. Jotham's daughter Fanny Bixby Spencer was a philanthropist and anti-war activist who was also one of the nation's earliest policewomen. Bixby genealogy * Solomon Bixby (b. 1761) m.

Journalism Masyuk graduated from Moscow State University with a degree in journalism. In 1994, she began working for the then-independent television station NTV, covering the First Chechen War. She later stated that in her reporting, she tried \\"to show the Chechen side of the story, to give them a chance to tell their point of view, to show how terrible the war was for civilians and even Russian soldiers\\". The coverage earned her and NTV Russia's top television awards. Masyuk went on from Chechnya to report in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. According to The Washington Post, \\"her name became synonymous with hot-spot journalism\\", and her crew became known as \\"the bravest, brashest and most professional reporters on the scene\\". She was also noted for the quality of her contacts within Chechnya. In 2004, Masyuk created a four-part documentary entitled The Character of Friendship, exploring potential dangers in the Sino-Russian relationship. Despite orders from many local governments that it not be allowed to air, the documentary was shown widely across Russia. She works in Novaya Gazeta since 2012. Legal issues After the first of Masyuk's reports showing the violence in Chechnya, Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets attempted to revoke NTV's license to broadcast in retaliation. Masyuk was threatened directly with prosecution following an interview with Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev immediately after the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis, in which Basayev succeeded in taking over 1,000 civilian hostages. The attorney general's office formally investigated Masyuk under Article 189 of the Criminal Code (harboring a criminal) and Article 190 (failure to report a crime), but the case was dropped after the attorney general was forced to resign for unrelated corruption charges. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, founder of the strongly nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, accused Masyuk in 1996 of being on the payroll of Chechen separatists. Masyuk took Zhirinovsky to court for slander, and in December 1997, the court ordered him to publicly apologize and to pay Masyuk $5,000 in damages. In 1998, Masyuk was declared persona non grata by the Foreign Ministry of Tajikistan after broadcasting reports critical of the nation's government. Abduction In early 1997, Masyuk had been pulled from a Chechen assignment due to threats against her. However, she persuaded her editor to allow her to cover a rally in the Chechen capital of Grozny and conduct an interview with rebel commander Salman Raduyev. On 10 May, Masyuk, cameraman Ilya Mordyukov, and sound engineer Dmitri Ulchev were returning from Grozny to Ingushetia when six masked, armed men stopped their car. The three journalists were then forced into another vehicle at gunpoint and driven from the scene. They would be held for 101 days, the final two months of which were spent in a forest cave. During this time, Amnesty International announced a campaign for her release, as did The Committee to Protect Journalists. On 18 August, NTV paid a $2 million ransom, and the three were released. Masyuk later commented that she felt the kidnappings had been tactically foolish by the rebels in terms of public image: \\"Chechens made $16 million on journalists last year, but they lost much more ... They lost the journalists' confidence that they had had during the war.\\" She added that the result was \\"an information blockade\\" surrounding the region. Awards and recognition Masyuk was named a Duke University media fellow in 1995, teaching at the DeWitt Wallace Center for Communications and Journalism. Following her release from captivity in 1997, she also won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. She is a member of Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights.

The goddess in this temple is supposed to be in her very fierce form. She is also considered as the younger sister of Parakkattu Bhagwathi who has a temple in Kavasseri near by.  History  Mangottu Bhagawathi is supposed to have come to this place to fulfill the desire of a weaver. This weaver,Kuttan, was a great devotee of the Goddess. He and his people wove clothes and sold them in places where festivals were held. It is said that at one place, he was so enchanted by the appearance of the Devi there that he mentally requested her to come along with him. At that time, there was a whirl wind which removed the clothes of the idol of the Goddess which was being taken out in procession. Kuttan immediately threw the cloth that he had brought to sell on to the goddess. This cloth fell on the Goddess and got attached there. Next day Kuttan returned to his village. He was carrying an Umbrella. At a particular point he got so tired that he kept the Umbrella on floor and slept near by. When he woke up, he was not able to remove the umbrella from the ground. An astrologer was summoned who told Kuttan that the Goddess has occupied the Umbrella and she wants to live in this place. Then the astrologer threw the stick in his hand and told that a temple should be built where it falls. This place is the present Athipotha.  Important Dates  In the month of Medam (April‚ÄìMay) a festival is conducted here lasting seven days, after the first Sunday of that month. Apart from that after the Pooram festival of Parakkattu Bhagawathi temple, that Bhagawathi shuts her temple and comes and stays in Athipotha for seven days during the month of Meenam (March‚ÄìApril). Every year the annual festival (vela) is conducted on the second Sunday after Vishu (in April), the starting of the Malayalam new year. The Mangottu Kavu vela is preceded by a host of festivities starting exactly a week before the actual festival. On the first Sunday after vishu the Kodiyattum (Flag raising) ceremony is performed. On Monday there is a kari-kali dance festival, wherein members of the Mannadiar and Nair community visit all the Hindu homes in the locality and dance and sing the deities devotional songs. On Tuesday chamanz-kali follows. Here too members of the Mannadiar and Nair community sing devotional songs visiting each Hindu home in the locality. Wednesday there is Kumati festival. There are other cultural events like chakiyaar kutt, pavva kutt and so on during this festival period. A host of devotees arrive for the main vela festival. This is a very important temple and various types of worship are offered here. Some of them are Pana Patasam,Ney Payasam, Tri kala pooja, Chandattam, Sahasranama pooja etc. There are also special poojas along with chanting of Eika mathya Sooktham, Sri Sooktham and Bhagya Suktham. While there is a separate temple for Ganesa inside the temple, just outside is a temple for 'Mookan Chathan' a spirit.

This area of the Mediterranean Sea is prone to strong winds, making a safe journey around the island difficult. The island could be called a ships' graveyard, on account of the number of wrecked ships off its southeastern tip. Three wreck sites have been excavated under the direction of George Bass of Texas A&M; University. The first to be studied using archaeological techniques was a 4th-century Byzantine wreck, the second a 7th-century Byzantine wreck, and the third a 16th-century Ottoman wreck. Bass received funding for a summer excavation at the site from the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and the National Geographic Society. Description Yassi Ada is an island situated between Turgutreis and the Greek island of Pserimos. It measures 200 metres by 150 metres, with an elevation of 11 metres.Bass 1982, p. 3 Approximately 200 metres southwest of the island is a dangerous reef that has caught many sailors unawares. The ruins of several vessels that crashed into the hidden reef can be found there,Bass 1982, p. 4 representing a range of periods and styles. Ship material is sometimes visible on top of the reef, since it rises three metres above the surface of the water. Fieldwork The University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania under its director George Bass excavated a shipwreck site near Yassi Ada in 1967 and 1969. This expedition was funded by the Museum and the National Geographic Society. A few students from the university joined the team, along with an architect and a physician. The main site under excavation was a 4th-century vessel 19 metres in length, lying between 36 and 42 metres below the sea surface 100 metres south of Yassi Ada. Its hull was made of cypress, and the keel of white oak. There is also a 7th-century vessel near the reef, with one end resting over another wrecked vessel. Dating method Artifacts discovered at the main site included lamps, whose shapes were used to date the wreck. The vessel's mode of construction also helped to date the wreck site. The vessel was determined to be from the 4th century. Archaeological Finds Finds from the site include 1,100 amphorae in three different styles. The first style has a well-fired texture, is reddish-brown in color, and is estimated to hold 37‚Äì40 litres. The second is similar in pattern and design to the first, but its body is more cylindrical. The third style, the smallest, is estimated to hold 13.7‚Äì14.4 litres. Its base is round, with a button in the centre. The color is orange- brown. Byzantine trade history Trade with the East became important to acquire materials that were seen as necessities in the Byzantine Empire. This Empire had three main trade routes, ranging from the quickest to the safest. The quickest route took sailors through Sogdiana to Persia and thence to the Empire. The second quickest route went from the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea. The third route was the longest and safest. The Byzantine Empire often had conflicts with Persia, so this route bypassed Persian land to prevent Byzantine ships from being sunk or attacked. It went from Central Asia through the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, avoiding all contact with Persia. Some caravans loaded with silk did, however, pass through Persia to reach the Empire. Trade with Persians was risky because of the \\"frequent wars between Byzantine and Persia ... Roman commerce suffered heavily both through the interpretation of communication and through the raising of the price of raw material\\".Baynes p 209 In towns at war with Persia, the price for raw materials was high, and the finished product cost more than in other cities. In the 6th century, the Empire obtained sandalwood, aloes, and silk from Ceylon, as trade with India and Ethiopia was the main business in this part of the world. During this time, the Empire also traded for copper in Kalliana; raw material and labor came from the north. Though the Empire saw difficult times in the 7th century, trade continued. Food, commodities, and other items were sold at a fixed price to prevent rivals to the ruler and government, as specified in the first part of the constitution, which also allowed citizens to purchase basic necessities at a reasonable and affordable price. Another part sought to protect producers by eliminating a vertical monopoly.Browning p 107 Work was divided equally amongst all members, providing for a low competition rate. The third part of the constitution claims that private producers receive aid only from family members, although some might also have slaves to help in the business. Such businesses sold directly to customers, and they had fewer customers than other markets. The private producer produced items for himself and his family. During this time, Constantinople especially continued trade with Africa, while other Alexandrian ships began to reach places as far west as Britain. The Empire had laws on trade and sailing. One of them. which grew out of the custom of marine regulation,Baynes 218 restricted ships to sailing in the winter months. Sailing was later suspended for four months between November and March because of dangers such as pirates, land-based robbers, and ships being set on fire. Byzantine ships would sail together to give aid to each other, and they began to carry armed men for further protection. Another law declares that money lent for a vessel does not have to be returned if that vessel is lost or destroyed.Byanes p 219 The Byzantine Empire had a vast network of trade routes, and the government issued laws to protect merchants and businesses by providing route options for safety and protection.

The Tale of the Heike establish that Ogata commanded the largest armies on Ky≈´sh≈´. According to the Okuninushi no Mikoto line of Shinto legends, Saburo's great-great-grandfather was Daida, and thus Saburo was descended from a snake god. It is said that Daida's mother was visited each night by her lover. One night, she pinned a needle attached to a reel of thread on his kimono. The next day, she followed the thread to a cave. She heard mighty roars from within and called out to her lover, but he replied that his appearance was too frightening for her to behold. She remained persistent. Then, a great snake appeared with the needle attached to its throat. As soon as she laid her eyes on the snake, she and her companions scattered in terror. The following night, she gave birth to a son, Daida, who was raised by her grandfather in Bungo Province (now ≈åita Prefecture). The snake was thus the symbol of the Ogata clan under Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi. The Ogata clan's leader was originally a retainer of Taira no Shigemori. When the wars between the Taira and Minamoto began, Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi switched sides after the Minamoto killed his rival Kikuchi Jiro, and his armies played the key role in securing Minamoto no Yoritomo's control of Japan by expelling the Taira from Ky≈´sh≈´. It was Saburo who secured Prince Antoku and lead the main battle against the Taira at Dan-no-ura. He also helped to build the once famous Oka Castle for the first established sh≈çgun of Japan..

The smart card roll out was the first phase in the introduction of an integrated ticketing and fares system (Auckland Integrated Fares System, or \\"AIFS\\") that was rolled out across the region. The first iteration of the card ‚Äì commonly referred to as the \\"purple HOP card\\" ‚Äì was discontinued in 2012 because of issues with the delivery of key technologies. The current card, called the AT HOP card, is in use on all ferry, train and bus services in Auckland. The rollout of the card to all three transport modes was completed in March 2014.  Card operation  The AT HOP card is a dark blue credit-card-sized stored- value contactless smartcard that can hold prepaid funds (called HOP Money) to pay for fares or for monthly passes for unlimited travel within one or more of three \\"transport zones\\". Either facility must be added to the card before travel. Passengers \\"tag on\\" and \\"tag off\\" their card on electronic terminals when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds. Cards may be \\"topped-up\\" or monthly passes purchased in the following ways: online, at ticket machines, at ticketing offices, and at selected retail outlets such as bookshops. Top ups may be made by credit or debit card, with the latter three mediums accepting cash payment. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of paper tickets. Usage is encouraged by offering cheaper fares than the cash ticket option, although there is an initial once-only fee to purchase the card. Monthly and/or multiple trip travel is only available with the AT HOP card. The card can be used only for fare payments and only on Auckland Transport routes; it cannot be used to pay for refreshments or other items. It cannot be used to pay for travel on the Northern Explorer passenger train running between Auckland and Wellington or on inter-city bus services. The AT HOP cards are based on near field communication (NFC) with DESFire with support of 3DES and AES, enabling 168‚Äì128 bit keys. This encryption give card holders the ability to not have their card simply cloned. History In 2008, the Auckland Regional Transport Authority announced its intentions to develop an integrated ticketing system for the region's public transport services, called the Auckland Integrated Fares System (AIFS). An initial system developed with a consortium including the French Thales Group and New Zealand- based Snapper Services was announced in 2010, however subsequent difficulties with the development of technologies for the system saw the termination of Auckland Transport's agreement with Snapper. The council-controlled organisation confirmed Thales would be contracted with ongoing development of the system across the entirety of the region's transport network. =HOP/Snapper card debacle= Snapper Services Ltd, a subsidiary of Infratil, made a joint bid with ANZ, New Zealand Post, Eyede, Unisys and Beca Group for the contract of developing Auckland's integrated ticketing system. However, the contract was awarded to the Thales Group. Snapper lodged a complaint, later dismissed, questioning the legitimacy of the tender process.The first iteration of the HOP card supplied by Snapper could be used on NZ Bus services only. Snapper announced in late-2009 that it would begin rolling out its Snapper card onto NZ Bus services (but no other Auckland bus company or service), in spite of the Auckland Regional Transport Authority-Thales integrated ticketing arrangement. In response, the Auckland Regional Transport Authority called the Snapper announcement \\"premature\\" citing the development of ARTA's integrated ticketing offering still in development with Thales and confirming that all public transport operators in Auckland, including NZ Bus, would be required to participate in ARTA's system. Replacing the Auckland Regional Transport Authority in 2010, Auckland Transport announced it had invited Snapper to work with the council-controlled organisation and Thales on the ticketing system. Auckland Transport confirmed Snapper would develop a contactless smart card and supply buses with ticketing terminals that would support the Thales developed back-end, to be rolled out initially on NZ Bus services and later on ferry and train services in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011. In April 2011, Auckland Transport announced the \\"HOP card\\", developed by Snapper, with initial rollout on all NZ Bus services. This iteration of the \\"HOP card\\" was met with initial confusion as to its capabilities and the extent of Auckland Transport's integration with Snapper and Snapper's pre- existing infrastructure, which included the ability to make minor transactions with merchants and retailers. Concerns were also raised as to the ability of Auckland's ticketing system to work with Snapper cards used on Wellington's transport network and vice versa, with Auckland Transport later instructing NZ Bus drivers not to accept the Wellington implementation of the Snapper card. Auckland Transport subsequently announced in early-2012 that bus passengers would be required to \\"swap out\\" their HOP/Snapper cards for a new integrated ticketing card, also called \\"HOP\\", as the Snapper offering would not be supported on ferries, trains and on some bus services. Snapper faced difficulties in developing its technology to work with the Thales system, with Thales' New Zealand chief executive citing that the \\"failure of Snapper to deliver a functional bus system that meets the ratified standard has caused delays to project go-live\\". Snapper's \\"failure\\" to meet the November 30 deadline imposed by Auckland Transport ultimately led to the organisation severing its relationship with Snapper, citing \\"concerns about whether Snapper could modify its system in a suitable timeframe\\". Snapper maintained it was \\"wrongly blamed\\" for the delays, declaring ‚ÄúAuckland Transport is being disingenuous with its attempt to position Snapper as the reason that the [integrated ticketing] project is delayed.\\" Auckland Transport confirmed it had commissioned Thales to provide the new iteration of the \\"HOP\\" smart card ‚Äì called \\"AT HOP\\" ‚Äì and its ticketing terminals, replacing the HOP/Snapper offering on NZ Bus services and introducing the new card onto ferries, trains and all other bus services. = Launch = AT HOP pilot cardThe current blue 'AT HOP card' began rolling out on public transport, starting with the rail network on 28 October 2012. The rollout for all Auckland bus, train and ferry services was completed by March 2014. Spark (then Telecom) had trialed a 'virtual AT HOP card' on Android phones with NFC and intended it for release in late 2013. = Post-launch operation = A fee of 25 cents for each top up was abolished in July 2014. In September 2016, it was reported that the one millionth AT Hop card had been sold, and that 42 per cent of Auckland adults had a card as of June 2016. The contract with the Thales Group runs until 2021. Auckland Transport has the option to extend the contract to 2026. The expectation is that in 2026, Auckland will implement Project NEXT, an open- loop account-based public transport payment system proposed for New Zealand. With Auckland joining Project NEXT, implementation of this system across the country should be completed, meaning that from then on, the whole country will use the same system.

He is the author of a famous 1424 portolan chart, the first known to depict the Antillia island group (Antillia, Satanazes, Royllo and Tanmar), a cluster of legendary islands in the north Atlantic Ocean.  Background  Little is known of Zuane Pizzigano, save that he was probably a relative (possibly a descendant) of the Venetian cartographers Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano, who made a famous 1367 portolan chart.  1424 chart  Zuane Pizzigano is the author of the influential 1424 portolan chart, known simply as the \\"Pizzigano Map\\", measuring . The map was first discovered in 1953, among the thousands of manuscripts in the library of the noted collector Sir Thomas Phillipps.Its discovery was announced in Cortes√£o (1953). For Phillips' history, see Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.): p.3). It is currently held by the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, USA. (B1424mPi) Identification of the author is not certain. The legend on the 1424 map reads: Mccccxxiiij adi xxij auosto Zuane pizzi..... afato questa carta (\\"1424 on 22 August, Zuane Pizzi..... made this map\\"), with the part after the last name \\"Pizzi\\" smudged, seemingly tracing an attempt to erase and then restore the author's name. The smudged space, under infrared light, does seem to reveal something like \\"pizzigano\\".Cortes√£o (1954 (1975): p.28) Zuane is a common Venetian variant of Giovanni' (John). While his name is uncertain, the date is not. Comparison with later maps of the 15th century shows that other cartographers had copied Pizzigano in several important respects, so his work was significant. = Features = The 1424 Pizzigano map is a nautical portolan chart that is limited to western Europe, northwest Africa, and a large swathe of the north Atlantic Ocean. He featured both real and mythical islands in the outer area. The map has notes in Venetian and Portuguese. Although the drawing is rudimentary, the Canary islands are depicted near completeness, with eight known islands indicatedIdentifications of the islands are as given in Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.): p.23)--alegranzia (Alegranza), larozio (Roque del Este), lancarot (blue with red stripe, rather than the usual Genoese shield, an understandable variation for a Venetian author), louos (Lobos Island), fortubentura/fortouentura (Fuerteventura), canaria (Gran Canaria), inferno (Tenerife), and a long distance to the west, balmar (La Palma). It is significantly missing La Gomera and El Hierro (which had already been shown in earlier maps). Pizzigano indicates a mysterious large red island, with four outlying islets, to the south of the Canaries archipelago, which he identifies as himadoro. This may represent the mythical Saint Brendan's Island.Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.): p.23; p.83) considers the possibility that himadoro may be a prescient depiction of the Cape Verde islands. The Madeira Islands, officially recently discovered in 1418-1420 by the Portuguese, are also depicted, with the names accurately given: madera (Madeira), portosanto (Porto Santo, dexrexta (Desertas) and saluazes (Savage Islands).Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.): p.23 This showed that the results of exploration were being rapidly shared among the seagoing nations and their cartographers. More surprising is Pizzigano's depiction of what appears to be the Azores archipelago further north, as these islands were not officially discovered by the Portuguese until 1431 or possibly 1427 at the earliest. Earlier maps had also sometimes featured such Atlantic islands (e.g. the Catalan Atlas of 1375), with names partially taken from ancient European sources. According to Cortes√£o's tentative 20th-century identification, in the 1424 Pizzigano map, these islands are denoted as the following:lubrioczo (S√£o Jorge), ixola de uentula (Faial), ixo de braxil (Terceira), capiria (S√£o Miguel) and louo (Santa Maria).Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.): p.23). Cortes√£o (p.91) speculates the Azores might have been inadvertently found by Nicoloso da Recco on his return from the famous 1341 mapping expedition that \\"discovered\\" the Canary islands. = Antillia group = The mythical Antillia island group, as depicted by Zuane Pizzigano, 1424 The most famous islands of the 1424 Pizzigano map are the Antillia group of four islands in the middle of Atlantic Ocean, west of the putative Azores, because he was the first known cartographer to depict them. The group is dominated by two very large rectangular-shaped islands: the large red Antilia (in Pizzigano's label, ista ixolla dixeno antilia) and, some sixty leagues north of it, the large blue Satanazes (ista ixolla dixemo satanazes, the Satanaxio/Satanagio/Salvagio of later maps). Some twenty leagues west of the great Antilia is the small blue Ymana (the 'Royllo' of later maps), while the Santanazes is capped to the north by the semi-circular red Saya (the 'Tanmar' or 'Danmar' of later maps). Historians have speculated that Pizzigano's depiction of the Antilia group on his 1424 map is based on accounts of possible pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact with the Americas. But, the basis of his depiction is not known for certain. For a time, historians thought he may have based the island group on a suggestive inscription in the 1367 map of the Pizzigani brothers (his relatives, possibly his father), but that interpretation has since been discarded.Cortes√£o (1954 (1975): p.106) It is largely agreed that Zuane Pizzigano is the first known cartographer to depict the legendary Antilia group on a map. The name of the main island, Antillia, is believed to be derived from the Portuguese term ante-ilha (\\"opposite island\\", that is, facing Portugal). It is derived from an old Iberian legend, relating how seven Visigothic bishops, fleeing the Muslim conquest of Hispania in 714, embarked with their flock on ships and fled across the Atlantic to erect a new home on this island. Pizzigano, as many others after him, attempted to depict and name the seven settlements on the island; thus it is also known as the \\"island of Seven Cities\\".For a list of names from various charts, see Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.) p.140) The source of Satanazes (the \\"Isle of Devils\\" in Portuguese), to the north of Antillia, is more uncertain. This island may represent elements of the Norse sagas of Greenland and Vinland, which had begun to filter South around this time; the indigenous Skraelings in these accounts would be the 'devils' implied in the island's name.Cortes√£o, p. 136-37 The Ymana to the west of Antilia is possibly a transcription of Ynsula Mam, the legendary Isle of Mam, first depicted in 1367 by the Pizzigani brothers.Cortes√£o, p. 145 'Saya' is more obscure. Whatever his source, Zuane Pizzigano mapped the Antillia group of islands; his number of islands, sizes, shapes and positions, were all subsequently copied almost exactly by most cartographers during the 15th century--notably, Battista Beccario (1435), Andrea Bianco (1436), Grazioso Benincasa (1462, 1470, 1482), etc. down to the 1492 Erdapfel globe of Martin Behaim.For an exhaustive list, see Armando Cortes√£o (1954 (1975 ed.): p.156).Seaver, Kirsten A. (2004) Maps, Myths and Men Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. p.75 Thrower, Norman Joseph William (1999) Maps & Civilization: Cartography in Culture and Society, Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago Press, . p66 Pizzigano's 1424 map includes two other legendary islands: the tri-colored circular island of braxil, located just west of Ireland, is believed to represent the mythical Brasil, which had already been shown in earlier maps. Southwest of that, around half-way to the Antilia group, lies a semi-circular blue island denoted ixola de uentura. It is located near the area where the Pizzigani brothers first depicted the legendary Isle of Mam in 1367, and it may have been Z. Pizzigano's intention to duplicate that.Cortes√£o, p. 136 However, identifying uentura with Mam would leave Ymana unresolved. One possibility is that the ixola de ventura is related to the Illa Verde (\\"Green Island\\", a reference to Greenland). Filtered from Norse or Irish sources, this was sometimes represented on contemporary maps, and perhaps was already known to Iberian fishermen.Babcock (1922: ch.7, p.94) Notes  Sources  * Babcock, W.H.

It is situated 5 km north of the Hearne Channel of Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, approximately 100 kilometers east-southeast of the capital city of Yellowknife. Geologically located on the Canadian Shield it is mostly composed of peralkaline syenite (granitic rock with low quartz content). The Blatchford Lake complex was created in the early Proterozoic, 2.14 Ga ago. The deposit is divided in several sub-structures. In a small zone at the northern edge of the syenite, the T-Zone, minerals like bastn√§site, phenakite and xenotime can be found. Within the Mackenzie mining district, Thor Lake may contain some of the largest deposits of light and heavy rare- earth element (REE) ores. The major elements of these ores are europium, terbium, dysprosium, neodymium, gallium, niobium, thorium, zirconium and beryllium. A significant proportion of the REE deposits lie within the boundaries of the Nechalacho Rare Earth Element Project, funded by Avalon Rare Metals.

Plot In New York City, a news report is broadcast informing the world that a mission to stop an incoming 70-mile wide asteroid known as \\"Matilda\\" has failed and that the asteroid will make impact in three weeks, destroying all life on Earth. Dodge Petersen (Steve Carell) and his wife, Linda (Nancy Carell), listen to the broadcast from the side of the road. When Dodge expresses disinterest, Linda disgustedly leaves the vehicle without a word. At home, Dodge reminisces about his high school sweetheart, Olivia, when he notices his neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) crying on the fire escape. She has just broken up with her boyfriend Owen (Adam Brody) for making her miss her last opportunity to see her family in England. At her apartment, Penny gives Dodge three years' worth of his mail that was incorrectly delivered to her and, in the process, unwittingly tells him that his wife was having an affair. Dodge storms off into the night, guzzling codeine-laced cough syrup and window cleaner in a suicide attempt. He wakes up in a park, with a dog tethered to his foot and a note on his sweater reading \\"Sorry\\", which becomes the dog's name. Dodge takes Sorry home, opens the old mail, and is surprised to discover a three-month-old letter from Olivia, which explains that he was \\"the love of her life.\\" Later, a riot breaks out on his block. Dodge and Penny abandon the self-centered Owen amid the rioters, with Dodge explaining to Penny that he knows someone who could fly her to England if she helps him find Olivia. She agrees, and the two set off with Sorry for Dodge's hometown in Delaware. Along the way, Dodge and Penny run out of gas, share a bizarre experience with suicidal motorist Glenn (William Petersen), witness the eruption of an orgy at a restaurant, have sex in a pick-up truck, and spend a night in jail. They get a ride to Camden, New Jersey, where they meet Penny's ex-boyfriend, Speck (Derek Luke), who is prepared for the apocalypse. Speck has a working satellite phone in his bunker and lets Penny contact her family. Penny and Dodge borrow a car from Speck and eventually make it to Olivia's family home. Dodge and Penny walk up toward the door of the home but find no one home and then spend the day together; they realize a mutual affection. Penny discovers a letter from Olivia to her parents, which reveals Olivia's address. Penny and Dodge drive to Olivia's home, where Dodge leaves a letter to Olivia and expresses his feelings for Penny. Later, they go to the house of the man who Dodge promised could take Penny to England. The man turns out to be Dodge's estranged father, Frank (Martin Sheen). After making amends with Frank, Dodge puts a sleeping Penny into his father's plane, whispering to her that she is the real love of his life. Frank and Penny depart, leaving Dodge behind. Dodge takes refuge in Penny's apartment and awaits his imminent death until Penny unexpectedly returns, upset that Dodge allowed her to leave. The two lie in bed and comfort each other as they feel the tremor of the asteroid's impact. Penny expresses regret at not having met Dodge sooner, while Dodge assures her that their meeting had been opportune. Penny smiles as everything fades to white.

Miller as Darcy * Amy Schumer as Lacey * Jim O'Heir as Sheriff * Martin Sheen as Frank Petersen * Nancy Carell as Linda Petersen * Roger Aaron Brown as Alfred * Aleister Hundgen-Kazlauskas as Sorry Production Lorene Scafaria wanted to \\"tell the story of boy meets girl with a really ticking clock\\", prompted by recent events in her own life, including a \\"death in the family, a breakup, and a new relationship.\\" Scafaria also took inspiration from her experience during the September 11 attacks. Having recently moved from New York to Los Angeles, the attacks left her feeling \\"stranded\\" and so she ended up getting in contact with old friends. Later, she commented that she \\"found it interesting that this cataclysmic event would have such an effect on my own human behavior and relationships.\\" In terms of movies Scafaria found inspiration in films such as 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. The story, specifically that of an \\"unexpected romance blossoming between two strangers while on an impromptu road trip\\", shares similarities to that of her previous screenplay, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, and it was while titling the previous movie that she thought, \\"What if you took forever off the table?\\" Scafaria said that Adam Brody helped her with the script, giving her a male perspective to the soundtrack. It was the first movie filmed after ending his seven-year run on The Office. Carrell's character's wife was played by his actual wife. The scene where she dumps him was filmed on their 17th wedding anniversary; the director got them a cake and the crew sang Happy Anniversary. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the cast, particularly Knightley and Carell. According to Rotten Tomatoes, \\"tender, charming, and well-acted, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is unfortunately hamstrung by jarring tonal shifts and a disappointing final act\\" with 55% of critics giving it a positive rating, based on 172 reviews. On Metacritic the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on reviews from 36 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a positive review and said, \\"The best parts of this sweet film involve the middle stretches, when time, however limited, reaches ahead, and the characters do what they can to prevail in the face of calamity. How can I complain that they don't entirely succeed? Isn't the dilemma of the plot the essential dilemma of life?\\" Joe Neumaier, of the New York Daily News, said that the film was \\"One of the year's most emotionally affecting movies.\\" Film critic Nathan Heller wrote in Vogue magazine that the script was \\"desperately in need of a good edit\\" and commended the performances of Knightley and Carell: \\"Carell and, more surprisingly, Knightley are comedians proficient enough to sell the banter.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety magazine wrote: \\"The end of the world can't come fast enough in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, a disastrously dull take on the disaster-movie formula.\\" The film performed poorly on its opening weekend, earning only $3 million, but managed to debut at Number 4 on the UK Box Office for the week ending July 15, 2012. The film earned a worldwide total of $9.6 million against a production budget of $10 million.

For many decades it was the only African-American neighborhood in the city. It is located south of Downtown West and north of Glen Park along Broadway, Gary's principal thoroughfare. It adjoins the neighborhoods of Tolleston to the west and Pulaski to the east. As of 2000, Midtown had a population of 12,056. The Midtown neighborhood began as a community of poor white ethnic millworkers, who were excluded from the more upscale neighborhoods close to the Gary Works. Significant African American immigration began after World War I; the neighborhood remained integrated for a time, but gradually the whites moved out as housing became available elsewhere, while the blacks were kept in Midtown by segregationist city ordinances. The neighborhood's white population dropped from 25% in 1940 to 4% in 1950. In the 1950 census, Midtown accounted for 97% of Gary's black population. Prior to desegregation, Midtown was a largely self-contained African-American community: because blacks were largely excluded from Downtown Gary, most retail activity was kept within the neighborhood. Coney Island on 25th & Broadway During the Richard Hatcher administration in the 1960s and 1970s, Midtown was targeted for urban renewal, and thousands of substandard homes were demolished. Today Midtown's housing stock is a mixture of single-family and multi-family homes, including a number of affordable housing developments. As of 2000, the owner-occupancy rate was 36.6%. Commercial activity is concentrated along Broadway and Grant streets. The neighborhood was served by the W.E.B. DuBois branch of the Gary Public Library until it was consolidated with the main branch, and also has its own post office. Public transportation is provided by buses of the Gary Public Transportation Corporation running along Broadway. The neighborhood is the site of Theodore Roosevelt High School. Famous people from Midtown include the musicians of the Jackson family, such as Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. Other noted Midtown residents include educator Ida B. King. The neighborhood also hosted many jazz and blues musicians during the segregation period.

Awarded a piano scholarship to the Eastman School of Music, he soon became a composition major. At Eastman, he studied with Howard Hanson and Bernard Rogers, earning bachelor's (1938) and master's (1940) degrees in composition. He undertook additional studies with Quincy Porter, Roy Harris and, at the first composition class at the Tanglewood Music Center in 1940, with Aaron Copland.Salvatore, p. 22 =Early career= Palmer came to national attention in an article titled \\"Robert Palmer and Charles Mills\\" published in 1943 by critic Paul Rosenfeld in Modern Music.Rosenfeld, pp. 264-265 Rosenfeld hails two \\"new, impressive, distinctive works\\" by Palmer,\\" noting \\"an impression of robustness and maturity.\\" In the Concerto for Small Orchestra (1940), Rosenfeld discerns a \\"quite original opening movement, (whose) clash of melodies in contrary motion was magnificent and fierce,\\" signaling \\"a new composer to be watched with happy expectation.\\" Further national attention came with the publication in 1948 by Aaron Copland of an article in the New York Times titled \\"The New 'School' of American Composers.\\" Copland's article singles out Palmer as one of seven composers \\"representative of some of the best we have to offer the new generation,\\" adding that \\"Palmer happens to be one of my own particular enthusiasms.\\"Copland In Palmer's first two string quartets, Copland discerns \\"separate movements of true originality and depth of feeling,\\" observing that \\"always his music has urgency‚Äîit seems to come from some inner need for expression.\\" Early in his career, Palmer taught music theory, composition and piano at the University of Kansas from 1940 until 1943. =Later career = From 1943 until his retirement in 1980, Palmer served as a member of the faculty at Cornell University, where he was appointed Given Foundation Professor of Music in 1976. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Steven Stucky, Chair of the Board of Directors of the American Music Center and a former Palmer student, \\"(Palmer) founded the doctoral program in music composition at Cornell University, which was the first in the United States (and quite possibly the world).\\"\\"Remembering Robert Moffat Palmer (1915-2010)\\" Writing in Clavier magazine in 1989, pianist Ramon Salvatore observed that \\"[Palmer's] influence on two generations of Cornell composers has been enormous; many of his former students now hold university and college professorships throughout the United States\\" Additionally, Palmer served as visiting composer at Illinois Wesleyan University in 1954 and as the George A. Miller Professor of Composition at the University of Illinois in 1955-56. Many of Palmer's most distinctive works date from his Cornell period. Steven Stucky remarks that Palmer \\"once seemed poised to become a leading national figure. A steady stream of first-rate pieces attracted top performers in concert and on recordings: the Second Piano Sonata (1942; 1948), championed by John Kirkpatrick; Toccata Ostinato (1945), a boogie-woogie in 13/8 written for pianist William Kapell; the first Piano Quartet (1947); the Chamber Concerto No. 1 (1949); the Quintet for Clarinet, Piano, and Strings (1952). Most influential of these was the mighty Piano Quartet, which used to loom large as one of the major accomplishments of American chamber music.\\" Echoing this assessment, Robert Evett, in a review written in 1970 for the Washington Evening Star of Palmer's first Piano Quartet (1947), found it \\"one of the most engrossing works of a superb American composer. ... At its premiere, it was a triumph. It was a triumph again last night.\\"quoted by Ewen, p. 488 Palmer's publishers include Elkan-Vogel, Peer International, C. F. Peters Corporation, G. Schirmer Inc., Valley Music Press, and Alphonse Leduc-Robert King, Inc. Palmer's students include Pulitzer Prize-winning composers Steven Stucky and Christopher Rouse and composers Paul Chihara, Bernhard Heiden, Brian Israel, Ben Johnston, David Conte, John S. Hilliard, Leonard Lehrman, Daniel Dorff, Jerry Amaldev, James Marra, Harris Lindenfeld, and Jack Gallagher. Style and reception Elliott Carter, writing for Modern Music about an early-1940s League of Composers performance of Palmer's String Quartet No. 1 (1939), reported that \\"Palmer, a hitherto unheard-from composer, was the big surprise of the whole concert series. His music is firm and definite; its dissonance resembles that of younger Europeans whom we never hear in this country... His quartet showed an impressive seriousness and great musicality.\\" William Austin, writing in 1956 in The Musical Quarterly, observes that \\"through recordings and published scores... [Palmer's] fairly large but scattered audience can now confirm the predictions of Paul Rosenfeld and Aaron Copland that Palmer would rank among the leading musical representatives of his generation.\\"Austin, \\"The Music of Robert Palmer\\", p.35 Austin notes \\"the works [Palmer] creates are taut and sturdy\\" and cites as characteristic Palmer's use of asymmetrical rhythm and meter, the octatonic scale, \\"imitative counterpoint\\" and \\"expansion of phrases by varied repetition.\\" Austin holds that \\"Palmer sings with a kind of devout serenity\\" of the \\"grim, divided, disappointed world of the 1940s and '50s, doggedly refusing to despair, no matter how often its hopes for liberty, equality and fraternity must be deferred. . . His best music ranks with the best means available for all who share this outlook.\\"Austin, \\"The Music of Robert Palmer\\", p. 48 The previous year (1955), Herbert Livingston described the premiere performance of Palmer's String Quartet No. 3 at the University of Michigan as \\"the most recent addition to the distinguished series of works commissioned by the University for the Stanley Quartet (others cited by Livingston included quartets and quintets by Walter Piston, Quincy Porter, Wallingford Riegger, Darius Milhaud, and Heitor Villa-Lobos). It is both a significant contribution to the repertory of contemporary American chamber music and a work that reveals new developments in the composer's style.\\"Livingston, p. 511 Livingston adds, \\"every refinement of its complex structure contributes positively to the expressiveness of the music.\\"Livingston, p. 514 The premiere performance in 1963 of Palmer's oratorio, Nabuchodonosor, lasting 40 minutes, was greeted by The Musical Quarterly's William C. Holmes as \\"a culminating point in Robert Palmer's more than twenty-five years as an active composer... It is his largest and most ambitiously conceived work to date. It is a forceful, rough- hewn cry of defiance against tyranny in all forms and, as such, cannot help but move anyone who shares Palmer's views on this subject.\\"Holmes, p. 367 Holmes takes note of \\"the exciting forcefulness that carries one with it to the climax\\" and of the coda that follows‚Äîintended, says Holmes, \\"to convey a serene greeting of peace to mankind.\\"Holmes, p. 370 Arthur Cohn, surveying four works by Palmer in The Literature of Chamber Music (1997), detects \\"brilliant contrapuntalism\\" in Palmer's \\"vitally communicative music.\\" Cohn notes that \\"in Palmer's hands repetition is always paralleled by change\\" and finds \\"positive tonalism, broadened and colored by contemporary expansion\\" in the music of \\"this American composer of virile voice.\\"Cohn, pp. 2068-2069 In a eulogy written in 2010 for the American Music Center, AMC Chair of the Board of Directors and former Palmer student Steven Stucky noted that \\"Austin captures the grave lyricism that makes Palmer memorable, but no less important was his lively rhythmic language, which owed a debt in equal parts to American vernacular music, jazz, and Renaissance polyphony.\\" Stucky concludes that \\"Palmer's music is ripe for rediscovery by a wider public, and it lives on in those who knew him, and those who celebrate him now for a life well and generously lived.\\" According to Daniel Aioi, Palmer's \\"body of work resides at Cornell in the Sidney Cox Library of Music and Dance and in the University Archives in Olin Library.\\"Aioi, 2010 Commissioned works * Concerto for Small Orchestra (1940); commissioned by CBS and the League of Composers * Second String Quartet (1943; rev. 1947); commissioned by the Sergei Koussevitzky Music Foundation * Variations, Chorale and Fugue for orchestra (1947; rev. 1954); commissioned by Dimitri Mitropoulos and the Minneapolis Symphony * Quintet for Piano and Strings (1950); commissioned by the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation * Quintet for Clarinet, Piano and Strings (1952; rev. 1953); commissioned by the Quincy, Illinois Chamber Music Society * String Quartet No. 3 (1954); commissioned by the Stanley Foundation of the University of Michigan * Of Night and the Sea (1956); commissioned by the Paul Fromm Music Foundation * Memorial Music (1960); commissioned by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters * Centennial Overture (1965); commissioned by Cornell University and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts * Quartet No. 2 for Piano and Strings (1974); commissioned by the Galzio Quartet, Caracas, Venezuela * Piano Sonata No. 3 (1979); commissioned by Ramon Salvatore * Cello Sonata No. 2 (1983); commissioned by the Hans Kindler Foundation, Washington, DC Notable performances * Piano Sonata No. 1 (1938) premiered March 26, 1940 in New York by pianist John Kirkpatrick * Concerto for Small Orchestra (1940) premiered in 1941 by the CBS Orchestra * Toccata Ostinato (1944) for piano commissioned,Salvatore, p. 24 premiered,Austin, \\"The Music of Robert Palmer\\", p. 49 dedicated to and recordedMP3 download at Rhapsody.com.

It premiered on February 28, 2011, consisting of some programs simulcast from radio station Super Radyo DZBB 594 in the form of its live video feed. The program is streaming on YouTube. History Original titlecard from February 28, 2011 to September 7, 2012 In 2011, DZBB began its simulcast on television with the launch of Dobol B sa News TV block, coinciding with the inauguration of GMA News TV. Originally, the block included the radio station's top-rated programs such as Saksi sa Dobol B and Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide. However, it ended its simulcast on September 7, 2012. It was replaced in the interim by Pinoy Cine Klasika, a movie block showing Filipino monochrome films of the 1950s and eventually Kape at Balita. On April 24, 2017, Dobol B sa News TV returned on GMA News TV after a 5-year hiatus, this time simulcasting DZBB's entire morning drive-time programming, coinciding with the launch of the station's new jingle and unveiling of its renovated radio studio. The original programs Saksi sa Dobol B and Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide returned to the network, with DZBB's mid-morning shows Sino? (with segments Jeng-Jeng and Balitawit) and Dobol A sa Dobol B added on the said block. In 2018, Saksi sa Dobol B's timeslot was reduced due to the medical leave of Mike Enriquez, with the Sino? segment now becoming a stand-alone program with the 9:00 - 9:30am slot taken over by a new program, Anong Say Nyo? which debuted early in the year. On April 24, 2019, ZOE Broadcasting Network and GMA / Citynet announced that the blocktime agreement between their networks was not going to be renewed. This effectively ended their partnership and lease blocktime on VHF Channel 11 after almost 14 years. As a result, Channel 27 was re-utilized to broadcast GMA News TV on June 4, 2019, after 18 years of dormancy. With this transfer, Dobol B sa News TV block extended its airtime until midday (6:00 AM-12:00 NN, filling the timeslot of News to Go and the first 30 minutes of Balitanghali). Additionally, the block also started airing into the weekend beginning on the same day. The revamped lineup included new programs as well as existing Super Radyo programs that have not been aired on the block before. On January 13, 2020, Dobol B sa News TV extended its airtime as an emergency measure for the first time to cover the eruption of Taal Volcano in Batangas (albeit Balitanghali aired on its usual noontime slot). from March 19 to 20, 2020, GMA News TV was put off air in line with the enhanced community quarantine imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dobol B sa News TV's Melo del Prado sa Super Radyo DZBB aired temporarily on GMA Network on these days alongside the main channel's Unang Hirit. GNTV returned to broadcasting (albeit on a truncated 12-14 hour daily operation) on March 21, with the expanded edition of Dobol B sa News TV (along with DZBB's simulcast of 24 Oras) airing into the evening as its sole program. As a part of the skeletal protocol, Dobol B now includes the afternoon programs from the station that have never been simulcast on TV. Additionally, on March 23, 2020, the 6:00-8:45 am timeslot of the block begun simulcasting on its VHF sister station as Dobol B sa GMA as a skeletal measure, temporarily displacing Unang Hirit (the full hour of Saksi sa Dobol B can be watched on GMA News TV instead). That arrangement ended on April 8, giving way to the return of the Unang Hirit broadcasts 5 days later. On August 10, 2020, the production of Dobol B sa News TV temporarily moved from the DZBB radio booth to GMA Network Center Studio 2, which was the home of GNTV-produced newscast Balitanghali and News TV Live bulletin before it on- halted productions in March. On September 7, the block adjusted its starting time to 5:30 AM to align with Melo del Prado sa Super Radyo DZBB. The aforementioned program formerly started at 5:30AM exclusively on DZBB-AM before simulcasting to News TV at 6:00 AM, however, its weekend edition would remain on the 6:00AM timeslot. On September 12 and 13, 2020, the program returned to DZBB booth temporarily. On September 19, 2020, Dobol B sa News TV made some changes in editions, schedules and timeslots following the resumption of several in-house programs of GMA News TV. On that day, it shorten its airtime from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm, giving way to the earlier timeslot of GMA Regional TV Weekend News on Saturdays; On September 20, the timeslot remain unchanged on Sundays; and On September 21, it was split into morning (5:30 am to 12:00 nn) and afternoon (4:00 pm to 6:30 pm) editions, due to Balitanghali and News TV Quick Response Team returning on air after 6 months of ceased production due to the COVID-19 pandemic on weekdays. On September 27, its Sunday edition was shorten to just three hours (6:00 am to 9:00 am), similar to the previous weekday schedule from its first incarnation, due to GMA's Astig Authority anime block would be aired on the said network beginning on the same day. On September 28, its weekday morning edition was reverted back to 11:00 am (previously from 2017‚Äì2019, on its current incarnation), due to early and extend airtime broadcast of Balitanghali beginning at 11:00 am to 12:30 pm. On October 3, its Saturday edition adjusted its starting time to 5:30 am to align with Super Radyo Nationwide and reverted back to 12:00 nn (previously from 2019‚Äì2020, on its current incarnation), due to extended airing of Sine Dates Weekends, and early broadcasts of GMA Regional TV Weekend News (at 4:30 pm) and 24 Oras Weekend (at 5:30 pm). On October 4, its Sunday edition adjusted its starting time to 5:30 am to align with Buena Manong Balita.

Therefore, it has an important function. WH1 domains are found on WASP proteins, which are often involved in actin polymerization. Hence, WH1 is important for all cellular processes involving actin, this includes cell motility, cell trafficking, cell division and cytokinesis, cell signalling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Interactions The WASP protein family control actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex. WASP is defective in Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome (WAS) whereby in most patient cases, the majority of point mutations occur within the N-terminal WH1 domain. The metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1alpha and mGluR5 bind a protein called homer, which is a WH1 domain homologue. A subset of WH1 domains has been termed the EVH1 domain and appear to bind a polyproline motif. The EVH1 (WH1, RanBP1-WASP) domain is found in multi-domain proteins implicated in a diverse range of signalling, nuclear transport and cytoskeletal events. This domain of around 115 amino acids is present in species ranging from yeast to mammals. Many EVH1-containing proteins associate with actin-based structures and play a role in cytoskeletal organisation. EVH1 domains recognise and bind the proline-rich motif FPPPP with low-affinity, further interactions then form between flanking residues. WASP family proteins contain an EVH1 (WH1) in their N-terminals which bind proline-rich sequences in the WASP interacting protein. Proteins of the RanBP1 family contain a WH1 domain in their N-terminal region, which seems to bind a different sequence motif present in the C-terminal part of RanGTP protein. Tertiary structure of the WH1 domain of the Mena protein revealed structure similarities with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The overall fold consists of a compact parallel beta-sandwich, closed along one edge by a long alpha-helix. A highly conserved cluster of three surface-exposed aromatic side-chains forms the recognition site for the molecules target ligands.  Examples  Human genes encoding proteins containing the WH1 domain include: * ENAH, EVL * HOMER1, HOMER2, HOMER3 * SPRED1, SPRED2, SPRED3 * VASP, WAS, WASL References External links  Category:Protein domains ","title":"WH1 domain"},{"id":"32027312","text":"Frank Heath (1907‚Äì1980) was a prominent Australian architect and planner of the mid twentieth century.

It was fought between the warlord Cao Cao and Yuan Shang, son and successor of Cao Cao's rival Yuan Shao, in the Yuan clan's headquarters Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Cao Cao had been allied with Yuan Shang's elder brother Yuan Tan, who rebelled in a succession feud, and it was by Yuan Tan's request that Cao Cao laid siege to Ye. The successful siege of the city dislodged Yuan Shang's power from Ji Province, and Cao Cao would later use the city of Ye as a major base of his military power. Background Yuan Shao, the powerful warlord of the north, had been decisively defeated by his southern neighbour Cao Cao in the Battle of Guandu in 200 and died two years later in frustration. Despite the defeat, the Yuan power bloc was by no means eliminated, for Yuan Shao was survived by his three sons Yuan Tan, Yuan Xi, and Yuan Shang; together with their cousin Gao Gan, the Yuan family still held on to the provinces of Ji, Qing, Bing, and You. The Yuan brothers were not on good terms, however‚ÄîYuan Tan, the oldest, contested the succession of his younger brother Yuan Shang, who was preemptively made heir by his supporters Shen Pei and Pang Ji, while the second son Yuan Xi was content with controlling the northernmost You Province and stayed out of his brothers' conflict. In the winter of 202, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Tan's position in Liyang, and Yuan Shang brought his troops to help his older brother. The two brothers held out for six months, before eventually driven back to Ye, where they successfully struck back and caused Cao Cao to withdraw for the time being. As soon as Cao Cao started to retreat in mid-203, the brothers' feud took a turn to the worse. Yuan Tan requested more troops and equipment so he could lead an army to pursue Cao Cao's men, but Yuan Shang refused, not wanting his brother to gain control of a bigger army. This act of distrust proved to be the last straw for Yuan Tan, as he rebelled from his younger brother and attacked the city of Ye in anger. Yuan Shang successfully defended Ye again and chased Yuan Tan 300 kilometers away to Nanpi, the seat of Bohai Commandery (Ê∏§Êµ∑ÈÉ°). Bohai was on the edge of the border with Qing Province, where Yuan Tan still held the title Inspector of that province; but while he could expect some aid from the base of his power, some of his own men rebelled against him, and the position was very insecure. So when Yuan Shang came to attack Nanpi, Yuan Tan fled south to Pingyuan, where he was again besieged. Here he was close to Cao Cao's Yan province, and his advisor Guo Tu suggested seeking help from Cao Cao. Guo Tu reasoned that Cao Cao's army would attack Ye, and while Yuan Shang was to return to save his capital, Yuan Tan could expect to take the lands to the north of Ye; and if Cao Cao was to be successful, Yuan Shang's power would be removed and the outstretched Cao Cao would retreat soon after, leaving Yuan Tan to gain control of the north and capable enough to make a stand against Cao Cao.Records of Heroes, cited in Biography of Xin Pi, Volume 25, Annotated Records of the Three Kingdoms; Original quote: ‰ªäÂ∞áËªçÂúãÂ∞èÂÖµÂ∞ëÔºåÁ≥ßÂå±Âã¢Âº±ÔºåÈ°ØÁî´‰πã‰æÜÔºå‰πÖÂâá‰∏çÊïµ„ÄÇÊÑö‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂèØÂëºÊõπÂÖ¨‰æÜÊìäÈ°ØÁî´„ÄÇÊõπÂÖ¨Ëá≥ÔºåÂøÖÂÖàÊîªÈÑ¥ÔºåÈ°ØÁî´ÈÇÑÊïë„ÄÇÂ∞áËªçÂºïÂÖµËÄåË•øÔºåËá™ÈÑ¥‰ª•ÂåóÁöÜÂèØËôúÂæó„ÄÇËã•È°ØÁî´ËªçÁ†¥ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÖµÂ•î‰∫°ÔºåÂèàÂèØÊñÇÂèñ‰ª•ÊãíÊõπÂÖ¨„ÄÇÊõπÂÖ¨ÈÅ†ÂÉëËÄå‰æÜÔºåÁ≥ßÈ§â‰∏çÁπºÔºåÂøÖËá™ÈÄÉÂéª„ÄÇÊØîÊ≠§‰πãÈöõÔºåË∂ôÂúã‰ª•ÂåóÁöÜÊàë‰πãÊúâÔºå‰∫¶Ë∂≥ËàáÊõπÂÖ¨ÁÇ∫Â∞çÁü£„ÄÇ‰∏çÁÑ∂Ôºå‰∏çË´ß„ÄÇ Yuan Tan would not agree at first, but later sent Xin Pi as an ambassador to seek an alliance with Cao Cao. Since his withdrawal from Ye, Cao Cao's policy on the Yuan brothers was to let them wear each other out while he dealt with their ally Liu Biao in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), and thus he was unsure what to make of the envoy.de Crespigny (2010), p. 213 Cao Cao's advisor Xun Yu, who long advocated settling the north before turning elsewhere, reasoned that Liu Biao was not ambitious enough to be a threat, and it was high time to reap the benefits of the Yuan family feud before the brothers reunite.de Crespigny (1996), p. 319 Cao Cao agreed, but he continued to put Jing Province first. Observing that Cao Cao was doubtful of Yuan Tan's sincerity in an alliance, Xin Pi spoke his mind: Cao Cao accepted this advice, and Xin Pi thus switched sides. By the end of the year 203, Cao Cao again led his army across the Yellow River to Liyang and cemented the alliance by marrying his son Cao Zheng (ÊõπÊï¥) with Yuan Tan's daughter. Yuan Shang indeed lifted the siege on Pingyuan and returned to guard Ye. With Yuan Tan's position safe, Cao Cao returned for the time being.de Crespigny (1996), p. 321 The battle =Laying siege to Ye= In the spring of 204 Cao Cao crossed the Yellow River again and, mindful of the logistical problems for him to operate north of the Yellow River, started several waterworks projects to ease the transportation of supplies. While these works were under way, Yuan Shang apparently thought it safe to renew his attack on Yuan Tan in Pingyuan again, and left his loyal supporter Shen Pei to defend Ye. Some within Yuan Shang's camp found his priorities questionable, so when Cao Cao indeed advanced on Ye some time around the second or third month, the city's defenders under Su You (ËòáÁî±) intended to rebel and capitulate Ye to Cao Cao. The scheme was discovered, its plotters suppressed by Shen Pei within the city, and Su You fled to Cao Cao. Now Cao Cao's army was at the gates of Ye. He had mounds erected and tunnels dug to lay siege to the city. Having done this, Cao Cao left the general Cao Hong to maintain the siege while he turned west in the fourth month to attack Yin Kai (Â∞πÊ•∑), a county magistrate under Yuan Shang who guarded the supply route from Bing Province. After storming Yin Kai's fortress Maocheng (ÊØõÂüé) at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, Cao Cao's army bypassed the defenses at Ye and defeated Ju Hu (Ê≤ÆÈµ†) in Handan, north of Ye. This development brought about more defections from Yuan Shang's county magistrates, and the local Heishan bandit lord Zhang Yan offered his assistance to Cao Cao.de Crespigny (1996), p. 325 By this time Ye was cut off from the south, west, and north, while Yuan Shang was at its east facing Yuan Tan. Cao Cao's army returned to the siege-lines of Ye in the fifth month. Shen Pei vigorously defended the city throughout the siege; he had dug trenches within the city of Ye to counter Cao Cao's tunnels, and dealt with dissension among his ranks. One of his officers, Feng Li (È¶ÆÁ¶Æ) opened a sally port to let the enemy in. Shen Pei found out and had boulders dropped into the opening, blocking the gates and killed the roughly 300 soldiers who entered. Only a few weeks after the siege mounds and tunnels were constructed, Cao Cao changed tactics and ordered them destroyed. In their place, a shallow moat 40 li long was dug surrounding the city. At first the moat was shallow enough to be crossed, so Shen Pei laughed when he saw it and paid it no heed. Then, in a single night, Cao Cao dug the trench further, 20 feet wide and 20 feet deep, drawing water from the nearby Zhang River to the west and encompassing the Yanpi Marsh (ÊôèÈôÇÊæ§) to the south and the Huan River to the east and north.de Crespigny (2010), pp. 179-180 The city became isolated, and by the beginning of autumn it was said that more than half in the city died of starvation.de Crespigny (1996), p. 325 and de Crespigny (2010), p. 216 =The arrival and repulsion of Yuan Shang= Some time in the summer Yuan Shang decided to abort his campaign against Yuan Tan and turned back to help defend his headquarters. Yuan Shang sent his Registrar (‰∏ªÁ∞ø) Li Fu (ÊùéÂ≠ö) ahead to notify the defenders that relief was coming. To avoid detection by the besiegers, Li Fu brought only three horsemen, broke his staff of authority, and traveled by night. When he reached Cao Cao's camps surrounding the city from the north, he styled himself as a disciplinary officer and went through the camps finding fault with the sentries and punishing them. In this fashion he passed through the eastern camps from the northern camps into the camps on the southern side, where Cao Cao's personal camp was. Turning west from here, he arrested the officers on picket duty, tied them up, then made a dash to the city walls. He called to the defenders above, and they drew him in by rope. The ecstatic defenders sounded the drums in celebration of Li Fu's arrival, and Cao Cao laughed when he was made known of Li Fu's exploits.de Crespigny (1996), p. 326 Li Fu was to return to relay Ye's situation to Yuan Shang. He realized that he could not use the same trick to get past the siege-lines and so conjured another ploy. He had Shen Pei arrange to have the old and weak sent out in the night to save food. During the night, several thousand people selected were sent away through three different gates, carrying white flags to surrender. Li Fu and his followers blended into the crowd and exited Ye by the northern gate, then escaped the surrounding camps from the northwest. Yuan Shang was glad to see Li Fu back, while Cao Cao clapped his hands and laughed again when he knew Li Fu escaped.Brief Account of the Wei Dynasty, cited in Biography of Jia Kui, Volume 15, Annotated Records of the Three Kingdoms Through the ruckus surrounding Li Fu's infiltration, Cao Cao's men knew that Yuan Shang was leading troops to relief Ye. Some of Cao Cao's officers were concerned that since Yuan Shang was coming home with Yuan Tan at his heels, Yuan Shang's soldiers would theoretically be on \\"death ground\\" (Ê≠ªÂú∞), where they would fight more fiercely to save themselves according to Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Cao Cao pointed out that he should indeed avoid battle with the reinforcements if Yuan Shang came on the main road from the east; but if Yuan Shang moved across to the northwestern hills, he would have friendly territory (Gao Gan's Bing province) behind him and his army would be easier to deal with.de Crespigny (2010), p. 330 Yuan Shang approached obliquely from the north, to the delight of Cao Cao. When his scouts told him Yuan Shang's army reached Handan, Cao Cao candidly announced to his generals \\"I already have Ji Province, did you know? You shall see soon.\\"Biography of Cao Man, cited in Chronicles of the Martial Emperor, Volume 1, Annotated Records of the Three Kingdoms; original quote: Â≠§Â∑≤ÂæóÂÜÄÂ∑ûÔºåË´∏ÂêõÁü•‰πã‰πéÔºü[...] Ë´∏ÂêõÊñπË¶ã‰∏ç‰πÖ‰πü„ÄÇ From the western hills, Yuan Shang turned east to Yangping village (ÈôΩÂπ≥‰∫≠), 17 li from Ye. On the bank of the Fu River (ÊªèÊ∞¥) flowing north of the city, the relief army set camp and lit torches to signal the defenders for a coordinated attack, who lit another fire in acknowledgement. Shen Pei made a sortie to the north to rendezvous with Yuan Shang, but Cao Cao defeated both armies, driving Shen Pei back within the walls and Yuan Shang to Quzhang (Êõ≤Êº≥), a bend on the Zhang River. Cao Cao then moved to surround Yuan Shang's position, but before the encirclement was completed, an afraid Yuan Shang sent Yin Kui (Èô∞Â§î) and Chen Lin to negotiate for surrender. Cao Cao refused, and pressed Quzhang harder. One night, Yuan Shang abandoned Quzhang for Lankou (Êø´Âè£) in the western Qi Hills (Á•ÅÂ±±), where Cao Cao followed and defeated Yuan Shang once more. Yuan Shang's army was completely scattered, his generals Ma Yan (È¶¨Âª∂) and Zhang Yi (ÂºµÈ°ó) surrendered, and Yuan Shang himself fled far north to Zhongshan Commandery (‰∏≠Â±±). Cao Cao's men captured his baggages, seals, and other insignia. =End of the siege= Cao Cao had the trophies of his victory against Yuan Shang shown to the defenders of Ye, which greatly lowered their morale, but Shen Pei was adamant. He rallied the troops based on the hope that Yuan Shang's second brother Yuan Xi would soon come to the rescue from You Province, thus they have no reason to worry about Yuan Shang's rout. When Cao Cao rode out to inspect the siege- works, Shen Pei had crossbowmen fire at him; the shots missed narrowly. A few nights later, on September 13 of the Julian calendar, Shen Pei's nephew Shen Rong (ÂØ©Ê¶Æ) betrayed the city and opened the east gate at night to let in the enemy.de Crespigny (1996), p. 327 As Cao Cao's men breached the city, Shen Pei executed the families of Xin Pi's brother Xin Ping, whom he considered traitorous and responsible for the downfall of the Yuan clan, then personally joined the defense at the gates. Shen Pei and the remaining defenders were pushed into the city proper, where fighting continued in the streets for a while. Two sources, the \\"Parallel Annals of the Duke of Shanyang\\" (Â±±ÈôΩÂÖ¨ËºâË®ò) and the \\"Chronicle of Emperor Xian\\" (ÁçªÂ∏ùÊò•Áßã), claim that Shen Pei hid in a well when all seemed lost, but the compiler Pei Songzhi rejects this account.Biography of Yuan Shao, Volume 6, Annotated Records of the Three Kingdoms Whatever the circumstance, Shen Pei was captured alive, and the siege finally ended after dragging on for more than half a year. Aftermath Shen Pei remained defiant until the very end. He rebuked those who surrendered to Cao Cao and cursed the fact that the crossbow bolts did not hit Cao Cao. Cao Cao became impressed by his fierce loyalty and wanted to spare him, but Xin Pi and the others begged for his execution, so Shen Pei was to be beheaded. On the execution grounds, Shen Pei demanded to be allowed to face north as he died, since his lord Yuan Shang was in that direction. Cao Cao paid his respects at the tomb of Yuan Shao, where he wept for his friend-turned-enemy. He also offered condolences and pensions for members of Yuan Shao's family at Ye, though Cao Cao's son Cao Pi took Yuan Xi's wife Lady Zhen as his own wife in a serious breach of propriety. Politically, Cao Cao employed many of Yuan Shao's former officials, relieved all newly conquered territories of taxes for one year, and devoted his policies to rebuild the country devastated by the three-way war among Cao Cao and the Yuan brothers. All these gained him wide popularity, which, along with the contingents of Bing Province troops sent to settle at Ye, prevented the outbreak of rebellion in favour of the former rulers. Gao Gan, the Inspector of Bing Province, offered his nominal surrender to Cao Cao for the time being. For Cao Cao's successes, an imperial decree named him the Governor of Ji Province, but Cao Cao excused himself from the honour and continued with his old post as Governor of Yan Province.de Crespigny (2010), pp. 218-219 For the most part, the fall of Ye removed the Yuan clan's power from Ji province. Yuan Tan, who had been taking advantage of the siege of Ye to take territories that belonged to Yuan Shang, defeated Yuan Shang in Zhongshan and drove him further north to seek refuge under Yuan Xi in You Province. Since Yuan Tan was at least expected to help during the siege, Cao Cao now accused Yuan Tan of acting in bad faith, and cancelled the marriage between their families. Months later, Yuan Tan returned to Nanpi and Cao Cao moved to attack him, killing him in battle in the first month of 205.de Crespigny (2010), pp. 219-220 Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi were unable to reorganize their men in You Province after their setbacks and rebellions under their rule, and were decisively defeated along with their allies the Wuhuan in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. Ye proved to be a useful acquisition for Cao Cao, who took the city as his chief residence soon after its capture. Over the years the city and its surrounding Wei Commandery became the heart of Cao Cao's power, as he initiated several works in and around the city, including the much-celebrated Bronze Bird Terrace (ÈäÖÈõÄËá∫) and the Xuanwu Pond (ÁéÑÊ≠¶Ê±†), where he trained his navy. In 213 Cao Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei, named after Ye's commandery, and the name stuck throughout the rise of the Cao family's fortunes, culminating in the state of Cao Wei that succeeded the Han dynasty in 220. According to Shui Jing Zhu, Ye was regarded as the Northern Capital during the Wei dynasty.de Crespigny (2010), pp. 332-334, main text and note 2.

(capital city of Hungary) has existed since 1873, when the three main cities next the Danube river (Buda, Pest and √ìbuda) were united in one after existing during a millennium separately. The city committee that was planning the city's unification asked the master-painter Lajos Friedrich that design the coat of arms based in the cities' previous symbols and coats. Description of the coat of arms The coat of arms is composed by two blasons: the superior contains a castle with one tower that represents Pest, as well the inferior a three-towered castle that actually symbolizes Buda (where the Royal Palace of Buda is located). The undulated white stripe in the middle of both blasons represents the Danube river which separates Buda and Pest (passing through the middle of the city). On the top of the coat of arms lies the Crown of the King Saint Stephen, and a two legs standing lion grabs with its protector claws the city symbol on the left side, as a mythological griffin stands on the right side. History After Hungary was invaded by the Soviet armies, soon the coat of arms lost the Holy Crown on it, and was used from 1946 to 1949 without it. Between 1964 and 1990, a new coat of arms was used, avoiding to use the traditional Hungarian symbols that did not match with the communist ideals. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Hungary recovered its independence and in 1990 the original coat of arms created in 1873 was again reestablished.

Each method involves the therapist pretending to insert a \\"code\\" into patients' brains that will ostensibly provoke a strong adverse reaction should it come into contact with the addictive substance. The methods use a combination of theatrics, hypnosis, placebos, and drugs with temporary adverse effects to instill the erroneous beliefs. Therapists may pretend to \\"code\\" patients for a fixed length of time, such as five years.  Methods  In the case of alcohol addiction, the procedure may be carried out with a drug that temporarily affects the respiratory system when mixed with alcohol, administered under hypnosis. The therapist gives patients the drug, then allows them a small amount of alcohol, which triggers an adverse reaction and makes them erroneously believe that the therapy has had a long-term effect. Another method involves the therapist giving patients hypnotic suggestions during a head massage, with the message that alcohol will cause blindness or paralysis. In one method, the therapist numbs patients' mouths with local anaesthetic, then places electrodes with a very weak current into their mouths. This is to make patients believe that the \\"nerve points\\" in their mouth are being \\"manipulated\\" and that it is no longer safe for them to drink alcohol. A further method involves the therapist using a special helmet to persuade patients that the therapist's suggestions are controlling their minds. Typically, therapists will also make patients sign a disclaimer, supposedly absolving the therapist of any responsibility should the patient use the addictive substance and suffer ill effects or die.

Eighteen men and boys between the ages of 13 and 34 were killed in the explosion. Another died later. According to contemporary reports, the mine had been spotted by a number of people, including local youths, some of whom then waded out and tied ropes around it in an attempt to haul it ashore. They were then joined by other men and boys from the local area but as it was being hauled along the beach it is believed to have struck a rock and exploded, killing 18 people instantly. Another died the following day. More than 40 houses in the nearby village were damaged by the blast. Ireland was officially neutral during World War II, and there would have not been the same level of awareness amongst the public of the dangers of unexploded ordnance as in countries involved in the conflict. Other commentators noted that 15 other mines were made safe in Donegal in the same year, that local senior Garda S√≠och√°na members were aware of the mine at least 3 hours before the explosion and expected to secure a cordon around any reported mines.

It is endemic to Florida, where there are 72 known populations, only a few of which are large enough to be considered viable.USFWS. Nolina brittoniana. May 2010. It is federally listed as an endangered species of the United States. This plant has no aboveground stem. It is a rosette of leaves attached at a bulblike base which arises from an underground caudex, a modified stem. The grasslike leaves are up to a meter long and rarely more than a centimeter wide. The edges are serrated with cartilaginous teeth. The inflorescence is a large, erect panicle up to a meter tall. It has small bracts and reduced leaves. The many small flowers have tepals measuring only 1 or 2 millimeters long. While the flowers are bisexual, they are functionally unisexual, with either the male or female part reduced and not functional. Most plants have either functionally male or female flowers, but some have both. Blooming occurs in March through May.Nolina brittoniana. Center for Plant Conservation. The flowers give rise to winged capsules roughly a centimeter long by a centimeter wide.Nolina brittoniana. Flora of North America. The plant reproduces sexually via seed and vegetatively by cloning. Flowers of the plant. The plant is limited to seven counties in Central Florida, where it grows in a number of habitat types. It is known from various kinds of Florida scrub habitat, hammocks, and sandhills.Dolan, R. W., et al. (2004). Population genetic structure in Nolina brittoniana (Agavaceae), a plant endemic to the central ridges of Florida. Southeastern Naturalist 3:1 25-26. The habitat types are different in many ways but they all have dry, well-drained, low-nutrient sandy soils and they are all maintained by wildfire. The plant is present on Lake Wales Ridge, home to many rare Central Florida endemic plants. It grows alongside Polygala lewtonii, Polygonum dentoceras, Polygonum basiramia, Paronychia chartacea subsp. chartacea, Persea humilis, Liatris ohlingerae, Hypericum cumulicola, Conradina brevifolia, Calamintha ashei, and Bonamia grandiflora. The plant is relatively widespread when compared with other rare local plants, but most of the populations are small and some are made up of only female individuals. The beargrass is a member of plant communities that are maintained by a natural fire regime. Periodic wildfire halts the encroachment of large and woody vegetation, preventing ecological succession and keeping the canopy thin to allow sunlight to the herb layer below. These fire-maintained habitat types in Florida are largely degraded now because of a long-standing policy of fire suppression. They are overgrown, with thick canopies and a large amount of flammable organic buildup. Without fire, the beargrass does not grow well, its reproduction is inefficient, and its populations experience low recruitment. The beargrass flowers most profusely in the year following a fire. Many populations are located on privately owned land, and it is up to the landowner to decide whether or not to initiate controlled burns. Habitat is also being lost to development and to agricultural operations, particularly citrus groves. Habitat fragmentation has occurred. However, the species likely always been sparse in widespread populations, even before human interference in the habitat, and conservation of remaining habitat fragments will probably be enough to maintain it. Prescribed burns should be part of this conservation plan. While it is rare in the wild, the beargrass is cultivated in plant nurseries.

Several variations have been introduced through the centuries but the actual coat of arms doesn't stand away from the original one, except for the small variations in the architectural representations of the buildings on it. The city of Esztergom was the first capital of Hungary, the place where the king Saint Stephen I of Hungary was born and as the tradition says he was also crowned there. During centuries the city was the see of the Archbishop of Esztergom, the highest and most powerful Christian personality on the Hungarian Kingdom, having the right of coronation, the biggest incoming in taxes after the figure of the monarch, and also intervening in the political life through many conflicts during the Medieval, Modern and Contemporary times. Description of the coat of arms In the actual coat of arms of the city of Esztergom can be seen the gate of Saint Lorence, behind it can be seen the Palace of Szennye.

Yamato was the largest battleship in the world, and Japan sacrificed her in a final, desperate attempt to halt the Allied advance on the Japanese archipelago. The book was published in 1981 in the United States by Newmarket Press, and in the United Kingdom by Sidgwick & Jackson. Spurr, a British journalist and editor of the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review, interviewed Japanese and Americans involved with Yamatos last mission, and drew on Japanese naval documents and records to write the book. He tells the story from both the Japanese and American points of view. A Glorious Way to Die was generally well received by critics and historians. American author and journalist Charles Kaiser wrote in The New York Times that the book's strength is \\"its ability to re-create the fear the Japanese engendered with their desperation tactics\\", which resulted in American perception that they were all prepared to fight to the death. A reviewer in the Canadian journal Pacific Affairs commended Spurr's \\"well- balanced treatment of historical evidence and his workmanship in reconstructing the tragic event\\", and said that the book \\"deserves wide reading\\". Background During World War II Russell Spurr was a lieutenant in the Royal Indian Navy fighting the Japanese in Burma. After the war, in February 1946, Spurr was part of the Commonwealth occupation force stationed in the Japanese naval base of Kure in southern Japan. There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying what it had been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated in Burma for several years and had never heard of Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship. After returning to England, Spurr worked as a journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit of information on the fate of Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as a writer for the Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship. In his introduction to the book, Spurr said that he made no attempt to \\"gloss over the facts, unpalatable though they may be to either side.\\" He added, \\"The result, I trust, presents more than the story of a ship or a sortie, but offers some insight into the agonizing dilemma of a misguided, courageous people who persisted in continuing a hopeless war.\\" Synopsis In A Glorious Way to Die, Russell Spurr recounts the final mission of . He describes the events that led to the decision by the Japanese at Combined Fleet headquarters to send Yamato, the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy, on a suicide mission against the American Pacific Fleet during the Battle of Okinawa near the end of World War II. Spurr tells the story of Yamatos last mission from both the Japanese and the American point of view, dramatised in a third-person narrative. Yamato near the end of her fitting-out in September 1941 Construction of Yamato began in secrecy at the Kure naval base in 1937. She was completed soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, but had already been rendered obsolete by the Japanese themselves after their successful carrier-based attacks at Pearl Harbor and elsewhere. Yamato, the largest battleship in the world, with nine 18.1-inch guns with a range of over 22 miles, became, in the words of a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reviewer, a \\"70,000-ton white elephant the Japanese did not quite know what to do with\\". In March 1945, after the Americans had invaded Okinawa and all but eliminated the Japanese Navy, a final kamikaze mission called Operation Ten-Go (Operation Heaven One) was conceived by Japanese commanders at Combined Fleet to repulse the Allied advance on the Japanese archipelago. The plan was to send Yamato with eight support destroyers and a cruiser to Okinawa. Yamato would only be given enough fuel to reach Okinawa, and would have no air cover as all available airplanes would be used for a series of kamikaze attacks on US aircraft carriers. At Okinawa Yamato and her support craft would beach themselves and assist the island defenders. Without air cover there was little chance of Yamato reaching her destination, but, according to American author and journalist Charles Kaiser, the Japanese high command were \\"perfectly prepared to sacrifice the remnants of [their] fleet to avoid the stigma of surrender\\". Track chart of Yamatos last sortie to Okinawa in April 1945 Not all Japanese naval officers agreed with Combined Fleet's decision to sacrifice Yamato, and while they had no choice but to comply, some committed one act of defiance by secretly supplying the battleship and the rest of her fleet with enough fuel to return home. Yamato set sail for Okinawa from the Kure naval base on March 29, 1945. On April 7, 1945, the Americans intercepted the Japanese fleet, 200 miles from Okinawa. Using 280 bombers and torpedo planes in three waves of attacks from nine aircraft carriers, they sank the battleship and five of her support ships within three hours. After Yamato went down, the Americans machine-gunned survivors in the water. Spurr explains the reason for their hatred of the Japanese: After the US planes left the area, the remaining Japanese support ships picked up what survivors they could from the water and returned to Kure. According to Spurr, of Yamatos total crew of 3332, only 269 survived. The Americans lost 12 men in their attack on the Japanese fleet. Reception Roger Jaynes, writing in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described A Glorious Way to Die as \\"a dramatic absorbing account of Yamatos last mission\\". His only complaint was that the book takes too long to \\"get into\\", and that the first 90 pages, most of which deal with background information, should have been heavily condensed. But once \\"Yamato finally leaves port\\", Jaynes said the book is \\"a chilling account of how more than 3,000 Japanese sailors obediently sailed to their deaths, knowing they had no air cover and that the American planes were waiting\\". magazines prior to sinking In a review of the book in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard called it a \\"compelling story\\". He said that Spurr tells this \\"naval saga\\", which had degenerated into a \\"racial conflict\\", from the point of view of the people involved, \\"people who had little time for moralizing or preachments, anything but getting on with the killing\\". American author and journalist Charles Kaiser, also writing in The New York Times, said that the book's strength is \\"its ability to re-create the fear the Japanese engendered with their desperation tactics\\" and the resulting American perception that they were all prepared to fight to the death. Kaiser added that younger readers may have a better understanding from this book of what led to US President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan, \\"even if they ... question the morality of that decision\\". A reviewer at the Internet Bookwatch said the book is not just \\"a dry historical record\\", but is \\"aptly presented\\", well researched and \\"a worthy addition to World War II history shelves\\". Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"A gripping recreation of the last ten days in the life of HIJMS Yamato\\". It said that Spurr gives the battleship, which \\"live[s] on as a legend in Japan\\", \\"appropriately big-picture treatment\\", and explains Japan's \\"predilection for self-immolation\\" and its kamikaze philosophy. Kearney Smith, recounting his brother's experiences on a US Landing Craft Support ship in the Battle of Okinawa in Aboard LCS 11 in World War II: A Memoir by Lawrence B. Smith, also said that Spurr's book \\"give[s] lots of insight into the matter of kamikaze attacks\\". In a review in the Canadian journal Pacific Affairs, Kyozo Sato noted that the book highlights the Imperial Navy's \\"fatal lack of foresight\\" in recognizing the role air support and aircraft carriers would play in naval warfare, and persisted with the construction of Yamato. It also investigates \\"the politics and mentality of the Japanese leadership and the morale and spirit of the fighting men and the nation\\". He said that Spurr's hope that his book will help explain why Japan refused to surrender, \\"is a modest aspiration for his well-balanced treatment of historical evidence and his workmanship in reconstructing the tragic event\\". Sato's opinion of the book was that it \\"deserves wide reading\\". In 1981, A Glorious Way to Die was selected by the Military Book Club, and was a Literary Guild alternate selection.

The work of the CMCs is overseen by the Community Mediation Unit (CMU), a department set up within the Ministry of Law to run CMCs‚Äô day to day operations as well as promote the use of mediation in Singapore. Overview Set up with a view to providing Singaporeans with an accessible platform to resolve community and social disputes in an amicable manner, Singapore‚Äôs first CMC was established in 1998, following recommendations in 1997 by an inter-agency Committee on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The CMCs Act became law in 1998, providing for the establishment of the CMCs. The CMU‚Äôs mission is to provide mediation services for social, community or family disputes that do not involve an arrestable (seizable) offence under any written law. There are currently two CMCs at accessible locations in Singapore: CMC (Central), located at The Treasury and CMC (State Courts), located within the State Courts‚Äô building. History In March 1996, Professor S Jayakumar, then Minister for Law, tasked an inter- agency Committee to explore how Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes, in particular, mediation, could be further promoted in Singapore. This led to the formation of a Committee on ADR in May 1996, chaired by then Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, and comprising representatives from the Ministry of Law, Ministry of Community Development, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Courts, Attorney General's Chambers, the Singapore Academy of Law, the National University of Singapore, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, the Law Society of Singapore and Members of Parliament. In July 1997, the Committee on ADR submitted a report to the Government, recommending that less expensive and non-adversarial methods of dispute resolution should be introduced in order to prevent Singaporean society from becoming too litigious. These should cater to a wide range of social and community conflicts. Noting that mediation reflects important aspects of traditions and cultures that are worthy of preservation, the Committee on ADR recommended that mediation, in particular, should be promoted to resolve social and community disputes. Pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee, the Ministry of Law set up the CMCs to help promote a more harmonious, civil and gracious society, where social conflicts are resolved amicably without resort to litigation in the Courts. About Community Mediation in Singapore Mediation sessions at the CMCs are facilitated by a panel of trained volunteer mediators, who guide parties through discussion of the issues and assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable solution. The CMCs‚Äô volunteer mediators come from a wide range of backgrounds, many of whom also actively serve as Justice of the Peace (JP), senior grassroots and community leaders. Types of Disputes CMC handles The CMCs cater to community disputes, as opposed to commercial, legal or contractual disputes. The wide range types of disputes handled by the CMCs include relational disputes, such as quarrels between neighbours (e.g. noise, laundry dripping, corridor obstruction disputes), family conflicts (e.g. maintenance of elderly or disabled family members, spouse, parent-child), arguments, squabbles, spats, tiffs, quarrels and disagreements between friends, lovers, colleagues, landlord-tenant, hawker or shop-owner squabbles (e.g. placement of products) and conflicts between strangers (e.g. verbal or insulting gestures, utterance of unacceptable words, display of unacceptable behaviour or conduct, interest-free monetary matter based on verbal agreement involving less than S$5000). Either parties can voluntarily approach the CMCs directly for assistance by visiting a CMC, calling their hotline at 1800-2255-529 or enquiry/registration through their website at https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/cmc/en.html. Disputes may also be referred to the CMC for voluntary mediation by the Police, HDB, Town Council, Members of Parliament, Legal Aid Bureau or other community-based agency. In accordance with the Community Mediation Centres Act, Cap 49A, for the purposes of mediation and the Community Mediation Centre‚Äôs procedures thereof and under Sec 152(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap.68), should the referral be made by SPF and you subsequently fail or refuse to attend the mediation session, the Magistrate may dismiss any future complaints on the matter if you do not provide any reasonable grounds for such failure or refusal. Under the CMCs Act, where deemed appropriate, Magistrates also have the power to refer Magistrate Complaints to the CMCs for mandatory mediation. A CMC is co-located within the State Courts‚Äô premises for that purpose. The Magistrate can also refer suitable cases for mediation at the CMC under Section 15 of the CMC Act. For such cases, mediation is compulsory. Partnerships The CMCs collaborate with many partner agencies to encourage the awareness and use of community mediation in Singapore. It has referral arrangements with frontline public and community agencies, such as the Housing and Development Board (HDB), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the People‚Äôs Association (PA). Through collaboration with its partners, the CMC aims to channel appropriate social and community disputes to CMC, as well as to increase awareness and use of community mediation. Youth Outreach As part of the CMCs‚Äô efforts to build a mediation culture in Singapore, it organises a variety of youth-oriented outreach programmes to generate awareness and understanding of mediation among youth. Currently, there are three main youth programmes organised by the CMC: the Peer Mediation Assembly programme, Youth Mediation Forum and Peer Mediation Training Workshops. The Peer Mediation Assembly Programme consists of an interactive performance with themes related to conflict resolution and mediation; and introduces the mediation process. The annual Youth Mediation Forum is a platform for student leaders to share their thoughts about how conflicts amongst youths should be resolved and learn more about mediation. The Peer Mediation Training Workshop uses a variety of methods to equip student leaders with peer mediation skills. Through videos, lectures and role- play scenarios, students experience the mediation process first-hand to facilitate application in their daily lives.

She was seized by the United Kingdom in 1914, passing to the Admiralty. In 1920, she was passed to the Secretary of State for India. She was sold to Greece in 1925 and renamed Hadiotis. In 1928, she was sold to Italy and renamed Felce. In 1940, she was seized by the United Kingdom and passed to the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). Renamed Empire Defender, she served until 14 November 1941, when she was torpedoed and sunk. Her sinking killed four crew members on board. Description The ship was built in 1910 by Joh. C.

History Freienfels was built for Deutsche Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft \\"Hansa\\" (DDG Hansa), Bremen. She was launched on 20 September 1910 and delivered on 22 November. Her port of registry was Bremen and the Code Letters QJVC were allocated. She had a crew of 63. On 5 August 1914, Freienfels was seized by the United Kingdom at Calcutta, India. She was requisitioned by the Admiralty and operated under the management of Grahams & Co Ltd. Her port of registry was changed to London and the Code Letters JLGB were allocated. Freienfels was allocated the Official Number 139043. In 1920, she was passed to the Secretary of State for India, operating under the management of the Director, India Office Shipping. Freienfels was one of five ships that were condemned to detention, but not declared to be prizes of war. The other ships were , , and . Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, they were to be sold. On 2 March 1925, questions were asked in Parliament by Joseph Kenworthy, MP about the profitability and proposed sale of the ships to Greece, and what arrangements had been made for the continued employment of her British crew. In reply, Earl Winterton, then Under-Secretary of State for India said that the five ships had made in excess of ¬£1,700,000 profit. The disposal of the ships was a matter for the Reparation Commission and the India Office had no say in the disposal of the ships. Frienfels was duly advertised for sale in June 1925. She would be available for inspection at Dunquerque, France from 6‚Äì18 June, and would then depart for Falmouth, Cornwall where she was to be laid up pending sale. She was described as , 9,112 DWT. Freienfels was sold to Pnevmaticos, Rethymnis & Yannaghas, Syra, Greece. She was renamed Hadiotis. In 1927, she was sold to Kassos Steam Navigation Co. Ltd, Syra and placed under the management of Pnevmaticos, Rethymnis & Yannaghas. In September 1928, Hadiotis was sold to Achille Lauro fu Giochine & Co, Naples, Italy and was renamed Felce. The Code Letters NPCL were allocated. On 1 January 1934, these were changed to IBVL. On 18 January 1937, Felce ran aground at Djibouti, French Somaliland. After her cargo was discharged, she was refloated with assistance from a tug. On 10 June 1940, Felce was in port at Haifa, Palestine. She was seized and passed to the MoWT. She was renamed Empire Defender. Her port of registry was changed to London and the Code Letters GPJG were allocated. She was placed under the management of the City Line Ltd. She was assessed as , and would have regained her previous Official Number 139043. Empire Defenders movements over the next six months are not recorded. She departed from Suez, Egypt on 4 November 1940 as a member of Convoy BS 8, which dispersed off Aden on 12 November. She detached from the convoy before it dispersed and sailed to Port Sudan, Sudan, arriving on 8 November. She departed from Port Sudan on 22 November to join Convoy BS 9, which had departed from Suez on 18 November and dispersed on 26 November at . She sailed to Mombasa, Kenya, arriving on 8 December. Leaving Mombasa on 15 December, she sailed to Durban, South Africa, where she arrived on 26 December. During 1941, management of Empire Defender passed to the Stanhope Steamship Co Ltd. Empire Defender departed from Durban on 6 April 1941 for Cape Town, where she arrived on 11 April. Although she departed from Cape Town on 17 April, she returned two days later. She departed for a second time on 3 May for Freetown, Sierra Leone, arriving there on 22 May. Empire Defender departed from Freetown on 15 June for Saint Lucia, where she arrived on 5 July, departing five days later for the Hampton Roads, Virginia, United States, arriving on 21 July. She departed from the Hampton Roads on 10 August for Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, arriving four days later. She departed from Halifax on 16 August as a member of Convoy HX 156, which arrived at Liverpool, Lancashire, United Kingdom on 31 August. Empire Defender was carrying general cargo. She left the convoy at Loch Ewe on 30 August to join Convoy WN 175, which departed the next day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 3 September. She then joined Convoy FS 585, which arrived at Southend-on-Sea on 6 September. Empire Defender departed from Southend on 27 September as a member of Convoy FN 524, which arrived at Methil on 29 September. The next day, she departed from Methil to join Convoy EC 79, which had departed from Southend on 28 September and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 3 October. She sailed on to the Clyde, arriving on 3 October. Empire Defender was ordered to sail from Glasgow to Malta laden with ammunition, as part of Operation Astrologer. On 20 October 1941, 60 lascar sailors refused to sail, claiming that the vessel was cursed and would be sunk before the next new moon. The authorities were unable to persuade them to sail by either threats or inducements. An equivalent number of white sailors were procured with a payment of ¬£10 in cash each to accept the lascar accommodation. The ship had been repainted with a black hull, white topsides and a buff funnel, contrary to wartime regulations. All armament had been removed in an effort to make the ship appear as though it belonged to a neutral country. She departed from the Clyde on 29 October to join Convoy OG 76, which departed from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire on 26 October and arrived at Gibraltar on 11 November. Empire Defender passed Gibraltar on 11 November, and headed for Malta. The flag of whichever nation's waters she was in at the time was painted on her hull, thus she was passed off as a French, Spanish and Italian ship. Operation Astrologer had probably been compromised following the loss of the merchantman on 2 May 1941 and the subsequent interrogation of her crew who were interned in France. The progress of Empire Defender had probably been monitored from the Spanish coast. On 14 November 1941, she was attacked either by a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 or a Savoia-Marchetti S.84 aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica, which dropped an aerial torpedo. Empire Defender was set on fire and her crew abandoned her. They had only just done this when she blew up and sank south of the Galite Islands, Tunisia. Four of her crew were killed. The survivors became Prisoners of War. Those lost on Empire Defender are commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial, London.

In the Assamese language, it is called Bihu. The Bodos call this popular festival \\"Baisagu\\", which means the start of the new year. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \\"Baisa\\" that means \\"year\\" or \\"age\\" and \\"Agu\\" that means \\"starting\\" or \\"start\\" [1]. This Baisagu festival is observed at the beginning of the first month of the Assamese year, around mid- April. Characteristics The characteristics of the Bwisagu festivals can be classified as follows: * \\"Gwkha-Gwkhwi Janai\\" or eating bitter & sour-tasting wild vegetables on the day of Sankranti, or the day before the first day of the new year. * \\"Mwsou thukhwinai\\" or bathing of cattle * Worshipping gods and goddesses * Worshipping ancestors * Merry-making and enjoyment at the beginning of the new year. Bwisagu, as observed by Kacharis, indicates the pattern which the festival follows over several days. The first day is for the \\"Makhau\\" or \\"Mashau\\" meant for cattle, on which the cows are bathed in the river. The second day is meant for the \\"Mansi\\" or Men but starts with worshiping their gods; the third day is for \\"Saima\\" meant for dogs; the fourth day is for \\"Oma\\" meant for swine; the fifth day is for \\"Dao\\", or meant for fowl; the sixth for duck and other birds; the seventh is meant for receiving relatives and friends. House cleaning, battle rites, worship of Bathow and offering food to their ancestors, of new and washed clothes, receiving and visiting relatives, friends, etc. may be said to constitute the formal part of the festival. Worshiping of Bathow is done on the second day of the festival. There is also the - eating cooked fowl with a bitter herb known as \\"Khungkha\\" or other wild vegetables with varied flavors. They also offer this to visitors. Merrymaking is an integral part of this Bodo Festival. Music and dance become a regular feature. Young men play on the \\"Sifung\\" (flute), \\"Kham\\" (drum), the four-stringed \\"Serj√£\\", and beat out a rhythm with a piece of split bamboo called \\"Th√£rkh√£\\". Girls dance in bands and play on the Jew's harp called \\"Gongon√£\\" and small cymbals called \\"jotha\\". Rites performed during Bwis√£gu The Bodos perform certain rites on the occasion me the Bwis√£gu festival: * They produce a particular tune on the flute, the tune is called \\"Santravali\\". It is believed to destroy snake eggs. Because Bodos believe snakes are a foe of all creatures, annihilation of snakes is considered an act of general welfare. * Worship the deities. * Worship to their ancestors. * Bid farewell to the old year. * Pay respect to the teachers and elderly persons. * Exchange love and affection. * Dance and sing songs. * Worship their god (Bur√£h B√£thou Mah√£r√£j√£) with the hope of more and more production and growth my cultivation. * On the seventh-day bid farewell to \\"Bwisagu\\". Cattle Rites during Bwis√£gu The last date of the month of Chaitra is called by the Bodos as the Bwis√¢gu for the cows or cattle. On the same day, the Bodos lead the cattle to the tank or the river for bathing. Before taking to the river or tank the cattle are offered paddy and horns and hooves are smeared with mustard oil. The body of the cow is routed with black marking with a mixture prepared from black ashes and mustard oil, using the stem of the Eri tree as the marker. The cows are also garlanded with garlands made of gourd and brinjals. Before taking them off the cowshed the owner pays respects to them. While leading the cows to the river for bathing the cowherds sing songs and beat them lightly with the \\"Dighalati\\" plant. After taking away the cows from the cowshed, the cow dunk cakes are thrown away and the shed is cleaned. The old ropes (phaga) are replaced by new ones.

Leader of the organisation's A Company, Highfield, West Belfast Brigade, McQuiston spent more than 12 years in HM Prison Maze outside Lisburn for possession of weapons. He is now a community activist, often working with former members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in West Belfast's troubled interface areas where adjoining loyalist and republican communities occasionally clash. Ulster Defence Association McQuiston was born and raised in west Belfast's staunchly loyalist and Protestant Shankill Road area. Billy McQuiston joined the junior wing of the UDA immediately after the 1971 Balmoral Furniture Company bombing, with his decision also influenced by his father having been UDA commander in the area at the time. He recalls: \\"The area I came from, the family that I came from and the activity that was going on in that area, I don‚Äôt think I really had any other choice.\\" He was almost 15 at the time the bomb exploded on a Saturday afternoon in the heart of the Shankill, which was crowded with shoppers. The bomb killed two adult men and two babies. McQuiston was with a friend and they were on their way to the city centre; the boys rushed to the scene and saw the bodies of the infants as they were brought out of the rubble, wrapped in sheets. The following evening he and several friends attended a meeting of the local UDA. One at a time, the teenaged boys were brought into a room by two men wearing hoods. McQuiston faced three men seated at a table on which rested a Bible, gun and an Ulster Banner. After being asked his motive for wishing to join the UDA, he repeated an oath with one hand upon the Bible and the other the gun, and was duly sworn in as a member of the \\"Ulster Young Militants\\" (UYM), the junior wing of the UDA.Taylor, Peter (1999).Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. pp.90‚Äì91 He became the leader of the UDA's A Company, Highfield, West Belfast Brigade. Described by journalist David Lister as \\"stocky, and impish-faced\\", the five feet four McQuiston had a reputation among the UDA as a \\"messer\\", which is Belfast slang for a practical joker.\\"The 'odd couple' bridge Ulster's divide\\". Sunday Times. David Lister. 10 July 2004 He was first sent to prison on the evidence of a supergrass.Taylor. p.207 He spent 31 days on hunger strike in 1982. He was released in the mid-1980s and it was during this period that he became acquainted with the British agent Brian Nelson, who had infiltrated the UDA. McQuiston was soon sent back to the Maze Prison after being caught in Portadown with masks, hoods, and weapons.Taylor. pp.207‚Äì208 Upon his release in 1991, he survived an assassination attempt by the IRA who had broken down his door with a sledgehammer and tried to shoot him with an AK-47. He evaded his attackers by escaping through his loft. In an interview with journalist Peter Taylor in the 1990s, he stated that he had not been overly perturbed by the attempt on his life. He offered the following explanation for his nonchalance > It's a war. I'm a soldier in the UDA so I'm entitled to be shot at now and > again. I think I was extremely lucky.Taylor. p.208 On 23 October 1993, he was on the Shankill Road conducting business for the Loyalist Prisoners' Association (LPA). He had just gone into a pub when an IRA bomb went off in a fish shop below the LPA headquarters where it was believed senior UDA members, including Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) brigadier Johnny Adair, were having a meeting. The IRA's Intelligence was faulty and the meeting had been cancelled; instead of wiping out Adair and his comrades, 10 people were killed in the shop below, including two children, the shop's owner, and his daughter, low-rank UDA member Michael Morrison, and Thomas Begley, one of the bombers. McQuiston helped pull the dead and wounded from the devastated building.Taylor, p.224 Role in Adair feud McQuiston remained a popular and influential figure in Highfield, a loyalist estate located on the Upper Shankill and near the republican Ballymurphy area. In 2003, the UDA's South Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald contacted McQuiston shortly after the murder of South-East Antrim brigadier John \\"Grugg\\" Gregg to secure Twister's aid in avoiding too much bloodshed in an operation to remove Johnny Adair, who was held responsible for Gregg's killing. McQuiston helped to ensure that A and B companies of the West Belfast brigade, covering the Highfield and Woodvale areas, agreed not to oppose McDonald's operations in the lower Shankill whilst McQuiston was also put in charge of a scheme at the Shankill's Heather Street Social Club where members of the lower Shankill C Company could attend to break from Adair and return to the mainstream UDA. Mo Courtney was amongst the leading figures to take this opportunity.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, pp. 383‚Äì384 Subsequent activities Since leaving the UDA, McQuiston has worked as a community activist for the Springfield Intercommunity Development Project. He works alongside former IRA members in troubled interface areas near the west Belfast Peace Line where loyalists and republicans sometimes clash, especially during the annual 12 July Orange Order parades which commemorate the Battle of the Boyne. This was particularly noted in the summer of 2003 when a relatively calm marching season followed at the interfaces of north and west Belfast as a result of co-operation between McQuiston and his Provisional IRA counterpart Sean \\"Spike\\" Murray.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 396 He is also a member of the UDA's political advisory group, the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG).

He is said to have graduated at the University of Glasgow, but his name is not found in the college register. He was licensed by Ballymena presbytery (before 29 June 1762), and called 13 February 1763 to the congregation of Ballycarry (or Broadisland), County Antrim. This, the oldest presbyterian church in Ireland, was founded by Edward Brice in 1613, and had been vacant since the death of James Cobham (22 February 1759). Bankhead subscribed (26 July 1763) to the confession of faith in the following cautious form: 'I believe the Westminster Confession to contain a system of the Christian doctrines, which doctrines I subscribe as the confession of my faith;' and was ordained by Templepatrick presbytery, 16 August 1763. A unanimous call was given him in July 1774 by the richer congregation of Comber, County Down ; but he remained at Ballycarry all his days, and made a considerable fortune out of a grazing farm. 1786-1881 In 1786 he published a catechism, valuable as indicating the departure from the old standards of doctrine, already hinted at in the terms of his subscription. The questions are precisely those of the Westminster Shorter Catechism; the answers are naked extracts from Scripture, without comment. In the second edition, 1825, a further progress is made; some of the Westminster questions are omitted, others are altered. Bankhead was moderator of synod in 1800. On 30 July 1812 William Glendy (died 24 July 1853, aged 71) was ordained as his assistant and successor. In 1829 Glendy took the congregation with him to join the heterodox remonstrant synod; but Bankhead remained on the roll of the general synod till his death, which occurred on 5 July 1833, he being then in the ninety-sixth year of his age, and the seventieth of his ministry (the inscription on his tombstone overestimates on both points). It is remarkable that the whole period of 220 years (1613‚Äì1833) in the history of Ballycarry congregation is spanned by the pastorates of four men, the interstices between their ministries amounting collectively to seventeen years. Bankhead was a man of much natural ability. A satirical poem of 1817 ('The Ulster Synod,‚Äô by Rev. William Heron, of Ballyclare) describes him, in his eightieth year, as 'scattering bright wit, sound sense, and Dublin snuff.' Family He was twice married, (1) to Jane Martin, (2) in February 1812 to Mary Magill, and was the father of twenty-two children, nineteen of whom reached maturity, and some found distinction. His eldest son was John Bankhead, M.D., a leading physician of Belfast. Another was James Bankhead, ordained 23 March 1796, presbyterian minister of Bromore, County Down (d. 10 Jan. 1824). Another son, Charles Bankhead, M.D., was private physician to the celebrated Lord Londonderry, who expired in his arms in 1822; he died at Florence, aged 91, and was father of Charles Bankhead, British envoy to Washington. The latest survivor of the twenty-two children was William Bankhead, unitarian minister at Brighton and Diss, Norfolk (1837‚Äì43), who left the ministry, and died in Edinburgh, 1881, aged 69.

He was interested in eugenics and proposed a link between Marxism and mental retardation. It is suspected that 30,000 children were taken from socialist families and placed with fascist families. Vallejo-N√°jera was rewarded for his assistance during the Spanish Civil War and he became a leading figure in Spanish psychiatry.  Early life  Vallejo-N√°jera was born in Paredes de Nava in 1889. He studied medicine at the University of Valladolid and joined the army‚Äôs sanitary corps in 1910, taking part in the Rif War between 1912 and 1915. During World War I he was posted to the military department at the Spanish Embassy in Berlin. There he met well-known figures of German Psychiatry such as Gruhle, Schwalb and Kraepelin. He also conducted inspections of prisoner of war concentration camps, an activity for which he was awarded medals by Belgium and France after the war. On returning to Spain he worked at the Ciempozuelos Military Psychiatric Clinic. When the Civil War broke out he was a teacher of Psychiatry in the Military Sanitary Academy. Vallejo N√°jera promoted in Spain a personal notion of eugenics, intending to reconcile German doctrines of racial hygiene from authors like Schwalb with the requirements of Catholic moral doctrine, opposed to state-imposed measures of eugenic restriction. He advocated eugamia, a eugenic policy implemented through premarital orientation work based on the biopsychological assessment of a couple‚Äôs personality.  Spanish Civil War and Francoist repression During the Spanish Civil War he supported the nationalists. In 1938, he set up the Gabinete de Investigaciones Psicol√≥gicas de la Inspecci√≥n de Campos de Concentraci√≥n de Prisioneros de Guerra (Psychological Research Bureau of Inspection of Prisoner of War Concentration Camps), a center for psychological investigations. The bureau was established near the San Pedro de Carde√±a concentration camp and had fourteen clinics in the nationalist zone. Vallejo Najera carried out experiments on female Spanish Republican Army and International Brigades prisoners to establish \\"the bio-psychic roots of Marxism\\" and find the \\"red gene\\".Preston, Paul. The Spanish civil war. Reaction, revolution & revenge. Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.310 For Vallejo Najera, Marxists were genetic retardsTremlett, Giles. Ghosts of Spain. Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63 and Marxism was a mental illness: \\"A priori, it seems probable that psychopaths of all types would join the Marxist ranks... Since Marxism goes together with social immorality... we presume those fanatics who fought with arms will show schizoid temperaments\\". Vallejo‚Äôs conclusions were that the only way to prevent the racial dissolution of the Spanish was to take away the red children from their mothers in places \\"away from democratic environments and where the exaltation of bio-psychic racial qualities is encouraged\\".Tremlett, Giles. Ghosts of Spain. Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63 By 1943, 12,043 children had been taken from their mothers and handed over to orphanages or Francoist families,Beevor, Antony.

Ghosts of Spain. Faber and Faber.

Vallejo Najera contributed to the justification of the Francoist post-war repression. He said that the reds should: \\"suffer the punishment they deserve, with death the easiest of them all. Some will live in permanent exile... Others will lose their freedom, groaning for years in prisons, purging their crimes with forced work in order to earn their daily bread...\\".Tremlett, Giles. Ghosts of Spain. Faber and Faber. London. 2006. pp.61-62 According to Paul Preston the \\"investigations\\" of Vallejo-Najera provided the Francoist State with \\"scientific\\" arguments in order to \\"justify their views on the subhuman nature of their adversaries\\".Preston, Paul. The Spanish civil war. Reaction, revolution & revenge. Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.310 According to the Spanish psychiatrist Carlos Castillo del Pino: \\"For Vallejo Nagera, reds were degenerates and if they were allowed to breed they would enfeeble the Spanish race. Therefore, they had to be exterminated.\\"http://vimeo.com/26232645  Later life When the Civil War ended, Vallejo's support for Francoism was rewarded by his appointment as Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Madrid. \\"He became one of the most influential figures in Spanish Psychiatry and Psychology in the forties and fifties: his name is among the 16 founders of the Spanish Psychological Society.\\"http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm He died in 1960.http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm See also *White Terror (Spain) References *Beevor, Antony.

It is a colorless water-soluble solid.  Production  1,6-Hexanediol is prepared by the hydrogenation of adipic acid or its esters. Laboratory preparation could be achieved by reduction of adipates with lithium aluminium hydride, although this method is impractical on a commercial scale. Properties As 1,6-hexanediol contains the hydroxyl group, it undergoes the typical chemical reactions of alcohols such as dehydration, substitution, esterification. Dehydration of 1,6-hexanediol gives oxepane, 2-methyltetrahydropyran and 2-ethyltetrahydrofuran. Corresponding thiophene and pyrrolidone can be made by reacting 1,6-hexanediol with hydrogen sulfide and ammonia respectively.BASF intermediates, BASF  Uses  1,6-Hexanediol is widely used for industrial polyester and polyurethane production.. 1,6-Hexanediol can improve the hardness and flexibility of polyesters as it contains a fairly long hydrocarbon chain. In polyurethanes, it is used as a chain extender, and the resulting modified polyurethane has high resistance to hydrolysis as well as mechanical strength, but with a low glass transition temperature. It is also an intermediate to acrylics as a crosslinking agent, e.g. hexanediol diacrylate. Unsaturated polyester resins have also been made from 1,6-hexanediol, along with styrene, maleic anhydride and fumaric acid. Safety 1,6-Hexanediol has low toxicity and low flammability, and is generally considered as safe. It is not irritating to skin, but may irritate the respiratory tract or mucous membranes. Dust or vapor of the compound can irritate or damage the eyes.

History  Radio Pilipinas started in 2005. It was first called Fatal Radio. The Internet radio was a partnership of young American DJs in United States and Filipino DJs in the Philippines. The 24-hour streaming time was divided into 12 hours for the USA and 12 hours for the Philippines. Each would broadcast during daytime of their respective time zone. The main organizers of fatalradio were Jamez Strickland, Jake Williams, Michael Walker, Nolit Abanilla and Alexis Moreno. The American side played mostly Hip hop and Alternative music. Among its regular DJs include the brother of Evanescence drummer who also has his own band. The Philippine side on the other hand played mostly Pinoy rock of the 90s as well as new wave stuff. Kuyakurt was the main DJ for the Filipino stream. The Filipino partners took charge of designing and managing the site while the American partners did the technical as well as financed the radio. Towards the end of 2005, cultural differences and persistent tug of war on streaming time brought out a split in Fatal Radio. The American partners decided to set up a new radio of their own. The Filipino staff went on streaming with Fatal Radio until financial issues forced the server to shut down. In 2006, Fatal Radio continued to stream from an unstable free shoutcast server. However this was limited to a few listeners thus marketing the radio was futile. In 2007, Kuyakurt and Nolit decided to revamp the Internet radio and decided to name it Radio Pilipinas. Jeffrey McAdder financed the acquisition of the domain and nolithosting provided the site. Getting a new dedicated shoutcast server was hard as financial issues continue to plaque the staff. So the staff decided to run its site with a simple player of serverside mp3 files and let the listeners choose from a playlist whatever they want to play. The staff still continued on using the free shoutcast server with limited listener capacity from time to time. Towards the end of 2008, nolithosting has acquired the ownership of Radio Pilipinas domain and got a shoutcast server installed in one of its collocated computers on a datacenter in Dallas, USA. The new development paved the way for Kuyakurt and Nolit to redevelop Radio Pilipinas as a full Internet radio running on shoutcast server. Radio Pilipinas is currently running on one source server with two backup servers all running on state of the art centovacast software. A total of 4 relay servers are also running - three are on 64kbit/s with hundreds of listener capacity. One server is on 32kbit/s which is intended for listeners with dial up connections. This server runs on a random playlist not synch with the main server but of similar content.http://radiopilipinas.com/index.php?page=aboutus In 2009, Indiepinoy, a registered independent music label in the Philippines, acquired the ownership of radiopilipinas. It a;so moved it streaming server from USA to UK running both on icecast and shoutcast still running on low bitrate in order to accommodate internet users with slow connections.

He started teaching at the Ecole des Hautes √©tudes en Sciences Sociales and joined Sciences Po Paris in 1998, where he created a pioneering transdisciplinary course on Genocides and extreme violence. The thread running through Jacques Semelin‚Äôs work could be summarized as follows: how can ‚Äúordinary people‚Äù can commit extraordinary crimes (genocide) or resist without weapons against authoritarian or totalitarian regimes (civil resistance)? This is how he devoted his PhD to the comparative analysis of some thirty examples of civil resistance in Nazi Europe, summarized in his book Unarmed Against Hitler (1994), available now in five languages. Following this research, he then inquired about the development of civil resistance in Communist Europe (through media strategies) until the fall of the Berlin Wall. He published his results in a new book: Freedom over the Airwaves (1997, Published in English in 2016 by the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict ( )). In 2014, he received the James Lawson Award for his research, awarded at Tuft University by the International Center of Nonviolent Conflicts. Meanwhile, Jacques Semelin became increasingly engaged in holocaust genocide studies, especially since his visit to Auschwitz. He began to work on his master book on mass violence: Purify and Destroy (2007), available now in eight languages. For this book, he was awarded a prize by the Association Fran√ßaise de Science Politique and received the Figaro-Sciences Po Prize in 2007. In 2008, Jacques Semelin founded at Sciences Po massviolence.org, under the sponsorship of Simone Veil and Esther Mujawayo (Rwanda). This online encyclopedia is no longer working for lack of funds but the archives are still available online. In 2010, Jacques Semelin was appointed as consultant to the United Nations for the genocide prevention (Office of political affairs). Jacques Semelin has also initiated a new research program on rescue in genocidal situations. He is co-founder of the Chambon sur Lignon museum (Lieu de m√©moire) where Jewish children and adults were saved in France during the Nazi occupation. In 2006, he co-directed an international symposium on genocidal rescue practices at Sciences Po. The proceedings were published in 2010, under the title Resisting Genocide. Subsequently, Jacques Semelin engaged in a study to understand how 75% of Jews in France survived the Holocaust. The resulting book, Pers√©cutions et entraides dans la France occup√©e (2013), rich in many testimonies of non- deported Jews (French and foreigners) was awarded by Foundation of the Resistance (Prix Phillipe Viannay) and the \\"Emerald\\" Prize of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. Taking into account the many debates aroused by this book especially with Robert Paxton, Jacques Semelin has written an abridged version, updated and reworked, published in 2018 and prefaced by Serge Klarsfeld (reference), under the title The survival of the Jews in France, 1940-1944. This book has been published in English by Oxford University Press (USA) and Hurst (UK) and in German at Wallstein. In his autobiographical book J'arrive o√π je suis √©tranger (2007) (I arrive where I feel a stranger), Jacques Semelin speaks openly about his struggle against an inexorable blindness. In 2016, he also published Je veux croire au soleil, a humourous account of his stay in Montreal as a visually-impaired professor, based on anecdotes from everyday life.

The Atelier, which became a major political entity, accepted as its members women who were professional illustrators and writers but also encouraged non- professional artists to submit work, and paid them a small percentage of any profits. It held its first public meeting in London in February 1909, styling itself as an \\"Arts and Crafts Society working for the enfranchisement of women\\". It ran printmaking, banner-making, drawing and stenciling workshops and held competitions. The Suffrage Atelier's policy was to produce only what could be quickly reproduced and circulated and so made great use of block- printing, both in wood and as linocuts in response to events. Clemence Housman was a well-respected member of the WSPU, so much of the production of the Suffrage Atelier was distributed in the WSPU store chains and national newspaper.

(2010) Indian Ocean Region: Maritime Regimes for Regional Cooperation, London: Springer p 52 Buzan and W√¶ver are perhaps best known as the key figures behind the influential Copenhagen School of security studies, in which the main principle is examining security as a social construct (see also securitization). RSCT posits that international security should be examined from a regional perspective, and that relations between states (and other actors) exhibit regular, geographically clustered patterns. Regional security complex is the term coined by Buzan and W√¶ver to describe such structures.  Regional security complexes  Regional security complexes (RSC) are defined as distinct and stable patterns of security interaction between actors. They are distinguished from one another by degrees of interaction. The level of interaction between members of the same RSC is high, while between members of different RSCs it is comparatively low. As the name implies regional security complexes are by nature geographical, consisting of neighboring actors and being insulated from one another by natural barriers such as oceans, deserts and mountain ranges. Individual states can also function as such ‚Äúinsulators‚Äù between RSCs. RSCT posits that actors‚Äô actions and motivations in the field of international security are heavily regional in character. This means that an actor‚Äôs security concerns are primarily generated in their immediate neighborhood. The security of each actor in a region interacts with the security of the other actors. Most security concerns do not travel well over distances, and threats within an actor‚Äôs immediate neighborhood are therefore most likely felt the strongest. Due to the way adjacency works there is often intense security interdependence within an RSC, but interaction with outsiders is much less active. As Buzan and W√¶ver state: > ‚ÄúSimple physical adjacency tends to generate more security interaction among > neighbours than among states located in different areas, a point also > emphasised by Walt (1987: 276-7) Adjacency is potent for security because > many threats travel more easily over short distances than over long ones.‚Äù The theory is complicated by existence of actors with global security interests and force projection capabilities. However, Buzan and W√¶ver posit that even the global powers‚Äô security interests are fundamentally regional in nature. Their involvement in regional security issues should be most often seen as them being drawn in by regionally generated matters; not necessarily as great power issues penetrating an RSC, although that can happen as well. RSCs can be interpreted as systems in and of themselves, as ‚Äúmicro‚Äù systems embedded in a larger, global political system. RSCs contain their own security dynamics, which are in normal circumstances largely independent from global security dynamics. This enables the application of various IR concepts ‚Äì such as balance-of-power, polarity and interdependence ‚Äì on a regional scale. Further refining the theory are the concepts of regional subcomplexes (essentially RSCs within RSCs) and supercomplexes (essentially the adjoining of neighboring RSCs). Buzan & W√¶ver view security interests as primarily regional in nature. This is in opposition to a view ‚Äì predominant during the Cold War ‚Äì that sees security politics as largely a reflection of global great power interests. Buzan and W√¶ver point to the Middle East as an example, where the security landscape has seen no effective change despite the ending of the Cold War: > ‚ÄúSecurity features at the level of regions are durable. They are > substantially self-contained not in the sense of being totally free- > standing, but rather in possessing a security dynamic that would exist even > if other actors did not impinge on it. This relative autonomy was revealed > by the ending of the Cold War, when enmities such as that between Israel and > Syria, and Iraq and the Gulf Arab States, easily survived the demise of a > superpower rivalry that had supported, but not generated, them.‚Äù RSCs are conceptually distinct from ‚Äúregions‚Äù. Where as regions ‚Äì as used in culture, history or politics ‚Äì are discursively formed concepts with varying definitions depending on context, RSCs are strictly theoretical constructs, formed from theory via deductive reasoning. Therefore, culturally relevant definitions such as ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù or ‚ÄúMiddle-East‚Äù do not necessarily constitute RSCs; however there is overlap with theoretically defined RSCs and cultural definitions of regions. Buzan and W√¶ver‚Äôs view of security as a social construct means that things such as culture and history can have significant influence on actors‚Äô perceptions. RSCs are nevertheless solely based on distinct patterns of interaction.  Place in international relations theory literature  Buzan and W√¶ver describe their work as a sort of extension of the monolithic neorealist school of international relations, ‚Äúincorporating‚Äù it, while also filling in perceived theoretical gaps. They stress the importance of adopting a regional perspective (as opposed to the predominant global system one) and paying more attention to security actors other than states. The conception of security not as an objective fact, but as an intersubjectively constructed social phenomenon is the mainstay of the Copenhagen school of IR. RSCT hinges on this social definition of security. According to RSCT, regional security complexes cannot be identified or understood by merely examining material differences between actors (for example size of armed forces or nuclear arsenal), rather, attention needs to be paid how actors interpret such material facts. RSCT should not be confused with regionalism, a subset of IR from the 1970s concerned mostly with regional integration. In Regions and Powers, Buzan and W√¶ver view earlier attempts to conceptualise international regions as unsuccessful.

He has published several editions, including the Easy Bach Album and Easy Handel Album with B√§renreiter and the Complete Church Organist, volumes 1 and 2, with RSCM Publications. His articles on performance practice and performance-related topics have appeared in various music journals. =Broadcast and film work= Daniel Moult has performed for many broadcasts on BBC Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4 and BBC Television, including numerous broadcasts of Songs of Praise and Choral Evensong. Daniel Moult co-wrote and presented the documentary The Elusive English Organ, a film that traced the development of the English organ from 1550 to 1830, discovering why so few pre-1830 English organs survive and to what extent it is possible to perform repertoire written during this period on instruments from the composers‚Äô times. Locations included Lanvellec, Ploujean, Adlington Hall, St Botolph's Aldgate and St James, Bermondsey. This film was produced by Fugue State Films and released in 2010 on DVD with an accompanying CD with recordings by Daniel Moult of music by William Byrd, Thomas Tomkins, John Blow, Henry Purcell, George Frideric Handel, John Stanley and Samuel Wesley. At the time of its release it was reviewed in The Organists' Review as follows: ‚ÄúThis is eloquently articulated, well-paced playing, which reaches far. Moult‚Äôs performance of Purcell‚Äôs Double Organ Voluntary in D minor is lovely in its maturity and flexibility.‚Äù His second film was Virtuoso! Music for Organ. He performed a programme of virtuosic works by Marcel Dupre, Franz Schmidt, Jehan Alain, Jean Langlais, Maurice Durufle as well as works by contemporary composers Ad Wammes, Graeme Koehne and Andries van Rossem. This was recorded on the organ of Bridlington Priory and released in 2010. Choir and Organ Magazine reviewed it, writing: ‚ÄúTo the lay observer, he risks making it all look deceptively easy; but this is a DVD that serious students of the organ will want to revisit for an object lesson in the unfussy performance of some fiendishly difficult repertoire.‚Äù Gramophone magazine reviewed it as \\"a thrilling production...allowing one to marvel even more at Moult's exhilarating musicianship\\". He is currently developing \\"The Imperial English Organ\\", a follow-up to The Elusive English Organ, which follows the story of the English organ and its repertoire from Handel to the present day, and tells the history of England from the point of view of the pipe organ from the Eighteenth to Twenty-First centuries.

It was offered for sale to the public by RMB Motors of Barwell, Leicestershire from 1974, the original prototype having been completed at the end of 1973. 15 kits were supplied in this first year, rising to over 80 per year produced in 1979. The company was formed by Roger Blockley who had worked for the Triumph Car Company. The car was built on the chassis of a Triumph Herald using an angle iron framework which supported aluminum over marine ply body tub panels, aluminum bonnet, engine bay sides and 'fuel tank', with fibreglass wings and doors. The radiator grille was frequently sourced from an MG Magnette ZA/ZB. From 1975 a version was made to fit the Triumph Spitfire chassis and running gear, but only 2 of this variant were ever produced. The rights to the car were sold in 1989 to S.P. Motors founded by Gentry owners, Mick Sinclair and Terry Phillips and they developed a Ford-based version of the car. Mick Sinclair left the company in 1997 and the name changed to TP Motors who modified the design to take parts from the Ford Sierra. In 2001 the factory unit was sold and the company closed selling the design in 2002 to the Vintage Motor Car Company based in Doncaster, Yorkshire but few if any cars were made. In 2008 the design moved to new owners Geoff and Ellen Beston who formed the Gentry Car Company based in Nuneaton and restarted production. The company and all rights were sold on again in early 2019 and The Gentry Motor Car Company Ltd was reformed. The Gentry is back in production and the new owners, based in Coventry, are actively looking at additional engine options to complement the original whilst maintaining the MG / Triumph heritage. 2019 marks the 45th anniversary of the car.

It was designed by the architect C. J. Phipps as part of a larger development that included the rebuilding of Her Majesty's Theatre, which is adjacent to the hotel site. The Carlton was originally run by the Swiss hotelier C√©sar Ritz, with Auguste Escoffier as the head chef. In its early days it was one of London's most fashionable hotels and drew some customers away from the Savoy Hotel, which Ritz and Escoffier had previously managed. The hotel lost some of its prestige after Ritz retired, but continued to trade profitably until it was badly damaged by German bombing in 1940. The British government requisitioned the building in 1942. After the Second World War the shareholders of the hotel sold the lease of the site, and the surviving parts of the building were demolished in 1957‚Äì58. The site is now occupied by the 17-storey block of New Zealand High Commission. History =Origins= C. J. Phipps's drawings for the new hotel. The adjacent Her Majesty's Theatre is shown in outline on the right. The site, on the corner of the Haymarket and Pall Mall, part of the Crown Estate, was leased by the Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues to the Earl of Dudley. Dudley died in 1885, when the lease had six years left to run. In 1890, the Commissioners entered into a building agreement with the property developer Tod Heatley to redevelop the site. After prolonged negotiation and litigation, the development was taken over in 1895 by Law Guarantee and Trust Society, Ltd, which commissioned the theatre architect C. J. Phipps to draw up plans to rebuild Her Majesty's Theatre and to construct a hotel on the site alongside. The actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree agreed to take a lease of the theatre, the Office of Woods approved the plans, and building started in July 1896.Sheppard, F. H. W. \\"The Haymarket Opera House\\", Survey of London, British History Online, accessed 8 June 2011 When building work began, C√©sar Ritz and Auguste Escoffier were employed by Richard D'Oyly Carte as manager and chef de cuisine respectively at the Savoy Hotel. They were already planning to set up independently, and had established the Ritz Hotel Development Company, when Carte dismissed them both in 1897 for financial irregularities.Ashburner, F. \\"Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846‚Äì1935)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, May 2011, accessed 9 June 2011 After successfully opening the H√¥tel Ritz in Paris the following year, Ritz agreed to take a 72-year Crown lease of the new hotel in London. A limited company, The Carlton Hotel, Limited, was formed. The name Carlton comes from Carlton House, the nearby former home of the Prince Regent. The company's prospectus stated: Palm Court of the Carlton, 1899, captioned in The Illustrated London News as \\"A Fashionable Resort of Today\\" Construction of the hotel was not yet complete when Phipps died in 1897. The architectural partnership of Lewis Isaacs and Henry L. Florence were appointed to complete the building. The Survey of London quoted a contemporary critic, Edwin Sachs, who commented on the hotel and theatre: \\"The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building.\\" The Survey adds, however: \\"Present-day connoisseurs of late-Victorian architecture are less censorious, and many will regret the partial demolition of a building which, though overspiced with eclectic details, had considerable panache.\\"Although the hotel no longer survives, it was part of a single fa√ßade with the adjoining theatre, which remains intact. In the prospectus, the directors of The Carlton Hotel Limited wrote, \\"Mr. Ritz and the Directors believe that the hotel and restaurant will at once take precedence of similar establishments in London.\\" The most conspicuous \\"similar establishment\\" was the Savoy, which found its status as London's most fashionable hotel under threat. F. Ashburner, a biographer of Escoffier, has written, \\"From its opening [the Carlton] attracted much of the Savoy's clientele, including the Prince of Wales and the Marlborough House set. It paid out a dividend of 7 per cent in its first year to its influential financial and aristocratic backers, and for many years it was considered the finest hotel in London.\\" =Twentieth century= Badge of The Carlton, 1903 Ritz's satisfaction at pulling ahead of the Savoy was short lived. At the height of the fame of the Carlton, Ritz was preparing to mark the coronation of Edward VII in 1902 with much-publicised and elaborate festivities when the king suddenly fell ill, and the coronation was postponed indefinitely. The shock caused Ritz to suffer a severe nervous breakdown and sent him into retirement, leaving Escoffier as the figurehead at the Carlton. Richard D'Oyly Carte had died in 1901, but his son Rupert D'Oyly Carte reinvigorated the Savoy Hotel and the other hotels in his ownership, such as Claridge's. When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, Carte secured the services of Fran√ßois Bonnaure, formerly chef at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris. The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, M. Joseph, a few years earlier.Daily Mirror, 10 June 1904, p. 16. Without Ritz, the Carlton had no hotelier of flair to compete with Carte. Nevertheless, with Escoffier presiding in the kitchens, the Carlton continued to be one of London's leading hotels, yielding substantial profits for its shareholders. Apart from two spells of poor results, the first in the early years of the First World War and the second at the beginning of the Great Depression, the Carlton remained profitable until the Second World War.\\"The Carlton\\", The Times, 7 November 1912, p. 17; 7 November 1913, p. 18, 26 November 1918, p. 12, 3 November 1921, p. 20, 27 October 1925, p. 22, 12 November 1931, p. 21, 25 October 1933, p. 21, and 16 December 1937, p. 24 The Manchester Guardian commented that the hotel's \\"grill room looked very old fashioned and glum in latter years, but still Mr. Andrew Mellon and other major millionaires thought it the only satisfactory place in London.\\"\\"Our London Correspondence\\", The Manchester Guardian, 21 October 1942, p. 4 The New Zealand High Commission, built on the former site of the Carlton The hotel was badly damaged by German bombing in 1940.

Athulathmudali was fatally shot while addressing a gathering, approximately 4 weeks ahead of the Provincial Council elections for the Western Province, May 1993. The investigation carried out by Sri Lanka Police and Scotland Yard separately concluded that the assassination was carried out by a Tamil youth named Appiah Balakrishnan alias Ragunathan, who was affiliated to LTTE. However these findings were widely disputed by people due to the political context of that time. In 1995, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appointed a presidential commission to probe the Athulathmudali assassination, which had been an election promise of her 1994 presidential election campaign. The final commission report submitted on October 7, 1997 pointed the finger at former President Ranasinghe Premadasa (1988‚Äì93) and security force personnel who were close to him as directly responsible for the killing of Athulathmudali. Subsequently, a few security force members and underworld figures were arrested. They were eventually charged with conspiracy, aiding and abetting to commit murder. Three of the accused were killed during prosecution, raising further questions about the assassination. The Lalith Athulathmudali case remains the most controversial political assassination in recent Sri Lankan history. Background =Tension with Ranasinghe Premadasa= Lalith Athulathmudali had been one of the most prominent and powerful ministers in President J.R. Jayewardene‚Äôs government during 1977-88. Athulathmudali, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa and minister of Mahaweli Development Gamini Dissanayake were considered to be the closest contenders for the 1988 Sri Lankan presidential election. Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa was nominated in the end. After the election victory of President Premadasa, Athulathmudali and Dissanayake were considered as the closest contenders to the post of Prime Minister. But circumventing both of them, Premadasa appointed D.B. Wijethunga as the Prime Minister. In 1989, Premadasa appointed his closest associate Sirisena Cooray to the post of national organizer of UNP overlooking Lalith Athulathmudali. Similarly, Athulathmudali and Dissanayake were deprived of a series of important posts within government and the party. These acts caused a great tension between Premadasa fraction and the Athulathmudali fraction of the party. The disappearance of dramatist Luxman Perera ‚Äì who was a close ally of Athulathmudali, also caused the rift to intensify. =Impeachment motion= This resulted in Athulathmudali fraction bringing an impeachment motion against President Premadasa in 1991. The motion included 24 cases of alleged abuses of power, including illegal land deals and failing to consult the cabinet (thus violating the constitution). Although the speaker of the parliament rejected the motion in October 1991, it put the Premadasa government in grave danger. Subsequently, Athulathmudali and Dissanayake resigned from their ministerial posts. They and their allies were expelled from the party. =Establishment of Democratic United National Front= They formed a separate political party known as Democratic United National Front (DUNF) in November 28, 1991. Athulathmudali was elected as its leader. Four times during 1991-92, Athulathmudali and his supporters were physically attacked allegedly by thugs or supporters of the president. These incidents occurred on November 2, 1991 at Pannala, April 23, 1992 at Madapatha, August 7, 1992 at Fort railway station and August 29, 1992 at Dehiwala. On March 16, 1993, the government dissolved the seven provincial councils and announced the elections dates due to be on May 17, 1993. Athulathmudali handed over his papers to contest, seeking the chief ministership of the Western Province Council on the DUNF ticket. The assassination On April 23, 1993, Athulathmudali was scheduled to address meetings held at Borella, Aluthkade and Kirulapana. He finished addressing two other meetings and arrived at Kirulapana at 8:00 p.m. There were about 1,000 people present. As it was raining, people moved closer to the stage, some even climbing under it. Suddenly, the assassin came near Athulathmudali, pulled out a gun and shot him three times. At this moment, a bodyguard of Athulathmudali named Thilak Shantha fired at the assassin and hit him on the right side of his abdomen. The assassin also shot at the bodyguard and ran away. Athulathmudali was taken to the hospital but succumbed to his wounds around 8:50 p.m. The police came to the crime scene and cordoned the area. Subsequent search operations found nothing. On the following morning (April 24), the police found a slain body some 200m from the stage where Athulathmudali had been shot. Police found an automatic 9mm pistol with two magazines and several rounds of live ammunition, empty cartridge cases, a hand grenade, a national identity card and a little money. The Colombo Judicial Medical Officer, Dr. L.B. De Alwis, held a postmortem and recorded the cause of the death of Athulathmudali as fatal firearm wounds to the liver, heart and lungs. He identified the cause of the death of the slain Tamil youth, Appiah Balakrishnan alias Ragunathan, as cyanide poisoning. There was a non-fatal wound found on his lower back (not on the right abdomen as described by the bodyguard Thilak Shantha). Police investigation Police investigators immediately pointed their fingers at LTTE, a separatist terrorist organisation which had been waging a war against the state since 1983. When Athulathmudali had been the minister of defense in the J.R. Jayawardene government, he had taken stern action against the group, sparking their anger towards him. LTTE had killed a number of parliamentarians and local body members during the period, so the police's point of view had a certain credibility. The police asserted that Ragunathan, whose body had appeared the next morning, was the gunman who had killed Athulathmudali. The fact that the Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Lalantha de Alwis, who conducted the autopsy on the body, had testified that the body smelled of potassium cyanide (which LTTEers had used over the years to commit suicide) and that he found pieces of glass in the mouth of the body, stood as strong evidence to support the police. Police determined that the youth known as Ragunathan was a LTTE activist. According to their view, LTTE had sent Ragunathan to kill Athulathmudali, and Ragunathan then bit his suicide capsule to evade capture, since he had been shot by the bodyguard. Scotland Yard investigation President Ranasinghe Premadasa invited a team of Scotland Yard detectives and pathologists to further investigate the assassination. They arrived in the country on April 26. During their course of investigation, on May 1, 1993, President Premadasa was killed by a suicide bombing carried out by the LTTE. Scotland Yard reported to the then appointed D.B. Wijethunge government that they had found a minute trace of cyanide in Ragunathan's blood sample which they had taken at a second postmortem of the youth. Concluding their investigation, detective superintendent Alec Edwards of the Investigation and Crime Branch of New Scotland Yard forwarded an undated report to the government. =The findings of Scotland Yard= The report included the following findings: *The person now known to be Ragunathan, alias Appaiah Balakrishnan, shot and killed Athulathmudali and was later found dead at scene 2. *Seriously injured and fearing imminent capture, he undoubtedly took his life by way of cyanide poisoning. *There was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support the allegation that this tragedy was orchestrated by or in any way linked to the Sri Lankan Government, UNP members or other official agencies including the police. *An analytical study of LTTE's modus operandi showed that this act was in total concert with their current subversive activities. Controversy The circumstances regarding the death of Athulathmudali remained intensely controversial in the social and political arenas. The following facts made the official version of the assassination suspicious. *It was reported that Rukman de Silva, a Senior Superintendent of Police, had instructed his officers not to provide police protection to the opposition political parties at their public meetings during the provincial election. *On April 23, the Inspector of Police, Ranagala, who was the OIC of Kirulapone, sent two police officers to tape record the speeches made at the DUNF meeting. *A police search found nothing on the night of the assassination. It was only on the following morning that Kirulapana police found the dead body of Ragunathan just 200m from the stage. *For the second postmortem done by Dr. R.T. Shepherd on Ragunathan's body, no one had taken permission from the magistrate, which was absolutely necessary under the circumstances. *It was found that Ragunathan had come to Colombo to go abroad. He was alone. There was no evidence to link him to the LTTE. Those pieces of evidence, combined with the political friction between Athulathmudali and President Premadasa, made many independent investigators suspicious about an involvement of the president with this assassination. However, Premadasa repeatedly pleaded his innocence. He also made the favourite statement, \\"Assassinate me if you wish, but don't assassinate my character, which I have cherished from my childhood,\\" regarding Athulathmudali's murder. Presidential commission on Athulathmudali assassination In 1994, Chandrika Kumarathunga's People's Alliance government came into power, defeating the 17 year UNP rule. One of the major election promises of her 1994 presidential election campaign was to inquire the unaccounted disappearances and assassinations during UNP's rule. Thus in 1995, she appointed a 3-person presidential commission to probe the death of Athulathmudali. It was composed of justice Tissa Bandaranayake, justice Padmasiri Gunasekera and judge of the High Court, Nimal Gamini Amaratunge. Although the commission was due to submit report in 3 months time, it took more than 2 years to complete the investigation. Commission submitted its final report on October 7, 1997. The commission found that the firearm wound on Ragunathan was caused by a shot fired at a very close range with a doctored and tampered 9 mm cartridge. For this to have happened he should‚Äôve been in someone's captivity when he was shot. This is because the bodyguard had shot the killer at a distance greater than that. Ragunathan had his wound on his lower back, not on the right side of the abdomen. The commission also concluded that evidence gathered suggests that cyanide was administered to him forcibly, not that he bit the cyanide capsule himself. It also ruled out LTTE from the assassination plot. Commission also pointed out that Ragunathan was also killed by the gang which had killed Athulathmudali. =The persons implicated by the commission= It implicated following people for the dual murder: *Arambawalage Don Ranjith Upali de Silva alias Soththi Upali ‚Äì he was implicated on murdering victim number 2, Appiah Balakrishnan alias Ragunathan. Soththi Upali was assumed to be the god father of the Colombo underworld during that time. He had been said to have close political links, most importantly B. Sirisena Cooray, the minister of housing and construction at that time. Upali served as a reserve sub inspector at one time. He was later included in the UNP executive body by President Premadasa. *Uswatte Liyanage Senivaratne - a provincial councilor of the UNP for the Western Province. He was accused of the offences of unlawful assault, voluntarily causing hurt while being armed with deadly weapons to wit; pistol, iron rods, clubs etc. and wrongful restraint, criminal intimidation, offences punishable under the Penal Code in respect of the Fort Railway Station incident on August 7, 1992, and conspiracy to kill Lalith W. Athulathmudali on April 23, 1993. *Janaka Priyanka Jayamanna alias Wellampitiye Sudumahattaya ‚Äì he was identified as the assassin of Lalith Athulathmudali. *Wathudula Bandulage Somaratne alias Konda Some ‚Äì another prominent underworld figure. *K. Nandasiri Karunatilake alias Nandana ‚Äì a mobster and a close associate of Soththi Upali. *Bulathsinhalage Srisena Cooray - the minister of Housing and Construction of the Premadasa government. He was considered as the right-hand man of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. *Bulathsinhalage Ajith Coorey - the son of Srisena Cooray. =Negligence/involvement of police= The commission report also added that the Police has contributed to the assassination by failing to give adequate security to the meeting, disregard of vital evidence, not submitting a complete report to the magistrate and avoiding questioning witnesses on relevant matters. Report also implicated ASP Lugoda, IP Dharmawardene, SI Sunil Shantha and IP Ekhanayake on falsification and tampering of evidence and fraudulent conduct. Senivaratne, Gunaratne, Dharmawardene, Basil, Jayasinghe, Devasundara, Aabdeen, Nilaabdeen, Deepthi Wijewickrema and other CDB officers were accused of conducting an unsatisfactory probe on Ragunathan's death. Galgamuwa of the Wellawatte police is seen showing weapons to underworld gagsters at the police station. Adhikari of the Borella police had given protection to criminals, particularly to Soththi Upali, whom he addressed as \\"chief\\". Devasundara and Ilabdeen visited Ragunathan, who was held in captivity in Gothami Road. The report in its last paragraphs pointed out finger towards President Premadasa for the assassination of Lalith Athulathmudali. Based on the commission report, on September 8, 1998 Devasundara, Inspector of Police in charge of the local unit of the Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) was arrested in Anuradhapura. Later Soththi Upali, Malwatte Some, U.L. Seneviratne, B.G. Devasurendra and A. Abdeen were arrested and charged with conspiracy, aiding and abetting to commit murder and unlawful detention of Ragunathan. B. Sirisena Cooray was also arrested later and released. He continues to deny their involvement of the assassination until now. Subsequently, three of the chief suspects, Arambawalage Don Ranjith Upali de Silva alias Soththi Upali, Janaka Priyanka Jayamanna alias Wellampitiye Sudumahattaya and K. Nandasiri Karunatilake alias Nandana were assassinated. Circumstances regarding Soththi Upali‚Äôs death Soththi Upali was shot dead on December 17, 1998 while returning home from the magistrate courts in Colombo, where he has been charged in connection with the assassination. It was reported that two vehicles have followed the bus in which Upali was traveling from Colombo to Piliyandala. As soon as he got down at Bokundara, he was shot and then dragged into one of the vehicles and taken to a place about 4 km from Bokundara, shot again and dropped. Prior to that, in late February 1998 at Borella, Nandana was killed at the presence of Upali. But he had luckily got escaped. A rival underworld gang led by Dhammika Amarasinghe, the brother of Upali's archrival Chinthaka Amarasinghe ‚Äì who was killed by Upali, a few years earlier ‚Äì was said to be responsible for these assassinations. Thilak Shantha‚Äôs confession When those who were implicated by the presidential commission were tried in court, it was revealed that the assassin named by the commission, Wellampitye Sudumahattaya had no wounds on the right side of his abdomen, as earlier revealed by Lalith Athulathmudali's bodyguard Thilak Shantha. Thus Shantha was recalled to the court to question him on the issue. There he confessed that he had deliberately lied to the commission and the early investigators. He said the truth was that he shot at the assassin, but the bullet never hit the assassin. He said he lied to the commission and to the police at the instance of a President's Counsel who was watching the interests of Athulathmudali's family. Later Shantha was charged as an accomplice to the murder. Aftermath The assassin of Lalith Athulathmudali, as implicated by commission, Janaka Priyankara Jayamanne alias Wellampitiye Sudu Mahattaya also was assassinated by rival underworld gangs at his Kolonnawa home on April 30, 2000. His wife also died in this shooting. Chandrika Kumarathunga's government was accused of giving asylum to the gangs led by Dhammika Amarasinghe who was responsible for these murders. In 2005, a suspect was apprehended by Police in relation to Soththi Upali's murder. Interrogations revealed that he had been a body guard of the former Samurdi Minister S. B. Dissanayake who had been a powerful minister of Chandrika Kumarathunga's government.

He is also a writer for screen, television and radio. Craig is best known for his plays What We Did To Weinstein (Menier Chocolate Factory, London, 2005), which earned him a Most Promising Playwright Nomination at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards; The Glass Room (Hampstead Theatre, 2006), which deals with Holocaust denial; and The Holy Rosenbergs (National Theatre, 2011); as well as for writing the English version of Tadeusz S≈Çobodzianek's Our Class (National Theatre, 2009). His most recent play is the semi-autobiographical Filthy Business (Hampstead Theatre, 2017). Early life Craig was born near Hampstead Heath, London, to parents of Jewish, Dutch and Northern Irish heritage. His father worked in the family rubber retail business, depicted in Craig's 2017 play Filthy Business. When Craig was two he moved with his family to the up-and-coming suburb of Mill Hill in North West London and attended first Radlett Prep and then Haberdashers' Aske's in Elstree. For his twelfth birthday a school friend bought him the text of Harold Pinter's The Caretaker, of which he writes: ‚ÄúIt blew my mind. The language, the anger, the humour. So close to the rhythms of my East End Jewish family.‚ÄùA personal email from Ryan Craig, 8.3.18. See also Jessie Thompson, ‚ÄúPlay Talk: Ryan Craig on writing about Jewish identity and exposing yourself in your writing,‚Äù Evening Standard Arts, 21 March 2017. Craig describes his family as ‚Äúloud, talkative, argumentative, and possibly too close for its own good.‚ÄùA personal email from Ryan Craig, 8.3.18. Craig studied for a BA in History and Philosophy at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1994. In 1996, he completed an MA program in Contemporary Theatre Practice run by Jonathan Lichtenstein at the University of Essex. There he studied with Mike Alfreds and Annie Castledine among others. Career in theatre =Early works= Craig's first play, The Sins of Dalia Baumgarten, was written for a directing project at Essex (1995). It is set predominantly in the ladies‚Äô toilet at a Jewish wedding, and all of the characters have a secular London Jewish background, as do many of the characters in his subsequent plays. The Sins of Dalia Baumgarten was produced in June 1996 in London at the Etcetera Theatre, Camden. Described by Edward Simpkins in What's On as a portrait of a \\"drunken but cathartic social swirl\\",What's On, 12 June 1996. it caught the attention of Jack Bradley, at the time the literary manager of the National Theatre, and Bradley encouraged Craig to keep writing. Craig next wrote Happy Savages, which John Peter in the Sunday Times characterized as a \\"tough, bruising play about vulnerable, bruised people\\".Sunday Times, 9 August 1998. It was produced at the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith in 1998, with a cast including Kris Marshall and Hermione Gulliford, and after this Bradley offered Craig an eight-week writing attachment at the National Theatre Studio. There followed an adaptation of Tom Sharpe's novel Vintage Stuff, in a touring production, and Three Servants, presented in 2002 at the Warehouse in Croydon. For Time Out reviewer Lucy Powell, the latter was a \\"neat, tightly choreographed play\\" inspired by \\"Japanese comic theatre, commedia dell'arte and The Arabian Nights\\".Time Out, 13 November 2002. =Professional breakthrough= Craig's next play, What We Did To Weinstein, deals with a Jewish son returning from a traumatic event in the West Bank to tend to his famous writer father. Directed by Tim Supple, it premiered at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2005 and earned Craig a Most Promising Playwright Nomination at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards. Nicholas de Jongh's review for the Evening Standard commented that the play \\"fascinates because it reflects the complex passions of Jews in more than two minds about what Jewishness entails\\".Evening Standard, 27 September 2005. Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph praised its \\"theatrical vitality\\" and \\"vividly drawn characters\\", commenting that its \\"vaultingly ambitious\\" approach suggested parallels with recent work by Mike Leigh and David Edgar.Daily Telegraph, 29 September 2005. Also in 2005, Craig's play Broken Road won a Fringe First at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The play was set entirely in a moving car, prompting the Scotsman's reviewer Jay Richardson to call it \\"genuinely edge-of-the-seatbelt stuff\\".Scotsman, 26 August 2005. The production, directed by Carrie Cracknell, briefly transferred later that year to Battersea Arts Centre. Craig's next stage play was The Glass Room (directed by Anthony Clark at Hampstead Theatre, 2006), which deals with Holocaust denial. Its two main characters are a historian, Elena, who denies that the Nazi gas chambers existed, and Myles, a human rights lawyer who defends her freedom of speech when she faces prosecution under new laws. Claire Allfree in Metro identified \\"verbal sparring\\" as the play's essential feature and argued that \\"Craig raises some excellent points about historical imperialism and the problem of maintaining individual freedom within a culture that believes in religious tolerance\\".Metro, 30 November 2006. Susannah Clapp of the Observer, who considered the play \\"adroitly phrased and arresting but too neatly patterned\\", commented that \\"Ryan Craig has carved out a distinctive dramatic niche for himself by writing debates about 21st-century Jewishness\\".Observer, 3 December 2016. =Work at the National Theatre= In 2009, Craig wrote an English version of Tadeusz S≈Çobodzianek's Holocaust play Our Class, which was staged at the National Theatre. The cast of Bijan Sheibani's production included Amanda Hale, Paul Hickey, Edward Hogg, Sinead Matthews, Justin Salinger and Jason Watkins. Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph noted that \\"Bijan Sheibani's production of Ryan Craig's English version has a sober, documentary feel\\" and argued that it is the characters' \\"stark words ... that make the evening so chilling\\".Daily Telegraph, 25 September 2009. Susannah Clapp in the Observer praised Craig's having \\"subtly translated\\" S≈Çobodzianek,Observer, 27 September 2009. and John Nathan in the Jewish Chronicle referred to Craig \\"elegantly\\" rendering S≈Çobodzianek's original.Jewish Chronicle, 2 October 2009. Craig's next play was The Holy Rosenbergs, which premiered at the National Theatre in 2011, directed by Laurie Sansom and starring Henry Goodman. It centres on the North London Rosenberg family, kosher caterers, on the eve of their son's funeral. Danny, a pilot in the Israeli air-force, had been killed in action over Gaza; his sister, Ruth, is a lawyer investigating alleged human rights abuses by the Israeli Defence Forces. The play examines family conflict, guilt and the impact of Israeli politics within the London Jewish community. Critics compared the play to Arthur Miller's All My Sons and Death of a Salesman,See Michael Billington, ‚ÄúThe Holy Rosenbergs ‚Äì review,‚Äù The Guardian, 16 March 2011; Charles Spencer, ‚ÄúThe Holy Rosenbergs, National Theatre, review,‚Äù The Telegraph, 17 March 2011; David Benedict, ‚ÄúReview: ‚ÄòThe Holy Rosenbergs,‚Äô Variety, 17 March 2011; Paul Taylor, ‚ÄúThe Holy Rosenbergs, National Theatre: Cottesloe, London,‚Äù Independent, 18 March 2011; John Nathan, ‚ÄúCraig discovers his rubber soul,‚Äù The Jewish Chronicle, 17 March 2017. and Craig indeed shares Miller's obsession with achieving ethical clarity in a nebulous world. Writing for The Arts Desk, Aleks Sierz applauded a play that \\"buzzes with discussion and debate\\", concluding that \\"In the clarity of its construction, the tension of its climax and the slow unveiling of its emotional core, this is a very fine play indeed\\".https://theartsdesk.com/theatre/holy-rosenbergs-national- theatre In The Times, Libby Purves wrote that \\"The play educates and provokes\\" and \\"is startlingly fair\\" ‚Äì \\"clear, gripping, moving, at times extremely funny, and important\\".The Times, 17 March 2011. From January 2012 to March 2013 Craig was Writer in Residence at the National Theatre Studio. =Recent work= In 2017, Craig's play Filthy Business premiered at Hampstead Theatre, directed by Edward Hall and starring Sara Kestelman. Reviewing it in the Evening Standard, Henry Hitchings described it as \\"meaty\\", a \\"portrait of a volatile family ... spanning the years 1968 to 1982\\" that \\"pictures social change through the prism of commerce\\" and takes particular interest in \\"toxic tribalism\\".Evening Standard, 17 March 2017. In the Daily Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish praised it as \\"valiant and valuable, daring to show Jewish folk on the make, warts and all\\".Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2017. The play premiered in New Zealand, in a production by Auckland Theatre Company, in 2018.https://www.atc.co.nz/auckland-theatre-company/2017-18/filthy-business/ Craig's comedy Games for Lovers premiered at Waterloo's Vaults in the summer of 2019, directed by Anthony Banks, with a cast including Evanna Lynch and Billy Postlethwaite. In the Guardian, Miriam Gillinson summed it up as a portrait of \\"four young people [who] scour the internet and hang out in bars, searching madly for love in all the wrong places\\" and commented that \\"A giddy carefreeness underpins this light-hearted new comedy about love in the internet age ‚Äì it feels as if everyone is cutting loose for the summer.\\"Guardian, 19 July 2019. Thematic focus of Craig's plays Craig was a founder member of a group of playwrights known as the \\"Monsterists\\", whose philosophy was expounded by David Eldridge in an article for the Guardian in 2005. The other members, besides Eldridge, included Richard Bean, Moira Buffini, Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Colin Teevan and Roy Williams. Among the principles of Monsterism were a commitment to large-scale drama unafraid of ambitious concepts and \\"the elevation of new theatre writing from the ghetto of the studio 'black box' to the main stage\\".https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jun/27/theatre In an article entitled ‚ÄúWesker‚Äôs Dream‚Äù (2014),A review of Daniel Kanaber‚Äôs play Shiver at the Watford Palace, published in the Jewish Quarterly 61/1, 2014: 52-53. Craig discussed his preoccupations as a writer and confirmed that his ‚Äútheme is often the struggle between family, community and individual identity‚Äù and that while he often concentrates ‚Äúon the rituals and codes of a North London Jewish family‚Äù, his target audience is not necessarily immigrant communities. ‚ÄúI believe such plays can redefine what it is to be British,‚Äù he writes, and he reflects on the difficulties inherent in writing about Jewish subjects for an audience in Britain today. Interviewed in 2017 by Jessie Thompson for the Evening Standard, Craig remarked, \\"Just a cursory look at my output thus far will show a preoccupation with the theme of Jewish identity. I feel like the senile, old father in Wallander, obsessively painting the exact same section of forest, but with a different mood.\\"Jessie Thompson, ‚ÄúPlay Talk: Ryan Craig on writing about Jewish identity and exposing yourself in your writing,‚Äù Evening Standard Arts, 21 March 2017. Other writing Craig's television work includes the Channel 4 drama Saddam's Tribe, in which Stanley Townsend played Saddam Hussein, as well as episodes of The Musketeers, Robin Hood, Hustle, and Waterloo Road (BBC). Craig was writer in residence at BBC Radio Drama in 2005. His radio plays include A Question of Judgement, English in Afghanistan, The Lysistrata Project, Hold My Breath, Portugal, The Great Pursuit and Looking for Danny.

The reserve and island is named for the Cabbage-tree Palms in the two gullies on the island's western side which are the nesting site of Goulds petrel. It is the principal breeding site of the nominate subspecies of the threatened Gould's petrel and, with the nearby Boondelbah Island where there is also a small colony, has been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Description Cabbage Tree Island is a small and rugged island, about long, on a north-south alignment, by wide. It rises abruptly to a height of . The tree vegetation includes, as well as the cabbage-tree palms, deciduous and sandpaper figs, native plums, and bird-lime trees.  History  In 1911, a penguin chick was captured on Cabbage Tree Island and taken to Maitland where an attempt was made to raise it as a pet. Attitudes towards nature evolved during the 20th century, and the island's importance for conservation was formally recognised. = Conservation = Both Cabbage Tree and Boondelbah Islands are gazetted nature reserves under the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Act, so protecting the island's habitat from land uses incompatible with nature conservation. Access is only permitted for scientific and conservation purposes. Cabbage Tree Island, NSW, west side =Gould's petrel conservation management= Gould's petrel in flightThe petrels nest mainly in natural rock crevices among the rock scree of two gullies on the western side of the island, but also in hollow fallen palm trunks, beneath mats of fallen palm fronds and in cavities among fig tree buttresses. They breed in colonies with the nests often less than apart. Before significant active management of the island commenced, the breeding population was in decline. One major contributing factor was the presence of rabbits which largely destroyed the understorey vegetation of the island and prevented its regeneration. The removal of the sheltering understorey vegetation by rabbits led to increased exposure of the ground-nesting petrels and predation by pied currawongs and Australian ravens. It also led to increased mortality following entanglement of the birds with the sticky fruits of the bird-lime trees which fell to the ground rather than being caught in the understorey. By 1992 there were fewer than 250 breeding pairs of Gould's petrel nesting on the Island, fewer than 20% of the pairs were producing fledglings, fewer than 50 young were being produced each year, and adult mortality exceeded 50 birds each year. Remedial management from 1992 onwards has included the eradication of rabbits on the island in 1997/98 and the removal of bird-lime trees from petrel nesting habitat, as well as the culling of currawongs and ravens. After a few pairs of Gould's petrels were discovered on Boondelbah Island in 1995, to the south, a translocation program was implemented to supplement the new breeding site with fledglings from Cabbage Tree. By 2004/05 it was estimated that the breeding colony on Cabbage Tree Island had increased to 2,500 individuals comprising 1,000 breeding pairs, that an average of 300 fledglings are produced annually, that 50% of pairs are producing fledged young, and average adult mortality is less than ten birds a year.\\"Gould's Petrel\\", Ockham's Razor See also * List of islands of New South Wales * Protected areas of New South Wales References Category:Islands of New South Wales Category:Island restoration Category:Important Bird Areas of New South Wales Category:Nature reserves in New South Wales Category:Mid-Coast Council Category:Uninhabited islands of Australia ","title":"Cabbage Tree Island"},{"id":"32029091","text":"Millersburg is a village that serves as the county seat of Holmes County, Ohio, United States located south of Cleveland. The population was 3,025 at the 2010 census. Holmes County Airport, located two miles southwest of Millersburg, serves the county. History The Old Town of Millersburg was laid out by Adam Johnson and Charles Miller of Coshocton County in November 1815. It was located at the north side of the northwest quarter of Section 12, township 9, range 7 adjoining the School Lands, and very near the northwest corner of said quarter section. The Northwest corner, lot 1, was a little over the hill towards the present mill dam and the northeast corner, lot 9, was about 100 steps west of the present Wooster Road. The center of the town was very nearly the center of Walkups Addition. The principal streets were Bridge, High and Market, each four rods wide. The direction of the former was east and west, and ll rods south of the school land; and was located on the State Road east and west through the county, that crosses the Killbuck near the present mill dam. Thomas Haskins was the first settler on the town plat, settling there in the spring of 1819, on lot 21, corner of Bridge and High streets. In the spring of 1820, James Withrow erected a one-and-a-half-story building on Lot 33 cornering on Bridge and High streets and diagonally across them from the Haskins tavern. In late 1820 a cabin was erected in the northeast corner of the town for a school house. Joseph Edger of Berlin taught at the school that winter, and it was the first school in the town. During that winter the Rev. Harper, a Presbyterian minister, preached in the school house which was the first sermon delivered in Millersburg. On April 8, 1824, Andrew Johnston and Charles Miller filed a plan for the present town of Millersburg. \\"New Town\\" as it was referred to, was situated southeast of the original town of Millersburg (Old Town). The new plan laid out 194 lots. The center of this plan consisted of a block for public use. The main east‚Äìwest street was named Jackson. To the north of this was Clinton and to the south, Adams. The north‚Äìsouth streets were Mad Anthony, Washington, Clay, Monroe and Crawford with the main intersection being Clay and Jackson. The first two residences in the town were built by James French and William Painter. When Millersburg was accepted as the county seat of the newly formed Holmes County it began to prosper.The History of Millersburg by George Newton and Let's build a Town and Call it Millersburg from the Holmes County Heirs, March April 1987. In 1833, Millersburg contained ten stores, four taverns, four practicing physicians, three attorneys, one printing office, one meeting house, one apothecary's shop, and 73 dwelling houses. On April 1, 1892, an unidentified black male was lynched in Millersburg. Papers reported that he was the only black man in the county and had been \\"annoying people in various ways\\". The man was found hanged on the courthouse lawn one morning after several people heard noises during the night. Geography Millersburg is located at (40.554901, -81.917940), along Killbuck Creek.

Although concerns about dental treatment directed to babies have been reported at the beginning of the twentieth century, only recently the dental community started to focus on this area of Dentistry, due to the high dental caries (decay) prevalence observed in young children. The first setting for providing dental care exclusively to babies started in 1986, at Londrina's State University (Brazil), changing the concept from early treatment of carious lesions and their consequences to early educative-preventive attention. These concepts were disseminated through the entire country introducing new clinics with a similar philosophy such as the Baby Clinic of Ara√ßatuba Dental School, S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP), and also abroad. Clinical session at the Baby Clinic, Ara√ßatuba Dental School, Brazil Aims The general aim of Dentistry for babies is to provide dental assistance to 0 ‚Äì 3 year-old children, through an educative-preventive Oral Health programme directed to parents and children comprising the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and control of the most common clinical situations at this age range (dental caries, dental trauma, alterations of tooth development, etc.). Protocol: ‚Äì Meetings with parents At the Baby Clinic of Ara√ßatuba Dental School, parents are required to enroll their babies from birth up to 6 months of age. Prior to the first clinical session, parents attend a lecture providing general information about: \\\\- Oral health within the context of systemic health; \\\\- The importance of the deciduous teeth; \\\\- Non-nutritive sucking habits (thumb and pacifier); \\\\- Dental trauma: what to do if it happens; \\\\- Dental caries as a disease, and the possibility of its prevention; \\\\- Early childhood caries; \\\\- Caries prevention; \\\\- Professional treatment x home care; \\\\- How does the Baby Clinic work? Meetings occur on a regular basis. At the end of them, parents are demonstrated how to clean the baby's mouth and how to use a fluoridated solution. Following, the baby's first appointment is booked. ‚Äì First appointment (comprises): Anamnesis General clinical examination, which will evaluate the baby's health as a whole. If necessary, the baby is referred to professionals of other areas for further examination. Determination of caries risk, by correlating information gathered through anamnesis, clinical examination, along with environmental factors. a) Influence of diet: night time feeding, consumption of cariogenic foods and beverages. b) Influence of hygiene: presence of visible dental plaque (biofilm), presence and quality of oral hygiene procedures. c) Use of fluorides. d) Oral health status of parents (especially mother). Oral examination Specific educative orientation will be directed to parents according to the needs ‚Äì baby's caries risk. Caries risk must be determined in this first appointment. The type of assistance to be provided to the baby will depend on the risk. For low caries risk children, the aim is to maintain the baby's of oral health. Clinical sessions include hygiene with Hydrogen peroxide (1 part of H2O2 \\\\+ 3 parts of boiled or filtered water) and application of 0.1% sodium fluoride (NaF) solution using cotton swab. At home, parents/caregivers are instructed to keep the same dietary and hygiene habits, and apply a 0.05% NaF solution once/day with a cotton swab at night time, before the baby is put to sleep. Recalls are booked quarterly. At the first recall session, the caregiver will be asked to perform the hygiene procedures and to apply the fluoridated solution under professional supervision, in order to evaluate how skilled he/she is in performing those tasks, as well as to correct possible mistakes. If caries risk remains low, a quarterly scheme can be kept. Oral hygiene of an edentulous baby's mouth with gauze and hydrogen peroxide Application of 0.1% NaF solution with a cotton swab For high caries risk children, the aim is to revert the baby's caries risk, as well as to increase tooth resistance. Clinical sessions include the identification and reversion of risk factors for caries ‚Äì parents are oriented on how to control (either eliminating or reducing) caries risk factors. Tooth resistance will be increased by applying a 0.1% NaF solution over all tooth surfaces. At home, parents/caregivers will adopt measures for oral hygiene and diet control, as well as remove bad oral hygiene and diet habits that increase the risk of caries development. Daily application of a 0.05% NaF solution will also be recommended. Recalls can be booked every 1 or 2 months. As for low caries risk children, the caregiver will be asked to perform the hygiene procedures and to apply the fluoridated solution under professional supervision, in order to evaluate how skilled he/she is in performing those tasks, as well as to correct possible mistakes. Caries risk must be evaluated again. Parents will be evaluated on how the recommendations done in the first session are being followed, which could potentially reduce the baby's caries risk. For children with caries lesions, the aims are to re-establish oral equilibrium, by eliminating or reducing causal factors, as well as by increasing tooth resistance. Four clinical sessions, with a 1-week interval, are performed, so the dentist is able to act over causal factors (instructing parents), to increase tooth resistance (hygiene with diluted H2O2 solution and gauze; application of fluoride varnish over white spot lesions and softened carious lesions), as well as to restore tooth cavities with glass ionomer cement (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment). At home, parents/caregivers will adopt measures for oral hygiene and diet control, as well as daily application of a 0.05% NaF solution. The first recall is booked after 1 month, when caries risk must be re-evaluated in order to determine the appropriate periodicity for recalls. At the first recall session, the caregiver will be asked to perform the hygiene procedures and to apply the fluoridated solution under professional supervision, in order to evaluate how skilled he/she is in performing those tasks, as well as to correct possible mistakes. Caries risk assessment will be performed on a regular basis regardless the initial caries risk evaluation, so changes in the protocol can be implemented whenever necessary.

He was the 32nd Archbishop of Manila from 2011 to 2019. Tagle also serves as the president of Caritas International, a federation of Catholic relief, development, and social service organizations, and of the Catholic Biblical Federation. Tagle, who generally prefers to be called by his nickname \\"Chito\\" rather than by his clerical title, has been involved in many social issues in the Philippines, with emphasis on helping the poor while defending the Catholic Church's opposition to abortion, contraception (equated with abortion in the Philippines), and what he has called \\"practical atheism\\". Dubbed as \\"Asian Francis\\" or \\"Asia's Catholic Superstar\\", he is often seen as a representative of the Church's progressive wing. Tagle has criticized the Church for using \\"harsh words\\" to describe LGBT as well as divorced and remarried Catholics, whom he believes should be allowed to receive Holy Communion on a case-by-case basis. Early life and studies Tagle was born on June 21, 1957, the eldest child of devout Catholic parents, Manuel Topacio Tagle, an ethnic Tagalog and his Chinese Filipino wife, Milagros Gokim, who previously worked for Equitable PCI Bank. Tagle's paternal grandfather, Florencio, came from Imus, Cavite; the Tagle family were from the Hispanic, lowland Christian aristocracy known as the Principal√≠a, which were the elite prior to the 1896 Philippine Revolution. Emilio Aguinaldo, Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan. Copyright by Mrs. Cristina Aguinaldo Suntay. Manila. 1964 Florencio was injured by a bomb explosion during the Second World War; Tagle's grandmother made a living by running a local diner. After completing elementary and high school at Saint Andrew's School in Para√±aque in 1973, he was influenced by priest friends to enter the Jesuit San Jos√© Seminary, which sent him to the Jesuit Ateneo de Manila University. Tagle earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in pre-divinity from Ateneo in 1977 and then a Master of Arts in theology at its Loyola School of Theology. Tagle earned his Doctorate in Sacred Theology at the Catholic University of America from 1987 to 1991. He wrote his dissertation under the direction of Joseph A. Komonchak on \\"Episcopal Collegiality in the Teaching and Practice of Paul VI\\". Tagle also attended doctrinal courses at the Institute of Pope Paul VI University. In Komonchak's estimation, Tagle was \\"one of the best students I had in over 40 years of teaching\\" and \\"could have become the best theologian in the Philippines, or even in all of Asia\\" had he not been appointed bishop. Tagle has received honorary degrees from Catholic Theological Union and La Salle University. Tagle is fluent in speaking his native Tagalog language, as well as the English and Italian languages. He is also proficient in reading Spanish, French, and Latin. Priesthood Tagle was ordained in the Diocese of Imus on February 27, 1982. After ordination, he held the following positions: associate pastor of San Agust√≠n Parish ‚Äì M√©ndez- N√∫√±ez, Cavite (1982‚Äì1984), spiritual director (1982‚Äì1983) and later rector (1983‚Äì1985) of the diocesan seminary of Imus. After studies in the United States from 1985 to 1992, he returned to Imus and was Episcopal Vicar for Religious (1993‚Äì1995) and parish priest and rector (1998‚Äì2001) of Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar Cathedral-Parish. He also taught theology at San Carlos Seminary (1982-1985) and Divine Word Seminary in Tagaytay, Cavite.Pope appoints Mgr. Tagle Archbishop of Manila. Asianews.it. Retrieved on February 18, 2012. Pope John Paul II appointed Tagle to the International Theological Commission, where he served from 1997 to 2002 under its President, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. From 1995 to 2001 he was a member of the editorial board of the \\"History of Vatican II\\" project. Bishop of Imus In 2001, Tagle was appointed Bishop of Imus on October 22 and consecrated on December 12 after previously serving as parish priest of the Cathedral-parish of Imus. During his ten years in Imus, he made a point of living simply, owned no car, and invited the destitute to join him for a meal. At the first gathering of bishops under Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, he spoke from the floor about the inadequacy of the number of priests in the Philippines. He said:\\"XI Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.\\" Holy See Press Office, October 2‚Äì23, 2005. Accessed December 14, 2015 To the concept that priestly vocation are a gift from God he countered: \\"we should also ask whether the Church is a good steward of the gift.\\" He told a news conference that \\"The first Sunday after my ordination as a priest, I said nine Masses, and that is regular in the Philippines.\\" Discussing priestly celibacy, Cardinal Angelo Scola, the synod moderator, expressed reservations about modifications to the Church's requirement of celibacy for the priesthood. In response, Tagle suggested that the Church should consider such a change to combat the shortage of priests. At the 2008 International Eucharistic Congress in Quebec, Canada, he delivered a talk on the importance of the Eucharist that, by one report, moved the audience to tears. He contrasted Christian worship with false forms of adoration: Archbishop of Manila Cathedral-Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, metropolitan seat of Archbishop Tagle and the See of Manila, Philippines390x390px Tagle seated on the cathedra of the Manila Cathedral, 2014 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Tagle the 32nd Archbishop of Manila on October 13, 2011, to succeed Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales.Vatican Insider: \\"Pope appoints communicator and scholar as new Archbishop of Manila\\" October 13, 2011 According to Father Catalino Ar√©valo, SJ, the first Asian member of the Vatican's International Theological Commission, Tagle's appointment was promoted by the Papal Nuncio to the Philippines Edward Joseph Adams and by Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, but some objections were submitted to the Congregation for Bishops, which caused some delay in processing his appointment. Prior to his installation, Tagle made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in October 2011. He was installed as Archbishop on December 12, 2011, the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the tenth anniversary of his episcopal consecration. He received the pallium, the symbol of his authority as a metropolitan archbishop, from Pope Benedict XVI on June 29, 2012, in Rome. In February 2012, Tagle attended the Symposium for Healing and Renewal at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Tagle discussed the way the sex-abuse crisis manifests itself in Asia, where it is more common for priests to violate their vows of celibacy by taking mistresses than to engage in the sexual abuse of minors. Tagle maintained that the deference to authority typical of Asian culture combined with the dominance of the Catholic Church in a country like the Philippines produced a \\"culture of shame\\" that continued to inhibit the reporting of instances of abuse. He said that culture needed to change though he anticipated great difficulties: He said the fact his country had a \\"touching culture\\" that created problems of interpretation and mandatory reporting laws would face cultural hurdles as well. Luis Antonio Tagle with the icon of St. alt= On June 12, 2012, Tagle was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a five-year renewable term. That same day, Tagle spoke at the 50th International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, Ireland. He discussed how the sexual abuse crisis requires the Church to reevaluate its relationship with the media. He said: \\"As we challenge them to be fair and truthful in whatever they are reporting, the Church should also be prepared to be scrutinised by media, provided the norms of fairness and truthfulness are applied to all, especially the victims.\\" He decried the tendency of Church officials to resent negative media coverage even when accurate, while noting he had witnessed some media coverage in Asia that is tainted by \\"an anti-Christian sentiment.\\" He also mentioned the various issues which distinguish the experience of the Church in Ireland and similar cases in Asia. On August 4, 2012, Tagle delivered a speech at a prayer rally against the Reproductive Health Bill, which included provisions for the funding and distribution of birth control information and devices; contraception is customarily considered abortion in the Philippines. He advocated for the recognition of women's rights by recognizing their valued role as mothers and wives, deserving of genuine love and respect as reflections of God and a gift to mankind. Tagle also denounced sexual prostitution as an affront to women's femininity. He took a more moderate stance on the legislation than other Philippine bishops, refusing to threaten politicians who supported the legislation with excommunication or to have posters criticizing its supporters as \\"Team Death\\" distributed in Manila's parishes. Benedict XVI named Tagle as one of the Synod Fathers for the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelisation on September 18, 2012. In his intervention at that synod, he outlined how he believed the Church should approach the process of evangelization. He said: In an interview with Vatican Radio, he explained how his view reflected the experience of Asian and Philippine culture: His service as archbishop of Manila ended on December 8, 2019 and was the apostolic administrator of the same archdiocese until February 9, 2020, when the cardinal departed for Rome to assume duties in the Roman Curia. The see of Manila currently is in the period of sede vacante. Cardinal Pope Benedict XVI announced he was elevating Archbishop Tagle to the College of Cardinals on October 24, 2012. Tagle himself had been notified the night before. At that consistory, he was assigned the titular church of San Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle. Tagle was the seventh Filipino to be made a cardinal of the Catholic Church.State of the Nation: TV News show with GMA Network senior correspondent: Jessica Soho - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEthidBfn88 When he became a cardinal he was the second youngest one. On November 30, 2012, upon his return to the Philippines, he presided at a thanksgiving Mass at the San Fernando de Dilao Church in Paco, Manila, which President Benigno Aquino III, Vice-President Jejomar Binay, and Mayor Alfredo Lim of Manila attended. Tagle at the Million People March in Rizal Park On January 31, 2013, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Tagle to serve as a member of the Presidential Committee of the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants. Tagle was mentioned by some news organizations as a possible candidate for election as pope during the papal conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013. Tagle led the National Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary at the San Fernando de Dilao Church on June 8, 2013. In a March 2015 interview, Tagle said the Catholic Church needed to develop a new language for addressing homosexuals, unwed mothers, and divorced and remarried Catholics because \\"what constituted in the past an acceptable way of showing mercy\\" changes and needs to be re-imagined. He said: Pope Francis' arrival in Philippines, January 2015 Following the publication of Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si', Cardinal Tagle launched a campaign in the Philippines to collect signatures for a petition against anthropogenic global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. As the Synod on the Family opened public discussion of allowing divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion, Tagle said he was open to hearing arguments on the question. He said: \\"We have a principle we have to believe in. But the openness comes on pastoral judgments you have to make in concrete situations, because no two cases are alike.\\" As the 2014 session of the synod approached he said he hoped that \\"the pastoral care of divorced and civilly remarried couples is debated openly and with good will,\\" but emphasized other challenges drawn from his Philippine experience, especially the separation of married couples from one another and their children caused by poverty and migration. After the synod, he said: In 2015, he said that \\"Every situation for those who are divorced and remarried is quite unique. To have a general rule might be counterproductive in the end. ...We cannot give one formula for all.\\" Tagle with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Malaca√±ang Palace in Manila Cardinal Tagle is a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education, Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, Pontifical Council for the Family, Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People, Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, Pontifical Council for the Laity, and XIII Ordinary Council of the Secretariat General of the Synod of Bishops. On July 11, 2015, he was made a member of the Pontifical Council 'Cor Unum'. He was also confirmed by Pope Francis as President of the Catholic Biblical Federation on March 5, 2015. On May 14, 2015, he was elected President of Caritas International replacing Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga. Some Catholic media that judge Tagle's views to be too liberal criticized the appointment. Tagle has been Chairman for the Episcopal Commission on the Doctrine of Faith of the Philippines since 2003. Tagle is the Professor of Dogmatic Synthesis at the Graduate School of Theology of San Carlos Seminary, the archdiocesan major seminary of Manila, and an Associate Professor of Systematic Theology at the Loyola School of Theology of Ateneo de Manila University. He also taught at the school of theology of the Divine Word Seminary in Tagaytay City. =Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples= Pope Francis named Tagle Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on December 8, 2019. Tagle is the second Asian to head that Congregation, following Cardinal Ivan Dias, who was prefect from 2006 to 2011. He is the second Filipino cardinal to lead a congregation of the Roman Curia after Jose Tomas Sanchez, who headed the Congregation for the Clergy from 1991 to 1996. Pope Francis promoted him to the rank of Cardinal-Bishop, the highest title for a cardinal in the Catholic Church, effective May 1, 2020. He is the first Filipino to be included in the highest rank of the College of Cardinals. On September 10, 2020, Tagle tested positive for COVID-19 upon his arrival in Manila. He was the first head of a Vatican dicastery, as well as the fifth Filipino bishop, to test positive for COVID-19. He had tested negative for the virus in Rome on September 7. He was asymptomatic and was in isolation. On September 23, 2020, it was announced that Tagle had recovered from COVID-19. Coat of arms The top section depicts Christ as the Good Shepherd and as a fisherman, accompanied by an open Gospel Book inscribed with the letters Alpha and Omega. The middle section is a stylized version of Our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of his previous diocese. This consists of an Ionic column surmounted by an ornate \\"M\\" as a symbol for the Virgin Mary, crowned with twelve stars. The bottom depicts a carpenter's square, which signifies Saint Joseph the Worker, along with a lily; these refer to the seminary Tagle attended. Tagle's motto is taken from the John 21:7, Dominus Est (\\"It is the Lord!\\"). Interpretation of Vatican II Tagle served from 1995 to 2001 as one of more than 50 members of the editorial board of the five-volume, 2,500-page History of Vatican II. Completed after discussions at 14 international conferences with contributions from over 100 scholars, it is seen as the seminal work on the Second Vatican Council. It has been criticized by some conservatives for providing an overly progressive reading of the Council. Its principal editors, Alberto Melloni and Giuseppe Alberigo, are identified with the Bologna School of ecclesiastical history which views the Second Vatican Council as a \\"rupture\\" with the past, a position criticized by Pope Benedict XVI and others, who hold that Vatican II represents \\"continuity\\" with the past. Tagle's contribution, written in 1999 when he was not yet a bishop, was a 66-page chapter in the fourth volume of the History called \\"A November Storm: The 'Black Week'\\" which covered the final days of the Council's third session in 1964, when several actions by Pope Paul VI caused alarm among reform forces. Tagle's work has been criticized from opposite viewpoints. In 2005, Archbishop Agostino Marchetto, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants, a \\"continuity\\" advocate, assessed Tagle's chapter as \\"a rich and even comprehensive study\\", but called it \\"unbalanced, journalistic, and lacking objectivity expected of a true historian\\". Hans K√ºng, a principal critic of Pope Paul's conservative impact on the Council, endorsed Tagle's view that the Roman Curia's influence on the Pope forced the Council documents to make \\"theological compromises\\", but said Tagle was unable to develop an explanation or justification for Pope Paul's positions, so that \\"in the closing section his writing degenerates into sanctimoniousness\\". The Vaticanologist John L. Allen, Jr. reported that Cardinal Marc Ouellet, the Holy See's prefect for the Congregation for Bishops and prot√©g√© of Pope Benedict XVI, maintains his \\"full support\\" for Tagle. Allen also reported that a Vatican official indicated that he read Tagle's 1999 essay ‚Äì after media reports highlighted it ‚Äì and found nothing objectionable. In fact, he was impressed by Tagle's defense of Paul VI in that Tagle wrote that Paul followed a strategy of \\"listening to all views, especially opposing ones\\", and was willing to \\"sacrifice his personal popularity to save the council and its future\\". This official also said that it is difficult to suggest Tagle is opposed to Pope Benedict's reading of the council since one of the sources Tagle cited was the writings of Joseph Ratzinger. The Vatican news analyst Sandro Magister reported that Tagle's identification with the Bologna School would have hurt his chances of becoming a bishop had the members of the Congregation for Bishops ‚Äì who considered Tagle's candidacy for archbishop ‚Äì known of it when considering his appointment. In a 2012 interview, Tagle maintained that the Council represented no rupture in the magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church. He added that he does not subscribe to the \\"rupture theory\\" that the Catholic Church before 1962 is disconnected from the present church.

Banks was in 1828 nominated to a cadetship in the Bengal army by the Right Honourable Charles Wynn, at that time president of the board of control. Arriving in India in 1829, he was posted to the 33rd regiment Bengal Native Infantry, of which he became quartermaster and interpreter in 1833. He was subsequently employed for some time on civil duties in the Saugor and Nerbudda territory. In 1842 he served with General Pollock's army of retribution in the march upon Kabul, and shortly afterwards was appointed to a subordinate office in the military secretariat. In this office some years later he was brought into contact with the governor-general, the Marquis of Dalhousie, whose confidence and personal regard he speedily acquired. Owing to the absence of the head of the department on sick leave, it devolved upon Major (then Captain) Banks to make all the arrangements for the expedition which resulted in the conquest and annexation of Pegu. Shortly after the close of the war, he accompanied Lord Dalhousie on a visit to British Burma, and subsequently became a member of the governor-general's personal staff in the capacity of military secretary. In July 1855 he was deputed upon a confidential mission to Lucknow, to communicate to Sir James Outram, the resident, the intentions of the governor- general regarding the annexation of Oudh. When Lord Dalhousie left India, Major Banks joined the Oudh commission as commissioner of Lucknow, and soon became the trusted adviser and friend of the chief commissioner, Sir Henry Lawrence, by whom, on his death-bed, he was nominated to succeed as chief commissioner, but he survived his chief only a few weeks. In Sir John Inglis's memorable despatch on the defence of the Lucknow residency, the death of Major Banks was noticed in the following terms:‚Äî‚ÄòThe garrison had scarcely recovered the shock which it had sustained in the loss of its revered and beloved general, when it had to mourn the death of that able and respected officer, Major Banks, who received a bullet through his head while examining a critical outpost on 21 July, and died without a groan.‚Äô Major Banks was a man of excellent judgement and tact, able and industrious in the discharge of his official duties, a brave soldier, and an excellent linguist.

As a high school student, Cullen played representative netball and basketball, and competed at a national level in athletics. In 2008, she was selected in the New Zealand U21 netball team, and was a member of the side that finished second at the 2009 World Youth Netball Championships, behind Australia. At the end of 2009, Cullen was signed to play with the Northern Mystics in the ANZ Championship, starting from 2010. Cullen played five matches in her debut season, and was nominated for the competition's Best Young Player award. She was selected for the Fastnet Ferns to represent New Zealand at the 2010 World Netball Series in England, where the team finished first. Cullen spent much of her early career playing in almost every position on court, before settling as a defender. In 2011 the Mystics, under new head coach Debbie Fuller, qualified for their first finals series. Cullen played in every Mystics game, and earned a place in the starting lineup for the Mystic's first grand final, which they lost to the Queensland Firebirds. Nevertheless, Cullen's performance during the 2011 season earned her a place in the ANZ Championship All-Star team at wing defence. She also won the award for the ANZ Championship's Best Young Player that year. Early years and career Kayla Malvina Cullen was born on 13 February 1992 in Auckland, New Zealand, into a large, family. She attended Auckland Girls' Grammar School, during which time she competed at national level in athletics, and represented New Zealand in basketball and netball. In 2008, Cullen was selected as a 16-year-old for the New Zealand Secondary Schools (NZSS) netball team and the Junior Tall Ferns basketball team. With her family struggling to raise funds for Cullen to represent New Zealand in two sports, she was donated money to participate in the NZSS netball team's tour of Australia that year. Cullen played as a shooter for most of her early career. 2009: Early U21 career Cullen represented Auckland-Waitakere at national U21 level. She was also selected in the New Zealand U21 squad for their 2008 tour of Australia. She suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament during that tour and underwent rehabilitation surgery. In March the following year, Cullen was reselected for the NZSS netball team. NZSS defeated Australia in the final of a regional secondary schools tournament held in Auckland in June that year. Cullen was named attacking player of the tournament, and overall player of the tournament. Cullen's recovery and NZSS performance led to her being recalled into the New Zealand U21 side for the 2009 World Youth Netball Championships in the Cook Islands, subject to medical clearance following her ACL injury in 2008. Cullen joined the NZ U21 side in the Cook Islands, where they finished second at the World Youth Championships, behind Australia. Her 2009 season was capped off when the 17-year-old Cullen was selected to play for the Northern Mystics in their 2010 ANZ Championship campaign. Joining her in the Auckland franchise was fellow NZSS netball team member Sulu Tone-Fitzpatrick. Cullen's successful year in netball earned her a nomination for the (high school) ASB Auckland Sportswoman of the Year award. 2010: Mystics debut and Fastnet Ferns In 2010, Cullen made her ANZ Championship debut with the Mystics. Normally a shooter, Cullen and fellow NZ U21 player Sulu Tone-Fitzpatrick were called into the Mystics defensive circle during the 2010 preseason to cover injuries to starting players. She played five matches for the Mystics in her debut season: despite being listed in the team roster as an attacking player, she played mostly in the Mystics defensive line. She was nominated as the Best Young Player in the ANZ Championship for 2010, although the award eventually went to Sharni Layton. Cullen retained her spot in the New Zealand U21 team, and was also selected in the Fastnet Ferns to represent New Zealand at the 2010 World Netball Series in Liverpool, England. The 2010 Fastnet Ferns mostly comprised members of the wider Silver Ferns squad, and were much less experienced that the side that won the inaugural competition in 2009. Coach Robyn Broughton opted to use more experienced players for most games, although Cullen was trialled in different court positions, even playing at centre. After struggling through the round-robin matches, the young New Zealand side went on to win the 2010 title, defeating hosts England 28‚Äì26 in the final. 2011: All Star and Best Young Player Despite being played in almost every position during her early career, by 2011 Cullen had become more accustomed to playing as a defender. The Northern Mystics featured a strengthened lineup for their 2011 campaign, adding former Australian representative player Megan Dehn in their attack end, and former Silver Fern Anna Scarlett in the defence circle. The Mystics started their 2011 season well, including an early upset win over 2009 premiers the Melbourne Vixens. Cullen's mobility and athleticism featured in a makeshift defence lineup following injuries to key defenders. Cullen played in all of the Mystics' ANZ Championship games in 2011. The Mystics finished the round-robin season in fourth place, scraping into the finals series. Standout performances against the New South Wales Swifts and Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic earned the Auckland franchise their first ANZ Championship grand final appearance. Despite her young age, Cullen was picked in the Mystics starting lineup at GD for the grand final against the unbeaten Queensland Firebirds, matching up against experienced Australian GA Natalie Medhurst. After a closely fought first half in the grand final, the Firebirds gathered momentum to secure a comfortable 57‚Äì44 victory. Cullen was rested in the third quarter of the match, during which the Mystics defenders struggled to keep up with the Firebirds' attacking pace. After a stellar 2011 season with the Mystics, Cullen was named as the competition's Best Young Player. She was also selected for the inaugural ANZ Championship All-Star Team, slotting in at wing defence; fellow Mystics defender Anna Scarlett was named at goal defence. Following her stellar ANZ Championship season, Cullen joined the New Zealand U21 team in a three-match series against Australia U21, which New Zealand lost 2‚Äì1. The Silver Ferns With injuries to two of the incumbent defenders in the national team, Cullen was named in the ferns for the end of 2011 series against England and Australia. She debuted in the first match against England, and was used in all 5 matches of the year. She was retained in 2012 and has been shifted to the midcourt to cover the retirement of Temepara George and the pregnancy of Joline Henry. Due to the loss of George and Jade Clarke it is expected she will be used in the C position for the Mystics' 2013 campaign. She was named in the Fast5 Ferns for the 2012 Fast5 Netball World Series, where she won a gold medal, used only in the C position. She was also in the 2011 team, where she won a silver medal. In 2015 she was named in the Silver Ferns squad for the Netball World Cup in Sydney, Australia. Cullen played most of the tournament at WD and was in the starting 7 of the Grand Final where New Zealand took home the silver medal behind Australia.

This analysis is part of a company's analysis-system, which also comprises various other analyses, like the industry analysis, the market analysis and the analyses of companies, clients and competitors. This system can be divided into a macro and micro level. Except for the global environmental analysis, all other analyses can be found on the micro level. Though, the global environmental analysis describes the macro environment of a company. A company is influenced by its environment. Many environmental factors, especially economical or social factors, play a big role in a company's decisions, because the analysis and the monitoring of those factors reveal chances and risks for the company's business. This environmental framework also gives information about location issues. A company is thereby able to determine its location sites. Furthermore, many other strategic decisions are based on this analysis. One may also apply the BBW model. In addition, the factors are analyzed to evaluate external business developments. It is finally the task of the management to adapt the firm to its environment or to influence the environment in an adequate way. The latter is mostly the more difficult option. There are different instruments to analyze the company's environment which are going to be explained afterwards. PESTLE analysis One instrument to analyse the company's external environment is the PEST analysis. PEST stands for political, economical, social and technological factors. Two more factors, the legal and environmental factor, are defined within the PESTLE analysis. To explain these environmental factors, it is necessary to say that most of the factors depend on each other and that they change over the years. Consequently, when one factor changes it also affects the others. The equality for every company is the main characteristic of the factors in an environmental analysis. The different environmental factors are covered below. =Political and legal factors= Political and legal factors are here regarded as a unit. They refer to framework given by politics. The exist regulatory or legal frameworks, which can be binding for regions, nations or on an international basis. The frameworks deal with economical issues or issues concerning the labour market. Subsidies, for instance, fall in the category of economical issues. According to the degree of support through subsidies, a country can be more or less attractive for a company. With respect to the labour law of a country, it can highly influence location decisions, too. If e.g. the dismissal protection in a country is very good, a firm may tend to choose a country with a more flexible hire-and-fire-system. Furthermore, the stability of a political system is a real important aspect for most firms. A social market economy with rights for co-determination, regulations for patents, the company's investment and environment protection are main characteristics for a political stable system. =Economical factors= Economical factors deal with national or international economical developments and have a direct influence on supplier and consumer markets. Examples of economical factors that play a big role are: the GDP, the rate of inflation, interests, the change rate, employment or the situation of money markets. These economical factors influence demand, competition intensity, cost pressure and the will to invest. For instance, if the gross domestic product of a country is fairly low, the demand is in general lower than in countries with a higher GDP. =Social factors= Social factors deal with social issues regarding the values, ideas, opinions and the culture of market participants. Market participants can be employees, customers or suppliers. Through their contact with the company, they influence it due to their opinions. The company needs to follow the market participant's change of value and adapt its strategies. Nowadays, a change of values concerning environmental protection is on the move. =Technological environmental factors= Technological environmental factors are meanwhile of a great importance, especially for industrial companies, which underlie a fast technological change. The increasing speed of technological changes, like in microelectronics or robotics indicate risks chances for a company. Particularly producing companies are affected of that fast evolution. =Environmental factors= At last, environmental factors are becoming more and more important nowadays. They regard natural resources and the basis of human life. Among those, the availability of raw materials and energy is the main topic. As the availability of fossil fuels, like oil or coal, gets worse within the next decades, the dependency on those fuels stays pretty risky. Moreover, to show an ecological responsibility, companies should assess and reduce their ecological damage. Through rare raw materials and increasing pollution, an environmentally friendly management gets spotlighted more and more by the public interest. Consequently, eco-friendly products or technologies can even signify a competitive advantage. Methods of the global environmental analysis The segmentation according to the six presented factors of the PESTLE analysis is the starting point of the global environmental analysis. The analysis can be done with the help of a checklist that evaluates every criteria of a segment. In this manner, the status of the global environment shall be defined. In general, every segment needs to be worked on systematically to recognize changes. Then, the factors and its impacts can be interpreted right. After the segmentation, the analysis consists of four further steps: # Environmental Scanning # Environmental Monitoring # Environmental Forecasting # Environmental Assessment =Environmental scanning= The first step is called scanning. Through environmental scanning, every segment is analyzed to find trend indicators. Thus, after having examined the segment, indicators for its development are defined. According to Fahey and Narayanan, scanning reveals ‚Äòactual or imminent change because it explicitly focuses on areas that the organisation may have previously neglected‚Äô. Scanning is also used to detect weak signals in the environment, before these have conflated into a recognizable pattern, which might affect the organization's competitive environment. Scanning can include every material published in the media such as television, newspapers and periodicals. This method of scanning is called media-scanning. Product- scanning includes scanning of products which announce re-emerging consumer behaviour. Looking for global trends on the internet can be defined as online- scanning. Modes of scanning Four modes of scanning can be distinguished. Francis Joseph Aguilar (1967) differentiates between undirected viewing, conditioned viewing, informal search and formal search. *'Undirected viewing' means reading a variety of publications for no specific purpose with the possible exception of exploration. This mode is the most cost-efficient one but it also offers the most benefits. There are a lot of varied sources and information which means that the potential data are unlimited. Data are imprecise and vague and there are no guidelines which determine where the search should be focused. *Applying 'conditioned viewing' the viewer pays attention to the particular kinds of data and assesses their significance for the organization. The field of information is more or less clearly identified. *'Informal searching' can be defined as actively seeking specific information in a relatively unstructured way. *The contrast of informal searching is called 'formal searching'. This proactive mode of scanning contains methodologies for obtaining information for specific purposes. =Environmental monitoring= Environmental scanning is only one component of global environmental analysis. After having identified critical trends and potential events they have to be monitored. The next step in global environmental analysis is called environmental monitoring. It can be defined as 'the process of repetitive observing for defined purposes, of one or more elements or indicators of the environment according to pre-arranged schedules in space and time, and using comparable methodologies for environmental sensing and data collection'. Through environmental monitoring, data about environmental developments are recorded, followed and interpreted. Out of this, historical development changes that are important for the company can be recognized and evaluated. Additionally, the relevance and the reliability of the data sources are tested. Furthermore, it is checked where prognoses are required. =Environmental forecasting= The direction, intensity and speed of environmental trends are explored through environmental forecasting. Especially the search for possible threats is of importance. A prognosis of trends is necessary to get a picture of the future. This is done by adequate methods, like strategic foresight or scenario analysis. Several other methods of forecasting are the following: guessing, rule of thumb, expert judgement, extrapolation, leading indicators, surveys, time-series models and econometric systems. * 'Guessing' and related methods totally rely on luck. Consequently, it is not generally a useful method. In addition, it is almost impossible to evaluate the uncertainty of a guess in advance. * 'Expert judgement' lacks validation being the only component of forecasting. It is hardly to predict which ‚Äòoracle‚Äô is successful. * 'Extrapolation' is effective when tendencies exist. Forecasts are most effective when changes are predicted in tendencies. Prediction in changes in tendencies is likely to miss concerning extrapolative methods. * 'Forecasting based on leading indicators' needs a stable relationship between the variables that lead and the variables that are led. If the reasons for the lead are not clear the indicators may give misleading information. * 'Surveys' of businesses can give information about the future. They rely on planning which needs to be realized. Changes in business implicate changes in planning. * 'Time-series models' are popular forecasting methods. They describe historical patterns of data and they focus on ‚Äúmeasurable uncertainty‚Äù. * 'Econometric systems' of equations are the main tool of economic forecasting. They consist of equations which attempt to ‚Äúmodel‚Äù the behaviour of economic groups such as consumers, producers, workers, investors etc. moderated by historical experience. There are several advantages of using formal econometric systems: Economists are able 'to consolidate existing empirical and theoretical knowledge..., provide a framework for a progressive research strategy..., help to explain their own failures, as well as provide forecasts and policy advice.' =Environmental assessment= In the last step of the global environmental analysis, the results of the previous three steps (Scanning, Monitoring, Forecasting) are assessed. The discovered environmental trends are reviewed to estimate the probability of their occurrence. Furthermore, they need to be analyzed to evaluate whether they represent a chance or a risk for the company. The dimension of the chances or risks is also of importance. Moreover, a reaction strategy to the occurring risks or chances needs to be defined. This is done with the help of the Issue-Impact-Matrix, an adequate instrument to evaluate and prioritize trends. The forecasted environmental factors are here classified with respect to their probability of occurrence and their impact on the company. According to their classification, they demonstrate a high, medium or low priority for the company. The factors with a high occurrence probability and a high, significant impact on the company have the highest priority. The higher the priority, the faster need to be reacted to avoid risks and to benefit from chances. The environmental assessment represents the last step of the global environmental analysis.

Parents  Rudolph Carl Alexander Miethke (14 November 1832 ‚Äì 21 October 1931), sometimes written Carl R. A.

He had two siblings on the boat: Augusta Mathilde Amalie Miethke, and Carl Emil Miethke. He spent a few years on the Victorian goldfields, followed by extensive overseas travel, during which he served from 1861 to 1864 with Abraham Lincoln's 2nd California Infantry Regiment. On his return to Adelaide he joined the South Australian teaching service. In November 1869 he married Emma Caroline \\"Louisa\\" Schultze,Suzanne Edgar and Helen Jones, 'Miethke, Adelaide Laetitia (1881‚Äì1962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miethke-adelaide-laetitia-7571, published first in hardcopy 1986.

He qualified as a teacher, and as was the policy at the time, was in his first years made to serve in a succession of small country schools: Parrot's Hill (near Moculta) in 1867, Reedy Creek in 1868, Mount Rufus then St. Kitts in 1869, moving to Angaston in 1871, Dalkey school (at Sichem) in 1872, Monarto in 1873, Carlsruhe (near Waterloo) in 1876, Chinkford in 1877, Manoora in 1880, Port Victor 1881‚Äì1885, Goolwa 1886‚Äì1891 and Woodville from 1892 until July 1905, when he retired.  History  Adelaide was born at Manoora, South Australia, the sixth daughter of Rudolph and Emma Miethke. She was educated at Victor Harbor, Goolwa, and Woodville public schools, where in each her father was schoolmaster, and from Woodville she went to Hindmarsh as a \\"pupil teacher\\". In 1903 she enrolled with the Teachers' Training College under Andrew Scott. and in 1905 started at Lefevre Peninsula School as a teacher's assistant, Victor John Pavia (c. 1857‚Äì1934) then being head master. She was fortunate in her \\"choice\\" of school, as V. J. Pavia encouraged originality in implementing what she had been taught. She showed such promise that Alfred Williams (c. 1864‚Äì1913), the Director of Education, exempted her from the usual requirement for student teachers to serve two years in outback schools. She concurrently studied art at the School of Design and further advanced studies in English and History, at nights, as spare time and her finances permitted. With the inception of High Schools in 1911, Miethke was transferred to Lefevre Peninsula District High School, became chief assistant, and subsequently senior mistress at Woodville High School. In 1912 the Women Teachers' Progressive League was formed, whose chief aim was to improve women teachers' pay, condition and opportunities; she was to serve as secretary for six years and president for twelve. In 1915 the League achieved prominence when they hosted a conference in Adelaide, at which Lady Galway gave an inspiring speech. Out of the conference came 21 resolutions which were submitted to the Department, most relating to training qualifications, outback work, teaching conditions, system of examinations, and inspection; it took around ten years, but all were eventually realised. In 1915 the League received permission from the Director of Education, M. M. Maughan (1856‚Äì1921), to organise the war efforts of school children, and following a suggestion from Miss S. N. Twiss, raised funds for a soup kitchen at the front. That was the beginning of the Children's Patriotic Fund, organised by Miss Miethke, which raised ¬£250,000. In 1916 she was elected, with J. W. Odgers, a vice-president of the (South Australian) Public School Teachers' Union, the first woman to hold that position, and again in 1918, with J. D. A. Drinkwater. Jubilee 150 Walkway plaque - Adelaide Laetitia Miethke After the War she resumed her night studies and completed her Bachelor of Arts course and was awarded her degree early in 1924. In August 1924 she was sent by the Department to accompany Inspector Mary Kidd MBE, of New South Wales, on a tour of inspection of the Broken Hill schools, and to note the organisation of central and domestic art schools. She was appointed Inspector in November that year, which meant she had to resign from the Women Teachers' Progressive League. The Government inaugurated separate schools for girls in January 1925, and Miethke was appointed to take charge of the central schools system. She then had complete charge of nine new schools for girls, with special attention to the new super-primary branches where technical work had been introduced. The Department sent her to Sydney and Melbourne in 1925 to investigate policies and methods being adopted there. She was elected president of the National Council of Women in 1935, and as such president of the executive committee of the Women's Centenary Council. She had a very high profile during the 1936 Centenary year, speaking on the radio virtually every week and appearing as organiser or guest of honour at a host of rallies, conferences and a dramatic Pageant of Empire which she herself choreographed and organised. This featured 13,600 schoolchildren whom she personally directed, through a megaphone, at the Adelaide Oval. The two performances, on 27 and 28 November 1936, each attracted 40,000 spectators. A book was produced A Book of South Australia ‚Äì Women in the First Hundred Years, largely through the efforts of Phebe Watson (1876‚Äì1964).B. K. Hyams, 'Watson, Phebe Naomi (1876‚Äì1964)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/watson-phebe-naomi-9004/text15851, published first in hardcopy 1990. Retrieved 2 March 2016. More lasting memorials were the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden and the Aerial Medical Base at Alice Springs for the Australian Aerial Medical Services (South Australian section), the \\"Flying Doctor Service\\". In November 1937 the Women's Centenary Council was dissolved, leaving an executive committee of Adelaide Miethke, Phebe Watson, Mrs. D. P. McGuire, Mrs. C. E. Dolling, and Gisela Siebert (with Mrs. E. R. Lawrie as proxy during Miss Siebert's absence) to oversee realisation of these commitments. During the Second World War she was once again to the fore in raising money for the benefit of Australia's soldiers. From 1940 to 1946 she directed the Schools' Patriotic Fund, and served on the Women's War Service Council. She had retired from the Education Department in 1941. SPF funds not spent during the War went into the purchase of a hostel, named Adelaide Miethke House and run by the Y.W.C.A., for use by country girls attending schools in the city. Other unspent SPF money was passed on to the (Royal) Flying Doctor Service and was used to found the \\"School of the Air\\", an idea formulated by Miethke and driven by her. Its base was set up at the Alice Springs Higher Primary School with a team of teachers talking over the Flying Doctor network to, and receiving feedback from, children in isolated locations with their pedal radios or battery-operated transceivers. The service officially started on 20 September 1950.  Other interests  *She was a friend of John Flynn and editor of the RFDS magazine Air Doctor *From 1941 to 1946 she edited the monthly magazine for SA schoolchildren, Children's Hour *She was founding president in 1942 of the Woodville District Child Welfare Association which established four preschools; the Adelaide Miethke Kindergarten (opened 1953) still flourishes. *She was from 1925 to 1939 Commissioner of the Girl Guides' schools division, and member of the State council. *She was involved with YWCA in South Australia *She was a local organiser for the United Nations Appeal for Children *She was an active member of the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Council of Women (as State and national president) *She was an active member of the Adelaide Women's Club and the Catherine Helen Spence Scholarship Committee. *She was an active member of the Ladies Harbour Lights Guild, an adjunct to Missions to Seamen. She died at the family home at 24 Park Street, Woodville.  Recognition  She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1937. The Adelaide Miethke Kindergarten in Woodville was named in her honour. In 1986 a plaque in recognition of her contribution to South Australia was included in the Jubilee 150 Walkway.

A subdwarf O star (sdO) is a type of hot, but low-mass star. O-type subdwarfs are much dimmer than regular O-type main-sequence stars, but with a brightness about 10 to 100 times that of the Sun, and have a mass approximately half that of the Sun. Their temperature ranges from 40,000 to 100,000 K. Ionized helium is prominent in their spectra. Gravity acceleration is expressed by log g between 4.0 and 6.5. Many sdO stars are moving at high velocity through the Milky Way and are found at high galactic latitudes. Structure The structure of a subdwarf O star is believed to be a carbon and oxygen core surrounded by a helium burning shell. The spectrum shows that the content is from 50 to 100% helium. History In the early 1970s Greenstein and Sargent measured temperatures and gravity strengths and were able to plot their correct position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The Palomar-Green survey, Hamburg surveys, Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Supernova Ia Progenitor Survey (ESO-SPY) have documented many of these stars. Occurrence Subdwarf O stars are only a third as common as subdwarf B stars. Spectrum There is actually a variety of spectra from the sdO stars. They can be grouped into those with strong helium lines, termed He-sdO, and those with stronger hydrogen lines, H strong sdO. The He-sdO are fairly rare. Usually nitrogen is enriched and carbon depleted. However, there are variations with enhancement in concentration of even numbered elements such as carbon, oxygen, neon, silicon, magnesium or iron. Examples *HD 128220 was studied by Corrado Bartolini *HIP 52181 pulsates with a frequency of 1.04 milliHertz. *HD 49798 is a carbon poor X-ray binary at 830pc. *US 708 is a hypervelocity star that exceeds the escape velocity of the Milky Way. Life cycle Planetary nebula remains of a dead giant star leaving behind a Subdwarf O star. They can be plotted on the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram. They are from two stages in the stellar lifecycle, post‚Äìasymptotic giant branch (the luminous sdO), and post‚Äìextended horizontal branch compact sdO. The post-AGB stars are expected to be found in planetary nebulas, but only four of the sdO stars are known to be like this. The compact sdOs would be descendants of the B-type subdwarfs. However, statistics do not match sdB. An alternate theory is that sdOs have been formed by coalescing two white dwarfs. This could happen from a close binary that decays due to gravitational waves.

Plichota and Wolf initially tried to publish the series through √âditions Gallimard in 2007, but were rejected. The authors then self-published the series until 2010, when the books were picked up by XO Editions. Of the central character of Oksa Pollock, the authors have stated that they named her after a Ukrainian aunt of Plichota's named Oksana. The series has been published in multiple languages, including Hebrew, French, German, and English. Synopsis The series follows Oksa Pollock, a young girl that has just moved to London with her family. She lives the life of an average thirteen-year-old girl, dreaming of being a ninja while hanging out with her best friend Gus and complaining about her unpleasant and strange maths teacher. Oksa soon discovers that she has supernatural powers as well as a strange new mark on her stomach. Her grandmother Dragomira reveals that this is because she was previously a resident and princess of the land of Edefia and had to flee for her life from the dangerous group known as the Felons. Dragomira was the Gracious (was to be the next Queen and daughter of the older Gracious Malorone), and now Oksa has inherited her powers and is the \\"Last Hope\\". As the series progresses, Oksa must team together with the \\"Runaways\\", a group of Edefians fleeing the Felons, in order to fight against their evil leader Ocious.

The Oxoboxo River, shown on federal maps as Oxoboxo Brook, is a tributary of the Thames River in New London County, Connecticut. It flows roughly in a southeasterly direction from its source at Oxoboxo Lake to its confluence with the Thames. It has a watershed of , 87% of which is in the town of Montville.Town of Montville Plan of Conservation and Development 2010 , May 15, 2010 The Oxoboxo was an important source of water power during English colonial settlement and 19th-century industrial development in Montville. The first sawmill on the river was established in 1653. As of the 1880s, the river supplied power for 15 cotton, woolen, and paper mills. The river's source, Oxoboxo Lake, is a natural lake whose size and elevation have been increased by damming. The earliest dam at Oxoboxo lake was constructed in the 17th century; it has been rebuilt and increased in height several times since, reaching its current elevation in the 1880s. The name was derived from Native American terms for the river and lake. Other historical names for the stream and alternative spellings of \\"Oxoboxo\\" include Abscubogset, Absubogsuck, Cochikuack Brook, Cokichiwake, Cokikuak, Cuchickuwock, Okeshoksee, Okseboksce, Oxopaugsuck, Oxyboxy, and Sawmill Brook.

He is the brother of the journalist Damien McCrystal and the son of the journalist and writer Cal McCrystal.

Comedy/Theatre director After training under European clown-theatre gurus Pierre Byland and Philippe Gaulier, McCrystal moved into theatre directing. His first show was Let The Donkey Go with the innovative theatre company Peepolykus. It became the surprise hit of the 1996 Edinburgh Fringe festival and led to two more shows with Peepolykus, I Am A Coffee and the Chekhov spoof Horses For Courses. Described as \\"Britain's funniest director\\",Brian Logan, \\"Theatre Blog\\", The Guardian, 8 June 2011 McCrystal's shows are known for their chaotic physical comedy elements and irreverence. After Peepolykus, McCrystal went on to direct stage productions for the Cambridge Footlights, including their 1998 show Between A Rock And A Hard Place which starred Richard Ayoade and John Oliver, and The Mighty Boosh. Some of his most acclaimed work came with the internationally successful clown troupe Spymonkey. After directing the clown sequences for Cirque Du Soleil's touring show Varekai, McCrystal returned in an expanded role on the company's Las Vegas-based erotic cabaret Zumanity, incorporating Spymonkey as the show's comedy act. In 2003, McCrystal directed an acclaimed production of Joe Orton's Loot at the Derby Playhouse. He returned to the Playhouse two further times for productions of Kafka's Dick and The Killing of Sister George, the latter starring British comedian Jenny Eclair and Carla Mendon√ßa. In 2011, McCrystal was invited by Nicholas Hytner to work alongside him as Associate Director on the National Theatre's production of Richard Bean's One Man, Two Guvnors, a reworking of Carlo Goldoni's 18th century Commedia dell‚Äôarte play The Servant Of Two Masters.

After a series of stories exposing government corruption, her life was threatened and her paper firebombed. In 2002, she was awarded a CPJ International Press Freedom Award.  Early life  Petrushova was born near Nizhny Novgorod in 1965. She is the daughter of Albert Petrushov, a reporter for the Russian Communist Party newspaper Pravda. Petrushov was known for his expos√©s of government corruption in Kazakhstan, including a story which ended the career of Kazakh Politburo member Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev. In the early 1980s, Petrushova joined a journalism program at St. Petersburg State University that would allow her to work with her father. She later stated that traveling the country with him and seeing the impact that media attention could have on life in remote villages \\"made me positive that this is the thing I should do with my life.\\" Petrushova married a psychologist in 1984. The couple have two sons. In 1992, Petrushova's father suffered serious brain damage when he was struck, apparently deliberately, by a car. His manuscript for a book on Kunayev was stolen while he was unconscious.  Respublika  Founded in 2000, Petrushova's weekly Respublika focused on covering business and economic issues in Kazakhstan, and frequently published stories highly critical of president Nursultan Nazarbayev's regime. The paper wrote about financial scandals and rampant nepotism and cronyism. Scandals exposed the paper included the granting of oil rights to one of Nazarbayev's relatives; the disappearance of funds for an airport in the capital, Almaty; and the Kazakh police forcing tourists off a plane so that Nazarbayev's daughter might fly alone. Respublika's most notable story was an expos√© which revealed that Nazarbayev had stashed US$1 billion of the state's oil revenues in a Swiss bank account; the government stated that this had been an emergency fund used to rescue the national economy in 1998. In November 2001, a government representative unsuccessfully attempted to buy a controlling stake in Respublika. In January 2002, Kazakhstani printers began to refuse to print the paper, one after a human skull was placed on his doorstep. Respublika was also ordered by a Kazakhstani court to stop printing, but evaded the ban by printing under titles like Not That Respublika. Petrushova bought a digital copier so that Respublika could do its own printing, but then the paper's offices became the target of intimidation and threats. On International Women's Day, a funeral wreath was mailed to Petrushova. On another occasion, a decapitated dog was hung from Respublika building with a screwdriver sticking into its side and a note reading \\"there will be no next time\\"; the dog's head was left outside Petrushova's home. Three days after the dog incident, the papers' offices were firebombed and burned to the ground. In July, Petrushova was given an eighteen-month jail sentence on tax charges, but served no time after a judge ruled that the case fell under an amnesty. Petrushova eventually left the country for Russia, where she continued to publish via the Internet, living apart from her family for their safety. In recognition of her work, Petrushova was awarded a 2002 International Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists, a US-based NGO.  In Russia  In Moscow, Petrushova edited the Assandi Times, a publication which has reported extensively on the United States Department of Justice investigation into allegations that president Nazarbayev and his allies had accepted US$78 million in bribes from American oil companies in 2000. In April 2005 Petrushova was briefly detained in Volokolamsk near Moscow in Russia at the request of Kazakh authorities who sought her detention on charges of tax evasion and breaking Kazakh citizenship laws. After Moscow prosecutors ruled that the statute of limitations had expired on the charges, Kazakhstan's request for her extradition was denied. Petrushova was released a few days later. She had also been detained on the same charges in St. Petersburg in 2004.

There is only one truly wild subspecies extant in the world today, the Przewalski's horse of Mongolia. A feral horse is a free-roaming, untamed horse that is descended from domesticated ancestors. All horses that were once native to North America died out between 13,000 and 9,000 years ago.

Some argue that the term \\"feral horse\\" denies the horse's prehistoric existence in North America and human beings' role in exterminating it from the continent, while others say that the term \\"wild horse\\" denies that the modern horse was introduced by Europeans.

It was not the first refuge established solely for the protection of wild horses, as the range also served the armed forces. About a quarter of the refuge lies within the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.\\"Wild Horses.\\" Billings Field Office. Bureau of Land Management. United States Department of the Interior.

Establishing the range Bureau of Land Management map of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range, showing BLM, Crow Nation, Forest Service, National Park Service, private, and state lands In 1900, there were two to five million feral horses in the United States.Evans, p. 134. However, their numbers were in steep decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources.Lynghaug, p. 104. After the mid-1930s, their numbers fell even more drastically due to intervention by the U.S. government. The United States Forest Service and the U.S. Grazing Service (the predecessor to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)) began to remove feral horses from federal land. The two agencies were concerned that there were too many horses on the land, which led to overgrazing and significant soil erosion. Ranchers wanted the feral horses removed because they were grazing on land ranchers wanted to use for their own livestock. Hunters were worried that as horses degraded range land, hunting species would also suffer. It was not clear that there were too many horses, or that the land was incurring damage due to the presence of the horses. Nonetheless, both agencies responded to political pressure to act, and they began to remove hundreds of thousands of feral horses from federal property. From 1934 to 1963, the Grazing Service (and from 1946 onward, the BLM) paid private contractors to kill mustangs and permitted their carcasses to be used for pet food.\\"The Fight to Save Wild Horses.\\" Time. July 12, 1971. Accessed 2011-05-23. Ranchers were often permitted to round up any horses they wanted, and the Forest Service shot any remaining animals. Feral horse advocates were unhappy with the Forest Service and BLM's horse-culling procedures. They argued that herding horses from the air or by motorized vehicle (such as motorcycles) terrorized the animals and caused numerous and cruel injuries. Led by Velma Bronn Johnston‚Äîbetter known as \\"Wild Horse Annie,\\" a secretary at an insurance firm in Reno, Nevada‚Äîanimal welfare and horse advocates lobbied for passage of a federal law to prevent this kind of hunting. Their efforts were successful. On September 8, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act (Public Law 86- 234, also known as the \\"Wild Horse Annie Act\\"), which banned the hunting of feral horses on federal land from aircraft or motorized vehicles.\\"Eisenhower Signs Bill Protecting Wild Horses.\\" New York Times. September 9, 1959. However, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy ordered the United States Department of the Interior to implement measures to stop soil erosion on federal land.Cruise and Griffiths, p. 188. On the Pryor Mountains range, where there were about 140 to 200 horses, BLM ordered in 1964 that the horses be removed.Crutchfield, p. 98. Fearful that the horses were not going to be stabled but that the roundup was a prelude to slaughter of the entire herd, in 1966 Johnston began a letter-writing and public relations campaign against the BLM.\\"U.S. Studies Fate of Wild Horse Herd Roaming Montana.\\" New York Times. April 7, 1968.Cruise and Griffiths, p. 188-192. Johnston's goal was the establishment of a permanent refuge for the Pryor Mountains herd,Cruise and Griffiths, p. 192. but this was a daunting task. Hunting and ranching lobby groups had strongly opposed establishment of a feral horse refuge in Nevada, and accepted creation of the Nevada Wild Horse Range in 1962 only because it was within the Nellis Air Force Range area of (renamed Nevada Test and Training Range in 2001).Ryden, p. 269. In 1965, Johnston founded the International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros (ISPMB), a nonprofit group dedicated to educating the public about the plight of feral horses and burros, and lobbied Congress and the executive branch for their protection on public land.Silverstein, Silverstein, and Nunn, p. 37. Johnston and her group had several local allies as well. They included Bessie Tillett (a widowed rancher's wife in her 80s) and her sons, Royce and Lloyd Tillett. The Tilletts tried to protect the feral horses beginning in 1964, claiming them as their own and threatening BLM officials who tried to remove the herd from land which the Tilletts leased from BLM.Neil, p. 69. (The Tilletts also kept feral horses from the herd on their private land, and began adopting them out.)Lynghaug, p. 104-105. BLM officials suspended the Tilletts' lease in 1966 (the reason was inadequate fencing), forcing the family to give up their claim to many horses. Others who wanted to protect the herd included ranchers and the people of nearby Lovell, Wyoming, who not only considered the horses as part of Western heritage but also as a major tourist attraction. The ISPMB and its allies proved highly effective in raising public awareness of the issue and building political support for their efforts, and in 1966 BLM suspended its plans for the roundup. In 1968, BLM proposed three new plans for dealing with the Pryor Mountains Mustang herd: removing but not killing all but 30 to 35 animals and allowing the rest to remain on the range; killing all but 10 to 15 animals and allowing the herd to recover to 30 animals; or allowing the state of Montana to remove all the animals and sell them. In response, Pryor Mountains horse advocates began pushing for a protected sanctuary for these animals. The group contacted ABC News producer Hope Ryden and made her aware of BLM's plans. Ryden visited the range and filmed a news segment which aired on July 11, 1968, on ABC News with Frank Reynolds.Ryden, p. 251.Unti, p. 214; Cruise and Griffiths, p. 211. ABC News and BLM were \\"deluged\\" with mail protesting the removal of the horses after the segment aired. On August 27, 1968, the Humane Society of the United States successfully sued to stop trapping of the horses.Ryden, p. 255-256. The political landscape shifted dramatically toward protection rather than removal of the horses. On September 9, 1968, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall formally established a Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range of . Montana's senior senator, Mike Mansfield, was so elated that he published Udall's order scrapping the BLM plan in the Congressional Record.Crutchfield, p. 99. The size of the range was determined by law, which specified that the range could cover only those areas where feral horses existed in 1971 (but not necessarily historically). A boundary fence had been constructed between BLM and Forest Service land in the 1940s, which significantly affected feral horse distribution in the Pryor Mountains and restricted the horses to rangeland south, east, and west of the Custer National Forest.Billings Field Office, p. 92. Accessed 2011-06-07. By 1968, when the refuge was created, fences completely surrounded what became the refuge, limiting the horses' spread. Both BLM and the Forest Service interpreted the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 as requiring protection of feral horses only on those lands where the horses existed as of 1971, not lands which they had historically used.Billings Field Office, p. 96. Accessed 2011-06-07. Changing legal status of the range Establishment of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range did not end debate over the legal status of the horse herd, how they should be protected, or how many horses should be permitted to live on the range. In October 1968, the Interior department established an Advisory Committee to report on the state of the herd, the status of forage on the range, and whether feral horses should continue to be kept on the range.Ryden, p. 261. The panel met a month later, and commissioned studies on whether branded runaway horses should be allowed to mix with the herd, whether BLM should build artificial watering holes to encourage the animals to range more widely, whether BLM should manage the herd's bloodlines by introducing stallions to the herds, and how many horses should live on the range.\\"Panel Studies Montana-Wyoming Wild Horse Herd.\\" New York Times. December 26, 1968. At its February 1969 meeting, the committee proved sharply divided over horse management issues.\\"Montana Weighing Wild Horses' Fate.\\" New York Times. March 30, 1969. Studies of the range proved highly inadequate. BLM presented a study to the committee which attempted to show that horses were grazing the land so heavily that extensive erosion was taking place, but a private study found that the erosion was due to topography and drought and not because of the horses.Cruise and Griffiths, p. 194. Another study, conducted by a group which promoted hunting on the range, found that the horses were having a negative impact on edible plants in the Pryor Mountains and were having a detrimental impact on deer fawn survival. But the committee discovered that this study had not been conducted in the Pryor Mountains but at another location.Ryden, p. 259. Another BLM study concluded that the Pryor Mountains horses had changed from grazers to browsers and were consuming large mountain mahogany shrub, a critical deer food source.Antelope eat forbs such as sagebrush, and deer eat twigs from shrubs, brush, and trees. Horses, like elk and cattle, are grazers and prefer grass. See: Mautz, p. 321-348. But an Advisory Committee analysis showed that the plants documented in the study were small mountain mahogany shrub variety, not the large mahogany shrub as claimed by BLM, and that the vegetation was in good shape, not deteriorated as the BLM claimed. In June 1969, the Committee rendered its unanimous opinion that forage on the range was in good shape, herd health was good, and that the range should be managed solely for the protection of wild horses. The Advisory Committee did, however, recommend that the herd levels be reduced to no more than 100 horses; that branded, deformed, old, and sick animals be culled from the herd; that BLM should create new watering holes to encourage the herd to forage more widely; that the range be fenced; and that roads be constructed in the range's interior to improve access for tourists.\\"U.S. Urged to Help Wild Horse Herd.\\" New York Times. June 21, 1969. In 1970, BLM built a catch-basin to help supply horses on the range with water.Pospisil, Allan. \\"Where the Wild Mustangs Play.\\" New York Times. May 2, 1971. =Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971= A feral horse grazes on the Pryor Mountains refuge. Also at issue were BLM practices for managing horses in protected areas. Under BLM policy, ranchers could release a branded mare into a herd and then, the following year, round up the band the mare ran with for slaughter or sale.Ripley, Anthony. \\"A Devoted Few Strive to Save Wild Horses.\\" New York Times. November 15, 1970. In Nevada, state law permitted ranchers to round up any unbranded horses on their private land and slaughter or sell them. Concerned about these practices, and about continuing horse hunts in unprotected areas, Johnston and her group began working to pass federal legislation to protect feral horses throughout the U.S. She was joined by a number of prominent people, including country music singer Judy Lynn, Gunsmoke actress Amanda Blake, and New Hampshire Union Leader publisher and conservative William Loeb III.Ripley, Anthony. \\"Woman Has Worked for 20 Years to Save America's Vanishing Wild Horse.\\" New York Times. November 12, 1971. On December 18, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon signed into law the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA), which made it a crime for anyone to harass or kill feral horses or burros on federal land, required the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals, required studies of the animals' habits and habitats, and permitted public land to be set aside for their use.Naughton, James M. \\"President Signs Bill to Protect Wild Horses on Federal Lands.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1971.Government Accountability Office, p. 13. Accessed 2011-06-07. In addition, the act required that feral horses be protected as \\"living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West\\", and that management plans must \\"maintain a thriving natural ecological balance among wild horse populations, wildlife, livestock, and vegetation and to protect the range from the deterioration associated with overpopulation.\\"Iraola, p. 1056.The act was challenged in court for being unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the act in all regards in United States v. Johnson, 685 F.2d 337 (9th Cir. 1982). See: Iraola, p. 1072. Although feral horse ranges were principally for the protection of the horses, the land was required to be maintained for multiple use. BLM was also permitted to close public land to livestock grazing to protect feral horse and burro habitat. The WFRHBA gave jurisdiction over challenges to BLM and Forest Service management of feral horses and how the act is implemented to the Department of the Interior's Board of Land Appeals.Iraola, p. 1051. The act also contained provisions for the removal of excess animals; the destruction of lame, old, or sick animals; the private placement or adoption of excess animals; and even the destruction of healthy animals if range management required it.Iraola, p. 1053-1054.Sterba, James P. \\"Revived Killing of Wild Horses for Pet Food Is Feared.\\" New York Times. August 3, 1974. The destruction of healthy or unhealthy horses almost never occurred. The WFRHBA left range management policy unresolved in many respects, although it did specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies.Iraola, p. 1052. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting).Pitt, p. 515-516. In November 1971, BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountains herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation stunted on the range. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountains range had increased by 17 percent over the 1968 level.Pitt, p. 518. However, there was strong disagreement over whether the population had increased as much as this, if at all. =Adopt-a-Horse program= In 1973, BLM began a pilot project on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range known as the Adopt-A- Horse initiative.Pitt, p. 528. The program took advantage of provisions in the WFRHBA to allow private \\"qualified\\" individuals to \\"adopt\\" as many horses as they wanted if they could show that they could provide adequate care for the animals.Glover, p. 1111-1112. At the time, title to the horses remained permanently with the U.S. federal government. The pilot project was so successful that BLM allowed it to go nationwide in 1976. (As of 2001, the Adopt-a-Horse program was the primary method of removing excess feral horses from BLM and Forest Service land.) In 1976, Congress included a provision in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that permitted the humane use of helicopters in capturing free-roaming horses on federal land, and for the use of motorized vehicles in transporting them to corrals. In 2009, a BLM official said that while many federally protected feral horse ranges have trouble gaining adoption for their horses, every horse from the Pryor Mountains herd put up for adoption was subsequently adopted by a private citizen. A mare attends to her foal on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge. There were, however, strong disagreements over the nature of the horses. Many ranchers and hunters considered feral horses to be an invasive species, or at least an introduced species. While conceding that federal law protects the animals, these individuals also argued that economic needs (like livestock grazing) should take precedence over the horses. However, horse advocates argued that horses were native to North America and eliminated by paleolithic human beings, and as a native wild animal, they should be protected as are the grizzly bear or bald eagle. To test which definition applied to feral horses, in 1974 the New Mexico Livestock Board seized 19 free-roaming feral burros that were preventing cattle from using a watering hole on federal land.Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976) at 534. The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico held that, under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress could regulate wild animals only to protect public land from damage.Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 534‚Äì535. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that these free-roaming horses and burros were, in fact, wildlife, and it rejected New Mexico's narrow construction of the Property Clause.Flores, p. 121. Ranchers continued to litigate the issue, however. In the early 1980s, ranching interests won a ruling from the Department of the Interior that feral horses who ate grass or drank water on lands which ranchers had leased had \\"taken\\" these resources from the ranchers in violation of the \\"takings clause\\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, in Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1423 (1986), cert. den'd. 480 U.S. 951 (1987), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit said that a wild animal was not an \\"agent\\" of the federal government and hence could not be found guilty of \\"taking\\" the ranchers' leased grass or water.Iraola, p. 1064. Problems with the Adopt-a- Horse program also emerged. BLM was accused of allowing too many adoptions so as to deplete feral horse populations on federal land. Many private individuals were also accused of \\"adopting\\" horses only to sell them later for slaughter as pet food. Responding to these problems, in 1978 Congress passed the Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA). The PRIA limited adoptions to four horses a year per individual and allowed BLM to relinquish title to the horse after one year (during which inspections regarding the animal's treatment were to occur).Pitt, p. 521-522. The law also required BLM to inventory all feral horse herds, scientifically determine what constituted \\"appropriate\\" herd levels, and determine through a public process whether \\"excess\\" animals should be removed. Congress further amended PRIA in 1978 to require updated herd counts.Glover, p. 1110-1111. Pursuant to the 1978 amendments, BLM established 209 \\"herd management areas\\" (HMAs) where feral horses existed on federal land.BLM initially ignored whether the Adopt-a-Horse program continued to permit private individuals to adopt horses with the intent to sell or slaughter them. In March 1987, the Animal Protection Institute sued the Department of the Interior, arguing that BLM was turning a blind eye to the intent to slaughter. In Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 671 F. Supp. 695 (1987), the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held that BLM could not ignore the intent of adopters. The decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 860 F.2d 920 (1988). In 1997, the Animal Protection Institute and BLM signed an out-of-court settlement under which BLM would require individuals to sign an affidavit stating they had no intent to sell the animal for slaughter or for use as rodeo stock. The settlement also required BLM to establish rules requiring horse slaughterhouses to maintain paperwork on horses for no less than one year and to report any horses to which clear title was not established. BLM also agreed to no longer permit adoption by proxy or power of attorney. However, the district court refused to enforce this settlement in 2000, leaving the issue unresolved. See: Glover, p. 1113, 1115‚Äì116. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range was one of only three HMAs solely dedicated to feral horses. In January 1982, the director of BLM issued a moratorium on the destruction of excess adoptable animals.Government Accountability Office, p. 3. Accessed 2011-06-07. From 1988 to 2004, Congress also prohibited BLM from using any funds to destroy excess animals.Government Accountability Office, p. 59. Accessed 2011-06-07.

The act directed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the United States Department of the Interior to inventory and study all federally owned roadless areas for possible designation as a Wilderness Area. Until the United States Congress makes a final determination on the status of a wilderness study area, the BLM must manage the area as a protected national wilderness.

In 2004, Republican Senator from Montana Conrad Burns inserted a rider into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 (a 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill) which permitted BLM to sell excess animals more than 10 years old or which have been offered for adoption three times.Iraola, p. 1054.Nack, William. \\"'They Have to Be Free'.\\" ESPN.com.

Although the legislation (signed into law by President George W. Bush) was described by one media outlet as \\"undercut[ing] more than three decades of lobbying and legislative action aimed at protecting America's wild horses from slaughter\\", as of May 2011 it has not been repealed.

However, BLM procedures do not ban the export of wild horses for sale and slaughter outside the United States. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office concluded BLM was not in compliance with the 2004 amendment. BLM had imposed limitations on the sale of excess horses to help ensure that they were not slaughtered (thus avoiding a public outcry). About the range =Geographic and ecological description= The Pryor Mountains are a region of Montana and Wyoming.Cruise and Griffiths, p. 185. They were formed in the late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary period (about 70 to 60 million years ago)Hodges and Feldman, p. 203. when magma welling up from below cracked a vast limestone plateau into four pieces and uplifted the northeast corner of each piece.Gordon and Krumm, p. 2.McRae and Jewell, p. 317. The Bighorn River flows north from Wyoming until it reaches the plateau between the Bighorn and Pryor mountains. The river flows along the fault line between the two mountain ranges, and has cut the Bighorn Canyon deep into the limestone. The Crow Native American tribe called the mountains Baahpuuo Isawaxaawuua (\\"Hitting the Rock Mountains\\"), because of the large amount of flint found there (a type of rock which could be chipped into arrowheads and spear points).Massingham, p. 10. The mountains were named after Sergeant Nathaniel Hale Pryor, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who vainly pursued horses stolen from the expedition in the area.Dutson, p. 209.Clawson and Shandera, p. 40-41. Soil and water resources on the range are limited. Soil depth varies from less than deep to deep, and there are only five perennial water sources on the range.Billings Field Office, p. 60. Accessed 2011-06-07. Livestock grazing occurred on the range until the late 1960s, and the area historically was severely overgrazed. This created the limited forage conditions found on the range today. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range is east of and adjacent to Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. The range consists primarily of alpine meadows, high desert, rocky ridges, and steep, semi-alpine slopes.Massingham, p. 9. The average elevation is about . Rainfall varies from as little as in the foothills to in the mountains' upper reaches.Massingham, p. 13.Rowles, p. 98. Snowfall is generally about a year, and occurs from September to May. =About the herd= Historians and scientists speculate that feral horses have lived on and near Pryor Mountains since at least the late 1600s.Singer and Schoenecker, p. 39. Crow Indian tradition maintains that the horses were brought to the area by about 1725.Pomeranz, p. 15. Non-Indian explorers found native people owning large numbers of horses as early as 1743.Massingham, p. 15. Thousands of feral horses lived in the area by the time American pioneers began settling near the Pryor Mountains in the late 1800s. Stallions fight for control of a band, or \\"harem,\\" of mares on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range. A single stallion can control a band of about six to eight mares. It was widely believed that the Pryor Mountains horses were direct descendants of the Barb horses brought to North America by Juan de O√±ate's expedition in the early 1600s to explore America north of the Rio Grande. Their bloodlines may also include American Saddlebred, Canadian, Irish Hobby, and Tennessee Walking horses, although this was in dispute for many years. Some people claimed that the horses were nothing more than local domestic horses that had escaped to the wild. In 1992, equine geneticist Dr. E. Gus Cothran ran genetic studies on the herd, and concluded that their primary bloodline descends from Spanish Barbs. Since no genetic variants were observed that were not also seen in domestic horse breeds, in 2010 Cothran concluded the horses were not a unique species that had survived from prehistoric times.Cothran, p. 3. Accessed 2011-06-07. Rather, they were linear descendants of the Spanish Barb, with some evidence of genetic similarity to light racing and riding breeds.Cothran, p. 4. Accessed 2011-06-07. The genetic tests also revealed that the Pryor Mountains horses carried a rare allele variant known as \\"Qac\\" that only Spanish horses brought to the Americas also carried.Billings Field Office, p. 8. Accessed 2011-06-07. Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg of the Virginia‚ÄìMaryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, and an expert on horse breeds, observed that, physically, the horses conform to the Colonial Spanish Horse type. Genetic studies have also revealed that the herd exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity. BLM has acknowledged the genetic uniqueness of the herd. The Pryor Mountains feral horse conforms to a very specific type. The animal is generally high, with an average of . The horses weigh on the range, and more if raised in captivity. The animals exhibit a wide range of solid colors, including bay, black, chestnut, dun, grullo, and blue or red roan. Buckskin coloring is rare but does occur, and pinto coloring can be minimally expressed. However, the majority of colors are dun or grullo.Lynghaug, p. 106. Nearly all the horses on the range exhibit primitive markings, such as dorsal stripes, transverse stripes across the withers, and horizontal \\"zebra\\" stripes on the back of the forelegs. The Pryor Mountains horse's body is heavy, with strong bones. Manes and tails tend to be long, and the horse's winter coat is very heavy and often curly. The head is convex or straight (the \\"Roman nose\\" identified by horse breeders), with wide-set eyes, hooked ears, and a broad forehead that tapers well to the muzzle. The front teeth meet evenly, the upper lip is usually longer than the lower, and the nostrils are small and crescent shaped. The neck is medium in length, and most of the animals have only five lumbar vertebrae (an anatomical feature common in primitive horses)‚Äîalthough some have a fifth and sixth vertebrae that are fused. The horse's shoulders are long and sloping, the withers are prominent, and chests are medium to narrow in width. The croup is generally sloped, and tail-set is low. The hooves are ample and very hard. Pryor Mountains Mustangs exhibit a natural paso gait. The horses are generally intelligent, strong, and sure- footed, and exhibit great stamina. Like all feral horses, they generally avoid human contact, are distrustful, and are easily spooked. However, once they are familiar with an individual, they can exhibit a strong social bond with that individual. Pryor Mountains horses can be trained and ridden, and trained to do any task a domesticated horse can perform. Trained Pryor Mountains horses have a calm temperament, and are alert on trails. The horses form bands or \\"harems,\\" in which a single stallion mates with and controls a group of about six mares. Another eight to 10 \\"bachelor\\" stallions accompany the band at a distance, hoping to win control of it from the stallion or to mate with mares. =Herd management= BLM counts the herd visually about every four years by flying over the range, reporting on each animal found, and using statistical methods to correct for historic undercounting and other problems.Government Accountability Office, p. 2.

In 1984, BLM set the maximum carrying capacity of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range at 121 adult animals, and revised this to 95 adult animals in 1992.Government Accountability Office, p. 71. Accessed 2011-06-07. Management of the Pryor Mountains horse herd has focused on fulfilling the Free-Roaming Wild Horse and Burro Act's requirement that BLM maintain a \\"thriving natural ecological balance\\". In general, BLM initially focused on how many horses the range could support and in maintaining conformity to the Pryor Mountains standard. However, with the development of DNA testing in the mid-1980s, the focus changed to maintaining the herd's genetic viability as well. In 1988, researchers at Washington State University published a paper that raised concern that the herd exhibited a lack of genetic diversity, and could be suffering from genetic drift and/or a population bottleneck.See, generally: Kirkpatrick and Gilluly, 1988. Accessed 2011-06-07. BLM contracted with veterinarian E. Gus Cothran (then at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Kentucky, but now at the Texas A&M; College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences) to take random genetic samples of the herd in 1994, 1997, and 2001. Cothran's analysis found \\"no evidence of a bottleneck\\".Cothran, p. 5. Accessed 2011-06-07. Genetic diversity was above the mean for feral horse herds in the United States, and just below the mean for domesticated breeds. The BLM, however, interpreted these studies in 2009 to indicate that the genetic diversity of the Pryor Mountains herd is \\"well above\\" the mean for domestic breeds.Billings Field Office, p. 18. Accessed 2011-06-07. Cothran considered the herd to be in genetic equilibrium, although he cautioned that a minimum of 120 breeding-age animals should be kept on the range to maintain the genetic health of the herd. Research by biologists and veterinarians at Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky, and other colleges found that there is little inbreeding in bands, as the stallions tend to drive off colts when they are about two years old. In 1990, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highly critical of BLM's wild horse management programs. The GAO concluded that the BLM had little scientific basis for deciding what the range-carrying capacity was or how many horses should be removed to attain ecological equilibrium or restoration.Government Accountability Office, p. 5. Accessed 2011-06-07. Furthermore, the GAO found that the BLM had not reduced livestock grazing or engaged in range management activities to improve the carrying capacity of the land. For years, BLM had also allowed any horse to be adopted from the range. Since adopters favored \\"pretty\\" horses, the genetics of the herd altered so that mostly bays and blacks were left on the range.Lynghaug, p. 105. This problem was quickly discovered. Adoption procedures changed in 1994 so that now the original colors and patterns of the herd are returning. That same year, the Pryor Mountains Mustang Breeders Association was formed to preserve the gene pool of the herd and establish a registry for Pryor Mountains horses in private hands. In order to be placed on the register, the horse must have a registered sire and dam, have a title issued either by BLM or the Tillett ranch, and have a certificate of blood typing from the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky. As of 2008, 209 horses in 16 U.S. states and one Canadian province were on the registry. BLM undertook a roundup of the horse herd in 1997 to reduce its numbers, and BLM officials said that they expected to do another in late 2000 when the herd size reached 200. By August 1999, there were 180 adult horses and colts on the range. A \\"guzzler\\" (precipitation trap and storage tanks designed to provide water to wildlife) on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge In May 2009, after several long-term studies of the rangeland, BLM determined that the range's maximum carrying capacity was 179 feral horses.Billings Field Office, p. 11. Accessed 2011-06-07. This assumed that all BLM land, as well as lands leased from other owners (public and private), would continue to be available to the animals, and that BLM would be able to manage the horses by using artificial watering sites to encourage the horses to use undergrazed portions of the range. BLM also said it would implement other range management techniques, including restoration of riparian vegetation to enhance existing watering holes, use of controlled burns to reduce the amount of dead wood and brush on the range,The concern was that large amounts of dead wood and brush could cause a fire so severe it would extensively damage the forage on the range. Erosion from soil left bare from the fire would also significantly degrade water sources. As of 2009, BLM and the Forest Service both had bans on controlled burns in the Custer National Forest and the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range. In May 2009, both agencies proposed a separate analysis to build a record that would support lifting the burn ban and allow implementation of prescribed, controlled burns to improve the range. See: Billings Field Office, p. 104. Accessed 2011-06-07. noxious weed control, better fencing, and other methods.Billings Field Office, p. 20. Accessed 2011-06-07. BLM also proposed purchasing of land from the state of Montana, and another of private land, to add to the range. At the same time, BLM said it would reduce the herd from its existing 195 adults to 120. The goal was to temporarily remove feral horses from the refuge to allow the range to recover from the historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range.Billings Field Office, p. 103. Accessed 2011-06-07. According to Jared Bybee, BLM wild horse and burro specialist, grass cover on the range was at 18 percent of its historic average.French, Brett. \\"Wild Horse Range Pressured By Overgrazing.\\" Billings Gazette. July 12, 2009. Accessed 2011-06-07. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those that did not closely fit the conformity type; that were genetically well represented; that were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age.Billings Field Office, p. 27. Accessed 2011-06-07. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's conformity to type (using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg), and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court.\\"Wild Horse Roundup in Pryor Mountains to Begin.\\" Associated Press. September 3, 2009. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed. BLM began its roundup of feral horses on the Pryor Mountains range in early September 2009. After several days, 130 of 188 feral horses were rounded up.French, Brett. \\"Wild Horse Roundup Nears End.\\" Billings Gazette. September 9, 2009. Accessed 2011-06-07. Forty-six horses were put up for adoption, while the freed mares were given a contraceptive vaccine to help keep the herd population down. The Forest Service also closed a portion of the Custer National Forest to livestock grazing after about 40 feral horses moved into the area, but rounded these up as well and returned them to the range. At this time, BLM also placed \\"guzzlers\\" on the range. A guzzler is a precipitation (usually rainwater) collection device that traps water in a storage tank (ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons/liters). The storage tank can be above-ground, partially buried, or below-ground. A mechanical valve releases water into a drinking trough from the storage tanks, allowing animals access to the water. When the valve senses that the water level in the trough is low, it opens and allows more water into the drinking area.For general information on guzzlers, see: Mitchell, Dean; Larsen, Randy; and Raymer, Danny. \\"What the Heck Is A Guzzler?\\" Wildlife Review. August 2006. Accessed 2011-06-08. Five guzzlers were placed in undergrazed areas to encourage the horses to better use this forage. In the fall of 2010, BLM issued a set of draft strategy documents for operating its wild horse programs, and solicited public comment on the plans.Whitcomb, Rachel. \\"BLM Eyes Greater Cooperation With HSUS on Wild-Horse Gather.\\" DVM Newsmagazine. September 1, 2011. Accessed 2011-09-26. After receiving numerous comments, BLM said in February 2011 it would quicken the pace at which it revised its roundup procedures, use of fertility control drugs, and wild horse and burro range land management. The agency also commissioned a study from the National Academies of Science (NAS) on wild-horse management. Due for release in 2013, independent NAS experts will study a wide variety of issues, including the carrying capacity of wild horse and burro ranges, wild horse and burro population growth, and best practices in fertility control. In September 2011, BLM announced it would begin working with the Humane Society of the United States to develop new practices in herd management and roundup, and increase its emphasis on adoptions and the use of drugs as fertility control to help better manage its wild horse herds. =Sightseeing on the range= The Pryor Mountains feral horse herd is one of the most accessible feral horse herds in the United States. Tourism to the range increased steadily in the mid to late 2000s.Billings Field Office, p. 67. Accessed 2011-06-07. Panoramic image of the Pryor Mountains in Montana The range can be easily accessed via a paved road which parallels Bighorn Canyon, and which provides excellent viewing of the horses.\\"Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range.\\" Montana Office of Tourism. No date. Accessed 2011-06-07. The range can also be accessed from Laurel, Montana, by traveling south on U.S. Route 310 and taking the Forest Service gravel road to Dryhead Overlook. Those with four-wheel drive vehicles can take the rutted dirt road through the forest to Penn's Cabin, which is another good horse viewing spot. Those interested in circumnavigating the range can take the dirt Burnt Timber Ridge Road from Penn's Cabin to the dirt Sykes Ridge Road, and follow Sykes Ridge Road to its terminus. (Sykes Ridge Road also offers the best viewing of the Bighorn Basin.) Roads around the range tend to be impassable in wet weather or snow. Some of the range may be accessed via the Crow Indian Reservation. A trespass permit (obtainable from the Crow Nation) is required to cross tribal land or exit a vehicle while on tribal land.Fischer and Fischer, p. 74. Hiking on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse range is good, but there are no maintained or marked trails and (as of 2000) no guidebooks to the area.Kesselheim, Alan. \\"Running With the Herd.\\" Backpacker. May 2000, p. 93. In addition to feral horses, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge is a good place to see other wildlife and plant species. Among the species found there are Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, black bears, blue grouse, cougars, elk, gray wolves, mule deer, ring-necked pheasant, and sage grouse.Billings Field Office, p. 80. Accessed 2011-06-07. The Pryor Mountains are also home to the most diverse bat populations in Montana, with 10 species identified (and potentially other species also present). The range is also home to several animals which BLM or the state of Montana considers sensitive to ecological change, such as Baird's sparrow, long-eared myotis (a species of vesper bat), pallid bat, peregrine falcon, spotted bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout.Billings Field Office, p. 82. Accessed 2011-06-07. There are 15 species of plants on the range which have been granted special status by the state of Montana or the federal government.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It stands in High Street, opposite the site of Burton in Lonsdale Castle. History The church was built between 1868 and 1876, and designed by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. People note that it was seems a large church for what is a small town, but this is because it was thought the railway would come to the village and its population would expand. The first vicar of the church was Revd Frederick Binyon, father of the poet Lawrence Binyon. Architecture All Saints is constructed in sandstone, with a slate roof. The porch is in wood, with a tiled roof. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, a north aisle, a north porch, a chancel, a north vestry, and a tower occupying the position of a south transept. The tower is in three stages with buttresses. On its west side are single-light lancet windows in the bottom and middle stages. The top stage contains lancet bell openings. Around the top of the tower are corbel tables, and the tower is surmounted by a broach spire. There are two- and three-light windows in the nave, and a four-light window in the vestry. The chancel has two-light lancet windows on the north and south sides. The east window has three stepped lights, with smaller windows above. Inside the church, the arcade between the nave and aisle has a glass screen which was inserted in about 1970. In the chancel are a piscina and a double sedilia.

He belonged to the Dada movement, and in 1919 became a founding member of the artist circle called Stupid, together with Heinrich Hoerle, Angelika Hoerle (1899‚Äì1923), who was the sister of Willy Fick and the wife of Heinrich Hoerle, Anton R√§derscheidt, his wife Marta Hegemann, and Franz Wilhelm Seiwert. Fick was a Cologne dadaist from 1916 until 1923 and a scholarship student of Jan Thorn-Prikker at the Cologne School of Applied Arts /K√∂lner Werkschulen from 1928 until 1931. Duesseldorf art agent Johanna Ey represented his Weimar period works. Many works were destroyed by bombing in World War II but preserved in archival photographs in the Rheinisches Bildarchiv / Rhineland Picture Archive. Fick painted and cartooned until his death in Canada in 1967. Early life Wilhelm Peter Hubert Fick was the third child of cabinet maker Richard Fick of Massow, Pomerania, and Anna Kraft of Cologne, Germany. He was born in Cologne February 7, 1893. Willy's mother was the daughter of a highly placed Cologne railroad official, a loading master. While apprenticed as a cabinet maker, Willy took evening and weekend courses at the K√∂lner Werkschulen / Cologne School of Applied Arts, where he met artists Heinrich Hoerle and Anton R√§derscheidt, who later along with him co-founded the art-political group, Stupid. Fascinated by art, music and architecture, Willy subscribed to the black-and-white periodical Licht und Schatten, collected sheet music and went to the impressive 1912 exhibition titled Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Kunstler. Willy Fick's father was a staunch trade unionist, his young sister Angelika a budding socialist, and Willy dabbled with the anarchistic works of Mikhail Bakunin. The Fick music evenings where Willy played piano or violin with his siblings, often turned into heated political discussions. Dadaist Anti-war proponents such as Willy, his sister Angelika and his future brother-in-law Heinrich Hoerle felt confident the S.P.D. Social Democratic Party of Germany would not vote for war credits in 1914, but when it did, Willy Fick registered as a conscientious objector. He served in a non- combat position as a wagon driver from 1917 to 1918. He had time until 1917 to develop his art which started with anti-war linocuts mocking the sheepishness of the masses. Willy's acquaintanceship circle enlarged during the war to include Otto Freundlich and Carl Oskar Jatho, both of whom had returned early from the front. From 1916 onwards Carl and K√§the Jatho ran an artist-centered anti-war group in their home where Willy met their friend Franz Wilhelm Seiwert, an artist and arts theorist with a broad circle of friends. Everyone was connected either through art, politics, war or love. Willy got into closer contact with the married artists Marta Hegemann and Anton R√§derscheidt who were friends of the Hoerles. However unlike those noted, Willy Fick had full- time employment. He worked for the City of Cologne Transportation Department between 1918 and 1923 during a time when cash-strapped Germany fomented with revolt. Since Willy squeezed his art time out from work and because he was a natural buffoon, Fick became the butt of sarcastic humour during the Dada time. He appeared in the Bulletin D exhibition as an \\"Unknown Master from the Beginning of the 20th Century\\"http://www.dada-companion.com/who-is-who.php and in the Brauhaus Winter exhibition as \\"a vulgar dilettante\\". In a taped interview with Prof. Michel Sanouillet in 1967 he explained his part in these exhibition/events that mocked the established art world. He also stated that his work traveled with the Bulletin D exhibition to the Graphic Cabinet Von Bergh and Co in D√ºsseldorf in 1920. Fick's first works under his own name appeared in Stupid 1, the catalogue of the continuous exhibitions at the R√§derscheidt apartment on Hildeboldplatz. His childlike works were in keeping with the Stupid group's intention to create a newer, better world after the Armageddon of World War I. Fairy-tale like watercolours from this period show the hope for a better world that was soon dashed by the dire post-World War I situation and by the death of his sister Angelika Hoerle who died of tuberculosis at 23 years of age. Weimar artist Deaths haunted Willy Fick during the inter-war period. His sister Angelika died 1923, his mother in 1927, his brother Richard in 1932, his father in 1935 and his sister Maria in 1939.Teuber, Dirk \\"Willy Fick: A Cologne Artist of the 20s\\", Cologne: Wienand Verlag, 1986 Deaths and the success of the Nazi party in 1933 dominated the negative iconography Fick developed. His dark works in which human simulacra float in a void and where life is played on or by a checkered board, were influenced by Surrealism, Neue Sachlichkeit and the Cologne Progressives. Although it was a personally sad and politically oppressive time, Fick's career prospered. He was a member of the Werkbund bildender K√ºnstler/Association of Progressive Artists, exhibited at the K√∂lnisher Kunstverein/Cologne Art Institute, Becker and Newmann Gallery and with Johanna Ey, known as Mother Ey in D√ºsseldorf. Gottfried Brockmann who had been a friend of Fick's sister Angelika wrote, \\"Sometimes I saw pictures by him at Mrs. Ey's; they were small but very colourful. I still remember one of them clearly. It was a hot-house with steel blue and poisonous green flowers.\\" In 1927, Richard Riemerschmidt, director of the K√∂lner Werkschulen championed Fick so that he received a tuition-free scholarship thanks to Mayor of Cologne Konrad Adenauer. From 1928 until 1931 he studied full-time under the tutelage of Jan Thorn-Prikker, a famous glass painter and muralist. Thorn-Prikker's most significant impact on Fick's art was his lifelong interest in transparency and his love of colour experiments that looked like stained glass. In 1932 the constellation of the short-lived \\"Gruppe 32\\" comprising glass painter Ludwig Egidius Ronig, Neue Sachlichkeit artist Heinrich Maria Davringhausen, and Fick's dada-time friends Seiwert, R√§derscheidt and Hoerle, showed the mixture of Neue Sachlichkeit, glass painting and Progressive interests that blended at that time and in Fick's works as well. \\"Gruppe 32\\" had two exhibitions in Cologne and D√ºsseldorf before disbanding in 1933. In preparation for Fick's first solo show \\"Works by Willy Fick\\" at the City Art Museum, D√ºsseldorf, in March to April 1931, he had his works photographed by the Rheinisches Bildarchiv/Rhineland Picture Archive. The photo of \\"Morceau\\" shows Fick was also experimenting with sand mixed in his paints. Like Franz Wilhelm Seiwert, Fick was interested in the facture that distinguished art from photography. 1931 was Fick's banner year. Picture of a Boy was reproduced in Der Querschnitt, Berlin and The Concert Nr. 1 in Cahiers d'art, Paris. Once the Nazis came into power Fick pulled back his art activities to escape notice as a former socialist and dada artist. He took the art work he'd salvaged from his sister Angelika Hoerle's apartment and hid it in the garden shed of his atelier in Vogelsang, an outskirt of Cologne. The artists represented in his cache, Max Ernst, Hoerle and Seiwert, had already been labelled degenerate artists and it was dangerous to possess their works. Fick's opposition to Fascism was expressed in his paintings of the 1930s. An example is Speaker, in which a man whose gesture resembles a distorted Nazi salute is observed by empty human silhouettes and masks. On the table in front of him is a sheet of paper inscribed with the letters ABDH, a reference to the factory code of the Heinkel He 111, a bomber which began production in 1935 in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Fick continued to work for the City of Cologne but ceased exhibiting. Thanks to the photos of the Rheinisches Bildarchiv / Rhineland Picture Archive, Fick's strongest works survive as black and white images. According to Fick's post-war claim for restitution, 40‚Äì45 oil paintings and over 70 watercolours and drawings were destroyed in the last years of the war, by the bombing of Cologne on October 31, 1944, and by the March 1945 looting of recently released foreign labourers. A Dadaist in Whitby In 1945 Fick started designing hospitals and public buildings for the High Rise Division of the City of Cologne. In recognition for his success as an artist, he was given one day off per week to pursue his art. He did not actively pursue exhibition but he did show works at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in 1959‚Äì60, at the Museum Kunstpalast /Duesseldorf Museum in 1960 and occasionally in the Aloys Faust Gallery. When his only living relative, his nephew Frank Eggert, moved to Whitby, Ontario, Fick began the first of six three-month visits; these took place between 1954 and 1967. Fick painted during his time in Whitby, applying the eyes of his European art experiences to the Canadian landscape Fick created a unique European-Canadian fusion. When he retired from the City of Cologne in 1956 Fick travelled extensively, during which time he regaled his Canadian family with illustrated letters. The letters demonstrate Fick's lifelong love of cartooning. By the mid-1960s Fick's emphysema slowed down art and travel. He managed to execute black marker sketches of scenes in Whitby and two days before his death he was installed by Professor Michel Sanouillet as an honorary member of the International Dada and Surrealism Association in recognition of his contributions to dada in Cologne. Willy Fick was buried in Whitby on October 5, 1967.https://curatorbyday.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/willy-in-whitby/ Legacy When Willy Fick paid the back rent on his deceased sister Angelika Hoerle's apartment on Bachemerstrasse in Lindenthal in 1923 he saved her works and those left behind by Max Ernst, Franz Wilhelm Seiwert and Heinrich Hoerle. When he hid nearly 300 items, he saved a time capsule of the dada time period from Nazi destruction.Littlefield, A. \\"The Dada Period in Cologne: Selections from the Fick-Eggert Collection\\", Toronto: Art Gallery of Ontario, 1988 Thanks to the family of his nephew Frank Eggert (Dr. Frank-Michael Eggert, Angelika Littlefield and spouses), the Fick-Eggert Collection at the AGO in Toronto acts as a permanent art historical resource. Additionally, supporting documentation for the Fick-Eggert Collection is available through the Rheinisches Archiv Kunstlernachl√§sse in Bonn, Germany.http://www.rak- bonn.de/text/bestaende.htm When Willy Fick had his 1928‚Äì1931 works photographed by the Rheinisches Bildarchiv / Rhineland Picture Archive, he left a record of works that show the blend of styles in Cologne during the Weimar period prior to and during Nazi persecution. These photographic records inspired The Art of Dissent: Willy Fick in 2008 showing that even persecution and war cannot destroy the messages Fick's works hold for future generations.

Rishi coffins are funerary coffins adorned with a feather design, which were used in Ancient Egypt. They are typical of the Egyptian Second Intermediate Period, circa 1650 to 1550 BC. The name comes from ÿ±Ÿäÿ¥ÿ© (risha), Arabic for \\"feather\\". During the Egyptian Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom, coffins were rectangular. The first coffins in anthropoid (human) shape only appear in the 12th Dynasty. These designs copied mummies showing a human head and the body without arms and legs as if they are wrapped in linen. The coffins were always in several sets with the outer coffin being rectangular. Perhaps already in the 13th Dynasty, these anthropoid coffins were decorated all over with a feather design and are no longer placed within an outer, rectangular coffin. These are the first rishi coffins. The earliest example mentioned in literature is the coffin of the scribe of the great enclosure Neferhotep, dating to the 13th Dynasty.Gianluca Miniaci, Stephen Quirke: Mariette at Dra Abu el-Naga and the tomb of Neferhotep: a mid-13th dynasty coffin (?), In: Egitto e Vicino Oriente, 31 (2008), 1-25 However, this coffin was only described by the excavator and is now lost. The earliest secure known examples of rishi coffins belong to the kings of the 17th Dynasty, and were found in the 19th century at Thebes (Luxor). The depicted person most often wears a nemes headdress, the body is covered with feathers, there is an inscription in the middle going from the top to the bottom and on the chest are shown a vulture and a cobra, both royal symbols. From the 17th Dynasty are also known many private rishi coffins. This type of coffin is still attested in the early New Kingdom, but is later replaced by other coffin types.

L. Jensen (8 March 1800 ‚Äì 26 March 1856), was a Danish artist who specialized in flower painting.\\"J. L. Jensen\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 9 June 2011. Early life and education In parallel with his studies at the Danish Academy, he became a pupil of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and also of Cladius Detlev Fritzsch. Specializing in flower painting, Jensen continued his education in Paris under the Flemish flower painting brothers, G√©rard and Cornelis van Spaendonck, and at the porcelain factory in S√®vres where he learnt the art of miniature flower painting. Career Taking 17th-century Dutch flower painting as a starting point, he revived the art in Denmark. His floral arrangements often had both a decorative and symbolic value. Danish plants were often accompanied by exotic flowers and fruits, sometimes even birds. He also became head artist at the Danish Porcelain Factory. Jensen had an extensive circle of customers and many students, especially women, including Louise of Hesse-Kassel who later married King Christian IX. Since the 1980s, his works have gained wide international recognition. Many are exhibited in Statens Museum for Kunst and in Thorvaldsens Museum. Style Vase of Dahlias Jensen's flowers were typically arranged as a bouquet standing in a vase, usually on a tray. A dark neutral background helped to emphasize the light colourful tones of the flowers. Roses were often the principal subject, sometimes set off with another flower such as a lilly or with several flowers of different varieties. Jensen mastered the art of reproducing nature. His appreciation of earlier masterpieces can be seen in his own work. His paintings characteristically are rich in colour and variety. Some of them depict flowers lying on a table or in a basket, perhaps strung together in a wreath. While he was one of several artists who painted exotic plants from Rosenborg, he was happiest when he was painting out in the country at Gentofte, sometimes painting wild flowers or strawberries. Some of his works from the 1840s contain exotic fruits or even birds.Elisabeth Fabritius, \\"J. L. Jensen\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilsbachs kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 9 June 2011.

It has a catchment area of 620 square kilometres and opens north- westward into the Baie d'Harcourt, flowing towards the northern point of the island along the western escarpment of the Mont Pani√©. The village of Ou√©goa lies on the river, not far from the mouth. The Diahot flows into the sea between the villages of Bwalayet and Pam, just south of Ile de Pam. It carries a substantial load of fine-grained sediment, which has increased over time due to felling and burning of forest and woodland vegetation and the introduction of grazing, creating soil erosion in the river system.  Hydrology  = General characteristics = Diahot has been monitored during a 43-year period between 1955 and 2008. The mouth is very influenced by tide so discharge is measured at Bond√© Sainte Anne. At this place the basin area is 248 km¬≤. Average discharge at this place is 4 m¬≥.s‚àí1. Because of daily flows variability and strong influence of flood events on average values, this quantity is very representative of what is commonly observed in streams. We, therefore, prefer the term median flow to characterize the normal flow of watercourses. Median daily flow characterizes the flow value exceeded on average one day on two. Its value on Diahot is 2,3 m¬≥.s‚àí1. Diahot has seasonal flow variations strongly marked with floods during the wet season (December‚ÄìApril) and a large peak of 11 m¬≥.s‚àí1 in March. Low water occur during the dry season (July to November) in summer (July to September), resulting in a decrease in average monthly flow to 1.1 m¬≥.s‚àí1 in September. Diahot watershed receives an average annual water blade precipitated of 1097mm while the runoff depth is 796mm. The interannual mean runoff coefficient is 50%. = Extreme Values = The annual flood discharge rises to 500 m¬≥.s‚àí1 and 10-year flood to 1906 m¬≥.s‚àí1. The hundred-year flood is between 3375 m¬≥.s‚àí1 and 5400 m¬≥.s‚àí1 according to the assessments of flood maxima observed. The maximum flood was observed during the tropical depression on February 6, 1972. Its flow was then measured at 3720 m¬≥.s‚àí1. The small size of Caledonian watershed gives them a very important responsiveness to hazards. Concentration time that reflects duration between the maximum rain episode with the corresponding maximum throughput is only 4:25 for Diahot.

The genus is known solely from Early to Middle Cambrian fossils found in North America, Greenland, Europe, North Africa, Asia, and Australia.The Paleobiology Database Pojetaia entry accessed 4 January 2012 The genus currently contains two accepted species, Pojetaia runnegari, the type species, and Pojetaia sarhroensis, though up to seven species have been proposed. The genera Buluniella, Jellia, and Oryzoconcha are all considered synonyms of Pojetaia. Description Pojetaia are small bivalves with valves that are subequal in size and suboval in shape. In size Pojetaia specimens reach a total shell length of less than and a height of . The shells are compressed laterally and the back edge is slightly broadened. The rear adductor is more developed and larger than the front adductor, with the pallial muscles arranged in partially connected series along the valve margins. The ligament is usually straight with an umbo which is central to subcentral and each valve possessing between one and two teeth, with a total of no more than three teeth on a specimen. The exterior of the shells shows faint ribbing and fine comarginal growth lines. The inner shell layers of Fordilla and Pojetaia species both consist of layers of carbonate which is akin to the laminar aragonite layer found in extant monoplacophora. The structuring is similar to shell layering found in the extinct genera Anabarella and Watsonella, which is thought to suggest that members of the phylum Mollusca developed nacre independently several times. Due to the size and age of the fossil specimens, Pojetaia are included as part of the Turkish Small shelly fauna.  Affinity Pojetaia and Fordilla appear to form a clade, but whether this is in the stem or crown group of Bivalvia is unconstrained by the available evidence. Species =P. runnegari= The type species for Pojetaia, P. runnegari was first described by the Australian paleontologist Peter A. Jell in 1980. The description was based on fossils found in early Cambrian Parara Limestone sediments exposed in South Australia. The species has since been found in Cambrian strata of Greenland, Germany, Transbaikalia, Turkey, Northern China, and Mongolia. Fossils tentatively placed in Fordilla from the Browns Pond Formation of New York and Anse Maranda Formation of Quebec have been tentatively reassigned to Pojetaia runnegari. The species P. ostseensis was described in 1995 from two partial fossils found on the island of Bornholm. In his description of the species, Hinz- Schallreuter suggested the presence of three teeth on the left valve and the slightly larger size of the valves as reason for the erection of the new species. Other researchers, such as Elicki, have noted these differences fall into the accepted range of variation for P. runnegari and as such consider P. ostseensis as a synonym rather than valid. The genus Oryzoconcha, with the single species O. prisca, was described in 1985 by He and Pei from fossils found in Henan province, China. Further study by researches has resulted in genus and species being rejected, and the fossils assigned to P. runnegari. Similarly the genus Jellia and its two species J. elliptica and J. ovata, described by Li and Zhou in 1986, are also considered synonyms of P. runnegari as they fall into the rage of variation described for the species. The cryptic genus Buluniella and species B. borealis was described in 1986 by V. Jermak from three fossils found in Northern Siberia. The two right and one left disarticulated valves known show a slightly convexity of the hinge, central umbo and lack of a row of muscle scars were used to the genus from Fordilla. The less distinct umbones were suggested as reason to separate Buluniella from Pojetaia. Due to the high variation in characters of Cambrian bivalve species the validity of Buluniella as a separate genus and species has been questioned several times. In 1992 Bruce Runnegar and Pojeta recommended Buluniella belonged to Fordilla and suggested the species be treated as Fordilla borealis. Further examination of the fossils has resulted in both the genus and the species being currently treated as a synonym of P. runnegari. =P. sarhroensis= P. sarhroensis was named by Geyer and Streng in 1998 and is now known from a series of 49 fossils from early middle Cambrian sediments exposed in the Anti-Atlas mountains of Morocco. In the type description the major differences between P. sarhroensis and P. runnegari were noted to be fairly minor. The most distinct features of P. sarhroensis include occasional specimens with up to four teeth, a larger auricle angle, and a posterior tooth which is larger than that in P. runnegari. Other fossils It has been suggested at times that the problematic species Watsonella? terranovica may belong to Pojetaia as Pojetaia? terranovica. Reexamination of the species in 1991 by Landing resulted in the conclusion that the species may be a rostroconch from Watsonella or it may be a bivalve. Thus the positioning of the species is currently Watsonella? terranovica but with doubt.

The history of rail transport in Madagascar began at the start of the twentieth century, with the construction of a metre gauge line between Brickaville (now Ampasimanolotra) and Madagascar's capital, Tananarive (now Antananarivo). That line was the first section of the Tananarive‚ÄìC√¥te Est railway (TCE) from Tananarive to Toamasina, the country's chief seaport. It eventually became the nucleus of a network of three railways, the Network North (). Between 1926 and 1936, an isolated line, the Fianarantsoa-C√¥te Est railway (FCE), was built, again in metre gauge, in the south east of the island. The FCE is also known as Network South (French: R√©seau Sud). The two separate networks were combined under the same management in 1944. The whole system was nationalized in 1974. By the 1990s, the national system was very run down, and the Malagasy government decided to privatize it. Since 2003, Network North has been run by a joint stock company, Madarail, under a 25-year concession, while Network South has remained under parastatal operation. Madagascar has also had a number of industrial railways, including a line serving a sugar cane plantation on the small island of Nosy Be, north west of the main island.

It is a valve used for sampling. The sampling valve allows the operator to extract a sample of the product from the production line or reactor and safely store it for transportation to the laboratory where it will be analysed or to the archive room where it can be retrieved for further use. In chemical plants, a sample can be taken during the process to ensure that the output meets specifications (or that the quality is acceptable), before shipping the chemical good or before accepting the chemical product.  Sampling problem  When sampling chemical products, it is of utmost importance to select representative material to analyse. The sample must be representative of the lot, and the choice of samples is critical to producing a valid analysis. The statistics of the sampling process are also important.The University of Adelaide, Department of Chemistry ‚Äô‚ÄôSampling‚Äô‚Äô And in order for a sample to be representative, it must not contain remains of previous batches that might have stay in the valve's \\"dead space\\". For example, a ball valve commonly found in tap valves consists of a ball that control the flow of the liquid. Once the valve is closed, liquid stays in the ball and the next time the valve is opened, that liquid flows first. If a sample is taken using a ball valve, the valve has to be flushed before the sample is taken. This raises two additional problems: # If the liquid is a chemical substance that solidifies at room temperature such as polymer or other plastics, it can block the valve and prevent a second sample to be taken. # The residue of the chemical substance that was flushed needs to be recycled or destroyed at a cost both for the chemical plant and the environment. When sampling hazardous chemicals or deadly substances, it is extremely important that the operator is not exposed to toxic fumes or vapours. These can fatally harm people and should they be released in the atmosphere, they will pollute the environment.  Choosing a sample valve  When choosing a sampling valve, different factors have to be considered: * The material, pressure and temperature rating, gaskets, size and position of the valve according to the pipe specification of the plant. * The handle or actuator type according to the position (reach) of the valve and depending of the chemical to sample (i.e. if the product contains solid particle or not) * The receptacle to store the sample for transportation (bottles, container, bag, piston injector or syringe)  See also  * Other type of valves * Sampling  References  Category:Valves ","title":"Sampling valve"},{"id":"32030132","text":"Watsonella is a genus of 'mollusc' known from early (Terreneuvian) Cambrian strata.

USPS 499-920 Design and development The PF-1 was initially constructed by Posnansky in Switzerland in 1963, while he was a student at ETH Zurich there. The aircraft resembles the FFA Diamant, which was also under construction at the same time and place. Posnansky flew the aircraft for one year and then later moved to San Diego, California. The aircraft was inactive until 1983. Posnansky and Fronius greatly modified the PF-1 and re-licensed it as a US Experimental - Amateur- built, N15PF, in 1983. The PF-1 is of mixed construction. The fuselage is a glass and foam sandwich, while the wings are from a Schleicher Ka 8 and thus have spruce spars covered in birch plywood and doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing employs a NACA 64-415 airfoil and has terminal velocity dive brakes on the top and bottom surfaces. The tow hook is mounted on the aircraft's center of gravity. The landing gear is a fixed and faired monowheel. The cockpit features a reclined pilot position and a side-stick. Even though it uses the same wing as the Ka 8 the White Knight has a glide ratio that is seven points higher, due to the more streamlined fuselage. Only one PF-1 was ever built.

The Oregonian, p. 16. It became unused in 1965 and was put up for sale, but remained unsold for an extended period, and its demolition was planned. In 1967, the non-profit group Old Church was formed with the intent of preserving the building. After a one-year fundraising campaign the group purchased the building from Metropolitan Baptist Church on April 1, 1969, for $95,000. At its next meeting, Old Church Inc. changed its name to the Old Church Society. Initial efforts to save and preserve the building were led by Lannie Hurst, an actress and performer. The Oregon Journal chose Hurst as one of 10 \\"Women of Accomplishment\\" in 1969, explaining that \\"Few fundraising campaigns of any sort ever captured the imagination and support of Portlanders as completely as did the drive to save The Old Church...\\" The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, under its original name of Calvary Presbyterian Church. The Old Church is a non-profit that focuses on restoring and preserving the structure and providing artistic and cultural programming. Restoration work has included major interior and exterior overhauls that have aimed to preserve the historic character of the building while adding modern conveniences to keep the space relevant and useful. During the restoration, Jerry Bosco and Ben Milligan, prominent collectors of historic artifacts, donated the original porte-coch√®re to The Old Church. Most recently The Old Church installed a new stage, bar, and marquee and state-of- the-art sound and lighting systems. Since 1969, The Old Church has hosted free weekly lunch-time concerts on Wednesdays and it hosts concerts by touring and local artists. The space is also used for weddings and other events.

The sewer systems were overwhelmed by the deluge and the city was paralyzed by the flooded roads. Autoroute 15, a sunken highway also known as the Decarie Expressway, soon filled with water, trapping motorists. Some 350,000 houses lost electricity, and tens of thousands had flooded basements. Two people died, one in a submerged car and another who was electrocuted.  Meteorological situation  A heat wave had been affecting the province of Quebec, Canada, for over a week. Temperatures in the air mass were reaching and the dew points were around , both exceptionally high for Southern Quebec. During the evening of July 13, a northeast to southwest cold front approached the Montreal region from Ontario and triggered isolated severe thunderstorms. = Initial analysis = Weather map showing the meteorological features responsible for triggering the severe outbreak on the morning of July 14, 1987 The map on the left shows the meteorological situation at 1200 UTC of the morning of July 14, 1987 (0800 local). The cold front at the border between Ontario and Quebec is supported by an intensifying barometric trough at 500 mb, and a low pressure is developing at the surface, just southwest of Ottawa, Ontario. Cumulonimbus with high tops were easily forming in the moist, humid and unstable air mass near the ground while drier air was cooling the air in the mid-tropospheric levels. A wind divergence at the upper level and a convergence near the surface, due to the low pressure, was helping to organize the deep convection. Evaluation of the nearby upper air station tephigram showed a very strong convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the hodograph had a strong wind shear in the first above ground, conducive to rotation in the convective clouds, hail, heavy rain downpours, and downbursts. There was a thick layer of clouds northwest of Montreal, near the frontal zone, but only a thin layer of low clouds further southeast. The analysis of the upper air data led to the prediction of a maximum temperature again above and dew points of . = Development = Weather radar echoes between 1620 and 1830 UTC: 1) Hatch lines are contours of 19 dBZ, and black areas are echoes of 47 dBZ or more. 2) There a series of four thunderstorms named A, B, C, and D passing over the region. 3) The Island of Montreal is at the center of the loop. The surface low deepened as the day progressed and moved very slowly. Rising temperatures and breaking of the low clouds meant that cumulonimbus developed along the clouds‚Äô edge when the dry air at the upper level reached extreme southwestern Quebec. The Montreal-Dorval weather station showed the following conditions at 11 a.m.: temperature of , relative humidity of 73%, wind speed of 9 km/h, and weather conditions hazy. By noon, conditions deteriorated quickly to thunderstorms and heavy rain showers. The weather radar loop on the right shows that a series of four thunderstorms, noted A to D, crossed the Island of Montreal from Valleyfield to Sorel. These affected roughly the same area from 1620 UTC (12:20 pm local) to 1830 UTC (2:30 pm local). The intensities on the 1.5 km height CAPPI are over 47 dBZ which represents rain rates of per hour or more. Three times, these intensities reached above , indicating the possibility of severe downbursts and hail. Some trees were uprooted and large hail reported locally but it is the amount of rain left by the thunderstorms that marked the event.  Impact  Heavy rain affected all of the Island of Montreal. There was recorded at Montreal Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport on the West end and at Rivi√®re-des-Prairies on the East end. However the highest amounts were recorded around the Mont-Royal and downtown areas. The largest official amount has been at Parc Lafontaine but a non official total of was recorded by a City of Montreal station in the downtown core. The city of Laval that occupies √éle J√©sus just to the north, received a large amount of rain too, up to . However, the region just across the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal was spared the worst as only is recorded at Saint-Hubert airport and in Laprairie according to Environment Canada. Montreal's sewer system was designed to handle only per hour, which is a once-in-10-years occurrence, according to Gaston Moreau, assistant director of public works. The flood's return period was estimated to be at least 50 years. Lightning and wind caused widespread power outages which in turn stopped the pumping system from evacuating the excess water from low lying roads and underpasses. D√©carie expressway, a sunken highway, rapidly filled with water descending from access roads and soon became a river. Thousands of motorists were trapped and had to be rescued by firefighters and truckers with higher-clearance vehicles. An 80-year-old man drowned and another person died of electrocution. Nearly households lost electrical power, to houses and businesses were flooded causing an estimated C$220 million in damages (not adjusted for inflation). Traffic was paralyzed for hours as most streets and roads had flooded areas. Montreal Metro, buses and suburban train service were stopped. The basement of an elderly care hospital in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood was flooded and 240 patients were left without electricity, food, and health services for a while.  Long-term impact  Most home insurance claims were declined unless the insured was specifically covered by a clause concerning flood. However, the car owners were covered. The Quebec government promised monetary help but only 20 to 40% of the expected C$40 million was ever distributed. Court cases against the municipal authorities, including a class action, were rejected as the flood was considered in legal terms an Act of God. In 1988, all the cities on the Island of Montreal, regrouped into the Montreal Urban Community, set up a common Emergencies Coordination Bureau (Bureau des mesures d'urgence). In 1997, the bureau was renamed Centre de s√©curit√© civile. Following the Municipal reorganization in Quebec in 2002, most of the cities were regrouped into the greater Montreal and the center became the Centre de s√©curit√© civile de Montr√©al.

Built in 1911, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The house was built for Dr. Noble Wiley Jones and his wife, Nellie Sturtevant Jones. A graduate of Stanford and Rush Medical College (then affiliated with the University of Chicago), Jones studied medicine in Europe for several years before settling in Portland in 1906 as the city's first specialist in internal medicine. In 1913, he was hired as a Clinical Associate in Medicine at the University of Oregon Medical School (now Oregon Health & Science University) and is considered one of the leaders who helped increase the reputation of the fledgling institution. Jones chose the location for the home at the corner of Market Street Drive and Vista Drive, adjacent to Tanner Creek Canyon, then spanned by Ford Street Bridge (later replaced by the Vista Bridge in 1926). According to interviews conducted with Jones's son Dr. Orville Jones, the architect of the house was noted Portland architect Wade Hampton Pipes. The house is built in the English Arts and Crafts style favored by Pipes, but it differs from Pipes' usual style, and there is debate that this house may not be his work. The garage was clearly designed by Pipes to complement the house. Jones sold the house to his partner, Dr. Blair Holcomb, in 1927, and the house is sometimes called the Jones‚ÄìHolcomb Residence.

It was founded by Swiss philosopher Isaak Iselin, poet Solomon Gessner and some 20 others on 15 May 1762, and was dissolved with the formation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798. It was revived again from 1819 on until 1849. The latter should not be confused with the contemporary Helvetic Society for the Natural Sciences, established in 1815. History The Helvetic Society was the first patriotic society in Switzerland aimed at all Swiss people. It was inspired by Franz Urs Balthasar's Patriotische Tr√§ume eines Eidgenossen von einem Mittel, die veraltete Eidgenosenschaft wieder zu verj√ºngen, an essay from 1758 which was distributed in manuscript form and was discussed by Joseph Anton Felix von Balthasar (son of the author), Iselin, Gessner and Hans Caspar Hirzel. After two years of discussion, and a change of scope from an historical society to a more socially directed one, the Society first met with 9 members in 1761, and was eventually formed on 15 May 1762 in Schinznach-Dorf, with statutes by Hirzel, with 25 initial members. While it had an open membership structure and advocated religious harmony, very few Catholics joined, and the members were predominantly German-speaking. The society tried to be more than just a philosophical debate club like most other similar European societies, and also organised social activities, and a yearly autumn meeting from 1763 on, first in Schitznach, and from 1780 on in Olten, and finally in Aarau. New statutes were approved in 1766, focusing on the inclusiveness of the society towards all Swiss from all cantons. The aims of the Society included a democratic reform of the Swiss constitution, and education for all, influenced by the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as expressed in Emile: or, On Education. The pedagogic reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi was an early member of the Society. He was one of the contributors for the Society's magazine Der Erinnerer, established in 1765, but it was soon suppressed for being too radical and critical of the authorities. The 1766 statutes listed as the aim of the Society \\"The only goal and unique object of our Society must be to establish and conserve between the Swiss love and friendship, unity and concord; to maintain among them the taste for beautiful, noble and great acts; and to transmit for posterity liberty, peace and virtue through the care of good citizens\\". After a halting start, with a membership that stayed at around 80 until 1770, the society flourished, with 159 members by 1780 and 283 by 1797, with a steady rise in visitors as well, like some members of the Bernoulli family in 1763. Among the new members were a lot of cantonal magistrates and other members of the Swiss elite. Of the 386 members the society had between 1762 and 1798, some 90 percent held a political office at some time. In 1798, instead of an annual meeting, the members of the Helvetic Society started with the creation of the legislative assembly for the new Helvetic Republic, providing many members. The Society was abandoned, and was revived in 1819. The second version of the Society existed until 1849, when the society had become superfluous when most of its ideas were included in the new Swiss Federal Constitution of 1848.

The five-story store and office building is located on the northeast corner of SW Fifth Avenue and Morrison Street in the center of Portland's retail district. It was built for S. H. Kress & Co. in 1928 from plans by their corporate architect, E. J. Hoffman. The steel frame building rests on a concrete foundation. Its exterior is faced entirely with cream colored glazed terra cotta, enhanced with a variety of classically inspired decorative motifs. The roof is flat. The footprint of the building is rectangular; its original 100 square feet was extended to the east by a 50 √ó 100-foot single story wing in 1953 when an adjoining building was acquired and faced with terra cotta to conform with the rest of the block. The store's design is in the Commercial style of the Chicago school, with detailing in the Classical vein. It exhibits the retail base including mezzanine level and multiple stories capped with a full classical entablature that are characteristic of Commercial style emporiums. The attic, or parapet wall above the cornice carries the store's title in escutcheons centered on either street face. While the entire scheme is conservative, especially in consideration of its late date, it is a generally well-preserved and well-crafted part of the aggregation of fireproof tall buildings dating from the 1910s and 1920s which distinguishes Portland's central business district.

Life  He was the son of Henry I, the Admirable and his wife Agnes, n√©e Countess of Meissen. Henry the Admirable founded the Principality of Grubenhagen in 1291, after the Guelph princes had divided their inheritance. Ernest originally intended to follow a spiritual career, but after his father's death, he and his brothers Henry II and William jointly ruled the principality. Grubenhagen was rather smaller than the other Guelph principalities. Because Henry the Admirable had many children (eight sons and eight daughters), it was difficult to supply all the descendants in style. His eldest son Henry II could therefore not take the undivided sovereignty over the principality. In 1324, Henry concluded an extensive pact with his brothers Ernest and William under which the territory should be governed jointly, but shortly afterwards the principality was divided. Ernest received the area around Einbeck, Grubenhagen Castle and Osterode. The towns of Duderstadt, Osterode and Einbeck were ruled jointly. In 1359 he made his son Albert I co- regent. His older brother Henry died 1351 and his sons lingered abroad and died without issue, so after the death of his childless younger brother William in 1360, Ernest ruled the entire principality of Grubenhagen. After his death, on 9 March 1361, he was succeeded by his son Albert I.  Marriage and issue  Ernst married in June 1335 Adelheid of Everstein-Polle (died after 29 September 1373), daughter of Count Henry II of Eberstein.
