The problem is not limited to the modification of the schema. It, in fact, affects the data stored under the given schema and the queries (and thus the applications) posed on that schema. A database design is sometimes created as a \\"as of now\\" instance and thus schema evolution is not considered. (This is different but related to where a database is designed as a \\"one size fits all\\" which doesn't cover attribute volatility). This assumption, almost unrealistic in the context of traditional information systems, becomes unacceptable in the context of systems that retain large volumes of historical information or those such as Web Information Systems, that due to the distributed and cooperative nature of their development, are subject of an even stronger pressure toward change (from 39% to over 500% more intense than in traditional settings). Due to this historical heritage the process of schema evolution is nowadays a particularly taxing one. It is, in fact, widely acknowledged that the data management core of an applications is one of the most difficult and critical components to evolve. The key problem is the impact of the schema evolution on queries and applications. As shown in (which provides an analysis of the MediaWiki evolution) each evolution step might affect up to 70% of the queries operating on the schema, that must be manually reworked consequently. The problem has been recognized as a pressing one by the database community for more than 12 years. Supporting Schema Evolution is a difficult problem involving complex mapping among schema versions and the tool support has been so far very limited. The recent theoretical advances on mapping composition and mapping invertibility, which represent the core problems underlying the schema evolution remains almost inaccessible to the large public.

He led development of the Viking and Vanguard rockets, and was influential in the critical decisions early in NASA's history that led to the definition of the Saturn rockets, which were central to the eventual success of the American Moon landing program.

In 1940, he began work at the Naval Research Laboratory, and during World War II, he worked on missile guidance systems.Milton Rosen Papers, Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Viking rocket program After the end of WWII, Rosen worked at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), where he was involved in the definition of alternative designs for high-altitude sounding rockets, both for scientific research on the upper atmosphere, and for development of liquid rocket technology for military purposes, following the German introduction of the large V-2 rocket weapon. He became NRL project manager for the Viking rocket,\\"The Viking Rocket Story\\", by Milton W. Rosen, Harper & Brothers, NY, 1955 which was the first large US liquid-fueled rocket. Roughly half the size, in terms of mass and power, of the V-2, the Viking improved upon it in several important respects. Both were actively guided, and fueled with the same propellants (alcohol and liquid oxygen [LOX]), which were fed to a single rocket engine by turbine-driven pumps. The Viking airframe was designed and built under contract to NRL by the Glenn L. Martin Company. The engine, built by Reaction Motors Inc (RMI) of New Jersey, was the largest liquid-fueled rocket engine developed in the United States up to that time. It produced 89 kN (20000 lbf) of thrust. As was also the case for the V-2, hydrogen peroxide was converted to steam to drive the turbo-pump that fed fuel and LOX into the engine. In a series of twelve flights between September 1949 and February 1955, Viking rockets explored the characteristics of the atmosphere above 30 km, and set a number of performance records, including the highest altitude, , reached by an American single-stage rocket up to that time. Project Vanguard In the early 1950s, the American Rocket Society set up an ad hoc Committee on Space Flight, of which Rosen became the chair. Encouraged by conversations between Richard W. Porter of General Electric and Alan T. Waterman, Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Rosen on November 27, 1954 completed a report describing the potential value of launching an earth satellite. The report was submitted to the NSF early in 1955. Vanguard ‚Äî A History, Chapter 1. Constance M. Green and Milton Lomask, NASA SP-4202. NASA Historical Reference Collection, NASA History Office, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC. and http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4202/begin.html When the US decided to orbit a scientific satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), a 1955 proposal from NRL, to build a launch vehicle based on the Viking as a first stage with a second stage based on the smaller Aerobee sounding rocket was selected, and again Rosen was project manager. The maturity of the Viking and Aerobee rockets played an important role in the choice. However, there was also a strong hidden motive higher in the US government: to establish a precedent for overflight rights to Eastern Bloc territory with a non-military civilian research rocket, in preparation for the highly secret national reconnaissance satellite program then underway. This classified NRL proposalClassified NRL Proposal for an artificial Earth satellite program, July 1955; since declassified. was the genesis of Project Vanguard. Unfortunately for the timely success of the satellite project, many of the most experienced people at Martin were shifted to the high-priority Titan ICBM program, and the mature Viking team was largely lost to Project Vanguard.Rosen, Milton W., 1978. Personal conversation with Wm. A. Wheaton. The resulting shock to US pride and perceptions of national security, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial earth satellite, on October 4, 1957 (on the much larger R-7 rocket, developed as an ICBM), combined with the spectacular launch failure of the first complete Vanguard test launch December 6, 1957, is well known and recounted elsewhere. Thus the first US satellite, Explorer 1, was launched January 31, 1958 by a substantially larger Army Jupiter-C rocket, based on the Redstone missile, which had been developed by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) at Huntsville, Alabama under the leadership of Wernher von Braun. The first successful Vanguard satellite launching came on March 17, 1958. Its payload, Vanguard 1, is the oldest satellite currently in orbit, in addition to its upper launch stage. NASA and the Apollo program Rosen went on after Vanguard to be involved in a number of important NASA studies and committees that helped to define the family of large launch vehicles, designed from the beginning not as missiles, but as space launchers, that were eventually to be key components of the Apollo program. He was the principal author of a report to President Eisenhower, dated 27 January 1959,Roger E. Bilstein, Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn , DIANE Publishing, 1999, p. 36 ff which proposed three families of vehicles needed to support an ambitious National Space Program. The smallest, based on the Atlas missile, included an ambitious variant with a liquid hydrogen (LH2) ‚Äì liquid oxygen (LOX) upper stage. This Atlas‚ÄìCentaur launcher was developed, after many difficulties, into the rocket that carried the critical Surveyor series of lunar landers, used to investigate the mechanical properties of the lunar surface, and to demonstrate the capability of soft-landing on rocket power which was an essential element of the lunar program. The early development of LH2‚ÄìLOX technology also later proved critical to the capabilities of the Saturn family of large high-performance boosters. The second family discussed, called Juno V at the time, eventually evolved into the Saturn I rockets, using clusters of eight medium-sized, thrust H-1 engines to yield liftoff thrust, and nine clustered propellant tanks adapted from the Army's existing Jupiter and Redstone rockets. Although based on available component hardware in order to speed development, these boosters were substantially larger than any in use anywhere at that time, and promised to give the US parity in launch capability in the developing space race. The third family was based on the very large, single-chambered F-1 engine then beginning development. These featured two to four engines clustered to yield up to 6 million lbf of lift-off thrust, and were the start of a series of designs that eventually led to the final five- engined, lift-off thrust Saturn V moon rocket.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1913 to 1919, representing the electorate of Calare for the Commonwealth Liberal Party and its successor the Nationalist Party. He was born in Ceylon of Irish Baptist missionary parents and attended the London School for the Sons of Missionaries. He worked for the Bank of Australasia in England before migrating to New South Wales in 1885. He worked as an official for the Australian Joint Stock Bank in a succession of branches: as an accountant at Summer Hill and then Cooma and then bank manager at Milton and finally Blayney. In 1899, he left the banking industry and became a stock and station agent in Blayney, in which capacity he continued up until his election to parliament. He also purchased a 13,000 acre pastoral property, \\"Cadara\\", near Tottenham, in 1910. He was an elected member of the council of the Liberal Association of New South Wales In 1913, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives for the Commonwealth Liberal Party, defeating Labour member for Calare Thomas Brown. He held the seat until 1919 (during which time the Liberal Party had become the Nationalist Party), when he was defeated by Labor's Thomas Lavelle. An attempt to regain the seat as a member of the newly formed Country Party in 1922 was unsuccessful. After his parliamentary defeat, Pigott resided in Blayney while retaining the successful \\"Cadara\\" property. He remained active in farming circles, serving as a representative of the Carcoar and Mandurama branch of the Graziers' Association for over twenty years and remaining involved in the Farmers and Settlers Association. He sold \\"Cadara\\" in 1945 and purchased a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Manly, which he lived in thereafter. He died at his Manly home in 1949.

It is on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), one of only three NRHP locations in Daviess County, Kentucky that is not in Owensboro, Kentucky. Executions The memorial honors two Confederate soldiers who were killed in accordance with the standing order of the Union general in command of Kentucky, Stephen G. Burbridge, known as Order No. 59. This called for the execution of four Confederate prisoners for every unarmed Union civilian killed by the Confederates. The two men honored on the monument were Charles W. Thompson (aged 18) and Pierman Powell (aged 25), who were executed in retaliation for the fatal wounding of a prominent resident of Henderson, Kentucky, James E. Rankin. They were originally held in Daviess County, but were taken to Henderson by Federal troops to be killed. The two men were executed on July 22, 1864.Civil War in Kentuckyhttp://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/walker.pdf Attempted rescue Confederate Colonel Lee A. Sypert of the 16th Kentucky Cavalry (unofficially called the 13th Cavalry) tried to rescue the two men on July 21, using a bluff to draw away Union forces. However, the defenders held on until Union gunboats arrived, forcing Sypert to withdraw. The two Confederate prisoners were killed by firing squad on the banks of the Ohio River in Henderson, immediately after which the Union gunboats left the city, along with all the Union soldiers in the city. Fearing retaliation, many of the Union-sympathizing citizens of Henderson fled the city, even though Sypert sent a proclamation to the city, stating: > ...They are gone, and their murder is another crime added to the damnable > catalogue of the despotism that rules you. We are Confederate soldiers. We > fight for the liberty our sires bequeathed us. We have not made, nor will we > make war upon citizens and women. Let not your people be excited by any > further apprehension that we will disturb the peace of your community by the > arrest of Union men, or of any interference with them unless they place > themselves in the attitude of combatants. Such conduct would be cowardly, > and we scorn it. Like most monuments dedicated in the memory of the Confederacy, the letters CSA are at the bottom of the monument. Due to the placement of the lettering on the monument it is possible to misconstrue that Burbridge was a Confederate general, not a Union one. Burbridge spent years trying unsuccessfully to have those letters removed, as it angered him to have those letters after his name.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1919 to 1922, representing the electorate of Calare. Lavelle was born into a farming family in the Cowra district. His father died when he was aged 18, leaving him to support his mother and six younger siblings. He worked the family farm successfully while also taking on work as a shearer and bush worker to supplement the income from the farm. He also worked as an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union for several years. He campaigned against conscription during the 1916 and 1917 referendums and was the unsuccessful Labor candidate for Calare at the 1917 election. He sold the farm and moved to Sydney when he was 32, around the time of his election to parliament. In 1919, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Calare, defeating Nationalist MP Henry Pigott. He only served one term when before his defeat by Nationalist Neville Howse at the 1922 election. During the 1922 campaign, he was slated for his parliamentary attendance during the previous term, with reports that he had only attended 9 out of 63 sittings, the equal lowest for an MP in the House. Following his parliamentary defeat, he worked as a land and estate agent in Sydney. During the 1930s, he was the proprietor of Scott's Hotel at Wagga Wagga, then the Club House Hotel at Gundagai and then later of McQuillans Hotel at Bankstown. He also served as president of the Federated Railway Leagues Council. He was the Labor candidate at the 1930 state election, but then served as a member of the state executive of the Federal Labor Party in the wake of the 1931 Labor split, which saw most of the state branch break away as Lang Labor. He was an unsuccessful Federal Labor candidate at the 1932 and 1935 state elections and 1934 federal election. In 1940, during the second Lang Labor split, he was campaign director for the official Labor campaign against prominent Lang Labor MP Jack Beasley. He died in Sydney in 1944. He married Margaret Ann HILDEBRAND in 1920; she predeceased him 10 December 1936. They had five children.

It emphasises how internet technologies such as web browsers, search engines, wikis, online discussion forums, and social networks contributed to new avenues of learning. Technologies have enabled people to learn and share information across the World Wide Web and among themselves in ways that were not possible before the digital age. Learning does not simply happen within an individual, but within and across the networks. What sets connectivism apart from theories such as constructivism is the view that \\"learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state of knowing\\". Connectivism sees knowledge as a network and learning as a process of pattern recognition. Connectivism has similarities with Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (ZPD) and Engestr√∂m's Activity theory. The phrase \\"a learning theory for the digital age\\"Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age , International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, Vol. 2 No. 1, Jan 2005 indicates the emphasis that connectivism gives to technology's effect on how people live, communicate, and learn. Connectivism is an integration of principles related to chaos, network, complexity, and self-organization theories. History Connectivism was introduced in 2005 by two publications, Siemens‚Äô Connectivism: Learning as Network Creation and Downes‚Äô An Introduction to Connective Knowledge. Both works received significant attention in the blogosphere and an extended discourse has followed on the appropriateness of connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age. In 2007 Kerr entered into the debate with a series of lectures and talks on the matter, as did Forster, both at the Online Connectivism Conference at the University of Manitoba. In 2008, in the context of digital and e-learning, connectivism was reconsidered and its technological implications were discussed by Siemens' and Ally. Nodes and links The central aspect of connectivism is the metaphor of a network with nodes and connections.Connectivism: Learning as Network-Creation , Learning Circuits, November 2005 In this metaphor, a node is anything that can be connected to another node such as an organization, information, data, feelings, and images. Connectivism recognizes three node types: neural, conceptual (internal) and external. Connectivism sees learning as the process of creating connections and expanding or increasing network complexity. Connections may have different directions and strength. In this sense, a connection joining nodes A and B which goes from A to B is not the same as one that goes from B to A. There are some special kinds of connections such as \\"self-join\\" and pattern. A self-join connection joins a node to itself and a pattern can be defined as \\"a set of connections appearing together as a single whole\\". The idea of organisation as cognitive systems where knowledge is distributed across nodes originated from the Perceptron (Artificial neuron) in an Artificial Neural Network, and is directly borrowed from Connectionism, \\"a software structure developed based on concepts inspired by biological functions of brain; it aims at creating machines able to learn like human\\". The network metaphor allows a notion of \\"know-where\\" (the understanding of where to find the knowledge when it is needed) to supplement to the ones of \\"know-how\\" and \\"know-what\\" that make the cornerstones of many theories of learning. As Downes states: \\"at its heart, connectivism is the thesis that knowledge is distributed across a network of connections, and therefore that learning consists of the ability to construct and traverse those networks\\". =Principles= Principles of connectivism include: *Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions. *Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources. *Learning may reside in non-human appliances. *Learning is more critical than knowing. *Maintaining and nurturing connections is needed to facilitate continuous learning. When the interaction time between the actors of a learning environment is not enough, the learning networks cannot be consolidated. Mena- Guacas, A.F., Velandia R, C.A. (2020). Interaction through mobile technology in short-term university courses. In: Heliyon, 6 (2), art. no. e03287. *Perceiving connections between fields, ideas and concepts is a core skill. *Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of learning activities. *Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision. Teaching methods Summarizing connectivist teaching and learning, Downes states: \\"to teach is to model and demonstrate, to learn is to practice and reflect.\\" In 2008, Siemens and Downes delivered an online course called \\"Connectivism and Connective Knowledge\\". It covered connectivism as content while attempting to implement some of their ideas. The course was free to anyone who wished to participate, and over 2000 people worldwide enrolled. The phrase \\"Massive Open Online Course\\" (MOOC) describes this model. All course content was available through RSS feeds, and learners could participate with their choice of tools: threaded discussions in Moodle, blog posts, Second Life and synchronous online meetings. The course was repeated in 2009 and in 2011. At its core, connectivism is a form of experiential learning which prioritizes the set of formed by actions and experience over the idea that knowledge is propositional.  Criticisms  The idea that connectivism is a new theory of learning is not widely accepted. Verhagen argued that connectivism is rather a \\"pedagogical view.\\"Connectivism: a new learning theory? , Pl√∏n Verhagen (University of Twente), November 2006 The lack of comparative literature reviews in Connectivism papers complicate evaluating how Connectivism relates to prior theories, such as Socially Distributed Cognition (Hutchins, 1995), which explored how connectionist ideas could be applied to social systems. Classical theories of cognition such as Activity theory (Vygotsky, Leont‚Äôev, Luria, and others starting in the 1920s) proposed that people are embedded actors, with learning considered via three features ‚Äì a subject (the learner), an object (the task or activity) and tool or mediating artifacts. Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1962) claimed that people learn by watching others. Social learning theory (Miller and Dollard) elaborated this notion. Situated cognition (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989; Greeno & Moore, 1993) alleged that knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts; knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. Community of practice (Lave & Wenger 1991) asserted that the process of sharing information and experiences with the group enables members to learn from each other. Collective intelligence (L√©vy, 1994) described a shared or group intelligence that emerges from collaboration and competition. Kerr claims that although technology affects learning environments, existing learning theories are sufficient.which radical discontinuity?, Bill Kerr, February 2007 Kop and HillConnectivism: Learning theory of the future or vestige of the past? Rita Kop, Adrian Hill. In \\"The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning\\", Vol 9, No 3 (2008), conclude that while it does not seem that connectivism is a separate learning theory, it \\"continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner.\\" AlDahdouh examined the relation between connectivism and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the results, unexpectedly, revealed that ANN researchers use constructivism principles to teach ANN with labeled training data. However, he argued that connectivism principles are used to teach ANN only when the knowledge is unknown. Ally recognizes that the world has changed and become more networked, so learning theories developed prior to these global changes are less relevant. However, he argues that, \\"What is needed is not a new stand-alone theory for the digital age, but a model that integrates the different theories to guide the design of online learning materials.\\".Foundations of Educational Theory for Online Learning. In The Theory and Practice of Online Learning, Terry Anderson, Ed., May 2008 Chatti notes that Connectivism misses some concepts, which are crucial for learning, such as reflection, learning from failures, error detection and correction, and inquiry. He introduces the Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory which builds upon connectivism, complexity theory, and double-loop learning. LaaN starts from the learner and views learning as the continuous creation of a personal knowledge network (PKN).Mohamed Amine Chatti: The LaaN Theory.

Jim French explained the origins of Harry Nile's name: \\"It's a twisted anagram of 'Harry Lime', a favorite character from the film The Third Man. Originally, I thought I'd make Harry Nile a more mysterious character than he finally came to be.\\" The first four episodes aired as part of Jim French's anthology radio series Crisis. The first episode of The Adventures of Harry Nile aired in Crisis in 1976 and aired again under the new series title The Adventures of Harry Nile in 1977.

The magazine AudioFile published positive reviews of the 2005 collection The History of Harry Nile, Volume 11 and the 2016 five-episode serial You Shouldn't Detour Off Route 66. The latter reviewer wrote: \\"Reflecting the noir style, pace, and sound effects of old-time radio, Jim French Productions reprises one of their most popular characters, Harry Nile, played by veteran voice talent Larry Albert. Replete with the voices of a Mob boss, a squeaky-clean kid, and a gum- chewing waitress, this five-episode miniseries whips right along, accompanied by some original music on a muted trumpet. This is easygoing family entertainment.\\" John V. Pavlik wrote that the series is among shows setting \\"the standard for contemporary digital audio dramatic quality\\". =The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes= The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1998‚Äìpresent) is a radio series featuring the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle.

The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was, and still is, gloriously reminiscent of the great days of American radio.\\" The Sherlock Holmes Society of London wrote, in a review written for the publication of the scripts by Jim French, that the series is \\"gratifyingly reminiscent of the days when listeners tuned in every week to hear Rathbone and Bruce as Holmes and Watson. The main difference is that IT‚Äôs Watson, played by Lawrence Albert, is not only brave and loyal, but intelligent.\\" (Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Holmes and Watson in the 1940s US radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.) =The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes= In addition to The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Imagination Theatre also produced a related radio series titled The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (2005‚Äì2016), which dramatised all 60 of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. All of the stories were adapted by M. J. Elliott. The dramatizations were recorded and aired in a different order than the original stories were published. For instance, the first episode is based on the short story \\"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\\". The series has 64 episodes, including the multi-part adaptations of the novels The Hound of the Baskervilles (3 episodes), The Valley of Fear (2 episodes), and The Sign of Four (3 episodes). A double-length episode, \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\", combines Doyle's short stories \\"The Final Problem\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\". The episodes based on A Study in Scarlet and \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\" are also double-length, as are the episodes adapted from The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Valley of Fear.

Also in the cast were Lee Paasch as Mrs. Hudson, Rick May as Inspector Lestrade, John Murray as Inspector Tobias Gregson, and William Hamer and Jeffrey Hitchin as Inspector Stanley Hopkins. The announcer was Dennis Bateman. AudioFile published a positive review of the series in 2016: \\"John Patrick Lowrie skillfully portrays a humbler and more humorous Holmes while Lawrence Albert's Dr. Watson is wiser and even occasionally gets Holmes out of a jam. Lee Paasch is fun as the long-suffering Mrs. Hudson, who is more outspoken in these performances-- as when she begs Holmes to 'remove his silly disguises because the neighbors are talking.'\\" =The Hilary Caine Mysteries= The Hilary Caine Mysteries (2005‚Äìpresent) is a radio series following the investigations of Hilary Caine, an independent young woman who has the ability to investigate cases using a reasoned train of thought.

Hilary Caine is employed by the English tabloid Tittle-Tattle Magazine as an investigator. Her cases are published in the magazine under the banner of Hilary Caine, Girl Detective, all rewritten by the magazine staff to remove Hilary's various personality quirks and present her in the most positive light. As a result of living a real and imaginary life, Hilary is apparently confused on occasion about where fact ends and fiction begins. For instance, she sometimes claims to have met famous fictional detectives such as Sherlock Holmes. After the show's 22nd episode, released in 2017, the series went on hiatus until it was announced in 2020 that it will return with a new actress in the lead role.

Raffles, Dennis Bateman as Bunny Manders, Lawrence Albert as Inspector Mackenzie, and Gary Schwartz as Sergeant Clyde. The announcer is Lawrence Albert.

During the administration of President Clinton, he was a senior official at the United States Department of Justice. Markus was also a federal judicial nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, though his nomination was never voted upon by the Senate.  Early life and education  Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Markus earned a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1981 and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1984. As a high school student, he was selected to serve as a Page of the United States House of Representatives and delayed entering college to serve as the Personal Page for Speakers Carl Albert and Tip O'Neill.  Career  After graduating from law school, Markus returned home to Cleveland and clerked for U.S. District Judge Alvin Krenzler from 1984 to 1986. He then worked at an Ohio law firm doing plaintiff's civil rights work and representing labor unions from 1986 to 1989, while also serving as an adjunct law professor at Cleveland‚ÄìMarshall College of Law from 1986 to 1988. He left to manage then-State Senator Lee Fisher's campaign for Ohio Attorney General, and subsequently served as Fisher's Chief of Staff. Two years later, Markus became the Executive Director and Chief of Staff at the Democratic National Committee before joining the United States Department of Justice in 1994. At the Department of Justice, Markus worked as Counsel to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick in 1994, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and Acting Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs from 1995 to 1996.

The Center is known, today, as the Family and Youth Law Center at Capital University Law School. = Nomination to the Sixth Circuit = On February 9, 2000, Bill Clinton nominated Markus to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to take the place of David Aldrich Nelson, who had assumed senior status. With the U.S. Senate controlled by Republicans during Clinton's second term, Markus' nomination languished. Despite Markus waging a high-profile lobbying effort to win confirmation to the Sixth Circuit seat and the fact that he had the support of both of his home-state Republican senators, no hearing was ever scheduled on his nomination by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and no confirmation vote ever was taken by the full Senate. When George W. Bush became president in 2001, he subsequently withdrew 62 executive and judicial nominations, including that of Markus.Bush Dumps Clinton Nominees, 62 Executive And Judicial Nominees Are Pulled... - CBS News In 2001, Bush nominated Jeffrey Sutton to the seat to which Markus had been nominated.

It is known for its historic campus at 1303 Mendon Road, which includes a Gothic Revival style church along with two late 19th-century, clapboard-sheathed, wood-frame structures on the east side of Mendon Road. The church and its accompanying buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as St. Joseph's Church Complex. History St. Joseph's Parish, established in 1872 in an earlier church constructed on the present site, was, at that time, the only Roman Catholic church between Valley Falls and Woonsocket. It served an extensive parish centered on the Irish, and later French Canadian and Italian, mill laborers of nearby Ashton and Berkeley, as an important religious and social center. By 1888, the parish's growth necessitated construction of a new church, which replaced the original, although the rectory and parish hall were retained. According to the State Survey put out by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission in 1998, the present church is one of the finest wooden Late Victorian religious edifices in Rhode Island. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and underwent an extensive and sensitive restoration in 1995. Architecture The handsome, asymmetrical, twin-spired Gothic Revival St. Joseph's Church was designed around 1888-1890 by architect F.E. Page. The building has a tall, end-gable- roof, rectangular mass with a polygonal, hip-roof apse at the northeast end. One-story, shed-roof side aisles continue around the apse as an ambulatory to connect to a projecting, rectangular chapel. The three-story, shorter corner tower has paired lancet windows, battlemented string courses, louver-filled Gothic arches, and is topped by a broach spire. The four-story tower has large, traceried Gothic windows, drip molds, and is surmounted by an octagonal belfry and spire. St. Joseph's Rectory (c. 1872) is two to three stories in height with a modified cruciform plan. It is a well-preserved example of bracketed style domestic architecture, with a wrap-around veranda and applied ornament of carved brackets and jigsaw work. The interior has been modified. The relatively plain parish hall (c. 1872) has been removed and a modern structure has been built at the rear of the property.

Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron metabolism and, therefore, most genetic forms of iron overload can be thought of as relative hepcidin deficiency in one way or another. For instance, a severe form of iron overload, juvenile hemochromatosis, is a result of severe hepcidin deficiency. The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the hemojuvelin gene (HJV or RGMc/repulsive guidance molecule c). The exceptions, people who have mutations in the gene for ferroportin, prove the rule: these people have plenty of hepcidin, but their cells lack the proper response to it. So, in people with ferroportin proteins that transport iron out of cells without responding to hepcidin's signals to stop, they have a deficiency in the action of hepcidin, if not in hepcidin itself. But the exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic iron overload disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes. These genes represent multiple steps along the pathway of iron regulation, from the body's ability to sense iron, to the body's ability to regulate uptake and storage. Working out the functions of each gene in this pathway will be an important tool for finding new methods of treating genetic disorders, as well as for understanding the basic workings of the pathway. So though many mysteries of iron metabolism remain, the discovery of hepcidin already allows a much better understanding of the nature of iron regulation, and makes researchers optimistic that many more breakthroughs in this field are soon to come.

In 1819 he became professor of physics at the University of Innsbruck and 1821 professor of higher mathematics at the University of Vienna. His lectures of that time marked a new era for the University of Vienna, and they were published in 1827 in 2 volumes. In 1834 Ettingshausen became the chair of physics. Ettingshausen was the first to design an electromagnetic machine, which used the electrical induction for power generation. He promoted optics and wrote a textbook of physics. His method of lecturing was widely influential. In addition he wrote a book on combinatorial analysis (Vienna 1826). In 1866, he retired. Among his lasting impacts in mathematics is the introduction of the notation \\\\tbinom nk for the binomial coefficient, which is the coefficient of xk in the expansion of the binomial (x+1)n and, more generally, the number of k-element subsets of an n-element set.

The Spragues were founders of the Sprague Print Works in 1808, which later became the Cranston Print Works, which is the only continuously operating textile printing company in America. At the time of the Civil War, the A. & W. Sprague Company was the richest textile company in the United States, and William Sprague IV was the Governor of Rhode Island. William IV fought in the First Battle of Bull Run while he was a sitting Governor. The house The house was built around 1790. It was expanded significantly in 1864 by Col. Amasa Sprague. He added a wide hall and wide, winding staircase, for the purpose of entertaining his social contacts from financial, political, and social circles. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Currently the house is owned and operated by The Cranston Historical Society, a private, non-profit educational and historic preservation organization. Civil War cannons The Cranston Historical Society and Rhode Island National Guard underwent a years-long dispute about ownership of two cannons used by Governor William Sprague IV's regiment during the Civil War. The national guard claimed that ownership of artillery pieces returned to the federal government after the war; the historical society maintained that Sprague had purchased them outright, and were his personal property. The cannons, manufactured in the 1840s, were used by Sprague's regiment during the Civil War. They were displayed at Cranston's Rolfe Square from 1924 to 1991, and removed because the wooden carriages were beginning to rot from exposure to the weather. The cannons were placed in the Sprague Mansion carriage house from 2005 to April 2017 when they were removed for restoration. In 2017, the sides agreed to return the cannons to the Sprague Mansion carriage house, while still leaving the question of ownership unsettled. Cranston mayor Allan Fung attended the ceremony to unveil the restored cannons on October 31, 2017.

Informed for LIFE aggregates car safety data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), plus vehicle weight, into a risk index \\"SCORE (Statistical Combination Of Risk Elements)\\" that claims to demonstrate \\"superior correlation with actual driver fatalities than any other safety evaluation method\\". In September, 2012 the methodology was updated to factor in the latest testing categories by both NHTSA and IIHS. This revised methodology collates and codifies all of the NHTSA and IIHS ratings to identify the safest 10% of vehicles based on the following criteria: (1) Rated ‚ÄúTop Pick‚Äù by IIHS and ‚Äú5-Star Overall‚Äù by NHTSA. The testing protocols used by these agencies complement each other and they must both agree the vehicle has superior crashworthiness. (2) Each individual rating must be in the top quartile for frontal impact, side impact, rear impact and rollover. This filters out vehicles with individual crash modes that have above average risk. (3) Size/weight-based projected fatality rates must be less than that of the average weight passenger car. This filters out vehicles with higher than average vehicle incompatibility risk, measured as Driver Fatality Factor > 1.0 .

In an effort to remove Eddie Livingstone as owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, a majority of the NHA franchises (the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators and Quebec Bulldogs) suspended the NHA and formed the new NHL. Quebec, while a member, did not operate in the NHL for the first two years. Instead the owners of the Toronto Arena Gardens operated a new Toronto franchise. While the NHL was intended as a temporary measure, the continuing dispute with Livingstone led to the four NHA owners meeting and making the suspension of the NHA permanent one year later. The NHL's first quarter-century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League, for players and the Stanley Cup. The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario, Quebec, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeastern United States. At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup. The game itself continued to evolve during this time. Numerous innovations to the rules and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought to improve the flow of the game and make the sport more fan-friendly. The NHL played with six men to a side rather than the traditional seven, and was among the first leagues to allow goaltenders to leave their feet to make saves. The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to- coast starting in 1933. The Montreal Forum and Maple Leaf Gardens were built, and each played host to All-Star benefit games held to raise money to support Ace Bailey and the family of Howie Morenz in Toronto and Montreal, respectively. Both players' careers had ended due to an on-ice incident, with Morenz eventually dying, a month after he sustained his initial injury. These early NHL All-Star games would lead to the annual All-Star games which continue today. The Great Depression and World War II reduced the league to six teams by 1942. Founding team Ottawa, and expansion teams New York Americans, Montreal Maroons and Pittsburgh Pirates/Philadelphia Quakers passed from the scene. Expansion team Detroit Falcons declared bankruptcy in 1932 and only survived through a merger with the Chicago Shamrocks of the American Hockey League and the pockets of prosperous owner James Norris to become the Detroit Red Wings. Desperate conditions in Montreal meant that the city nearly lost both of its teams in the 1930s; the Canadiens nearly moved to Cleveland, but survived due to its stronger fan support. The six teams left standing in 1942 (the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs) are known today as the \\"Original Six\\".  Background  \\"Silver Seven\\", with the Stanley Cup in 1905 The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late 1880s. Before then, teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal (the Montreals, the Crystals, the Victorias, and McGill University) and the Ottawa HC formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup and appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip Dansken Ross as its trustees; they chose to award it to the best team in the AHAC, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge. Since the Cup carried an air of nobility, its prestige greatly benefited the AHAC. The coordination and regularized schedule that the AHAC brought helped commercialize amateur ice hockey, which ran against the spirit of the prevailing amateur ethic. As the importance of winning grew, AHAC clubs began recruiting players from outside, and the disparity in skill between teams of the AHAC and those of other leagues became clearer. Since team owners in the AHAC wanted to defend the Stanley Cup and maintain the organization's honour, and rink owners wanted senior hockey as their marquee attraction, AHAC clubs became increasingly reluctant about admitting new teams into the league and the senior series. When the relatively weak Ottawa Capitals joined in 1898, the five original clubs withdrew from the AHAC to form the new Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL). In 1903, four new teams created the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), and in 1904, the International Hockey League (IHL), based in both Sault Ste. Maries, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and Pennsylvania, was created as the first fully professional league. The IHL's ability to pay salaries caused an \\"Athletic War\\" that drained amateur clubs of top players, most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). By the 1905‚Äì06 season, several of the FAHL and CAHL markets were overcrowded; Montreal alone had seven clubs. To solve the problem, the leagues merged into the new Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), which kept four of the Montreal clubs. The new league mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters, which led to the demise of the IHL. With the IHL gone, teams from Toronto, Berlin (now Kitchener), Brantford, and Guelph filled the void with the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL). Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money, and before the 1907‚Äì08 season, the Montreal Victorias and the Montreal HC left. The ECAHA dropped \\"Amateur\\" from its name for the 1909 season, and on November 25, it folded. Ottawa HC, Quebec HC, and the Montreal Shamrocks founded the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), and the league later admitted the Montreal Le National and All-Montreal HC. Rejected CHA applicants formed the National Hockey Association (NHA). When compared to the CHA, the geographical distances between NHA teams were much greater; however, the NHA's financial backers were more notable businessmen. These businessmen applied financial principles similar to those of early baseball, and the leagues quickly entered a bitter bidding war over players. In particular, after being rejected from the CHA, Renfrew aggressively pursued any players that the CHA's Ottawa club wanted. Montreal became a notable battleground as the NHA established two franchises, including the modern-day Montreal Canadiens. With its significantly wealthier backers, the NHA easily recruited the top players, leaving the CHA teams, except Ottawa, relatively mediocre. Ottawa regularly trounced its opponents, and league attendance and interest dropped. The CHA's final season lasted eight games, and the league folded in 1910, as its Ottawa and Montreal clubs joined the NHA.  Founding  The Ottawa Senators, pictured in 1914‚Äì15, became a charter member of the National Hockey League In the 1916‚Äì17 season, the NHA was facing numerous problems. The Quebec Bulldogs were in financial difficulty, while the league's most popular team, the Toronto 228th Battalion, was called away to fight in World War I. Several of the league's team owners were growing frustrated with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone, with whom they had been having problems since 1915. Prior to the start of the season, the owners of the Montreal teams, Sam Lichtenhein of the Wanderers and George Kennedy of the Canadiens, threatened to drop the Blueshirts from the league over a player dispute Livingstone was having with the 228th Battalion. Livingstone was also in a dispute with the Ottawa Senators over the rights to Cy Denneny, while Kennedy and Livingstone had a mutual dislike that occasionally threatened to come to blows at league meetings. The remaining owners used the loss of the 228th Battalion as a reason to eliminate the Blueshirts on February 11, 1917. The Montreal teams led a motion to reduce the NHA to four teams by removing the Blueshirts, ignoring Livingstone's attempts to create a revamped five-team schedule. Livingstone was promised that his players would be returned to him after the season. The dispersal of the Blueshirts' players, organized by league secretary Frank Calder, was described by the Toronto Mail and Empire as a \\"raid of the Toronto players\\". At the same meeting, the league adopted a motion commanding Livingstone sell the Blueshirts by June 1. By November 1917, with the sale of Livingstone's Blueshirts still not completed, the remaining owners, realizing they were powerless under the NHA constitution to forcibly eject Livingstone, decided to suspend the NHA and form a new league without Livingstone. On November 26, 1917, following several meetings of the NHA owners throughout the month, the National Hockey League was created at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal. The new league was represented by Lichtenhein's Wanderers, Kennedy's Canadiens, Tommy Gorman on behalf of the Senators, and Mike Quinn of the Bulldogs. A new team in Toronto, under the control of the Toronto Arena Company, completed the five-team league. The NHL adopted the NHA's constitution and named Calder its first president. Quebec retained membership in the NHL, but did not operate that season, so their players were dispersed by draft among the other teams. = Minutes of the first meeting = > At a meeting of representatives of hockey clubs held at the Windsor Hotel, > Montreal, November 22nd, 1917[,] the following present[,] G.W.

The NHL was intended to be a temporary league, as the owners hoped to remove Livingstone from Toronto, then return to the NHA in 1918‚Äì19. Livingstone had other ideas, filing lawsuits against the new league, the owners and the players in an attempt to keep his team operating. Nonetheless, the NHL began play three weeks after it was created, with the first games held on December 19 in Ottawa and Montreal. A French language newspaper ad discovered in 2017 established that the Montreal game started at 8:15 pm, ahead of the Ottawa match scheduled to begin at 8:30 pm and delayed a short time by a contract dispute, making the Montreal Wanderers 10‚Äì9 defeat of the Toronto Arenas at the Montreal Arena the league's first game, with Montreal's Dave Ritchie scoring the new league's first goal and goalie Bert Lindsay earning the first win.  Early years  The NHL's first superstar was \\"Phantom\\" Joe Malone. A two-time NHA scoring champion, Malone scored five goals for the Montreal Canadiens in a 7‚Äì4 victory over the Ottawa Senators on the NHL's opening night. Malone went on to record a league-leading 44 goals in 20 games in 1917‚Äì18. He again led the NHL in scoring in 1919‚Äì20, scoring 39 goals in 24 games with Quebec. During that season, on January 20, 1920, Malone scored seven goals in one game against the Toronto St. Patricks, a record that still stands today. Malone was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950. The first goal in NHL history was scored by Dave Ritchie of the Montreal Wanderers one minute into a 10‚Äì9 win over Toronto, which was the only victory the Wanderers recorded in the NHL. On January 2, 1918, a fire destroyed the Montreal Arena, home to both the Wanderers and the Canadiens. While the Canadiens relocated to the 3,000-seat Jubilee Arena, Lichtenhein chose to withdraw the Wanderers, citing the lack of available players due to the war. The NHL continued on as a three-team league until Quebec returned to it in 1919. In its first years, the NHL continued the NHA's split season format. The first-half champion Canadiens fell to the second-half champion Toronto team in the 1918 playoffs for the O'Brien Cup by a combined score of 10‚Äì7 in a two-game, total goals series. The victory gave Toronto the right to face the Pacific Coast Hockey Association's champion, the Vancouver Millionaires, in the Stanley Cup final. The Torontos defeated Vancouver to become the first NHL team to win the Cup. The Canadiens won the NHL championship over the Senators in 1918‚Äì19, and traveled west to meet the PCHA's champion, the Seattle Metropolitans. The series is best remembered for its cancellation with the series tied at two wins, two losses, and a tie (2‚Äì2‚Äì1) due to the Spanish flu pandemic. Several players from both teams became ill, prompting health officials in Seattle to cancel the sixth, and deciding, game. Canadiens defenceman Joe Hall died as a result of the flu on April 5, 1919. Meanwhile, defending champions Toronto finished in last place in both halves of the 1918‚Äì19 season. On February 20, 1919, Toronto informed the league that it was withdrawing from competition. The NHL avoided being reduced to two teams for 1919‚Äì20 when the team was reorganized as the Toronto St. Patricks. The Quebec franchise also returned, (known for the season as the Quebec Athletic Club) increasing the league to four teams. The Quebec club posted a 4‚Äì20 record in 1919‚Äì20, despite the return of Malone. It was the franchise's final season in Quebec City, relocating to Hamilton, Ontario, in 1920 to become the Hamilton Tigers. Georges Vezina played 16 seasons for the Montreal Canadiens between 1910 and 1925. The Vezina Trophy is named after him. Throughout, Livingstone continued to try to revive the NHA, convening league meetings on September 20 and December 11, 1918, which representatives of the Canadiens, Senators and Wanderers determined to close out the expired league for good. = Competition with the WCHL = Beginning in 1921, the NHL faced competition from a third major league, the prairie- based Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). With three leagues competing for talent, ice hockey players were among the highest-paid athletes in North America. They commanded salaries equivalent to the top Major League Baseball players of the era. The WCHL only survived for six seasons, merging with the PCHA in 1924, but challenged the NHL for the Stanley Cup four times. In the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals, the Senators defeated the Edmonton Eskimos after eliminating the PCHA's Vancouver Millionaires. In 1924, the Canadiens defeated the PCHA's Millionaires and the WCHL's Calgary Tigers on the strength of two shutouts by Georges Vezina and a strong offensive showing by rookie forward Howie Morenz. In 1924‚Äì25, the Hamilton Tigers finished first in the NHL after four consecutive last-place finishes. While the Canadiens and St. Patricks prepared to play in a semi-final playoff round, the Tigers' players, upset that the team had turned a sizable profit despite claiming financial difficulty, went on strike to demand a C$200 playoff bonus each. Threatened with fines, suspension and a possible lawsuit by league president Frank Calder, the players, led by Billy Burch and Shorty Green, held firm. Calder then suspended the entire team and declared Montreal the NHL champions after they defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The Canadiens faced the Victoria Cougars, then of the WCHL, in the 1925 Stanley Cup Finals. Victoria defeated Montreal three games to one in the best-of-five final. In doing so, they became the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup. The WCHL ceased operations one year later, with its assets purchased by the NHL for $300,000. The rights to the Tigers' players, meanwhile, were purchased for $75,000 by New York mobster Bill Dwyer to stock his expansion New York Americans. The Americans began play in 1925, replacing the Tigers.  1920s expansion  The NHL grew to six teams in 1924, adding a second team in Montreal, the Maroons, and the first American team, the Boston Bruins. The Bruins were purchased by Charles Adams, a grocery store financier who first developed an interest in hockey during the Stanley Cup playoffs, paying $15,000 for the team. The Maroons were created to replace the Wanderers and to appeal to the English population of Montreal. The first NHL game played in the United States was a 2‚Äì1 Bruins victory over the Maroons at the Boston Arena on December 1, 1924, at an ice hockey venue which still exists today, and is used in the 21st century for American college hockey and other indoor collegiate sports. The Montreal Forum, which in later decades became synonymous with the Canadiens, was built in 1924 to house the Maroons. The Canadiens did not move into the Forum until two years later. The Forum hosted its first Stanley Cup final in its second year, as the Maroons defeated the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals, the last time a non-NHL team competed for the Cup. New York Rangers coach Lester Patrick was forced to play goal in the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals. The New York Americans began play in 1925 along with the NHL's third American-based team, the Pittsburgh Pirates. Three more teams were added for the 1926‚Äì27 season. Tex Rickard, operator of the then-new, 1925-completed Madison Square Garden, had reluctantly allowed the Americans into his arena the year before. However, the Americans were so popular in New York he felt his arena could support a second team. As a result, the New York Rangers were granted to Rickard on May 15, 1926. In November of that year, the league announced that the cities of Detroit and Chicago would get teams. Detroit purchased the assets of the Victoria Cougars to stock the expansion Detroit Cougars. The players of the Portland Rosebuds were sold to coffee tycoon Frederic McLaughlin for his new Chicago Black Hawks team. The three new franchises brought the NHL to ten teams. The Rangers reached the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals, in just their second season, against the Maroons. Lorne Chabot was injured early in the second game of the series, leaving the Rangers without a goaltender. As the Maroons were unwilling to allow the Rangers to substitute a goaltender watching from the Montreal Forum stands, Rangers coach Lester Patrick was forced into goal himself. A defenceman during his playing days, the 44-year-old Patrick allowed only one goal on 19 shots as the Rangers won the game in overtime, 2‚Äì1. The Rangers signed New York Americans goaltender Joe Miller the next day, and went on to capture the Stanley Cup in five games.  Conn Smythe and the Toronto Maple Leafs  = Livingstone's court battles = Throughout the NHL's first decade, Eddie Livingstone continued to press his claim to the Toronto franchise in court. On October 18, 1923, the Supreme Court of Ontario awarded Livingstone $100,000 in damages. St. Patricks owner Charlie Querrie made numerous attempts to prevent Livingstone from collecting on his awards. In 1923, he transferred the ownership of his team to his wife, Ida, making her the first female owner in ice hockey history. The $100,000 award was later reduced to $10,000 by the Ontario Court of Appeal, causing Livingstone to appeal to the highest court in the British Empire, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, England; the court denied his claim. Despite the reduced awards, the Querries found the pressures of meeting their obligations to Livingstone too great and, as a result, placed the St. Patricks up for sale in 1927. On February 14, 1927, the St. Patricks were sold to a group represented by Conn Smythe for $160,000 despite a potentially greater offer from a Philadelphia-based group. Among the first moves Smythe made was to rename his team the Toronto Maple Leafs. When Smythe bought the Leafs, he promised that the team would win the Stanley Cup within five years. To that end, Smythe wanted to bring in a star player to help his team. In 1930, with the Senators struggling financially due to the Great Depression, they put King Clancy up for sale. Smythe's partners could only offer $25,000 for Ottawa's defensive star, one-half of Ottawa's asking price. In an attempt to raise money, Smythe entered a thoroughbred racing horse he owned, Rare Jewel, in the Coronation Futurity Stakes at odds of 106‚Äì1. Rare Jewel won the race, earning Smythe over $15,000. Smythe then acquired Clancy for $35,000 and two players worth $15,000, which was an unprecedented price to pay for one player. It was also the only race Rare Jewel ever won. = \\"Smythe's Folly\\" = Maple Leaf Gardens in 1934 Smythe also envisioned building a new shrine for his team. He described it as \\"a place where people can go in evening clothes, if they want to come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to\\". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. They referred to the arena plan as \\"Smythe's Folly\\". To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4¬Ω months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers. Maple Leaf Gardens also featured the famous \\"gondola\\", a broadcast booth specially constructed for Foster Hewitt. Hewitt began broadcasting hockey games in 1923 on CFCA, a radio station owned by his father, W. A. Hewitt. It was an assignment he initially did not want. Smythe supported the broadcast of Leafs games in contrast of other team owners, who feared that airing games on the radio would cut into gate receipts. By 1931, Hewitt had established himself as the voice of hockey in Canada with his famous catchphrase: \\"he shoots, he scores!\\" heard first on the national General Motors Hockey Broadcast on the CNR Radio network. On January 1, 1933, Leafs' broadcasts were heard across Canada on 20 stations of CN Radio's successor, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (today the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). Hewitt's broadcasts quickly attracted audiences of over one million listeners. The broadcasts were a precursor to Hockey Night in Canada, a Saturday night tradition that continues today. = Ace Bailey benefit game = On December 13, 1933, Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore, in a daze following what he thought was a check by Toronto's Ace Bailey, charged the latter player from behind, flipping Bailey into the air and causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head. The check was so vicious that Bailey was given the last rites before being transported to the hospital in Boston. Neurosurgeons operated throughout the night to save his life; however, Bailey's prognosis was so grim that morning papers printed his death notice. Bailey survived, but he never played professionally again. Shore ultimately served a 16-game suspension for the hit, and avoided being charged with manslaughter had Bailey died. Participants of the Ace Bailey benefit game To raise money for Bailey's recovery, Maple Leaf Gardens hosted the Ace Bailey All-Star Benefit Game on February 14, 1934. The Maple Leafs defeated an all-star team of players from the rest of the league 7‚Äì3 while raising over $20,000. Prior to the game, the Leafs announced that no Toronto player would ever wear Bailey's #6 again, marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player's jersey number. Before the game, each player came out and shook Bailey's hand as they received their all-star jersey. The last player to do so was Eddie Shore. The crowd, which had fallen silent as Shore approached, erupted into loud cheering as Bailey extended his hand towards his attacker. Elmer Ferguson described the moment as \\"the most completely dramatic event I ever saw in hockey\\".  Great Depression  The sweater of the Philadelphia Quakers, in 1930‚Äì31; the Quakers were one of four franchises to fail between 1931 and 1942. While Smythe was building Maple Leaf Gardens, several other teams were facing financial difficulty. At the end of the 1929‚Äì30 season, the Pittsburgh Pirates were US$400,000 in debt and relocated to Philadelphia, to become the Philadelphia Quakers. The Quakers lasted only one season before suspending operations in 1931, along with the Ottawa Senators. The Quakers never returned, but Ottawa resumed operations in 1932‚Äì33. The Senators continued to struggle, and despite a promise by Calder in 1934 that the Senators would never leave \\"hockey's birthplace of Canada\\", the team was nonetheless transferred south to become the St. Louis Eagles. The Eagles played only one year in St. Louis before asking for permission to suspend operations. The league refused, and instead bought and dissolved the team. The Eagles' players were dispersed amongst the remaining teams. It was announced that the NHL would be an eight-team league in 1935‚Äì36. That summer, the Canadiens' franchise was for sale, after posting losses of $60,000 over the previous two seasons. Over forty thousand families and 150,000 individuals were receiving social assistance in Montreal. Owners Leo Dandurand and Joseph Cattarinich held negotiations with A. C. Sutphin to sell the club and move it to Cleveland. Just before the season, a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen, led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard, stepped forward to buy the club and prevent the transfer. = Howie Morenz = At the same time, the league reduced its salary cap to $62,500 per team, and $7,000 per player. Several well-paid star players were traded as teams attempted to fit under the cap. The biggest name was Montreal's Howie Morenz, a three-time Hart Trophy winner, two-time scoring leader and the face of the Canadiens organization. Drawing only 2,000 fans per game in an arena that held 10,000, Canadiens owner L√©o Dandurand sent his star to the Black Hawks. The Montreal fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a standing ovation when he scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1935 season. Less than two seasons later, Morenz was traded back to Montreal after a brief time playing for the Rangers. On January 28, 1937, Morenz's skate caught on the ice while he was being checked by Chicago's Earl Seibert; he broke his leg in four places. On March 8, Morenz died of a coronary embolism. Morenz's teammate Aur√®le Joliat had a different explanation of his death: \\"Howie loved to play hockey more than anyone ever loved anything, and when he realized that he would never play again, he couldn't live with it. I think Howie died of a broken heart.\\" On the day of his funeral, 50,000 people filed past Morenz's casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects to the man the media called \\"the Babe Ruth of hockey\\". A benefit game held in November 1937 raised $20,000 for Morenz's family as the NHL All-Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6‚Äì5. Morenz was one of the first players elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame when it was created in 1945. = Chicago's \\"All-American\\" team = Conn Smythe, seen enlisting with the Canadian military in 1939. In the mid-1930s, Black Hawks owner and staunch American nationalist Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager to compile a team of only American players. At the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. The Black Hawks hired Major League Baseball umpire Bill Stewart to be the first American coach in NHL history. They were led in goal by Minnesotan Mike Karakas, one of eight Americans on the 14-man roster. The 1937‚Äì38 Black Hawks \\"All-American\\" team won only 14 of 48 games, finishing third in the American division. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens and the Americans to reach the Stanley Cup Final against the heavily favoured Maple Leafs. In the first game of the final, the Hawks were forced to use minor-league goaltender Alfie Moore after Karakas suffered a broken toe. Moore led the Hawks to a 3‚Äì1 victory before being ruled ineligible to play the rest of the series by the NHL. After Chicago lost game two, Karakas returned wearing a steel-toed boot and led the Hawks to victories in games three and four, and the Stanley Cup. The 1938 Black Hawks remain the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular- season record. = Six-team league = In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Maple Leafs initially found themselves unable to counter the fifth-place Red Wings' strategy of firing the puck into the offensive zone then chasing after it, losing the first three games of the final as a result. Jack Adams' \\"dump-and-chase\\" tactic led Leafs goaltender Turk Broda to declare the Wings \\"unbeatable\\". Toronto rebounded, however, winning the final four games, and the Stanley Cup. The 1942 Leafs remain the only team in NHL history to come back from a 3‚Äì0 deficit to win a championship series. In financial difficulty, and unable to compete with the Canadiens for fan support in Montreal, the Maroons suspended operations prior to the 1938‚Äì39 season after being denied permission to relocate to St. Louis. Six Maroons players were transferred to the Canadiens while three were sold to the Black Hawks. The Americans, also struggling in New York and under the control of the league, were turned over to Red Dutton in 1940 with orders to improve the club's finances. By 1942, 90 players had left the NHL for active duty during World War II. Continuing to struggle financially, and due to a lack of players, the Americans were suspended prior to the 1942‚Äì43 season. Thus began what became known as the \\"Original Six\\" era of the National Hockey League.  Rules and innovations  Clint Benedict, shown in 1923, became the first goaltender to wear facial protection in a game in 1930. The 1920s saw numerous rule innovations as the sport evolved. The Ottawa Senators won three Stanley Cups in the early 1920s using strong defence and the goaltending of Clint Benedict, who recorded a record five shutouts in a 24-game season in 1921. The Senators employed a strategy where they kept both defencemen and a forward in their own zone at all times after they gained a lead. After the Senators' third championship in 1924, Frank Calder made it illegal for more than two players to be in their defensive zone if the puck was not. Defence continued to dominate the game, however, as in 1928‚Äì29, the league averaged less than three goals per game. Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in only 44 games. As a result, the league allowed the use of the forward pass in all zones beginning in 1929; previously, forward passing was allowed only in the defensive and neutral zones. The change saw offence rise to 6.9 goals per game over the first third of the season as players began to park themselves on their opponent's goal crease. The league responded by introducing the offside rule early in the 1929‚Äì30 season, barring offensive players from entering their opponent's zone before the puck. Despite this, Cooney Weiland, Dit Clapper, and Howie Morenz all broke the 40-goal mark, the first players to do so since Joe Malone scored 44 in the NHL's first season. Boston Bruins governor Charles Adams had long disliked the defensive tactic of shooting the puck the length of the ice (\\"icing\\") to relieve pressure. After the New York Americans iced the puck 61 times in a 3‚Äì2 win in Boston during the 1936‚Äì37 season, Adams promised that he would see to it that the Bruins played a similar style in New York. True to his word, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a 0‚Äì0 tie at Madison Square Garden. The NHL introduced the icing rule the following season, calling for a faceoff in the offending team's defensive zone after each infraction. Benedict became the first goaltender to wear facial protection during a game, as he donned a leather mask to protect a broken nose on January 20, 1930. The mask obscured Benedict's vision, and he abandoned it shortly after. Later that season, Benedict was again hit by a puck, effectively ending his NHL career. It was not the first attempt at changing how goaltenders played their position. When the NHL was formed, the league abandoned the rule forbidding goaltenders from leaving their feet to make a save. While the NHA imposed a $2 fine every time a goalie left his feet, Calder dismissed the idea for the NHL. He was quoted as saying: \\"as far as I'm concerned, they can stand on their head if they choose to\\". The phrase became, and remains today, a popular way to describe a goaltender who plays a great game. Art Ross was an early innovator of the game. He designed rounded goal nets that became the league standard, replacing the old square-backed nets. He also successfully argued for using synthetic rubber pucks rather than real rubber. Some of Ross' inventions did not catch on, however. Ross invented a puck with rounded edges that was rejected after goaltenders complained about their erratic behaviour on the ice. He also created a two-piece hockey stick that had a metal shaft and replaceable wooden blades. The idea did not catch on at the time, but was a forerunner to modern composite sticks used today.

The language called \\"Slavic\\" in the context of Greece is generally called \\"Macedonian\\" or \\"Macedonian Slavic\\" otherwise. Some members have formed their own emigrant communities in neighbouring countries, as well as further abroad. History =Middle Ages and Ottoman rule= The Slavs took advantage of the desolation left by the nomadic tribes and in the 6th century settled the Balkan Peninsula. Aided by the Avars and the Bulgars, the Slavic tribes started in the 6th century a gradual invasion into the Byzantine lands. They invaded Macedonia and reached as far south as Thessaly and the Peloponnese, settling in isolated regions that were called by the Byzantines Sclavinias, until they were gradually pacified. At the beginning of the 9th century, the Slavic Bulgarian Empire conquered Northern Byzantine lands, including most of Macedonia. Those regions remained under Bulgarian rule for two centuries, until the conquest of Bulgaria by the Byzantine Emperor of the Macedonian dynasty Basil II in 1018. In the 13th and the 14th century, Macedonia was contested by the Byzantine Empire, the Latin Empire, Bulgaria and Serbia but the frequent shift of borders did not result in any major population changes. In 1338, the geographical area of Macedonia was conquered by the Serbian Empire, but after the Battle of Maritsa in 1371 most of the Macedonian Serbian lords would accept supreme Ottoman rule. During the Middle Ages Slavs in South Macedonia were mostly defined as Bulgarians,A charter of Romanus II, 960 Pulcherius (Slav-Bulgarian population in Chalcidice Peninsula is mentioned), Recueil des historiens des Croisades.

Nevertheless, most of the Slavic-speakers had not formed a national identity in modern sense and were instead identified through their religious affiliations. Some Slavic-speakers also converted to Islam. This conversion appears to have been a gradual and voluntary process. Economic and social gain was an incentive to become a Muslim. Muslims also enjoyed some legal privileges. Nevertheless, the rise of European nationalism in the 18th century led to the expansion of the Hellenic idea in Macedonia and under the influence of the Greek schools and the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and part from the urban Christian population of Slavic origin started to view itself more as Greek. In the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid the Slavonic liturgy was preserved on the lower levels until its abolition in 1767. This led to the first literary work in vernacular modern Bulgarian, History of Slav-Bulgarians in 1762. Its author was a Macedonia-born monk Paisius of Hilendar, who wrote it in the Bulgarian Orthodox Zograf Monastery, on Mount Athos. Nevertheless, it took almost a century for the Bulgarian idea to regain ascendancy in the region. Paisius was the first ardent call for a national awakening and urged his compatriots to throw off the subjugation to the Greek language and culture. The example of Paissiy was followed also by other Bulgarian nationalists in 18th century Macedonia. The Macedonian Bulgarians took active part in the long struggle for independent Bulgarian Patriarchate and Bulgarian schools during the 19th century. The foundation of the Bulgarian Exarchate (1870) aimed specifically at differentiating the Bulgarian from the Greek population on an ethnic and linguistic basis, hence providing the conditions for the open assertion of a Bulgarian national identity.Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301 Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question by Victor Roudometof. On the other hand, the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) was founded in 1893 in Ottoman Thessaloniki by several Bulgarian Exarchate teachers and professionals who sought to create a militant movement dedicated to the autonomy of Macedonia and Thrace within the Ottoman Empire. Many Bulgarian exarchists participated in the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 with hope of liberation from the Porte. In 1883 the Kastoria region consisted of 60,000 people, all christian, of which 4/9 were Slavophone Greeks and the rest 5/9 were Grecophone Greeks, Albanophone Greeks and Aromanians.

From 1900 onwards, the danger of Bulgarian control had upset the Greeks. The Bishop of Kastoria, Germanos Karavangelis, realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and started organising Greek opposition. Germanos animated the Greek population against the IMORO and formed committees to promote the Greek interests. Taking advantage of the internal political and personal disputes in IMORO, Karavangelis succeeded to organize guerrilla groups. Fierce conflicts between the Greeks and Bulgarians started in the area of Kastoria, in the Giannitsa Lake and elsewhere; both parties committed cruel crimes. Both guerrilla groups had also to confront the Turkish army. These conflicts ended after the revolution of \\"Young Turks\\" in 1908, as they promised to respect all ethnicities and religions and generally to provide a constitution. =Balkan Wars and World War I= Refugee children from Gorno Brodi, Serres resettled in Peshtera after the Second Balkan War, 1913 During the Balkan Wars, many atrocities were committed by Turks, Bulgarians and Greeks in the war over Macedonia. After the Balkan Wars ended in 1913, Greece took control of southern Macedonia and began an official policy of forced assimilation which included the settlement of Greeks from other provinces into southern Macedonia, as well as the linguistic and cultural Hellenization of Slav speakers.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism. Dennis Hupchik which continued even after World War I. The Greeks expelled Exarchist churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgarian schools and churches. The Bulgarian language (including the Macedonian dialects) was prohibited, and its surreptitious use, whenever detected, was ridiculed or punished.Ivo Banac, \\"The Macedoine\\" in \\"The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics\\", pp. 307-328, Cornell University Press, 1984, retrieved on September 8, 2007. Bulgaria's entry into World War I on the side of the Central Powers signified a dramatic shift in the way European public opinion viewed the Bulgarian population of Macedonia. The ultimate victory of the Allies in 1918 led to the victory of the vision of the Slavic population of Macedonia as an amorphous mass, without a developed national consciousness. Within Greece, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian language, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Bulgarian intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation. The remaining Macedonian Bulgarians were classified as \\"Slavophones\\".Nationality on the Balkans. The case of the Macedonians, by F. A. K. Yasamee. (Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132. After the Ilinden Uprising, the Balkan Wars and especially after the First World War more than 100,000 Bulgarians from Aegean Macedonia moved to Bulgaria. There was agreement in 1919 between Bulgaria and Greece which provided opportunities to expatriate the Bulgarians from Greece.–î–∞—Å–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏. –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –≤ –ï–≥–µ–π—Å–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è.

Until the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) and the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 there were also some Pomak communities in the region.Theodor Capidan, Meglenorom√¢nii, istoria ≈üi graiul lor , vol. I, Bucure≈üti, 1925, p.5, 19, 21-22. =Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO)= During the Balkan Wars IMRO members joined the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps and fought with the Bulgarian Army. Others with their bands assisted the Bulgarian army with its advance and still others penetrated as far as the region of Kastoria, southwestern Macedonia. In the Second Balkan War IMRO bands fought the Greeks behind the front lines but were subsequently routed and driven out. The result of the Balkan Wars was that the Macedonian region was partitioned between Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia. IMARO maintained its existence in Bulgaria, where it played a role in politics by playing upon Bulgarian irredentism and urging a renewed war. During the First World War in Macedonia (1915‚Äì1918) the organization supported Bulgarian army and joined to Bulgarian war-time authorities. Bulgarian army, supported by the organization's forces, was successful in the first stages of this conflict, came into positions on the line of the pre-war Greek-Serbian border. The Bulgarian advance into Greek held Eastern Macedonia, precipitated internal Greek crisis. The government ordered its troops in the area not to resist, and most of the Corps was forced to surrender. However the post-war Treaty of Neuilly again denied Bulgaria what it felt was its share of Macedonia. From 1913 to 1926 there were large- scale changes in the population structure due to ethnic migrations. During and after the Balkan Wars about 15,000 Slavs left the new Greek territories for Bulgaria but more significant was the Greek‚ÄìBulgarian convention 1919 in which some 72,000 Slavs-speakers left Greece for Bulgaria, mostly from Eastern Macedonia, which from then remained almost Slav free. IMRO began sending armed bands into Greek Macedonia to assassinate officials. In the 1920s in the region of Greek Macedonia 24 chetas and 10 local reconnaissance detachments were active. Many locals were repressed by the Greek authorities on suspicions of contacts with the revolutionary movement. In this period the combined Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement separated into Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organization and Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. ITRO was a revolutionary organization active in the Greek regions of Thrace and Eastern Macedonia to the river Strymon. The reason for the establishment of ITRO was the transfer of the region from Bulgaria to Greece in May 1920. At the end of 1922, the Greek government started to expel large numbers of Thracian Bulgarians into Bulgaria and the activity of ITRO grew into an open rebellion. Meanwhile, the left-wing did form the new organisation called IMRO (United) in 1925 in Vienna. However, it did not have real popular support and remained based abroad with, closely linked to the Comintern and the Balkan Communist Federation. IMRO's and ITRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organizations, which had come to be seen as a gangster organizations inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. =Interwar period= The Tarlis and Petrich incidents triggered heavy protests in Bulgaria and international outcry against Greece. The Common Greco-Bulgarian committee for emigration investigated the incident and presented its conclusions to League of Nations in Geneva. As a result, a bilateral Bulgarian-Greek agreement was signed in Geneva on September 29, 1925 known as Politis-Kalfov protocol after the demand of the League of Nations, recognizing Greek Slavophones as Bulgarians and guaranteeing their protection. Next month a Slavic language primer textbook in Latin known as Abecedar published by the Greek ministry for education, was introduced to Greek schools of Aegean Macedonia. On February 2, 1925, the Greek parliament, under pressure from Serbia, rejected ratification of the 1913 Greek-Serbian Coalition Treaty. Agreement lasted 9 months until June 10, 1925 when League of Nations annulled it. During the 1920s the Comintern developed a new policy for the Balkans, about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement. The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the Soviet Union, which saw a chance for using this well developed revolutionary movement to spread revolution in the Balkans. In the so-called May Manifesto of 6 May 1924, for first time the objectives of the unified Slav Macedonian liberation movement were presented: \\"independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a Balkan Communist Federation\\". In 1934 the Comintern issued also a special resolution about the recognition of the Slav Macedonian ethnicity.\\"–†–µ–∑–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è –æ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏ (–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–æ–π –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç–µ –ö–æ–º–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞\\" - –§–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—å 1934 –≥, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ This decision was supported by the Greek Communist Party.

Stillborn Republic: Social Coalitions and Party Strategies in Greece, 1922-1936. University of California Press, 1983. , p. 227, 247 Contemporary unofficial Greek reports state that there were 200,000 \\"Bulgarian\\"-speaking inhabitants of Macedonia, of whom 90,000 lack Greek national identity. The bulk of the Slavo-Macedonian minority was concentrated in West Macedonia. The census reported that there were 38,562 of them in the nome (district) of Florina or 31% of the total population and 19,537 in the nome of Edessa (Pella) or 20% of the population. According to the prefect of Florina, in 1930 there were 76,370 (61%), of whom 61,950 (or 49% of the population) lacked Greek national identity. The situation for Slavic-speakers became unbearable when the Metaxas regime took power in 1936. Metaxas was firmly opposed to the irredentist factions of the Slavophones of northern Greece mainly in Macedonia and Thrace, some of whom underwent political persecution due to advocacy of irredentism with regard to neighboring countries. Place names and surnames were officially Hellenized and the native Slavic dialects were banned even in personal use. It was during this time that many Slavic-speakers fled their homes and emigrated to the United States, Canada and Australia. The name changes took place according to the Greek language. =Ohrana and the Bulgarian annexation during WWII= Triple occupation of Greece. Bulgarian occupation zone in 1941 is shown in green. Additional Bulgarian occupation zone in 1943 is shown in red surrounded by green band. Ohrana were armed detachments organized by the Bulgarian army, composed of pro-Bulgarian oriented part of the Slavic population in occupied Greek Macedonia during World War II, led by Bulgarian officers. In 1941 Greek Macedonia was occupied by German, Italian and Bulgarian troops. The Bulgarian troops occupied the Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace. The Bulgarian policy was to win the loyalty of the Slav inhabitants and to instill them a Bulgarian national identity. Indeed, many of these people did greet the Bulgarians as liberators, particularly in eastern and central Macedonia, however, this campaign was less successful in German-occupied western Macedonia. At the beginning of the occupation in Greece most of the Slavic-speakers in the area felt themselves to be Bulgarians. Only a small part espoused a pro-Hellenic feelings. The Bulgarian occupying forces began a campaign of exterminating Greeks from Macedonia. The Bulgarians were supported in this ethnic cleansing by the Slavic minority in Macedonia. In the city of Drama in May 1941, over 15,000 Greeks were killed. By the end of 1941, over 100,000 Greeks were expelled from this region. Unlike Germany and Italy, Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories, which had long been a target of Bulgarian irridentism.Mazower (2000), p. 276 A massive campaign of \\"Bulgarisation\\" was launched, which saw all Greek officials deported. This campaign was successful especially in Eastern and later in Central Macedonia, when Bulgarians entered the area in 1943, after Italian withdrawal from Greece. All Slav-speakers there were regarded as Bulgarians and not so effective in German-occupied Western Macedonia. A ban was placed on the use of the Greek language, the names of towns and places changed to the forms traditional in Bulgarian. In addition, the Bulgarian government tried to alter the ethnic composition of the region, by expropriating land and houses from Greeks in favour of Bulgarian settlers. The same year, the German High Command approved the foundation of a Bulgarian military club in Thessalon√≠ki. The Bulgarians organized supplying of food and provisions for the Slavic population in Central and Western Macedonia, aiming to gain the local population that was in the German and Italian occupied zones. The Bulgarian clubs soon started to gain support among parts of the population. Many Communist political prisoners were released with the intercession of Bulgarian Club in Thessaloniki, which had made representations to the German occupation authorities. They all declared Bulgarian ethnicity.Uranros, 103-4.Makedonia newspaper, 11 May 1948. In 1942, the Bulgarian club asked assistance from the High command in organizing armed units among the Slavic-speaking population in northern Greece. For this purpose, the Bulgarian army, under the approval of the German forces in the Balkans sent a handful of officers from the Bulgarian army, to the zones occupied by the Italian and German troops to be attached to the German occupying forces as \\"liaison officers\\". All the Bulgarian officers brought into service were locally born Macedonians who had immigrated to Bulgaria with their families during the 1920s and 1930s as part of the Greek- Bulgarian Treaty of Neuilly which saw 90,000 Bulgarians migrating to Bulgaria from Greece. These officers were given the objective to form armed Bulgarian militias. Bulgaria was interested in acquiring the zones under Italian and German occupation and hopped to sway the allegiance of the 80,000 Slavs who lived there at the time. The appearance of Greek partisans in those areas persuaded the Italians to allow the formation of these collaborationist detachments. Following the defeat of the Axis powers and the evacuation of the Nazi occupation forces many members of the Ohrana joined the SNOF where they could still pursue their goal of secession. The advance of the Red Army into Bulgaria in September 1944, the withdrawal of the German armed forces from Greece in October, meant that the Bulgarian Army had to withdraw from Greek Macedonia and Thrace. There was a rapprochement between the Greek Communist Party and the Ohrana collaborationist units. Further collaboration between the Bulgarian-controlled Ohrana and the EAM controlled SNOF followed when it was agreed that Greek Macedonia would be allowed to secede. Finally it is estimated that entire Ohrana units had joined the SNOF which began to press the ELAS leadership to allow it autonomous action in Greek Macedonia. There had been also a larger flow of refugees into Bulgaria as the Bulgarian Army pulled out of the Drama-Serres region in late 1944. A large proportion of Bulgarians and Slavic speakers emigrated there. In 1944 the declarations of Bulgarian nationality were estimated by the Greek authorities, on the basis of monthly returns, to have reached 16,000 in the districts of German-occupied Greek Macedonia, but according to British sources, declarations of Bulgarian nationality throughout Western Macedonia reached 23,000.F0371/58615, Thessaloniki consular report of 24 Sep. 1946 In the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation in 1941 there were 38,611 declarations of Bulgarian identity in Eastern Macedonia. Then the ethnic composition of the Serres region consisted of 67 963 Greeks, 11 000 Bulgarians and 1237 others; in Sidirokastro region- 22 295 Greeks, 10 820 Bulgarians and 685 others; Drama region- 11 068 Bulgarians, 117 395 Greeks and others; Nea Zichni region - 4710 Bulgarians, 28 724 Greeks and others; Kavala region - 59 433 Greeks, 1000 Bulgarians and 3986 others; Thasos- 21 270 and 3 Bulgarians; Eleftheroupoli region- 36 822 Greeks, 10 Bulgarians and 301 others. At another census in 1943 the Bulgarian population had increased by less than 50,000 and not larger was the decrease of the Greek population. =Greek Civil War= During the beginning of the Second World War, Greek Slavic-speaking citizens fought within the Greek army until the country was overrun in 1941. The Greek communists had already been influenced by the Comintern and it was the only political party in Greece to recognize Macedonian national identity.Incompatible Allies: Greek Communism and Macedonian Nationalism in the Civil War in Greece, 1943-1949, Andrew Rossos - The Journal of Modern History 69 (March 1997): 42 As result many Slavic-speakers joined the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and participated in partisan activities. The KKE expressed its intent to \\"fight for the national self-determination of the repressed Macedonians\\".KKE, Œ†Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒµ ŒßœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ± ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩŒµœÇ 1931-1936, Athens, 2nd ed., 1946. In 1943, the Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front (SNOF) was set up by ethnic Macedonian members of the KKE. The main aim of the SNOF was to obtain the entire support of the local population and to mobilize it, through SNOF, for the aims of the National Liberation Front (EAM).\\"–°–ª–∞–≤—ò–∞–Ω–æ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ì–ª–∞—Å\\", 15 –à–∞–Ω—É–∞—Ä–∏ 1944 —Å.1 Another major aim was to fight against the Bulgarian organisation Ohrana and Bulgarian authorities.\\"–ê–ú, –ó–±–∏—Ä–∫–∞: –ï–≥–µ—ò—Å–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞ –≤–æ –ù–û–ë 1941-1945 - (–ü–æ–≤–∏–∫ –Ω–∞ –°–ù–û–§ –¥–æ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –æ–¥ –ö–æ—Å—Ç—É—Ä—Å–∫–æ 16 –ú–∞—ò 1944)\\" During this time, the ethnic Macedonians in Greece were permitted to publish newspapers in the Macedonian language and run schools.\\"–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ –û—Å–ª–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–Ω–∏–æ—Ç –§—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –æ–¥ –ï–≥–µ—ò—Å–∫–∏–æ—Ç –¥–µ–ª –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞.

In late 1944 after the German and Bulgarian withdrawal from Greece, the Josip Broz Tito's Partisans movement hardly concealed its intention of expanding. It was from this period that Slav-speakers in Greece who had previously referred to themselves as \\"Bulgarians\\" increasingly began to identify as \\"Macedonians\\". By 1945 World War II had ended and Greece was in open civil war. It has been estimated that after the end of the Second World War over 20,000 people fled from Greece to Bulgaria. To an extent the collaboration of the peasants with the Germans, Italians, Bulgarians or ELAS was determined by the geopolitical position of each village. Depending upon whether their village was vulnerable to attack by the Greek communist guerrillas or the occupation forces, the peasants would opt to support the side in relation to which they were most vulnerable. In both cases, the attempt was to promise \\"freedom\\" (autonomy or independence) to the formerly persecuted Slavic minority as a means of gaining its support.John S. Koliopoulos. Plundered Loyalties: World War II and Civil War in Greek West Macedonia. Foreword by C. M. Woodhouse. New York: New York University Press. 1999. p. 304. National Liberation Front The National Liberation Front (NOF) was organized by the political and military groups of the Slavic minority in Greece, active from 1945-1949. The interbellum was the time when part of them came to the conclusion that they are Macedonians. Greek hostility to the Slavic minority produced tensions that rose to separatism. After the recognition in 1934 from the Comintern of the Macedonian ethnicity, the Greek communists also recognized Macedonian national identity. That separatism was reinforced by Communist Yugoslavia's support, since Yugoslavia's new authorities after 1944 encouraged the growth of Macedonian national consciousness. Following World War II, the population of Yugoslav Macedonia did begin to feel themselves to be Macedonian, assisted and pushed by a government policy. Communist Bulgaria also began a policy of making Macedonia connecting link for the establishment of new Balkan Federative Republic and stimulating in Bulgarian Macedonia a development of distinct Slav Macedonian consciousness. This inconsistent Bulgarian policy has thrown most independent observers ever since into a state of confusion as to the real origin of the population in Bulgarian Macedonia. At first, the NOF organized meetings, street and factory protests and published illegal underground newspapers. Soon after its founding, members began forming armed partisan detachments. In 1945, 12 such groups were formed in Kastoria, 7 in Florina, and 11 in Edessa and the Gianitsa region.\\"Les Archives de la Macedonine, Fond: Aegean Macedonia in NLW\\" - (Field report of Mihail Keramidzhiev to the Main Command of NOF), 8 July 1945 Many Aromanians also joined the Macedonians in NOF, especially in the Kastoria region. The NOF merged with the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) which was the main armed unit supporting the Communist Party. Owing to the KKE's equal treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Greeks, many ethnic Macedonians enlisted as volunteers in the DSE (60% of the DSE was composed of Slavic Macedonians).\\"Œó Œ§œÅŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒºŒ≠œÑœÅŒ∑œÉŒ∑, 1945-1949 ‚Äì Œü ŒºœçŒ∏ŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ Œ±ŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±.

It was during this time that books written in the Macedonian dialect (the official language was in process of codifying) were published and Macedonians cultural organizations theatres were opened. According to information announced by Paskal Mitrovski on the I plenum of NOF in August 1948, about 85% of the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia had an ethnic Macedonian self-identity. It has been estimated that out of DSE's 20,000 fighters, 14,000 were Slavic Macedonians from Greek Macedonia.ŒñŒ±ŒøœçœÉŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ.

At the fifth Plenum of KKE on January 31, 1949, a resolution was passed declaring that after KKE's victory, the Slavic Macedonians would find their national restoration as they wish. =Refugee children= The DSE was slowly driven back and eventually defeated. Thousands of Slavic-speakers were expelled and fled to the newly established Socialist Republic of Macedonia, while thousands more children took refuge in other Eastern Bloc countries. They are known as –î–µ—Ü–∞—Ç–∞ –±–µ–≥–∞–ª—Ü–∏/Decata begalci. Many of them made their way to the US, Canada and Australia. Other estimates claim that 5,000 were sent to Romania, 3,000 to Czechoslovakia, 2,500 to Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary and a further 700 to East Germany. There are also estimations that 52,000 - 72,000 people in total (incl. Greeks) were evacuated from Greece, whereas Macedonian sources claim up to 213,000 Slavic speakers fled Greece at the end of the Civil War. However a 1951 document from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia states the total number of ethnic Macedonian and Greeks arriving from Greece between the years 1941‚Äì1951 is 28,595. From 1941 until 1944 500 found refuge in the People's Republic of Macedonia, in 1944 4,000 people, in 1945 5,000, in 1946 8,000, in 1947 6,000, in 1948 3,000, in 1949 2,000, in 1950 80, and in 1951 15 people. About 4,000 left Yugoslavia and moved to other Socialist countries (and very few went also to western countries). So in 1951 in Yugoslavia were 24,595 refugees from Greek Macedonia. 19,000 lived in Yugoslav Macedonia, 4,000 in Serbia (mainly in Gakovo-Krusevlje) and 1595 in other Yugoslav republics.report of General consultant of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia addressed to foreign ministry of Greece Doc 47 15-7-1951 SMIR, Œ°Œë, Grcka, 1951, f-30, d-21,410429, (Œ≠Œ∫Œ∏ŒµœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç œÄœÅŒøŒæŒµŒΩŒµŒØŒøœÖ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒìŒπŒøœÖŒ≥Œ∫ŒøœÉŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒØŒ±œÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ SMIR, Œ°Œë, Grcka, 1951, f-30, d-21,410429, ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œå Œ†œÅŒøŒæŒµŒΩŒµŒØŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒüŒºœåœÉœÄŒøŒΩŒ¥Œ∑œÇ ŒõŒ±œäŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒìŒπŒøœÖŒ≥Œ∫ŒøœÉŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒØŒ±œÇ œÄœÅŒøœÇ Œ•œÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø ŒïŒæœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ, ŒëœÅ.

A 1982 amnesty law which stated \\"all Greek by descent who during the civil war of 1946-1949 and because of it have fled abroad as political refugees had the right to return\\", thus excluding all those who did not identify as ethnic Greeks. This was brought to a forefront shortly after the independence of the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) in 1991. Many ethnic Macedonians have been refused entry to Greece because their documentation listed the Slavic names of the places of birth as opposed to the official Greek names, despite the child refugees, now elderly, only knowing their village by the local Macedonian name. These measures were even extended to Australian and Canadian citizens. Despite this, there have been sporadic periods of free entry, most of which have only ever lasted a few days. Despite the removal of official recognition to those identifying as ethnic Macedonians after the end of the Greek Civil War, a 1954 letter from the Prefect of Florina, K. Tousildis, reported that people were still affirming that the language they spoke was Macedonian in forms relating to personal documents, birth and marriage registries, etc. =Recent history= Since the late 1980s there has been a Macedonian ethnic revival in much of Northern Greece, especially where Macedonian speakers have not been minoritised. In 1984 the \\"Movement for Human and National Rights for the Macedonians of Aegean Macedonia\\" was founded, and was followed by the creation of the \\"Central Committee for Macedonian Human Rights\\" in Salonika in 1989. In 1990 a manifesto by this group was presented to the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe on behalf of the ethnic Macedonians. Following this the \\"Macedonian Movement for Balkan Prosperity\\" (MAKIVE) was formed, and in 1993 this group held the first \\"All Macedonian Congress\\" in Greece.Bugajski, Janusz (2002). Political parties of Eastern Europe: a guide to politics in the post-Communist era. M.E. Sharpe. pp. 769. The bilingual Macedonian and Greek- language \\"Ta Moglena\\" newspaper was first put into print in 1989, and although restricted to the Moglena region had a readership of 3,000. In 1989 the first attempts at establishing a \\"House of Macedonian Culture\\" in Florina began.Forward, Jean S. (2001). Endangered peoples of Europe: struggles to survive and thrive. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 95. MAKIVE participated in the 1993 local elections and received 14 percent of the vote in the Florina Prefecture. According to a study by anthropologist Ricki van Boeschoten, 64% of the inhabitants of 43 villages in the Florina area were Macedonian-language speakers.Riki Van Boeschoten (2001). Usage des langues minoritaires dans les d√©partements de Florina et d'Aridea (Mac√©doine) (Use of minority languages in the districts of Florina and Aridea (Macedonia). Strates [online], Number 10. Villageois et citadins de Gr√®ce (Villagers and Citizens of Greece), 11 January 2005 According to a 1993 study, of the 90 villages in Florina Prefecture, 50% were populated only by Slavic speakers, while another 23% with mixed population of Slavic speakers and other groups. One study of the archives in Langadas and the Lake Koroneia basin in Thessaloniki Prefecture found that most of the 22 villages in the area contained a population primarily made up of former Slavic speakers. 300x300px In January 1994, Rainbow (, ) was founded as the political party to represent the ethnic Macedonian minority. At the 1994 European Parliament election the party received 7,263 votes and polled 5.7% in the Florina district. The party opened its offices in Florina on September 6, 1995. The opening of the office faced strong hostility and that night the offices were ransacked. In 1997 the \\"Zora\\" (, lit. Dawn) newspaper first began to published and the following year, the Second All-Macedonian congress was held in Florina. Soon after the \\"Makedoniko\\" magazine also began to be published. In 2001 the first Macedonian Orthodox church in Greece was founded in the Aridaia region, which was followed in 2002 by the election of a Rainbow Candidate, Petros Dimtsis, to office in the Florina Prefecture. The year also saw the \\"Loza\\" (, lit. Vine) magazine go into print. In the following years several Macedonian-language radio stations were established, however many including \\"Makedonski Glas\\" (, lit. Macedonian Voice), were shut down by Greek authorities. During this period ethnic Macedonians such as Kostas Novakis began to record and distribute music in the native Macedonian dialects. Ethnic Macedonian activists reprinted the language primer Abecedar (), in attempt to encourage further use of the Macedonian language. However, the lack of Macedonian-language literature has left many young ethnic Macedonian students dependent on textbooks from the Republic of Macedonia. In 2008 thirty ethnic Macedonians from the villages of Lofoi, Meliti, Kella and Vevi protested against the presence of the Greek military in the Florina region. Another ethnic Macedonian organisation, the Educational and Cultural Movement of Edessa (), was formed in 2009. Based in Edessa, the group focuses on promoting ethnic Macedonian culture, through the publication of books and CD's, whilst also running Macedonian-language courses and teaching the Macedonian Cyrillic alphabet. Since then Macedonian-language courses have been extended to include Florina and Salonika. Later that year Rainbow officially opened its second office in the town of Edessa. In early 2010 several Macedonian-language newspapers were put into print for the first time. In early 2010 the Zadruga (, ) newspaper was first published, This was shortly followed by the publication of the \\"Nova Zora\\" newspaper in May 2010. The estimated readership of Nova Zora is 20,000, whilst that of Zadrgua is considerably smaller. The \\"Krste Petkov Misirkov Foundation\\" was established in 2009, which aims to establish a museum dedicated to ethnic Macedonians of Greece, whilst also cooperating with other Macedonian minorities in neighbouring countries. The foundations aims at cataloguing ethnic Macedonian culture in Greece along with promoting the Macedonian language. In 2010 another group of ethnic Macedonians were elected to office, including the outspoken mayor of Meliti, Pando A≈°lakov. Ethnic Macedonians have also been elected as mayors in the towns of Vevi, Pappagiannis, Neochoraki and Achlada. Later that year the first Macedonian-Greek dictionary was launched by ethnic Macedonian activists in both Brussels and Athens. Ethnic and linguistic affiliations Principal areas with presence of Slavic speakers in Greece (pink and purple), along with other minority language communities. Greek is today spoken as the dominant language throughout the country.See Ethnologue (); Euromosaic, Le (slavo)mac√©donien / bulgare en Gr√®ce, L'arvanite / albanais en Gr√®ce, Le valaque/aromoune-aroumane en Gr√®ce, and Mercator-Education: European Network for Regional or Minority Languages and Education, The Turkish language in education in Greece. cf. also P. Trudgill, \\"Greece and European Turkey: From Religious to Linguistic Identity\\", in S. Barbour, C. Carmichael (eds.), Language and Nationalism in Europe, Oxford University Press 2000. Members of this group have had a number of conflicting ethnic identifications. Predominantly identified as Macedonian Bulgarians until the early 1940s, since the formation of a Macedonian nation state, many of the migrant population in the diaspora (Australia, United States and Canada) now feel a strong Macedonian identity and have followed the consolidation of the Macedonian ethnicity. However, those who remain in Greece now mainly identify themselves as ethnic Greeks. The Macedonian region of Greece has a Greek majority which includes descendants of the Pontic Greeks, but it is ethnically diverse (including Arvanites, Aromanians and Slavs). The second group in today's Greece is made up of those who seem to reject any national identity, but have distinct regional ethnic identity, which they may call \\"indigenous\\" (, dopia), which might be understood as Slavomacedonian, or Macedonian,‚ÄòThe matter is certainly more complex here, as the majority of the Greek citizens who grew up in what is usually called \\"Slavophone\\" or \\"bilingual\\" families have today a Greek national identity, as a result of either conscientious choice or coercion of their ancestors, in the first half of the twentieth century. A second group is made up of those who seem to reject any national identity (Greek or Macedonian) but have distinct ethnic identity, which they may call \\"indigenous\\" ‚Äì dopia ‚Äì, Slavomacedonian, or Macedonian. The smallest group is made up of those who have a clear Macedonian national identity and consider themselves as part of the same nation with the dominant one in the neighboring Republic of Macedonia.‚Äô See: Greek Helsinki Monitor, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention), 18 September 1999, Part I, . and the smallest group is made up of those who have a so-called ethnic Macedonian national identity. They speak East South Slavic dialects that are usually linguistically classified as Macedonian,‚ÄòApart from certain peripheral areas in the far east of Greek Macedonia, which in our opinion must be considered as part of the Bulgarian linguistic area, the dialects of the Slav minority in Greece belong to Macedonia diasystem‚Ä¶‚Äô See: Trudgill P., 2000, \\"Greece and European Turkey: From Religious to Linguistic Identity\\". In: Stephen Barbour and Cathie Carmichael (eds.), Language and Nationalism in Europe, Oxford : Oxford University Press, p.259. but which are locally often referred to simply as \\"Slavic\\" or \\"the local language\\". A crucial element of that controversy is the very name Macedonian, as it is also used by a much more numerous group of people with a Greek national identity to indicate their regional identity. The term \\"Aegean Macedonians\\" (, Egejski Makedonci), mainly used in North Macedonia and in the irredentist context of a United Macedonia, is associated with those parts of the population that have a so-called ethnic Macedonian identity. Speakers who identify as Greeks or have distinct regional ethnic identity, often speak of themselves simply as \\"locals\\" (, dopii), to distinguish themselves from native Greek speakers from the rest of Greece and/or Greek refugees from Asia Minor who entered the area in the 1920s and after. Some Slavic speakers in Greek Macedonia will also use the term \\"Macedonians\\" or \\"Slavomacedonians\\", though in a regional rather than an ethnic sense. People of Greek persuasion are sometimes called by the pejorative term \\"Grecomans\\" by the other side. Greek sources, which usually avoid the identification of the group with the nation of North Macedonia, and also reject the use of the name \\"Macedonian\\" for the latter, will most often refer only to so-called \\"Slavophones\\" or \\"Slavophone Greeks\\". \\"Slavic- speakers\\" or \\"Slavophones\\" is also used as a cover term for people across the different ethnic orientations. The exact number of the linguistic minority remaining in Greece today, together with its members' choice of ethnic identification, is difficult to ascertain; most maximum estimates range around 180,000-200,000 with those of an ethnic Macedonian national consciousness numbering possibly 10,000 to 30,000. However, as per leading experts on this issue, the number of this people has decreased in the last decades, because of intermarriage and urbanization; they now number between 50,000 and 70,000 people with around 10,000 of them identifying as ethnic Macedonians. Past discrimination After the conclusion of the First World War a widespread policy of Hellenisation was implemented in the Greek region of Macedonia with personal and topographic names forcibly changed to Greek versions and Cyrillic inscriptions across Northern Greece being removed from gravestones and churches. Under the regime of Ioannis Metaxas the situation for Slavic speakers became intolerable, causing many to emigrate. A law was passed banning the Bulgarian language (local Macedonian dialects). Many people who broke the rule were deported to the islands of Thasos and Cephalonia.The Rising Sun In the Balkans: The Republic of Macedonia, International Affairs Agency, Sydney, Pollitecon Publications, 1995; p.33 Others were arrested, fined, beaten and forced to drink castor oil, or even deported to the border regions in Yugoslavia following a staunch government policy of chastising minorities. During the Greek Civil War, areas under Communist control freely taught the newly codified Macedonian language. Throughout this period it is claimed that the ethnic Macedonian culture and language flourished. Over 10,000 children went to 87 schools, Macedonian-language newspapers were printed and theatres opened. As the National forces approached, these facilities were either shut down or destroyed. People feared oppression and the loss of their rights under the rule of the National government, which in turn caused many people to flee from Greece. However, the Greek Communists were defeated in the civil war, their Provisional Government was exiled, and tens of thousands of Slavic-speakers were expelled from Greece. Many fled in order to avoid persecution from the ensuing National army. Those who fled during the Greek Civil War were stripped of their Greek Citizenship and property.Decree LZ/1947; later by Law 2536/1953 & Decree M/1948, N/1948, and Law 2536/195; Although these refugees have been classed as political refugees, there have been claims that they were also targeted due to their ethnic and cultural identities. During the Cold War cases of discrimination against people who identified themselves as ethnic Macedonians, and against the Macedonian language, had been reported by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. In 1959 it was reported that the inhabitants of three villages adopted a 'language oath', renouncing their Slavic dialect. According to Riki Van Boeschoten, this \\"peculiar ritual\\" took place \\"probably on the initiative of local government officials.\\" According to a 1994 report by the Human Rights Watch, based on a fact-finding mission in 1993 in the Florina Prefecture and Bitola, Greece oppresses the ethnic Macedonians and implements a program to forcefully Hellenize them. According to its findings, the ethnic Macedonian minority is denied acknowledgment of its existence by the Greek government, which refuses the teaching of their language and other expressions of ethnic Macedonian culture; members of the minority \\"were discriminated against in employment in the public sector in the past, and may suffer from such discrimination at present\\"; minority activists \\"have been prosecuted and convicted for the peaceful expression of their views\\" and are generally \\"harassed by the government, followed and threatened by security forces, and subjected to economic and social pressures resulting from government harassment\\", leading to a climate of fear. The Greek government further discriminates against ethnic Macedonian refugees who fled into Yugoslavia during the Greek Civil War; while Greek political refugees are allowed to reclaim their citizenship, they are not. The Greek state requires radio stations to broadcast in Greek, therefore excluding the Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia (who are considered ethnic Macedonians by the Rainbow political party) from operating radio stations in Slavic. Culture Regardless of political orientation, Macedonian speakers in Greece share a common culture with ethnic Macedonians.Forward, Jean S. (2001). Endangered peoples of Europe: struggles to survive and thrive. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 94.L. M. Danforth, The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World 1995, Princeton University Press, p. 104 The commonalities include religious festivals, dances, music, language, folklore and national dress. Despite these commonalities however, there are regional folk dances which are specific to persons living in Greece. However, waves of refugees and emigration have had the effect of spreading this culture far beyond the borders of Greece.Simpson, Neil (1994) Macedonia Its Disputed History. Victoria: Aristoc Press. pp. 88. Greece has blocked attempts by ethnic Macedonians to establish a Home of Macedonian Culture despite being convicted for a violation of freedom of association by the European Court of Human Rights. =Traditions= Koleda, an ancient Slavic winter ritual, is widely celebrated across northern Greece by Slavic speakers, in areas from Florina to Thessaloniki, where it is called Koleda (ŒöœåŒªŒµŒΩœÑŒµ, ŒöœåŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±) or Koleda Babo (ŒöœåŒªŒπŒΩœÑŒ± ŒúœÄŒ¨ŒºœÄœâ) which means \\"Koleda Grandmother\\" in Slavic. It is celebrated around Christmas by gathering in the village square and lighting a bonfire, followed by local Macedonian music and dancing. Winter traditions that are characteristic to Slavic speakers in Greece, Bulgaria and North Macedonia include Babaria (; ; ) in the Florina area, Ezarki (; ; ) in the Ptolemaida area, Rogochari (; ; ) in the Kastoria area, and Dzamalari (; ; ) in the Edessa area. =Music= Ethnic Macedonian dancing group from Greece, Belomorci, performing the song \\"Egejska Maka\\". Many regional folk songs are performed in both the local Macedonian dialects and Standard Macedonian language, depending on the origin of the song. However, this was not always the case, and in 1993 the Greek Helsinki Monitor found that the Greek government refused in \\"the recent past to permit the performance of [ethnic] Macedonian songs and dances\\". In recent years however these restrictions have been lifted and once again Macedonian songs are performed freely at festivals and gatherings across Greece. Many songs originating Greek Macedonia such as \\"Filka Moma\\" (, lit. Filka Girl) have become popular in North Macedonia. Whilst likewise many songs composed by artists from North Macedonia such as \\"Egejska Maka\\" by Suzana Spasovska, \\"Makedonsko devojƒçe\\" by Jonƒçe Hristovski, and \\"Kade ste Makedonƒçinja?\\" are also widely sung in Greece.L. M. Danforth, The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World 1995, Princeton University Press, p. 106 In recent years many ethnic Macedonian performers including Elena Velevska, Suzana Spasovska, Ferus Mustafov, Group Synthesis and Vaska Ilieva, have all been invited to perform in amongst ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Likewise ethnic Macedonian performers from Greece such as Kostas Novakis also perform in North Macedonia. Many performers who live in the diaspora often return to Greece to perform Macedonian songs, including Marija Dimkova. =Dances= The Lerinsko oro/lerin dance, with origins in the region of Florina, is also popular amongst Slavic speakers. Other dances popularized by the Boys from Buf include the Bufsko Pu≈°teno and Armensko Oro. Media The first Macedonian-language media in Greece emerged in the 1940s. The \\"Crvena Zvezda\\" newspaper, first published in 1942 in the local Solun- Voden dialect, is often credited with being the first Macedonian-language newspaper to be published in Greece.Boro Mokrov and Tome Gruevski, Overview of Macedonian Print (1885 - 1992), Skopje, 1993, 150-151 This was soon followed by the publication of many others including, \\"Edinstvo\\" (Unity), \\"Sloveno- Makedonski Glas\\", \\"Nova Makedonka\\", \\"Freedom\\" (Freedom), \\"Pobeda\\" (Victory), \\"Prespanski Glas\\", \\"Iskra\\" (Spark), \\"Stra≈æar\\" and others. Most of these newspapers were written in the codified Macedonian language or the local Macedonian dialects. The Nepokoren () newspaper was issued from May 1, 1947 until August 1949, and served as a later example of Macedonian-language media in Greece. It was affiliated with the National Liberation Front, which was the military organisation of the Ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. The Bilten magazine (), is another example of Greek Civil War era Macedonian media. After the Greek Civil War a ban was placed on public use of the Macedonian language, and this was reflect in the decline of all Macedonian-language media. The 1990s saw a resurgence of Macedonian-language print including the publication of the \\"Ta Moglena\\", Loza, Zora () and Makedoniko newspapers. This was followed with the publication of the Zadruga magazine () in early 2010. Soon afterwards in May 2010 the monthly newspaper Nova Zora () went to print. Both Zadruga and Nova Zora are published in both Macedonian and Greek. Several Macedonian-language radio stations have recently been set up in Greek Macedonia to cater for the Macedonian speaking population. These stations however, like other Macedonian-language institutions in Greece have faced fierce opposition from the authorities, with one of these radio stations, \\"Macedonian Voice\\" (), being shut down by authorities. Education and language Dialectic divisions of the Macedonian language within Greece.After Z. Topoli≈Ñska and B. Vidoeski (1984), Polski-macedonski gramatyka konfrontatiwna, z.1, PAN. The Slavic dialects spoken across Northern Greece belong to the eastern group of South Slavic, comprising Bulgarian and Macedonian, and share all the characteristics that set this group apart from other Slavic languages: existence of a definite article, lack of cases, lack of a verb infinitive, comparative forms of adjectives formed with the prefix –ø–æ-, future tense formed by the present form of the verb preceded by —â–µ/—ú–µ, and existence of a renarrative mood. These dialects include the Upper and Lower Prespa dialects, the Kostur, Nestram-Kostenar, Ser-Drama-Lagadin- Nevrokop dialect, and Solun-Voden dialects. The Prilep-Bitola dialect is widely spoken in the Florina region, and forms the basis of the Standard Macedonian language. The majority of the speakers also speak Greek, this trend is more pronounced amongst younger persons. Speakers employ various terms to refer to the language which they speak. These terms include Makedonski (), Slavomakedonika (, \\"Slavomacedonian\\"), Entopia (, \\"local\\" language), Na≈°e (, \\"our own\\" language), Starski (, \\"the old\\" language) or Slavika (, \\"Slavic\\"). Historically, the terms Balg√†rtzki, Bolg√†rtski or Bulg√†rtski had been used in the region of Kostur (Kastoria), and B√≤gartski (\\"Bulgarian\\") in the region of Lower Prespa (Prespes).–®–∫–ª–∏—Ñ–æ–≤, –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–π and –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –®–∫–ª–∏—Ñ–æ–≤–∞, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –¥–∏–∞–ª–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–∏ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–≤–µ –æ—Ç –ï–≥–µ–π—Å–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 2003, —Å. 28-36, 172 - Shkifov, Blagoy and Ekaterina Shklifova.

In: > Stephen Barbour and Cathie Carmichael (eds.), Language and Nationalism in > Europe, Oxford : Oxford University Press, p.259. Until the middle of the nineteenth century the language of instruction in virtually all schools in the region was Greek. One of the first Bulgarian schools began operation in 1857 in Kukush. The number of Bulgarian schools increased as the Bulgarian struggle for ecclesiastical independence intensified and after the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870. According to the statistics of the Bulgarian Exarchate, by 1912, when the First Balkan War broke out, there were 296 Bulgarian schools with 589 teachers and approximately 19 000 pupils in Greek Macedonia. For comparison, the total number of Bulgarian-exarchist schools in all of Macedonia in 1912 was 1196 with 2096 teachers and 70 000 pupils. All Bulgarian schools in Greek and Serbian Macedonia were closed after the Second Balkan War. The Abecedar language primer, originally printed in 1925, was designed for speakers in using the Prilep-Bitola dialect in the Florina area. Although the book used a Latin script, it was printed in the locally Prilep-Bitola dialect. In the 1930s the Metaxas regime banned the use of the Slavomacedonian language in public and private use. Laws were enacted banning the language, and speakers faced harsh penalties including being arrested, fined, beaten and forced to drink castor oil. During the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II however these penalties were lifted. The Macedonian language was employed in widespread use, with Macedonian-language newspapers appearing from 1942. 116. During the period 1941-1944 within The Bulgarian occupation zone the Bulgarian language was taught. During the Greek Civil War, the codified Macedonian language was taught in 87 schools with 10,000 students in areas of northern Greece under the control of Communist-led forces, until their defeat by the National Army in 1949. After the war, all of these Macedonian-language schools were closed down. More recently there have been attempts to once again begin education in Macedonian. In 2009 the Educational and Cultural Movement of Edessa began to run Macedonian-language courses, teaching the Macedonian Cyrillic alphabet. Macedonian-language courses have also begun in Salonika, as a way of further encouraging use of the Macedonian language. These courses have since been extended to include Macedonian speakers in Florina and Edessa. In 2006 the Macedonian-language primer Abecedar was reprinted in an informal attempt to reintroduce Macedonian-language education The Abecedar primer was reprinted in 2006 by the Rainbow Political Party, it was printed in Macedonian, Greek and English. In the absence of more Macedonian-language books printed in Greece, young ethnic Macedonians living in Greece use books originating from North Macedonia. Today Macedonian dialects are freely spoken in Greece however there are serious fears for the loss the language among the younger generations due to the lack of exposure to their native language. It appears however that reports of the demise of the use of the Macedonian language in Greece have been premature, with linguists such as Christian Voss asserting that the language has a \\"stable future\\" in Greece, and that the language is undergoing a \\"revival\\" amongst younger speakers. The Rainbow Party has called for the introduction of the language in schools and for official purposes. They have been joined by others such as Pande A≈°lakov, mayor of Meliti, in calling for the language to be officially introduced into the education system. Certain characteristics of these dialects, along with most varieties of Spoken Macedonian, include the changing of the suffix ovi to oj creating the words –ª–µ–±–æ–≤–∏> –ª–µ–±–æ—ò (lebovi> leboj/ bread).—Å—Ç—Ä. 244 –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —ò–∞–∑–∏–∫ –∑–∞ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ- –°—Ç–æ—ò–∫–∞ –ë–æ—ò–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞, –î–∏–º–∏—Ç–∞—Ä –ü–∞–Ω–¥–µ–≤, –õ–∏–ª—ò–∞–Ω–∞ –ú–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞-–É—É—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∞, –ñ–∏–≤–∫–æ –¶–≤–µ—Ç–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏- –ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–æ –¥–µ–ª–æ- –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ 2001 Often the intervocalic consonants of , and are lost, changing words from polovina > polojna (a half) and sega > sea (now), which also features strongly in dialects spoken in North Macedonia.Friedman, V. (2001) Macedonian (SEELRC) In other phonological and morphological characteristics, they remain similar to the other South-Eastern dialects spoken in North Macedonia and Albania.Poulton, Hugh. (1995). Who Are the Macedonians?, (London: C. Hurst & Co. Ltd:107‚Äì108.). Diaspora Outside of Greece there is a large diaspora to be found in the North Macedonia, former Eastern Bloc countries such as Bulgaria, as well as in other European and overseas countries. =Bulgaria= The most numerous Slavic diaspora from Greece lives in Bulgaria. There were a number of refugee waves, most notably after the Treaty of Berlin and the Kresna-Razlog Uprising (1878), the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising (1903), during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), and after World War I (1918). According to some estimates, by the beginning of the Balkan Wars, the total number of refugees from Macedonia and Thrace was about 120,000. Others estimate that by the middle of the 1890s between 100,000 and 200,000 Slavs from Macedonia had already immigrated to Bulgaria. Around 100 000 Bulgarians fled to Bulgaria from the districts around Koukush before the advancing Greek army during the Second Balkan War. 66 000 more left Greece for Bulgaria after the end of World War I, following a population exchange agreement between Bulgaria and Greece. The refugees and their various organizations played an active role in Bulgarian public and political life: at the end of the 19th century they comprised about a third of the officers in the army (430 out of 1289), 43% of government officials (15 000 out of 38 000), 37% of the priests of the Bulgarian Exarchate (1,262 out of 3,412), and a third of the capital's population. The Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee and the Macedonian Scientific Institute are among the most notable organizations founded by Macedonian Bulgarian immigrants to Bulgaria. =North Macedonia= The state of North Macedonia is home to thousands of people who self-identify as \\"Aegean Macedonians\\". Sources put the number of Aegean Macedonians living in North Macedonia at somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. The majority of these people are descended from World War II and Greek Civil War refugees who fled to the then Bulgarian-occupied Yugoslav Macedonia and People's Republic of Macedonia. The years following the conflict saw the repatriation of many refugees mainly from Eastern Bloc countries. The refugees were primarily settled in deserted villages and areas across Yugoslav Macedonia. A large proportion went to the Tetovo and Gostivar areas. Another large group was to settle in Bitola and the surrounding areas, while refugee camps were established in Kumanovo and Strumica. Large enclaves of Greek refugees and their descendants can be found in the suburbs of Topansko Pole and Avtokamanda in Skopje. Many Aegean Macedonians have held prominent positions in North Macedonia, including former prime minister Nikola Gruevski and Dimitar Dimitrov, the former Minister of Education. =Australia= A large self-identifying Aegean Macedonian population also lives in Australia, many of which arrived during the early 1900s. Charles Price estimates that by 1940 there were 670 Ethnic Macedonians from Florina and 370 from Kastoria resident in Australia. The group was a key supporter of the Macedonian-Australian People's League, and since then has formed numerous emigrant organisations.Hill (1989) p. 123 There are Aegean Macedonian communities in Richmond, Melbourne, Manjimup, Shepparton, Wanneroo and Queanbeyan.Hill (1989) pp. 91,86,48 These immigrants have established numerous cultural and social groups including The Church of St George and the Lerin Community Centre in Shepparton and the Aegean Macedonian hall - Kotori built in Richmond along with other churches and halls being built in Queanbeyan in Manjimup. The \\"Macedonian Aegean Association of Australia\\" is the uniting body for this community in Australia. It has been estimated by scholar Peter Hill that over 50,000 Aegean Macedonians and their descendants can be found in Australia.Peter, Hill. (1989) The Macedonians in Australia, Hesperian Press, Carlisle, p. 79 =Canada= Large populations of Macedonians emigrated to Canada in the wake of the failed Ilinden Uprising and as Peƒçalbari (lit. Seasonal Workers) in the early 1900s. An internal census revealed that by 1910 the majority of these people were from the Florina (Lerin) and Kastoria (Kostur) regions. By 1940 this number had grown to over 1,200 families, primarily concentrated in the Toronto region. A further 6,000 ethnic Macedonians are estimated to have arrived as refugees, following the aftermath of the Greek Civil War.John Powell, Encyclopedia of North American immigration, Infobase Publishing, 2005, p. 183 One of the many cultural and benevolent societies established included \\"The Association of Refugee Children from Aegean Macedonia\\" (ARCAM) founded in 1979. The association aimed to unite former child refugees from all over the world, with branches soon established in Toronto, Melbourne, Perth, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Macedonia.Human Rights Violations Against Ethnic Macedonians-Report 1996, Macedonian Human Rights Movement of Canada, Toronto, 1996; p.111-112 =Romania= In the aftermath of the Greek Civil War thousands of ethnic Bulgarian and ethnic Macedonian refugees were displaced to Romania. Between 1948-1949 an estimated 5,200 child refugees, all ethnic Bulgarian, Macedonian and Greek were sent to Romania. The largest of the evacuation camps was set up in the town of Tulghe≈ü, and here all the refugees were schooled in Greek and the ethnic Macedonian also in Macedonian; other languages were Romanian and Russian. =United States= Most of the Slavic-speaking immigrants from Macedonia arrived in the United States during the first decade of the twentieth century. Between 1903 and 1906 an estimated 50,000 Slavic-speaking migrants from Macedonia came to the United States. These identified themselves as either Bulgarians or Macedonian Bulgarians. Their most prominent organisation, the Macedonian Political Organisation was established in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1922 (it was renamed to Macedonian Patriotic Organisation in 1952).

John Allen During the Revolutionary War, when Newport was occupied by British forces and the shores of the Bay were held by American forces, John Allen carried supplies to the Colonial Army on the Tiverton shore and served for a time as an enlisting officer in East Greenwich. Coastal settlements were vulnerable to attack, and in early June 1779, a British landing force captured Allen and held him captive in Newport for 18 weeks, burning his house and another nearby residence. Allen moved to East Greenwich, while still running his Quidnessett farm, built this current house in 1801, and returned with his family.

History of the Tamborera The Tamborera was created by Ricardo FabregaCulture and Customs of Panama in the first half of the 20th century, to exalt nationalism and identify the Panamanians with their traditions. This is recognized by journalist Ignacio Nacho Valdes, who said: \\"His compositions, of a deep romantic content, have the purpose of exalt the national soul of Panamanians, and therefore, through generations, our people have sung his songs sometimes with joy and often with a deep melancholy. \\"His music traveled to all corners of the country and internationally and has been the enjoyment of all classes The Tamborera became known throughout Latin America with the famous song \\"Guarar√©\\" that is today part of the classics of Latin American music, with \\"Santiague√±ita\\", \\"Chiricanita\\", \\"Ag√ºita de canela\\", \\"Mi negro\\", \\"El filo\\", \\"Chichaco por los aires\\" and \\" Tan Bella y Presumida\\" The genre gave life to real stars. Among these the most famous was Silvia De Grasse who brought her career to developing gender cusp outside the Panamanian border, especially in Puerto Rico, where she was recognized by the Puerto Rican television for her talent. Instrumentation Panamanian drums mixed: Repicador, Pujador and Caja, with instruments that are not part of the national foclore as organ, piano, electric guitar, trumpet, bass guitar and drums. Some Panamanian Artists of Tamborera Music * Lucho Azcarraga * Silvia De Grasse * Avelino Mu√±oz Barrios Introduction to Venezuela The Panamanian Tamborera was introduced to Venezuela in the early 1970s, by the famous Gaitas singer Nelson Martinez with the group Gran Coquivacoa. His rhythm is 2x4 as the Panamanian tamborito, and was initially played with cuatro, furro, tambora, charrasca and maracas. Soon were added bass, piano, electric guitar, congas, bongos, cowbell and even brass (trumpet, trombone and saxophone) and drums. Since the late 70s and early 80s Gaitas Tamborera was influenced by Caribbean music, especially the Salsa. =Instrumentation= The most important instruments in tamborera music are the percussion, which consist of several characteristic instruments: tamboras, furro, charrasca, and maracas.World Music Central - World Music Genres - Letter T Maracas Apart from percussion, other core instruments are the guitar and piano. Depending on the performing artist, other melodic instruments, such as the trumpets and trombones can be used as accompaniment as well. Tamborera music typically features a vocalist as well. =Lyricism= Tamborera lyrics are structured to include three verses and a chorus, with each line made up of eight syllables. Initially written about the daily life of people in nature, tamborera lyrics now range from simple phrases and words, like \\"tamborera\\" repeated with little creativity, to romantic love songs, to radical verses of protest. =Rhythm= Because of the tropical Caribbean undertones of the tamborera, this genre is musically different from its ancestral gaita de tambora or other gaitas. Tamborera music generally utilizes a 2/4 or 4/4 time signature, but this is prone to waver with great usage of syncopation.

Olyphant, Jovovich, Sanchez, and Zahn portray a group of vacationing couples in Hawaii who find their lives in danger when murders begin to occur on the island, leading to suspicions over one of the couples being the killers. Shot in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, A Perfect Getaway was released on August 7, 2009, in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed nearly $23 million on a $14 million budget. Plot For their honeymoon, newlyweds Cliff and Cydney travel to Hawaii. Driving towards a hiking trail that leads to a remote beach, the two encounter fellow newlyweds Cleo and Kale who are hitchhiking. Cliff has a bad feeling about the couple and is hesitant to give them a ride resulting in Kale aggressively taking Cleo away. On the trail they encounter fast talking tourist Nick, who claims to be a Delta Force veteran and one of the first Americans into Saddam Hussein‚Äôs palace during the Iraq War. Shortly after meeting Nick, they over hear a group of teenage girls discussing the recent double murder of a honeymooning couple by an unknown man and women. The group meets up with Nick‚Äôs girlfriend Gina at a waterfall, where they have another encounter with Kale and Cleo. Kale makes some vague threats about how hikers go missing on the trail all the time before leaving with Cleo. Nick and Gina accompany Cliff and Cydney along the trail under the presumption of safety in numbers. Tensions begin to arise in the group as Cliff and Cydney suspect Nick and Gina as the killers due to their odd behavior. The tensions, however, die down after the couples witness Kale and Cleo being arrested for the murders. Arriving at the remote beach, Cliff convinces Nick to explore a marine cave with him while Cydney and Gina wait behind on the beach. Once alone with Cliff in the cave, Nick realizes that he has been tricked as Cliff draws a gun. It is revealed that the real Cliff and Cydney were the unidentified victims of the double homicide, murdered by their impostors. The impostor Cliff is Rocky, the high school boyfriend of the imposter Cydney, and the two have been committing the murders to assume the identities of their victims. Gina, who has realized the truth about the couple, witnesses Rocky shoot Nick and attempts to escape. With Gina aware of their true nature, Rocky tells his girlfriend to mislead the police about the transpiring events while he chases after Gina. Rocky's pursuit of Gina is stopped by the emergence of Nick, who survived the gunshot due to metal plates in his head from a previously mentioned war injury. Nick gains the upper hand and holds Rocky at gunpoint, but a police helicopter contacted by Rocky's girlfriend arrives on the scene, warning Nick that he will be shot if he does not release Rocky. As Rocky tries to goad Nick into killing him, Gina gets Nick to back down. Realizing that Gina and Nick truly love each other, Rocky's girlfriend admits that Rocky is the murderer, prompting the police to shoot him when he tries to retrieve his gun. Travelling back on a helicopter, Nick proposes to Gina. Gina accepts and the two mutually agree not to go on a honeymoon.

The song was recorded in three takes for the 1964 album of the same name and reached number eleven on the pop chart, and number one on the Cashbox Magazine's R&B; charts as a single. Cooke performed the song live on American Bandstand on April 4 of the same year. It is a modern adaptation of an older gospel song of the same title. Cooke's version was later covered by many acts, such as Otis Rush, The Supremes (led by Florence Ballard), David Fathead Newman, King Curtis and Ian Moss.  Music  The song was the first piece of new material that Cooke had recorded in the six months following the drowning death of his 18-month-old son Vincent. After reaching a new deal with RCA Records, Sam Cooke received more creative freedom in his work and had chosen a fine line of session musicians to accompany him. Known for his gospel roots, Sam Cooke often used church influences in his music. \\"Ain't That Good News\\" is a secular reworking of an old spiritual. The spiritual's lyrics proclaimed the singer's faith and love for Jesus, built around gospel themes and a slow gospel tempo with an underlying pulsating drive. From American Negro Songs. Sam Cooke, however, transformed the song into an uptempo soulful number with an upbeat horn and rhythm section. Cooke's version has the same feel, passion, and soul as the original, but is about the faith and love of a woman.

History Blackdown Mill, was originally built at Three Chimneys, Cranbrook, Kent. She was dismantled and moved to Punnetts Town in 1859 to replace a post mill that had burnt down. The original mill was referred to as Cherry Clack Mill in the 1851 census, when Demas Dallaway was the miller.1851 Census of England and Wales, The National Archives, H.O.107/1638/416, page 18. The move was done by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights. The mill was working by wind until the 1920s,Sources vary as to date - Dallaway website 1924, Coles Finch 1927, Brunnarius 1929. when the mill became unable to turn to wind because of a broken curb. The mill was stripped of machinery and the cap and sails removed by Neve's in 1933. In 1946, Archie Dallaway decided to restore the mill back to working order. A new cap, of a different design to the original was built. A new fantail fitted, and the windshaft from Staplecross Mill, which was demolished in 1951, was installed. Four new sails were made and fitted in 1972. Two pairs of millstones were installed, one pair coming from a watermill at Polegate. A third pair of stones was added later. Description Blackdown Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. It originally had Kentish-style cap, winded by a fantail. When last working for trade she had four patent sails. The mill drove two pairs of overdrift millstones, with a third pair worked by engine. A saw was also worked by the mill. As restored, a beehive cap clad in aluminium is now carried, and the sails are now common sails. The sails are long and wide. The cap is winded by a diameter fantail. The cast-iron windshaft carries a diameter oak brake wheel, which drives the original cast-iron wallower on a cast iron upright shaft. The great spur wheel is a replacement, built by Mr Dallaway. Three pairs of millstones are driven overdrift. Recent photos show that the mill is missing two sails and the fantail. In 2016, high winds set the restoration back as the new mast snapped.

This underground base has been reported by several intelligence agencies, especially Indian agencies. The images collected by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) in February 2008 shows that China constructed a large scale underground base for its naval forces. In August 2020, satellite imagery from Planet Labs appeared to show a Shang-class submarine entering the underground base. Description The caverns are capable of hiding up to 20 nuclear submarines based on reconnaissance satellites data collected. The harbor houses nuclear ballistic missile submarines and is large enough to accommodate aircraft carriers. The US Department of Defense estimated that China would have five Type 094 nuclear submarines operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 JL-2 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Two 950 metre piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two carrier strike groups or amphibious assault ships. Location The submarine base is located at the point in Chinese territory that is closest to the continental shelf. It is roughly from the base to the 200 meter isobath. It is to the closest of the disputed Paracel Islands or the city of Da Nang, Vietnam. Speculation has been raised that the base is intended to be expanded to include future capability for aircraft carrier groups. The submarine base is only a few miles from the city of Sanya, a popular tourist destination and the site of a major planned cruise hub. The base is immediately next to the Yalong Bay National Resort District featuring many resort hotels.. Strategic importance More than half of the world's annual merchant fleet tonnage passes through the Strait of Malacca, Sunda Strait, and Lombok Strait, with the majority continuing on into the South China Sea. Tanker traffic through the Strait of Malacca leading into the South China Sea is more than three times greater than Suez Canal traffic, and well over five times more than the Panama Canal. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stated its claim to almost the entire body of water and is currently building multiple bases in the South China Sea to control them.

His two surviving pieces are composed in Old Occitan. His first name is also spelled Lauren√ß () in modern Occitan and Lloren√ß () in modern Catalan. Loren√ß presented a certain vers figurat (figured verse), Sobre¬∑l pus alt de tots los cims d'un arbre, to the Consistori del Gay Saber in Toulouse, a mystic allegory of Jesus Christ (Ihus lo salvaire), who is the auzel(l)et tot blanch (little all-white bird), and the Jews, who are a corps mot vils (most vile corpse). The arbre (tree) signifies la vera crotz (the true cross). The poem has two tornadas, one to Mon Ric(h) Thesaur (my rich treasure), a senhal (code name) for the Virgin Mary and another to the seven lords (senyor set) of the consistori del Gay Sauber. It is Enrich de Villena, a lord of the Consistori de Barcelona, who informs us that this was not that consistori but the one of Toulouse, since the piece was written before the foundation in Barcelona (1393). The Marian reference is very typical for the Consistori of Toulouse and this poem is usually classed as a religious sirventes.Dictionnaire de l'occitan m√©di√©val: L, LorMall, citing Fran√ßois Zufferey, Bibliographie des po√®tes proven√ßaux des XIVe et XVe si√®cles (Geneva, 1981), 530, I. It is unknown if it won a prize at the joc florals or even when it was composed. More useful for garnering an understanding of Catalan and Occitan literature of the period, is Loren√ß' escondig (escondit), which cannot be connected to the Consistori or its competitions. Moltes de vetz, dompna, ¬∑m suy presentatz, as it begins, describes how certain jealous men (lauzengiers) told his lady that Loren√ß was bragging that she loved him, a discourteous violation of the secrecy of love. Loren√ß denies the charge in a way clearly inspired by Petrarch's fifteenth canzone, which begins S'i'l dissi mai (\\"If I ever said that\\").Ernest H. Wilkins (1950), \\"A General Survey of Renaissance Petrarchism,\\" Comparative Literature, 2:4 (Autumn), 332. This line, translated into Occitan, is how the main (14 of 17) stanzas of Loren√ß' 132-line poem begin: Si¬∑u digu√≠ may. The poet then describes the horrible fate which would await him for so treacherous a betrayal. The tornada employs the same senhal, Mon Rich Thesaur, as the religious poem, this time for an anonymous lady presumably not the Virgin. From another direction Loren√ß seems influenced by Bertran de Born, who wrote the only escondig attributable to a troubadour.Henry John Chaytor (1933), A History of Aragon and Catalonia (London: Methuen Publishing), 271. In Loren√ß, Renaissance Petrarchism and reactionary troubadourism are combined. Despite this, Loren√ß is not avant garde. His poetry is not of especial literary quality, nor is his imitation of Petrarch the beginning of a trend. He did not borrow from Petrarch any of the latter's superior poetic innovations. Rather, he so happens to be one of the few Catalans of his time to find in Petrarch and the Italians things worth copying and fitting into their troubadouresque structures.

He also made a single appearance for England in 1961. Career Angus was born in Amble, Northumberland and played for the local boys' club before being signed by Burnley as an amateur at the age of 16 in 1954. A year later, he was signed as a professional on his 17th birthday. At first, he struggled to win a place in the reserve team with the quality of players then at Turf Moor and was less than a week away from his 18th birthday before his reserve team debut. A week after that debut, however, he was called into the first team after the club were hit with a number of injuries and he performed well in a 2‚Äì1 victory against Everton on 3 September 1956 giving international winger Tommy Eglington a difficult time. Over the next two seasons he made a number of appearances in the first team but in 1958 new manager Harry Potts made Angus the regular right back, displacing Dave Smith. Angus was a superb defender and became an integral part of the Burnley side which won the Football League title in 1960, and were runners-up in both the league and FA Cup in 1962. He was capped at U23 seven times. His full cap came on 27 May 1961, when he and Burnley teammate Brian Miller made their England debuts in the same game against Austria in Vienna. Angus was played out of position having to play at left-back, replacing Ray Wilson. England were defeated by three goals to one (from Jimmy Greaves).Austria 3 ‚Äì England 1; 27 May 1961 (Match summary) Unfortunately for Angus, England already had Jimmy Armfield and then George Cohen available at right back, and Angus was not selected again. Angus continued his good form for Burnley as the title winning team was dismantled, and he had almost reached the age of 30 before his place was under threat. but the emergence of Fred Smith saw him out of the side for spells. In 1971, Burnley were relegated from the First Division; Angus was in the Second Division side for the first two games of the 1971‚Äì72 season before a tendon injury forced him out. Although he was hopeful of a recovery, this was not to be and he retired at the end of the season. He had played in a total of 439 league games for Burnley and with cup games totalled 521 appearances. His four goals all came between 1964 and 1966.

It was a political declaration against the Hungarian system of government that did away with Transylvania's long-standing autonomy. It reaffirmed the principles and objectives outlined in the National petition of 1848 and called for the autonomy of Transylvania, the reopening of the Diet on the basis of proportional representation and the recognition of laws approved by the Diet of Hermannstadt (Sibiu) (1863‚Äì64), which recognised the rights of the Romanian nation, including that of proportional representation. It specified that Romanians did not recognise the Parliament of Hungary or its right to make laws for Transylvania. The Pronouncement was published in the Romanian- language press of Transylvania, in Romania and in Western nations.

Taking Indian citizenship, he founded the Syro-Malankara rite Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram, later (in 1998) affiliated to the Trappist Order. His sainthood cause is underway.  Early life  Jean Richard Mahieu was born in Ypres, Belgium, the fifth son of the seven children of Ren√© Mahieu and his wife Anne (n√©e Vandelanotte). He had his early education and college studies in Brussels. At the age of twenty he went to England for higher studies. In 1931, he was very much impressed by Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs visit to London, when Gandhi came to participate in the second Round Table Conference as - some English politician said - 'a half naked fakir'. The young man sympathized with Gandhi's non- violent fight for India's independence. As his own spiritual development unfolded, he saw in Gandhi a fellow traveller on the path toward a more spiritual and more harmonious world civilization based on a balance between action and contemplation, combining the best of East and West. In 1932, Jean Richard had to complete his compulsory military service, in Belgium. During this time, he decided to become a monk, join the Cistercian (Trappist) Order, and go to India to lead a contemplative life in an ashram. He asked his father's permission which was denied: his father was totally opposed to such a vocation. In 1935, the young man joined a group of pilgrims going to Rome.  Monastic Life  In an audience with Pope Pius XI, he expressed his desires and asked prayers for his future vocation. In September 1935, at the age of 23, Jean Richard joined the Cistercian Abbey of Our Lady of Scourmont, near Chimay, Belgium. He received a new name in religion, Francis, with St. Francis of Assisi as his chosen patron. After his novitiate formation, Francis made his first vows and was sent to the Gregorian University in Rome to obtain a degree of Bachelor of Divinity. He then did further theological studies at the University of Louvain in Belgium. He made solemn vows in 1940 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1941. Soon thereafter, he was appointed novice master at Scourmont. At this time, the abbot of Scourmont was planning to start a Cistercian monastery in India, which corresponded well with the wishes of Fr. Francis. Somewhat later, the abbot's interests began to turn toward Africa. Nonetheless, Fr. Francis was given permission to undertake a foundation by himself in India.  To India  It was very difficult to get a visa for India from Belgium. However, Scourmont had a daughter house in Wales and Fr. Francis was given the opportunity to go to this monastery on Caldey Island as its novice master. After three unsuccessful applications for a visa for India he was eventually granted one through the recommendation of Vijayalaksmi Pandit, who was High Commissioner in England. Impressed by Fr. Francis's wish to work for the encounter between Christianity and Hinduism and by his determination to start a Christian monastic foundation rooted in the ashram tradition of India, Pandit Nehru, who was then the prime minister of India, approved the application on the condition that he not proselytize. Fr. Francis set sail for India and arrived in Bombay on 12 July 1955.Swami Abhishiktananda welcomed him. In Bombay Fr. Francis‚Äô initiation to India was begun with visits to various ancient sites: Buddhist caves at Kanheri, the island of Elephanta, and Ajanta. At Elephanta, Fr. Francis and Abhishiktananda were profoundly impressed by the central cave, a magnificent temple with immense bas-reliefs (7th century) carved in the solid rock, dedicated to Shiva Maheshwara in his different manifestations. They passed the night in the cave, where the sight of Maheshwara Sadashiva (a huge carving of Shiva with three faces) had moved Swami Abhshiktananda to ecstasy. However, the meeting of the two monks, so long anticipated, was not entirely happy, probably on account of the inner turmoil that was tormenting Swami Abhishiktananda at that time. In any case, after visiting Ajanta, Abhishiktananda went on alone to explore north India, while his companion returned to Bombay. Fr. Francis spent about one year in the ashram at Shantivanam with Jules Monchanin and Swami Abhshiktananda; he considered this year to be a period of novitiate for him in India with the two earlier pioneers on the same path. Afterwards, in November, 1956, Fr. Francis left Shantivanam for Kerala.  Foundation of Kurisumala Ashram  It was at the invitation of Zacharias Mar Athanasios, the Bishop of Tiruvalla, that Fr. Francis came to Kerala to start the ashram. In the course of time, Bede Griffiths joined him there. On 1 December 1956, the two of them started the new foundation Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj,Kurisumala Ashram at Tiruvalla in the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. Eventually they were successful in obtaining of land and on 20 March 1958, the eve of Saint Benedict‚Äôs day, Fr. Francis, Fr. Bede, and two seminarians travelled sixty miles to the site, high up on the holy mountain of Kurisumala. Well contented with their hilltop, they spent the next few months in a hut made of bamboo and plaited palm leaves with no facilities, no furniture, and a floor covered simply with cow dung. While the centre of their lives was the prayer of the Church and celebration of its feasts and mysteries, they had to find a way of supporting themselves, so they soon started a dairy farm with cattle imported from Jersey. On 6 August 1968, Fr. Francis took Indian citizenship. Later the same month Fr. Bede, after ten years in Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj,Kurisumala Ashram, left for Shantivanam with two brothers, Br. Anugrah and Br. Ajit, to take over that ashram from Swami Abhishiktananda. By 1974, Fr. Francis's health was declining. For several months he underwent Ayurvedic treatment, staying in a Hindu doctor's house at Geethabhavan, Kottayam. In 1979, he returned to Belgium, back to the monastery of his youth, Scourmont Abbey, and in a hospital near the abbey he had a hip operation, which was not very successful. He returned to Kurisumala and soon the other hip was also affected. Already at an advanced age and battling against pain, fear, and ill health, he started and completed his masterpiece, the Prayer with the Harp of Spirit, four volumes translated from the ancient Syrian book Panqitho, with certain adaptations to Indian culture.  Kurisumala Ashram, a Cistercian abbey  In 1996, Fr. Francis went to Rome, together with Bishop Geevarghese Mar Timotheos, to ask the General Chapter of the Cistercians of the Strict Observance to affiliate Kurisumala as a monastery of their order. After the necessary procedures were carried out, Kurisamala Ashram became a Cistercian abbey on 9 July 1998, with Fr. Francis being installed as the first abbot.  Final days  Acharya died at Tiruvalla on the morning of 31 January 2002, after receiving Holy Communion. His mortal remains were kept until 4 February at Pushpagiri Medical College, Thiruvalla.

It lay in southeastern Thessaly, between Mount Othrys and the northern shore of the Pagasetic Gulf. Inhabited by perioikoi, it was originally formally not a part of Thessaly proper but a Thessalian dependency, and had a seat of its own in the Delphic Amphictyony. From 363 BC it came under Boeotian control, but split away during the Lamian War. In the 3rd century BC it became a member of the Aetolian League, until declared free and autonomous by the Roman Republic in 196 BC, following the Second Macedonian War, and re-incorporated into Thessaly. Phthiotis was inhabited by the Achaean Phthiotae (·ºàœáŒ±ŒπŒø·Ω∂ Œ¶Œ∏Œπ·ø∂œÑŒ±Œπ), under which name they are usually mentioned as members of the Amphictyonic League. This district, according to Strabo, included the southern part of Thessaly, extending from the Maliac Gulf on the east, to Dolopia and Mount Pindus on the west, and stretching as far north as Pharsalus and the Thessalian plains. Phthiotis derived its name from the Homeric Phthia (Œ¶Œ∏ŒØŒ∑), which appears to have included in the heroic times not only Hellas and Dolopia, which is expressly called the furthest part of Phthia, but also the southern portion of the Thessalian plain, since it is probable that Phthia was also the ancient name of Pharsalus. The cities of Phthiotis were: Amphanaeum or Amphanae, on the promontory Pyrrha and on the Pagasaean Gulf; Phthiotic Thebes, Eretria, Phylace, Iton, Halus, Pteleum, Antron, Larissa Cremaste, Proerna, Pras, Narthacium, Thaumaci, Melitaea, Coroneia, Xyniae, Lamia, Phalara, and Echinus. It has given its name to the modern prefecture of Phthiotis. The Phthiotis Prefecture however lies to the south of the historical region and does not include it.

Life Otto Ritter von Dandl was born in Straubing, Lower Bavaria, in 1868, his parents being Georg Ritter von Dandl and Karoline Weninger. He studied law and graduated in 1890. He entered the Bavarian government service, becoming a judge at the court in Munich. He rose through the ranks quickly, occupying a position in the justice department from 1900. In 1906, von Dandl became an adviser of Prinzregent Luitpold, who ruled Bavaria in his nephew's, King Otto's stead. With the death of Luitpold in 1912, his son Ludwig took up the position as Prinzregent (Prince Regent) of Bavaria and von Dandl became the chief of his cabinet. Ludwig acceded to the throne of Bavaria as Ludwig III in 1913 and bestowed the title of Staatsrat on von Dandl. In 1917, when Germany's situation had gradually worsened due to World War I, Otto Ritter von Dandl was made Minister of State of the Royal Household and of the Exterior and President of the Council of Ministers on 11 November 1917, a title equivalent to Prime Minister of Bavaria. On 2 November 1918, von Dandl reached an agreement with all major parties, to reform Bavaria and to build a new coalition government with him as leaders and prominent members of the Zentrumspartei and the SPD in ministerial posts. The event of the German surrender a few days after meant, this government never came to be. It would have included three future Bavarian prime ministers, Heinrich Held, Eugen von Knilling and Johannes Hoffmann as ministers.Parlamentarische Reformversuche (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 10 May 2008 He only held this position for one year; with the collapse of Imperial Germany, the Kingdom of Bavaria was abolished by Kurt Eisner on 8 November 1918, who succeeded him to the office of prime minister, making von Dandl the last prime minister of the Kingdom of Bavaria.Historisches Lexikon Bayerns - Staatsministerium des √Ñu√üern (in German) accessed: 10 May 2008 On 12 November 1918, Dandl went to Schloss Anif, near Salzburg, to see the King and obtain what is known as the Anifer Erkl√§rung (Anif declaration) in which the King released all government officials, soldiers and officers from their oath to him, but made no declaration of resignation. The Eisner government published the declaration when Dandl returned to Munich the next day, interpreting it, somewhat ambiguously, as the end to Wittelsbacher rule.Anifer Erkl√§rung, 12./13. November 1918 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 10 May 2008 Von Dandl remained in government service, becoming the director of the taxation department in W√ºrzburg in 1919. From 1929 to 1933, he held the same position in Munich. In his town of birth, Straubing, a street is named after him, the Otto-von-Dandl-Ring. Ritter, as in the name Otto Ritter von Dandl, is not a name but a noble title, considered roughly equal to the title Knight or Baronet.

The reading is based on information gained in the bidding and the play to previous tricks. The technique is used by the declarer and defenders primarily to determine the probable suit distribution and card holdings of each unseen ; determination of the location of specific spot-cards may be critical as well. Card reading is based on the fact that there are thirteen cards in each of four suits and thirteen cards in each of four hands.  General tips  = Basic = There are some basic tips: * The player could memorize the common patterns of the 13 cards, in a suit, as held by the 4 players: 4432, 4333, 4441, 5332, 5431, 5422, 6322, 6331, etc. If a player discovers that each opponent has 3 cards in a suit, and the player holds 2 cards, then no arithmetic is needed to know that the partner holds the remaining 5 cards of the suit, because the \\"5332\\" pattern will come to mind. *Concentration on the distribution of the unseen cards is considered an important aspect of card counting and, after this skill is mastered, the counter is then able to recognize common patterns. That is, the counter can then start thinking not just about the number of outstanding cards in a suit, but also about how the cards might \\"break\\" (the section below, \\"Counting trumps\\" provides an example). *It is recommended that a single unseen hand is observed first, with the most straightforward hand belonging to: **the player who made the most bids during the auction **the player who made the opening lead **the player who has a long suit *Card counting in bridge is considered a very difficult practice to learn, with speedier progress possible through concentration upon one or two suits for every deal played, regardless of the potential influence of the respective hand; through this process, the brain becomes adept at remembering cards. = Advanced = The advanced tips include: *Memorize the original layout. Whether declaring or defending, the player can study the dummy hand at trick one and create a mental picture of its distribution. Commit it to memory by repeating the pattern in the mind (for example: 3-5-3-2, or 35-32). Players can do the same with their own hands. Later in the play, if unable to remember how many cards have been played in a suit, the player could reconstruct the play - and figure out how many times the suit has been led - by recalling a mental picture of the number of cards which the player and the dummy originally held in the suit. *The player could mentally review the bidding before playing to the first trick. If possible, the player could visualize a picture of each player's general hand pattern and high-card strength. Consider not just what the hidden hands actually bid, but also what they did not bid. When they bid, consider not just what they have, but also what they do not have.  Counting suits * Counting one suit * Counting two suits * Counting four suits = Counting trumps = As a declarer, an efficient way of counting the trump cards is: instead of counting the number of trump rounds and cards trumped in, count the number of trumps in the opponents' hands. Once the dummy hand appears, calculate the number of trumps which the opponents have, then reduce this number mentally as they are played from the opponents' hands. This means keeping track of one small number, and your own trumps do not enter the calculation. An even better way of counting trumps is to get familiar with common distribution patterns. For example, 5-3 and 4-4 are among the most common trump distributions on the declarer and dummy's hands. In cases, if an opponent shows out on the second trump round, then 5-3-1 or 4-4-1 is known, and the pattern 5-3-4-1 or 4-4-4-1 comes up automatically, and the other defender is known to have begun with four. * Counting as a defender * Counting HCP and winners See also  *Signal (bridge) *Rule of 11  References   External links * Count, count, count by Karen Walker * Counting by Robert Frick Category:Contract bridge card play ","title":"Card reading (bridge)"},{"id":"17365703","text":"Eurotower is a 40-storey, skyscraper in the Innenstadt district of Frankfurt, Germany. The building served as the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB) until 18 March 2015, at which point it was officially replaced by a new purpose-built building. The building is located at Willy-Brandt-Platz in Frankfurt's central business district, the Bankenviertel, opposite to the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt. Right next to the building is an underground U-Bahn station and an above-ground tram station.  History  The tower was designed by architect Richard Heil and was built between 1971 and 1977. The first main tenant was the Bank f√ºr Gemeinwirtschaft. The building was later used by the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the European Central Bank that was established in 1998. Until 2013, a club/restaurant called Living XXL was situated in the basement. Because of the limited space in the Eurotower the personnel of the ECB were also (up to March 2015) distributed between two other skyscrapers in the Bankenviertel, the Eurotheum and Neue Mainzer Stra√üe 32-36. This was considered less than optimal, so in the late 1990s the ECB began a process to have a new seat built on a site in the eastern part of Frankfurt. This was originally envisaged to bring together all the bank's personnel in one place, however with the increase in the ECB's responsibilities with the EU Single Supervisory Mechanism, the ECB will retain its presence in the Eurotower after its refurbishment. Construction of the new tower started in 2008 and was completed in late 2014. In November of that year bank personnel started to transfer from the Eurotower to their new offices at the Seat. Between 2015 and 2016 renovation had been carried out in the building. Tower was reopened in March, 2016.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecb-re-opens-its-revamped-old-hq- without-fanfare-2016-04-04 See also * European Central Bank * Seat of the European Central Bank * List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt * List of tallest buildings in Germany * List of tallest buildings in the European Union * Institutional seats of the European Union References External links Category:Government buildings completed in 1977 Category:Skyscrapers in Frankfurt Category:Bankenviertel Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Germany Category:Buildings and structures of the European Union Category:Office buildings completed in 1977 Category:European Central Bank ","title":"Eurotower (Frankfurt am Main)"},{"id":"17365718","text":"Brian Kierulf is a songwriter and producer from the United States.

History Kanayama Castle was built in 1469 by Iwamatsu Iezumi. In 1528, a retainer of the Iwamatsu Clan, Yokose Narishige (his family later changed their name to Yura), began ruling over it. The castle withstood sieges by Uesugi Kenshin in 1574, Takeda Katsuyori in 1580, and Satake Yoshishige in 1583. The H≈çj≈ç clan captured the lord of Tatebayashi Castle, Nagao Akinaga, and Yura Kunishige, the Kanayama castle was defended by his mother, Akai Teruko, at that time. The two brothers gave the H≈çj≈ç Kanayama Castle, under the condition that he be released. In 1590, as part of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's campaign against the H≈çj≈ç, Kanayama Castle was seized by Maeda Toshiie. Following this, the castle was abandoned and never used again.Kanayama Castle The castle's ruins (which have partly been restored) are currently maintained by the City of Ota. It was long believed that the tenshu (keep) of Kanayama Castle was moved to Inuyama Castle by Ishikawa Mitsuyoshi in 1559. This theory was disproved by archeological examinations undertaken during restoration works, which involved the dismantling of the castle's donjon, carried out between 1961 and 1965.

Description  The size of this juvenile Pacific gopher snake is shown by comparison with the hands holding it. Pacific gopher snake adults range in size from 3‚Äì7 feet (91‚Äì213 cm) in total length. However, most of the subspecies reach a length of 4‚Äì5 feet (122‚Äì152 cm). The hatchlings are relatively long, and they have been recorded at lengths upward of 20 inches (51 cm). The Pacific gopher snake has a base color ranging from yellow to dark brown and has a gray coloring on the sides of the body. It is a spotted snake, with the spots being dark brown. Usually there are 41 to 99 spots on the body, while the tail spots range from 14 to 33. The side of the body has 2 or 3 rows of alternating black and brown spots. A snake with keeled scales, and a narrow head that is wider than the neck, the Pacific gopher snake also displays a protruding rostral scale on the tip of the snout. The two most common base colors are straw and straw gray, though the species' color varies widely. The dorsal blotches, or saddles, are well-defined and generally dark to chocolate brown, though some specimens have had black blotches. The side blotches are often brown or gray. The back of the neck is dark brown. In many areas, such as Solano County, California, the snake can be found in a striped morph. The ventral side may be cream-colored to yellowish with dark spots. On the dorsal side, especially near the tail, there is often a reddish coloration.  Identification  As aforementioned, there are 2 to 3 rows of spots on the side of the Pacific gopher snake. However, the San Diego gopher snake (P. c. annectens) has 3 to 4 rows of smaller spots on its side. The Pacific gopher snake's saddle spots do not have the barren characteristic as those of the San Diego gopher snakes do. Also, the spots in the second row of spots are much larger on P.c. catenifer as compared to P.c. annectens. Finally, the Pacific gopher snake generally has more saddle spots than the San Diego gopher snake.  Behavior  The snake is diurnal, though sometimes active at dusk and nocturnal during warm weather. They prefer drier habitats such as meadows, fields and agricultural farmland, and are seldom found in dense forests. Like other gopher snakes, the Pacific gopher snake can produce a loud hiss when agitated or fearful. When threatened, this species will inflate its body, flatten its head, and vigorously shake its tail, which may produce a rattling sound if done in dry vegetation. However, gopher snakes are nonvenomous, generally good natured, and not harmful to humans. The Pacific gopher snake is carnivorous. Their diet consists of small mammals, notably pocket gophers; birds and their eggs; the occasional lizard and insect, and even bats. Life expectancy The Pacific gopher snake is observed to live twelve to fifteen years in the wild. The oldest known individual lived over thirty-three years in captivity. Reproduction They are an oviparous species in which eggs are laid from June to August and hatch in 2 to 2.5 months. In captive breeding, the snake goes through a winter brumation period to improve breeding success. The clutches average 12-14 eggs and hatch in the same time period as in the wild. Geographic range The Pacific gopher snake ranges up and down the West Coast of the United States, its range ending in the southern coast of California. Gopher snakes are rarely seen above 2000 feet and are most commonly seen adjacent to farms in semi-arid brushy areas. The Pacific gopher snake can also be found in southern British Columbia and Alberta, and in Mexico. Gallery Image:Pacific Gopher Snake.jpgA Pacific gopher snake about 3 feet long.

It is situated on the New England Highway at the Severn River in Severn parish, Gough County, New South Wales. The elevation is 985 metres. History In 1838 John Baker and several others left Sydney to seek land and setup stations on the Northern Tablelands. After the others selected their land Baker continued north to secure the lease of , which he called \\"Dareel Plains\\", later to become Dundee. By 1844 the property had been sold several times before Major Archibald Clunes Innes took it over that year. At one stage Innes was one of the wealthiest men in the Colony, but suffered heavily during the 1840s depression and was declared bankrupt in 1852. In 1845 the newly established Dundee flour mill was the first flour mill north of Aberdeen, New South Wales. Major Innes built the ‚ÄòGolden Fleece‚Äô Hotel at Dundee in 1847, to become one of the first three hotels built in New England. The large colonial style brick building was the first important building to be erected near the shallow river crossing. Cobb and Co coaches ran a coach service to Armidale, prior to the advent of the rail service. The Dundee Railway is 387 miles (705 km) north of Sydney and opened 1 September 1886 and closed 27 March 1976. The Public School opened in August 1853 and closed May 1974. Another school opened as Dundee Railway Station School in August 1891, changed to Dundee Rail 1940 and closed 1949. The Post Office opened 1 October 1851 and closed in 1974; a second post office opened as Dundee Railway Station 16 August 1885 and closed 1955. In 1989 the Severn River Rail Bridge, 6 km west-south-west of Dundee and 18 km north-north-east of Glen Innes on the Main North railway line, was listed on the Register of the National Estate. The bridge consists of a series of timber trusses which was considered a significant technical accomplishment. When completed it was the longest timber truss bridge in Australia. Little else remains of the village that once existed there, aside from the church, a sports ground and the cemetery. The surrounding district supports sheep and beef cattle grazing plus some tourism.

The movie premiered on March 11, 2009. With a budget of around ‚Ç¨5 million, it was one of the most expensive Serbian movie productions to date. Some of the funds have been donated by the governments of Serbia (‚Ç¨1.55 million) and Republika Srpska (‚Ç¨750,000) who deemed the movie to be of national importance. Kovaƒçeviƒá's script is based on his 1984 theater play that was staged to great success in Belgrade's Atelje 212 and Novi Sad's Serbian National Theatre. Plot The film starts with the Kingdom of Serbia, as part of the Balkan League, battling the remaining Ottoman forces during the First Balkan War in 1912 and ends with the outbreak of World War I in 1914; namely, the crucial Battle of Cer, first allied victory in World War I. It is largely set in and around a small village by the Sava river near Serbia's border with Austria-Hungary. The village is deeply divided between able-bodied men that are potential army recruits and the many disabled veterans from the previous Balkan Wars; there is bitter animosity between the two groups, who do not intermingle much with each other even though they live in the same village. The movie's central theme is a love triangle between the village gendarme ƒêorƒëe, his wife Katarina and the young disabled war veteran Gavrilo who was previously engaged to Katarina before he went to war and lost his arm in battle, and with the arm partly also his lust for life. Even though Katarina married ƒêorƒëe in the meantime, she still has affection for Gavrilo, which is a source of friction between the two. At the onset of World War I, all able-bodied men in the village are recruited for combat. Left in the village are only women, children and disabled veterans from previous Balkan wars. Rumours start circulating that the invalids in the village are trying to take advantage of the situation by making their moves on the women in the village - the wives and sisters of the recruited men. These rumours reach the villagers at the frontlines, and in order to prevent mutiny the army staff decides to recruit the invalids as well and send them to the front line.

The movie's production company was an ad hoc legal entity called \\"Sveti Georgije ubiva a≈ædahu\\" - a one-off company registered and established for the purposes of making this film. Listed as its founders and owners were the following businesses: Zillion Film (production company owned by Lazar Ristovski), Yodi Movie Craftsman (owned by Zoran Cvijanoviƒá and Milko Josifov), Delirium Film (owned by Srƒëan Dragojeviƒá), and Maslaƒçak Film (owned by Biljana Prvanoviƒá). Additional production entities involved were Oskar Film from Banja Luka and Camera from Bulgaria. Besides the governments of Serbia (under prime minister Ko≈°tunica and cultural minister Dragan Kojadinoviƒá) and Republika Srpska (under prime minister Milorad Dodik) that donated a total of ‚Ç¨2.25 million, the movie's additional funding came from Eurimages fund that contributed ‚Ç¨400,000, Serbian Ministry of Culture, and the Executive Council of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The movie had 92 shooting days (50 of them night shoots) throughout the summer and fall of 2007 on locations in Serbia, Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Bulgaria. The shooting began on 18 July 2007 and wrapped on 5 December 2007. For the shooting in Serbia, an entire village was built in early 20th century style in South Banat District near Deliblatska Pe≈°ƒçara with full and detailed interiors created by cinematographer Miljen \\"Kreka\\" Kljakoviƒá. In Republika Srpska, the shooting took place in Omarska near Prijedor where the Battle of Cer was recreated. =Controversy= Originally cast for the role of young war cripple Gavrilo was Sergej Trifunoviƒá. However, as the film was about to go into production, a row over creative issues erupted between him and Lazar Ristovski, one of the film's producers who also plays the role of ƒêorƒëe the gendarme. This resulted in Trifunoviƒá effectively being fired from the movie and young Milutin Milo≈°eviƒá cast instead for the role of Gavrilo. Towards the end of shooting, the movie's cinematographer Miljen \\"Kreka\\" Kljakoviƒá walked off the set, reportedly over not being paid in full the agreed upon amount in his contract. Reaction The movie provoked a reaction from the opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) that accused it of \\"falsifying facts\\". Dramaturgist Radoslav Pavloviƒá, an SNS member, complained about the historical liberties taken by the film's creators, namely the depiction of the crippled veterans being recruited for battle - an event of which there's no historical proof. Historian Predrag J. Markoviƒá listed the film as an example of \\"auto- chauvinism\\", a term he described as \\"the hatred of one's own people\\". Markoviƒá added: \\"Terrible damage has been inflicted with this project, which ate up enormous resources of both Serbia and Republika Srpska in order to portray Serbian soldiers as freakish monsters and Serb people as immoral scum. This may be legitimate under the licence of artistic freedom, but it's unfathomable that the state would financially support a film like that. It's another example that when it comes to us (the Serbs), the only lasting ideologies are stupidity and negligence\\". Critical reception =Serbia= Released in mid March 2009 in Serbia and Republika Srpska (March 11 in Belgrade, March 12 in Banja Luka, and March 13 in Ni≈°) to much media coverage, the movie received mostly lukewarm reviews. Many of the reviewers underscored the opinion that the finished product failed to live up to the hype that surrounded it. After two weeks of theatrical release, the film sold 67,032 admission tickets in Serbia. By the end of its theatrical run in Serbia, the film sold 125,000 admission tickets,Srƒëan Dragojeviƒá: 'Sveti Georgije ubiva a≈ædahu' nije srpski herojski film!; DnevniKulturni.info, 11 January 2010 grossing $325,265 in the country, all of which was far less than expected. =Other= Recent Western critical reviews have been a bit more positive. After seeing it at the 2009 Montreal World Film Festival, Variety's Dennis Harvey penned a lukewarm review, somewhat praising Dragojeviƒá for \\"directing the noisy, sprawling tale in colorful, confident fashion, at times recalling the rambunctious grotesquerie of Emir Kusturica's Underground (a more successful Kovaƒçeviƒá adaptation, also starring Ristovski)\\" while pointing out that the whole thing still \\"seems schematic rather than felt\\" and identifying the movie's biggest problem to be its central romance, which is \\"neither convincing nor appealing\\". Stephen Farber writing for Reuters, says, \\"As the film morphs into a penetrating anti-war drama, it becomes considerably more potent. Director Srdjan Dragojevic, who made Pretty Village, Pretty Flame in 1996, demonstrates undeniable talent. The battle scenes capture the chaos and brutality of trench warfare, and the finale builds a mournful power. Cinematography is rich, and the score adds to the movie's impact. Although it's easy to grow impatient during St. George's early scenes, the haunting conclusion stays with you.\\" The film was selected as the Serbian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. Notes * The movie St. George Shoots the Dragon is based on a highly acclaimed theatre play of the same name written in 1984 by Du≈°an Kovaƒçeviƒá, who also wrote the movie's screenplay. *Du≈°an Kovaƒçeviƒá claims that the movie is based on a true story that was allegedly told to him by his grandfather Cvetko Kovaƒçeviƒá, who, as a young boy at the onset of World War I, transported wounded and killed soldiers with an oxcart to a field hospital set up near the city of ≈†abac during the Battle of Cer. However, there is no historical proof for Kovaƒçeviƒá's claims that disabled people had been recruited and sent to the frontlines in Serbia during the First World War. * The working English title of the movie was a literal translation of the Serbian title; St. George Slays the Dragon. It was subsequently altered to reflect a scene where one character calls for Saint George to shoot at and sink an Austrian patrol boat on the Sava river. * Zoran Tuciƒá, storyboard artist of the film, is the notable Serbian and Yugoslav graphic novel author, architect and illustrator. TV miniseries Radio Television of Serbia will broadcast a six-part TV miniseries based on the movie after the movie premiere, as part of marking the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I.

He was tasked on several occasions with fortifying strategically important areas and also reconstruction, including all Black Sea ports during and after World War II. He served primarily on military engineering and defense strategy posts, including being the Deputy Minister of Defence and would play a major role in the structural development of the Soviet armed forces and strategic missile forces during the Cold War era. An avenue in Georgia's capital Tbilisi and a street in the city of Sevastopol have been named after Marshal Gelovani.http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234 Early life Gelovani was born on November 27, 1915, in the village Spatagori of the Tsageri District in Georgia. The boy was not yet six years old when his father, known in the Caucasus as Viktor Gelovani the engineer, died of typhoid fever. The orphan had to learn to live and grow up the hard way. But instead of breaking the young man, it only contributed in steeling his character.http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234 In 1936 after graduating from the Tbilisi Industrial Institute, he started his career as engineer. After only three years his life took a radical change. Gelovani joined the Soviet Army as the army was in need of competent experts, since it became clearer that a war would be the case soon or later. The young engineer quickly found his place in the armed forces and rose through its ranks.http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234 Military career As a military technician of 1st rank, he began his activities with the Black Sea Fleet and got soon appointed to chief engineer for constructions. The Great Patriotic War found him quickly when he led a small task force of engineers to construct several artillery positions and place artillery batteries on them under heaviest enemy shelling and impossible conditions. The 152 mm guns would play a great role during the Battle of Perekop which was part of the Crimean Offensive. For completing this mission Gelovani received his first and personally most memorable award, the Order of the Red Star. Many more would follow. In the postwar years, Archil Gelovani's work was accociated mainly to Reconstruction, particularly coastal areas of the Black Sea. Thus in 1953 he was appointed Chief of Military Infrastructure in the port city of Sevastopol, which was heavily damaged during the war. The reconstruction of Sevastopol was given high importance as it would serve as the main base of the Black Fleet and was strictly observed by Moscow. Due to his huge success and numerous other efforts in the area, Gelovani would be later granted the title of 'Honorary Citizen and Hero of Sevastopol' in 1976. One of Sevastopols streets was also named after him. From 1956 to 1959 Gelovani performed construction works while being second in command of the Black Sea Fleet. Later on the same year, he got appointed to deputy commander of the Soviet Navy Construction Buro with the rank of Major-General.http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234 The success of military builder Archil Gelovani evaluated which made him receive a position as Chief Engineer of the Strategic Missile Troops. It was then in 1962, when a new branch in the armed forces celebrated its second year. The Engineering forces had to complete a gigant task which was to build missile systems and launchers in time and quickly put them on alert. In 1968 Gelovani received the Lenin Prize for the development and implementation of special military facilities. A few years later he would also receive the State Prize in accordance to the successful emplacement and in time readiness of all strategic missiles. In 1974 the prince was appointed to Deputy Minister of Defence for Construction and Quartering of Troops. A huge map in his office covered symbols of construction projects. In 1977 for serving as engineer, organizer and guide for the construction of countless military and also civilian infrastructure, Colonel General Archil V Gelovani was awarded the title Chief Marshal of Engineering Troops.http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234 Death As a result of an unknown disease, Marshal Prince Archil Gelovali died on August 19, 1978, in Moscow. In the hospital he gave a short interview to one of the military magazines:http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234 He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

The basic premise of the game was that in the 1990s violence was spreading across the globe, brought forth by a group of terrorists. The protagonists, John Jackson and Jack Thomas, are sent into battle to eradicate all threats.http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/double-hawk Double Hawk has been called Sega's version of Cabal (which was ported to the rival Nintendo Entertainment System the same year). Gameplay The game consists of five missions, each with four levels ending in a boss fight. Throughout the game the player must eliminate various enemies including foot soldiers, armed vehicles, and helicopters using multiple guns and ordnance weapons. The player must survive the first 3 stages of every mission within a time limit, and while the 4th \\"boss\\" fight of every mission is also timed, that mission will not end until all enemy units have been eliminated. A unique element that features in this game is that in co-op gameplay, if a player gets hit 3 times and dies, he or she will automatically re-spawn and take a hit off their co-op partner, provided their partner is not down to their last hit. Various upgrades can be found in each level to facilitate game play. These upgrades would be in the form of colored boxes that fall from enemies that have been taken down. They include: * Red [S] - Shooting - for a limited time, the player has a larger target range and faster shooting upgrades, which is useful for taking down air-based attacks from helicopters and planes * Navy [R] - Rapid Fire - for a limited time, the player has the rapid fire ability with his gun, which is useful for taking down ground-based attacks from tanks and heavy machinery. * Light blue [B] - Bombs - the player receives 10 hand bombs (grenades) to use on the enemy. The player is limited to carry a maximum of 99 grenades. * Brown [F] - Faster - for the duration of the rest of that particular stage, the player is able to move around and aim his gun faster, useful for dodging bullets. None of these upgrades remain with the player if he or she continues from a gameover.

FST, an echelon-five command since 2006, is tasked with performing an unparalleled function within the U.S. Navy. The command enables combatant commanders with access in the littoral regions through expeditionary hydrography. When forces are armed with detailed descriptions of the environmental conditions they could face, operations have a greater chance of being safely and efficiently executed. FST gathers the needed information via timely, self-contained hydrographic surveys in response to combatant commanders‚Äô requests. These requests frequently are for areas where Navy operations will take place or where charting accuracy is uncertain. FST members (both civilian and military) can quickly deploy to areas around the world outfitted with equipment to perform surveys from various boats of opportunity. Because of these unique capabilities, civilian and military members of FST have deployed to areas of combat like the Middle East to perform near-shore surveys to collect data which aids in the safe navigation of U.S. forces and supplies traversing the area. FST members have also played significant roles in charting areas affected by natural disasters such as the south Asia tsunami of 2004 and hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf of Mexico. Command personnel offer a unique blend of military and civilian knowledge and experience. Enlisted sailors routinely qualify as level two military hydrographers, certifying their skills. In addition to their strong backgrounds in math, science and engineering, officers and civilians frequently obtain master‚Äôs degrees in hydrographic science through an ongoing program with The University of Southern Mississippi and are also recognized by the International Hydrographic Office as Category A hydrographers.

Cleon made a reputation for himself with robbery and marauding warfare in and around Olympus, long occupying the fortress called by ancient geographers Callydium (Strabo) or Calydnium (Eustathius). He at first courted the favour of Mark Antony, and was awarded a good deal of land in exchange. In 40 BC Cleon's forces harried an invading body of Parthians led by Quintus Labienus. Around the time of the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Cleon switched sides to that of Octavian. In exchange for services rendered in the wars against Mark Antony, Octavian appointed Cleon the priest of the goddess Bellona in the temple-state of Comana and sovereign, therefore, of the surrounding country. Cleon added what he had been given by Octavian to what he had received from Mark Antony and styled himself a dynast. Under Octavian he also founded the city of Juliopolis out of the town of his birth, Gordiucome. Strabo mentions that Cleon was a priest of Jupiter Abrettenus and ruler of Morene, a region of Mysia noticed by no other writer. Cleon's rule was unsuccessful and exceedingly brief; he died only one month after his appointment. In contemporary accounts, it was written that Cleon died because he ignored a taboo against eating pork in the temple precinct of Bellona. It is sometimes recorded that Cleon succeeded Lycomedes as ruler of Comana after the very brief reign of Medeius of Comana. Strabo suggests that Medeius and Cleon are different names for the same person, the former being the Greek name, the latter the native one.Strabo, Geographica 574, xii, 8, 8-9 Cleon was in any case succeeded by Dyteutus.

The first two brigades landed at Marseilles on 26 September 1914, but there were further delays while the troops were re-armed with the latest pattern rifle, and the supply train could be improvised, using tradesmen's vans procured locally.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, p. 92, Note 1. The 3rd Lahore Divisional Area was formed in late 1914 to take over the garrison duties of the 3rd Division when it left for France. The 3rd Lahore Divisional Area was disbanded in May 1917, the responsibilities of the area being taken over by the 16th Division. Order of Battle October 1914Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, Appendix 1.F.W.

The degree to which the division was broken up can be gauged by the 29 October entry in the diary kept by the Indian corps' commander, Lt-Gen Sir James Willcocks: :\\"Where is my Lahore Division? Sirhind Brigade detained in Egypt. Ferozepore Brigade: somewhere in the north, split up into three or four bits.

Coincidentally, on the same day, the Secretary of State for India, Austen Chamberlain, told the Viceroy of India that he was anxious for the Indian infantry to be withdrawn from France before they had to endure another winter. The system for supplying drafts had broken down and the Indian battalions were becoming very weak after the heavy casualties they had suffered. Although the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, objected to their withdrawal from the Western Front, orders were issued on 31 October for the two divisions of Indian Corps (3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Division) to embark at Marseilles for Mesopotamia. They were to leave behind their attached Territorial Force and Special Reserve battalions, and the three RFA brigades of 18-pounder guns of 3rd (Lahore) Division.Edmonds & Wynne, 1915, Vol II, pp. 402‚Äì3. The two divisions were relieved in the front line on 6 November and were due at Basra in December, but their departure from Marseilles was delayed because of fear of submarine attack.Moberly, Vol II. 3rd (Lahore) Division finally arrived in Mesopotamia in April 1916 and joined Tigris Corps, too late to relieve 6th (Poona) Division at Kut-al-Amara. =Palestine= After the fall of Baghdad, the Palestine Campaign was given priority over Mesopotamia, and in March 1918 the division was transferred to Egypt to join Sir Edmund Allenby's Egyptian Expeditionary Force until the end of the war.Moberly, Vol IV.

A number of reviewers point out that most of the scientists profiled in the book don‚Äôt actually deny climate change. These reviewers characterize the book as containing selective quotes of scientists' disagreements on the details of climate change in order to present the impression that there is no consensus on climate change. In fact, despite the title, they report that Solomon acknowledges in the book that \\"I ‚Ä¶ noticed something striking about my growing cast of deniers.

It was a continuation of the earlier ESPN program Pro Wrestling USA, the co-operative venture between the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and several National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) affiliates (most notably Jim Crockett Promotions). On February 26, 2008, ESPN ClassicAWA on ESPN Classic began reairing AWA Championship Wrestling episodes. Episodes are available on the WWE Network. Overview In September 1985, the AWA began airing weekly programming on ESPN, giving the promotion the national exposure already enjoyed by the World Wrestling Federation (on USA Network) and the NWA's Georgia/World Championship Wrestling (on TBS). However, weekly AWA shows were not treated with any priority by the cable network, sometimes being delayed, preempted by live programming, or suffering from occasional changes in time slot, making it difficult for fans to tune in on a regular basis. Following the disastrous Team Challenge Series,AWA #7 Page #2AWA Team Challenge Series: A Great Federation Dies in a Turkey of a Match the AWA lost its contract with ESPN and became virtually inactive by late 1990. =Taping locations= For many years, the AWA held their television tapings in their home base of Minneapolis, Minnesota (for their syndicated All-Star Wrestling program) at the WTCN television studios. However, in early 1985, AWA promoter Verne Gagne made the decision to hold some television tapings at the Tropicana Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. When Gagne inked the deal with ESPN later that same year, he along with the ESPN management felt that another location for the AWA television tapings was necessary. Ultimately, Gagne and ESPN settled on the Showboat Sports Pavilion in Las Vegas, Nevada. Both the WWF on the USA Network and the NWA on TBS were able to draw more crowds than the AWA's ESPN program.Pile-driving, gut- busting, back-breaking theater - Minnesota Daily The ESPN tapings in Las Vegas often took place in front of small, silent crowds.AWA #5 Page #2 In 1989, they taped from the Rochester, MN Civic Center until their final taping on August 11, 1990. =Commentators= Rod Trongard's voice was featured on the AWA's weekly ESPN broadcasts, reaching millions of homes around the world. His signature phrase was \\"From coast to coast, continent to continent, and border to border\\". During broadcasts, he often included city names in the phrase, signifying the broad reach of wrestling and the AWA's broadcasts at the time. Trongard called matches alongside fellow commentators Lord James Blears and Lee Marshall.

After being discharged from the RIAF, he returned to Lahore, but moved to Delhi in 1940 where he set up a studio, which later expanded into a full-fledged agency, in the Mori Gate district of Old Delhi. For a few years previously, he had been following Mahatma Gandhi in his travels around India in a third-class train compartment; that experience permitted him to gain insider status that meant that he was permitted to record many crucial events of and major participants in the independence movement, including Jinnah, Nehru and Patel. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Jawaharlal Nehru walk to a Congress meeting while Sardar Patel is pulled alongside in a rickshaw. Roy's access provided him with ample opportunities for informal photographs. Among his most iconic photographs are one of Jinnah arguing with Gandhi on the verandah of his bungalow; normally credited to the Hulton-Getty archive, it has recently been established that it was one of many such taken by Roy. Others include a similarly well-known photograph of Nehru and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan walking as AICC representatives to meet the Cabinet Mission while a rickshaw carrying Patel travels alongside. A photograph of Nehru and Patel listening intently to Gandhi at a Congress Working Committee meeting was made into a commemorative stamp after Patel's death in 1950; it won a silver plaque from Amrita Bazar Patrika as the best news photograph of the year. After independence in 1947, Roy continued to photograph Nehru in particular, taking several photographs of the Nehru-Gandhi family and one of Nehru sitting pensively in cricket flannels, his chin resting on his bat. Also in the 1950s, he was one of the first to document the trek by pilgrims to the cave at Amarnath in Kashmir.\\"Le p√©lerinage de la grotte d'Amarnath au Cachemire\\", Sciences et voyages, New third series: 169: January 1960. In 1958 he packed up his studio and set out on a trip around the world. For three years he took almost continuous photographs, visiting more than thirty countries, and every month mailing the previous month's negatives back to his office in India. When he returned in 1961, he discovered to his horror that all the packages had been stolen. For years thereafter he would spend weekends driving around garbage dumps in Delhi looking for the lost negatives. He died in New Delhi in 1984, working till the end; at the time of his death from cancer he was working on the negatives of the Seventh Non-Aligned Movement Conference. He left his surviving photographic negatives and archives to his nephew. This collection is in the process of being scanned and organised, and reportedly contains images exhaustively chronicling most major incidents of the period, including the Cripps Mission and the INA trials; after independence, they include a series documenting the development of the Bhakra-Nangal dam and photographs from the front of the Sino-Indian War, which he organised by day. Exhibitions and publications The India Photo Archive Foundation displays pictures at its museum by Kulwant Roy and has organised exhibitions in collaboration with others of his works.

He fought as few as a dozen duels, a derisory number compared to the great duellists of his day. One of the twelve was against his own cousin, Bagenal Harvey. Harvey fired first, but missed, to Bagenal's delight. \\"You damn you villain? Do you know you had like to kill your own godfather? Go back to Dunleckney, you dog, and have a good breakfast ready for us. I only wanted to see if you were stout.\\" A number of other anecdotes of Bagenal's wildness and eccentricity exist online. Bagenal was lame, and therefore, when fighting had to lean against a tombstone. He represented Enniscorthy in the Irish House of Commons from 1761 to 1768. He sat then as Member of Parliament (MP) for Carlow County between 1768 and 1776 and again between 1778 and 1783. By his wife Maria he had three children; he had at least one illegitimate child, Sarah.

Beacon Mill or New Mill is a grade II listed smock mill at Rottingdean, Sussex, England which has been restored as a seamark. History Beacon Mill, was built in 1802. There are records of an earlier mill on the site, thought to have been a post mill. During the digging of the foundations, a human skeleton was found. The mill was working until 1881 and by 1890 was in such bad condition that demolition was considered. In 1905, the Marquis of Abergavenny had the mill repaired, but she was derelict again by the early 1920s. It was 1935 before she was restored again, the millwrighting being done by Neve's of Heathfield and new sails were made by Holman's, the Canterbury millwrights. In 1969, the mill was leaning to the north east, and Hole's, the Burgess Hill millwrights erected a steel frame inside the smock to support the mill, and fitted new sails. The steel framing was extended into the cap in 1974 Description Beacon Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a single- storey brick base. It has a Kentish-style cap, and four Patent sails.

Principle of operation  The jiggle pump consists of a chamber, in line with the end of the pipe that sits in the liquid to be moved. The chamber is somewhat wider than the pipe, and narrows to approximately the pipe diameter at both ends. One end attaches to the pipe, the other end is open to the liquid. Within the chamber is a sphere, denser than the liquid to be pumped, small enough to move freely within the chamber but large enough to not be able to leave the chamber.Instructions for building a jiggle syphon To begin with, gravity holds the sphere at the bottom, open, end of the chamber, although hydrostatic pressure will force the liquid up and around the sphere upon immersion. When the pipe is vigorously shaken up and down, the sphere moves upwards, lifting some liquid in the pipe; then when it falls down again, the increased hydrostatic pressure within the pipe (which now has a higher head of fluid in it than the surrounding container) pushes the sphere down and prevents the liquid flowing back. Repeated \\"jigglings\\" lift the fluid up the pipe until it reaches the highest point in the pipe, whereupon gravity causes it to start to flow down the other side, and the syphon action will \\"suck\\" the liquid through the system. This causes the pressure in the pipe to drop below the hydrostatic pressure in the container, so the sphere is lifted upwards, allowing the liquid to flow.

Overview The number of rail paths available on a given railway line depends on a number of factors. The number of tracks and the type of signalling, specifically the number of blocks, are limits set by the actual infrastructure. A variable factor is the speed difference between trains. Optimal capacity is achieved when all trains run at the same speed. When that is not the case, faster trains will eventually catch up to slower trains, so trains have to be spaced much further apart to avoid interference. Applications Usually, train operators apply for train paths over a given period several months before the start of the period. After a deadline has passed, the rail infrastructure company uses all applications to create the working timetable. A number of rail infrastructure companies have defined different classes of train paths. More expensive classes are treated with priority during timetable construction and operation. Delayed trains If a train is delayed beyond a certain tolerance, it will \\"fall out\\" of its allocated train path. On congested lines, this will result in additional delays, as such a train is taken to passing sidings whenever that is necessary to let other trains pass.  Graphs  Train paths are usually shown on a time-distance graph, where time is shown horizontally, and distance (including a representation of the track layout) is shown vertically.

Ferris, 2010 Elizabeth's half-sister by their father's second marriage was Grace Smith, wife of the heroic Civil War Royalist commander Sir Bevil Grenville (1596-1643) of Bideford in Devon and Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall, killed in action at the Battle of Lansdowne (1643) and mother of John Grenville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628‚Äì1701), who greatly assisted his half-first cousin George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608‚Äì1670) in effecting the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. Career In 1629 he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford and graduated B.A. on 3 March 1630-1, and M.A. on 30 October 1633.Bradley, Emily Tennyson, biography of \\"Monck, Nicholas\\", published in Dictionary of National Biography, Vol.38, 1894, London Instead of entering the army like his two surviving elder brothers, he took holy orders, as was usual for younger sons of the gentry. From 1640 he served as Rector of Langtree, a parish near Potheridge, and was given the Rectory of Kilkhampton in Cornwall by his half-cousin Sir John Grenville700 Years of the Rectors and Patrons of Langtree, with Notes on the Church (Langtree Church visitor guide ), p.3 (later 1st Earl of Bath). After 1646 he obtained the small rectory of Plymtree in Devon, having in 1642 married the daughter of the then rector, whose family held the advowson, and this was confirmed to him by General Monck's influence with Cromwell. During the Civil War his sympathies certainly leaned to the royalist side, and in 1653 he was presented by his kinsman, Sir John Granville (later 1st Earl of Bath), to the valuable living of Kilhampton in Cornwall, worth about ¬£260 a year.Bradley After Cromwell's death Grenville sent 'the honest clergyman' up to London, where he received through George Monck's brother-in-law, Thomas Clarges, instructions to go to Scotland and ascertain his brother's intentions. Nicholas therefore sailed for Edinburgh, in August 1659, on the ostensible errand of arranging a marriage for one of his daughters. He found the general engaged with a council of officers, but confided his mission to the general's chaplain, John Price, who was in the confidence of the royalist party. From Price, Monck received every encouragement. The next day the brothers met, and various accounts are given of their interview, but all agree that the general refused to commit himself as to his future conduct.Bradley After the Restoration, Nicholas was nominated by King Charles II as Provost of Eton College, on the recommendation of Granville. There was no pretence of election on the part of the Fellows of Eton College, who much incensed by the king's arbitrary proceeding, refused to make an entry of the appointment in the College register. A copy of the royal letter, dated 7 July 1660, nominating Monck is extant in Eton's College Library. Most of the puritan fellows resigned or were ejected, and 'new regulations were drawn up by the new provost and fellows, the former's stipend being fixed at ¬£500 a year, besides 'wood, capons, 20 dozen of candles, and 20 loads of hay.' On 1 August 1660 Nicholas was created Doctor of Divinity at Oxford University, and on 1 December 1660, he was appointed by the king as Bishop of Hereford, a see which had been vacant for fourteen years. He was to hold his provostship in addition for two years. He was consecrated on 6 January 1660-1 in Westminster Abbey by the Archbishop of York, but lived to enjoy his new dignity only for eleven months.Bradley Marriage and children In 1642 he married Susannah Payne, a daughter of Rev. Thomas Payne, Rector of Plymtree in Devon, and widow of Christopher Trosse. By his wife he had children as follows: *Nicholas Monck, son and heir apparent, who died young; *Mary Monck, co-heiress, who married Arthur Fairwell of Westminster, Engraving of Nicholas Monck and the Rawlinson Family, by Joseph Nutting, early 18th century *Elizabeth Monck, co-heiress, who married Curwen Rawlinson of Carke Hall, Cartmell, Lancashire. Her monument, erected by her son the antiquary Christopher Rawlinson (1677‚Äì1733), survives in St. Mary's Church, Cartmell, and describes her father Nicholas Monck as \\"a great assistant in the Restoration to his brother\\". Death and burial He died on 17 December 1661, aged 51, at his lodgings in Old Palace Yard, Palace of Westminster, and was buried on the 20th in Westminster Abbey, his brother the Duke of Albemarle having attended the funeral as chief mourner.Bradley In 1723 his grandson Christopher Rawlinson erected in his memory a pyramidical monument in black and white marble in St. Edmund's Chapel, Westminster Abbey.Bradley References Sources *Bradley, Emily Tennyson, biography of \\"Monck, Nicholas\\", published in Dictionary of National Biography, Vol.38, 1894, London * - Category:Bishops of Hereford Category:17th-century Anglican bishops Category:1610 births Category:1661 deaths ","title":"Nicholas Monck"},{"id":"17366841","text":"Sound The Retreat is Volume VII of the novel sequence Alms for Oblivion by Simon Raven, published in 1971. It was the seventh novel to be published in The Alms for Oblivion sequence though it is the second novel chronologically. The story takes place in India from November 1945 to June 1946. Plot summary The story takes place between November 1945 and June 1946 in British India. Peter Morrison and his cadet comrades arrive in Bangalore for military service and are informed that they will have an Indian commander. The cadet Alister Mortleman disapproves strongly. During a visit with Captain Detterling to Ley Wong's restaurant, the Earl of Muscateer, the son of Detterling‚Äôs cousin Lord Canteloupe, gets food poisoning and later dies of jaundice. The cadets meet their Indian commander, Gilzai Khan, and (except for Mortleman) take a liking to him. Khan starts a sexual relationship with the cadet Barry Strange. Khan shows strong feelings during Muscateer's funeral, and later during some heavy drinking at Ley Wong‚Äôs is rebuked by Mortleman. Khan arranges an unusual duel in which Mortleman will have the advantage of youth and Khan that of experience: the men will demonstrate their sexual endurance with Ley Wong's waitresses, and the one who displays the highest number of ejaculations will win. Mortleman beats Khan by 3 ‚Äì 2. Shortly after, Peter Morrison starts a relation with a prostitute, Margaret Rose Engineer. Riots and unrest are breaking out all over India and Khan, a non religious Muslim, predicts bloodbaths between the Hindus and Muslims when the British leave. Morrison is blackmailed by Margaret Rose who says that he promised her marriage, and would have to resign his commission. Khan saves him by planting false evidence that she‚Äôs been forging ID cards at her home, and the charge against Morrison is dropped. Shortly after that Khan is removed from his command because of his positive attitude to British rule. An emotional farewell dinner for Khan is held at Ley Wong‚Äôs. Murphy, a cadet held back in hospital for a while, is rapidly promoted to captain by chance. Morrison, Mortleman and Strange are posted to Berhampore. When they arrive they are informed of Khan's resignation from the army without any explanation. Morrison is visited by Murphy, now working for the viceroy, who explains that Khan left the army to become a political agitator. Khan wants the British to remain in India to prevent the Hindus and Muslims from slaughtering each other. Murphy orders Morrison to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the affair, i.e. kill Khan. Shortly thereafter, Khan also visits Morrison, reveals that his group will block the local railway and asks Morrison and his friends to stay away if they can. Morrison tells Khan about his own orders, and they part on friendly terms. Very soon, Morrison, Strange and Mortleman face Khan during the action against the railway. Morrison is trying to arrest Khan but Strange and Khan have a quarrel, Strange stabs Khan with a sabre who dies congratulating Morrison on contriving his death. The men are devastated but are hailed as heroes and cleared of any charges. As they return to England they are given news that Murphy has been killed by a car bomb.

ADN decomposes under heat to leave only nitrogen, oxygen, and water. The ions are the ammonium ion NH4+ and the dinitramide N(NO2)2‚àí. It makes an excellent solid rocket oxidizer with a slightly higher specific impulse than ammonium perchlorate and more importantly, does not leave corrosive hydrogen chloride fumes. This property is also of military interest because halogen free smoke is harder to detect. It decomposes into low molecular mass gases so it contributes to higher performance without creating excessive temperatures if used in gun or rocket propellants. The salt is prone to detonation under high temperatures and shock more so than the perchlorate. The EURENCO Bofors company produced LMP-103S as a 1-to-1 substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% ammonium dinitramide, NH4N(NO2)2, in 35% water solution of methanol and ammonia. LMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density than hydrazine monopropellant. Additionally, hydrazine is highly toxic and carcinogenic, while LMP-103S is only moderately toxic. LMP-103S is UN Class 1.4S allowing for transport on commercial aircraft, and was demonstrated on the Prisma satellite in 2010. Special handling is not required. LMP-103S could replace hydrazine as the most commonly used monopropellant.Swedish Space Corporation Group, Monopropellant LMP-103S, 2011, www.ecap.se The ADN-based monopropellant FLP-106 is reported to have improved properties relative to LMP-103S, including higher performance (ISP of 259 s vs. 252 s) and density (1.362 g/cm3 vs. 1.240 g/cm3).  History  Ammonium dinitramide was invented in 1971 in Zelinskiy Institute of Organic Chemistry in the USSR. Initially all information related to this compound was classified because of its use as a rocket propellant, particularly in Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles. In 1989 ammonium dinitramide was independently synthesized at SRI International. SRI obtained US and international patents for ADN in the mid-1990s, at which time scientists from the former Soviet Union revealed they had discovered ADN 18 years earlier.  Preparation  There are at least 20 different synthesis routes that produce Ammonium dinitramide In the laboratory ammonium dinitramide, can be prepared by nitration of sulfamic acid or its salt under low temperatures. KO3S-NH2 + 2HNO3 W KHSO4 + NH4N(NO2)2 + H2O The process is performed under red light, since the compound is decomposed by higher energy photons. The details of the synthesis remain classified. Other sources report ammonium synthesis from ammonium nitrate, anhydrous nitric acid, and fuming sulfuric acid containing 20% free sulfur trioxide. A base other than ammonia must be added before the acid dinitramide decomposes. The final product is obtained by fractional crystallization. Another synthesis known as the urethane synthesis method requires four synthesis steps and results in a yield of up to 60 %. The processing method is not difficult and the amount of waste produced is relatively low. The urethane can be cleaned and recycled within the process.

The club was one of the founding members of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, finishing 2nd once and 3rd four times before defecting to the National Premier League ahead of the 2017 season. Their most successful season came in 2009‚Äì10, when they were runners-up in the Grand Final, losing 5‚Äì0 to Hekari United. The team finished as runners-up in the 2018 National Premier League season, losing in the Grand Final 4‚Äì3 to Erema FC.  History  = Foundation and early years = The club was founded sometime in the 1970s, but the first record of them playing competitively is from July 1998, when the club took part in the Papua New Guinea National Club Championship. The club were drawn into Pool B, and successfully qualified for the semi- finals. They defeated Guria Lahi 1‚Äì0 in the semi-final before losing to University in the final. The following year, the club entered the 1999 Lae Regional Championship, finishing fourth in regular season table. However, during their playoff match against Huon Chemical Wests, the side walked off with the score at 2‚Äì2. The match was awarded to HC Wests, and the club were dropped to fifth place. In 2000, the club returned to the Lae Regional Championship, finishing in the top two and reaching the Grand Final. They kicked-off against Poro SC on 25 November 2000, but the match was abandoned in the first half, and a replay was scheduled for the following day. The replay finished 1‚Äì1, with Poro winning 4‚Äì3 on penalties to claim the title. In October 2001, the side took part in the National Club Championship after a two-year absence, before losing in the quarter-finals to Rapatona FC. On 24 November 2001, after finishing the regular season top of the table, the side won the Grand Final of the Lae Regional Championship, defeating Goro FC 2‚Äì1. The side took part in the 2002 National Club Championship. They were drawn into Pool B but missed out on the semi-finals. Later that year, the side finished top of the 2002 Lae Regional Championship, but failed to make the knockout final, eventually finishing third. The following year, they took part in the National Club Championship again, with similar results to the previous season. In the 2003 Lae Regional Championship, they topped the regular season table and progressed to the final, but the result against HC Wests is unknown. From May‚ÄìAugust 2004, the side took part in the newly-formed Lae‚ÄìLahi Super League, although they appear to have pulled out midway through the competition. From 7‚Äì10 October 2004, the side again took part in the National Club Championship alongside 28 other teams. The side failed to make it out of the group stages again. In November, the side confirmed their qualification to the playoffs of the 2004 Lae Regional Championship, but they were beaten by Tarangau Warders and Huon Chemical Wests and finished 3rd overall. In 2005, the side took part in the Lae Regional Championships once again. They finished top of the eleven-team league and progressed through the playoffs to the final, where they defeated Huon Chemical Wests 2‚Äì1. They qualified for the 2006 National Club Championship as a result, and came third. = National Soccer League participation = The side was one of the teams that took part in the inaugural National Soccer League season. The side competed against four other clubs and finished second in the regular season table, qualifying for the playoffs. Meanwhile, the side finished 4th in the 2006 Lae Regional Championship. The side's NSL semi-final against Gelle Hills was due to be played on 18 November 2006, but at 0‚Äì0 was abandoned due to fading light. The replay saw Morobe slip to a 0‚Äì3 deficit, but the side were able to get back into the game before eventually losing 6‚Äì5 after extra time. The side proceeded to secure third place, defeating Madang Flying Fox 4‚Äì0 in the third- place match. Morobe returned for the 2007‚Äì08 season as one of seven clubs. They started the season strongly, defeating champions Hekari United 3‚Äì0 in the opening match before another 3‚Äì0 victory over Rapatona saw them enjoy an early league lead. In the 2007 Lae Regional Championship, the side secured third place, missing out on the final after a defeat to Poro SC. By March 2008, they had secured third place in the NSL table, once again qualifying for the playoffs. They faced champions Hekari in the semi-finals, going down 3‚Äì1 before again clinching third place with a 3‚Äì1 victory over Rapatona in the third-place playoff. = Gigira Laitepo sponsorship = Ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season, the club received sponsorship from Gigira Laitepo, a daughter company of Hides Gas Development Company. The partnership forced another name change for the club, which would last six years. The side once again finished third in the Lae Regional Championship, before the club's least successful National Soccer League campaign to date. Despite going unbeaten in their first three games, the side finished 6th out of 8 sides in the league table, failing to qualify for the playoffs for the first time. The following season they returned to form, securing their top four finish on the final day of the season with a 2‚Äì2 draw against University Inter. In the semi-final, the club recorded a narrow 1‚Äì0 victory over Rapatona to become the first club outside Port Moresby to reach the Grand Final. However, they succumbed 5‚Äì0 to reigning champions Hekari in the final. The side also completed their last Lae Regional Championship, finishing third for the third consecutive season. The 2010‚Äì11 season was the worst to date for the club. Following a 6‚Äì2 defeat to champions Hekari on the opening day of the season, the side struggled to find any sort of form, and only registered their first win in the fifth round of matches, defeating Besta PNG United 3‚Äì2 on 27 November 2010. This would prove to be their only victory in the season, and they finished bottom of the league. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, the side relocated from Lae to the Central region, in order to attract players and fans from that region, and were renamed Gigira Laitepo Central Coast FC. The move initially went well, with the side leading the table at the end of November 2011, and eventually finishing in 4th place, enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, for unknown reasons, their playoff place was taken by Tukoko University, who finished 5th. The following year saw the side return to their roots, returning to Lae and reverting to their previous name, Gigira Laitepo Morobe FC. However, in December 2012, there was speculation that the side may not be able to compete in the 2013 season due to lack of additional sponsorship and the removal of their association president. However, on 17 January 2013, it was confirmed that the side would be taking part in the competition. The side finished fourth in the regular season table, qualifying for the playoffs, where they faced champions Hekari in the semi-finals. The side went down 3‚Äì0 before being beaten 3‚Äì2 by Besta PNG United in the third-place playoff. The side continued in the league for the 2014 season, winning their opening match 4‚Äì0 against newcomers Lae FC thanks to a hat-trick from Jamal Seeto. They finished 4th in the league table, but were once again beaten by Hekari United in the playoff semi-finals, before beating Oro FC in the third-place playoff, securing their third third-placed finish. = Welgris sponsorship and split from NSL = In September 2014, the future of the club was put in doubt after Gigira Laitepo withdrew their sponsorship. In January, it was confirmed that the side would not be taking part in the upcoming season for the first time in the club's history, with many of their players choosing to move to Lae City Dwellers ahead of the season kick-off. The side returned ahead of the 2015‚Äì16 season, being drawn in the Northern Conference and later picking up sponsorship from Welgris Fuel Distributors. They finished second behind Lae City Dwellers in the Northern Conference, securing qualification for the playoffs, which that season took the form of a four-team group. With just one win from six matches, the side finished third in the table, missing out on qualification for the Grand Final. On 29 December 2016, the side revealed they were among the 12 sides breaking away from the National Soccer League to form a new association, the Football Federation Papua New Guinea (FFPNG). In February 2017, it was revealed that the side would be joining the newly-launched National Premier League, and taking part in the Northern Conference. Despite being the only former-NSL side in the Northern Conference, the team were unable to qualify for the playoffs, only finishing third in the conference table. The side returned for the 2018 season as one of four teams in the Northern Conference. In a three-day event, Morobe won two games and drew the third, qualifying for the Grand Final. They faced Erema FC, going down 4‚Äì3. = Return to NSL = Ahead of the 2019 season, the side, no longer sponsored by Welgris, returned to the reunited National Soccer League under the name of Morobe United. The side were drawn into the Northern Conference alongside reigning champions Toti City, whom they faced on the opening day, losing 3‚Äì1. However, the side won the remainder of their fixtures until the halfway stage, before a 0‚Äì0 draw with Toti continued their push for playoff qualification. A late-season 3‚Äì2 defeat to playoff rivals Besta PNG United threatened their playoff hopes, but a 2‚Äì1 victory against Markham FC on the penultimate weekend of the season was enough to secure second place in the conference. In the playoffs, they were drawn against Highlands Conference winners Kagua-Erave FC in the quarter-finals, winning 5‚Äì1. A two-legged defeat to Toti City saw them reach the third-place playoff, where they defeated Eastern Stars 3‚Äì2 to claim third place for the fifth time.

The property was also known as St Patrick's Estate , St. Patricks Estate, St. Patrick's Seminary or College, Cardinal's Palace, Archbishop's Residence, St Pats, St Patricks and Saint Paul's Catholic College. It was designed by Sheerin & Hennessy, Hennessy & Hennessy, Scott Green & Scott and Sydney G Hirst & Kennedy and built from 1885 to 1889 by William Farley (Residence/Palace), W. H. Jennings (College/Seminary). The property is owned by Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 January 2011. The seminary operated from 1889 until its relocation in 1995 to Strathfield where the teaching institute has become distinct from the seminary. The Catholic Institute of Sydney is now the ecclesiastical theology faculty. The Seminary of the Good Shepherd is the house of formation. Since 1996, the property has been home to the International College of Management, Sydney (ICMS). The estate also houses a high school, residential housing, the old convent, and a children's hospice. Current use The campus buildings are now occupied by the International College of Management, Sydney, a leader in career-focused, quality education offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses that are regulated and recognised in the same manner as all public universities in Australia. The Cardinal Cerretti Chapel, however, is still regularly used for weddings, with receptions often held in the Great Hall or Grand Dining Room of the adjoining building. The building appears as the exterior of Gatsby's mansion in the 2013 movie, The Great Gatsby. Palm trees at the building's exterior were digitally removed in post-production to be faithful to the East Coast, United States, where The Great Gatsby is set.  History  Conceived by Archbishops of Sydney Roger Vaughan and Patrick Cardinal Moran, the seminary was built from 1885 in Perpendicular Gothic style by Joseph Sheerin and John Hennessy on a spectacular site overlooking the Tasman Sea on a hill above Manly on Sydney's northern beaches, located towards North Head. The seminary opened on 23 January 1889. Though intended as a national seminary, it never entirely achieved that ambition.W.J. Wright, The development of a national priesthood in Australia: the first Manly generation, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, 8 (2), (1987), 35-39. An early student was Patrick Joseph Hartigan, author of the \\"John O'Brien\\" poems on Australian Catholic rural life. Two of the first novels of former student Thomas Keneally, The Place at Whitton (1964) and Three Cheers for the Paraclete (1968) are set in a fictionalized version of the seminary. Tony Abbott is a former seminarian. By the time of its centenary in 1989, 1,714 men had been ordained, having completed their training at the College. These include Cardinals Gilroy, Freeman, Cassidy and Clancy and 41 bishops. The seminary closed in November 1995, and the seminary was renamed, when numbers of seminarians no longer justified the large building and shifts in ecclesiological thinking mandated a move to the geographical centre of the Greater Sydney Area. The following outline history has been reproduced from the Conservation Management Plan for St Patrick's Estate, Manly prepared by Tanner & Associates Pty Ltd: To aid in understanding, the history of the site was divided into a number of periods: * 1810-1858: covers the period of the earliest land grants in Manly including the Quarantine Grounds on North Head. * 1859-1900: commences with the granting of land for the purpose of constructing a residence for the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney. The major buildings, St. Patrick's College, the Archbishop's Residence and the Recreation Building, date from this period. * 1901-1935: saw the division of the site by the construction of Darley Road and the erection of the Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel, the Convent and extensions to St Patrick's College. * 1936-1985: includes major site development (with buildings now considered of marginal cultural significance). * 1986-2002: includes the most recent work in the conservation of the site and its buildings. ;1810-1858: The first land grants in Manly were made to Richard Cheers (100 acres) and Gilbert Baker (30 acres) on 1 January 1810. The western boundary line of Cheers' grant physically separated North Head from what was to become Manly. In 1832 North Head was dedicated for use as a Quarantine station. Land for the Episcopal grant was later taken from the Quarantine Grounds. The immediate background to the establishment of St Patrick's College and the Episcopal residence at Manly can be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century. In 1850 public land and money had been dedicated for the purpose of constructing a residence for the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney. At first a five-acre portion of Grose Farm was suggested as a site for the Episcopal residence, but the University of Sydney had already been allocated this land in its endowment. Monastic and diocesan troubles, as McGovern has noted, along with Archbishop Polding's retirement from Sydney, caused the matter to lapse until 1856 but in that year, a request for 6 allotments at Coogee was obstructed by Surveyor General G.W. Barney, as was a subsequent claim for 15 acres on Cabarita Point on the Parramatta River. ;St Patrick's seminary in 19001859-1900: In 1859, Abbott Gregory successfully requested 60 acres adjoining and overlapping the Quarantine reserve. (On survey, the allotment was found to be 90 acres and it was subsequently cut back). \\"Honest\\" John Robertson, the Secretary for Lands, reported that since Later commentators unfairly claimed that Robertson's decision rested on \\"the advantage of having this Catholic property as a barrier between the outer public and the Quarantine Station (since) Catholics were so thick-skinned they would not take smallpox!\\" (Catholic Press, 6 September 1917, in McGovern). This notwithstanding, the grant was approved but the deed was not issued until 1879. As Sydney was without an ecclesiastical seminary an educational function was attached to the grant. Apparently the splendid isolation of the site, yet its general proximity to the city of Sydney was thought appropriate by the Church, given the need for access to a major urban centre which was a focus to the region, and a locale which enabled serious study and retreat from the pressures of normal society. Ironically, as Henry Parkes pushed through the secular Public Instruction Bill, the grant on which the largest Catholic seminary in the southern hemisphere was to be built was consolidated. In 1885, plans for the Diocesan seminary were drawn up by the Sydney architects Sheerin and Hennessy. Work began during June 1885; the foundation stone was laid and blessed on 19 November 1885, and on 23 January 1889, the opening ceremony was conducted. The magnificent and commanding structure cost 70,000 pounds to build. The builder was W.H. Jennings. The driving force behind its construction was Cardinal Patrick Moran whose strength of personality is indelibly manifest in various architectural and other details, notably the use of his initials and regalia in various carved and cast panels. The erection of the College coincided with Manly's first, though modest, suburban boom. Despite delays in building and the loss of the life of a labourer, the hill became 'the scene of great activity': \`Three hundred and twenty five men were on the pay-sheet. Labourers' tents and workmen's sheds sprang up with lightning like rapidity, so that the once desolate hill was now a veritable calico-town by day, and resembled a bivouacked army by night.' As far as building materials were concerned, the article continued, \`One cause of trouble was the contractor's inability to secure suitable stone. The opening stages of the work were built with stone hewn from near the tennis-court. The material from that quarter proving inferior, and smallpox barring entrance into the quarantine reserve, recourse had finally to be made to the quarry on the site of the Grotto of our Lady of Lourdes'.(\\"Manly\\", Vol. 1, No. 1, 1916, p. 36). The Archbishop's Residence was built slightly earlier at a cost of 10,500 pounds. Problems with its sandstone (which are evident today) led to a choice of a different quarry for the College. As with the College, Sheerin and Hennessy acted as the architects. W. Farley secured the building contract. Work commenced on the residence early in 1885 and was completed by the end of 1886. Just as work on the College was beginning, however, Manly Council made application to the Minister of Lands for the resumption of 100 feet from the high water mark fronting Cabbage Tree Bay. Shell (later Shelly) Beach and the land to the east and south of that beach as far as the Quarantine Reserve was also requested for public use.See Council Minutes, 11 June 1885 Such action required the surrendering of 8 acres and 27 perches from the Episcopal grant. And on 15 January 1886, the area - along with a separate, adjoining allotment of 2 acres 2 rods and 21 perches - was dedicated for public recreation.Official notification of the reserve was made on 10 November 1900 By way of compensation, however, the Church was granted 23 acres and 3 rods from the Quarantine Reserve behind and adjoining the original Episcopal grant. Later, on 23 August 1904, Cardinal Moran was to arrange for the purchase of an allotment of 3 rods and 11 perches connected to the south eastern end of the exchanged land. This was to finalise the general outline of the property. Prior to the transfer, the Church grounds had been bounded by a \\"high galvanised iron and barbed wire fence\\". By , however, a stone wall had been constructed along the new south eastern boundary. ;The college in 19311901-1937 Over the period 1900-1907 various small residential lots adjacent to College Street, Reddall Street, Fairy Bower Road and Bower Street were purchased by the Church. The only other modification to the property's physical dimensions resulted from the dedication of a strip of land 66 feet wide through the grounds for the extension of Darley Road. The dedication was made in 1879 and its use as a public road was declared by proclamation in the Government Gazette on 22 October 1887. Construction of the road was not undertaken, however, until World War I. In return for the land lost, the Army - which used St Patrick's tower for military observations during the war - built the stone walls which still flank Darley Road. Their design and construction appears to have been based on the stone walls previously built as a barrier between the College grounds and the Quarantine Station: they are a striking and important visual element in the landscape. The walls may have been built in stages between 1914 and 1932. In terms of building development on the site up until World War I, a recreation room which housed 2 billiard tables and a gymnasium was constructed . It survives as the Cardinal Freeman Pastoral Centre, though part of the original verandah has been removed to facilitate construction of modern garaging. The extant basketball and handball courts were also built . Other improvements in sporting facilities, according to an article by Eris O'Brien in Manly,Vol. 1, No. 1, 1916, pp. 114-116 were also undertaken around this time: 'The football field has undergone many improvements at the hands of ardent sports committees. Much excavation of rock and sand has been done, thereby making the field sufficiently large for Australian Rules. Another improvement worth mentioning is the dressing-shed, or, as it is commonly called, the grandstand. The former shed was blown down in a wind storm . . .' By this time, general upkeep and other maintenance costs were becoming a cause for concern. Thus, in 1914, it was decided: \`. . . That the outer fringe of college lands should be made available as revenue- producing to meet the upkeep of the palatial buildings which had been erected.' (\\"Manly\\", Vol. 6, No. 1, 1939, p. 34). Given that the condition of the grant forbade any on site development other than the erection of an Episcopal residence and buildings for the purpose of education, a special Bill had to be passed through the Parliament of New South Wales. The St. Patrick's College (Manly) Bill, enacted in 1914, allowed for the sub-division of approximately 21 acres \\"running down to and overlooking Shelly Beach and Fairy Bower\\". As noted in an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald (20 March 1915), allotments were offered on a leasehold basis on 27 March 1915, on the grounds. All rentals were annual and based on 5 per cent of the selling value over a period of 99 years. In terms of municipal development, the sub-division was well-timed: Manly was entering its second period of suburban boom. Leaving aside developments in the sub-division, no further building activity seems to have occurred on the grounds until the 1930s. Between 1934 and 1936 much in the way of construction took place. On 8 April 1934 the foundation stone of the Cerretti Memorial Chapel was laid and blessed: the Chapel was consecrated on 14 November 1935 and officially opened 3 days later. (The designers were Hennessy, Hennessy and Co., architectural engineers of Sydney). Construction of the Convent to the design of Ernest A. Scott, Green and Scott, Architects, was also undertaken in 1934, though the building was completed by the end of that year. The large extension behind the eastern wing of the College also designed by Ernest A. Scott, Green and Scott, Architects was completed in 1935 and involved an additional two levels of student accommodation above an enlarged kitchen facility. ;1938-1995 Post World War II developments were substantial. Kelly House was built in 1954 for residential purposes; a swimming pool made of reinforced concrete was begun at the end of 1956 (after the old baths behind the Archbishop's Residence were ruined in a violent storm) and opened on 17 November 1957;See \\"Manly\\", Vol. 9, No. 1, 1958, p.26 Gilroy House was opened in 1961 a brick addition was made to the convent in ; and St. Paul's High School was built in with further buildings added in the late 1970s. The last alteration to the physical dimensions of the property was made in 1975, when a 25m to 30m foreshore area of the Estate at Spring Cove was donated by the Church to Manly Council, thereby providing a public walkway connecting Little Manly Point to Spring Cove. A block wall consistent in height with Estate stone walls was constructed on the new site boundary. In 1986 Manly Council commissioned comprehensive Environmental Investigation and Heritage Studies of the St Patrick's Estate in preparation for the new LEP. In 1988 Manly Council's LEP zoned the majority of land north of Darley Road Special Uses Seminary, the majority of land south of Darley Road Church Purposes and four parcels of land within the Estate for residential development. In 1993 the Church announced that the Seminary would be vacating the St Patrick's estate site in 1995. ;1996 - 2002: At the end of 1995 the Seminary moved from St Patrick's College, Manly, to a site in the vicinity of the Australian Catholic University at Strathfield. Between December 1995 and May 1996, College buildings comprising Moran House, the Pastoral Centre and Kelly House were conserved and adapted with new services throughout to accommodate the residential training college - International College of Tourism and Hotel Management, which has a lease over these buildings. The new College was opened in May 1996. During this period the derelict concrete swimming pool and handball courts were demolished, and the landscaped setting in the immediate vicinity of the college buildings was repaired and its plantings enhanced. Some religious artefacts relating to the Seminary including some statuary, two stained glass windows (the \\"Rite of Tonsure\\" and 'Ordination of a Subdeacon') and the Stations of the Cross were moved with the Seminary to Strathfield. The following developments have occurred on the site in recent times: * Construction of vegetative links as bandicoot supportive habitat in locations consistent with the 1995 CMP - 1997-1998 * Construction of Bear Cottage Hospice for Children adjacent to Fairy Bower Road completed in 2001 * Construction of new attached dwellings and apartments in the eastern quarter amongst existing coastal honeysuckle trees (Banksia) and other trees; new housing in the northern quarter (adjacent to College Street which were due for completion April 2002) and minor upgrades to the garden itself. In January 2007 consent was granted by Manly Council to redevelop precincts 4,5, 6 and 10 of the estate for residential use, including the Spring Cove portion of the Estate, which was subdivided into 22, later amended to be 21 lots. A number of buildings have been completed or are in differing stages of construction since.Weir Phillips, 2015, 4  Description  ;The Archbishop's Residence (1884‚Äì85) Termed the \\"Archiepiscopal Residence\\" on the original architect's drawings, and colloquially termed 'Cardinal's Palace' during the 20th century, this was the first structure completed on the site to an impressive scale and budget. It is a good example of the domestic Gothic Revival style designed by Sheerin and Hennessy Architects and while its Gothic detailing can be held to be in the tradition established by architect Augustus Welby (A.W.) Pugin (1812-1852) in England, the cast iron verandahs are a 19th-century response to the colonial climate, while other elements such as the central fleche and convenient planning presage Edwardian architectural trends. The cast iron panels of the verandahs contain Moran's initials and their detailing reflects the later 19th century \\"Aesthetic Movement\\". Two terracotta statues of saints dominate the bays of the main elevation. The building is two storeys of stone with a slate roof. It was built by William Farley, Builder, for 10,000 pounds. The cedar joinery, parquetry flooring and stained glass windows are of exceptional quality. There are six principal rooms on the Ground Floor plus kitchens and a servants wing. The first floor contains bedrooms. The ground floor dining room, the first floor \\"Council\\" room (originally planned as a Library) with vaulted ceiling, and the cedar staircase display fine materials, detailing and craftsmanship. The Archbishop's Residence and the St. Patrick's Seminary were once linked by a carriageway. Over time verandahs have been infilled and the stable block altered, but the original fabric remains generally intact. The sandstone is of a poorer quality than Moran House and some deterioration is evident. The immediate landscape setting comprises chiefly cast iron gates with stone piers to Darley Road, the driveway, a carriage loop and a vista to the harbour and related plantings to all the above. The plantings are now mature and certain elements such as the pine plantations require replacement. There are remnants of the earlier larger gardens evident on the lower portions of the site. ;St Patrick's SeminarySt. Patrick's Seminary (1885‚Äì89) alt= The seminary was designed by Sheerin and Hennessy and built by W.H. Jennings between 1885 and 1889. The stone building is four storeys high with a six level central bell tower and a slate roof. A two storeyed colonnade flanks the central entrance. The building is splendidly sited, of high quality construction in the perpendicular Gothic style and impressive in scale. The sandstone used is of superior quality and steel members spliced into hardwood beams allows large spans. The building was designed with modern plumbing and a service lift. The simplicity of the planning and the effective use of good materials - sandstone, slate, selected timbers, marble and leaded glazing show an architectural initiative designed to last well over time. A certain grand austerity pervades the design. The entrance vestibule and \\"cloisters\\" with cedar and kauri pine ceilings, stained glass windows and marble tiled floor lead to a monumental stone staircase. Accents such as the \\"crossed\\" architraves can be found in other Gothic buildings in Sydney (such as the original portion of the University of Sydney) and may, in fact, derive from the Oxford Movement. The Library (former chapel), Refectory, Aula Maxima, Lecture Rooms and private oratory on the ground and first floors are impressive in scale and detailing and designed to form a sequence of grand interiors, on occasion with large interconnecting doors. The second and third floors provided accommodation for the seminarians in the form of small cells and communal bathroom facilities. The addition to the kitchen wing in 1935, designed by Ernest A. Scott, Green and Scott, Architects, is of comparable quality and detailing. A further addition to the kitchen wing, of lesser quality, was constructed c.1970. the second floor cubicles were converted into private rooms and bathrooms were upgraded. Originally the main interiors were decorated with rich contrasting timbers on ceilings and doors (and door surrounds) and the use of a stencilled dado, and while covered or muted, traces of this taste can be found. While some parallels can be made between this building and Sacred Heart Convent, Rose Bay and St Joseph's College at Hunters Hill, its special role and planning set it apart. The first floor corridor with its timber trussing and the eastern first floor verandah do evoke architect John Horbury Hunt's use of timber but generally the detailing is economical and practical, while remaining Gothic and ornamental. The Seminary use of this building ended in 1995. Major conservation works to Moran House were completed in 1996. The building is now, leased and occupied by the International College of Tourism and Hotel Management. Conservation works completed in 1996 included: * Repairs to stone facade, slate roofing, cast iron gutters and downpipes * New Services throughout including fire services (sprinklers, smoke detectors) and lift * Refurbishment of all rooms including bathrooms * Introduction of glazed screens for smoke compartmentation. Cardinal Freeman Pastoral Centre (formerly Recreation Centre)(1910) A single storey \\"Federation\\" style.building of rusticated coursed sandstone with a slate roof and bullnosed corrugated iron verandah was built in 1910 to provide a gymnasium and two billiard rooms for the seminarians. The building was altered c.1970 to accommodate teaching areas and a workshop. The verandah was partially demolished to enable the construction of carports, which did not complement the original centre. Major conservation works completed in 1996 included: * repairs to facade and roof * reconstruction of northern verandah * repair of coachhouse * adaptation for students' kitchen, bar and lounge ;The Cardinal Cerretti Memorial ChapelThe Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel (1934‚Äì35) This was built 40 years after the Seminary, in 1934-5 complements it in Gothic style, materials and details. It was designed by architects Hennessy, Hennessy & Co. The east end is convenient to the seminary and has an emphasis on function rather than architecture; the architectural highlight is the cluster of chapels at the west end and the 20th century structural devices which enabled the column free interiors without massive buttressing. The \\"cloister\\" aisle along the northern edge of the building, with its sequence of altars, is a distinctive and well-lit space. It is a lofty single storey building with organ and choir loft and cloisters. The nave is column-free, and features an uninterrupted vaulted ceiling with silky oak joinery, jarrah parquetry flooring and decorative plaster. The special features of the sanctuary are marble altar, sandstone altar canopy and terrazzo flooring. The chevet end displays fine marble altars and magnificent stained glass windows. The major windows appear to be of English manufacture, the lesser ones of local manufacture. (John Hardman & Co, Birmingham) Conservation works completed in 1996 include repairs to slate roof, gutters and downpipes and stonework. ;The St Therese's Convent (1934) This was designed by Ernest A. Scott, Green and Scott, Architects, to provide accommodation for the Order of Our Lady Help of Christians. Built in 1934, it is two storeys high with rendered walls and stone trims with its main elevation accented by a copper turret denoting the Chapel and a major archway framing the outlook from a verandah. The verandah was, at an early stage, glassed in. The Chapel was originally a two storeyed space with a vaulted ceiling behind the eastern bay and several small stained glass windows. The building is a well resolved domestic Edwardian dwelling. The Convent is sited on an axis with the kitchen wing of Moran House and is linked to the Seminary by a concrete pedestrian bridge. The residential addition designed by Sydney G. Hirst and Kennedy, Architects and constructed in 1962 does not complement the original convent. Today the convent is home to the Head Office of the International College of Management, Sydney (ICMS). ;St. Paul's College (1964‚Äì74) The college complex was built over ten years. The buildings are concrete-framed with face brick infill panels providing classrooms and staff and student amenities. Its location close to the Archbishop's Residence is unfortunate and its mass and basic detailing compromises the amenity of the Archbishop's Residence. = Condition = As at 19 March 2003, the buildings of the St Patrick's College group were all in good condition. The Archbishop's Residence and the Convent require conservation works. Some archaeological potential for aboriginal and European remains of earlier Seminary use of the Estate. = Archbishop's residence gardens = The Archbishop's Residence was opened in 1886. Its gardens, which comprise most of the study area, are believed to have been laid out in the late 1880s. Photographic evidence indicates that the Archbishop's gardens included landscaping, plantings and pathways. The area to be impacted by the proposed remediation works is within the gardens. A long linear path with steps linked the Residence with the harbour and the wharf, providing the link to the main transport option until the extension of Darley Road, and access to the terraced gardens, with their orchards, vegetable and flower beds. The significant buildings comprising St Patrick's Estate are remarkably intact. The 19th century landscaped setting of the Archbishop's Residence has been removed by 20th century development. Little remains of the extensive gardens and paths. The 19th century landscaped setting of the St Patrick's College is reasonably intact including evidence of the grotto and lake.

Heritage listing  As at 28 April 2010, St Patrick's Estate is a place of outstanding heritage significance to NSW and Australia. The 1885-1935 buildings and grounds of the estate make up one of Australia's most outstanding collegiate ensembles unrivalled for its completeness, grandeur and extraordinary siting. A monument to the establishment of Catholicism and the Catholic priesthood in Australia, St Patrick's Estate represents Australia's first national Catholic ecclesiastical seminary, the largest in the southern hemisphere at the time of its construction, the official national residence for the Archbishop for nearly a century, one of Australia's most extensive ecclesiastical estates and one of the oldest land grants to the Catholic Church. The College and the Archbishop's Residence have historical significance as important physical manifestations of Cardinal Moran's concepts and plans for the development of Catholicism in Australasia. The buildings have historical significance also for their associations people involved in the development of the College and Australia's priesthood. St Patrick's Estate is an outstanding landmark of Victorian Gothic architecture and natural splendour. The siting of the major buildings, their architectural style, impressive scale, and quality of design and construction are of aesthetic and social significance as they reflect the Catholic Church and Cardinal Moran's ambition that the Church's public buildings should aspire to reflect to the world the splendour of its spiritual ambitions and contribute to the fabric of national structures, worthy of a growing nation; and provide a legacy of grand ecclesiastic architecture. St Patrick's College is of aesthetic significance as it physically dominates the surrounding landscape of this part of North Head. The design of the buildings themselves is of aesthetic and social significance. The design reflects its role as a seminary and the special environment developed to encourage a devotion to the religious life is illustrated strongly in its layout. The College is socially significant to Australian Catholics, because it is a symbol of training Australian-born priests and centralising administration policy and education for the region. The St Patrick's Estate and in particular Moran House is socially significant to the wider community because of its visual prominence - it is a Manly landmark. Isolated physically and geographically on the Manly site, the Seminary buildings reflected the Church's perceptions of its special position and needs in the late 19th century. Social and cultural changes are evident in the further development of the site during the 20th century. The St Patrick's Estate has a significant relationship with the natural environment of North Head. Although isolated from the remainder of North Head by the construction of the sandstone boundary walls and the substantial clearing of the indigenous vegetation on the Estate, the St Patrick's Estate still maintains its historical and visual relationship with North Head. St Patricks Estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 January 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. St. Patrick's College was the first National Catholic ecclesiastical seminary in Australia. Together with the Archbishop's Residence, the complex is historically significant as the physical representation of Cardinal Moran's concepts and plans for the development of Catholicism in Australia. The site has considerable significance containing an intact seminary complex developed over a period of 100 years. The grounds demonstrate, by virtue of a relatively intact layout and surviving major planting, 19th century site planning and landscaping relating to an institutional complex (Tanner & Associates Pty Ltd). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The development of the site is closely associated with the life work and aspirations of Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran, who was intent on establishing a major Catholic (in particular Irish Catholic) presence in Australasia. The site is also closely associated with all Archbishops (and Cardinals) of Sydney to date, in particular Kelly and Gilroy. It is also associated with key clergy who taught at or graduated from the Seminary. Cardinal Moran hosted the first Australasian Catholic Congress at St Patrick's, Manly in 1900. Sheerin and Hennessy were architects of considerable stature (Hennessy had been responsible for the completion of the Centennial Hall at the Sydney Town Hall) whose practice included major religious structures and city buildings. Later (in the 1930s) Scott, Green & Scott undertook important works on the site. Scott, Green & Scott are best known for their finely detailed residential and educational work, including large blocks of flats in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. St Patrick's College reflects Cardinal Moran's national ambitions to train the Catholic priesthood Australia-wide, in a context of teaching and scholarship comparable with similar international institutions (Tanner & Associates Pty Ltd). The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The 1885-1935 buildings and grounds of the estate make up one of Australia's most outstanding collegiate ensembles unrivalled for its completeness, grandeur and extraordinary siting (Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners, 1996). This is a remarkable natural landscape setting and series of man-made terraces overlooking the Pacific and Sydney Harbour, enhanced planting and historic buildings with a high degree of aesthetic unity and technical and creative excellence, showing architectural and landscape tastes fashionable in the late 19th and early 20th century. It is a particularly fine example of a purpose-built institutional group. The use of the Gothic style in the buildings is part of a substantial 19th century tradition. It was deemed most suitable for religious and educational structures. St. Patrick's Estate is aesthetically significant, retaining a largely intact visual setting because of the dominance of the northern Estate by the scale of St Patrick's College and the Ceretti Chapel over associated buildings and the open prospect of the coast and nearby suburbs. St Patrick's College is of exceptional aesthetic significance because of the landmark qualities of its Gothic Revival buildings set out in the Picturesque manner against a background that borrows elements from the adjacent heathland of the National Park, coastal cliffs, the ocean and Harbour. The Archbishop's Residence and grounds are of aesthetic significance as an example of the Victorian marine villa and its landscape. The Archbishop's Residence demonstrates the deliberate siting of the residence in the Picturesque manner to address views from or to the Harbour, while simultaneously featuring Gardenesque and Italianate garden themes at the immediate house scale. Material evidence of both these themes exists in the form of plantings, paths, walls, rock cut steps and avenues. St Patrick's Estate is of aesthetic significance as an outstanding cultural landscape in a wider natural setting, that demonstrates the development, cultural preferences and social values associated with Gardenesque, Italianate, Productive, Functional, Environmental and Ecological themes of development, many historically synchronous, in the context of an ecclesiastical institution functioning over a period of 100 years. As a major group of sandstone buildings, St Patrick's College and the Archbishop's Residence demonstrates a high quality of craft, and engineering skill and sense of place achieved using local sandstone. The buildings demonstrate in their planning a high regard for natural lighting and ventilation and fire safety. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The combination of Gothic architecture and the Picturesque settings for buildings demonstrates the promotion of a moral and architectural purity characteristic of the development of Catholicism in Australia. The religious seminary and administrative function demonstrates a particular way of life and related functions held to be at the core of Catholicism. St Patrick's College, Manly reflects the desires of the Catholic Church that the Church's buildings be a public witness to Catholicism. St Patrick's Estate is held in contemporary esteem in the Manly community for its landmark qualities and for its amenity of open space. The location and prominent topography of the site, together with the siting of Moran House and the Chapel and their landscaped setting contribute to its landmark qualities and its wider community esteem. St Patrick's Estate is socially important to the Catholic Community of Australia through its influence in the training of priests for over one hundred years. The St Patrick's College Estate was established when the community of Manly was in its infancy. Manly's development has been socially and physically independent of the College. However, the wider community recognises that St Patrick's College Estate as an integral part of Manly. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Further documentary and insitu study of the Estate and the St Patrick's College has the potential to yield information contributing to an understanding of the history of Manly and the Catholic Church in New South Wales. For archaeological remains at precincts 5, 6, and 10: #Criterion (a): Buried remains of the garden would be connected with the Catholic Church's ownership and use of the site and would contribute to an understanding of the development of the site and the layout of the garden. #Criterion (b): The area and garden are connected to the Archbishop and his residence. #Criterion (c): The buried remains would give a better understanding of the garden's design. #Criterion (d): No analysis of the importance of the site for the local community has been undertaken. #Criterion (e): Evidence of the buried garden features would allow a fuller appreciation of the whole garden to be made and would remove the present discontinuity between the upper and lower sections of the garden. #Criterion (f): Remains associated with gardens of this period are not particularly rare. #Criterion (g): The garden is an example of a large institutional-style landscaped area. Evidence of the buried garden features are difficult to determine from the available plans and aerial photographs. Information on garden design and construction would be replicated on many other sites. The site is not regarded as being able to contribute to the knowledge of major research questions. The CMP found that the Archbishop's Residence is \\"integral and contributory to the historic and aesthetic development of the site and the landscape setting\\".Page 22 \\"Its gardens show classical principles of symmetry and geometry, with pleasure gardens, plantations, lawns and walks, garden beds, orchards and other ornamental/agricultural parts, laid out in geometric fashion below the Residence and both bounded and crossed by linear paths\\".Page 61 The archaeological remains buried around Gilroy House would contribute to a fuller understanding of the garden and its development. These remains would have a medium level of heritage significance at a local level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. St Patrick's Estate is rare in Australasia as the only assemblage of collegiate and ecclesiastical buildings that occupy such a visually prominent coastal location. The 1885-1935 buildings and grounds of the estate make up one of Australia's most outstanding collegiate ensembles unrivalled for its completeness, grandeur and extraordinary siting. The grand collegiate vision of Cardinal Moran was seldom attempted or achieved elsewhere in Australia. Ormond College at the University of Melbourne is of a size and completeness similar to St Patrick's but without the setting. Smaller but complete is the Newman College at the University of Melbourne and St Paul's College at the University of Sydney, yet without the grand setting. For siting it is unrivalled, but striking in the landscape are St Joseph's College and St Ignatius College in Sydney.Clive Lucas Stapleton & Partners 1996 The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. St Patrick's Estate was the first National Catholic seminary in NSW. It demonstrates the spiritual ambitions of the Catholic Church in the training of priests over a period of 100 years.

The film expands on O'Sullivan's earlier reports for BBC Newsnight and The Guardian and explores conspiracy theories related to the assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy on 5 June 1968. The title comes from a page of \\"free writing\\" found in assassin Sirhan Sirhan's notebook after the shooting upon which Sirhan had written \\"R.F.K. must die - RFK must be killed Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated... before June 5 '68.\\" Background U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy had just won the California Democratic primary and was confident that he would challenge Richard Nixon for the White House. After a victory speech in a ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, he was shot while walking through the hotel's kitchen pantry, fatally wounded by a bullet to the brain that was fired from an inch behind his right ear. Twenty-four-year-old Palestinian-American Sirhan Sirhan was convicted of murder as the lone assassin. The film investigates claims that witnesses placed Sirhan several feet in front of Kennedy and that Sirhan claims to not remember the shooting. Defense psychiatrist Bernard L. Diamond testified that Sirhan was in a hypnotic state at the time of the shooting. FBI agent William Bailey saw extra bullet holes in the pantry, suggesting that a second gunman may have been involved. Plot The film features many interviews, including one with Sirhan's younger brother Munir, who talks about his brother's upbringing and perceived injustices. Other interviewees include Paul Schrade (a union leader who was shot during the assassination), Sandra Serrano (a witness who saw two people gleefully running out of the Ambassador Hotel after the shooting) and Vincent diPierro (a witness to the assassination). Lengthy audio clips are also provided that attest to Serrano's forceful manipulation at the hands of Los Angeles police sergeant Hank Hernandez and Sirhan's extreme suggestibility to hypnosis. O'Sullivan identifies a possible second assassin, armed security guard Thane Eugene Cesar, who was immediately behind Kennedy at the time of the shooting and sold his gun soon after under mysterious circumstances. An attempt is also made to identify several figures appearing in news footage from the night of the assassination as CIA operatives who may have had a role in the assassination. The short film RFK Must Die: Epilogue details a recent audio analysis that concluded that 13 shots were fired, suggesting the possibility of a second shooter.Shane O'Sullivan's \\"RFK Must Die: Epilogue\\" (2008) Release After a three-year investigation, RFK Must Die was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 16 May 2008 and in New York on 5 June 2008, the 40th anniversary of the assassination. In November 2006, BBC Television's Newsnight aired a 12-minute screening of the documentary. Response O'Sullivan has stated that while researching a screenplay based on the Manchurian candidate theory of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, he \\"uncovered new video and photographic evidence suggesting that three senior CIA operatives were behind the killing.\\" He claimed that three men seen in video and photographs of the Ambassador Hotel immediately before and after the assassination were positively identified as CIA operatives David S√°nchez Morales, Gordon Campbell and George Joannides. However, several people who had known Morales, including family members, were adamant that he was not the man whom O'Sullivan had claimed was Morales. After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and David Talbot discovered that Campbell had died of a heart attack in 1962, six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy. In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias. He then took his identifications to the Los Angeles Police Department, whose files showed that the men whom he had identified as Campbell and Joannides were in truth Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two Bulova sales managers attending a convention at the Ambassador. O'Sullivan stood by his allegations, stating that the Bulova watch company was a \\"well-known CIA cover.\\" References External links Category:2007 films Category:British films Category:British documentary films Category:British independent films Category:Films about assassinations Category:Films about Robert F.

Seokjeok-eup is a town (eup in Korean) in South Korea on the Nakdong River. It is part of Chilgok and is situated roughly midway between the cities of Gumi and Waegwan. Many residents work at the small, mostly owner-operated local shops. However, the vast majority of the population works in either Gumi and Waegwan, and the village itself serves primarily as a bedroom community. Uprising in Seokjeok (1948) On February 2, 1948, a revolt took place that was triggered by the lack of welfare and support the government gave to keep Seokjeok a prosperous and well funded town (considering that Seokjeok was not a very wealthy town). The uprising later reached a point in which the Republic of Korea's Army and Air Force had to take action. The engagement resulted in fifty-two civilian deaths and fourteen soldiers. Many were injured. The revolt officially ended on February 10, 1948 when the South Korea government agreed to profit Seokjeok (in which it later was temporarily discontinued due to the start of the Korean War). Dissemination of local information The village is equipped with a public address system, used to provide critical information regarding military service or the Korean analogue to AMBER Alerts, among other relevant information. Cultural norms It is important to note that Seokjeok is a clean city. It is uncommon to find cigarette butts or spent chewing gum in the streets. High-rise apartment complexes dominate the landscape. In these large complexes, there is a cultural analogue to freecycling, whereby disused or no longer needed items such as furniture, small appliances, and window dressings are not discarded, but put either on the street or in enclosures reserved for that purpose. Perfectly serviceable items can be obtained for free simply by picking them up from the street. Specialized bins are reserved for general trash, food garbage, and recycling, and any attempt to place an item in an inappropriate bin will be met with a correction from a citizen or security officer. Shopping and eating The village of Seokjeok is peppered with HOF (beer) bars, takeout shops, and a few traditional restaurants. In addition, bakeries often sell sandwiches and sweet baps filled with custard for a light snack. Woobang terminal can be accessed using the 10 bus service, and a short walk to Woobang Station provides access to Daegu, approximately 15 minutes away. Gumi can be accessed using the 55 or 555 service in the opposite direction. Very large retail stores such as Lotte Mart and E-Mall can be found on the bus line in Gumi.

It was the first successful European settlement in the Cape Fear region, a major British port in the 18th century, and home to two provincial governors. Brunswick Town lasted 50 years (1726‚Äì1776) until it was raided by the British Army during the American Revolutionary War and never rebuilt. During the American Civil War, 86 years after the town was abandoned, a large portion of the town was covered by earthworks for the construction of Fort Anderson. Brunswick Town became an excavation site for Cape Fear history during the 20th century. The Brunswick Town Historic District contains the ruins of 18th-century commercial and residential colonial homes, St Philip's Church, Fort Anderson, and Russellborough, the former governor's mansion. The town's historic district and St. Philip's Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Establishment  In the decades prior to the establishment of Brunswick Town, the surrounding area was inhabited by the Cape Fear Native Americans,Conser, Walter H., Jr. (2006). A Coat of Many Colors: Religion and Society Along the Cape Fear River of North Carolina p. 15. University Press of Kentucky. . who allied with the Carolina colonists against the inland Tuscarorans in the Tuscarora War (1711‚Äì15) but subsequently fought against the colonists in the Yamasee War (1715-1717).Conser, Walter H., Jr. (2006). A Coat of Many Colors: Religion and Society Along the Cape Fear River of North Carolina p. 32. University Press of Kentucky. . In 1725, the Lord Proprietors granted Colonel Maurice Moore 1,500 acres of land where he established Brunswick Town in June 1726. The first lot was sold to Cornelius Harnett Sr. St. Philip's Church Ruins Colonel Maurice Moore was the son of South Carolina colonial governor James Moore. Colonel Maurice Moore was the father of General James Moore and Judge Maurice Moore. Judge Maurice Moore was the father of Supreme Court Associate Justice Alfred Moore. The town was named after Brunswick-L√ºneburg, the German territory ruled by Great Britain's reigning King George I. Colonel Maurice Moore had seven brothers and four sisters. One of his brothers, Roger Moore built Orton Plantation using some of the land that was granted to Colonel Maurice. Most of the Moore family moved to Brunswick Town following Maurice and Roger. The Moores became known as \\"The Family\\". During the next few months, Brunswick Town grew rapidly and became a busy port for exporting longleaf pine products such as tar, pitch, and turpentine used for the Royal Navy and merchant ships. During the 1730s, Brunswick Town became the political center of the Cape Fear region and seat of New Hanover County. Brunswick Town was crucial to Wilmington because the Cape Fear river was too shallow near the mouth of Town Creek for large vessels to pass through. The town was the third capital city of the Province of North Carolina, from 1743 to 1770 (although this title simply referred to the town where the current governor resided rather than any official designation).  Spanish attack  Mosaic depicting the Spanish attack Over the next few decades the Port of Brunswick became the busiest port district in North Carolina, and shipped goods to Europe and the British West Indies. England was at war with Spain and France on and off. Cape Fear was a perfect place for their enemies to attack. During September 3‚Äì6, 1748, Brunswick Town was attacked by Spanish privateers. Two ships, La Fortuna and La Loretta anchored off the Town. Terrified, the townspeople fled into neighboring woods. On September 4, 1748, the Spanish began raiding the town for slaves and anything else they could find that was valuable. Since the townspeople had left everything behind, the Spanish were able to raid the abandoned ships and houses without resistance. On September 5 Captain William Dry III rallied a group of around 67 men who were armed with muskets and pistols to take back the town. William Dry III with the help of William Moore, Schenk Moore, Edward Wingate, Cornelius Harnett Jr., and William Lord started the counterattack on September 6. Among the men was also a slave who was volunteered by George Ronalds. The Spanish fled from the town. Ten of the privateers were killed and thirty were captured. During the retreat, the La Fortuna exploded killing most of the men on board. The second ship, La Loretta, surrendered on the condition that they would be able to leave. During the counterattack, only one person defending the town lost his life. The slave that was volunteered by George Ronalds lost his life when a small cannon exploded. The abandoned ship, La Fortuna, was still in the river when the remainder of the privateers had been thrown out of the town. William Dry III hired sailors to search the La Fortuna for anything valuable. The sailors were able to bring ashore guns, anchors, and items stolen from the town. Among the items confiscated from the ship was a painting depicting the Ecce Homo. The painting was given to St. James Church, Wilmington by the North Carolina General Assembly and remains there today. The town was able to sell the Spanish slaves and goods from the abandoned ship. The funds that were obtained from the sales were used to build St. Philip's Church, Brunswick Town and St. James Church, Wilmington.  Russellborough  Russellborough toilet (circa 1758) Russellborough was first owned by Captain John Russell of his majesty's sloop, Scorpion. However, the grand two-story house and plantation was not completed at the time Royal Governor Arthur Dobbs purchased the land in 1758. Governor Dobbs made a few changes to the house and finished it. He called it \\"Castle Dobbs\\". After Governor Dobbs death in 1765, William Tryon was sworn in as Governor, Province of North Carolina. Governor Tryon moved into what he called \\"Castle Tryon\\" in 1765. After Governor Tryon's house in New Bern, North Carolina was completed he moved his family into what is known as Tryon Palace. Governor Tryon sold his Brunswick Town plantation to William Dry III who renamed the plantation Bellfont. In 1776 the plantation was burned by British troops. When the construction of Fort Anderson was being completed, Russellborough was untouched. Today the excavated ruins can be seen at Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson North Carolina State Historic Site. Artifacts from Russellborough can also be viewed in the exhibit hall located in the visitor center.  Stamp Act resistance  On November 1, 1765, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act. That same month, the HM Sloop Diligence arrives at the port with stamps. However, angry citizens of Brunswick Town met the Captain at the dock refusing to allow the stamps off the ship. Governor Tryon attempted to calm residents down but he was determined to uphold the law. In February 1766, the Dobbs and the Patience arrived at Brunswick Town. The ships did not have stamp clearance, and were not allowed to unload. On February 20, 1766, Patriot leaders, John Ashe, Cornelius Harnett, James Moore, Captain Robert Howe and Colonel Hugh Waddell led several hundred citizens to arrest royal officials in the town. The patriots also surrounded the governor's home in protest to the Stamp Act of 1765 and placed Tryon under house arrest. The protest was possibly one of the first incidents of armed colonial resistance to British rule. The protest resulted in the end of stamp tax collection for the Cape Fear region.  Decline of the town  Hepburn-Reynolds House foundation in Brunswick Town Historic District (2008) With the combination of Wilmington's continued growth and Tryon moving to his new palace in New Bern, the Town of Brunswick continued to decline. By 1775, the few families that still lived in Brunswick Town fled due to fears of a British attack during the American Revolutionary War. On July 18‚Äì21, 1775, Patriots led by Robert Howe, Cornelius Harnett, and John Ashe attacked Fort Johnston while Captain Collett and Governor Josiah Martin watched from the Cruizer. The following spring of 1776, British soldiers from the Royal Navy ship Cruizer attacked Brunswick Town. The soldiers, led by Captain Collett, burned most of the town's structures including Russellborough and more than likely Saint Phillips Church . Later, under orders from General Clinton and General Cornwallis, British soldiers burned parts of the town again. After the war, two or three families returned to Brunswick. The port was still functioning but by 1830 the town site was completely abandoned and sold to Frederick Jones Hill, owner of Orton Plantation, for $4.25. In March 1862, Confederate States Army engineers began to survey the remains of Brunswick Town. The Confederates built earthworks and trenches in the town site, covering the remains of several burnt structures except for St. Philip's Church. The fort was constructed to protect the city of Wilmington 10 miles (16 km) upstream, a vital port during the Civil War. The bastion was named Fort St. Philip, but renamed Fort Anderson in July 1863.[10] During the attack on Fort Anderson in February 1865, cannonballs shot from Union ships in the Cape Fear River hit the walls of St. Philip's Church and are still evident today.  Excavation  In 1899, the newly formed Cape Fear Chapter of the North Carolina Society of The Colonial Dames of America visited Brunswick Town to pay homage to Revolutionary War casualties. In 1902, the chapter erected a marble plaque inside the roofless ruins of St. Philip's to commemorate Brunswick Town founder Maurice Moore. In 1952, Dr. Lawrence Lee Jr. expressed interest in Brunswick Town and stated that the site should be excavated. Dr. Lee was contracted by the State Department of Archives and History, now known as the Department of Cultural Resources, in 1958 to clear out the land and find the town ruins. Dr. Lawrence Lee Jr. Requested the help of Archaeologist Stanley South. South began extensive excavations at Brunswick Town in 1958, and items such as bullets, buttons, and a cannonball were retrieved inside the St. Philip's Church ruins. The remains of Brunswick Town are now a state historic site. Visitors may tour the town's remains and the earthworks of Fort Anderson.  In popular culture  Brunswick Town is also one of the settings in which the Sleepy Hollow television series has been filmed.

The money for its purchase was bequeathed to the town of Kilmarnock by former native insurance broker Alexander Kay who died in Glasgow in January 1866. The location of the park was determined by the town council and the Kay Trustees after various proposed sites were examined and the land was purchased from the Duke of Portland. The park opened on 9 August 1879 with great pomp and circumstance. It is the home of the Burns Monument, a large monument to poet Robert Burns. The Burns Monument was badly damaged by fire in November 2004, however it was later redeveloped to provide a marriage suite, registration service and local history research service. There was formerly a miniature golf course, a few drinking fountains, pubs, boating in the pond and a band stand on the site, but now only a single non- functional fountain remains. The Kilmarnock-Dumfries railway line passes the park, although the line is used for freight rather than passenger trains.

Demolombe is best known for his commentary of the Code Civil, in favour of whose completion he declined an appointment to the Court of Cassation. The commentary was originally planned to encompass 20 volumes. However, Demolombe could not meet his own exigent standards: even after the publication of 31 volumes from 1845 to 1882, the commentary covered only half of the Code. After Demolombe's death, the work was continued by Guillouard in much reduced form. The monumental commentary caused Demolombe to be hailed as the greatest French jurist of his time, but his critics lambasted the work's excessive attention to detail as well as Demolombe's liberal appropriation of the ideas of others, his neglect of the Code's dogmatic structure and his overly elaborate and descriptive style. Because of these defects, the commentary came to be mostly ignored soon after Demolombe's death.

With Heinrich Harrer, Fritz Kasparek, and Anderl Heckmair, he successfully climbed the north face of the Eiger in 1938, which was regarded as unclimbable at the time. He also made the first ascent of the West Face of Ushba in the Caucasus. V√∂rg was killed in action on the first day of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.Turnbull R., The Book of the Bivvy, p.27, 2001  The 'Bivouac King'  Prior to attempting to north face of the Eiger, V√∂rg had been the first person to climb the west face of Ushba in the Caucasus. It was during this climb on the 7000 ft high ice face that V√∂rg earned his nickname from his fellow climbers.  1937 on the Eiger  V√∂rg and Matthias Rebitsch were planning an attempt of the North Face in 1937 when news came that two Austrian climbers, Franz Primas and Bertl Gollackner, were stuck high on the North East face in ferocious conditions. V√∂rg and Rebitsch immediately began their climb up the Lauper Wall, where they too were caught in the storm. The face was streaming with torrents of water, glazed rocks, and avalanches. They were forced to bivouac high on the face on a tiny perch of rock. In the morning they pushed on to the hut on the Mittellegi Ridge, taking a break to dry their clothes and rest. Late in the afternoon, two guides reported to the hut that they had brought a freezing exhausted Primas down from the ridge, but that Gollackner was dead 500 ft below the summit. They volunteered to recover the body, and carried it down the knife edge of the Mittellegi Ridge. V√∂rg and Rebitsch had put their own lives at risk for the sake of others; it was a trait in V√∂rg that would come out again the following year.H. Harrer, \\"The White Spider\\", pp.70-72 Harper Perennial  Climbing the Eiger's North Face in 1938  V√∂rg was attempting the Eiger with Anderl Heckmair. They had set off in pursuit of the preceding team in a race to the top. When they caught up with the Austrian team of Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek (V√∂rg and Heckmair's superior 12-point crampons were more useful on the Eiger; Harrer didn't have any crampons at all) they decided to proceed as a four. When they reached the 'Spider' icefield high on the face, they were hit by a ferocious storm, avalanches pounding down upon them. Andreas Heckmair describes what happened when he slipped from the face. > I bore straight down on him in a lightning swift slide. Wiggerl let the rope > drop and caught me with his hands, and one of the points of my crampons went > through his palm. The force with which I came down on Wiggerl knocked him > out of his holds, but he, too, had been able to save himself and there we > were, standing about 4 feet below our stance on steep ice without any > footholds. Our Friends...hadn't even noticed anything had happened. If we > hadn't checked our fall we would have hurled them out from the face with us > in a wide arc.Anderl Heckmair, Die drei letzten Probleme der Alpen, > Bruckmann Verlag, 1949 V√∂rg, it seems, saved the whole party from certain death, and without his bravery there would never have been the legendary tales of Heinrich Harrer. The four went on to reach the summit, and glory, on 24 July 1938.

Dening born in Newcastle, New South Wales. He was educated at two Jesuit schools, St. Louis School in Perth and Xavier College in Melbourne. He received an MA from the University of Melbourne and a PhD from Harvard University, where his doctoral dissertation was a historical ethnography of the Marquesas Islands. From the late 1960s he became the centre of an ethnographic history school called the 'Melbourne Group'. He taught sociology and history at La Trobe University, Melbourne and one semester of anthropology at the University of Hawai'i before being appointed Max Crawford Professor of History at the University of Melbourne in 1971. As Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Melbourne, he was one of Australia's most eminent historians, and one of the preeminent historians and anthropologists of the South Pacific. From 1998 to 2004 he taught ten-day graduate workshops at the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research at the Australian National University, Canberra. He died on 13 March 2008 in Hobart. Vanessa Smith of the University of Sydney spoke of \\"...his unique gift as a historian, unobtrusively demonstrating that the most acute critical perception is not incommensurate with the deepest appreciation of his subjects' human circumstances.\\" Personal life He entered the Society of Jesus in 1948. In 1970 he left the priesthood because he could not preach against the use of birth control, the banning of which was outlined by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical Humanae Vitae in 1968. Together with his wife, American-born Donna Merwick (another significant historian who dealt mainly with the early colonial histories of New York) Dening served as a mentor for many and often described history- making as a process of \\"performance\\". They thus centred their collaborative seminars around this notion of performing and \\"Doing History\\", as Dening called it, since it involved \\"present\\"-ing the past. His personal life was deeply entwined with his professional life, as he inspired generations of Pacific and Australian historians and taught a special brand of humility toward his subject material. He devoted much of his time to nurturing students and exploring his own fascinations with Oceania and encounters between indigenous people and outsiders on the in-between spaces of the \\"beach\\", a metaphor he developed rigorously. Quotes *\\"...the abiding grace of history...[is that] it is the theatre in which we experience truth\\". (Performances, 1996) *\\"In the theater of my history, I want the reader to go where I haven't been. It is not for me to say whether I have succeeded in doing that.

Professional career  Since 1991, Roux has taught at the Waldorf School in Stuttgart. His work as a composer, arranger and pianist (both solo and ensemble) started while he was at university. Musical direction of productions such as Wakeman, Wakeman 2 and With a little help from my friends followed. Increasingly, he added choral composition and conducting to his list of musical activities. Resident in Europe, Roux has participated in musical festivals such as the Tonk√ºnstlerfest (Baden-W√ºrttemberg, 1990 and 1993) and the International Composers' Workshop (Amsterdam, 1996). In 1999, he delivered a lecture-recital for the Stuttgart German-American Society on South African (township) jazz. His commitment to African musical forms, rhythms and instrumentation has, however, remained central to his creative vision. He has composed syncretically in avant-garde, post-avant-garde and contemporary classical styles (so-called new music), with his music regularly being performed in Germany, South Africa, the UK and the US. As an arranger he has become well known for his arrangements of South African music (traditional Afrikaans, Cape-Malay and Zulu ‚Äìfor piano, ensemble and voice). Over the past few years his musical association with the music organisation Music is a great Investment (MIAGI), as well as super groups Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Kwela Tebza has brought him wider recognition as both a composer and arranger, in South Africa and abroad.

Today it serves as bed and breakfast accommodation. History A mill has stood on this site since 1596, and a post mill is known to have been built here in 1758. Gibbet Mill was built in 1824, the name Barry's mill coming from an early miller. The mill was working by wind until 1912, and was used as a bakery until 13 June 1930 when it was burnt down. The new mill was erected in 1932, Neve's of Heathfield being responsible for the millwrighting work. Description As built, Gibbett Mill was a four-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base, with a stage at first-floor level. In 1844 she had four Patent sails but latterly was worked with four Spring sails. These were carried in a cast-iron Windshaft. The cap was in the Kentish style, winded by a fantail. The mill drove three pairs of millstones. The replica mill bears very little resemblance to an actual working windmill. It has a shorter smock, making the mill appear squatter than the original. The cap is exaggerated in height and is not designed to turn into the wind. Replica sails and fantail are carried. The reconstructed stage is wider than the original.

In two decades as its Chairman of Commissioners, he revolutionised Victorian Railways, with unprecedented attention to customer service and innovations such as more powerful locomotives, air-conditioned carriages, and faster services culminating in the introduction of the flagship Spirit of Progress express train. Seconded to the Federal Government in World War II, he played a pivotal role in the manufacture of fighter aircraft in the defence of Australia. As Director-General of Australia's Land Transport Board, he presented a report on railway gauge standardisation that ultimately led to the eventual linking of all Australian mainland capital cities by a uniform rail gauge. Early life and career abroad Born in St Kilda, Victoria, Harold Clapp was the son of Cobb and Co coach operator and future Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company owner Francis Boardman Clapp and wife Isabella Pinnock, n√©e Pierce. He was educated at Brighton Grammar and Melbourne Church of England Grammar schools, before serving an apprenticeship at the Austral Otis Engineering Co. and later taking charge of motive power in his father's Brisbane Tramway Co. Ltd.Lee, p.146 In 1900 Clapp left for the United States of America, first obtaining work at the General Electric Co. He was then engaged by the Interborough Rapid Transit Co., and among other work was in charge of electrification of the West Jersey and Seashore division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On 19 September 1906 at Providence, Rhode Island, he married Gertrude Vivien, daughter of Judge Arthur Noel of Brisbane. In 1908 he moved to Columbus, Ohio and joined the Southern Pacific Railroad. By 1920, he was a Vice President of the Southern Pacific, as well as the Columbus Railway Power and Light Co and Illinois' East St. Louis and Suburban Railway. Victorian Railways career Premier Harry Lawson appointed Clapp as Chairman of the Commissioners of Victorian Railways in September 1920 on the recommendation of former Chairman Sir Thomas James Tait, who had known Clapp prior to his move to the United States. With an annual salary of ¬£5,000, Clapp was Australia's highest-paid public servant at the time.Lee, p.145 Clapp arrived in September 1920, and began an extraordinary period of reform of Victorian Railways. During his tenure, timetables were improved, larger and more powerful locomotives were built, services were improved, and the VR expanded operations into everything from motor coach services, a ski chalet, and creches to bakeries and raisin bread marketing. =Management style= Clapp enjoyed cordial relations with his staff, union officials, and was fortunate to have the support of highly capable Railways Ministers from both sides of politics, including future Premier of Victoria John Cain and future Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies.Lee, p.151 Harold Clapp famously quipped that \\"The railway is ninety-five percent men and five percent iron.\\" He was possessed of a remarkable memory and learnt the names and faces of many thousands of railway employees. He regarded stationmasters, who dealt with the public at many levels, as \\"his front line soldiers\\". Although his approach to industrial relations has been judged as paternalistic,Lee, p.154 his concern for workers' conditions was genuine and he was personally responsible for improvements such as better sanitation facilities and the provision of decent cafeterias at Newport Workshops. Harold Clapp's fastidiousness for cleanliness was legendary. He was reputed to polish his shoes up to eight times a day, was renowned for running a finger along high shelves of country railway stations checking for dust, and earned the nickname \\"Clever Mary\\", after a popular brand of household cleaning product of the time.Lee, p.147 Clapp's cleanliness was matched by his punctuality, a quality he expected in his employees and in his railway. Improvements in service reliability earned the ultimate compliment by way of the following complaint published in a Melbourne newspaper: \\"Mr Clapp's fiendish efficiency means that we have lost another excuse for being late for work in the mornings.\\" =The \\"Reso\\" and Better Farming Trains= Clapp was notable for his support and assistance to the farming sector. This reflected not only a desire to boost rail traffic through increased farm production and customer demand, but also a belief that the role and social responsibilities of the Victorian Railways as an organisation went far greater than simply the provision of transport. To this end, he introduced two special trains with the aim of developing the rural economy of Victoria, the Better Farming Train and the Reso Train (for Victorian National Resources Development). These trains served to link up businessmen with primary producers and develop entrepreneurial relationships, as well as educate farmers on the latest developments and best practices in agricultural science. =Motive power improvements= Victorian Railways Petrol Electric railmotor, introduced in 1928 At the time that Harold Clapp took over, the VR goods locomotive fleet was almost completely of 19th century designs that were largely obsolete.Lee, p.158 Clapp set about modernising the fleet, firstly with construction commencing in 1921 of 25 further examples of the prototype C class heavy goods locomotive of 1918, as well as introducing three new classes of locomotive which proved to be of highly successful design, the K class and N class light-lines locomotives of 1922 and 1925, and the X class heavy goods locomotive of 1929. With a large fleet of relatively new A2 class locomotives available, there was far less development of new passenger locomotives during the Clapp era. Even so, the two classes that were ordered during his time (the 3-cylinder S and H classes) were of unprecedented size, power and technical innovation.Lee, p.159 As an efficiency measure, Clapp dispensed with the \\"Canadian Red\\" locomotive livery introduced by his predecessor Sir Thomas Tait, replacing it with a plain black livery that required less cleaning. In other key developments that drew on his US railroad experience, he oversaw the introduction of electric lighting on VR locomotives and the fitting of auto- couplers. Clapp also oversaw the introduction of important innovations in alternative motive power. These included the E class electric suburban goods locomotives and the introduction of rail motors to provide faster, more cost effective services than steam locomotives. =Improved timetables= Clapp focused on accelerating timetables, in many cases achieving considerable savings (and even more considerable favourable publicity for Victorian Railways) simply through better utilisation of existing technology. He introduced Victoria's first \\"named train\\", the Geelong Flier in May 1926, which cut the journey time between Melbourne and Geelong to just one hour, using existing rolling stock hauled by an A2 class locomotive of 1907 design. In 1935 Clapp raised the maximum line speed limit on Victorian Railways from 60 to 70 mph (96 to 112 km/h) and the Flier subsequently ran to Geelong on a 55-minute timetable. The public relations success of the Flier was reflected by the train's name entering the local lexicon as a metaphor for speed; former Geelong Football Club player Bob Davis was nicknamed \\"The Geelong Flier\\"; and even in 2005 current player David Wojcinski was said to \\"run like the Geelong Flier of yesteryear\\". Similarly, the Adelaide Express was renamed The Overland in 1926, despite some reluctance from the South Australian authorities who jointly ran the inter-capital service. Clapp oversaw the reduction in running time for the service from sixteen and a half hours in 1928 to around fourteen hours in 1938 (with the departure time changed from 4:30pm to a much more convenient 7:00pm),Lee, p.157 achieved at very moderate cost simply through the introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange equipment between Ballarat and Serviceton to allow unimpeded progress from one track section to the next, and design improvements to the existing A2 class locomotive fleet to increase power and efficiency. =Spirit of Progress= The Spirit of Progress headed by locomotive S301 Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1938 In 1934, Clapp toured Europe and North America to investigate new developments in rail technology such as diesel locomotives. On his return, he began work on his ultimate project, upgrade of the Sydney Limited service into the all-steel, all-air-conditioned, non-stop, high-speed express streamliner, Spirit of Progress. Clapp's decision to invest considerable funds into Spirit of Progress was based on entirely pragmatic considerations. In an age before interstate air travel was common, politicians and heads of industry rode between Australia's two largest capital cities and the national capital Canberra by train. The upgrade of the service was then a smart investment in promoting the Victorian Railways brand and its reputation to the nation's most powerful and influential people.Lee, p.161 The train was truly world class, running non-stop along its entire 190.5 mile (306.5 km) length at an average speed of 52 mph (83 km/h) between Albury and Melbourne, a speed comparable to that of the legendary Flying Scotsman service of the London and North Eastern Railway. Harold Clapp's personal involvement in its design and construction was all-encompassing, from the auto-couplers connecting the carriages to the Art Deco interior design. Clapp's time at Victorian Railways is often viewed as being the halcyon days for the organisation. However, during Clapp's tenure the VR was already struggling to match new competition from road transport, as well as to remain profitable despite the legacy of a network of short, inefficient branch lines built in the late 19th century for reasons of political expediency rather than economic merit, challenges that were to bedevil Clapp's successors. The VR only turned a profit in two of the nearly twenty years that he was at its helm. Wartime aviation production Four Australian Beauforts of No. 100 Squadron RAAF near the New Guinea coast in early 1945. In May 1939, with the outbreak of World War II imminent, Clapp was seconded by then Prime Minister Robert Menzies to become general manager of the Aircraft Construction Branch of the Commonwealth Department of Supply and Development, overseeing the construction of Bristol Beaufort bombers in Australia.Lee, p.166 He was made chairman of the new Aircraft Production Commission in March next year. Although Beaufort bombers were advanced aluminium aircraft requiring complex and previously untried assembly processes, the first flew as early as August 1941. During 1942 they were delivered at the rate of sixteen per month and in 1943 at 29 per month. The last of 700 was delivered in August 1944, by which time production had shifted to Beaufighter fighter-bomber, of which 364 were completed by the end of the war. Clapp was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1941 New Year Honours \\"[f]or public services in the Commonwealth of Australia.\\" Commonwealth Land Transport Board Clapp's 1945 proposals for standardisation of Australia's railway gauges The break-of-gauge platform for the Sydney‚ÄìMelbourne railway at Albury station, where passengers disembarked from broad gauge trains from Melbourne to board standard gauge trains to Sydney. In February 1942, Clapp was appointed Director-General of Land Transport by the Curtin Government to co-ordinate Commonwealth and State road and rail transport. In 1944, he was asked to prepare a report on the standardisation of rail gauges in Australia. The Second World War, in generating greatly increased rail traffic through the shipment of men, munitions and supplies around the country, exposed the inefficiency of a national rail system built on several systems built to different gauges. Multiple break-of-gauge points across the country between narrow gauge, standard gauge and broad gauge compromised the ability of the railways to support the war effort and required upwards of 1,600 men at various break-of- gauge points to transfer cargo from one train to another. Clapp submitted a national rail plan for the complete conversion of the Victorian and South Australian broad-gauge networks to standard gauge, the conversion of the Silverton Tramway and south-east South Australian narrow gauge lines to standard gauge, and the linking of Perth to Kalgoorlie by a new standard gauge link, at a cost of ¬£44,318,000. He further recommended and the linking of Darwin to the national network via a new standard gauge link to be built from Queensland at a cost of ¬£10,898,000, and a new inland standard gauge link through New South Wales and Queensland, cost ¬£21,565,000. Parochial state interests thwarted the plan from being adopted. New South Wales refused to ratify the agreement as only a relatively small proportion of the project cost would be spent in NSW, where almost all track was already standard gauge. South Australia objected to the Darwin link being built from Queensland rather than extending the existing Central Australia Railway link from Adelaide to Alice Springs. Clapp's report was used in 1956 as a basis for further recommendations by the Government Members Rail Standardisation Committee chaired by William Wentworth, which concluded that \\"while there may be considerable doubts as to the justification for undertaking large-scale standardisation of Australian railways under present circumstances, there can be no doubt that the standardisation of main trunk lines is not only justified, but long overdue.\\" By 1962, Melbourne was linked to Sydney by a standard gauge link, and by 1970 the standardisation of the transcontinental link from Sydney to Perth was completed. Another key element of Clapp's 1945 proposal was delivered, at least in part, with the standardisation of the broad gauge Crystal Brook line connecting Adelaide to the transcontinental Sydney‚ÄìPerth railway in 1982, followed by the standardisation of South Australia's non-metropolitan broad gauge network and most of the broad gauge network in western Victoria in 1995, including the main Melbourne-Adelaide railway. Retirement and death Locomotive B 60, later named Harold W. Clapp, on its delivery run to Melbourne is passed by one of Clapp's earlier S class streamliners In September 1951 Clapp resigned for health reasons but continued to act as a consultant to the Department of Shipping and Transport. On 14 July 1952 the first of the B class diesel electric locomotives, which were to revolutionise train operations in Victoria, was delivered to the VR and travelled from NSW to Melbourne's Spencer Street station under its own power. The elderly Harold Clapp climbed into the cab of locomotive B 60 and sat at the controls, and was honoured by having the new locomotive named after him.Lee, p.217 On 21 October 1952 he died in hospital, leaving behind his wife, two sons and a daughter. Tributes were paid by many, including then Prime Minister Robert Menzies. Journalist C. R. Bradish described him as \\"a remarkable man\\", with \\"sufficient power and imagination to give the Victorian Railways a reputation they had never known before\\".

It was made by some realist philosophers of the Scholastic period in the thirteenth century, and particularly by Duns Scotus.  Background  Many realist philosophers of the period (such as Aquinas and Henry of Ghent), recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual, but not fully real or mind-independent either. Aquinas held that the difference between our concepts arises not just in the mind, but has a foundation in the thing (fundamentum in re). Henry held that there was an 'intentional' distinction (distinctio intentionalis) such that 'intentions' (i.e. concepts) that are distinct in the mind, correspond to things which are potentially distinct in reality. Scotus argued for a formal distinction (distinctio formalis a parte rei), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality, but whose definitions are not identical. For example, the personal properties of the Trinity are formally distinct from the Divine essence. Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or haecceity of a thing and its existence is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.Honderich p. 209 There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul. Ockham was opposed to the idea, arguing that whenever there is any distinction or non-identity in reality, then two contradictory statements can be made. But contradictory statements cannot be truly asserted unless the realities they stand for are either (1) distinct real things (2) distinct concepts or (3) a thing and a concept. But if they all exist in reality, they are not distinct concepts, nor are they a real thing and a concept. Therefore, they are distinct in reality.Ockham, Ordinatio I. i. q1.

Plot summary  After his friend, a successful young artist, is killed in a car accident, Tom Ripley (Pepper) and his friends hide his body and concoct a scheme in which they forge his paintings, eventually making a great deal of money. When an art collector (Dafoe) complains that a painting he bought from the gallery is a fake, Ripley must use his inimitable talents to defuse the problem by whatever means necessary.  Cast  *Barry Pepper as Tom Ripley *Willem Dafoe as Neil Murchison *Alan Cumming as Jeff Constant *Tom Wilkinson as John Webster *Jacinda Barrett as H√©lo√Øse Plisson *Claire Forlani as Cynthia *Ian Hart as Bernard Sayles *Douglas Henshall as Philip Derwatt *Fran√ßois Marthouret as Antoine Plisson  Release and reception  The film received a wide theatrical release on 6 November 2005, as well as being shown at the AFI Fest film festival in Los Angeles. It was released on DVD on 24 July 2007 in the Netherlands. Given the film's low-profile release, critical reviews have been scarce. Variety's review was less than positive, saying: \\"Although it strives to push Patricia Highsmith's best-known bad man in a snarky direction, Ripley Under Ground is too fidgety and unsure to settle on a sustained tone and ends up in a no man's land between hysterical satire and sleek Euro thriller. As previous filmic Ripleys demonstrated, from Purple Noon and The American Friend to The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley's Game, it's all in the casting, and the talented Mr. Barry Pepper is not capable of pulling off the demonically complicated and murderous con artist.\\" References  External links  Category:2005 films Category:2005 crime thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:British films Category:French films Category:German films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Roger Spottiswoode Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on crime novels Category:Films based on works by Patricia Highsmith Category:Films about psychopaths Category:Films about fictional painters Category:Films about con artists Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in France Category:Films scored by Jeff Danna Category:French crime thriller films Category:German crime thriller films ","title":"Ripley Under Ground (film)"},{"id":"17367578","text":"Haojiang District () is a district of Shantou, Guangdong province, People's Republic of China.

The most important festival for Hindu Sindhis is the birthday of Lord Jhoolelal and Cheti Chand. Sindhi Hindus festivals 1\\\\. Cheti ChandCheti Chand festival Celebration of the birth of the Avatar of Water god (Varun Devta) Sai Uderolal, popularly known as Jhulelal . So much has been said and written about it that it would be superfluous to mention the event again. In Sindh the beginning of the New Year was considered Cheti Chand . Some businessmen opened new account books on Cheti Chand; many however, did that on the eve of Diwali. On the full moon day, people used to go to a river or lake and offer 'Akho' with a pinch of rice mixed with milk and flour. If there was no river or 'Darya', the ritual was performed at a well. Even Sindhi Sikhs go to temples or Gurudwaras, because Guru Nanak's birthday also falls on P≈´rnima. 2\\\\. Sagra (Sacred thread) Sindhi Bhaibands often lived in foreign countries; therefore, their wives were always worried about the good health of their husbands. For this purpose they performed pooja and fasted on four Mondays of Sawan month, after which they perform pooja, distribute sweet rice and then had the sacred thread tied on the wrist by the priest ( Bandhan ). 3\\\\. Mahalakshmi's Sacred Thread (Mahalakshmi-a-jo-Sagro) This sacred thread had 16 strips and 17 days. On the day when the sacred thread was to be untied, it was celebrated as an important day and special savouries like satpura and pakwan of Suji & Maida were made and distributed firstly to the priests and the poor and afterwards the remaining savouries were used by family members. 4\\\\. Fasts In Sindhis, generally Mondays & Saturdays, Giyaras or Umaas were observed as fasts ( vrats ). During the fast of Satyanarayan and nine days of Ekaanaas, only one time meal was generally taken. 5\\\\. TeejriTejri festival This festival takes place in the month of Sawan when married women and girls paint their hands and feet with Mehndi, go on fast for the whole day, during which they used to play games, swing in Jhulas and sing love songs. Orthodox or strict Sindhi women do not even drink a sip of water until they break their fast. In the night after making an offering to the moon, they would break the fast. This is also referred to as the Sindhi version of Karwa Chauth 6\\\\. Akhan TeejAkhan Teej festival In Sindh, Akshaya Tritiya is known as Akhandi which is celebrated in Vaisakha. On this day new earthen pots of water(matkas) were kept and everyone was offered clean and cool water. The significance of this day was to offer water to the thirsty. Hence at every nook and corner, sharbat, with pieces of apple in it, was offered to passersby along with 'prasad' . On this day, it was also customary to send new earthen pots and fruits to priests and Gurdwara. 7\\\\. AUnn-Matyo In the month of Sawan, on the Baaras of Krishna Paksha, cereals were changed in food, i.e. instead of wheat and rice, chapatis made of gram flour (Besan) were eaten. 8\\\\. Ban Badhri During the month of 'Bado', during the Baaras of Shukla Paksha, god Varun had taken avatar. In lieu of that small insects like ants etc. were fed Gur (jaggery) and Musti. Married daughters are invited by their parents for meals. 9\\\\. Somavati Umaas During certain months Umaas takes place on a Monday. That day is considered important for having a \\"dumb dip' in the waters; without talking to anyone early in the morning. It is also, called 'Gungee Umaas\\". 10\\\\. Nandhi and Vaddi Thadri Both of these take place in the month of Sawan. On the day before Thadree day, people cook lola (sweet flour cakes) and rote (fried cakes) because there has to be no lighting of fire in the house on the Thadree day. The lolas and Rotes are eaten with curd or pickle. On that day drops of water are also sprinkled on the cooking fire to appease Sitladevi Mata. 11\\\\. Janamashtami, Ram Navmi and Shivratri Since Krishna was born after midnight, on Janamashtami, bhajans and kirtan are held in temples till midnight. On Ram Navmi, Lord Rama's birthday is celebrated. On Shivratri people drink 'Thaadhal' with some 'bhang' in it, after making offering of it in the Mahadev temple. In the villages and cities, big pots of 'Taahri' (sweet rice) are prepared and distributed among all. 12\\\\. Tirmoori On this festive day parents send ladoos & chiki ( Laaee ) made of Tils to their married daughters. On the Makar Sankrant day the sun moves from south to north. It is therefore also called 'utraan' or 'Tirmoori' . In Mahabharat battle Bhisham Pitamah did not breathe his last till ‚Äò utraan' since on this day there happens flush of light in Dev Lok . 13\\\\. Dussehra Few days before Dussehra there used to be Ramlila program which was attended by throngs of people. On the Dussehra day colourful effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Meghnath were burnt. 14\\\\. Diyaaree Two days before Diwali, Sindhis start lighting Diyaas (earthen lamps) from 'Dhan Teras' . The bazaars are full with prospective consumers. Friends and relatives meet one another with affection and extended pleasantries and sweetmeats. In the night, Laxmi Poojan takes place when all the members of the family pray with reverence and respect. In the night, people used to take in their hands a stick to which a rag dipped in oil was tied which was burnt. It was called 'Mollawaro' ; everyone shouted 'Mollawaro ... . Mollawaro' ... 15\\\\. The Giyaras of Kati Before the independence of Pakistan in 1947, on this day people in Sindh used to be engaged in giving charity. The whole bazaar would be full with hundreds of beggars and the needy, who would spread a cloth before them, on which people, according to their might, would throw money, Bhugra, fruits etc. The jugglers used to arrange their Tamashas on the road with monkeys and bears dancing on the tunes played by the jugglers. An atmosphere of gaiety and gay prevailed all through the day. 16\\\\. Navratra During this days devotees of Devi ate one meal a day and did not even shave and cut hair. Ladies sang bhajans . In Nagarparkar they used to dance like Garba in Gujrat. 17\\\\. Lal LoiLal Loi festival In some parts of Sindh, the Sindhi community celebrated Laal Loi (Lohri) on the 13th of January every year. During Lal Loi kids used to bring wood sticks from their grand parents and aunties and like a fire camp burnt these sticks in the night with people enjoying, dancing and playing around fire. Some ladies whose wishes were fulfilled offered coconuts in the fire and distributed prasad 'Sesa' ; this continued till midnight. 18\\\\. Rakhri During the Purnima of Sawan month, according to Daswani and Parchani (1978) the family priest in Sindh \\"traditionally tied a rakhi on the entire family while the ritual of a sister tying the Rakhi round a brother's wrist has been borrowed as a result of non-Sindhi influence in North India.\\"Chander J. Daswani, S. Parchani (1978) Sociolinguistic Survey of Indian Sindhi. Central Institute of Indian Languages In this festival, sisters tie a Rakhi to their brothers. This day is called \\"Rakhree Bandhan'. People in cities and places near rivers or the sea, used to offer coconuts and milk to the God of Waters 'Varun Devta so that those who were travelling in ships and boats should have a safe and sound journey. 19\\\\. Shraadh Just as in India the month of September 'Bado' was meant for Krishna Paksha as Pitar Pakhiya. Any member of the family who had died on particular (tithi) day and date, a Shraadh was offered for the solace of the deceased's soul. The Brahmins were given food and Dakhshna. It is said that Arya Samaj carried out a strong movement against Shraadh, but the Shraadhs continued because of the faith of people since they felt that through this method the deceased members of the family are remembered and all the family members have a good gathering. 20\\\\. Nagapanchmi (Gogro) During those days whenever the snake charmer brought snakes, they were given some Dakhshna and also milk for the snakes. Nagpanchami is also called Gogro. It is a folklore from Kutch and Gujarat. 21\\\\. Holi The festival of colours in which all the young and old join together to express their joy at the change of season. Some people correlate Holi festival with Holika, the sister of Hirnakashyap, mythological father of Bhagat Prahlad. =Literary festivals= * Sindh Literature Festival * Hyderabad Literary Festival * Sindh Cultural Caravan Recently evolved festivals * Sindhi Cultural Day, Sindhi cultural day is an annual festival celebrated in Sindh by Sindhis and across the world by the Sindhi diaspora References Sindhi festivals Sindhi festivals Sindhi festivals * Sindhi ","title":"List of Sindhi festivals"},{"id":"17367697","text":"John or Jack Angus may refer to: *John Angus (minister) (1724‚Äì1801), English independent minister *John Angus (politician) (born 1943), politician in Manitoba, Canada *John Angus (children's advocate) (1948‚Äì2015) New Zealand historian, social worker and children's advocate *John Angus (footballer, born 1868), Scottish football goalkeeper who played for Everton *John Angus (footballer, born 1938), Burnley and England footballer *Jack Angus (footballer, born 1868) (1868‚Äì1933), Scottish footballer, who played for Ardwick, Southampton and Fulham *Jack Angus (footballer, born 1909) (1909‚Äì1965), English footballer, who played for Exeter City from 1930 to 1948 See also ","title":"John Angus"},{"id":"17367699","text":"The Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) was an initiative of the United Kingdom higher education bodies to promote high quality learning and teaching in all subject disciplines in higher education.

Several trade unionists, including three Englishmen were arrested for organizing an Indian railway strike. The British Government convicted 27 leftist trade union leaders under a false lawsuit. The trial immediately caught attention in England, where it inspired the 1932 play Meerut by Manchester street theatre group the 'Red Megaphones', highlighting the detrimental effects of colonisation and industrialisation.Meerut 1932 play, by Manchester street theatre group the Red Megaphones Working Class Movement Library. Background The British Government was clearly worried about the growing influence of the Communist International. It was also thoroughly convinced that this was all due to the infiltration of communist and socialist ideas propagated to the workers by the Communist Party of India (CPI). Its ultimate objective, so the government perceived, was to achieve \\"complete paralysis and overthrow of existing Governments in every country (including India) by means of a general strike and armed uprising.\\" The government's immediate response was to foist yet another conspiracy case‚Äîthe Meerut Conspiracy Case. In more than one way the Meerut Conspiracy case trial helped the Communist Party of India to consolidate its position among workers. Dange along with 32 persons were arrested on or about 20 March 1929 and were put on trial under Section 121A of the Indian Penal Code, which declares: > Whoever within or without British India conspires to commit any of the > offenses punishable by Section 121 or to deprive the King of the sovereignty > of British India or any part thereof, or conspires to overawe, by means of > criminal force or the show of criminal force, the Government of India or any > local Government, shall be punished with transportation for life,During the > British rule, a severe form of punishment was banishing convicts to a penal > settlement in Andaman Islands. or any shorter term, or with imprisonment of > either description which may extend to ten years. The charges The main charges were that in 1921 S.A. Dange, Shaukat Usmani and Muzaffar Ahmed entered into a conspiracy to establish a branch of the Comintern in India and they were helped by various persons, including the accused Philip Spratt and Benjamin Francis Bradley, sent to India by the Communist International. The aim of the accused persons, according to the charges raised against them was under section 121-A of the Indian Penal Code (Act 45 of 1860) > to deprive the King Emperor of the sovereignty of British India, and for > such purpose to use the methods and carry out the programme and plan of > campaign outlined and ordained by the Communist International. The Sessions Court in Meerut awarded stringent sentences to the accused in January 1933. Out of the accused 27 persons were convicted with various durations of 'transportation'. While Muzaffar Ahmed was transported for life, Dange, Spratt, Ghate, Joglekar and Nimbkar were each awarded transportation for a period of 12 years. On appeal, in August 1933, the sentences of Ahmed, Dange and Usmani were reduced to three yearsIn S.H. Jhabwala And Ors. vs Emperor decided on 3 August 1933 AIR All 690 or 145 Ind Cas 481 http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1416180/ by Sir Shah Sulaiman Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, on the grounds that the accused had already spent a considerable part of their sentence while waiting for the trial to be decided and because > in the case of political offenses, arising out of the beliefs of the > accused, severe sentences defeat their object. In practice such sentences > confirm the offenders in their beliefs and create other offenders, thus > increasing the evil and the danger to the public. Sentences of convicted others were also reduced. The convictions of Desai, Hutchinson, Mitra, Jhabwala, Sehgal, Kasle, Gauri Shankar, Kadara and Alve were also overturned in this appeal. Impact of Meerut Conspiracy Case Though all the accused were not communists, the charges framed against them portrayed the British government's fear for growth of communist ideas in India. In the trial the accused were all labeled as Bolsheviks. During the trial of four and a half years, the defendants turned the courtroom into a public platform to espouse their cause. As a result, the trial saw strengthening of the communist movement in the country. Harkishan Singh Surjeet, a former General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) wrote about the aftermath of the Meerut Conspiracy case thus: > a Party with a centralized apparatus, came into being only after the release > of the Meerut prisoners, in 1933. The Meerut Conspiracy Case, though > launched to suppress the communist movement, provided the opportunity for > Communists to propagate their ideas.

Career Coming from a footballing family, Froggatt started his football career in 1945, whilst in the RAF. Froggatt's uncle, Frank and cousin, Redfern Froggatt both played for Sheffield Wednesday, with the latter racking up 434 games for The Owls. Previously working in his father's butcher shop, the Sheffield-born winger signed for Portsmouth as a centre-half but managed to persuade manager Jack Tinn to play him as an outside-left. Froggatt crowned his Pompey debut in 1945 with a second-half goal at The Dell in a War League South match with South Coast derby rivals Southampton and went on to become a regular goalscorer. He had alarming speed, excellent ball control and was very strong in the air, making him one of the most versatile players Pompey have ever had. A stocky player, who was known for his robust running and sharp shooting, 'Jolly Jack' earned his first cap for England on 6 November 1949, where he scored on his international debut, from the outside- left position in a 9‚Äì2 victory over Northern Ireland at Maine Road. For his Club, Froggatt formed part of the formidable trio with Jimmy Scoular and Jimmy Dickinson, which was often seen as the most powerful half-back line in immediate post-war football as Pompey won consecutive first division titles in 1948‚Äì49 and 1949‚Äì50. With Duggie Reid taking the number 5 shirt in Froggatt's last season, Froggatt reverted to the wing again. Reluctantly leaving in March 1954, the winger went on to play 143 matches for Leicester City, scoring 18 goals. In September 1957 Froggatt went on to sign for Kettering Town for a fee of ¬£6000. Froggatt made his debut at Rockingham Road in November 1957 in the 3‚Äì1 win over Barry Town in front of 3,819, he scored his first goal for the club against Cheltenham Town two weeks later in the home 2‚Äì1 win. During his Poppies career Froggatt scored three hat-tricks, the first in the 6-4 thriller against Spalding United in the 1st Qualifying round of the FA Cup, in October 1958. His second hat-trick was scored in April 1959 in the Southern League North West Division against Kidderminster Harriers as the Poppies ran out 4-3 victors at Rockingham Road during their promotion season. His final trio came against Gloucester City on 15 April 1961 as Kettering ran out a 6‚Äì1 score line in the Southern League Division One, a Championship season as the Poppies returned to the Southern League Premier. Froggatt was the player/manager of the club from January 1958, replacing Harry Mather until September 1961. Under his tenure in the hot seat he saw promotion, a relegation and a Championship season. Froggatt was succeeded by Wally Akers, but he still continued to play for the Poppies. His final league game for the Poppies came in the 1‚Äì3 defeat by Chelmsford City on 23 March 1963. Froggatt's 20-year football career came to an end on 6 May 1963, a benefit match against one of his former clubs, Portsmouth. 1,800 turned out to see Pompey race into a 4‚Äì0 lead after just 35 minutes, before goals from Dennis Randall, Froggatt and George Armour made the score more respectable. Retiring from football, Froggatt returned to Portsmouth to become a publican. For 22 years, he kept the Manor House in Cosham, The Milton Arms near Fratton Park and a hotel in Partridge Green, West Sussex.

It's one of a series of Basque rivers flowing into the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic basin) and is best known for being the river flowing towards the sea by the city of San Sebastian. Course of the river and water data The river is 59.4 km long from its source in the Navarrese municipality of Goizueta, and 33 km of it runs through the province of Gipuzkoa. The average temperature is 13.5 ¬∞C (56.3 ¬∞F). The seasonal and year-to-year variations in water flow are less marked than in other basins of Gipuzkoa, and the natural regulation of this basin is very high. The quality of the water is fairly good, despite a slight deterioration downstream near the mouth (moderately good condition) where the city of Donostia lies. However, lately, works have been done on the treatment and cleaning of water resulting in an outstanding environmental recovery. = Upstream river waves = The mouth of the Urumea river is known for its upstream river wave, which attracts river surfers. The phenomenon looks similar to tidal bores, but it's caused by ocean swells instead of tides. Similar to tidal bores, the waves form in the ocean and travel up the river. Fauna The current water quality allows for a stable fish fauna with five species populating the river, namely salmon (extinct in 1940 and restored thanks to the re-population programs of the 1980s), trout, ezkailu (Phoxinus phoxinus), loach and eel. Basin The lower stretch of the river has wide and flat banks fit for crops and urban development, which has resulted in the most inhabited drainage basin in Gipuzkoa, with 212,564 inhabitants. The main towns on the river are Hernani with its first industrial estates located upstream on its banks (paper and chemical industry, an aluminium mill, lift manufacturing, etc.); Astigarraga, renowned for its cider houses; and Donostia with a final long stretch of the river snaking through different parts of the town. The main focus of cider houses concentrates on a strip along the left bank in Hernani and on a minor road sloping up from the right bank at the limit between Astigarraga and the outer lands of Donostia.

It was the second novel to be published in The Alms for Oblivion sequence and is the fifth novel chronologically. The story takes place in and around London in 1959. Plot summary The story starts in the little town of Menton (April 1959) where Angela Tuck spends some time with the recently widowed con-man Mark Lewson. Lewson, who's waiting for some economic gain, steals 40,000 francs from Angela and is trying to his luck at a casino. After he's lost almost everything he is rescued by professional player Max de Freville and leaves the casino with 100,000 francs. De Freville makes him a proposition. Two of his colleagues, gamblers Stratis Lykiadopolous and Jacques des Moulins, have got hold of an interesting letter since the latter has seduced the son of a minister of Lebanon. This letter proves that the British government (or part of it) planned the Suez crisis together with Israel. Since the two men want to protect the minister's son they‚Äôve hidden the letter. De Freville wants Lewson to steal the letter and he accepts the mission and goes to Venice, where Lykiadopolous lives. During this time, old friends Alistair Dixon and Rupert Percival have a discussion about who is going to succeed the former when he retires as MP for the seat of Bishop's Cross. As things turn out, both Peter Morrison and Somerset Lloyd-James are candidates for selection. Fielding Gray, who has, quite literally, lost his face in a bomb explosion and has retired from the army, sees his old friend Somerset Lloyd-James to ask for work. The always Jesuitical Lloyd-James can‚Äôt see a reason to refuse and will give his old friend some work in the literary field. Gray also meets Tom Llewyllyn, who has become a successful writer. Llewyllyn is soon to be married to Patricia Turbot, the younger daughter of the politician Sir Edwin Turbot. During a party at the Turbot mansion, where Lord Canteloupe is drinking rather heavily, Carton Weir appears to give news about Canteloupe becoming company secretary of British Recreational Resources. Many people around Canteloupe think this is outrageous since they consider him a moron. Mark Lewson is trying to get hold of the letter and succeeds after the son of the minister is killed by a bomb in Paris. Lykiadopolous simply gives it to him since he no longer has any reason to hide it. Lewson also frequents director Burke Lawrence, who is pestered by former model Penelope Holbrook. De Freville tells Lewson to \\"do\\" something about the letter. Lloyd- James manages to kick Robert Constable off the board of Strix on a technicality. He replaces him with Lord Canteloupe. Gregory Stern wants to become publisher for Gray and even print an edited version of his journal, in more literary form. Gray becomes a lodger at Tessie's, who also takes in Jude Holbrook, who hasn‚Äôt been seen in years. Lewson manages to sell the letter to Lloyd-James and the two of them visit Sir Edwin to persuade him to give the party's support to Lloyd-James. Tom and Patricia marry at midsummer and most of the characters attend the wedding. Grey and Morrison meet for the first time since 1955, Salinger is trying to suck up to the rather drunk Lord Canteloupe and even Sir Edwin becomes rather drunk and sentimental. A cigarette causes a fire and the firemen arrive right at the moment when Isobel Turbot and Mark Lewson take off in a sports car. A fireman is killed in the tumult. Lord Canteloupe struggles with a camp site he has constructed called ‚ÄúWestward Ho!‚Äù With the help of Maisie, Jude Holbrook nabs the letter from Lloyd-James. Unknowing, Sir Edwin has made his party support Lloyd-James. De Freville, plagued by mental problems, gives a last scandalous evening of gambling and later tells his friend Captain Detterling about the letter and the many twists the story has taken. A number of persons are now chasing Isobel and Mark (mostly Mark): a group consisting of Morrison, Detterling and Gray; the team Alfie Schroeder and Tom Llewyllyn and also Carlton Weir, sent out by Lloyd-James. Maisie tells Gray about how Holbrook stole the letter from Lloyd-James and after some detective work he finds him hiding at his mother's. Holbrook threatens Gray with acid but the already disfigured Gray isn‚Äôt very afraid and overcomes Holbrook. He is now owner of the letter. At that time, Isobel and Mark arrive at ‚ÄúWestward Ho!‚Äù and try to act like normal campers. By coincidence almost all of the different search parties arrive at the site at the same time. Mark and Isobel, returning with their car, have an accident and Mark dies. While the friendly Stern is comforting the hysterical Isobel the other argues about what to do with the letter. Lord Canteloupe eventually destroys it. This doesn‚Äôt make things easier for Morrison since Sir Edward and the Tories continue to back Lloyd-James, a man they consider easier to handle than the always \\"moral\\" Morrison. Towards the end of the book Tom and Patricia can, at last, have their honeymoon while Stern marries Isobel. In the last scene Angela Tuck (again) and Max de Freville discuss everything that has happened. Characters, in the order of appearance Mark Lewson ‚Äì Con-man and recently widowed.

It was the largest anatomy museum in France. It was closed around 2005, with all its exhibits going into storage. In 2011 the collections were donated to the University of Montpellier and are on display in the Medical School. History The museum dated from 1794 when Honor√© Fragonard, demonstrator and professor of anatomy, collected specimens for the Faculty of Medicine of Paris's new anatomical cabinet. Although the city had contained earlier, amateur collections, including a set of more than 1000 wax anatomical models bequeathed by Jean-Baptiste Sue to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, these earlier collections were dispersed during the French Revolution. The cabinet's anatomical collection was reorganized and vigorously expanded by Mathieu Orfila. Appointed dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris in 1832, Orfila visited the Hunterian Museum and was inspired by its collections of comparative anatomy. In 1844 he established a museum, which in 1847 was formally inaugurated and named the Mus√©e Orfila in his honor. By 1881 it contained nearly 4500 items, as documented in the catalog published by its curator, Charles Nicolas Houel. Unfortunately, during the early 20th century, the museum fell into great disrepair. According to the museum's web site, precious wax models by Laumonier were consumed for lighting, and only a few hundred of Houel's cataloged items still remain. In 1947, however, Prof. Andr√© Delmas began an effort to restore and greatly enlarge the Mus√©e Orfila, conjoining it with the Mus√©e Rouvi√®re, the lymphatic collection of Prof. Henri Rouvi√®re (1876-1952). Since 1953 the museum occupied the vast exhibition halls and galleries of the eighth floor of the Faculty of Medicine. The museum contained about 5,800 human and animal anatomical items. It contained a wide range of anatomical specimens, including a small monkey preserved by Fragonard in 1797; Paul Broca's castings brains of birds, mammals, and humans, including the brains of children, criminals, and representatives of various races, as well as his own brain; showcases of comparative anatomy of reptiles and birds; casts of the heads of criminals executed during the 19th century; a collection of skulls from asylums for the mentally ill; major exhibits of different stages of growth of the skeleton, splanchnology (casts of livers, hearts, lungs, and trachea), and of the viscera and major vessels of the human body; and displays of malformations of the brain caused in rats (Giroud-Delmas), lymph systems (Marie Philibert Constant Sappey), kidney structure (Augier), trachea (Eralp), esophagus (Sussini), and liver. It also included the Spitzner collection, a famous set of anatomical wax models dating from the 19th Century.

It was built as a military air base by the Luftwaffe following the German occupation of Norway in April 1940. It was gradually expanded so that it by 1943 consisted of three runways, the longest . The airfield was connected by a taxiway to Sola Air Station. The airport served as an offensive base during the Battle of Britain, and was afterwards made part of the defensive Festung Norwegen. The hangars saw a limited use after the end of World War II. From 1966 it was taken into use by Helikopter Service, who operated their offshore helicopter services out of Forus to the Ekofisk and Frigg platforms in the North Sea. The heliport saw a major upgrade in 1977, but was after long discussions and delays moved to Stavanger Airport, Sola in 1989. The area has since been redeveloped into a combination of industry and office buildings. History =World War II= During the early planning in 1933 of the construction of Stavanger Airport, Sola, the location at Stokkavassbot at Forus had been proposed as a suitable site for an airport, but was discarded in relation to Sola.Eggeb√∏: 45 By 1940, Sola was one of three airfields in Norway.Eggeb√∏: 46 On 3 April 1940, five days before the German occupation of Norway set in, a German Junkers Ju 88 bomber flew over the area and made a forced landing on a field in the area.Eggeb√∏: 44 Before the police were able to apprehend the four airmen, they had set ablaze their aircraft. The aircraft had been shot down by the Royal Navy in the North Sea and had been allowed to land in Norway because of its neutrality. On 9 April, Sola was captured by 132 German paratroopers, allowing three hundred aircraft to be stationed there. However, the Luftwaffe was concerned about the concentration of the aircraft, as they would be vulnerable for just a single, successful bombing raid. They therefore intended to spread the aircraft over a larger area. Sola, in combination with Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik, was of vital importance for two strategic concerns: controlling Skagerrak, and for a planned invasion of the British Isles. The Germans had developed extensive military plans existed, with possibilities of it expanded towards Forus and a maximum extension to seven runways, of which four would be located in the Forus area. The longest of these was planned to be long. Construction commenced immediately after the invasion had set foot. The Wehrmacht had set a deadline of 15 August for the expansion to be completed, in time for the Battle of Britain to commence. Luftflotte 5 had a group at the airbase.Eggeb√∏: 47 From 10 April the Luftwaffe needed fifty men for painting, which a contractor in Stavanger was willing to carry out. Gradually the need for a workforce increased as the construction continued. Requisition of the land necessary took place on 19 April, when 3,000 people and 6,000 animals were chased from their homes. Work at Forus commenced on 21 April, originally by putting 350 Norwegian prisoners of war to work, in violation with the Hague Convention. The Wehrmacht initially demanded a workforce of 2,000, which was largely gathered through coercion.Eggeb√∏: 51 A force of 65 Heinkel He 111s participated from Sola and Kjevik in the raid on Britain, but it was so unsuccessful that Luftflotte 5 would no longer play a role in attacks on Britain. The Wehrmacht gave up on its original plan on 15 September, which also changed the anticipated role for Sola and Forus. The importance of Sola and Forus thus became the need to defend from British attacks, rather than offense. Forus became part of Festung Stavanger‚Äîa heavy construction of defensive structures in J√¶ren‚Äîwhich played a key role in Festung Norwegen. This massive endeavor created a surge in the demand for labor, while the wartime halt to commerce escalated unemployment. Construction was therefore typically carried out by Norwegians, partially voluntary, partially out of dire hunger and partially by force.Eggeb√∏: 50 After the war progressed, work was gradually taken more over by Russian prisoners of war.Eggeb√∏: 55 Organisation Todt was the central contractor of the works, although they subcontracted much of the work to Norwegian companies. Initially a concrete runway was built at Forus. The need for labor increased steadily, and eventually reached 6,000 men. The road between Sola and Sande was closed because it came in the way of the runway, forcing the Germans to build a new connection road.Eggeb√∏: 58 Most of the hangars were completed in 1941.Eggeb√∏: 62 Work on L√∏venstrasse, which connected Forus to Sola, commenced in 1943.Eggeb√∏: 59 Three runways were completed by 1944. =Military interlude= The day following the German surrender on 8 May 1945, Allied aircraft landed and took control over Forus and Sola. At the time there were twenty-six German aircraft at Forus, which included eight Arado Ar 234 jet bombers and fourteen Messerschmitt Bf 108 utility planes. All but two of the German aircraft were destroyed and buried in a dump near the airport.Eggeb√∏: 69 Later that year the airport was taken over by the Directorate for Enemy Property. Most inventory was gradually sold, until the facility was taken over by the state in 1947.Eggeb√∏: 70 After the war ended there was a discussion as to what Stavanger's two airports should be used for. A government proposition from 1947 called for Sola to be converted to a civilian airport and Forus to become a military air station. Parliament supported the notion on 12 December and granted NOK 1 million for construction to start on 1 February 1948. However, the infrastructure at Forus was in worse condition than the authorities had anticipated. In violation with the parliamentary legislation, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Transport and Communications struck a deal on 22 May, whereby both the military and civilian operations would be located at Sola. However, a limited amount of repairs were carried out at Forus for another year.Eggeb√∏: 71 The airport's value was estimated at NOK 20 million. A sabotage of the drainage system was discovered in 1949, which explained many of the technical challenges affiliated with the runways. This was decisive in putting off the military desire to hang on to the facility. Sola Air Station took the three large hangars and a barracks into use, while the rest of the airfield was decommissioned. A NOK 6.7 million estimate to bring the airport back into shape was found to be not worth the cost. After the war the Royal Norwegian Air Force considered using Forus as an air station. In 1959 and 1960 the military carried out an extensive renovation of the runway, mainly intended to make it more level. Holes were drilled at suitable places and a mixture of concrete, sand and earth was injected to get the concrete blocks to rise in the desired locations. In addition, the cracks between the blocks were cleaned and filled with asphalt. Of the 88 mines which had been built into the runway, 86 were removed in 1961. The last two had to be blown up. Shortly after the renovations were completed, the military decided that it did not want to use the airfield.Eggeb√∏: 53 L√∏venstrasse was converted to a public road in 1959 and 1960, which cost 400,000 Norwegian krone. It is today largely part of National Road 44. Part of the road was named Forusbeen in 1984. =Civilian operations= Esso Exploration Norway was in 1966 granted permission to search for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf southwest of Stavanger, in what became known as Ekofisk. Helikopter Service was contracted to fly crew to their rig, Ocean Traveller, and bought two Sikorsky S-61N helicopters to carry out the job.Bj√∏rhovde: 70 Helikopter Service made Forus its main base, signing agreement with the Ministry of Defense to lease the grounds, which remained owned by the state.Thoring: 61 Helikopter Service invested NOK 20 million in the two helicopters, as well as NOK 15 million in the airport. It took over one of the large hangars at Godeset as well as a number of smaller buildings left over from the war.Eggeb√∏: 60 The first flight took off on 18 July 1966. The company flew 250 hours out of Forus in the first year of operation, although this increased to 4,500 hours in 1972. By 1975 the company had built a complex at the airport.Thoring: 62 The government and local authorities decided in 1975 that Forus was to become a business district for the booming oil industry. A plot of of military land at Forus was therefore sold to Forus Industritomtselskap that year.Thoring: 64 At the same time Helikopter Service asked for negotiations with the state so they could purchase a sufficient lot to continue operations at Forus. This was met with local protests, including from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, who stated it was too close to the highway, and from companies planning to establish themselves at Forus. Most of the complaints were directed at noise pollution. The following negotiations included four ministries and various government agencies. The main concern regarding an establishment at Sola was that it did not have sufficient space for a heliport. Stavanger City Council supported a continuation at Forus at its meeting on 1 December 1975. Helikopter Service signed an agreement with Forus Industritomtselskap in January 1976 for the purchase of of land. A new highway would cut their old premises in two and were therefore forced to build an all-new facility. Local protests endured and the city decided in 1977 to not approve the zoning plan. Negotiations were carried out by the Ministry of Transport, where at a meeting on 15 March 1977 a compromise was reached. Helikopter Service would build a terminal would could easily be converted to an industrial facility and this would be sold to Forus Industritomtselskap at an undecided point in the future. The airport would only receive operating permissions for a period of three years and the helicopter company would have to move to Sola at an undetermined future date.Thoring: 63 The new terminal was taken into use on 11 January 1978, with the new facilities having cost NOK 33 million. By 1981 the investments had increased to NOK 50 million.Eggeb√∏: 72 The government extended the operating permit to 1 July 1982 on 26 June 1980. A new heliport was being planned at Sola, but constant delays caused Forus to remain in use and gradually extensions of the operating permit. Helikopter Service therefore remained at Forus until 1989. Facilities L√∏wenstrasse has been converted to County Road 349, but still bears the old name Part of the former taxiway now converted to the road Forusbeen =Luftwaffe= The airport was located in the Forus area, which is at the intersection of three municipalities: Stavanger, Sandnes and Sola.\\"Forus flyplass\\" in Stavanger byleksikon: 175 The site is that of a former lake, Stokkavatnet, which had been drained to create agricultural land.\\"Stokkavatn (Forus)\\" in Stavanger byleksikon: 512 The Luftwaffe facilities at Forus consisted of three runways. The main one measured and aligned southeast‚Äìnorthwest. It was crossed, not quite at a right angle at its southern end by a runway dimensioned . Another ran east‚Äìwest and measured and crossed the main runway at the northern end. Forus was connected to Sola by way of a taxiway, named L√∏wenstrasse, allowing Forus and Sola to exchange aircraft. It connected to the main runway at the south To increase the airport's defensive position, the hangars were spread around the Sola, Forus and J√•tt√• area. Some farms had as many as eight hangars on their property. Most were simple constructions in non-reinforced concrete, typically with three walls and camouflage netting on the fourth side. Taxiways were normally built of wood. The three largest hangars were built at Godeset, two measuring and one . The Luftwaffe placed a series of dummy aircraft in suitable locations.Eggeb√∏: 61 The Luftwaffe built a series of other buildings and structures at the airfield. The largest non-hangar was known as the canteen and measured , including a hall. The buildings were collected in two main clusters, one around the large hangars and one around the canteen. The airfield was surrounded by an extensive network of anti-aircraft guns.Eggeb√∏: 64 Forus had several factors which contributed to difficult aviation conditions and accidents. The runways were not well-leveled, in part because of poor workmanship and in part because of soft soil. The area had poor lift and was often covered in fog, and the area experienced difficult wind conditions and air pockets. Hard landings and runway overruns were commonplace. =Heliport= During the period Helikopter Service operated at Forus, the company had a monopoly on offshore helicopter flights.

Traditionally, woodcraft pertains to subsistence lifestyles, with implications of hunting-gathering. In more recent times, and in developed countries, it relates more to either outdoor recreationalism or survivalism. Techniques A partial list of recreational woodcraft techniques might include knowledge of wildlife behavior, identifying and utilizing wild plants and animals (especially for food), camp cooking, orienteering (including hiking skills and use of a map and compass), fire making (including procurement of firewood), selecting and preparing a campsite, lashing and knot techniques, the use of tents and wilderness first aid. Contexts and significance The Scouting movement has adopted woodcraft techniques as a core skill set known as scoutcraft. In the United States, woodcraft techniques in a military context are taught as part of SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) training. Traditional woodcraft has particular importance in American folklore, especially that relating to the early American frontier. In the UK, the Woodcraft Folk are an organisation founded on the principles of woodcraft.

These trichomes (hairs) are orange-brown in colour, hence the name \\"rustyback\\". The petiole is shorter than the corpus of the leaf. This species is found in Western and Central Europe, including the Mediterranean region. It is associated with fissures in carbonate rocks and also grows on the mortar of stone and brick walls. This fern species has been used medicinally as a diuretic.  Traditional uses  It has been widely used for making infusions as a diuretic.  Growing conditions  It likes growing in rocky walls, especially in alkaline ones. Can be found growing up to 2700 metres above the sea level, although it prefers mountainous locations, where it is usually found growing in sunny rocky walls and slopes. Unlike many others, this fern likes growing in full sun, and requires little, if any, humidity.  Desiccation tolerance  This fern is well known as a resurrection plant due to its ability to withstand desiccation and subsequently recover on rewetting. It has been shown that this is in part due to its high concentrations of phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid which allow it to negate the destructive capacity of the reactive oxygen species generated by the drying process; the concentrations of these phenols decrease during the dehydration process. Enzymes such as peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase have also been shown to be important in allowing this fern to cope with desiccation; the concentrations of these enzymes increase when the fern is subjected to water shortages.

Operated between 1986 and 1990, it had an asphalt runway aligned 07‚Äì25. The airport was owned and operated by the V√¶r√∏y Municipality. It was served by Wider√∏e, who operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft to the town of Bod√∏ and the nearby island of R√∏stlandet. After a fatal accident in 1990, the airport was shut down. Wider√∏e commenced seaplane operates to V√¶r√∏y from 1965; five years later the first helicopter services were introduced. Planning of an airport started in the late 1960s, but unfavorable weather conditions prolonged finding a suitable location. The decision to build the airport was taken in 1984, construction began the following year and the airport opened on 1 June 1986. The fatal Wider√∏e Flight 839 accident took place on 12 April 1990, in which heavy wind caused structural failure of a Twin Otter. The airport has been closed since; helicopter services commenced in 1993 and V√¶r√∏y Heliport opened in 1997. History =Early aviation= The first aircraft to land in V√¶r√∏y was a Noorduyn Norseman of the Royal Norwegian Air Force in 1948. Services to V√¶r√∏y started in 1965, when Wider√∏e commenced sea plane services to the island using de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters and Norseman aircraft. The routes were operated two to three times per week as a charter service, with subsidies from the municipalities of V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st. At V√¶r√∏y the airline parked the aircraft in S√∏rlandsv√•gen and rowed passengers to and from land with a rowboat. Ragnar Johansen's Cessna was a frequent operator to V√¶r√∏y for charter services. Helikopter Service flew between Bod√∏ Airport to V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st‚Äîthe island community further out from V√¶r√∏y‚Äîwith three weekly services from 1973. The helicopters doubled as serving for search and rescue duty; in case they were needed for the latter flights to V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st were cancelled. The regional airports in Lofoten and Vester√•len opened in 1972, with the V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st service being taken over by Wider√∏e on 1 September 1973. As they did not want to operate helicopters, they subcontracted the operations to Helilift. The service operated twice per day on weekdays and once per day in the weekends, using two sixteen-seat Sikorsky S-58Ts. Subsidies of 1.9 million Norwegian krone (NOK) was granted for the route in 1973, and the service transported 5,359 passengers (from both R√∏st and V√¶r√∏y).Arnesen, 1984: 124‚Äì125 At V√¶r√∏y the helicopters landed at Hanna Bakken-jordet in S√∏rland. One of the helicopters was bought by Wider√∏e in December 1976 and the operations were subcontracted to Offshore Helicopters. The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore Helicopters. Helikopter Service merged with Offshore Helicopters in 1980, and the new Helikopter Service took over the route.Arnesen, 1984: 134 They introduced an eleven-seat Bell 212 helicopters from 1 January 1982 because of the high maintenance costs of the S-58Ts. In 1982 the service to both islands handled 7,145 passengers and three tonnes of post and cargo, and made 744 landings. It received subsidies for NOK 4 million.Arnesen, 1984: 140 =Establishment= The first proposals for an airport on V√¶r√∏ya were launched by the government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, R√∏ssnesv√•gen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from R√∏st caused V√¶r√∏y politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Wider√∏e was opposed to the location of the airport. Planning of the airport ran parallel with five other regional airports: Fagernes Airport, Leirin; F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland; Mosj√∏en Airport, Kj√¶rstad; R√∏rvik Airport, Ryum and R√∏st Airport. Construction was approved by the Parliament of Norway on 10 April 1984 and construction began in 1985. The municipality was granted concession to operate the airport on 22 August 1985. V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st Airports were opened on 1 June 1986, after had been spent on constructing V√¶r√∏y Airport. =Operational history= V√¶r√∏y Airport was plagued by bad wind conditions and low regularity. The airport had the highest number of cancellations in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation. During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety, more runway lights were installed and an anemometer was installed on the mountain, costing . Wider√∏e introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at V√¶r√∏y from 31 October 1988. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090¬∞‚Äì240¬∞ (through south) if the wind speed exceeded , including gusts. Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 36‚Äì38 On 12 April 1990, Wider√∏e Flight 839 crashed one minute after take-off, killing all five on board. The cause of the accident was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 59 The airport was immediately closed after the incident; no public flights have taken off from the Airport after Flight 839. Private flights still use the airport on occasion. The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided on 17 January 1992 to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. This made V√¶r√∏y Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time. Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights on 1 January 1993. Construction of a new heliport started in 1996 and V√¶r√∏y Heliport opened on 15 February 1997. The old airport was in 2000 bought by a private individual who converted the terminal building into a private dwelling and used the control tower for a small-scale chocolate factory. The chocolate factory burned down on 8 October 2015, and the owner announced that the factory would be permanently moved to another location. Facilities The airport is located at Nordland on the north side of the island of V√¶r√∏ya. It is located on level section of land; just south of the runway is the tall mountain Teisthammeren.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 24 The asphalt runway measured and was aligned 07‚Äì25.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 25 The terminal building had a caf√© and was connected to the rest of the island with a dirt road. Airlines and destinations On present days, there is no scheduled flights to/from the airport. But the airport was served by Wider√∏e using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter in the past. The airline operated two trips Bod√∏‚ÄìR√∏st‚ÄìV√¶r√∏y‚ÄìBod√∏ on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, there were two weekly trips that connected V√¶r√∏y to Leknes Airport before returning to Bod√∏. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Accidents and incidents On 19 January 1989, a Wider√∏e Twin Otter became uncontrollable due to turbulence during final approach to V√¶r√∏y. Control was regained when there was height above the sea. This incident caused the airport to be temporarily closed. On 12 April 1990, Wider√∏e Flight 839 crashed one minute after take-off, killing all five on board. The accident was caused by high wind speeds that exceeded the plane's structural tolerance, causing the tail rudder and vertical stabilizer to crack, and the plane to crash in the sea after eight seconds.

Career Blom began his acting career in 1893 in Kolding, and was employed as a company actor for the Folketeatret from 1907 to 1910. During that period, Blom also began performing in films for the Nordisk Film Kompangni. He debuted there as a director in 1910 with his film Livets Storme (Storms of Life). That same year he was made the Head of Production for Nordisk Film and given the title of Director. Blom was a prolific filmmaker and during the golden age of Danish silent films, 1910 to 1914, he directed 78 movies. Before he retired from Nordisk Film and filmmaking in 1925, Blom directed more than 100 titles. Blom's volume of work is the largest of any Danish film director. Blom is credited as a pioneer in silent filmmaking.Monty, Ib, August Blom, Online Film Reference Library, Retrieved 2008-05-26 In 1911, Blom was instrumental in the development of the erotic melodrama with his film Ved Faengslets Port, the story of a young man in debt to a moneylender while in love with the moneylender's daughter. Blom refined this genre during the following years, and this became the most profitable trademark for Nordisk company films. Blom also is credited with developing the use of cross-cutting as well as using mirrors to expand the drama. In 1913, Blom made his most ambitious effort: the film Atlantis based on the 1912 novel by Gerhart Hauptmann. The film, which depicted the sinking of an ocean liner only one year after the sinking the RMS Titanic, drew an enormous public response. With a complicated plot and several main characters, Atlantis became the first multi-reel feature film from Denmark. Harald Engberg of the Politiken newspaper later wrote in an obituary that Blom \\"knew that he wasn't some directorial genius, but he proved that he was the cleverest and most tasteful scene creator of his day.\\" Blom retired from filmmaking in 1924. He opened the Kinografen movie theater (later renamed the Bristol Theater) and managed the theater from 1934 to 1947. Personal life August Blom was born on 26 December 1869 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Blom was first married at the age of 39 in 1908 to Agnete von Prangen. After they divorced, he married a second time in 1917 to the actress Johanne Fritz-Petersen, the widow of Theater Director Fritz Petersen., Danmarks Nationalfilmografi, Danish Film Institute He died on 10 January 1947, aged 77.

There is one school located in Emmons School District 33, which serves all grades from kindergarten to eight, and encompasses a kindergarten program: it is known as Emmons Grade School, alternatively known as Emmons Elementary School or simply Emmons School.Emmons School Building Photograph on Main Site, retrieved 2008-5-11 The principal/superintendent as of September 2019 is Mrs. Janean Friedman; the mascot of the school and district is the raider. History Established in 1844 as a subscription school, the first Emmons School was located on what is now the southeast corner of Beach Grove Road and Route 59 (once known as Grass Lake Road). Myron Emmons (1805‚Äì1893) who had migrated to Antioch two years before from Caughdenoy, New York, settled on a farm of 440 acres. Myron donated a portion of his farm for the schoolhouse. Myron resided on his farm until 1868 when he moved into the village of Antioch and went into partnership in a general store with his eldest son, Rockwell Dean. A letter written by Myron in 1878 tells of his trip to California in 1850 and his return with $500 in gold dust. Myron remained in the general store business until he retired in 1887. The first Emmons School was made of lathe and plaster and the oak lumber donated by each family. It measured 16 x 24 feet and was heated by a box stove, which could accommodate logs three feet in length. The desks were boards on the side walls and one end wall of the room and the seats were planks with legs. There was no school tax at the time so each family gave money according to the number of their children that were pupils. The first teacher Mr. Miller, the second, Mr. White and others that followed boarded with the half dozen or so families in the district. The length of the teacher's stay with a family was determined by the number of children that family had enrolled in the school. The teachers were paid twelve dollars a month. It was determined that the Emmons land was too low, so in 1870 land for a new site was purchased from John and Josephine Grimm for twenty dollars. The schoolhouse was moved to the new site directly across the road from where it had been originally built. The schoolhouse door faced west with several windows on the south wall. The Emmons land was returned to the Emmons family. Prior to the turn of the century Emmons was District 7 of the 11 school districts in the Antioch area. Each school had three directors that managed school business. By 1905 the schools in the county were reorganized and Emmons was given the district number 33. In the early 1900s enrollment varied from 20 to as many as 37 students. The building was remodeled in 1916 at a cost of $900, yet was not considered a standard school. The heating and drinking water system were far below the necessary requirements . Since there was no well on the grounds during the 1920s, the teacher, Ida (Runyard) Kufalk, carried water from her parents' farm across the road (northwest corner of Beach Grove and Route 59). The teacher was also responsible for starting the fire in the morning. Ida's student, Ardis (Toft) Pedersen remembers the odor of the chemical toilets in restrooms on the east end of the building. Teachers in the 1920s needed to have one year of college to teach in a country school like Emmons, or two years to teach in a city school. Louise (Sheehan) McClure's salary was $125 a month. Two days a year the teacher was permitted to visit other school programs in the county. The community also used the Emmons schoolhouse. Church services, lyceums, political meetings, box socials, and square dancing all took place in the school or on the school grounds. During the summer of 1934 a new brick schoolhouse was built on the site. The superintendent at that time was W. C. Petty and the directors were E. P. Dressel, T. E. Hanson, and P. C. Toft. That brick structure had an oil furnace, boys and girls cloakrooms, indoor flush toilets, a library and a teacher's room. The basement of the build was used for indoor play. The former frame structure was sold and moved to the Nielsen Corner (northwest corner of Grass Lake Rd and Route 59) and became part of their restaurant. Emmons remained a one-teacher school into the 1950s. In the early 1950s there were only eight students in the school. There was a proposal to close the school and send the students to attend school in Antioch. Members of the community were so strongly opposed to the idea that the school remained open. In 1954 from the close of school in the spring until it reopened in the fall the enrollment grew from twenty-four to forty-eight students. A second teacher was hired. Mrs. Helen Wolfinbarger, principal, taught the 5th - 8th grade students downstairs in the basement and the 1st - 4th grades were upstairs with Mrs. Cohnen as their teacher. By 1956 Emmons was over-crowded and the 7th and 8th grade students did attend school in Antioch while the first addition was being built. The new addition provided three classrooms and two restrooms on the main floor and a basement area that had a stage for student plays and graduation. Later in 1967 another addition was built with three more classrooms, office space and a gymnasium. Classrooms were also built on the basement level. By 1990 thirteen classrooms were in use in the school. In 1970 the district had 1000 or more voters and could elect its first school board of seven members. The members of the first six-member board were Alan Thain, Ruth Duha, Richard Dubek, Harold Wilson, Dan Maras, and Richard Ruck. When school opened for the 1994-1995 school year Emmons enrollment was 303 students. Ground was broken for a fourteen-room addition during the summer of 1994. The cost of the addition was 1.5 million. Teachers and students were able to move into the classrooms in that addition in May 1995. The one room brick schoolhouse built in 1934 remains in use as the kindergarten classroom. Present day Emmons consists of merely 300 students. The teachers at Emmons School pay individual attention to every student to help them proceed to the next grade comfortably. This school has the means of a private school.

The ancestors of the family left Apulia (Italy) for Hungary during the reign of King Charles I. Several members of the family held high offices in the first half of the 14th century and later, when the Drugeth estates were the largest in all of Hungary.Paul Robert Magocsi, Ivan Pop. Encyclopaedia of Rusyn History and Culture. University of Toronto Press, 2002. . Page 99. The family continued to be important until the male line died out in 1691. Notable members of the family The first member of the family establishing himself in the Kingdom of Hungary was Philip Druget () ( 1288‚Äì1327) who accompanied the future King Charles I from the Kingdom of Naples to Hungary in 1300. He took part in the king's military campaigns against his opponents and the rebelling aristocrats. He led the king's armies, in 1317, against the rebellious Peter, son of Petenye (who possessed several castles in Zempl√©n county) and in 1320, against Matthew III Cs√°k. He was the head (isp√°n) of the Counties Szepes (1315‚Äì1327), Aba√∫j (1317‚Äì1327), G√∂m√∂r and Torna (1320‚Äì1327). Philipp was the Master of the Queen's Treasury (kir√°lyn√©i t√°rnokmester) between 1321 and 1327, when King Charles appointed him to Palatine (n√°dor); he hold the latter office until his death. King Charles granted him the possession of the Castles Bark√≥ (), Jeszen≈ë (), Lubl√≥ (), Palocsa (), Szokoly () and Terebes (). Nevickei Castle in modern-day Ukraine was the property of the Drugeth family. Philip's brother, John Drugeth () (?-1334) arrived from the Kingdom of Naples to Hungary before Philip's death. King Charles I appointed him to Palatine in 1328. He was also the head of the Counties B√°cs (1330‚Äì1333), Fej√©r, Somogy, Tolna, Ung and Zempl√©n (1328‚Äì1333) and castellan of √ìbuda (1328). The king granted him the Nevicke Castle in 1332. In 1333, he returned to Naples. Palatine John's elder son, William Drugeth () (?‚Äì1342) was the most powerful member of the family. He followed his uncle, Philip in his offices in 1327, and became the head of the Counties Aba√∫j, G√∂m√∂r and Szepes, (1327‚Äì1342); and he also was the isp√°n of the Counties Borsod, Heves (1327‚Äì1342) and S√°ros (1328‚Äì1342). He inherited his uncle's possessions on the north-eastern parts of the kingdom where he had the Dunajec Castle built before 1333. Around 1330, he acquired the Castle of Szal√°nc (). When his father left for Naples in 1333, William became his deputy as Palatine, and followed him as the head of the Counties Ung and Zempl√©n (1333‚Äì1342). Following his father's death in 1334, William was appointed to Palatine. In 1340, he led the armies King Charles I sent to Poland in order to assist King Casimir III of Poland. In his last will, he left his possessions to his brother, Nicholas, but King Louis I of Hungary confiscated them upon the request of his mother, the Queen Dowager Elisabeth. Palatine John's second son, Nicholas Drugeth de Gerg√©ny () (?‚Äì1355) was appointed to Master of the Cup-bearers (poh√°rnokmester) in 1332 and he became the head of Ugocsa County in 1337. When his brother, William died in 1342, King Louis I not only confiscated him of the inheritance, but also removed Nicholas from his offices. However, he regained the king's favor soon who granted Bark√≥ and Nevicke jointly to Nicholas and his brother, John from William's legacy in 1343. In the same year, Nicholas became the head of the Ung County (1343‚Äì1354). Nicholas was appointed judge royal (orsz√°gb√≠r√≥) (and he became also the isp√°n of Tur√≥c County) in 1354, and thus held the third office of the kingdom in his last year. The branch \\"Ger√©nyi\\" of the Drugeth family ascended from him, but its male line died out already in the third generation. Palatine John's third son, John Drugeth de Homonna () (?‚Äì1361) founded the \\"Homonnai\\" branch of the family in what is today the town of Humenn√© in Slovakia. In 1343, he was granted the possession of Bark√≥ and Nevicke jointly with his younger brother, Nicholas. John followed Nicholas as head of the Ung County (1354‚Äì1362).

Life Maria was inducted in the convent of Unter-Zell in Bavaria in 1699, where she made herself known for her great piety and was appointed Sub Prioress in 1740. In 1746, one of the nuns, Cecilia, became afflicted with convulsions and claimed to be possessed by demons and poltergeists. The attacks spread through the convent and soon several nuns suffered from hysteric attacks. One of them died, after which Renata was pointed out as a satanist and a magician. The church then conducted an exorcism at the convent, during which the nuns rolled on the ground and \\"howled and snapped like mad cats.\\" During a search in Renata's room, poisons, ointments, and strange robes were found. Renata confessed to a Benedictine confessor that she was a satanist and a witch; that in 1687, at the age of seven, she had sworn herself to Satan; at twelve, had become a prostitute and learned magic and to mix poisons; in 1694, Maria was baptized at a black mass; and in 1699, had entered the nunnery entirely to make strife amongst the \\"brides of Christ.\\" She claimed to be a skilled chemist and preferred the poison Aqua Tofana developed by Giulia Tofana in Naples. She said she was remorseful, but the church still judged her guilty of sorcery, heresy, witchcraft, apostasy, and satanism, then turned her over to the secular authorities to be executed. She was beheaded and then burned in June 1749. Legacy Sister Maria was an elderly member of the lower nobility and the holy orders, ensconced in a prominent cloister. Her trial for witchcraft and subsequent execution was a scandal throughout Germany and Northern Italy. The academic debates it occasioned‚Äîargued among Abbot Tartarotti, Scipione Maffei, Count Carli and others‚Äîeventually prompted the end of witchcraft as a legal matter.

As a non-profit organisation, MERCY Malaysia relies solely on funding and donations from organisations and generous individuals to continue their services to provide humanitarian assistance to beneficiaries, both in Malaysia and abroad. The organisation is a registered society according to the Societies Act 1966 in Malaysia, and the headquarters is in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. History =The Early Years (1999‚Äì2003)= MERCY Malaysia was founded by Dr Jemilah Mahmood in 1999 in response to the conflict in Kosovo. Finding no pre-existing organisation that could sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there, she and a group of friends registered MERCY Malaysia with the Registrar of Societies with the objective of providing medical relief.Transnational activism in Asia: problems of power and democracy By Nicola Piper, Anders Uhlin, p133 Working with Helping Hands USA, MERCY Malaysia then sent a total of five missions to Kosova to provide mobile medical care. That same year, MERCY Malaysia sent relief teams to Turkey in response to the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake. In 2000, MERCY Malaysia provided medical assistance to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) due to the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia. 2001 saw the organisation responding to the medical needs of the survivors of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.

While MERCY Malaysia has asserted its apolitical stand, it was clear that public interest in Afghanistan grew after September 11 and humanitarian concerns increased after the US War on terror commenced. MERCY Malaysia partnered with Pakistan Islamic Medical Association for the Afghanistan response, while the Cambodian response was funded from MERCY Malaysia's own reserves and private sector donations. In 2002, MERCY Malaysia continued its presence in Kabul,12th mission to Kabul and later expanded its operations in Afghanistan to run the only medical centre in Spin Boldak,Succour to the needy in Spin Buldak an area located approximately 100 km away from Kandahar.

Suddenly, people realised there was MERCY Malaysia,\\" Dr Jemilah said. MERCY Malaysia deployed teams to AcehMercy Malaysia team for Aceh and Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka welcomes help from Malaysians as well as assisting the tsunami survivors on the home front in Penang, Malaysia.Mercy sends team to Penang =A Period of Rapid Growth (2005‚Äì2007)= 2005: The Aftermath of the Tsunami, and Coping with Other Disasters The earlier part of 2005 was occupied with the humanitarian response due to the tsunami, and MERCY Malaysia readily admitted that the scale of the disaster had stretched their operations to the limits.Mercy team stretched to the limit in Aceh Public support was overwhelming, and donations flowed in the form of financial assistance as well as donations in-kind such as body bagsSocial worker close to target of getting 20,000 body bags and clothes. In-kind donations became unmanageable at one point when irrelevant and unusable items were donated, and MERCY Malaysia had to appeal to the public not to look at the organisation as a dumping ground for unwanted goods.‚ÄòDonors‚Äô using centres as dumping grounds As part of the reconstruction effort for the tsunami survivors, the organisation provided seismic-resistant homes for the refugees from Kampong Weu Raya and Sebun Ayu in Lhok Nga,Mercy Malaysia to provide earthquake-proof houses as well as rebuilding the Meuraxa Community Health Centre in Banda Aceh.Mercy to rebuild hub The rebuilding of the houses for the people of Kampong Weu Raya proved to be a good learning experience for the organisation. Identifying actual boundaries was a difficult task, as surviving villagers had to delineate the plots of land where their houses used to be.A new beginning in Aceh Once construction started, the team of 30 skilled villagers and 180 construction workers from Medan managed to build at a rate of one house a day, using shorea wood and concrete. Originally designed to be 36 square metres, each unit was later expanded to 52 square metres. Discontentment arose among some of the villagers who wanted brick houses or different designs given by other NGOs. As the village was rebuilt on its original site ‚Äì about 20 minutes from the Banda Aceh city centre in the north-west coastal area ‚Äì it remained vulnerable to future disasters. Preparedness measures were needed, and a tsunami escape route was designed to guide the villagers towards the quickest paths to safer, higher grounds. A book was launched in 2005, entitled \\"A Time To Heal: A Reflection of Mercy Malaysia's Response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami\\"\\"A Time To Heal: A Reflection of Mercy Malaysia's Response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami\\" to commemorate the disaster that struck on 26 December 2004. The coffee-table book relates the experiences of MERCY Malaysia's relief workers in Malaysia, Indonesia's Aceh province and Sri Lanka.

In 2017-2018, MERCY Malaysia is in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh for emergency response and also manage to set up Mothers and Child Health Center (MCHC) in the Rohingya refugee camps. =2020 Covid-19 Pandemic Response in Malaysia= In 2020 MERCY Malaysia launched its Covid-19 Pandemic Fund to support medical services and the essential needs of marginalised groups within the country. This dedicated fund is to implement the Covid-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan ‚Äì a plan for humanitarian assistance to be delivered within a continuous cycle of total disaster risk management that focuses on prevention; preparedness; response; and recovery. All aid assistance and deliverables are coordinated with Ministry of Health (Malaysia) and the National Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (CPRC), and the National Agency for Disaster Management (NADMA). MERCY Malaysia received RM4 mil from Maybank and another RM10mil from 11 member banks of the Association of Banks in Malaysia (ABM) for its Pandemic Fund. Costa Coffee donated RM6000 to purchase equipment to ensure supplies are available to communities currently facing difficulties getting fresh food caused by the restricted movement. Together with two other NGOs, MERCY Malaysia also partnered with Lazada Malaysia to facilitate the donation of funds through digital giving. A national Covid-19 psychosocial support hotline was initially set up by MERCY Malaysia and CPRC and subsequently linked to the Women's Aid Organisation‚Äôs (WAO) domestic violence hotline. WAO's 14 active crisis support officers and additional staff complemented the 19 psychosocial volunteers from MERCY Malaysia and 10 counsellors from the Health Ministry who were operating the hotline, in anticipation of the increase in the number of calls received as many at-risk women and children find themselves confined in the same houses as perpetrators, unable to work or go to school during the 2020 Malaysia movement control order. It was reported that 46.8 percent of the calls were psychologically-related, as people began to be retrenched due to the pandemic and economic stresses translates to poor mental health. MERCY Malaysia also had to reassure the stateless people from the Rohingya community to come forward for testing as they fear arrests from authorities upon seeking medical attention. There was an increase in animosity from the public towards the community and there were online petitions calling for the deportation of Rohingya people and for Myanmar to take up responsibility for their welfare. In addition to the negative sentiment within Malaysian society, it was known that many Rohingya Muslims attended the event that became the 2020 Tablighi Jamaat COVID-19 hotspot in Malaysia, and contact tracing efforts by MERCY Malaysia was done in collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Islamic Medical Association of Malaysia (IMARET), Malaysian Relief Agency (MRA), CPRC, Ministry of Health (MOH) and Taiwan Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation (Tzu Chi). Assistance and support was given to the Rohingya people found to be Covid-19 positive by ensuring that their family members were quarantined and given food aid. Recognising that there are many undocumented migrant workers who may also fear arrests due to the legality of their status, MERCY Malaysia echoed the call for an amnesty made by the Malaysian Bar, together with manufacturers and NGOs such as the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers and Tenaganita to guarantee that Covid-19 testing can be done without the threat of detention and deportation.

However, with the provisions in Article 19, which outlines the scope of Investment Towards Self- Sufficiency, the organisation -through the Board of Trustees- \\"has the power to own land, to apply for and acquire land, to lease, charge and discharge land, erect and own buildings on land acquired.\\" =Executive Council= According to Article 8 of the Constitution, The Executive Council shall consist of; # A President; who shall be a Medical Doctor # Two (2) Vice- Presidents, of which Vice-President I shall be a Medical Professional and Vice-President II who is not a Medical Professional; # An Honorary Secretary; # An Assistant Honorary Secretary; # An Honorary Treasurer; and # Three (3) Ordinary Council Members of which at least one (1) shall be a Member who is a medical professional. =Society Member= According to Article 6, there are two types of memberships that allows for voting rights in the Annual General Meeting; Ordinary Members and Life Members. The difference is defined in the fees paid to the society. Another type of membership available is Honorary Membership. Since this category seeks to honour individuals who have directly or indirectly contributed to the organisation's objectives, and nominations are made by the Executive Council, Honorary Members are not entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting. =Secretariat= According to Article 11, \\"The Society shall have a Secretariat consisting of an Executive Director and a number of officers, all employed by the Society either on a permanent or contract basis.\\" The Secretariat is responsible for executing decisions made by the Executive Council, where the Executive Director reports to the Executive Council on a regular basis. To avoid conflict of interest, no member of the Executive Council shall at the same time be employed as a member of the Secretariat. This distinction is also necessary as the Executive Council are nominated by society members. The officers in the Secretariat are employed by the organisation, and as such their relationship with the organisation is governed by their employment contract and the Labour Law of Malaysia.

Founded in 2004 by Ed Bailey and John Guggenmos, Halo first gained attention by being one of the few smoke-free LGBT bars in Washington, D.C. before the citywide smoking ban was enacted in January 2007. Bailey and Guggenmos previously started other Washington, D.C. LGBT clubs and events including the Velvet Nation party at Nation, Tracks, Millennium at the 9:30 Club, Ozone, and Cobalt. In 2007, Bailey and Guggenmos sold their remaining share of Halo to Babak Movahedi and opened Town Danceboutique on U Street, NW. Halo's location is a narrow, two- story building that originally served as an automobile repair shop. When the bar opened in 2004, only the second floor was used by Halo and it consisted of 1,500 square feet (139 sq m). In September 2005, the first floor of Halo opened bringing the total amount of space to approximately 3,000 sq ft (278 sq m) with a capacity for 200 people. Halo's interior design by Greg Keffer of Studios Architecture is influenced by the Art Deco movement. The bar features curved ceilings, white walls, blue and purple accent lighting, silver bar stools, and winding banquettes. In August 2008, the second floor underwent a $200,000 renovation designed by Paolo Zavala of VOA Associates Incorporated that was described as retro-futuristic and compared to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's movie, A Clockwork Orange. The reopening of the second floor bar took place on September 5, 2008, and included a ribbon cutting ceremony by Mayor Adrian Fenty. Halo closed in early 2010, and was replaced by Mova Lounge. Mova Lounge declared bankruptcy in October 2010. Mova Lounge closed in December 2012. The space was radically renovated (removing much of its modernist look) and occupied by Number Nine in early 2011. The new bar caters to a wider range of customers than Halo or Mova Lounge, although most of its clientele is still primarily gay men.

Penn Station in New York City. A vane display is a type of 7-segment display. Unlike LED and VFD segmented displays, vane displays are composed of seven physical surfaces, typically painted white, but occasionally other colors, such as yellow or fluorescent green. If a segment is to be displayed as \\"off\\", it will be rotated so that its edge faces forward, with the painted surface pointing away and not visible. A segment that is to be displayed as \\"on\\" will be rotated so that the painted surface is shown. Vane displays operate in a similar manner to flip-disc displays, in that the segments are quickly moved using electromagnets. Some variants used where the display need not necessarily be changed quickly use electric motors to rotate the displays in and out of place. Vane displays have been used in game shows and on scoreboards in sports arenas and stadiums. Like eggcrate displays, they are not washed out by bright lights such as those found in a television studio. Another benefit of the vane display is that if the power supply is lost, the display will continue to show whatever the last value was before power was cut. However, like flip-disc displays, if many elements must be changed at the same time, the flipping displays may present a significant amount of noise. Examples *American and Canadian game shows have used vane displays to display contestants' scores or for countdown clocks. Prior to this, the slide display was more common. *The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority has used vane displays on several of their automatic toll collection baskets to display the toll due. *The New Jersey Turnpike previously used vane displays for all roadway speed limit signs; it was not uncommon to see them blank; VMS sign replacements now use a new electronic speed limit sign. Various other locations with variable speed limits also employ either this or eggcrate, flip-disc, or LED displays to display the current speed limit for the area.

It is distinguished from travel by traditional groups, such as the Tuareg across the Sahara and the Inuit across the Arctic, who use subtle cues to travel across familiar, yet minimally differentiated terrain. Land navigation is a core military discipline, which uses courses that are an essential part of military training. Often, these courses are several miles long in rough terrain and are performed under adverse conditions, such as at night or in the rain. In the late 19th century, land navigation developed into the sport of orienteering. The earliest use of the term 'orienteering' appears to be in 1886. Nordic military garrisons began orienteering competitions in 1895. United States In the United States military, land navigation courses are required for the Marine Corps and the Army. Air Force escape and evasion training includes aspects of land navigation. Army Field Manual 3-25.26 is devoted to land navigation.

Rogers was a noted beauty who worked in a New York tobacco store, which attracted the custom of many distinguished men, clearly on her account. When her body was found in the Hudson River, she was assumed to have been the victim of gang violence. However, one witness swore that she was dumped after a failed abortion attempt, and her boyfriend's suicide-note suggested possible involvement on his part. Rogers' death remains unexplained. She inspired Edgar Allan Poe's pioneering detective story \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\". Early life Mary Rogers was probably born in 1820 in Lyme, Connecticut, though her birth records have not survived. She was a beautiful young woman who grew up as the only child of her widowed mother. At the age of 20, Mary lived in the boarding house that was run by her mother, although it was her amazing beauty that made her the talk of the neighborhood. Her father James Rogers died in a steamboat explosion when she was 17 years old, and she took a job as a clerk in a tobacco shop owned by John Anderson in New York City. Anderson paid her a generous wage in part because her physical attractiveness brought in many customers. One customer wrote that he spent an entire afternoon at the store only to exchange \\"teasing glances\\" with her. Another admirer published a poem in the New York Herald referring to her heaven-like smile and her star-like eyes. Some of her customers included notable literary figures James Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving, and Fitz-Greene Halleck. First disappearance On October 5, 1838, the newspaper the Sun reported that \\"Miss Mary Cecilia Rogers\\" had disappeared from her home. Her mother Phoebe said she found a suicide note which the local coroner analyzed and said revealed a \\"fixed and unalterable determination to destroy herself\\". The next day, however, the Times and Commercial Intelligence reported that the disappearance was a hoax and that Rogers only went to visit a friend in Brooklyn. The Sun had previously published a story known as the Great Moon Hoax in 1835, causing controversy. Some suggested this return was actually the hoax, evidenced by Rogers's failure to return to work immediately. When she finally resumed working at the tobacco shop, one newspaper suggested the whole event was a publicity stunt managed by Anderson. Murder On July 25, 1841, Rogers told her fianc√© Daniel Payne that she would be visiting her aunt and other family members. Three days later, on July 28, the police found her corpse floating in the Hudson River in Hoboken, New Jersey. Referred to as the \\"Beautiful Cigar Girl\\", the mystery of her death was sensationalized by newspapers and received national attention. The details of the case suggested she was murdered, or dumped by abortionist Madame Restell after a failed procedure. Months later, the inquest still ongoing, her grief-stricken fianc√© Daniel Payne committed suicide by overdosing on laudanum during a bout of heavy drinking. A remorseful note was found among the papers on his person where he died near Sybil's Cave on October 7, 1841, reading: \\"To the World ‚Äì here I am on the very spot. May God forgive me for my misspent life.\\" The story, much publicized by the press, also emphasized the ineptitude and corruption of the city's watchmen system of law enforcement. At the time, New York City's population of 320,000 was served by an archaic force, consisting of one night watch, 100 city marshals, 31 constables, and 51 police officers. The popular theory was that Rogers was a victim of gang violence. In November 1842, Frederica Loss came forward and swore that Rogers' death was the result of a failed abortion attempt. Police refused to believe her story, and the case remained unsolved. Interest in the story waned nine weeks later when the press began publicizing a different, unrelated murder case, that of John C. Colt's murder of Samuel Adams. In fiction thumbright1853 illustration for \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\", a story inspired by the death of Mary Rogers Rogers' story was fictionalized most notably by Edgar Allan Poe as \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\" (1842). The action of the story was relocated to Paris and the victim's body found in the River Seine. Poe presented the story as a sequel to \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1841), commonly considered the first modern detective story, and included its main character C. Auguste Dupin. As Poe wrote in a letter: \\"under the pretense of showing how Dupin... unravelled the mystery of Marie's assassination, I, in fact, enter into a very rigorous analysis of the real tragedy in New York.\\" In the story, Dupin suggests several possible solutions but never actually names the murderer.

The village is across a narrow valley from Hooley in north of the borough of Reigate and Banstead; through the valley runs the Hooley Tunnel cutting and A23, the only road from which the village can be accessed, from two designated side roads; a few metres south of the southern T-junction, the road divides into two grades: the A23 to Redhill, south, and the M23 motorway which has a junction with the M25 motorway within Merstham's boundaries, the former village of the hilltop land. The post town, Coulsdon in Greater London is centred due north. History Unlike Hooley which was mostly part of Coulsdon manor and parish, the land here was within the traditional boundaries of Merstham as a village, that is within its ecclesiastical parish. The property called Netherne -- 'Lez Nedder' in 1522 -- was acquired in the first decade of the 20th century by the Surrey County Council for an asylum; the quit-rent payable yearly for the land of a little over half of one pound sterling recorded in 1522 was enfranchised from the land by the Council paying its owner. Being on the ridge of the North Downs, the relevant mineral prosperity of the parish was important at the slopes straddling this particular plateau, very sparsely inhabited though it was, and increasingly bereft of water, being aloft of aquifers. The county history of 1911 states: =20th century psychiatric care= Netherne Hospital opened in 1903 as a pleasant asylum for psychiatric patients. The complex could house up to 2000 patients at its peak and its founders built its own laundry, power station, sewage works, farm and sporting facilities. The hospital was known to be progressive in its treatment of mental illnesses, including in its use of art therapy and psychiatric rehabilitation. It closed in 1994 following the community integration of most of its patients. The hospital chapel was chosen as the site on which to build the new community's swimming pool. Notwithstanding this history, little remains at all apart from a minority of converted buildings. The central area comprising the original administration building, the water tower, two ward blocks, and four smaller detached buildings now form the Netherne on the Hill Conservation area, and are locally listed. =Conversion to residential estate= The former hospital estate was sold by the Department of Health to M J Gleeson in 1995, with development of a new village commencing shortly afterwards. The development included about 440 houses, a nursing home, a business centre, a shop, a public house and recreational open space. Demography Demography is difficult to quantify precisely for the village. No designated UK ward had yet been created for Netherne-on-the-Hill in local government in time for the United Kingdom Census 2011. However the village formed in 2011 approximately half of the Lower Output Area Reigate and Banstead 004E, whose population was 2,698 clustered into divisions of this village and Hooley, altogether covering . This gave a density which is valid for the settlement approximately, therefore, of 6.3 persons per hectare. The population if exactly half would be 1,349, which provides an approximation for both. Amenities Netherne's amenities mainly comprise a village shop, indoor swimming pool, tennis courts, football and cricket pitches, but the bowls club was knocked down as the building was not safe .Website of the village's community organisation NetherneVillage.org A village hall opened in the former recreation hall in 2011. The cricket pavilion has been acquired by the management company of the village and is available for private hire. In October 2017 a community cafe will open here one day a week. The village has a website which has details of all the amenities which can be found at www.nmanltd.com.Village Hall Events Day 2011 NetherneVillage.org There is a commuter minibus that runs to Coulsdon South station at peak times during the week. The village is set in extensive landscaped grounds. Religion The nearest place of worship and present parish within the Church of England is at 13th century St Margaret's, Chipstead, approximately 600 metres west of the village centre, in Hooley.Church of England Chipstead, St Margaret, parish map. The Roman Catholic church to St Teresa of the Child Jesus, Merstham south is named this as it shares its Deacon and two Priests in a wider parish celebrating The Nativity of the Lord.Parish of the nativity of the Lord Diocese of Arundel and Brighton The Croydon Mosque in Sunni Islam is NNE and was founded at its current address in 1978, having been established in the early 1960s.

Biography =Early career= His early career was that of a commercial traveller. He was evidently successful enough at this, that he was able to indulge his interest in photography. In 1901 he started a business at 50 Gray's Inn Road, Holborn for the purposes of making moving pictures on a hand cranked Lumiere camera, which had bought a few years before and then showing the resulting films to the public -for a fee. This was the Autoscope Company. Like the early Mitchell and Kenyon films, the genre was mainly 'topicals'; for they require the least amount of preparation and expense. On 1 January 1906 it merged with the Warwick Trading Company with Barker as the managing director.The London Project: Autoscope Company Accessed 5 May 2008 Having left Warwick he set up Barker Motion Photography Limited in December 1909 at Number 1 Soho Square, Westminster, London. Now he wanted to shoot film using set stages regardless of the weather. Having already purchased a house called \\"The Lodge\\", Ealing (now renamed the White Lodge, Ealing Studios) overlooking Ealing Green, he procured the adjacent property two years later in 1904. This second house was set back from Ealing Green behind a school on the west-side, and was therefore known as the West Lodge. Having of land there was plenty of room to build stages, which he did, three in number. Back then, early Edwardian Ealing had two striking similarities to modern day Ealing: it still looks majestic (hence its title 'Queen of the Suburbs') and in the words of one writer \\"it still ain't Hollywood\\". Therefore, the original stages were built with very tall glass walls and roofs to make the most of the available light whilst keeping out the British weather.Ealing and Brentford: Economic history, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7: (Acton, Chiswick, Ealing and Brentford, West Twyford, Willesden) (1982), pp. 131‚Äì144. URL: . Date accessed: 5 May 2008. By 1912 this had become the largest film studio in Britain and possibly Europe. Many productions were released under his trademark of Bulldog Films. =American market= At that time British cinema started facing two important problems. One was the restrictive practises of the new Motion Picture Patents Company, which prevented English films from being shown to audiences in America. Hitherto, foreign films had prominence on American screens. This cartel effectively put a limit on the revenue that English film-makers could hope to receive for their investment. Secondly, film prints copies were purchased out right by the distributor. This meant a popular film would not earn the film maker any more than an unsuccessful one. However, it also meant that the audiences had no choice but to see ever degrading prints that had become evermore scratched through repeated use. As more and more frames were lost due to multiple re-splicing and general damage, so the action would unexpectedly jump forward whilst the film was being watched. The first problem he attempted to rectify by travelling to America to voice his support at the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC) meeting of February 1909. This organisation had been set up in the vain hope of challenging the cartel's dominance.Segrave, Kerry (2004) Foreign Films in America: A History pp 11‚Äì12. Pub: McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina =Advancing the British film industry= He then set about to improve the viewing experience of the public by popularising films which were released on a rental only basis. The very first of these for hire only films is now considered by film buffs to be the first important British film. This is despite no copies of this production surviving. Still from Sixty Years a Queen This film was a lavish adaptation of Henry VIII. Barker even used some of the original stage sets from Her Majesty's Theatre. He was reported to have paid Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (who was actor/manager of the before-said theatre), ¬£1,000 for doing his interpretation of Cardinal Wolsey for the film. After being shown to record audiences, the total film stock was ceremoniously burned before the press to promote hired films as a way of ensuring the public saw only good quality stock whilst at the same time maximise his own profits by maintaining control of the prints. Another entrepreneur and film distributor called G.B. Samuelson, persuaded Barker to make what became another very important British film: Sixty Years a Queen (1913) about the life of Victoria. Samuelson, also heavily financed the production of this film and so further increased his fortune through its success. After Barker made his last films in the 1920s, Samuelson went on in 1924 to found the Southall Film Studio, just west in a converted aircraft hangar which stood in Gladstone Road. Unfortunately both studios then suffered from the recession.Southall Studios Accessed 11 May 2008 He died on 6 November 1951 in Wimbledon, London. In 2001 and after many changes of ownership at Ealing Studios, Ealing Council approved planning permission to demolish the West Lodge as part of a major new studio development project; the original Lodge survives as studio offices.Ealing planning committee (18 Oct 2006) 02 x 03 -Ealing Studios.doc, page 13, Accessed 21 January 2011 List of films Beerbohm Tree as Cardinal Wolsey Topicals: *London Day by Day Film Series: *Cape to Cairo (1907).

It was affiliated to an extremist offshoot of the Breton Autonomist Party. Initially, Breiz da Zont was the organ of the nationalist grouping known as Parti nationaliste int√©gral breton (Breton Integral Nationalist Party: PNIB) led by Th√©ophile Jeusset. Morvan Lebesque participated in the drafting committee, and also edited the journal at the request of Jeusset, who was forced to give up for health reasons. The poet Gwilherm Berthou and the composer Paul Ladmirault were members. Antisemitism In its early phase the journal was strongly linked to antisemitic and fascist ideology. In an article published in July 1931, Th√©ophile Jeusset wrote: > It is due to our particular resistance to the conquest of sovereign French > territory by the corrupting ideas which emanate more or less from the Jews - > 'freemasonry', 'secularism' - etc, that the Bretons were decimated during > the last world war: over 200,000 of them.

An article in August 1931 includes the words \\"we, complete Breton nationalists, could also qualify us as National Socialist supporters of Adolf Hitler.\\" Kentoc'h Mervel In 1929 Gwilherm Berthou suggested to C√©lestin Lain√© that a nationalist militant group dedicated to direct action to should be formed. This was to be called Kentoc'h Mervel (Sooner Death). As Lain√© sought his own recruits, Berthou brought the staff of Breiz da Zont to join en masse. When Lain√© discovered this he distanced himself from Berthou, believing that a public journal could not create an effective support for a secret organization, as it would be too easily infiltrated. Lain√© went on to form Gwenn ha du. Lain√© later wrote \\"I don't know what became of Kentoc'h Mervel after that, except that it never grew beyond fancy words.\\"Daniel Leach, \\"Bezen Perrot: The Breton nationalist unit of the SS, 1943-5\\", e-Keltoi Later developments After the departure of Morvan Lebesque, the journal moved away from fascism towards a more conventional conservatism, monarchism, Breton nationalism and Catholicism.

He was a member of several nineteenth-century nationalist societies, a founding member of Sinn F√©in, and a director of the Sinn F√©in Printing & Publishing Company. Dixon was a member of the Dublin branch of the Young Ireland Society (YIS), a literary and political organisation founded in 1881 to encourage political debate among Irish nationalists. Its members included Fred Allan, John MacBride and John Wyse Power, and it contained a strong element from the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), a revolutionary secret society. In the spring of 1885 he gave a lecture to the Society on the need to protect Irish industry. About this time Dixon met Arthur Griffith, and the two became lifelong friends. The Dublin YIS foundered after 1886, and in 1887, when Fred Allan founded the National Club, a social club, with IRB money, Dixon ran the club's Literary Society with Patrick Lavelle. Both Dixon and Lavelle were IRB members. Dixon joined the Parnell Leadership Committee, established in December 1890 at the National Club to create an alliance between local government officials across the country to consolidate the support base of Charles Stuart Parnell following the divorce scandal, and was on the executive of the associated Parnell Leadership Fund, whose purpose was to raise money to maintain a Parnellite presence in the press, with Allan and Wyse Power. In 1891, the National Club Literary Society, which had been active on the Parnellite side throughout the crisis, called on nationalist literary and political societies to unite under a single body, and in September that year the Young Ireland League (YIL) was formed. Dixon was on the executive of the YIL with MacBride and Lavelle; they organised republican commemorative events, including those of the National Monuments Committee, in Dublin. During this period Dixon wrote political letters to the radical Belfast newspaper, the Northern Patriot. When, in 1896, a provisional committee was set up to celebrate the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion, Dixon, Lavelle, and Allan were members. Dixon was active in the Celtic Literary Society, run by William Rooney, of which Arthur Griffith was also a member. He was an early contributor to Rooney and Griffith's newspaper, the United Irishman (started 1899), and a founding member, with Griffith, of the Sinn F√©in organisation in 1905. When Griffith closed down the United Irishman in 1906, and formed the Sinn F√©in Printing & Publishing Company to publish its successor, Sinn F√©in, Dixon was one of the directors of the company.Mathew Staunton, 'The Nation Speaking to Itself: A History of the Sinn F√©in Printing & Publish Co. Ltd. 1906-1914' in The Book in Ireland, J. Genet, S. Mikowski, F. Garcier [eds.] (Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), p 232. He remained politically and personally close to Griffith for the remainder of Griffith's life. Dixon, Griffith and John MacBride met for lunch on a daily basis in a Dublin restaurant owned by John Wyse Power and his wife Jennie. When MacBride was sued for divorce by Maud Gonne, his wife of two years, Dixon, although also a friend of Gonne's, swore an affidavit in support of MacBride. Dixon was one of the hundreds of nationalists arrested in the wake of the Easter Rising in 1916. He was interned initially at Frongoch, but being considered \\"a dangerous leader\\" he was transferred to Reading. While at Frongoch, he acted as camp librarian, befriended the future republican leader Michael Collins, and wrote to the Archbishop of Dublin, William Walsh, to complain about the lack of religious services at the camp. Walsh was able to arrange for a chaplain to be appointed. Dixon was released in December 1916. His daughter Br√≠d was involved in the Rising, but escaped arrest. During the War of Independence Dixon was again arrested and interned at Ballykinlar. For most of his life, Dixon was a law clerk with a firm of Dublin solicitors. According to one of his fellow internees at Frongoch, he \\"could have been a famous lawyer, but he refused to take whatever oath or declaration then imposed on lawyers...and was content to be employed as a clerk in a law office.\\" In 1921 he became manager of his son's solicitors firm. He was also active in the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Dixon died after being struck by a car as he left his office in Dublin on 4 December 1928, aged 69.

Formally, a linear continuum is a linearly ordered set S of more than one element that is densely ordered, i.e., between any two distinct elements there is another (and hence infinitely many others), and complete, i.e., which \\"lacks gaps\\" in the sense that every non-empty subset with an upper bound has a least upper bound. More symbolically: 1. S has the least-upper-bound property, and 2. For each x in S and each y in S with x < y, there exists z in S such that x < z < y A set has the least upper bound property, if every nonempty subset of the set that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Linear continua are particularly important in the field of topology where they can be used to verify whether an ordered set given the order topology is connected or not. Unlike the standard real line, a linear continuum may be bounded on either side: for example, any (real) closed interval is a linear continuum. Examples * The ordered set of real numbers, R, with its usual order is a linear continuum, and is the archetypal example. Property b) is trivial, and property a) is simply a reformulaton of the completeness axiom. Examples in addition to the real numbers: *sets which are order-isomorphic to the set of real numbers, for example a real open interval, and the same with half-open gaps (note that these are not gaps in the above-mentioned sense) *the affinely extended real number system and order-isomorphic sets, for example the unit interval *the set of real numbers with only +‚àû or only ‚àí‚àû added, and order- isomorphic sets, for example a half-open interval *the long line * The set I √ó I (where √ó denotes the Cartesian product and I = [0, 1]) in the lexicographic order is a linear continuum. Property b) is trivial. To check property a), we define a map, œÄ1 : I √ó I ‚Üí I by: :œÄ1 (x, y) = x This map is known as the projection map. The projection map is continuous (with respect to the product topology on I √ó I) and is surjective. Let A be a nonempty subset of I √ó I which is bounded above. Consider œÄ1(A). Since A is bounded above, œÄ1(A) must also be bounded above. Since, œÄ1(A) is a subset of I, it must have a least upper bound (since I has the least upper bound property). Therefore, we may let b be the least upper bound of œÄ1(A). If b belongs to œÄ1(A), then b √ó I will intersect A at say b √ó c for some c ‚àà I. Notice that since b √ó I has the same order type of I, the set (b √ó I) ‚à© A will indeed have a least upper bound b √ó c', which is the desired least upper bound for A. If b does not belong to œÄ1(A), then b √ó 0 is the least upper bound of A, for if d < b, and d √ó e is an upper bound of A, then d would be a smaller upper bound of œÄ1(A) than b, contradicting the unique property of b. Non-examples * The set of rational numbers is not a linear continuum. Even though property b) is satisfied, property a) is not. Consider the subset: ::A = { x  x < } : of the set of rational numbers. Even though this set is bounded above by any rational number greater than (for instance 3), it has no least upper bound in the rational numbers. (Specifically, for any rational upper bound r > , r/2 + 1/r is a closer rational upper bound; details at .) * The set of non-negative integers with its usual order is not a linear continuum. Property a) is satisfied (let A be a subset of the set of non-negative integers that is bounded above. Then A is finite so that it has a maximum. This maximum is the desired least upper bound of A). On the other hand, property b) is not. Indeed, 5 is a non- negative integer and so is 6, but there exists no non-negative integer that lies strictly between them. * The ordered set A of nonzero real numbers: ::A = (‚àí‚àû, 0) ‚à™ (0, +‚àû) : is not a linear continuum. Property b) is trivially satisfied. However, if B is the set of negative real numbers: ::B = (‚àí‚àû, 0) : then B is a subset of A which is bounded above (by any element of A greater than 0; for instance 1), but has no least upper bound in B. Notice that 0 is not a bound for B since 0 is not an element of A. * Let Z‚àí denote the set of negative integers and let A = (0,5) ‚à™ (5,+‚àû). Let: ::S = Z‚àí ‚à™ A : Then S satisfies neither property a) nor property b). The proof is similar to the previous examples. Topological properties Even though linear continua are important in the study of ordered sets, they do have applications in the mathematical field of topology. In fact, we will prove that an ordered set in the order topology is connected if and only if it is a linear continuum (notice the 'if and only if' part). We will prove one implication, and leave the other one as an exercise. (Munkres explains the second part of the proof ) Theorem Let X be an ordered set in the order topology. If X is connected, then X is a linear continuum. Proof: Suppose, x is in X and y is in X where x < y. If there exists no z in X such that x < z < y, consider the sets: A = (‚àí‚àû, y) B = (x, +‚àû) These sets are disjoint (If a is in A, a < y so that if a is in B, a > x and a < y which is impossible by hypothesis), nonempty (x is in A and y is in B) and open (in the order topology) and their union is X. This contradicts the connectedness of X. Now we prove the least upper bound property. If C is a subset of X that is bounded above and has no least upper bound, let D be the union of all open rays of the form (b, +‚àû) where b is an upper bound for C. Then D is open (since it is the union of open sets), and closed (if 'a' is not in D, then a < b for all upper bounds b of C so that we may choose q > a such that q is in C (if no such q exists, a is the least upper bound of C), then an open interval containing a, may be chosen that doesn't intersect D). Since D is nonempty (there is more than one upper bound of D for if there was exactly one upper bound s, s would be the least upper bound. Then if b1 and b2 are two upper bounds of D with b1 < b2, b2 will belong to D), D and its complement together form a separation on X. This contradicts the connectedness of X. =Applications of the theorem= 1\\\\. Since the ordered set: A = (‚àí‚àû, 0) U (0,+‚àû) is not a linear continuum, it is disconnected. 2\\\\. By applying the theorem just proved, the fact that R is connected follows. In fact any interval (or ray) in R is also connected. 3\\\\. The set of integers is not a linear continuum and therefore cannot be connected. 4\\\\. In fact, if an ordered set in the order topology is a linear continuum, it must be connected. Since any interval in this set is also a linear continuum, it follows that this space is locally connected since it has a basis consisting entirely of connected sets. 5\\\\.

She was first elected to the Assembly in October 2004. Immediately prior to that, she was CEO of Volunteering ACT from 1993 until October 2004 Born in Caterham, England of a Scottish background, Mary arrived in Australia when she was 12. In 1963 Mary graduated as a nurse from Wollongong Hospital and went on to work in New South Wales, Queensland and in the Aboriginal Community of Oenpelli, Northern Territory. In 1967 she again graduated from Wollongong Hospital, this time as a midwife. Mary returned to the Northern Territory and used her midwifery skills in many remote and isolated Aboriginal community's before accepting the role of sister in charge of the Dhupuma Residential College for Aboriginal students in Gove. In 1979 Mary moved to Canberra working with a group of other women to establish Tuggeranong Community Service, now known as Communities at Work, becoming a community worker when the organisation received funding. Mary also worked for the Federal Member for Canberra, Ros Kelly. Mary was also instrumental in helping to establish what is now Volunteering ACT and Volunteering Australia, becoming president of both organisations. She was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in 2003 for her services to remote indigenous communities and the broader community and also received the Centenary Medal in the same year. Mary was elected in October 2004 to represent the electorate of Ginninderra in the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. Her winning of the third seat in Ginninderra resulted in the ALP achieving majority government, the only time this has been achieved by a political party. After the 2008 election the Labor minority government needed the support of the Greens, who had won a record result of 4 parliamentary seats. As part of the negotiations Green MP Shane Rattenbury was elected Speaker of the ACT Legislative Assembly, the first time the Speaker did not come from the governing party. Representing her party, Porter was elected Deputy Speaker under Rattenbury. As a member of the Legislative Assembly, she prepared and introduced legislation to provide a statutory framework for retirement villages in the ACT. Her efforts were strongly supported by the ACT Retirement Village Residents Association under the presidency of Pam Graudenz and eventually saw the unanimous passage of legislation on 22 August 2012. The legislation came into effect on 4 March 2013.http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2012-38/default.asp In Mary's last election campaign of 2012, despite being a back-bencher, she polled more primary votes than any ALP candidate other than the Chief Minister. After Labor formed a coalition government with the Greens following the election, the party nominated Porter for the office of Speaker this time. However, as expected, she was not elected, as the sole Greens MP Rattenbury had announced to vote for the Liberal Party's candidate Vicki Dunne with the aim of harmonising the relationship of the rivaling parties. Porter was reelected Deputy Speaker afterwards. In her last term in the Assembly, Mary undertook a study tour of countries in Europe where assisted dying is legal. On her return, she prepared an extensive report which became the basis of an extensive community consultation process encouraging members of the public to have their say about the issue. In October 2015, she announced her intention to retire at the next ACT election due to illness, however in January 2016, she brought her retirement forward due to medical advice and resigned from the Legislative Assembly on 19 February. Following her retirement, Mary moved to Murrays Beach on the eastern shore of Lake Macquarie. She remains active in the community and is chair of NED,a not for profit organisation that supports community development projects. She is currently working in a voluntary capacity with the Law Faculty of the University of Newcastle to make Newcastle a restorative city.

He studied chemistry, physics and mathematics at the Vienna University of Technology and at the University of Vienna. In 1876, he received his PhD and in 1879, after his habilitation, became lecturer at the Vienna University of Technology. His research then was focused on the chemistry of photography. After spending some time at the Staatliche Gewerbeschule Vienna, he became lecturer at the H√∂here Gewerbeschule Vienna. This change improved his possibilities for doing research. In the following years, Eder developed sensitized gelatin silver process. Orthochromatic photographic plates, in combination with a color filter counter-acting the plates' inhomogeneous sensitivity to light of different wavelengths, yielded black and white images showing all colors of the light in their true brightness.

His another invention was the \\"mercury oxalate photometer\\" which was a chemical photometer to measure the intensity of UV radiation. After the effect of X-rays on photographic material was published, Eder did research to improve the sensitivity of photographic material to X-rays. By 1884, Eder started writing his Extensive Handbook of Photography, which is still available as reprint.

She was the daughter of King Magnus III of Sweden and Helwig of Holstein. Life Ingeborg was born a daughter of King Magnus III of Sweden and Helwig of Holstein. In 1288, she was engaged to marry to King Eric Menved of Denmark, a marriage which took place in Helsingborg in 1296. The marriage was as a part of dynastic policies: in 1298, her brother king Birger of Sweden married her husband's sister, Princess Martha of Denmark. The dispensation necessary for the marriage was not obtained until 1297 because of the conflict between her spouse and the archbishop Jens Grand. =Queen= Queen Ingeborg was described as beautiful and tender; songs describe how she asked for an prison amnesty at her wedding, and contemporary songs both in Denmark and Sweden praise her for her compassion and sense of justice.Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne, Danske dronniger; fortaellinger og karakteristikker af Ellen Jorgensen og Johanne Skovgaard, Kobenhavn H. Hagerup, 1910 She was a popular queen in Denmark, where she was referred to as ‚Äûgode Frue\\" or 'the Good Lady'. There is no information that she ever played any political role. She and her husband was the ally of her eldest brother, King Birger, and her husband's sister queen Martha of Sweden during the Swedish throne conflicts: they received their son in 1306 after the H√•tuna games, and later Birger and Martha temselwes as refugees after the Nyk√∂ping Banquet in 1318. She had eight sons who died as children, as well as six miscarriages, although the sources differ between eight and fourteen children: whatever the case, her many pregnancies led to miscarriages, or the birth of children who died soon after. In 1318, Queen Ingeborg gave birth to a son who lived, which was a cause of great celebrations after so many miscarriages. However, when the queen showed off the infant to the public from her carriage, the carriage suddenly broke and fell over, during which the infant fell from her grip, broke his neck and died. =Later life= After the death of her son, she entered the St. Catherine's Priory, Roskilde. The reason for this has contradictory. One version claims that she did this voluntarily; either because of sorrow for the death of her son, or alternatively, because of her grief caused by the deaths of her brothers, Erik Magnusson and Valdemar Magnusson. According to another legend, she was forcibly confined to the convent by her husband, who blamed her for the death of their son. According to another version, he had her imprisoned for involving too much in the political causes of her brothers. Regardless whether she was a guest or a prisoner of the monastery, it is known that she had been the benefactor of this particular convent prior to entering it. In 1319, she allegedly foretold the death of herself, her spouse and the archbishop, and soon after she died, followed by her husband. She was buried in Ringsted Kirke with the inscription: :\\"I, Ingeborg of Sweden, once queen of Denmark, ask for forgiveness from anyone to whom I may have caused sorrow, to be please to forgive me and to remember my soul.

It began as a rehab center for children with polio and over the years has evolved into one of New Hampshire's largest human services organizations, serving day and residential students with disabilities at Crotched Mountain School, young children with autism in its Ready Set Connect school-readiness programs, and adults with unique needs through Crotched Mountain Community Care. History The Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center began operation in 1953. It was established by Harry Gregg of Nashua, the father of New Hampshire governor Hugh Gregg and grandfather of future U.S. senator Judd Gregg. The creation of the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center was the culmination of a prolonged effort undertaken by Harry Gregg and others to build a center for rehabilitation for children.Crotched Mountain Foundation, A History, by Phillip E. Ginsberg, 1988 The story began around 1920 when Harry met Ezra A. Jones, MD, who was the first orthopedic specialist in New Hampshire. Orthopedics as a medical discipline arose from the challenge of dealing with unprecedented numbers of wounds and disabilities caused by the Great War, the \\"war to end all wars\\". Jones offered clinics in the major cities of the state. Jones met Gregg through the clinic established in Nashua. In 1936 Harry Gregg and Ezra Jones were instrumental in the founding of the New Hampshire Society for Crippled Children. Funded primarily by the Easter Seals drive, the Society publicized the need for more extensive treatment programs for disabled people, lobbied for favorable legislation and carried on the clinics around the state. The Society made small grants to support the medical and rehabilitation needs of children and adults. Several years after the establishment of the Society, Dr. Jones confided to Harry Gregg that his greatest wish was that New Hampshire would have a hospital where the patients with crippling diseases could come for sustained treatment and therapy under the most up-to-date conditions. This vision melded with one of Gregg's to build a \\"crippled children's camp\\" in Greenfield, New Hampshire. Gregg chose Greenfield because he had founded a summer camp for poor children from Nashua on the north shore of Sunset Lake, a small water body in Greenfield. Harry's sons had helped with the construction and operation of the camp. The camp was called the Nashua Fresh Air camp, and it eventually served more than 350 children each summer in two-week sessions before it closed in the 1970s. Through his experience with the camp Harry had learned of a large parcel of level land on a shoulder of Crotched Mountain, the Russell Dairy Farm. In the fall of 1942, the Society for Crippled Children authorized an expenditure of up to $7,500 to purchase the land at Crotched Mountain for the site of a \\"crippled children's camp\\". A little more than two months later, Gregg reported to the Society's Executive Committee that he had completed the purchase using funds from two bequests. While referred to as a camp, the dream had evolved to something far grander. A \\"dream picture\\" created by a Boston architect of what might be achieved that was presented to the 1944 annual meeting included not only medical, therapeutic and educational facilities, but also a working farm with a modern barn. All buildings would be connected by walks and ramps for residents using wheelchairs, crutches, and braces. The community included stores where people could work, residences where they would live and even two churches. (This painting of the Crotched Mountain community still exists and hangs in the president's office.) In 1944 Gregg described his plan to make this vision a reality to the Society Executive Committee. He announced that a friend was willing to establish a foundation and contribute $350,000 to it. Gregg recommended a fundraising goal of $250,000 for \\"a camp and fireproof Convalescent Hospital.\\" In addition, an endowment of $1 million should be raised to provide operating income. The choice of the location of the new rehabilitation center in remote and rural Greenfield was not without some controversy. Many thought it should be located in one of the larger cities in the state, Manchester or Nashua. Gregg consulted with experts in the field including Dr. Howard A. Rusk, who was the chair of physical rehabilitation medicine established at the New York University Medical Center. Rusk and other experts agreed that an institution serving the entire state would benefit from an independent location not affiliated with any hospital. The Society affirmed its choice. Fundraising continued throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s to raise the funds needed for the construction of the campus and the endowment. Gregg was able to generate publicity for his campaign in state, regional and national newspapers which supported the fundraising.\\"New Hampshire Sets Pace in Plans for the Handicapped\\", by Howard A. Rusk, New York Times, Oct. 19, 1947 Construction began in 1950 and the center opened in 1953. The facility originally treated people for polio, cerebral palsy, spina bifida and other physical and neurological disabilities. A center for adult rehabilitation opened in 1961, and a rehabilitation center for adults with brain injuries in 1986. It operated a school for the deaf from 1955 to the early 1970s. The complex today provides service to over 2,000 children and adults. Crotched Mountain has more than 900 employees and an annual budget of more than $42 million. In 2004, it unveiled the first wheelchair-accessible treehouse in New Hampshire. In 2007, an employee, Linda Bevins, was accused of embezzling $1.3 million from the Crotched Mountain Foundation. Bevins is accused of creating and paying fictitious employees, and then channeling the money to herself. The theft was discovered during an internal balancing of accounts, when an irregularity was noticed. A federal indictment was handed down in March 2008. A civil suit filed by the Foundation has resulted in a judgment of more than a million dollars against Bevins and her daughter Holly Sears.

Adjacent land became available as seafood industries began closing on Navy Point, and the museum acquired land from the former Coulbourne and Jewett crab and oyster packing house in 1966. By the end of the year, the Hooper Strait Lighthouse, which had been threatened by demolition, was moved to the newly acquired parcel. It opened to the public the following May. By 1971, all of the former industrial land of Navy Point had been acquired by the museum. In 1968, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum incorporated as an independent nonprofit corporation under article 501(c)3 of the IRS code. The museum hired its first permanent director, R. J. \\"Jim\\" Holt in 1971, who set the museum on a course for expansion and professionalization. In 1976, under Holt's leadership, the museum acquired adjacent acreage fronting Fogg's Cove, and in 1978, the institution was first accredited by the American Association of Museums (now American Alliance of Museums). Too deteriorated for the fledgling museum to save, the J. T. Leonard sank and was cut up in 1974, but the vessel's plight emphasized the need to create the infrastructure to maintain floating exhibits, so a traditional marine railway was constructed in 1974 and a boat shop in 1977. A major four- year restoration rebuilt the Edna E. Lockwood, from her original nine logs, and the vessel was relaunched in 1979. New purpose-built exhibition buildings were added, including the Waterfowling on the Chesapeake building (1975), Bay of the Chesapeake building (1980), and Steamboat building (1990). Beginning in the 1980s, the museum acquired several small historic structures, most notably Mitchell House, former home of Eliza Bailey Mitchell, sister to Frederick Douglass, and located them in the field fronting Fogg's Cove. By the time Jim Holt retired at the end of 1987, the museum had grown to a collection of historic structures and multiple exhibition buildings along a 17-acre waterfront campus. His successor, John R. Valliant, led the museum through further growth, including a library, Oystering Building, and At Play on the Bay building, the latter two products of a $17.2 million capital campaign. His tenure also saw the marked expansion of the museum's programming, from resident scholars whose original research supported new publications, exhibitions and curricula to yearlong boat yard apprentices and a groundbreaking Apprentice for a Day drop-in weekend boatbuilding class. Also created during Valliant's tenure was the Academy for Lifelong Learning, which offers peer-taught classes. Valliant also dramatically expanded the museum's collections, from the purchase of the Downes Curtis sailmaking tools (1997) to the acquisition of a major group of artworks by Baltimore marine artist Louis Feuchter (1885-1957) and the Robert H. Burgess collection of maritime objects, manuscripts, and photographs (2006). Valliant retired in 2006 and was succeeded by Stuart Parnes, who transformed the bulkheading of Fogg's Cove into a living shoreline and led other environmental initiatives. Beginning in 2009, his successor, Langley Shook, rebuilt the museum's finances following the downturn in the economy, while overseeing a major restoration of the 1955 skipjack Rosie Parks and acquisition of the historic 1920 buy boat Winnie Estelle, which replaced the buyboat replica Mister Jim for taking passengers on tours of the Miles River. Shook retired in 2014 and was succeeded by Kristen Greenaway, who expanded the museum's special exhibitions program beginning with A Broad Reach: Fifty Years of Collecting to mark the museum's 50th anniversary in 2015. She led an initiative to correct deferred maintenance on museum facilities, which included work on the Hooper Strait Lighthouse and repointing of the brick work on Dodson House, one of the museum's first three structures, now used for administrative offices. She also oversaw the museum's second major restoration of the bugeye Edna E. Lockwood beginning in 2016.  Exhibits  Log-bottom Bugeye The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum tells the geological, economic, and social stories of the Bay and those that lived there. Museum visitors can view over 100 boats and boat models, various artworks including a vast collection of watercolors, decoys, guns, ship‚Äôs signboards, and other historical Bay artifacts. Larger structures include Tilghman Island‚Äôs original Knapps Narrows drawbridge and the 1879 Hooper Strait Chesapeake screw-pile lighthouse. At the Museum‚Äôs working boatyard, visitors can have their hand at constructing a wooden skiff through the Apprentice for a Day program (see below). One of the interactive exhibits the Museum offers is Waterman's Wharf, where one can practice seafood harvesting by hauling an eel or crab pot out of the waters of Fogg Cove. Another exhibit, Oystering on the Chesapeake, transports visitors to the deck of a working waterman, and explains how the oyster industry has shaped the region‚Äôs landscape, culture, and history. Entrance to Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.The Floating Fleet is one of the most popular exhibits offered. This collection of water vessels docked at Navy Point includes Edna E. Lockwood, a National Historic Landmark, and the last sailing log-bottom bugeye. The museum helps keep the Chesapeake Bay log canoe racing tradition alive through preserving and sailing the Edmee S., the museum‚Äôs own log racing canoe, which is crewed and raced by Museum staff on weekends in the summer. The dredgeboat Old Point, built from seven logs in 1909, was once used to haul fresh fish in the winter, carry oysters during the fall, and dredge clams during the summer. Today, it offers kids a hands on and onboard \\"waterman\\" experience. Mister Jim, the museum‚Äôs replica buyboat, takes museum visitors out on the water for tours of the Bay throughout summer weekends. Through the variety of exhibits, the Museum provides the opportunity for all to experience the history and culture of the Chesapeake Bay region. Education and outreach CBMM offers field trips for students in grades PreK through college, emphasizing topics including history, geography, and the ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. A bus scholarship program helps visiting school groups with the cost of transportation. The Lighthouse Overnight Program allows children to experience the life of a mariner standing watch overnight. The Museum also provides programs for children such as Sea Squirts Summer Camp, as well as hands-on games, crafts, and storytelling throughout the year. For adults, the Museum's programs include a Lecture Series, Adult-Guided Tours, and the Academy for Lifelong Learning, a series of courses centered on continuing learning inside the classroom and beyond. In addition to a variety of programs, the Museum offers a 10,800-volume library of ship plans, manuscripts, books, and sketches. Working boatyard The Museum has a working boatyard for restoration projects and education. Visitors can learn about the restoration of commercial skipjacks and the preservation of the Museum's own floating fleet. The \\"Apprentice for a Day\\" program allows visitors to help construct a wooden skiff under the guidance of boatyard staff members.
