Dashiell, widow of Assistant Naval Constructor Dashiell; and commissioned 20 March 1943, Commander J. B. McLean in command. Service history= World War II  Dashiell arrived at Pearl Harbor 24 July 1943 to join the Fast Carrier Task Forces for the raids on Marcus Island of 31 August to 1 September; Tarawa, 18-20 September; and Wake Island, 5-6 October. Arriving at Efate, New Hebrides, 5 November, she prepared for the invasion of the Gilberts and was one of the first to enter the lagoon in the assault on Tarawa 20 November. She passed into the lagoon under heavy enemy fire, took up position just off Tarawa's reef, and opened return fire on shore batteries, enemy strongpoints and an ammunition dump to aid the troops ashore for three days. Following the cessation of hostilities on Tarawa, the Dashiell was sent to the US' west coast for an overhaul. After training exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, Dashiell arrived at Guadalcanal 16 March 1944. She cleared the next day to bombard Kavieng, New Ireland, on 20 March. Dashiell provided fire support, patrol, and convoy escort services from 6 April to 13 May as landings were made on the coast of New Guinea. She returned to Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons 17 May to prepare for the invasion of the Marianas. She sailed 4 June to guard transports held in reserve during the assaults on Saipan and on Tinian, then screened the landings at Guam during which she provided fire support from 20 to 26 July. Dashiell in November 1943. Her next action took her to Morotai, the stepping stone to the Philippines. Dashiell patrolled and screened transports during the landings there on 18 and 19 September and the reinforcement landings of 1 October. She joined the Northern Attack Force for the initial landings on Leyte at San Pedro Bay, on 20 October and cleared at once for New Guinea to bring transports north for reinforcement landings from 12 to 16 November. She again convoyed troops and supplies from New Guinea bases to Leyte between 24 November and 9 December. Three days later she sortied from Leyte Gulf screening an amphibious group bound for the assault landings at Mindoro. The second day out a kamikaze crashed the flagship, and the flag was transferred to Dashiell for the landings on 15 December. Returning to Leyte, she joined in repelling a Japanese air attack on 20 December. Six of her men were wounded in this action. Arriving in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, 9 January 1945 for the initial landings on Luzon, Dashiell remained there on patrol and fire support duty until 10 February. She downed at least three suicide planes, sank several Japanese small craft, and destroyed key positions ashore. She arrived at Ulithi 28 February to join the fast carrier task groups of the 5th Fleet for the raids on Japan and Okinawa during March in preparation for the Okinawa invasion. Dashiell screened the assault on 1 April, and remained off the island on radar picket duty. Her toughest battle against the kamikaze flights came on 14 April, when 20 planes attacked her station. She splashed four and outmaneuvered the rest, but was damaged by the near miss of a bomb and put into Ulithi 23 April for repairs. Returning to Okinawa 17 May, she joined the 3d Fleet for continued air attacks on Japan into August. At the end of the war she entered Tokyo Bay and remained there until 6 September, when she sailed for Pearl Harbor and Charleston, South Carolina, arriving 21 October. Dashiell was placed out of commission in reserve there 30 March 1946. 1951 ‚Äì 1960  Recommissioned 3 May 1951 Dashiell operated out of Newport along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until 26 August 1952 when she sailed to Northern Europe for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) fall exercises, visiting Greenock, Scotland, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, before returning to Newport 11 October. On 27 April 1953 she got underway for a round-the-world cruise, arriving at Yokosuka 2 June for operations off Korea and patrol duty in the Taiwan Straits until 9 October. She continued west to call at Saigon, Singapore, Colombo, Port Said, Cannes, Nice, and Lisbon before reaching Philadelphia 4 December. Between 1954 and 1959 Dashiell alternated four tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean with local operations out of Newport and exercises in the Caribbean. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve 29 April 1960. Dashiell was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974. She was sold 21 September 1975, and broken up for scrap.

Although the title can translate as The Pirate or The Buccaneer, this is no swashbuckling action-drama, but an idyllic domestic comedy of mistaken identity. The opera is based on the like-named play by Jean Richepin, who wrote the libretto, and is dedicated to La Comtesse de Mercy- Argenteau. It premiered at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris on 22 February 1894, and played for four performances. It was revived in 1908 in a production by students at the Moscow Conservatory under the conductorship of Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, and a Russian edition of the piano-vocal score was printed under the title –£ –º–æ—Ä—è (U morja = By the Sea). Nevertheless, despite the composer's own special fondness for this work, Le Flibustier seems never to have been performed again and never became part of the standard operatic repertoire. In the year of its premiere, the composer contributed a rare biographical article entitled \\"Flibustier in Paris\\" about his experiences with this opera published in the Russian periodical Knizhki nedeli. The composer extracted an orchestral suite from this work consisting of the initial Prelude, the Dances that close Act I, and the March in Act III. The French title of the opera has been transliterated into Cyrillic variously as –§–ª–∏–±—É—Å—Ç—å–µ—Ä or –§–ª–∏–±—é—Å—Ç—å–µ. Russian renderings of the French title include –ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–∞–∑–±–æ–π–Ω–∏–∫ (Morskoj razbojnik) and –ü–∏—Ä–∞—Ç (Pirat), both meaning \\"pirate.\\" Characters and Setting *Fran√ßois Lego√´z, old sailor: baritone *Pierre, his son, a former flibustier: basse chantante *Jacquemin, a flibustier: tenor *Janik, granddaughter of Fran√ßois Lego√´z: soprano *Marie- Anne, daughter-in-law of Fran√ßois Lego√´z: mezzo-soprano / contralto *Fishermen, wives of fishermen, girls: chorus The action takes place in Saint- Malo, at the end of the 17th century, in the dwelling of Lego√´z, which overlooks the sea. A view of the sea from Saint-Malo Synopsis Act I. Eight years ago, Pierre left home at the age of ten to be a pirate. His grandfather Lego√´z and cousin Janik‚Äîwho loves him‚Äîhave long hoped that he would return. One day, while only Marie-Anne is in the house, the stranger Jacquemin, who was Pierre's comrade years ago but does not know what has happened to him, stops by to inquire about him, bringing along some of his things. Both he and Marie-Anne are convinced that Pierre perished, and to spare old Lego√´z the bad news, she hides Jacquemin, but a misunderstanding occurs when Lego√´z enters and notices the bundle of Pierre's things. He discovers the hidden Jacquemin and mistakes him for Pierre. Before any correction can be made, there is rejoicing and dancing. Act II. At a celebratory feast Jacquemin recounts his adventures; Janik, thinking he is her cousin, is even more in love with him. Lego√´z, sensing that the two of them are being shy, asks the guests to leave them alone for a while. With the two of them alone, Jacquemin, who likewise has fallen in love with Janik, tells her the truth. The deception does not matter to her: she loves him, even though he is not the Pierre from her childhood. Jacquemin leaves Janik alone; her aunt Marie-Anne enters, and the two of them reconcile the deception. At this moment, by a great coincidence, the long-lost Pierre enters and identifies himself. Then Lego√´z enters with Jacquemin from outside, and the latter tries to embrace his friend, but Pierre rejects the traitor, and the deception is revealed to Lego√´z, who angrily sends Jacquemin away. Act III. Pierre recounts his adventures with Spanish and English ships, resulting in wealth that allowed him to leave the seafaring life to be a land-dweller. He invites Lego√´z to come live in his new country away from the fog of the sea-side. Lego√´z feels alienated from Pierre now‚Äîthey have become so different. Meanwhile, Janik is still in love with the banished Jacquemin, but Lego√´z will not hear of it, and there is no joy in the house, despite Pierre's return. Pierre finds out from Marie-Anne about the accidental nature of the mistaken identity (without knowing of Janik's feelings for Jacquemin, however), and outside on the street he relates this to Lego√´z, who decides to forgive Jacquemin. In the meantime, though, Jacquemin drops by the house to bid a reluctant final farewell to Janik and Marie-Anne. Pierre enters and reconciles with Jacquemin. But when it is clear that the latter has Janik's love, Pierre at first is furious, but eventually realizes that a physical contest can make no difference, and so he relents. Lego√´z enters, and, after learning what has transpired, consents to his granddaughter's marriage to Jacquemin and leads all in an homage to the sea. Bibliography C√©sar Cui.

Albert Heijn's wuppie campaign with the World Cup Wuppie Song (With a Wup we will win the World Cup) proved to be immensely popular, especially the \\"Mega Wups\\". Dutch media reported that cars which had a Mega Wup on their dashboards were broken into. (Don't leave your wuppie alone in your car) by Gert Onnink, Algemeen Dagblad, 20 juni 2006 A classroom of an elementary school in The Hague was burglarized which had a lot of wuppies exposed in the classroom. Wuppies were often given out as a prize from 1-900 numbers in the 80's.

He was born near Kilmarnock (although recent research has found that he may have in fact been born nearer Moffat) in 1769, and enlisted in the dragoons at the age of twenty. He fought in a number of actions in the French Revolutionary Wars, was briefly taken prisoner, and emerged from the conflict as a sergeant in the regiment. Over the next two decades he became a well-respected and competent soldier, serving as fencing-master of the regiment; a heavily built man, reported as 6'4\\" tall and \\"of Herculean strength\\" he was an expert swordsman and accomplished rider.Waterloo Battlefield Tours. At the Battle of Waterloo, he captured one of the two imperial eagle standards captured by the British Army during the Waterloo campaign. The year after Waterloo he was made a commissioned officer with the junior-most rank of ensign, retiring in 1821. The Eagle captured by Ewart, now on display in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards museum. The engagement At Waterloo, the Scots Greys were part of the Union Brigade, a formation of heavy cavalry regiments held in reserve by Wellington and consisting of the 1st (Royal) Regiment of Dragoons, the 2nd (Royal North British) Dragoons, and the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons. In the line of battle, General Thomas Picton's 5th Division was held in reserve, on the right of the Allied line, behind the Dutch-Belgian 2nd Division. The 5th contained a number of experienced veteran units from the Peninsular War, including the 92nd Foot (Gordon Highlanders). After a heavy exchange of fire, the Belgians were forced to fall back to the far side of the ridge on which they were stationed, and the 5th Division moved forward over the crest of the ridge to hold the line. After the heavy exchange of fire continued, with the 5th holding firm, it was decided that the division should charge to break up the French columns; the cavalry held in reserve were brought forward, and passed through the ranks of the infantry and into action. At this point, the Gordon Highlanders were exchanging fire with the 1st Battalion of the 45th, which was deploying around thirty yards to their front. The Greys quickly and unexpectedly passed through the infantry, moved forward the short distance between the lines, and broke through to the centre of the French infantry as it was forming into a defensive line. In the confusion that followed, the 45th was effectively broken as an organised unit, and the eagle it carried was quickly seized by Sergeant Ewart, in close fighting with a number of Frenchmen. To prevent it being recaptured, he was ordered to take it to safety; he did, but paused for some time overlooking the battlefield before finally carrying the trophy to Brussels. Whilst the brigade had not taken significant losses, they were disorganised, and carried forward to attack French artillery; charged by French cavalry in turn, they took heavy losses, and played no further part in the battle.  The reminiscences of James Paterson  James Paterson was a printer, editor and historian born and throughout his working life, mostly based, in Ayrshire. In 1846 he and several others dined with Charles Ewart at the Monument Inn in Kilmarnock and published the story of this Ayrshire hero in the Observer:  The legend  alt=The capture of the eagle is one of the most prized honours of the Scots Greys and, in commemoration of this, their cap badge shows the eagle. As with many such incidents, the story of the capture has grown greatly over the years, to the status of a legend; it is often told that the Greys charged the 45th, with the Gordons seizing hold of their stirrup-leathers and carrying themselves along into the fray, crying \\"Scotland Forever!\\". On the contrary, modern research suggests that there was no charge, but rather a quick walk (commonly used by large cavalry formations to preserve order when speed of arrival is irrelevant) into the advancing French line. The rest of the British Army called the Greys The Birdcatchers, as a wry nickname for the eagles capture.British Battles website. Throughout the entire Waterloo campaign two French Eagles were captured during battle, both by the Union Brigade in this particular action. Ewart was hailed a hero, honoured, and travelled the country giving speeches. He was given a commission as an ensign (a second lieutenancy) in the 5th Veteran Battalion in 1816, and left the army when this unit was disbanded in 1821.  Later life  He lived in Salford, and in his final years at Davyhulme, near Manchester, retiring on the full pay of an ensign. Ensign Ewart's grave  Death  Ewart died in 1846. His body was buried in the New Jerusalem Chapel graveyard in Bolton Street, Salford. His memorial read \\"In Memory of Ensign Charles Ewart, who departed March 23, 1846, aged 77 years\\". The grave was paved over and forgotten for many years, being uncovered in the 1930s, and his body was reburied by the Royal Scots Greys (as they were then titled) on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle in 1938. Today, he is best known to the general populace by a pub in Edinburgh which bears his name, the Ensign Ewart; it is located next to the Castle esplanade, where a monument marks his burial place.

Anfuso was born in Catania. His writing career started with a volume of short stories and poetry he published in 1917. Anfuso subsequently joined as a reporter with the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio in his attempt to seize Fiume for Italy (1919‚Äì1921). He returned to write for La Nazione and La Stampa, reporting from various foreign countries. A friend of Galeazzo Ciano, the two passed the exam for a career in diplomacy at the same time (in 1925). Anfuso was appointed to the Italian Consulate in Munich (1927), then to the missions in Hungary (1929), Germany (1931), the Republic of China (1932), and Greece (1934). In 1936, Anfuso was seconded to Francisco Franco's side during the Civil War. He was decorated for merit. In 1938, after Ciano was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anfuso became Ministry head of staff. In 1942 he became Minister in charge of the Italian Legation in Budapest. In 1943, after Mussolini escaped to Northern Italy with Nazi backing, Anfuso served as a diplomat for the newly founded Italian Social Republic, representing it in Berlin. As Ambassador in Berlin, he took care of the problems related to the presence in Germany of thousands of Italian servicemen deported after the 1943 Armistice. His role in trying to protect some Jews persecuted by the Nazis was mentioned during the Eichmann trial held in Israel in 1961. In 1945, he replaced the deceased Serafino Mazzolini as undersecretary for the Republic's Foreign Affairs Ministry. When the war ended in Italy's defeat, Anfuso made his way to France, but was soon recognized and arrested. He spent two years in prison, and after having been fully cleared by the French courts, he then exiled himself to Madrid. In 1950, he returned to Italy, going back to journalism and publishing several books. Having adhered to the Neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, he represented it in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Anfuso died in 1963, aged 62, while speaking on the floor in the Parliament in Rome. Family On 13 April 1944, in Berlin, Germany, Anfuso married Korn√©lia \\"Nelli\\" Tasnady-Sz√ºts (died 1995, Rome).

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Clorazepate is an unusually long-lasting benzodiazepine and serves as a majoritive prodrug for the equally long-lasting desmethyldiazepam, which is rapidly produced as an active metabolite. Desmethyldiazepam is responsible for most of the therapeutic effects of clorazepate. It was patented in 1965 and approved for medical use in 1967. Medical uses Clorazepate is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia. It may also be prescribed as an anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant. It is also used as a premedication. Clorazepate is prescribed principally in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and epilepsy, although it is also a useful anxiolytic because of its long half-life. The normal starting dosage range of Clorazepate is 15 to 60 mg per day. The drug is to be taken two to four times per day. Dosages as high as 90 to 120 mg per day may be used in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. In the United States and Canada, Clorazepate is available in 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg capsules or tablets. In Europe, tablet formations are 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg.Tranxene prescribing information in the Netherlands (Dutch language); accessed 2007-03-08. Clorazepate SD (controlled release) is available and may have a reduced incidence of adverse effects. The sustained-release formulation of clorazepate has some advantages in that, if a dose is missed, less profound fluctuations in blood plasma levels occur, which may be helpful to some people with epilepsy at risk of break-through seizures. Adverse effects Adverse effects of clorazepate include, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal reactions, cognitive impairment, confusion, anterograde amnesia, falls in the elderly, ataxia, hangover effects, and drowsiness. It is unclear whether cognitive deficits resulting from the long-term use of benzodiazepines return to normal or persist indefinitely after withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are also known to cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical effects including excitement and paradoxical worsening of seizures can sometimes result from the use of benzodiazepines. Children, the elderly, individuals with a history of alcohol abuse or a history of aggressive behavior and anger are at greater risk of developing paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal Delirium has been noted from discontinuation from clorazepate. A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in approximately one third of patients who take benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which is characterised by a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. When used for seizure control, tolerance may manifest itself with an increased rate of seizures as well an increased risk of withdrawal seizures. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clorazepate occurs frequently with regular use. Due to the development of tolerance, benzodiazepines are, in general, not considered appropriate for the long-term management of epilepsy; increasing the dose may result only in the developing of tolerance to the higher dose combined with worsened adverse effects. Cross-tolerance occurs between benzodiazepines, meaning that, if individuals are tolerant to one benzodiazepine, they will display a tolerance to equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines include a worsening of pre-existing symptoms as well as the appearance of new symptoms that were not pre-existing. The withdrawal symptoms may range from mild anxiety and insomnia to severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can be difficult in some cases to differentiate between pre-existing symptoms and withdrawal symptoms. Use of high doses, long-term use and abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal increases increase the severity of withdrawal syndrome. However, tolerance to the active metabolite of clorazepate may occur more slowly than with other benzodiazepines. Regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremor, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea. Interactions right All sedatives or hypnotics e.g. other benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antiepileptic drugs, alcohol, antihistamines, opiates, neuroleptics, sleep aids are likely to magnify the effects of clorazepate on the central nervous system. Drugs that may interact with clorazepate include, digoxin, disulfiram, fluoxetine, isoniazid, ketoconazole, levodopa, metoprolol, hormonal contraceptives, probenecid, propranolol, rifampin, theophylline, valproic acid. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cimetidine, macrolide antibiotics and antimycotics inhibit the metabolism of benzodiazepines and may result in increased plasma levels with resultant enhancement of adverse effects. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine have the opposite effect, with coadministration leading to increased metabolism and decreased therapeutic effects of clorazepate. Contraindications and special caution Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Chlorazepate if used late in pregnancy, the third trimester, causes a definite risk a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate with symptoms including hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Special precaution is required when using clorazepate in the elderly because the elderly metabolise clorazepate more slowly, which may result in excessive drug accumulation. Additionally the elderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even when blood plasma levels are the same. Use of benzodiazepines in the elderly is only recommended for 2 weeks and it is also recommended that half of the usual daily dose is prescribed. Pharmacology Clorazepate is a \\"classical\\" benzodiazepine. Other classical benzodiazepines include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, bromazepam and flurazepam. Clorazepate is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. Clorazepate produces the active metabolite desmethyl-diazepam, which is a partial agonist of the GABAA receptor and has a half life of 20 ‚Äì 179 hours; a small amount of desmethyldiazepam is further metabolised into oxazepam. Clorazepate exerts its pharmacological properties via increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel of GABAA receptors. This effect of benzodiazepines requires the presence of the neurotransmitter GABA and results in enhanced inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA acting on GABAA receptors. Clorazepate, like other benzodiazepines, is widely distributed and is highly bound to plasma proteins; clorazepate also crosses readily over the placenta and into breast milk. Peak plasma levels of the active metabolite desmethyl- diazepam are seen between 30 minutes and 2 hours after oral administration of clorazepate. Clorazepate is completely metabolised to desmethyl-diazepam in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the pharmacological properties of clorazepate are largely due to desmethyldiazepam. Chemistry Clorazepate is used in the form of a dipotassium salt. It is unusual among benzodiazepines in that it is freely soluble in water. Clorazepate can be synthesized starting from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzonitrile, which upon reaction with phenylmagnesium bromide is transformed into 2-amino-5-chlorbenzophenone imine.J. Schmitt, (1970)J. Schmitt, (1965)J. Schmitt, P. Comoy, M. Subsequent, G. Callet, I. Le Meur, T. Clim, M. Brunaud, J. Mereir, J. Salle, G. Siou, Chim. Ther., 4, 239 (1969) Reacting this with aminomalonic ester gives a heterocyclization product, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-carbethoxy-5-phenyl-2H-benzodiazepin-2-one. Upon hydrolysis using an alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide forms a dipotassium salt, chlorazepate. 500px Legal status In the United States, clorazepate is listed under Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act.

Plot  Set in the 23rd century in the year 2230, the player assumes the role of a bandana wearing mercenary named Damage. Working for Colonel Bossman and his underground crime syndicate, B.O.S.S., the player is pitted against Bossman's main rival, Takahiro Industries. Takahiro Industries has its own security, too, with an army of guards as well as various sophisticated robots. It is these that Damage has to fight against, going through various futuristic environments in order to assassinate Takahiro himself.  Gameplay  Being a total conversion of Quake, Malice features a similar gameplay style to that title. The game includes eighteen new levels, fourteen new enemies, various additional items (known as \\"Toyz\\" in the game), a new soundtrack, and new weapons. Unlike in Quake, weapons in Malice can be manually reloaded.  Reception  Press reactions to Malice were generally high in praise, with the game earning positive reviews from all publications featured. Online publication Adrenaline Vault gave the game 4.5/5 and it won their \\"Best Addon Award\\" in 1997. PC Gamer UK gave the game their \\"Game of Distinction Award\\" in 1997. PC Zone also praised the game, noting favourable how well Malice managed to get away from the original Quake and awarded the game 80%.

It is mostly composed of iron, silicon and oxygen, with smaller fractions of calcium and several other metals. Together with armalcolite and tranquillityite, it is one of the three minerals which were discovered on the Moon. It was then found in Lunar and Martian meteorites as well as a mineral in the Earth's crust. Pyroxferroite can also be produced by annealing synthetic clinopyroxene at high pressures and temperatures. The mineral is metastable and gradually decomposes at ambient conditions, but this process can take billions of years. Etymology Pyroxferroite is named from pyroxene and ferrum (Latin for iron), as the iron-rich analogue of pyroxmangite. The word pyroxene, in turn comes from the Greek words for fire (œÄœÖœÅ) and stranger (ŒæŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ). Pyroxenes were named this way because of their presence in volcanic lavas, where they are sometimes seen as crystals embedded in volcanic glass; it was assumed they were impurities in the glass, hence the name \\"fire strangers\\". However, they are simply early-forming minerals that crystallized before the lava erupted.Concise English Dictionary, Wordsworth Editions, 2007 p. 757William Alexander Deer, Robert Andrew Howie, J. Zussman Single-chain silicates, Volume 2, Geological Society, 1997, , p. 3 Occurrence Pyroxferroite was first discovered in 1969 in lunar rock samples from the Sea of Tranquility during the Apollo missions. Together with armalcolite and tranquillityite, it is one of the three minerals which were first found on the Moon.Lunar Sample Mineralogy, NASA Later, pyroxferroite was detected in Lunar and Martian meteorites recovered in Oman. It also occurs in the Earth's crust, in association with clinopyroxene, plagioclase, ilmenite, cristobalite, tridymite, fayalite, fluorapatite and potassic feldspar, and forms series with pyroxmangite. Pyroxferroite has been found in the Isanago mine, in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan; near Iva, Anderson County, South Carolina, USA; from V√§ster Silfberg, V√§rmland, Sweden; and Lapua, Finland. In the original lunar samples, pyroxferroite was associated with similar minerals, but also with troilite which is rare on Earth, but is common on the Moon and Mars. Synthesis Synthetic pyroxferroite crystals can be produced by compressing synthetic clinopyroxene (composition Ca0.15Fe0.85SiO3) to a pressure in the range of 10‚Äì17.5 kbar and heating it to 1130‚Äì1250 ¬∞C. It is metastable at low temperatures and pressures: at pressures below 10 kbar pyroxferroite converts to a mixture of olivine, pyroxene and a silicon dioxide phase, whereas at low temperatures, it transforms to a clinopyroxene. The presence of cristobalite, vesicular texture and some other petrographic observations indicate that the lunar pyroxferroite was produced upon rapid cooling from low-pressure and high-temperature (volcanic) conditions, i.e. that the mineral is metastable. However, the conversion rate is very slow and pyroxferroite can exist at low temperatures for periods longer than 3 billion years. Crystal structure. Colors: blue ‚Äì Fe, gray ‚Äì Si, red ‚Äì oxygen. Properties The crystal structure of pyroxferroite contains silicon-oxygen chains with a repeat period of seven SiO4 tetrahedra. These chains are separated by polyhedra where a central metal atom is surrounded by 6 or 7 oxygen atoms; there are 7 inequivalent metal polyhedra in the unit cell. The resulted layers are parallel to (110) planes in pyroxferroite, whereas they are parallel to (100) planes in pyroxenes. Chemical composition of pyroxferroite can be decomposed into elementary oxides as follows: FeO (concentration 44‚Äì48%), SiO2(45‚Äì47%), CaO (4.7‚Äì6.1%), MnO (0.6‚Äì1.3%), MgO (0.3-1%), TiO2 (0.2‚Äì0.5%) and Al2O3 (0.2‚Äì1.2%). Whereas magnesium is usually present at about 0.8%, in some samples it had an undetectably low concentration.

Although it is currently out of print, Card's novel The Worthing Chronicle (1983) covers some of the same ground. Hot Sleep was Card's first novel-length published science fiction story. A Planet Called Treason followed. The short story collection Capitol was published earlier that year. Plot summary The book follows Jason Worthing, also known as Jazz, who is a boy growing up on Capitol, the capitol planet of the Empire. Jas has \\"the swipe\\", which is a genetic trait that allows for telepathy. The swipe is feared in the Empire, so those who possess it are executed. After being found out as a swipe, Jas tries to escape, which leads to his capture by Abner Doon, who helps him rise to prominence as a space pilot. Eventually, Abner sends Jason away as the head of a colony so that the swipe would become more widespread, but when his ship reaches the planet, he is attacked, and the memories of all but one of the three-hundred eleven colonists are destroyed and two-thirds of the colonist are killed or damaged beyond awakening. Jason prevails, however, leading to the survival of the colony, which he visits every several years, being on Somec the rest of the time. Eventually, Abner Doon comes and sees how Jason has done, and after Doon leaves, Jason takes his ship to the bottom of the ocean. Title The title arises from the operation of somec, the life extension drug forming the foundation of the interstellar Empire. Somec creates an unbearable, torturous burning sensation throughout the body while pushing the patient to suspended animation. However, the somec process exterminates the user's memory, and so these memories are recorded and stored separately shortly before they go under, to be returned to the body after they have awakened, and so the memory of the process itself cannot be retained. Thus, each somec patient experiences the panic of burning hot sleep \\"for the first time\\" (as far as their memory goes) no matter how many times they have taken somec before.

It occurs when an underwriter, such as an investment bank or a syndicate, purchases securities from an issuer before a preliminary prospectus is filed. The underwriter acts as principal rather than agent and thus actually \\"goes long\\" in the security. The bank negotiates a price with the issuer (usually at a discount to the current market price, if applicable). The advantage of the bought deal from the issuer's perspective is that they do not have to worry about financing risk (the risk that the financing can only be done at a discount too steep to market price.) This is in contrast to a book building or fully marketed deal, where the underwriters have to \\"market\\" the offering to prospective buyers, only after which the price is set. Advantages and disadvantages The advantages of the bought deal from the underwriter's perspective include: # Bought deals are usually priced at a larger discount to market than fully marketed deals, and thus may be easier to sell; and # The issuer/client may only be willing to do a deal if it is bought (as it eliminates execution or market risk.) The disadvantage of the bought deal from the underwriter's perspective is that if it cannot sell the securities, it must hold them. This is usually the result of the market price falling below the issue price, which means the underwriter loses money. The underwriter also uses up its capital, which would probably otherwise be put to better use (given sell-side investment banks are not usually in the business of buying new issues of securities).

The author aims to present a comprehensive factual history of the Christian religion.  Contents  In the Prologue, Johnson writes: :\\"During these two millennia Christianity has, perhaps, proved more influential in shaping human destiny than any other institutional philosophy, but there are now signs that its period of predominance is drawing to a close, thereby inviting a retrospect and a balance sheet.... Christianity is essentially a historical religion. It bases its claims on the historical facts it asserts. If these are demolished it is nothing.... A Christian with faith has nothing to fear from the facts.\\"pp. vii‚Äìviii.

Part 8 closes by discussing the possible ending of the millennial-long East-West Schism. How far the ending of schisms within Christianity will go is to be seen. \\"[T]he argument about the control of the Christian Church is almost as old as Christianity itself; and it may be that it will continue so long as there are men and women who assert that Christ was God, and who await the parousia. Perhaps it is part of the providential plan that the organization of Christianity should be a perpetual source of discord. Who can say? We should remember the words of Saint Paul, towards the end of his letter to the Romans, the key document of the faith: 'O depth of wealth, wisdom, and knowledge in God. How unsearchable his judgments, how untraceable his ways. Who knows the mind of the Lord? Who has been his counsellor?'\\"(p. 514) The Epilogue describes the history of Christianity as a matrix for \\"a constant process of struggle and rebirth ‚Äì a succession of crises, often accompanied by horror, bloodshed, bigotry and unreason but [with] evidence too of growth, vitality and increased understanding.\\" The book \\"has necessarily stressed [Christianity's] failures and shortcomings, and its institutional distortions\\" but in the context of \\"its stupendous claims and its unprecedented idealism.\\"(p. 515‚Äì16) Johnson argues that Christianity is self- correcting, with an \\"outstanding moral merit to invest the individual with a conscience, and bid him to follow it.\\" \\"[I]t is thus no accident that all the implantations of freedom throughout the world have ultimately a Christian origin.\\"(p. 516) Indeed, \\"Europe was a Christian creation not only in essence but in minute detail.\\"(p. 515) The apotheosis that Christianity has provided, Johnson writes, \\"has reflected an effort to rise above our frailties...

Marty's New York Times review of the book in October 1976 asserts that \\"whether one can represent Christianity in only 556 pages becomes pedantic and frivolous in the face of the fact that Paul Johnson has successfully done so.\\" After Johnson's brief description of Jesus preaching the coming Kingdom of God, his death, and his followers' belief in Jesus's resurrection, Marty writes \\"along comes Paul,... the fanatic fool for Christ,\\" and, for Johnson, \\"the greatest Christian,\\" who \\"rescued Jesusism from its place among the more crabby Jewish sects of the day, picked up its hints of universal intent and then wrenched the faith and himself into a context where the 'salvation mechanism' is available for all people.\\" Near the end, the review describes the book as \\"a reliable if hard- edged story of the public church.\\" Donald Cantuar in Churchman (1977) expresses deep appreciation to Johnson's \\"tour de force\\", as for example in his estimation of Paul's impact: \\"The truth is that Paul did not invent Christianity. Or pervert it; he rescued it from extinction. Paul was the first pure Christian: the first to comprehend Jesus‚Äôs system of theology, to grasp the magnitude of the changes it embodied, and the completeness of the break with Judaic law.\\" (p. 35) Colin Gunton's review in Religious Studies describes the book as \\"long and enthralling\\", though it recounts reasons of state \\"encompass[ing] in the name of religion the subversion of the truth\\" for much of Christian history. He characterizes Johnson's view of Augustine of Hippo \\"as the villain of the story\\" and Paul and Erasmus as its heroes. This follows from the Augustinian account as a \\"total Christian society,\\" necessarily implying a \\"compulsory society.\\" (p. 242) Johnson contrasts that account with the Pauline theology of truth and human rebirth and the Erasmian view of Christianity as in \\"full alliance with the Renaissance,\\" including a distaste for persecution and oppression. The review cites Johnson's argument for Erasmus and Paul as providing pedigree of principles for the American Revolution and the Founding Fathers when \\"for the first time since the Dark Ages a society came into existence in which institutional Christianity was associated with progress and freedom rather than against them.\\"(p. 428)Colin Gunton (1983). \\"Paul Johnson, A History of Christianity,\\" Religious Studies 19(4), pp. 554‚Äì555.

Background  Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf had reduced the Austro- Hungarian forces along the Soƒça (Isonzo) front to reinforce his Trentino Offensive and also to assist with the defense of the Russian Brusilov Offensive then taking place on the eastern front. Italian Chief-of-Staff Luigi Cadorna turned his attention (along with that of Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta ‚Äì Commander of the Italian Third Army) to the Isonzo front and particularly, the city of Gorizia. They planned a heavy bombardment in a very restricted zone between Monte Calvario and Monte San Michele ‚Äì two heights overlooking the city. The bombardment would be followed by ground action to obtain control of the left bank of the Isonzo. Moreover, this battle would start with an advantage because the Italians had already succeeded in advancing towards the top of Monte Sabotino another height (which overlooks the Isonzo valley and is key to the control of the city) above Gorizia and Italian sappers had built several tunnels behind the emplacements of the Austro-Hungarian troops there.Gooch, John, The Italian Army and the First World War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 183 Cardona also made good use of railroads to quickly shift troops from Trentino back to the Isonzo line for this offensive against the weakened Austro-Hungarian defenses.  Battle  On 6 August the offensive was launched against Gorizia. The offensive was concentrated in two zones: the hilly area west of the Soƒça (Isonzo) river near Gorizia and the westernmost edge of the Karst Plateau near Doberd√≤ del Lago. In the Battle of Doberd√≤, the Italians, after bloody hand- to-hand combat, managed to conquer the main transport road leading from the coast town of Duino to Gorizia, thus securing their advance to Gorizia from the south. The Austro-Hungarian forces had to retreat on the line east of Gorizia (Mount ≈†kabrijel), leaving the heavily damaged town to the Italians. The bombardment at Gorizia was extremely heavy and effective. Borojevic asked for reinforcements but was denied. In the afternoon Cadorna ordered the 45th division to attack Monte Sabotino. In under one hour, supported by heavy artillery, the Italian infantry reached the peak. Simultaneously the attack on Monte San Michele also commenced. The Italian Infantry succeeded quickly to reach the summit while the Austro-Hungarian soldiers retreated waiting for a later counterattack. In the absence of reserve forces (which had been deployed to Mount Sabotino), that counter failed. With the conquest of Monte Sabotino and Monte San Michele, the previously strong Austro-Hungarian defensive line around Gorizia rapidly disintegrated. Then Monte Calvario fell during that night. On the right bank of the Isonzo there was only one regiment who then withdrew to the east on 8 August. The first platoons of the Pavia Brigade began to enter the city. Gorizia fell to Cadorna and a bridgehead was finally established across the Soƒça (Isonzo) River. The Austro-Hungarians shifted troops to the Gorizia sector to prevent a breakthrough. Borojevic, had already ordered his men to retreat further to the east, into a valley called The Vallone. Thus strategic positions on the western Carso such as Monte Sei Busi, the zone around Doberd√≤ del Lago and Monte Cosich to the north of Monfalcone (which the Vallone separated from the eastern Carso) were thus abandoned. However, the Austro-Hungarian defenses in the north and east of Gorizia still included an uninterrupted series of heights ‚Äì including ridges from Monte Santo, Monte San Gabriele, Monte San Daniele. These heights and Quota 383\\"Quota\\" is the Italian Army description of \\"hill\\". So this means Hill 383. lent themselves to place the Austro - Hungarian artillery and provide excellent observatories after the fall of Gorizia. These heights had been prepared for defense purposes and made it possible to block any passage towards by the Italian troops to Vienna and Trieste.Consociazione Turistica Italiana ‚Äì Sui Campi di Battaglia ‚Äì Il Medio e Basso Isonzo, quinta edizione, 1939, Milano The new Austrian front line now passed to Nad Logem (Quota 212), Quota 187 (near Devetachi), Opacchiasella, Nova Vas and Quota 208 north and south,Bonetti e basso Vallone / Itinerario delle quote 208 Quota 144 and Quota 77Turistica Italiana, 1939 and the Austro-Hungarian troops engaged the Italians in a series of heavy, defensive firefights. Content with having established the bridgehead, capturing Gorizia and the western Karst, and having suffered heavy losses, Cadorna ended the offensive on 17 August. The attack on Gorizia was the most successful Italian offensive along the Isonzo lines and greatly boosted Italian morale - especially since Gorizia had been promoted as a desirable objective, unattainable in earlier battles. In the wake of the battle Italy finally declared war against Germany, on 28 August. .

It was the culmination of ten years work that started in 1982 when Helen joined the band The Astronauts (Stiff Records) with Simon Burton and David Lief. Subsequently, Simon and Helen formed an all-female band called The Marines (CBS/Sony Records) with Denny Jones and Sarah Pritchard; Simon wrote and produced the material and they were managed by Colin Lester. After a couple of minor hit singles and tour support for Kylie Minogue in 1989, it was decided that Helen should become a solo artist. For the next 18 months, Helen and Simon worked on putting her solo album together. They signed to Warner Brothers and began recording in April 1992. Produced by Hugh Padgham and Simon Burton, the album featured Vinnie Colaiuta - drums; Pino Palidino - bass; Dominic Miller - guitar; Bob Marlett and Michael Scherchen - keyboards. The original pressing of the album only had 11 tracks; \\"Edge of a Dream\\" (featuring Bryan Adams) was added later on, not having been a part of the original album recording. \\"Summer of Love\\", which was a hit in Norway and Finland, has been covered by Faye Wong and numerous other artists.

It grows to between 25 and 39 cm, and was once thought to be extinct. It feeds on crabs, water insects, and crayfish. It weighs between 40 and 60 grams, and the population is considered vulnerable. It was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Limnogale, but has been moved to Microgale based on molecular data showing it to be deeply nested within the latter.  Life history  Microgale mergulus is strictly nocturnal, spending the day in stream side burrows, only emerging at night to hunt. Nocturnal movements appear to be restricted to waterways but include movements away from burrows and diving. Radio collar tracking has shown that some individuals are known to utilize stream channels as much as 1160 meters in length, while others may only patrol 500 meters. In one night a web-footed tenrec may travel 1550 meters along channels in search of food.  Diet  M. mergulus is only known to inhabit stream habitats in eastern Madagascar. Lypotyphlan is a term which has been used to group small, insectivorous mammals. While this term is no longer used in phylogenetics, it can still be used to accurately signify the diet of M. mergulus. The bulk of its diet consists of aquatic insects and larvae, with crustaceans like crayfish and small fish making up the rest. The larvae of insects in the orders Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Trichoptera are favored. Diets of individuals inhabiting zero-canopy steams appear to be the same as those living in forested streams.  Phylogeny  The aquatic or web- footed tenrec, Microgale mergulus, and other tenrecs are endemic to Madagascar. They are part of the monophyletic clade Afrotheria, which includes placental mammals of diverse anatomies including hyraxes, elephants and mammoths, manatees and dugong, tenrecs, golden moles, elephant shrews, and aardvarks. Genetic sequencing and other methods have confirmed the accuracy and relatedness of this grouping. The web-footed tenrec is one of 22 members of the genus Microgale. Molecular studies have led to its placement in the subfamily Oryzorictinae, along with two species each of the genera Nesogale and Oryzorictes.Nicoll, M., Ratsifandrihamanana, N. (2014), Growth of Madagascar‚Äôs protected areas system and its implications for tenrecs (Afrosoricida, Tenrecidae). Afrotherian Conservation. September 2014: 4-8. Published by IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. It is the largest member of this subfamily and likely evolved this increased size in response to its aquatic lifestyle. Ancestral tenrecs are thought to have rafted from mainland Africa to Madagascar in a single event. All tenrecs are thought to descend from a common ancestor that lived 29‚Äì37 million years (Ma) ago They include members of subfamilies Tenrecinae and Geogalinae as well as Oryzorictinae. While it is similar in habits to the related equatorial African otter shrews of family Potamogalidae, their aquatic lifestyles evolved independently from one another. The split between tenrecs and otter shrews has been dated to about 47‚Äì53 Ma ago. Conservation The aquatic tenrec is currently ranked by the IUCN as Vulnerable on the Red List. Due to their specialized habitat requirements and restriction to the island of Madagascar, it is estimated that less than 2,000 km2 of suitable habitat remains. Degradation of riparian ecosystems and siltation of streams are the leading threat to the species‚Äô. Deforestation is also recognized as a potential cause of decline. However, recent studies have shown healthy populations of M. mergulus in streams where forest has been cleared or otherwise degraded, as well as non-native plantations. Areas of its habitat which are currently protected include Ranomafana National Park and the Andringitra National Park (1989) and it is also reported in the new Nosy Volo Reserve in the east (2014). Within afrotherian mammals, Microgale mergulus is typically considered for highest priority conservation priority along with the giant otter shrew, giant golden mole, northern shrew tenrec and Nimba otter shrew, as well as some better- known conservation symbols like the dugong, Asian elephant, and three species of manatees. This priority has been analyzed using two different methods, including phylogenetic diversity (PD) and evolutionary distinctiveness (ED).

She has held the Miss Oregon Teen USA and Miss United States Teen titles. She was stripped of the latter title after appearing nude in the November 2004 issue of Playboy magazine. She has been the subject of several celebrity gossip stories, including a brief engagement to singer Aaron Carter, a quarrel with singer Mindy McCready, and the leak of a controversial home video involving actors Eric Dane and Rebecca Gayheart. She is also well known to television audiences for her appearances on the first season of Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew, the third season of Celebrity Rehab, and a brief appearance on the second season of Sober House. Early life and modeling career  Peniche was born in San Diego, California on March 20, 1984. Her mother, Lee Ann Rosenbarger, is a business consultant. Peniche has two younger brothers. After their parents divorced, the three siblings lived with their mother, who was an extreme perfectionist (especially about schoolwork). Peniche attended a modeling class at age twelve. After briefly moving the family to Houston, Texas, Peniche's mother remarried and moved them to a home on Blue Lake in Fairview, Oregon. At age 16, Peniche won a six-week contract to model in Korea. She returned for another six-week stint at age 18. Peniche attended Portland Lutheran High School in Gresham, Oregon, where she was a cheerleader. She graduated in 2002, and later attended Portland State University and took classes through UCLA Extension. In a 2008 interview with Steppin' Out magazine, Peniche claimed that she was sexually abused as a minor, teenage model, and beauty queen; also physically abused by a former boyfriend. Career Peniche won the Miss Oregon Teen USA 2002 title in November 2001. She competed in the Miss Teen USA 2002 pageant but did not place. At the end of her reign she crowned Tami Farrell as the new Miss Oregon Teen USA. The following year she represented Oregon in the Miss United States Teen pageant, which she won. She was crowned November 10, 2003 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Peniche was considered an unconventional pageant winner, for her fashion and career choices. She was later stripped of her Miss United States Teen title after appearing nude in Playboy magazine. Peniche stated that she did not think there would be any issue, since: she claimed that nothing in her beauty pageant contract prohibited her from doing nude modeling; and, her Playboy issue was not published for sale until after her reign had ended. Peniche went on to host Xtreem, a Seattle-based, cable television program featuring local bands and extreme sports; and, the Boom Boom Huck Jam event. She acted in Small Change, an independent film produced in Seattle, and has appeared in other movies and TV shows.Kari Ann Peniche on IMDB She also launched a line of bikinis called \\"Strung Out\\" at Portland Fashion Week.Strung Out Girl by Peniche Personal life In September 2006 Aaron Carter, then 18 years old, proposed to Peniche while they were onstage in Las Vegas, Nevada. They had known each other five days. Peniche, who had previously dated his older brother Nick, agreed. The engagement was broken off six days later. On August 17, 2009, a home video was posted on the website Gawker showing Peniche with married actors Eric Dane and Rebecca Gayheart. All three are naked, though the video does not contain any sex acts. Though it is unknown how the video was made public, it had been stored on a hard drive that was the subject of a dispute between Peniche and Mindy McCready during their time on Celebrity Rehab. Starting in November 2009, Peniche appeared as a patient on the VH1 reality television spinoff series, Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew (a documentary about the treatment process for sexual addiction patients [filmed in April 2009] at the Pasadena Recovery Center). Peniche described herself as having had hundreds of lovers, but being unable to emotionally connect with anyone in any kind of relationship. Peniche's participation in the treatment program was marred by her aggressive and erratic behavior: verbally abusing the staff and other patients; refusing to participate in group discussions, or obey the clinic's rules; forcefully demanding that the staff fetch her fruit juice and bring it to her bedside; accusing people of laughing at her when they clearly were not; and, compulsively smiling (as a beauty pageant contestant might, in order to maintain a facade of well-being) -- even when discussing her own past traumas and pain. Dr. Drew Pinsky, the treating physician, became suspicious that she was using illicit substances such as methamphetamine, or had been prior to being admitted. The PRC's staff psychiatrist diagnosed her as having borderline personality disorder (BPD). It was indicated that both the substance abuse and BPD had to be treated before any treatment for sexual addiction could begin. Eventually, Peniche was involuntarily discharged for failing to comply with the program's guidelines. She refused Pinsky's offer of an alternative program at a nearby psychiatric hospital, and during the process of being evicted from her home, she made suicidal gestures and became abusive toward the show's production staff (e.g., throwing a container of water onto a technician). Later, during production of the third season of Celebrity Rehab, Peniche contacted Pinsky for help. Pinsky explained that her aggressive behavior during Sex Rehab was derived from drugs she smuggled into the PRC in her teddy bear; and, were difficult to detect during drug testing because of the medication Peniche took for attention deficit disorder. Pinsky went to her residence, where Peniche showed him the crystal meth she was using. She was shown returning to the Pasadena Recovery Center at the end of that season's fourth episode. Executive producer John Irwin claimed that her behavior changed by her second appearance, although she did allegedly punch a cameraman, at one point.Press release In her second stint at the Pasadena Recovery Center, Peniche again exhibited some problematic behaviors (including conflict with the staff and other patients, plus again violating facility rules); however, she did complete the program. Peniche joined the cast of Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House, in which she transferred into a sober living facility (often an interim step between rehab, and returning to society). In the first episode, she became verbally abusive toward the sober living manager (Jennifer Gimenez), and tested positive for methamphetamine.Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House; Season 2, Episode 1; VH1; Premiered March 11, 2010 During the second episode, admitted being worried that her former Rehab co-star, Mindy McCready (whom Peniche had invited to move in with her at the end of their season on Rehab‚Äîan idea that Dr. Pinsky openly opposed) had access to sensitive materials on Peniche's computer. (It was later reported that the two argued over money, and, an accusation over a stolen hard drive [containing the nude video featuring Peniche, Eric Dane, and Rebecca Gayheart]). As Peniche was being filmed returning home to address this matter, she punched a cameraman in the eye, and was evicted from the sober living facility.Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House; Season 2, Episode 2; VH1; Premiered March 18, 2010 A few days later, Head Counselor Bob Forrest brought Peniche back to the facility to see if the residents would accept her return; but, (with the exception of co- patient/-resident Tom Sizemore), the residents declined Peniche's in-person plea to return, and she left amid stinging criticism by Heidi Fleiss.Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House, Season 2, Episode 3; Premiered March 25, 2010. Peniche wed investment builder Justin Williams in February 2011 in Los Angeles, California and they have two children together, a son named Preston and a daughter named Layla. Their marriage has been strained, reportedly due to Peniche's behavior, both past and present; her husband has made allegations of infidelity against her and of child abuse, saying a hair follicle test showed she'd exposed their then 10-month-old son to methamphetamine.http://www.tmz.com/2012/07/25/kari-ann-peniches-estranged- husband-exposed-baby-meth/ ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Beauty pageant controversies Category:Entertainers from Oregon Category:Miss Teen USA 2002 delegates Category:People from San Diego Category:People from Multnomah County, Oregon Category:People with borderline personality disorder Category:American expatriates in South Korea Category:Female models from Oregon ","title":"Kari Ann Peniche"},{"id":"3179595","title":"Driftwood (Travis song)"},{"id":"3179606","text":"Alexander I of Alexandria, 19th Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria. During his patriarchate, he dealt with a number of issues facing the Church in that day. These included the dating of Easter, the actions of Meletius of Lycopolis, and the issue of greatest substance, Arianism. He was the leader of the opposition to Arianism at the First Council of Nicaea. He also is remembered for being the mentor of the man who would be his successor, Athanasius of Alexandria, who would become one of the leading Church fathers. Biography Comparatively little is known about Alexander's early years. During his time as a priest, he experienced the bloody persecutions of Christians by Emperors Galerius and Maximinus Daia. Alexander became patriarch on the passing of Achillas of Alexandria, whose own remarkably short reign was thought by some to have been brought about by his breaking the command of his own predecessor, Peter of Alexandria, to never readmit Arius into communion.Atiya, Aziz S.. The Coptic Encyclopedia. New York:Macmillan Publishing Company, 1991. . Alexander himself faced three primary challenges during his patriarch term. The first of these was a schismatic sect, led by Erescentius, which disputed the timing of Easter. Alexander found himself put in the position of writing a special treatise on the controversy, in which he cited earlier statements regarding the matter by Dionysius of Alexandria. Alexander's own efforts, while they did serve to quiet the dispute, were not enough to quiet the controversy themselves, although the First Council of Nicaea, held during his tenure, did resolve the matter. Meletius of Lycopolis His second major concern was the matter of Meletius of Lycopolis, who continued to slander Alexander, as he had earlier done to Achillas. Meletius went so far as to lodge a formal complaint with the court of the Emperor Constantine I, although no unusual attention was given it. More important, however, was the fact that Meletius had seemed to establish some form of working alliance with Arius. Meletius also consecrated bishops of his own, without his superior's consent. This controversy would continue unabated until the Council at Nicaea, where Alexander allowed Meletius to return to the church, effectively ending Meletius' alliance with Arius. Arianism The last, and most important, of the problems Alexander faced was the issue of Arius himself. Alexander's predecessor, Achillas, had not only allowed Arius to return to the church, but had given him the oldest church in Alexandria, a position which allowed him to exercise a great influence on the Christian community of Alexandria. In fact, Arius was even a contender for the post of patriarch of Alexandria at the death of Achillas. The conflict between the two began in earnest when Alexander declared the unity of the Trinity in one of his sermons. Arius immediately responded by labeling Alexander's statement Sabellianism, which had already been rejected by that time. The controversy quickly escalated, and Arius developed ever increasing support for his position, winning over a number of deacons, and at least one presbyter, who started to ordain presbyters of his own. Arius continued to draw even more attention and support, to the point that Alexander found himself having to summon two separate assemblies of his priests and deacons to discuss the matter. Neither of these assemblies, though, reached any firm conclusions, or helped to limit the spread of Arius' beliefs. Alexander then called a synod of the church of Alexandria and its neighboring province of Mareotis in 320, for the specific intention of deciding what action would be taken regarding this increasingly problematic matter. At the synod, thirty-six presbyters and forty-four deacons, including Athanasius of Alexandria, agreed to a condemnation of Arianism and signed a document to that effect. Arius remained successful in spreading his new belief elsewhere, particularly in Mareotis and Libya, where Arius convinced the bishop Secundus of Ptolemais and Thomas of Marmarica to join him. Arius' success in dividing the leaders of the church made the chance of a formal schism a very real one. In 321, Alexander called a general council of the entire church of the nation. The council gathered no fewer than one hundred participants. At this council, Arius continued to argue his earlier position, that the Son could not be co-eternal with the father, and even went on to say that the Son was not similar to the Father in substance. This last statement was received with horror by the assembled council, who placed Arius under anathema until he recanted his positions. Arius left for Palestine, where he received support from a number of bishops, who expressed their opinion of the matter to Alexander. One of these supporters, Eusebius of Nicomedia, had close connections with the imperial court in Byzantium, and helped to spread Arius' ideas further. The widespread growth of this movement, and the reaction to such from the established church, led to the emperor himself writing a letter to the involved parties calling for the return of unity to the church and an end to this protracted dispute about what he characterized as petty arguments over unintelligible minutiae. Arius' followers in Alexandria began to engage in violence in defense of their beliefs, prompting Alexander to write an encyclical to all of his brother bishops in Christendom, in which he related the history of Arianism and his opinion of the flaws of the Arian system. In doing so, he was obliged to indicate to them the actions of Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had assembled a provincial council of the church of Bithynia to discuss Arius. This body reviewed the actions that Alexander and his predecessors had taken, and, based on their review, formally admitted Arius to the communion of the Syriac church. Other figures, including Paulinus of Tyrus, Eusebius of Caesarea, and Patrophilus of Scythopolis, also indicated their support of Arius, allowing his followers to assemble for the Divine Office as they had earlier done in Alexandria. Arius is believed to have written his Thalia at around this time, which gathered even more support for his cause. This book, combined with Arius' other works and Alexander's opposing works, exacerbated the dispute between the supporters and opponents of Arius. In this atmosphere and on the advice of his deacon Athanasius, Alexander wrote in defense of his own position a confession of faith. He sent this tome to all the bishops of Christianity, asking them to endorse his position by placing their own signatures on the copies. He received about 250 signatures to his work, including about 100 from his own diocese, as well as 42 from Asia, 37 from Pamphylia, 32 from Lycia, 15 from Cappadocia, and various others. He also maintained individual correspondence with Alexander of Constantinople, protesting the violence of the Arians and promulgation of Arius's views on the influence of females, as well as with Pope Sylvester I, Macarius of Jerusalem, Asclepius of Gaza, Longinus of Ashkelon, Macarius of Ioannina, Zeno of Tyrus, and many others on the issues of Arianism. The dispute over Arianism had become a serious problem, which threatened to damage the peace and unity of the church and of the empire. Constantine, now sole claimant to the throne after the execution of Licinius, wrote a letter \\"to Athanasius and Arius\\". Constantine wrote the letter from Nicomedia, so some have concluded that Eusebius of Nicomedia, the bishop of Nicomedia and a supporter of Arius, may have been involved in the composition of the letter. The letter was given to Hosius of C√≥rdoba, a respected older bishop, to deliver to the disputants in Alexandria. In the letter, Constantine requested that Alexander and Arius end their dispute. Shortly after receiving the message from Constantine, Alexander requested another general council of the diocese, which seems to have confirmed its agreement with the profession of faith Alexander had earlier circulated an agreement to the use of the theological term \\"consubstantial\\". It also reaffirmed the excommunication of Arius and the condemnation of the followers of Meletius, which, of course, angered the Arians of Alexandria even more. Arius himself formally complained to the emperor over his treatment by Alexander. In response, Constantine called for Arius to plead his case before an ecumenical council of the church, to be held at Nicaea in Bithynia on 14 June 325, the first such council ever called into existence. First Council of Nicaea Alexander came to the council with a party which included Potamon of Heraclea, Paphnutius of Thebes, and Alexander's deacon, Athanasius, who acted as his spokesman. Alexander was himself supposed to preside over the meeting, but felt that he could not serve as both presiding official and chief accuser. On that basis, he turned over the presidency to Hosius of Cordova. After lengthy discussion, the council issued a decision which, among other things, confirmed the anathema of Arius, authorized Alexander, at his urging, to allow Meletius to retain his episcopal title, but not be able to exercise any episcopal powers. Those Meletius had appointed could also retain their titles, but would only be elevated to the status of bishop on the death of one of the bishops consecrated by Alexander. It also gave Alexander the right to decide the timing of Easter on his own, asking him only to communicate his decision to Rome and the rest of Christendom. It also issued a statement that the Egyptian church would be allowed to retain its traditions regarding clerical celibacy. In this regard, Alexander followed the advice of Paphnutius of Thebes, who encouraged him to allow priests to be married after taking holy orders. Five months after returning to Alexandria from Nicaea, Alexander died. One source places his death on the 22nd of Baramudah, or April 17. As he was dying, he is said by some to have named Athanasius, his deacon, as his successor. Writings Several of the works which we are told to have been written by Alexander have not survived. History mentions a collection of letters he wrote regarding the Arian controversy. Only two of these letters survive to this day. There is also an extant homily, De anima et corpore (On the soul and the body) which is attributed to Alexander in a Syriac version. The Coptic version however attributes the homily to Athanasius. Another work, the Enconium of Peter the Alexandrian, is attributed to him. This book survives in five codices. The work can be reconstructed based on the extant fragments and a translation in the History of the Patriarchs. It contains the biblical allusions, traditions, and portrayal of the martyrdom of Peter. It has been said to be one of the best examples of the literary style of the time, based on its complex literary structure, the competency of its theology, and general literary style. Veneration Alexander is venerated as a saint in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Roman Catholic Church. Alexander is described by the Roman Catholic Church as \\"a man held in the highest honor by the people and clergy, magnificent, liberal, eloquent, just, a lover of God and man, devoted to the poor, good and sweet to all, so mortified that he never broke his fast while the sun was in the heavens.\\" See also * Pope Saint Alexander I of Alexandria, patron saint archive NotesReferences * * External links *English translations of Alexander's extant correspondence from Fourth-Century Christianity Category:Year of birth unknown Category:320s deaths Category:4th- century archbishops Category:4th-century Christian saints Category:4th-century Romans Category:Deans of the Catechetical School of Alexandria Category:Saints from Roman Egypt Category:Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria Category:Popes of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria Category:Romans from Africa ","title":"Pope Alexander I of Alexandria"},{"id":"3179609","text":"Richard Glover is an Australian talk radio presenter, journalist and author.

Biography Stringer began his career from the late 1970s with a series of fanzines, many featuring his popular Brickman character; these were read by several professional creators (including Kevin O'Neill, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons) who encouraged Stringer to try comics as a profession and Stringer recalls that \\"Alan Moore actually introduced me to one of the editors at Marvel UK ‚Äì Bernie Jaye who was editor on The Daredevils\\". He sold his first professional cartoon to Marvel UK (the British branch of Marvel Comics) in 1983 where it appeared in The Daredevils comic, after which he worked for a short time as art assistant to the cartoonist Mike Higgs (creator of Moonbird and The Cloak). Since then Stringer has freelanced for numerous British comics for various companies and audiences. His best remembered creations are Tom Thug and Pete and His Pimple for Oink! comic (1986), which outlasted that comic and continued into Buster comic, and Combat Colin the halfwit hero who featured in Action Force and The Transformers comics. Prior to Colin joining Transformers, Stringer had written another, similarly slapstick, strip Robo-Capers for that title. Robo-Capers was replaced by Combat Colin when the reprints of American G.I. Joe strips were added to the Transformers comic. Robo-Capers returned for a single story, which featured Colin and his sidekick, in Issue No. 200. After a change of editorial direction in 1991, Marvel UK handed the rights of Combat Colin to Stringer and he has used him in small-press titles, such as the Combat Colin Special and Yampy Tales. On 30 September 2012, Combat Colin returned in an all-new story for the launch of new David Lloyd's new online comic Aces Weekly and two other new stories featuring the character have appeared there since. Stringer has also worked as a writer on CiTV Tellytots; was one of the main writers on Sonic the Comic, where he created several fan-favourite characters and stories; and has been a long time artist/writer for Viz and many other publications. He has written Toxic!'s Team TOXIC! strip since the first issue (and drawn it since issue 15); this proved popular enough with the readers to gain two pages an issue and lead to other comic strips being brought in. In October 2012 reprints of Team Toxic began to appear in the magazine but brand new stories resumed in January 2014, concluding in February 2019. He broke into the international market in 1997 creating the Suburban Satanists for the Norwegian comic Geek. From 1999 to 2007 those characters appeared in the Swedish comic book Herman Hedning. In April 2005, Active Images published a collection ‚Äì Brickman Begins ‚Äì of all of Stringer's Brickman strips since 1979. In 2006, a brand new Brickman series began in the American comic book Elephantmen, published by Image Comics, and in 2007, Combat Colin became a guest star in the strip. The series concluded in Elephantmen No.24 in 2009. In September 2015 Stringer reprinted all 20 episodes in a self-published comic entitled Brickman Returns. Stringer has since self-published other comics that reprint his older material, such as a Derek the Troll / Rock Solid special and a Combat Colin mini-series. He began freelancing for The Beano in 2007, drawing a Fred's Bed story for the Christmas issue and a one-off Ivy the Terrible strip for an issue in 2008. In October 2008 Stringer became the artist on a new strip, Super School which is about five superhero children and their non-superpowered teacher. He started drawing for The Dandy after its revamp in October 2010, providing the illustrations for Postman Prat and Kid Cops and writing and drawing The Dark Newt. In 2014 Lew announced that he would be contributing a regular new cartoon strip to Doctor Who Magazine. In recent years Lew has scripted and illustrated Rasher and Joe King (The Beano) for The Beano and in 2018 began work on a revival of Big Eggo for that comic.

The 137th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16, 2005. In the episode, Stan joins Scientology in an attempt to find something \\"fun and free\\". After the discovery of his surprisingly high \\"thetan levels\\", he is recognized as the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the church. The episode was written and directed by series co- creator Trey Parker. The title is a reference to the R. Kelly serialized song of the same name and a satirized version of R. Kelly appears in the episode. \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" generated significant controversy. Tom Cruise, who is portrayed in the episode, reportedly threatened to back out of his promotional obligations for the Paramount Pictures film Mission: Impossible III if Viacom, the owner of both Comedy Central and Paramount, allowed a repeat airing of the episode. A publicist of Cruise denied this, saying \\"Tom had nothing to do with this matter. He's been promoting Mission: Impossible III for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from.\\" Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast on March 15, 2006, the episode \\"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\\" was shown instead. Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes, but South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone thought otherwise; they issued a satirical statement saying they (Parker and Stone) were \\"servants of the dark lord Xenu\\". Hayes, the voice of staple character Chef, asked to be released from his contract shortly before the start of the tenth season. The reason for his departure, as reported by Stone, was due to his membership in Scientology and this episode, which Hayes‚Äîdespite initially supporting the show's satirical take on several talk shows‚Äîclaimed was very offensive. The episode has since been rebroadcast on Comedy Central multiple times. \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" was nominated for an Emmy Award in July 2006, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category. The episode was featured among Comedy Central's list of \\"10 South Parks That Changed The World\\", spoofed by Conan O'Brien in the opening segment of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, and mentioned in the Scientology critique film The Bridge. TV Guide ranked the episode #17 on its list of \\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\\".  Plot  Stan takes a free \\"personality test\\" offered by Scientologists on the street. After answering a long questionnaire, Stan is informed that he is extremely depressed and therefore a perfect candidate for Scientology. They offer to help him out for $240. Back home, Stan asks his parents for the money. His father suggests that he use the money he had been saving for a bicycle. Stan pays the Scientologists and is taken into an auditing room where an attendant reads his \\"thetan levels\\" using an \\"E-meter\\". Stan has such a high reading that the Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles is notified. There, the president of Scientology determines that Stan's high reading makes him a reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology's founder and prophet. Later that night, a group of Scientologists, including John Travolta, gather outside the Marsh house to celebrate Hubbard's \\"second coming\\". The president of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan's parents. They are opposed to Stan's participation, but the president informs them that \\"we're not asking him to join us; we're asking him to lead us\\". Randy sends Stan to his room, where he finds Tom Cruise waiting. Cruise asks him whether Stan has enjoyed his acting. When \\"Hubbard\\" replies that his acting is okay but not as good as others' such as Leonardo DiCaprio or the Napoleon Dynamite guy, Tom hears that he is \\"a failure in the eyes of the prophet\\" and locks himself in Stan's closet. He refuses to come out, despite the protests of Randy, Nicole Kidman, the police, Travolta and R. Kelly to \\"come out of the closet\\". Travolta and Kelly eventually join Cruise in the closet. Downstairs, the church president tries to convince Stan's parents to allow their son to participate. He tells to Stan the great secret behind the church‚Äîa condensed version of the story of Xenu, according to the Scientology Operating Thetan III document. During this, an onscreen caption reads \\"This is what Scientologists actually believe\\". He then begs Stan to continue writing where \\"L. Ron\\" left off. Stan is impressed by the story and shows his writings to the president who initially approves of the work. Stan suggests that \\"to really be a church, you can't charge money to help\\", to which the president admits to Stan that the church is in reality a global money-making scam. He asks that Stan continue with that in mind. Stan appears to agree and keeps writing. Outside the house, the president introduces Stan to his followers, where he will read parts of his new doctrine. However, instead of presenting it to them, Stan states that he is not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and that \\"Scientology is just a big fat global scam\\". The Scientologists and celebrities in the closet are angry and threaten to sue Stan. Stan dares them to sue, and the episode ends. The closing credits name only \\"John Smith\\" and \\"Jane Smith\\", a reference to Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology's reputation for litigiousness.  Production  South Park had previously parodied Scientology in a spoof at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The MTV short was titled \\"The Gauntlet\\" and included \\"John Travolta and the Church of Scientology\\" arriving in a spaceship to defeat Russell Crowe (as a gladiator) and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film Battlefield Earth. They had also made fun of Scientology in an earlier episode, titled \\"Super Best Friends\\", in which David Blaine formed his own cult, called \\"Blaintology\\". Parker and Stone have acknowledged that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology.Episode Commentary on South Park: Season 5 DVD boxset. Parker stated that Isaac Hayes' membership had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology. However, the decision to ultimately produce a South Park episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show's creators have with Penn Jillette. Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of Bullshit! based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology. Parker commented, \\"We're going, That's fucked up. And hearing other people say, 'You can't do that' ‚Äì you can only say 'You can't do that' so many times to Matt and me before we're gonna do it. Finally, we just had to tell Isaac, 'Dude, we totally love working with you, and this is nothing personal, it's just we're South Park, and if we don't do this, we're belittling everything else we've ripped on. Although some questions were raised prior to the episode's screening about whether it was wise to take swipes at Cruise and Scientology, Comedy Central declared that it supported Stone and Parker. A Comedy Central spokesman told Radar magazine in November 2005 that \\"they are free, and have been, to satirize anybody and anything they want to. They've made fun of MTV, they've made fun of Viacom, they've made fun of Comedy Central, and we've never interfered with them.\\" During production on the episode, investigative journalist Mark Ebner served as a consultant to Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood, Interrupted, which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood, and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta's relationship to Scientology. On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode, it is asserted that the section of \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" that explains Scientology's portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated: \\"Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously.\\" The title is a reference to the R. Kelly song of the same name, and a depiction of R. Kelly appears in the episode to sing a parody of it.  Controversy = Isaac Hayes' departure  Isaac Hayes was the voice of Chef on South Park On March 13, 2006, Hayes, a Scientologist himself, announced that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, \\"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices.\\" The Guardian observed that the show had mocked most other religions, but that he drew the line at Scientology. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, \\"Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do.\\" Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone asserted that \\"This is 100 percent having to do with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem‚Äîand he's cashed plenty of checks‚Äîwith our show making fun of Christians.\\" According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had \\"heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.\\" Stone commented that \\"In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well.\\" According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused. There were many conflicting stories as to the exact nature of Hayes' departure. Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include \\"They didn't pay me enough\\", and \\"They weren't that nice\\". In late 2007, reports emerged claiming that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January. According to a Fox News article, Hayes' agent Christina Kimball, herself a practicing Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park. Stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, commenting that \\"There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him, and I believe it... It was a brutal, up-close, personal thing with Isaac. If you look at the timeline, something doesn't add up.\\" Due to the absence of Hayes, Chef was voiced in \\"The Return of Chef\\" using pre-recorded snippets of dialog from previous episodes. The character was written out of the series by being struck by lightning, burned, impaled, shot, and mauled at the end of the episode.  Tom Cruise parody  The creators used the ambiguity of \\"coming out of the closet\\", having Tom Cruise literally refusing to come out of Stan's closet, in a parody of rumors that Cruise was homosexual. Cruise has a documented history of litigation against others involving rumors as to his sexuality, and some speculated whether Cruise could sue South Park. Entertainment Weekly asked in December 2005 whether South Park was \\"cruisin' for a bruisin'\\" and wondered \\"how that sort of Cruise-bashing is going to go over with Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's new bosses: Paramount Pictures just inked the dudes to a three-year deal. Other people with Paramount deals? Oh, just, you know, Tom Cruise. Should be one hell of a studio Christmas party\\". Concerns over possible litigation were raised in other countries where South Park is syndicated. The episode's planned screening on the UK's Paramount Comedy 1 channel was canceled for fear that Cruise would sue. In Australia, SBS TV screened the episode in late February, a spokesman telling Australian The Daily Telegraph that \\"We haven't received any legal threats so we're going to publish and be damned.\\"  Closetgate  Trey Parker, one of the co-creators of South Park This episode was scheduled to rebroadcast on March 15, 2006, on Comedy Central, but the broadcast was canceled without prior notice, and was replaced with \\"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\\". Representatives of Comedy Central insist that the episode was changed as a tribute to Isaac Hayes following his departure from the show two days earlier. The following day, the Hollywoodinterrupted.com blog alleged that Comedy Central parent Viacom canceled the rebroadcast due to threats of Cruise to boycott the publicity tour of his upcoming film Mission: Impossible III. These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning. Fox News attributed threats from Tom Cruise, stating, \\"to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn't pull a repeat of the episode\\", as evidence of \\"bad blood\\" between Cruise and Viacom (which also owns Paramount Pictures, the distributor of MI:III). CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer also cited \\"industry sources\\" who believed the episode was pulled \\"because the network and Tom Cruise's current movie studio are both owned by the same corporation.\\" The New York Post noted that Cruise had \\"a history of playing hardball\\", alleging that he had been responsible for having a sex scene featuring his then-fianc√©e Katie Holmes removed from the film Thank You for Smoking prior to its release. The Washington Post reported that South Park fans \\"struck back\\", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" back on its schedule. Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the Mission: Impossible III box office debut. The South Park creators did not comment directly on Comedy Central's decision to pull the episode, reportedly because they had been told not to discuss the matter to avoid embarrassing Cruise. Instead, they issued a statement to Variety on March 17, 2006, signing the statement, \\"Trey Parker and Matt Stone, servants of the dark lord Xenu\\". The Los Angeles Times dubbed the controversy surrounding the episode's rebroadcast \\"Closetgate\\". The Independent later cited the Los Angeles Times, noting that the controversy generated positive publicity for the show's creators: \\"For Stone and Parker, Closetgate will be the gift that keeps on giving.\\" \\"Closetgate\\" has since been used to refer to the \\"brouhaha\\" surrounding Isaac Hayes' departure and rebroadcasts of the episode, by other sources including Yahoo! Movies, BBC, Turner Classic Movies, the Herald-Sun, Thoralf Fagertun of the University of Troms√∏, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Cruise's representative responded to the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were \\"not true\\" and that \\"he never said that\\". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that \\"Tom had nothing to do with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from.\\" Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, \\"First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'\\" In April 2006, TelevisionWeek reported that fans had posted the episode in multiple locations on the internet. At that time, the episode had been viewed over 700,000 times on YouTube, and an online petition to re-air the episode had garnered 5,000 signatures. TelevisionWeek noted that Comedy Central \\"looked the other way at the online proliferation\\" of \\"Trapped in the Closet\\". A spokesman for MTV Networks, owner of Comedy Central, confirmed they had not asked YouTube to pull the episode from their site. The Situation Room also noted that clips from the episode were still available on Comedy Central's web site. In May 2006, \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" was shown in London, at the National Film Theatre. The free screening was followed by a discussion with Parker and Stone, who said the screening was a \\"display of free speech\\". Free copies of the episode were given out to attendees after the screening. \\"C'mon Jews, show them who really runs Hollywood\\" ‚Äì Comedy Central advertisement, Variety, August 1, 2006 On July 19, 2006, Comedy Central did air a rebroadcast of the episode at 10:00 Pacific Time and did so again on July 23 at 11:00pm Eastern Time and on September 24 at 10:00 PM Eastern time. Matt Stone stated \\"If they hadn't put this episode back on the air, we'd have had serious issues, and we wouldn't be doing anything else with them.\\" After the episode was scheduled to be rebroadcast, Trey Parker and Matt Stone were interviewed on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, where they stated that all of the controversy increased publicity for the episode. Parker was quoted: \\"But it's really like a publicist couldn't have orchestrated this any better for us. You know what I mean? It's like it's been phenomenal. Tom Cruise has done more for South Park than anyone I think in the world.\\" Parker and Stone depicted spray painting graffiti on the church's Los Angeles organization sign as a reference to the controversy. The episode was released in several DVDs, including South Park the Hits: Volume 1 and South Park: The Complete Ninth Season, in contradiction with an alleged request by either the Church of Scientology or Cruise to never put the episode on DVD format. The full episode is also available for viewing on the web site of South Park Digital Studios, along with Parker and Stone's 'mini-commentary' on it. A few references have been made by the show and Comedy Central to Scientology as an aftermath of the controversy. On August 1, 2006, Comedy Central placed an advertisement in Variety showing the South Park stars against a background of L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology Celebrity Center, with the headline, \\"C'mon Jews, show them who really runs Hollywood.\\" Although often misunderstood by the public to parody the Mel Gibson DUI incident, the advertisement actually congratulates South Park on gaining an Emmy nomination for \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" and satirizes the cancellation of the episode's rebroadcast in March. The Rolling Stone cover article \\"Still Sick, Still Wrong\\", celebrating the show's anniversary, also referred to the controversy. The article depicted Stone and Parker spray painting graffiti on the church's Los Angeles organization sign, adding \\"Is dum\\" to the Scientology logo and a \\"Hi Tom\\" message with an accompanying depiction of Cartman's head.  Reception  In a review of South Park: The Complete Ninth Season, The Denver Post stated the jokes about Tom Cruise \\"work splendidly and reveal their depth on repeated viewings, much like the show in general.\\" IGN stated that \\"Perhaps the largest weakness of this season is that the most notorious episodes Best Friends Forever and Trapped in the Closet just don't carry the eye-popping impact that they did when they were ripped from the headlines\\", giving the DVD a rating of 7.0. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Matt Stone and Trey Parker \\"probably hit their zenith when they made fun of Tom Cruise and Scientology\\". An article in The Times wrote that South Park \\"infamously satirized\\" texts by L. Ron Hubbard \\"available only to Operating Thetans\\". TV Guide ranked the episode #17 on its 2009 list of \\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\\".\\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\\" TV Guide; June 15, 2009; pp. 34‚Äì49  Analysis  An article in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion referred to the episode as a \\"scathing cartoon parody\\" of the Church of Scientology. University of Delaware philosophy professor Richard Hanley analyzed the mythology of Scientology, as it relates to the episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", in his 2007 book South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating. Hanley called the Xenu story as presented in the episode, \\"utterly ridiculous\\". Hanley went on to delve into a philosophical analysis of the \\"evidential weight\\" of popularity and tradition in determining the \\"robustness\\" of beliefs. Southwest Minnesota State University philosophy professor Robert Arp also analyzed the philosophical and cultural aspects of the episode in his book South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today. Arp analyzed Comedy Central's reaction to the episode itself, in a section of his book entitled \\"2005‚Äì2006: Comedy Central Caves\\". Arp mentions South Park's usage of the onscreen caption‚Äî\\"This is what Scientologists actually believe\\"‚Äîin the episode, noting that the same device was used in the episode \\"All About the Mormons?\\". In referencing this similar use of the onscreen caption device, Arp seemed to point to an inconsistency in the behavior of Comedy Central relative to the episode. He explained, \\"By a long shot, this show was more kind to Scientology than was 'All About the Mormons' to Mormonism.\\" He noted Comedy Central had suggested it would not rebroadcast the episode for the second time, though it later announced on July 12, 2006, that it would.  Awards  The organization Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, founded by Lawrence Wollersheim, named the South Park staff their \\"FACTNet Person(s) of the Year for 2005\\" for this episode. Robert Arp cited the series winning a Peabody Award due to its willingness to criticize intolerance in April 2006 as a \\"special concern for criticizing and countering intolerance\\", and the notion that \\"the Church of Scientology suffers from the widely held perceptions that it seeks to silence former members and others who criticize its beliefs and practices\\", as the motivation behind the episode. Stone and Parker submitted the episode for an Emmy Award, though Stone admitted that \\"We did it to be jerks. A 'fuck you' to Comedy Central.\\" To their surprise the episode was nominated on July 6, 2006, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category, the show's sixth nomination (one of which they won, for 2005's \\"Best Friends Forever\\"). The Simpsons episode \\"The Seemingly Never- Ending Story\\" was the eventual recipient of the award. It was also among Comedy Central's list of \\"10 South Parks That Changed The World\\", which started airing at September 24, 2006, in anticipation of the premiere of the second half of South Park's tenth season.  Legacy  The scene where Cruise enters the closet is referenced in the South Park segment of the opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O'Brien is trying to get to the show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him as he runs into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance, he exits the closet and says, \\"There's someone else in there\\", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then pops out and closes the door. There is a scene in the film The Bridge by Brett Hanover, where two young women looking for a laugh tell a Scientology volunteer they learned about the organization from South Park. The volunteer answers that she has not seen the episode in question, and the two women later leave during the middle of an orientation video. On February 8, 2013, while appearing on the Opie & Anthony Show, Jenna Miscavige Hill, the niece of the Chairman of Scientology, David Miscavige, admitted that she first learned about the story of Xenu from watching this episode.

The middle of the skull of this species is long and low, the alveolar processes of the maxilla, premaxilla and mandible are reduced and the palate narrow. The teeth are small, spaced, and placed farther forward on the skull. The temporal muscles, sagittal, and nuchal crests are weaker compared to other tenrec species.Butler, P. (1941). A Comparison of the Skulls and Teeth of the Two Species of Hemicentetes. Journal of Mammalogy, 22(1), 65-81. doi:10.2307/1374685 Population Threats These tenrecs, H. semispinosus, are threatened primarily by the loss of their natural habitat due to continuous deforestation, as it is with many other animals in the Madagascar region. This species is also being hunted for food. Olson, Link E. ‚ÄúTenrecs.‚Äù Current Biology, Current Biology, 2013, www.cell.com/current- biology/pdf/S0960-9822(12)01324-3.pdf. Behavior=Diet The lowland streaked tenrec is active both during the day and at night. Its diet is made up primarily of earthworms, but they will sometimes prey on other invertebrates as well. They may be seen stamping their feet on the ground with their fore-paws, an adaptation which is believed to increase earthworm activity for easier foraging. Most tenrecs possess a long snout for poking around in the ground to find their food. They are also capable of eating fruit. Reproduction Breeding takes place during October to December and possibly at other times, depending upon local food supply and temperature. The gestation period lasts 58 days, and the female gives birth to usually between 5 and 8 young. The young are weaned at 18 to 25 days. Shelter The streaked tenrec lives in long, shallow burrows which are usually occupied by family groups. Spines as tools H. semispinosus has hard keratinous quills located in the mid-dorsal region that act as a sounding device and is thought to be used for communication between mother and young and/or a warning signal to predators.Endo, H., Koyabu, D., Kimura, J., Rakotondraparany, F., Matsui, A., Yonezawa, T., ... & Hasegawa, M. (2010). A quill vibrating mechanism for a sounding apparatus in the streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus). Zoological science, 27, 427-432. Movement of these quills causes the tips to rub together and create a high frequency sound. These quills are located in a small area of the mid-dorsal region in a group of seven to sixteen arranged in three rows. Five quills run laterally on each side and is flanked by five to six quills being light brown in color. The arrangement and number of quills does not alter during growth and neither does the length. The circumference of the quills however, does change from juvenile to adult. When an individual is aggravated a defense response is produced by erecting its quills laterally and forward and produces sound when the quills vibrate. H. semispinosus has a highly developed sense of smell and this response along with foot stamping is also produced when the odor of a predator is detected.Schunke, A. C., & Zeller, U. (2010). Chondrocranium and dermal bones of the lowland streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus (Afrosoricida, Tenrecidae) and their comparison with Potamogale and other insectivoran-grade placental mammals. Vertebrate Zoology, 60(1), 37-72. This display additionally occurs when males fight for females and when unfamiliar males come across one another. Female encounters however, have tactile contact and then increase the distance between each other. It uses its quills to communicate in two different ways, by raising them in agitation or by rubbing them together in a method known as stridulation ‚Äì best known as the type noise produced by crickets and cicadas. The sound produced is too high to be perceived by human ears. Sound The streaked tenrec is the only mammal known to use stridulation for generating sound, a method more commonly associated with insects and snakes.Bizarre mammals filmed calling using their quills and spiders Due to its rarity, there are not sufficient information regarding the functional-morphological mechanism of the streaked tenrec. The sounding quills are different from the spines and hair and are found in the mid-dorsal region of the streaked tenrec. The arrangement and length are similar throughout the streaked tenrec's life span, making up three rows in its midline area and adjacent areas bilaterally.name=\\"Endo et al 2010\\">Endo, H., Koyabu, D., Kimura, J., Rakotondraparany, F., Matsui, A., Yonezawa, T., ... & Hasegawa, M. (2010). A quill vibrating mechanism for a sounding apparatus in the streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus). Zoological science, 27, 427-432. Cutaneous muscles underneath the quills were confirmed and are known as quill vibrator disc; they are around 16.8 mm long and 8.55 mm in width for an adult. These cutaneous muscles were the apparatus that contribute the vibration of the quills and production of sound for communication. Hideki Endo, [\\"A Quill Vibrating Mechanism for a Sounding Apparatus in the Streaked Tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus)\\"], \\"Zoological Science\\", 2010 Physiology The streaked tenrec has the ability to enter torpor seasonally however, it is dependent on altitude, age, fat stores, and temperature. Torpor for this species generally occurs during June and July and during winter. However, H. semispinosus is a facultative hibernator and will come out of torpor during winter and forage. When foraging the soil and leaf litter is prodded with the tip of the nose until prey is detected. Elongated hands and digit adaptation (digits 2, 3, and 4) are the tenrecs main digging apparatus allowing it to unearth and pull its prey form the earth. The skull has an elongated rostrum with a slender jaw with small spaced dentition placed more forward in the mouth. This species has zalambdodont molars with a dental formula of I 3/3, C 1/1, P 3/3, M 3/3 having a total of 40 teeth. The sagittal crest and nuchal are less prominent in this species and the zygomatic processes are long and slender resulting in less projection from the sides of the skull. The occipital region in this species along with the visceral skeleton are commonly very conservative.

Accident Audrey Santo was the youngest of four children born to Linda and Steve Santo. On August 9, 1987, three-year-old Audrey was playing outside in the driveway with her four-year- old brother Stephen. When Stephen came inside alone, Linda and her twelve- year-old son, Matthew, went to look for Audrey and found her face down in the backyard swimming pool. Matthew dived in and pulled Audrey from the pool, and she was rushed to the hospital. Audrey remained in a coma for about three weeks, in intensive care. According to Linda Santo, doctors recommended she be placed in an institution, but the family wanted her at home. In November, almost four months following the accident, Audrey was brought home. Audrey's father Steve Santo left the family during the weeks after the accident. He returned years later, only to leave again. Health Once she returned home, Audrey required 24-hour nursing care, provided by her devoted family and a team of nurses provided by the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. She breathed through a ventilator and was on a feeding tube for sustenance, taking only communion wafers by mouth. Audrey's family contended that she was in a state called akinetic mutism ‚Äî unable to speak and with limited movement, but fully alert and awake. However, Edward Kaye, the pediatric neurologist who treated her for eight years following the accident, told a Washington Post reporter that \\"the cell death is about as bad as you can get and still be alive. Her EEGs are profoundly abnormal. She has brain stem activity, but very, very little above the brain stem.\\" A coma specialist, Ed Cooper, brought in by Linda Santo to help Audrey communicate with her hands, told CBS's 48 Hours in 1999, \\"If she can become consistent with movements of her hands, down for 'yes,' up for 'no,' or vice versa, it would be meaningful. Right now it's inconsistent.\\" Meƒëugorje The Santo family is Catholic. About a year after the accident, Linda took Audrey to Meƒëugorje,which (inspite of vehement condemnation from the Vatican) is a popular pilgrimage site in the then Yugoslavia, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared periodically to six local Catholics since 1981. This was a difficult and expensive journey with an incapacitated four-year-old child, but Linda believed it would result in Audrey being healed, even bringing a pair of sandals for Audrey to use once she was restored to health. Audrey was present at one of the alleged apparitions. According to her mother, she seemed to be aware, and nodded her head as if to say 'yes'. Linda states that Audrey communicated directly with the Virgin Mary and agreed to become a victim soul. In popular, or folk spirituality, a \\"victim soul\\" is someone who willingly takes on the suffering of others. Per the Bishop's statement, The Roman Catholic Church recognizes only one victim soul, that of Jesus himself. Statement by Most Rev. Daniel P. Reilly, Bishop of Worcester Audrey subsequently went into cardiac arrest and almost died, requiring a medical evacuation back to the United States. Her mother interpreted the child's heart failure as due to the apparition site's proximity to \\"the biggest abortion clinic in Yugoslavia\\". Miracle claims After the family returned from Meƒëugorje, numerous miracles were purported to have occurred in Audrey's bedroom and within the house. The claimed miracles in Audrey's home included icons weeping blood or oil, a bleeding statue of Jesus, blood appearing spontaneously in a tabernacle and on consecrated communion wafers, oil dripping down the walls of the garage, and the Virgin Mary appearing in cloud formations overhead. Linda Santo and a nurse have also claimed that Audrey sometimes bore the stigmata, although this has never been shown in a photograph. Miraculous healings were attributed to Audrey and people with various diseases or injuries claim to have been cured either by visiting Audrey's house or by intercessory prayer offered by others at Audrey's house. As word spread about Audrey, hundreds of visitors began coming to pray for healing near Audrey's bedside. Eventually, the family set up visiting hours and built a window in Audrey's bedroom wall through which visitors could view her. The window was later removed by order of the bishop. Audrey was also on several occasions taken to a nearby college stadium or a large church, for a mass at which she could be viewed by the public. Oil Starting with one painting, and spreading to include many paintings and icons within the home, oil was said to exude from many objects near Audrey, and to spontaneously fill containers. No one ever claimed to have seen the moment of onset of such an event, only the already-oiled item. The oil was collected in cups and given to visitors on cotton balls. A test commissioned by The Washington Post from Microbac Laboratories of Pittsburgh found that sample contained 80 percent corn or soybean oil, and 20 percent chicken fat. Another test done by 20/20 found a sample of the oil to be 75% olive oil, and other tests found different or inconclusive results. Linda Santo agreed in response to a reporter's questioning that it was impossible to prove someone did not apply the oil to the statues, but insisted that she had not done so. Blood During several masses at which Audrey was present, what seemed to be human blood appeared on consecrated communion wafers, or \\"hosts,\\" although as with the oil no one claims they saw the moment the blood appeared. A substance that appeared to be blood also appeared in a chalice at the Santo home, and a statue of Mary appeared to cry blood. There have been no published accounts of tests on the blood. The Washington Post story says that Audrey's pediatrician, John Harding, intended to examine the blood-smeared communion wafer under a microscope but felt that would be blasphemous and decided to use a magnifying glass instead. No findings from this examination are mentioned. In the same story, Linda Santo is quoted as saying, \\"'If there weren't four bleeding hosts,' she asks, 'if there was just a child in a bed, would anyone pay attention to this?'\\" Healing Many people have claimed that visiting Audrey, praying for her intercession, or having others pray or visit on their behalf has resulted in miraculous healing, including Joey Parolisi of Methuen, Massachusetts who claims his mother's prayer at Audrey's bedside healed his injury, although his physician stated that Joey had always had a 75% chance of recovering.Heaney, Joe. \\"Healed man swears by girl's mystical powers.\\" The Boston Herald, November 10, 1997 A Rhode Island mother also claims that an intercessory prayer to Audrey saved her choking daughter. A woman with metastatic breast cancer, Andrea Pearson attributed her improvement to Audrey, although her oncologist attributed the improvement to a medication she had just started taking; Pearson's cancer later spread to the brain. Audrey once had a rash similar to a rash usually experienced by those undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, although Audrey never underwent such therapy. Those around her believed this was evidence that, as a \\"victim soul\\", she had taken on the suffering of some visitor with cancer. Roman Catholic Church's position In 1999, the Bishop of Worcester at the time, Daniel P. Reilly, released his preliminary findings on the case. In that report, the Bishop said that \\"The most striking evidence of the presence of God in the Santo home is seen in the dedication of the family to Audrey.\\" As for the purported miracles, he said \\"I want to underscore that any paranormal occurrences are not miraculous in and of themselves\\". He also stated in regard to the claim that Audrey was a purported \\"Victim Soul\\", \\"We must proceed quite cautiously here, since this term is not commonly used by the Church except for Christ himself who became the victim for our sins and transgressions on the cross.\\" The report further states that \\"The term \\"victim soul\\" is not an official term in the Church. It was used in some circles in the 18th and 19th century when there was a fascination with suffering and death.\\" And with regard to the many pilgrims who were praying to Audrey while she was still alive, he said \\"praying to Audrey is not acceptable in Catholic teaching.\\" Further, it was stated that \\"One should only pray for Audrey. Our faith teaches us to pray to God and to pray for the intercession of the saints. Therefore, the distribution of a \\"Prayer to Audrey\\" should cease immediately.\\" In the case of the purported miracle oil, his report stated: \\"We must be careful not to identify this oil as \\"holy oil,\\" which could be used to anoint a person. The Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, which can only be celebrated by a priest or bishop, uses oil blessed by the bishop at the Mass of Chrism, and is given to those who are seriously ill.\\" The Bishop's report does not confirm any of the alleged miracles and cautions against some of the beliefs being promoted. However, the bishop had nothing but praise for the care Audrey had received from her family. He lauded the \\"excellent care the family gives to their daughter. This has manifested itself in her physical condition, for example, she has not apparently had bedsores in the eleven years she has been confined to her bed.\\" He celebrated their \\"constant love and devotion to their daughter is a miracle in the broad sense of the word. They have always recognized the human dignity of their daughter, despite the circumstances.\\" Above quotes taken from the Diocese Issues Interim Findings on Miraculous Claims, Statement by Most Rev. Daniel P. Reilly, Bishop of Worcester. Application for sainthood A nonprofit foundation is pursuing the process of sainthood for Audrey. The Bishop of Worcester, Robert J. McManus, gave official recognition to the foundation, allowing them to present their application to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome, while remaining neutral himself as to whether Audrey should be a saint. Beatification and canonization will require at least two fully documented and authenticated miracles. The board of directors of the Audrey Santo Foundation asked in a web update on August 12, 2013 that \\"if anyone has specific knowledge of any such miracles, they must come forward [so] that the proper protocol is followed.\\" Death and funeral Whether or not her healing miracles are real, she herself did not receive any such healing, and was bedridden and unable to talk or move until her death on April 14, 2007 from cardio-respiratory failure. Family, friends and clergy were at her side. The vigil was held April 17, 2007 and the funeral mass on April 18, 2007, both at St. Paul's Cathedral in Worcester, Massachusetts. The public was allowed to attend these two events, but the burial was private.

The flight is notable for its graceful motion and unencumbered appearance. The illusion was included in Copperfield's CBS TV special The Magic of David Copperfield XIV: Flying‚ÄîLive The Dream (1992), and has been repeated several times during Copperfield's live tours around the world. The method was created by John Gaughan. An essential contribution to make fluid movements was given by his assistant, dancer and choreographer Joanie Spina. Effect During the trick, Copperfield flies acrobatically on the stage, performs a backflip in midair, and then has spinning hoops passed around him, supposedly to prove that he is not suspended by wires. He then floats down into an acrylic glass box which has previously been examined by two audience members, and continues to float inside after the box is covered. An assistant walks over the top of the box, and Copperfield walks upside down moving his feet under the assistant's feet. He then selects a female volunteer from his audience and flies with her in a fashion similar to Superman carrying Lois Lane. The illusion sometimes ends with a falcon named Icarus grasping Copperfield by the wrist and flying off stage with him. A blue backcloth is used in the background, and the television version uses fake clouds hanging from the ceiling, taking advantage of a larger stage than is used in theatrical appearances. The performance is accompanied by an orchestration called \\"East of Eden Suite\\" by film composer Lee Holdridge, originally written as the theme music for a 1981 miniseries based on the novel East of Eden. Before performing, Copperfield often declares that it took him seven years to develop the performance, and shows a video describing for how long men had dreamed of flying, and how many people before him had tried unsuccessfully. Copperfield performed a much-shortened version of the illusion as the entrance in his sixteenth television special, The Magic of David Copperfield XV: Fires Of Passion, in 1993. The performance used a different background and music, in addition to burning spinning hoops. Method John Gaughan described how the trick works in US Patent #5,354,238. According to the patent, the performer is supported by two fan-shaped arrays of fine wires that remain invisible to the viewing audience. The wires are about mm thick, and support about 10 kg each; the arrays contain more than enough wires to support the performer's weight. The wire arrays are mounted at the hips, near the human center of mass, to a harness worn under the clothing. This creates a balance point facilitating a wide range of movements while suspended. The wires are attached to a complex computer-controlled rig above the stage that maintains the tension in each wire, and keeps each array of wires perpendicular to the audience's line of sight so that the wires never overlap one another, which might allow the audience to see them. Schematic showing moving hoops During the later phases of the performance, two hoops are used simultaneously, which aids the deception as the hoops do not come into contact with the wires. Instead, each ring is brought flush to the wires before being twisted under Copperfield. In the glass box demonstration, the top of the box is threaded between the two sets of wires in a vertical position, before being rotated 90 degrees and lowered into place. The wires remain in place while the performer is in the glass box, passing through crevices between the lid and the sides. Since the box limits movement and he is only able to rotate on one axis, he stays side- on to the front of the audience while in the box. When flying with a volunteer, he holds her in front of him, and she does not come into contact with the set-up.

Postal services In 1901, one of the first Acts of the federal parliament was the Post and Telegraph Act 1901, relying on Section 51(v).. The Act created the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG) which took over the colonial mail systems. The PMG was responsible for telegraph and domestic telephone operations as well as postal mail. In 1975 the Postmaster- General's Department was separated into the Australian Telecommunications Commission (now Telstra) which was responsible for telephone services,. and the Australian Postal Commission (now Australia Post) which was responsible for postal services.. The power also supports the issue of Australian postal stamps. Telephonic services The power has supported Australia‚Äôs regulatory environment for telecommunications in Australia, such as the telecommunications part of the Trade Practices Act. (See Communications in Australia.) ‚ÄúOther like services‚Äù The most problematic part of this power has been the words ‚Äúother like services‚Äù. The High Court has taken a flexible approach to interpreting this provision that has recognised that technology has changed since the constitution was written. In the case of R v Brislan,. in 1935, the High Court decided that s.51(v) included the power to regulate radio broadcasting. However, in Brislan four of the judges held radio to be a wireless type of ‚Äòtelegraphic or telephonic service‚Äô, rather than an ‚Äòother like service‚Äô. In the 1965 case of Jones v Commonwealth (No 2),. the High Court found that television broadcasting also fell under the ambit of s.51(v). Although the communications power is often presumed to apply broadly as new technologies arise, it is uncertain, in the absence of litigation, whether Commonwealth regulation will be supported. For example, it is unclear whether regulation of internet content would be supported under s.51(v). The Commonwealth has already relied on s.51(v) to regulate parts of the internet. For example, the Interactive Gambling Act (Cth), which regulates the operation of online casinos within Australia and advertising of online gambling, was based on s.51(v).. Other forms of gambling are a state and territory responsibility. In March 2013 Australia's accession to the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime came into force following the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (Cth).. The amendments to the Criminal Code which removed the earlier \\"carriage service\\" (telephone and internet) elements of some computer offences (in part 10.7) were apparently supported by the s.51(xxix) external affairs power (arising from obligations under an international treaty). This may mean that ratification of the Convention extended the Commonwealth power in this area beyond the s.51(v) power, avoiding the need to rely on the definition of 'other like services'.

Biography Born in Iesi, Alessandrini graduated from Ancona's Art Institute and begins drawing comics professionally in 1972 for Il Corriere dei Ragazzi with the story Il Cifrario del Maggiore Martin written by Mino Milani. The following year he produced ten episodes of the fantasy series Anni 2000, again written by Milani, and twelve episodes of Lork Shark two years later. In 1975 Alessandrini joined Studio Giolitti and drew several war stories for British publisher Fleetway. He continued his cooperation with Il Corriere dei Ragazzi, drawing two episodes of the series Il Maestro, written by Milani. When in 1976 the editor refused some of the pages for the series asking him to redraw them, Alessandrini decided instead to leave. He then drew Eva Kant for the Italian edition of Cosmopolitan. The series is written by Alfredo Castelli and marks the first of a series of collaborations. In 1976 the two produced L'uomo di Chicago for Bonelli's Un Uomo un'Avventura, then in 1978 they worked together on Allan Quatermain for Supergulp, published by Mondadori and on Mister No, again for Bonelli. Starting in 1977, Alessandrini worked on the western series Ken Parker, written by Giancarlo Berardi. His cooperation will continue until 1980, resulting in six 96 pages episodes. That same year Alessandrini started working for Catholic weekly Il Giornalino, where he drew some episodes of the series Ai confini dell'avventura and Storie di tutti i tempi. In 1981 he created with scriptwriter Claudio Nizzi the series Rosco & Sonny, using himself as a model for Sonny's features. But the opportunity that will make Alessandrini a name in the international comics scene presented itself in 1982: Castelli had convinced Bonelli to greenlight a series based on his new character, and asked Alessandrini to design the character and draw the stories. In April of that year Martin Myst√®re was born. The series was a success, and Alessandrini was to produce all the covers and many of the stories, including specials and spin-offs. In 1990 Alessandrini drew L'Uomo di Mosca, written by Roberto Dal Pr√† for Torpedo magazine. The personal style of the art didn't go unnoticed in France, where publisher Bagheera acquired the rights for the French market. In 1991 Alessandrini and Dal Pr√† created detective Anastasia Brown for Comic Art magazine. The same year Alessandrini was awarded the best artist prize by ANAF. Alessandrini first solo effort was published in 1992 on Comic Art: it's a series of short stories titled Fatti e misfatti a Planet Arium. He then drew the Martin Myst√©re spin-off series Zona X. In 1993 Alessandrini produced three episodes of Indiana Jones for Bagheera. In 2001 he drew Outremer, written by Vincenzo Beretta for French publisher Albin-Michel. \\"Alessandrini plays an important role in the evolution of comics art of the last 15 years.\\" said Alfredo Castelli. \\"He may not realize it, but at the beginning of the 1980s his style has been the trait-d'union between Italian pulp comics and graphic novels, and in the 1990s, he is the only exception in a 'school' that has been dominant for the last 8-10 years.\\" References External links  * Giancarlo Alessandrini at Lambiek Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Iesi Category:Italian comics artists ","title":"Giancarlo Alessandrini"},{"id":"3179693","text":"The Qatar Central Bank () is the central bank of Qatar.

Budini are located at the center top of the map, above the Black Sea The Budini (Ancient Greek: ŒíŒøœÖŒ¥ŒØŒΩŒøŒπ; Boud√≠noi) was a group of people (a tribe) described by Herodotus and several later classical authors. Described as nomads living near settled Gelonians, Herodotus located them east of the Tanais river (which is usually assumed to correspond with modern Don River) beyond the Sarmatians.Herodotus, The Histories, iv. 21. Pliny the Elder mentions the Budini together with the Geloni and other peoples living around the rivers which drain into the Black Sea from the north.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, book 4, XII, 88; Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, trans. John Bostock, book 4, chapter 26 During the European Scythian campaign of Darius I, in which the Persian king invaded the Scythian lands of Eastern Europe, the Budini were allies of the Scythians. During the campaign, he captured and burnt down one of the Budini's large fortified cities. The Budini are also mentioned by Classical authors in connection with reindeer. Both Aristotle and Theophrastus have short accounts ‚Äì probably based on the same source ‚Äì of an ox-sized deer species, named ', living in the land of the Budines in Scythia, which was able to change the colour of its fur to obtain camouflage. The latter is probably a misunderstanding of the seasonal change in reindeer fur colour.Georg Sarauw, \\"Das Rentier in Europa zu den Zeiten Alexanders und C√¶sars\\" [The reindeer in Europe to the times of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar], In Jungersen, H. F. E. and Warming, E.. Mindeskrift i Anledning af Hundredeaaret for Japetus Steenstrups F√∏dsel (Copenhagen 1914), pp. 1‚Äì33.  Herodotus' description  Herodotus gives the following account: Historicity, origin and location The definitive origin or the ethnic composition of Budini - if they indeed existed as a singular entity Herodotus and later authors had described - remains unknown. The general consensus is that the Budini correspond to .Patrushev, V. (1995): Uralic Nations of Russia: Historic Development and Present Condition. pp. 97‚Äì116. Slavic Origin Boris Rybakov was the first to suggest that Budini correspond to , a view now held by the majority of historians. He considered the latter to be ethnically proto-Slavic, and, together with Boris Grakov, further theorised that, considering the probable, relatively large, population numbers of the Budini, which he inferred from the archeological evidence, the Budini must have inhabited a relatively large territory, likely stretching from Voronezh forest steppe to Poltava forest steppe. However, he also did not rule out a possible relation with proto- Balts.–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –†—ã–±–∞–∫–æ–≤ (Borys Aleksandrowicz Rybakow), –ì–µ—Ä–æ–¥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –°–∫–∏—Ñ–∏—è. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∫–æ-–≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ (t≈Ç.

On the other hand, , who also argued that they were proto-Slavic, determined their location at the time of Herodotus to be between the middle Dnepr and the upper reaches of Don river stretching further up to the limits of the Volga river basin. Zbigniew Go≈ÇƒÖb argued that they were a confederation of people who spoke the Proto-Slavic language, from which Greeks inferred their name which was an exonym meaning \\"tribesmen\\" in their native language. Several historians and scholars such as Lubor Niederle and Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik believe that the Budini were a Slavic people, and that the etymology stems from the Slavic word for 'water' \\"Voda\\". Same as Votic, in Finnish Vatja or Russian Voga.James Hastings, \\"Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics\\" (1921), p. 588.  Finno-Ugric Origin  The 1911 edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica surmises that the Budini were Finno-Ugric, of the branch now represented by the Udmurts and Komis.

It has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1974, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The 1974 season was at the time the only season to not produce a Category 5 equivalent typhoon, a feat that would not be matched until 3 years later and 43 years later. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1974 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the \\"W\\" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.

Wanda reached its peak intensity on January 10 as a 65 mph tropical storm. The storm was then downgraded to a tropical depression on January 11. Wanda then dissipated on January 14. Tropical Storm Amy Amy did not strike land. Severe Tropical Storm Babe Babe recurved before landing. Typhoon Carla Carla recurved out at sea. Tropical Depression 05W 5W lasted two days and struck extremely north China. Typhoon Dinah (Bising) Dinah, which developed on June 7, hit Luzon on the 10th as an 80 mph typhoon. It continued northwestward, hit Hainan Island, crossed the Gulf of Tonkin, and dissipated over North Vietnam. Dinah caused 73 casualties (with 33 missing), with $3 million in crop damage (1974 USD). Severe Tropical Storm Emma (Klaring) Emma stayed as a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Freda Fred peaked as a moderate tropical storm. Typhoon Gilda (Deling) When Tropical Storm Gilda, having weakened from a peak of 100 mph winds, crossed between Japan and South Korea in early July, it brought torrential rains and mudslides, killing 128 people (with 26 missing) and causing damage estimated at $1.5 billion (1974 USD). Tropical Storm Harriet (Gading) Harriet did not affect land. Severe Tropical Storm Jean (Heling) Jean stayed weak. Typhoon Ivy (Iliang) 66 people were killed when Typhoon Ivy hit Luzon on July 20, the day before the 1974 Miss Universe was held in Manila. It continued northwestward, and hit southeastern China 2 days later. Severe Tropical Storm Kim Kim recurved. Tropical Storm Lucy (Miding) Lucy hit China. Typhoon Mary The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on August 10. It tracked to the northeast, then turned to the northwest where it became a tropical storm on the 11th. Mary's appearance resembled an extratropical cyclone due to vertical shear, and as the ridge built over Japan, Mary turned more to the west. Conditions were favorable enough for Mary to reach typhoon strength on the 18th, but it weakened to a tropical storm before hitting northeastern China on the 19th. A high pressure system over China forced now Tropical Depression Mary to the southeast, where it restrengthened into a tropical storm on the 24th.

Tropical Depression 16W 16W was just a tropical depression and also hit Thailand for a very brief moment. Severe Tropical Storm Nadine (Norming) Nadine did not make landfall. Typhoon Polly Polly hit Japan and northern China. Tropical Depression 20W 20W hit China. Severe Tropical Storm Rose (Oyang) Rose did not strike land. Typhoon Shirley (Pasing) Shirley was a minimal typhoon. Tropical Storm Trix Trix hit China. Typhoon Virginia Virginia did not hit land. Severe Tropical Storm Wendy (Ruping) Wendy came near Taiwan and The Philippines. Typhoon Agnes Agnes stayed away from land. Typhoon Bess (Susang) Typhoon Bess crossed northern Luzon on October 10, crossed the South China Sea, and hit Hainan Island on the 13th. Bess continued westward, and dissipated over North Vietnam on the 14th. The storm dumped heavy rains on its path, causing 26 deaths (with 3 missing) and $9.2 million (1974 USD) in damage. The name Bess was retired after this season. Typhoon Carmen (Tering) Typhoon Carmen hit Luzon on October 16, just days after Bess hit. It continued northwestward, made landfall on southeastern China, turned south, and dissipated on the 20th. Typhoon Carmen caused sustained storm force winds in Hong Kong and 25 fatalities, with damage estimated at $13 million (1974 USD). Typhoon Della (Uding) Della passed near the Philippines. Typhoon Elaine (Wening) 23 casualties and $21 million in damage can be attributed to 110 mph Typhoon Elaine hitting northern Luzon on October 27. Severe Tropical Storm Faye (Yaning) Faye hit the Philippines and Thailand. Typhoon Gloria (Aning) Glorida moved onshore the Philippines. Tropical Storm Hester Hester formed in the South China Sea. Typhoon Irma (Bidang) The last of the year's 8 typhoons to hit the Philippines made landfall on November 28 as a 100 mph typhoon. Irma, once a 135 mph typhoon, weakened over the islands and restrengthened into a typhoon in the South China Sea. It turned northward, and hit southern China as a weakening tropical storm on December 2, the latest date for a Chinese tropical storm landfall. Irma killed 11 people, and caused $7.3 million in damage (1974 USD). Tropical Storm Judy Judy developed in the South China Sea. Tropical Storm Kit (Delang) Kit developed on December 18th in the open Pacific. Upon hitting the Philippines, the system weakened to a tropical depression. The storm re-intensified to a tropical storm in the South China Sea before dissipating on December 24th.

G. and J. Robinson of London. Her fourth and most popular novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho tells of Emily St. Aubert, who suffers misadventures that include the death of her mother and father, supernatural terrors in a gloomy castle, and machinations of an Italian brigand. Often cited as the archetypal Gothic novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho and Radcliffe's 1791 The Romance of the Forest appear prominently in Jane Austen's 1817 novel Northanger Abbey, where an impressionable young woman reader comes to see friends and acquaintances as Gothic villains and victims, with amusing results.Caroline Webber, \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. 11 October 2008. Accessed 4 June 2011. Plot The Mysteries of Udolpho is a quintessential Gothic romance, replete with incidents of physical and psychological terror: remote crumbling castles, seemingly supernatural events, a brooding, scheming villain and a persecuted heroine. Modern editors note that only about a third of the novel is set in the eponymous Gothic castle, while tone and style vary markedly between sections of the work, to which Radcliffe added extended descriptions of exotic landscapes in the Pyrenees and Apennines, and of Venice, none of which she had visited. For details she relied on travel books, which led her to make several anachronisms. The novel, set in 1584 in southern France and northern Italy, explores the plight of Emily St. Aubert, a young French woman orphaned by the death of her father. She is imprisoned in Castle Udolpho by Signor Montoni, an Italian brigand who has married her aunt and guardian Madame Cheron. He and others frustrate Emily's romance with the dashing Valancourt. Emily also investigates a relationship between her father and the Marchioness de Villeroi, and its connection to Castle Udolpho. Emily St. Aubert is the only child of a landed rural family whose fortunes are in decline. Emily and her father share a notably close bond in a shared appreciation for nature. They grow still closer after her mother's death from illness. She accompanies him on a journey from their native Gascony, through the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean coast of Roussillon, over many mountainous landscapes. During the journey, they encounter Valancourt, a handsome man who also feels an almost mystical kinship with the natural world. Emily and Valancourt fall in love. Emily's father succumbs to a long illness. Emily, now orphaned, is forced by his wishes to live with her aunt, Madame Cheron, who shares none of Emily's interests and shows little affection for her. Her aunt marries Montoni, a dubious nobleman from Italy. He wants his friend Count Morano to become Emily's husband and tries to force him upon her. After discovering that Morano is nearly ruined, Montoni brings Emily and her aunt to his remote castle of Udolpho. Emily fears she has lost Valancourt forever. Morano searches for Emily and tries to carry her off secretly from Udolpho, but Emily's heart still belongs to Valancourt, and she refuses. Morano's attempted escape is discovered by Montoni, who wounds the Count and chases him away. In subsequent months, Montoni threatens his wife with violence, trying to force her to sign over her properties in Toulouse that will otherwise go to Emily on his wife's death. Without resigning her estate, Madame Cheron dies of a severe illness caused by her husband's harshness. Many frightening but coincidental events happen in the castle, but Emily manages to flee with the help of a secret admirer, Du Pont, also a prisoner there, and of the servants Annette and Ludovico. Returning to her aunt's estate, Emily learns that Valancourt has gone to Paris and lost his wealth. Nonetheless, she takes control of the property and is reunited with Valancourt in the end. Characters *Emily St. Aubert: Much of the action takes place from her point of view. Emily has a deep appreciation of the sublimity of nature, shared with her father. She is unusually beautiful and gentle with a slight, graceful figure, fond of books, nature, poetry and music. She is described as virtuous, obedient, resourceful, brave, sensitive, and self-reliant. Her childhood home is La Vall√©e. Her sensitivity leads her to dwell (often in tears) on past misfortunes and imagine with dread troubles that may befall her. She is given to writing verse, selections of which punctuate the novel. *Monsieur St. Aubert: Emily's father, he dies early in the novel while he, Emily and Valancourt are travelling. He warns Emily on his death bed not to become a victim of her feelings, but to acquire command over her emotions. His unaccountable relationship with the Marchioness de Villeroi is one of the novel's mysteries. *Valancourt, younger brother of the Count Duvarney, Valancourt forms an attachment to Emily while travelling with her and her father through the Pyrenees. He is a dashing, enthusiastic young man with a noble character, on furlough from the army when he meets her. St. Aubert sees Valancourt as a desirable match for Emily, although he lacks wealth. *Madame Cheron (later Madame Montoni) is St. Aubert's sister and Emily's aunt. She is a selfish, worldly, vain, wealthy widow living on her estate near Toulouse, when Emily becomes her ward after St. Aubert's death. She is contemptuous and cold, even cruel to Emily at first, thinking solely of herself, but near her death. She softens slightly to Emily, who patiently and selflessly aids and comforts her. *Montoni is a prototypical Gothic villain. Brooding, haughty and scheming, he masquerades as an Italian nobleman to gain Madame Cheron's hand in marriage, then imprisons Emily and Madame Cheron in Udolpho in an attempt to take control of Madame Cheron's wealth and estates. He is cold and often cruel to Emily, who believes him to be a captain of banditti. *Count Morano is introduced to Emily by Montoni, who commands that she marry him. Emily refuses, but Morano still pursues her in Venice and later Udolpho. When Montoni finds that Count Morano is not as rich as he hoped, he abruptly withdraws his support from the suit. Morano tries twice to abduct Emily, but both attempts fail. *Annette, a maid who has accompanied Madame Cheron from France, is talkative and inclined to exaggeration and superstition, but faithful, affectionate and honest. She is in love with Ludovico and often gets locked in closets. *Ludovico, one of Montoni's servants, falls in love with Annette and provides assistance to Emily. He is more sensible than Annette, and is brave and quick-thinking. He is the one who locks the closets. *Cavigni, Verezzi, and Bertolini are cavaliers and friends of Montoni. Cavigini is sly, careful, and flatteringly assiduous. Verezzi is a \\"man of some talent, of fiery imagination, and the slave of alternate passions. He was gay, voluptuous, and daring; yet had neither perseverance or true courage, and was meanly selfish in all his aims.\\" Bertolini is brave, unsuspecting, merry, dissipated and markedly extravagant. His flightiness to Emily distresses her. *Orsino, an assassin described as the \\"chief favourite\\" of Montoni, is cruel, suspicious, merciless and relentlessly vengeful. *Marchioness de Villeroi is a mysterious figure whose miniature Emily finds in a secret panel in her father's closet. She was married to Marquis de Villeroi, but becomes estranged from him and dies through the intervention of Laurentini di Udolpho. She was a sister to M. St. Aubert, and thereby Emily's aunt. *Signora Laurentini di Udolpho (also called Sister Agnes) is a nun in the French monastery of St. Claire. She dies in the final volume of the novel, whereupon she is revealed to be Signora Laurentini, heiress of the house of Udolpho. She has estranged the Marquis de Villeroi, her first love, from his wife, after which she retires to the monastery to live in guilt. She divides her fortune between Emily and the wife of M. Bonnac. *The Marquis de Villeroi was the lover of Laurentini before he married the Marchioness. He leaves the Chateau-le-Blanc after her death. *Francis Beauveau, Count De Villefort is heir to the mansion at Chateau-le-Blanc in Languedoc. He inherits it from his friend the Marquis de Villeroi. He has two children by a previous marriage, Blanche and Henri, and is married to the Countess De Villefort. *Lady Blanche, a sweet young woman with a deep appreciation of the sublime, who writes poetry, resides at Chateau-le-Blanc and befriends Emily, with whom she shares many interests. *Doroth√©e, a servant at the Chateau-le-Blanc, is superstitious like Annette, but less inclined to be found in a closet. *Monsieur Du Pont is one of Emily's suitors. He steals a miniature of Emily belonging to her mother, which he later returns. He helps Emily and her companions escape from Udolpho. He is a friend of De Villefort, who supports his suit. When Emily steadfastly rejects him, he turns his attentions to Blanche, but is thwarted again when she marries St. Foix. *Monsieur Quesnel, Emily's uncle, is cold and unfeeling towards Emily until she becomes an heiress. *Madame Clairval, Valancourt's aunt and an acquaintance of Madame Cheron, initially approves of the match between Valancourt and Emily, but finally decides there are better prospects for both of them. *Monsieur Bonnac, an officer in the French service about 50 years old, Emily meets at the convent. His wife inherits Castle Udolpho. *Monsieur St. Foix, suitor of Blanche, marries her at the end of the novel.

History In ancient times, this area was called \\"the middle of the world\\" (), since it was the center of government for Yu province and lay at the heart of the Nine Provinces. The Duke of Zhou (), the most influential statesman of the early Zhou dynasty, visited Runan many times and termed it as the center of the land. During the Han dynasty, it contributed the most officials to the central government of any commandery, and was ancestral home to the immensely influential Ru'nan Yuan clan. In former times Runan County was at various times called Ancheng County () and Ruyang County (), and Caizhou ()., amongst others. During the Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BC), the vassal State of Dao fell within the borders of the county. The town was the site of a major battle, the siege of Caizhou, in the war between the Mongol Empire and Jurchen Jin dynasty. Emperor Aizong, the Jurchen ruler, had fled to Caizhou after the Jin capital of Kaifeng was captured by the Mongols. He committed suicide in Caizhou and his successor, Emperor Mo, was killed in the besieged town. The Jin dynasty ended in Runan in 1234. Administration Today Runan County falls under the jurisdiction of the prefecture level city of Zhumadian. With a land area of 1306 square kilometres, the county is home to some 770,000 people (2002 figure). The county government is based in the town of Runing (Juning) (). The county of Runan was far larger in Chinese history, but had to surrender a lot of its territories to the nearby city of Zhumadian and counties in the recent centuries. This means that today's Runan is much smaller than it was. Since Runan was famous in Chinese history, many historical relics still could be found in the county seat and within its county boundary. Notably, the Nanhai Chan Temple is famous in the Buddhist world. The site where the Duke of Zhou visited became a historical site as well.

A bollock dagger or ballock knife is a type of dagger with a distinctively shaped hilt, with two oval swellings at the guard resembling male testes (\\"bollocks\\"). The guard is often in one piece with the wooden grip, and reinforced on top with a shaped metal washer. The dagger was popular in Scandinavia, Flanders, Wales, Scotland and England between the 13th and 18th centuries, in particular the Tudor period. Within Britain the bollock dagger was commonly carried, including by Border Reivers, as a backup for the lance and the sword. Many such weapons were found aboard the wreck of the Mary Rose. The bollock dagger is the predecessor to the Scottish dirk. In the Victorian period, weapon historians introduced the term kidney dagger, due to the two lobes at the guard, which could also be seen as kidney-shaped, in order to avoid any sexual connotation.

Publication history The character first appeared in Resurrection Man #1 and was created by Andy Lanning, Dan Abnett and Jackson Guice. Background Resurrection Man was created by British writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning and American artist Butch Guice. The initial idea came to them while working for Marvel Comics in the early 90s. Abnett and Lanning considered reviving the Great Lakes Avengers, a superhero team led by a character called Mr Immortal. They felt that Mr Immortal was boring because immortality was his only power. Lanning thought the character would be more interesting if he gained a different superpower with every resurrection.Abnett & Lanning Revive \\"Resurrection Man\\" - Comic Book Resources When they moved to DC Comics, they proposed the concept to the editors. Mitch Shelley made his debut in Resurrection Man #1 (1997). The character was written as a non-traditional superhero who did not wear a colorful costume or regularly associate with the likes of the Justice League. The book series was written like a TV series, with a grand story arc in which Shelley wanders America in search of the truth behind his past and his transformation. The first volume of Resurrection Man was critically acclaimed but was not a big success. It was cancelled in 1999 after 27 issues, though Mitch kept making occasional guest appearances in other books. In 2011, DC editor Eddie Berganza asked Abnett and Lanning to revive Resurrection Man as an ongoing title. The new series debuted in September 2011, with Fernando Dagnino Guerra as the artist, but was cancelled following year after 13 issues (numbered 1 through 12 with the final issue being numbered 0) due to mediocre sales.DC Cancels Resurrection Man in September. BleedingCool.com. Volume 1 Born in Viceroy, South Carolina, Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Shelley became a lawyer who found himself an unwilling test subject for experimentation in nanotechnology, involving specialized devices nicknamed \\"tektites\\" by an organization known only as \\"the Lab\\". The experiments cost Shelley his memory for several months but also rendered him immortal albeit with a twist: he could still be killed but he would be reborn soon after with a superpower partly influenced by the way he was last killed. A comment by the Phantom Stranger in RM #18 about having worked with Shelley in previous lifetimes suggests that there is more to his powers than just the tektites. However, the series never expanded on this point. Shelley's travels in search of the truth of his identity and his newfound powers would take him across the United States, leading him into an ongoing feud with assorted adversaries including Vandal Savage, the Body Doubles and others, as well as alliances and friendship with various members of the Justice League (although he did not feel comfortable acting in a traditional superhero role). At least one alternate future has established Shelley's survival and long-term League membership into the 853rd Century. By then he had developed a device, the Resurrector, attached to his wrist, that could kill him in a way that allowed him to select specific powers (as opposed to the \\"Luck of the draw\\" system his normal deaths went by), in addition to always possessing super strength and flight comparable to Superman's. Vandal Savage was able to use this device against him, reprogramming the Resurrector to constantly kill Shelley, never giving him the chance to resurrect, until the Martian Manhunter destroyed the device. However, Shelley later returned alive in the subsequent DC One Million 80-Page Giant #1,000,000 (1999). Powers Shelley's main ability is a form of Immortality in that while he can die he can never stay dead, always reviving himself in short manner. Whenever Shelley is killed, he returns to life with a different power (or \\"gift\\" as he often refers to it) that correlates in some way to his death. These range from minor, almost dismissive abilities, such as the changing of his skin color, x-ray vision and making pyrotechnic butterflies, to the extraordinary, such as the ability to transform into a Hulk-like monster with a bullet-proof hide, Cosmic/Atomic Manipulation or quantum based telekinesis. He can potentially become more powerful than any other superhero on Earth if he \\"resurrects right\\". The source of his power appears to be nanites called \\"tektites\\" that permeate his body, although the Phantom Stranger claimed that Shelley had powers in previous lives. Shelley can resurrect whatever the state of his remains, including total cremation. Other versions=Elseworlds During the run of Resurrection Man, Abnett and Lanning also wrote an Elseworlds graphic novel called The Superman Monster which retold the story of Frankenstein as a Superman story. This featured an actual \\"resurrection man\\" (i.e. a body- snatcher) who was drawn to closely resemble Mitch Shelley.

He was granted the agnomen Isauricus for his victories over the Isaurian hill tribes. Upon returning to Rome he celebrated a triumph for his victories. Early career and supporter of Sulla Isauricus was the son of Gaius Servilius Vatia and a member of the plebeian branch of the gens Servilia, while his mother was Caecilia Metella, daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus.

He fought under Sulla in the First Battle of Clusium.Broughton, pg. 72 Later, in September of 82 BC, Vatia Isauricus was one of Metellus's lieutenants at the Second Battle of Clusium. Sulla won the war and became Dictator, in 79 BC, he appointed Vatia Isauricus as consul alongside Appius Claudius Pulcher.Broughton, pg. 82 While Isauricus was still consul designate, he opposed the awarding of a triumph to the young Pompey.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 14:4 Campaign against the pirates Location of Cilicia within the classical regions of Asia Minor/Anatolia After his consulship Vatia Isauricus was assigned the post of proconsular governor of Cilicia with the responsibility of clearing out the pirates which had been ravaging shipping for many years. His command lasted from 78 until 74 BC. The first year (78) he allocated to the military preparations, the following two years he fought a combined naval and land campaign against pirates and the Isauri in Cilicia.Broughton, pg. 87 In 77 and 76 he achieved a number of naval victories against the pirates off the Cilician coast, and was able to occupy the Lycian and Pamphylian coasts.Broughton, pg. 90 After the pirates fled to their fortified strongholds, Vatia Isauricus began attacking their coastal fortresses. He captured the town of Olympos, the stronghold of brigand Zenicetus. He then went on to capture Phaselis before subduing Corycus and a number of minor pirate strongholds, capturing a number of pirate captains in the process, including the famous Nicon.Smith, pg. 1233 In 75 BC he advanced across the Taurus Mountains, the first time a Roman army crossed these mountains, and succeeded in defeating the Isauri along the northern slopes. He laid siege to their principal town, Isaura, and managed to capture it after diverting the course of a river, thereby depriving the defenders in the town of their only source of water, after which they surrendered. It was during this part of the campaign that he was acclaimed Imperator by his legionaries.Broughton, pg. 99 By 74 BC, Vatia Isauricus had organized the territory he had conquered and incorporated it into the province of Cilicia. He was succeeded as proconsul of Cilicia by Lucius Octavius who died shortly after arriving. Octavius was succeeded by Lucius Licinius Lucullus who incorporated Vatia Isauricus' veteran troops and fleet into his army when he marched against Mithridates VI of Pontus at the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p.103. Upon his return to Rome, in 74 BC, he was granted a triumph, as well as being awarded the agnomen Isauricus for his victories in Isauria. After parading the captured pirates in his triumph, he deposited the entire war booty he had captured into the treasury and, unlike his peers, kept none for himself, a feat for which he was widely acclaimed.Liv. Epit. 90, 93; Oros. v. 23 ; Florus iii. 6 ; Eutrop. vi. 3 ; Strabo xiv. pp. 667, 671 ; Frontinus Stratagemata iii. 7. ¬ß 1; Cicero In Verrem i. 21, iii. 90, v. 26, 30, De lege agraria i. 2, ii. 19 ; Valerius Maximus viii. 5. ¬ß 6 ; comp. Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. iv. pp. 396, 397.) Later career By now, Vatia Isauricus was considered one of the leading members of the Senate, and sometime prior to 76 BC, Vatia Isauricus was admitted to the College of Pontiffs.Broughton, pgs. 114 & 333; Smith pg. 1233 In 70 BC he served as one of the judges in the trial of Gaius Verres. In 66 BC he supported the proposal of Gaius Manilius to give Pompey the command of the renewed war against the pirates. In 63 BC he was a candidate for the position of pontifex maximus, but was defeated by Julius Caesar, who had served him in his war against the pirates the decade before. Towards the end of that same year he had supported the consul Cicero in the suppression of the Catiline conspiracy, and spoke in the senate in favour of imposing the death penalty upon Catiline and his supporters. In 57 BC he joined the other members of the aristocracy to bring about Cicero‚Äôs return from banishment, while in the following year (56 BC) he opposed in the senate the restoration of Ptolemy XII Auletes, preferring instead to annex Egypt as a Roman province. In 55 BC he was elected censor, a position he held until at least July 54 BC. During his time as censor, he and his colleague attempted to regulate the stream of the Tiber River after a destructive flood in 54 BC.Broughton, pg. 215 From 55 to 44 BC Vatia Isauricus was the Princeps Senatus.Broughton, pg. 127 Due to his being close to 80 years of age, he took no part in the civil wars. He died in the early summer of 44 BC.Broughton, pg. 333 Vatia Isauricus was the father of the consul of 48 BC and 41 BC, Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. He also had a daughter named Servilia.
