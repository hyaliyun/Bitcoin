The film follows Las Vegas magician Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) as he attempts to reunite with his former partner Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) to take on dangerous street magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey). It also features Alan Arkin, Olivia Wilde, and James Gandolfini. The film began development in 2006, when New Line Cinema bought Kultgen's script, \\"Burt Dickenson: The Most Powerful Magician on Planet Earth\\". The development process gained momentum when Charles McDougall was hired as director in 2011, but he eventually left the project and was replaced with Scardino. Daley and Goldstein rewrote Kultgen's script which then saw further rewrites from Jason Reitman in June 2011. Filming was scheduled to begin in October 2011 in Los Angeles, California, but was pushed back to January 2012. On a $30 million budget, filming began on January 10, 2012 in Nevada with filming later moving to Los Angeles. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone was released on March 15, 2013, and earned over $27 million. Reviews generally praised Carrey's and Arkin's performances, but criticized the plot's inconsistent tone and predictability. Variety magazine listed The Incredible Burt Wonderstone as one of \\"Hollywood's biggest box office bombs of 2013\\" when it had made $27.4 million against a $30 million production cost. Plot In 1982, young Albert Weinselstein is harassed by bullies. His mother gives him a special magic trick set by veteran magician Rance Holloway as his birthday present. He studies the instructional video and begins to practice some tricks, attracting the attention of a classmate, Anthony Mertz. They practice together and eventually become professional magicians Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton, earning them success and an ongoing headlining act at the Bally's Hotel in Las Vegas. However, after ten years of performing the same tricks over and over again, Burt has become an overconfident, egocentric prima donna, and Anton begins to get fed up with Burt's ego, which has already cost them previous female assistants, all called \\"Nicole\\" in the act. In a rush, Burt enlists production assistant Jane as the new Nicole. Burt and Anton encounter up-and-coming street magician Steve Gray performing a unique yet disturbing card trick for his TV magic show, Brain Rapist. Audience numbers soon dwindle at Burt and Anton's show, upsetting Bally's owner Doug Munny. Taking a cue from Gray's endurance-based stunts, Anton suggests that he and Burt try a similar tack‚Äîlocking themselves in a Plexiglas cage called the \\"Hot Box\\" hung above ground. Overconfident, Burt does not prepare for the stunt and almost instantly falls into a panic, causing the stunt to fail and injuring Anton. Anton angrily ends his partnership with Burt, and Jane also quits. Burt refuses to change his act, staging his two-man show alone to disastrous results. Munny shuts down the production and Burt, having squandered his earnings over the years, is left broke. Despondent, Burt tries to find work and is eventually hired as an entertainer at an assisted-living facility catering to former Vegas entertainers. There he meets Holloway, who retired several years before because he found that he was no longer happy performing. Holloway counsels Burt about magic, inspiring him to remember the initial wonder that led him to become a magician. Burt is shocked to see Jane‚Äîherself an aspiring magician‚Äîworking for Gray. Appalled by Gray's style, Holloway and Burt polish their own tricks. Jane visits her grandmother at the facility and patches things up with Burt. Doug is opening a new casino-hotel and is offering a five-year contract to the winner of a talent search on the casino's opening night. He invites Burt to do a magic show at his son's birthday party, but Gray also appears and tries to upstage Burt with his own tricks. Disgusted by Gray's actions, Jane leaves his show. Burt reconnects with Anton, who has been distributing magic sets in Cambodia. A drug found in Cambodia called kratom that puts users into a deep sleep gives them an idea to perform a sensational trick that they were never able to perfect: the \\"Disappearing Audience\\". At the talent search show, Gray's performance involves him drilling into his brain, claiming it will not affect him. This, however, backfires, leaving Gray with brain damage. Holloway then introduces Burt, Anton, and Jane's performance before they secretly sedate the audience with kratom sleeping gas and then transport them to an outside location in the same seating arrangement. The audience awakes and responds with awe, and Doug awards the headlining act to Burt and Anton; they ask Jane to be their opening act. The trio then performs the Disappearing Audience trick again, returning everyone to the casino theater, as the now mentally-impaired Gray watches on with the drill bit still in his skull. As the film ends, the final scene shows how Burt, Anton, Holloway and others transported the audience to the open area, by unceremoniously dragging and transporting the unconscious audience members to the area, and hauling them back to the theater in a moving van. Cast * Steve Carell as Albert Weinselstein/Burt Wonderstone: :A formerly successful magician. The character's design is based partly on famous magicians Siegfried & Roy. Mason Cook, who was eleven years old in 2012, portrays Wonderstone as a child. Cook learned several magic tricks under a magic supervisor to portray Wonderstone as he begins to discover magic. * Steve Buscemi as Anthony Mertz/Anton Marvelton: :Wonderstone's former partner. Buscemi entered negotiations for a role on October 31, 2011. Luke Vanek, who was eleven years old in 2012, portrays Marvelton as a child. * Olivia Wilde as Jane: :Burt and Anton's assistant who dreams of becoming a magician. On October 27, 2011, it was reported that Wilde, Michelle Monaghan, Judy Greer, Sarah Silverman and Jessica Biel were in contention for the female lead. This list was reduced to Silverman, Wilde, and Greer, with all making strong impressions on the filmmakers but with Wilde as the front-runner. It was later reported that the filmmakers were waiting for Biel to audition before making their final decision. * Alan Arkin as Rance Holloway: :An elderly magician who inspired Burt to become a magician. Holloway was originally scripted to die, but the studio felt that audiences would have too much of a connection to the character and so he remained alive. * James Gandolfini as Doug Munny: :Billionaire owner of the Bally's Casino where Burt and Anton perform. Gandolfini was reported to be in talks for the role on October 29, 2011. In early December, Gandolfini traveled to Las Vegas to research his role, speaking with magicians Criss Angel and Nathan Burton, and The Mirage casino president Felix Rapaport and executive Kenny Epstein, and philanthropist Larry Ruvo. Speaking on their meeting, Rappaport stated that Gandolfini wanted to prepare for the role by \\"getting insights in Las Vegas, specifically in the entertainment world and the world of magic.\\" * Jim Carrey as Steve Gray: :A street-magician with a dangerous act. Carrey entered negotiations for a role in the film in October 2011. The character was described by Scardino as \\"if David Blaine and Criss Angel had a child\\", but that Carrey is \\"such an idiosyncratic performer, he's not quite either of those guys.\\" Carrey undertook a strict diet to lose weight and improve his physique for the role. The character was originally written as a low-key, bored villain who spoke so quietly that people would lean in to hear him, but after Carrey joined he wanted to take the character in a \\"Jesus-y\\" direction. Adam Pally was considered for the role. The cast also includes: Jay Mohr as magician Rick the Implausible; Michael Herbig as Lucius Belvedere, a magician with a German background and a thing for cats; Zachary Gordon as a bully from Wonderstone's youth; Brad Garrett as Dom, Burt's accountant; Gillian Jacobs as Miranda, a fan of magic who has a one-night stand with Wonderstone; and illusionist David Copperfield cameos as himself. The film's co-writer John Francis Daley cameos as a paramedic. Production =Development= The film started development in 2006 when New Line Cinema bought Chad Kultgen's script, titled \\"Burt Dickenson: The Most Powerful Magician on Planet Earth.\\" By September 2010, Carell had joined the film, and the script had been completely rewritten by screenwriting team John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. The pair extensively researched the lifestyle of Vegas magicians, taking note of the pressure of performing multiple times a day and the consequence of living within the \\"Vegas bubble where you're not exposed to the outside world [which] can actually make someone stir-crazy or egotistical.\\" In July 2011, the story was described as following Burt Wonderstone, a formerly successful magician who was overshadowed by a younger, edgier magician. However, by the time Carrey had joined the project in October 2011, the younger magician character had become simply a rival magician, and Burt was now part of a formerly successful magic duo. The script went through many changes during its years of development, with Daley and Goldstein alone writing approximately fifteen drafts over a three and a half year period. There were four different endings, four different final acts including one where Holloway is revealed as a betrayer. Discussing the script changes which saw the project enter production, producer Chris Bender said: \\"...it was tone, finding the right tone, because it was originally written more broadly where certain magic things were happening that wouldn‚Äôt actually be real magic and also, over time, the references that we were making in terms of the new school of magic and the old school of magic were becoming dated... Once [Carell] came on board, that‚Äôs when things really took off... And then finding the right director, too. These kind of comedies scare directors a lot because you‚Äôre taking a chance and you‚Äôre going for something bold comedy-wise that either could be a big hit or it could really miss.\\" Scenes of the young Wonderstone being inspired by a video of Rance Holloway, and buying a magic set were based on Daley's own childhood, in which he viewed a similar video of magician Mark Wilson. In February 2011, the film found a director in Charles McDougall, but by April 2011, McDougall had left the project with no reason being cited for the departure. In June 2011, 30 Rock director Don Scardino was confirmed to take the director chair. On June 16, 2011, Jason Reitman was brought aboard the project to perform additional rewrites to the Daley/Goldstein script. Reitman was reportedly paid for several weeks of work, but the extent of his involvement or the script changes was not detailed. Michael Schur, who produced and wrote for Carell on The Office, also provided a rewrite of the script. =Filming= Filming had been scheduled to begin in October 2011, in Los Angeles, California, but was pushed back to January 2012, with casting of the remaining lead roles occurring throughout October. Principal photography began on January 10, 2012, lasted approximately 47 days and had a $30 million budget. The film was shot on film stock instead of digital because it was decided that the difference in cost between the two was negligible, and the day shooting and color palettes of the magicians' outfits such as black and red were thought to be captured better on the stock. Among the locations used during the Las Vegas shooting are interiors and exteriors at the Bally's Las Vegas hotel and casino, and exteriors of the Las Vegas Strip, Downtown Las Vegas, Fremont Street, and Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel. Scardino, who had not filmed in Las Vegas since helming an episode of Tracey Takes On... approximately fifteen years earlier, described shooting on location in the city as \\"an absolute must\\". Scardino added \\"We just felt that, to give the movie authenticity, it had to be on the Strip\\". Carell was filmed on the Strip because Scardino believed his character is \\"a creature of the Strip,\\" while Carrey was filmed \\"in and around Fremont Street,\\" where his character felt more at home. Scardino explained the decision to film the characters in these environments, saying the \\"two different worlds\\" of Vegas \\"helps define our talent,\\" with the \\"ever-changing Strip\\" providing contrast with \\"the frozen- in-time aspect of Fremont Street.\\" By January 16, 2012, filming moved to Los Angeles and southern California, including the Wadsworth Theatre. Filming had concluded by March 13, 2012, after forty-nine days. When Scardino boarded the project, the script contained several magic tricks that could not realistically occur on stage such as lasers decapitating two individuals and the heads then switching bodies, which would have required the use of computer visual effects to accomplish. Scardino insisted that most of the magic tricks should be credible feats to make the magicians seem more believable, but some tricks still required the use of visual effects. David Copperfield served as a technical advisor on the film and developed a live stage illusion for the film's climax, featuring a body switch between Carell's and Buscemi's characters. Scardino insisted that the illusion should not depend on camera tricks, stating \\"I wanted one big stage illusion where you go, 'Oh, wow, how'd they do that?'\\" Copperfield provided instructions on how the trick worked and was present on set during its filming. The production also used other magic advisors who ensured that hand movements during tricks were correct, and also served as hand-doubles. Producer Chris Bender said that the film is meant to be set in a fictional history of the world of magic, and so the filmmakers avoided casting many real magicians, so that it would not seem that the film was intended to be set in reality. Release The Incredible Burt Wonderstone premiered as the opening film of the SXSW festival on March 8, 2013; it was introduced by Carell, Carrey and Wilde. The film received a wide release in North America and the United Kingdom on March 15, 2013. =Box office= The film earned $22.5 million in North America and $4.9 million elsewhere for a worldwide total of $27.4 million, against a budget of $30 million. In the week prior to its release in North America, the film was predicted to earn approximately $18 million and finish as the number 2 film of the weekend behind Oz the Great and Powerful. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone earned $3.72 million through its opening day including takings from midnight showings at 1,800 theaters. During its opening weekend the film earned $10.2 million from 3,160 theaters‚Äîan average of $3,221 per theater‚Äîranking third for the weekend behind new release The Call ($17.1 million) and holdover Oz the Great and Powerful ($41.3 million). The gross was one of the lowest openings for a Carell or Carrey film. In its second weekend, the film's takings dropped by 58% to $4.32 million, putting it in seventh place. =Critical reception= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 193 reviews, and an average rating of 5.16/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone serves up some goofy laughs, but given its outrageous conceit, it's surprisingly safe and predictable.\\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 44/100 based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \\"C+\\" on a scale of A+ to F. The film's plot was a focal point for criticism. Reviewers considered the tone uneven, segueing between dark comedy and family film, the extreme stunts of Carrey's Steve Gray, and sentimentality, and serious drama and farcical comedy. Several reviewers noted that the plot was predictable, and dated. Total Films Matthew Leyland said that the attention to detail in terms of magician gestures, posture and dialog created a \\"withering showbiz satire\\", which is sidelined in favor of sentimentality. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman said that the film is too cautious and unimaginative, choosing \\"earnest and mushy\\" over increasingly wild surprise, and Empires Helen O'Hara considered the script unfocused and the tone uneven, which undermined Carell's efforts to portray Wonderstone's return to glory, and The New York Times Stephen Holden said that the film's message was unoriginal and delivered without any special conviction. In contrast, Richard Roeper said that The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is \\"dark and wickedly funny\\", and Varietys Joe Leydon said that it neatly balanced sentimentality with edgy comedy. Times Mary Pols said that while the film does not always work, it did so enough that she thought it could be \\"the kind of semi-bad, semi-inspired comedy that could not only stand repeated viewings but perhaps improve with them.\\" Carrey's performance was generally praised for his humor and return to the physical style of comedy employed early in his career. Roeper said that Carrey is \\"physical, he's intense, he's ridiculous‚Äîand he made me laugh more than any comedic character in recent memory\\", and Alan Scherstuhl said that Carrey's \\"cartoon expressiveness\\" was used to its most judicious ends in years. Gleiberman said Carrey was one of the funniest components of the film, and Holden said that Carrey steals every scene he is in with a \\"take-no-prisoners ferocity that he hasn‚Äôt demonstrated in years\\". The Boston Globes Ty Burr however said that Carrey is good at being loud, but not funny. Arkin was also praised, with Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips saying that he \\"can't save the movie, but he can save his scenes.\\" Roeper labeled him a marvel, and Leydon called his performance scene-stealing. Leyland said that Carell's likability helped carry the sentimental segments, but Holden considered that his performance gave Wonderstone a soulfulness that undermined the film's farcical aspirations and left the character lacking \\"a shark's bite\\". Leydon said that Buscemi offered an engaging performance as the amiable Anton Marvelton, and Wilde was generally considered to have delivered a fine performance in an underwritten role. Pols said that the prospect of Wonderstone attracting Wilde's wholesome and intelligent Jane were absurd, but that Wilde's portrayal was game enough to remove the creepiness. Phillips and Los Angeles Timess Kenneth Turan criticized Scardino's direction, saying that the film offers slow and crude scenes over the fleet-footed material directed by Scardino on 30 Rock. Leydon conversely said that the director unobtrusively handled the gradual shifts in tone between black comedy and buddy comedy. =Accolades= The Incredible Burt Wonderstone received three nominations for the 2013 Teen Choice Awards: Choice Movie ‚Äì Comedy, Choice Movie Actor ‚Äì Comedy for Steve Carell, and Choice Movie Actress ‚Äì Comedy for Olivia Wilde.

Incest was a part of their family and heritage, so it was no surprise that she was carrying his child and the two were madly in love and due to be married, but the day before their wedding, an albino alligator dragged Caroline off into the swamp. Grimley sought out the gator in the hopes that he would find her alive, but instead he came across her being devoured in a corpse-filled, half-flooded mine tunnel. Going insane with rage, Grimley killed the gator with his bare hands, before eating its flesh, then consuming the flesh of his sister, along with every other piece of flesh in the cave, slowly devolving, becoming half-man, half-alligator himself. The others disbelieve the story, and they finally arrive at Grimley's house, unaware that they are being stalked by something in the swamp. They set up camp for the night near the Grimley house for an evening of drinking and having fun. Meanwhile, one of the shop patrons, Grover, is slaughtered by an unseen beast on the riverbank after ignoring warnings to not defy Grimley. Randy leaves the group to get more beer from the truck, returning just in time to interrupt Karen from taking advantage of a drunken Beth. Emily and Niles, having gone off on their own, admit their love and devotion to one another before making love, unaware that Oscar is secretly taking photos. Karen finds him, and masturbates him to climax as he continues to take photographs of the couple. When Oscar refuses to return the favor, however, she walks off and is knocked unconscious by Chopper, the owner of the store they'd come across. It is revealed that Oscar and Karen are both his children, and subservient to Lockjaw himself, he takes Karen away. Randy witnesses this and sees Lockjaw before running off into the woods. Oscar collapses on Emily and Niles, claiming that Randy had attacked him; Niles leaves Emily to treat Oscar's shock as he goes off in search of Randy. Randy and Niles both encounter Lockjaw and run, coming across a highway that they had supposedly gotten far off track from earlier; they return to look for Emily, only to be stopped by one of the shop workers who holds them at gunpoint. Niles is able to kill him, but Lockjaw gruesomely murders Randy. Afterward, Beth awakens from her drunken unconsciousness, her tent having been moved into a deep dark cave. As she emerges from it she discovers Lockjaw eating one of his victims and lets out a horrified scream, being presumably killed by him. Karen, having been set up as a sacrifice to Lockjaw, has her feet cut off by her father to lure Lockjaw from the underground, saying that it must be done for the family. After he leaves, Lockjaw emerges from the cavern below the shack and seems to recognize her by the necklace Chopper put around her neck, the same one that belonged to his sister. Niles finds Karen dead when he comes across the cabin, and is attacked by Oscar but quickly dispatches him with a machete. Afterwards, he sneaks into Lockjaw's cave to save Emily, when they emerge they manage a brief escape before she is taken by Chopper and his followers, with Lockjaw throwing Niles into the river to drown or become food to the gators. Chopper says to Emily that Lockjaw has chosen her to become his next bride. Niles, who is alive, follows the party to a gathering ritual that will allow Grimley to impregnate Emily. During the ceremony, Niles attacks, and after receiving a brutal beating from the overpowering Lockjaw, he manages to knock him into a sinkhole to drown. He unties Emily but, as Niles is reviving her, Lockjaw attacks again, pulling Emily into the hole, with Niles following. Later, at dawn, Emily and Niles (who is holding the jaw of Lockjaw) emerge from the sink hole alive. They manage to make their way back to their truck and ride off into the rising sun. Some time later, Chopper arrives at the refurbished Grimley cabin, which is hopping with family and friends in a huge celebration. It is revealed that Beth had survived her ordeals with Lockjaw and now has a baby, who Chopper seems sure is going to \\"grow up to be as strong as his daddy\\". It is shown that the baby's face is somewhat mutated and the screen goes dark.  Cast  * Mehcad Brooks as Niles, an ex‚ÄìNavy SEAL who left the forces to be with Emily. * Serinda Swan as Emily, Niles' girlfriend and a tough resilient girl in her own right. * Dillon Casey as Oscar, Chopper's son and Karen's brother, a jokester and sarcastic fun seeker. * Lauren Schneider as Karen, the tough and fun loving sister to Oscar and Chopper's daughter. * Amanda Fuller as Beth, a soft-spoken sweet and beautiful girl who is Randy's girlfriend, taken by Lockjaw. * Aaron Hill as Randy, Emily's brother, a resourceful but strict grunt soldier of the US Marines. * Pruitt Taylor Vince as Grover * Daniel Bernhardt as Grimley / Lockjaw, a man turned ravenous half- alligator beast who feeds on human flesh. * Sid Haig as Chopper, the leader of Lockjaw's cult and patriarch to his clan. * Jennifer Lynn Warren as Ophelia Production Creature was initially going to be a graphic novel named Lockjaw. Paul Mason, an executive producer, suggested to Andrews that it might be better done as a film. Andrews, who had worked as a production designer, agreed to direct. The film's incest themes were influenced by H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, in which rural, inbred cults worshiped inhuman creatures. More background on the creature was in the original script, but it did not make it into the film. The creature, which in the early stages was a serial killer in a slasher film, was eventually converted into more of a mutant. Release =Box office= Creature was released theatrically in the United States on September 9, 2011. The film grossed $327,000 from 1,507 venues on its opening weekend, making it the second lowest grossing first weekend ever for a film appearing on 1,500+ screens, and the third worst per location average ever. It ended its run with a domestic gross of $508,714. =Home media= The film was released on DVD on September 11, 2012 in the United States and Canada by Anderson Merchandisers, Lp and Phase 4 Films respectively. Reception Critical reception for the film has been overwhelmingly negative. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 10% of 29 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 2.86/10. Scott Foy of Dread Central panned the film awarding it a score of 1/5 stars and called it unworthy of wide release. Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times gave the film a negative review stating in his review on the film, \\"The six actors in the central, edible roles seem as if they could have pulled off a Scream-like satire, but since they weren‚Äôt asked to, there‚Äôs nothing much for them to do but follow the clearly visible paths to their doom. Not all are doomed, of course ‚Äî film tradition demands some survivors ‚Äî but the climactic scene, which seems to draw on mud wrestling for inspiration, is so silly that perhaps those who do make it through this swampy ordeal wish they hadn't\\". Corey Hall from Metro Times panned the film, concluding, \\"Creature is so laughably pathetic that it's worth a few chuckles, but the really amazing thing is that huckster Sid Sheinberg put up the cash to dump this slime- covered turd into more than 1,500 theaters nationwide, proving that hope, like evil swamp monsters, is eternal\\". Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"delightfully dopey\\" film that \\"has no illusions about what it is: a down-and-dirty, breasts-and-blood, creature-horror exploitation picture\\".

In the 1940s, Briceag was given a ten-year sentence in the gulag for distributing anti-communist flyers; he was forced to work in coal mines for the length of his sentence. His prisoner number was \\"P169\\". After his release, he was sentenced to seven more years of exile. He later became a symbol of resistance to Soviet occupation of Moldova. In 2004, Briceag won the Homo Homini Award of the Czech NGO People in Need, which recognizes \\"an individual who is deserving of significant recognition due to their promotion of human rights, democracy and non-violent solutions to political conflicts\\". The award citation described him as \\"a life-long activist for the defense of human rights and the defense of other former Gulag prisoners in Moldova\\". The following year, he served on the Rudolf Vrba Jury for People in Need's One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival, serving with fellow Homo Homini-winner Ales Bialacki. The same year, Briceag created controversy by opposing the re- installation of a statue of Vladimir Lenin in his hometown of BƒÉl≈£i. Briceag threatened to burn the statue down personally if it were completed. The Supreme Court of Moldova ultimately overruled the BƒÉl≈£i City Council's decision to allow the statue. Briceag also worked with Amnesty International and served as the BƒÉl≈£i coordinator of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. Briceag was noted for his large \\"Solzhenitsyn-style\\" beard. A few months before his death, he pledged to shave it if Moldova united with Romania, a move Moldova's communist party opposed. \\"A fi sau a nu fi acestei guvernari?\\" - aceasta-i intrebarea lui Voronin He publicly requested that his body be donated to Chi≈üinƒÉu's Nicolae Testemi≈£anu State University of Medicine and Pharmacy following his death.

Rice, beans, and tortillas are a staple of the Honduran diet, and some would argue there is little difference in quality between streetside vendor or a top restaurant. The city, like in most other places in Honduras, offers a wide variety of cuisine of taste from not only Honduras but also from Asia, India, the Middle East, and other countries. It offers food varieties from street food to gourmet food in five star restaurants with candlelit ambiance. However, according to Frommer's, the \\"Tegucigalpa's dining scene is considerably more varied when compared to the rest of the country, but lack the quality and depth of other Latin American cities.\\" Restaurants In recent years some notable Japanese, Italian and international restaurants have appeared in the city, marking it as different from the rest of the country with a fusion of styles. Of major note in this respect are the Japanese restaurants of Akai Kuroi which serves sushi, sashimi and teppanyaki, and Nobu which serves sushi, sashimi and fresh seafood, tempura, pad Thai, curries and soups. Gino's is the Italian restaurant of note, owned by the Honorary Consul General to Belize, and serves pastas, with sauces and rosemary and sea salt-scented focaccia, washed down with cappuccino. Restaurants of note serving international cuisine are Charlotte's Bistro, Porcao and the La Cumbre Restaurant which serves German (foods such as Jagerschnitzels and pork medallions) and international cuisine and the Fine London Pub which serves British and international cuisine (such as burgers, salads and seafood). Hamburgers are popular all across the city with burger restaurants such as BIGOS Hamburguesas Hondure√±as and global firms such as McDonald's. The most notable restaurant serving Honduran cuisine is El Patio, opened in the 1970s, which cooks grilled meat and chicken, kebabs of chicken, beef, shrimp, chorizo, and dishes such as anafre (bean and cheese fondue) and chuleta de cerdo (pork chops). However, most dishes are served with fries and onion rings. Don Quijote restaurant, with branches in La Leona and Valle de Angeles serves Spanish cuisine such as paellas and international fusion. An old fashioned and elegant restaurant, displaying a plaque reading \\"Here Lived Dr Policarpo Bonilla, President of the Republic from 1894 to 1899\\" is known for its continental and local cuisine and well stocked wines. Honduran cuisines (which is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous cuisine), particularly beef specialties, are served in the Epocas restaurant. Anafre, a delicacy of black beans with cheese fondue with vegetables, is a popular dish of the Restaurant El Anafre, in the central plaza area. There is also a notable Argentine restaurant in Tegucigalpa called Ni Fu Ni Fa which serves thick imported beef steaks and Argentine wine and a Cuban restaurant Sabor Cubano which serves Cuban dishes such as ropa vieja (flank steak in a tomato sauce), estofado de cerdo (braised garlic pork) and Cuban pastries and cocktails, being a notable venue for live music and dancing in the evenings.

The first SAGE III instrument was launched on the Russian Meteor (satellite) spacecraft. The recently revised SAGE III will be mounted to the International Space Station where it will use the unique vantage point of ISS to make long- term measurements of ozone, aerosols, water vapor, and other gases in Earth's atmosphere.  History of the SAGE legacy  The first SAGE instrument was launched February 18, 1979, to collect data on the various gases in the atmosphere, including ozone. The data collected on and the following instrument , which began taking measurements in , were critical to the discovery of the Earth's ozone hole and the creation of 1987 Montreal Protocol, which banned ozone-depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). SAGE III on ISS is a nearly exact replica of Meteor-3M, sent into orbit in 2001 on a Russian satellite. Meteor-3M went out of service in March 2006 when the satellite's power supply stopped working. The new instrument was built in anticipation of being attached to the space station in 2005. A change in ISS design, however, put those plans on hold. The instrument was stored in a Class 100 clean room in a sealed shipping container under a continuous gaseous nitrogen purge. The purge kept clean dry \\"air\\" inside the instrument. Recently, the opportunity arose for to be placed on ISS, and build on the long record of stratospheric gas data that its ancestors created. The week of February 14, 2011, scientists at NASA Langley Research Center pulled the instrument from storage to begin initial testing and calibrations in preparation prepping it for launch. SAGE III-ISS preparing for its scan of the moon February 17, 2011. The SAGE team arrived at midnight to continue testing the instrument, which will be attached to the space station to measure ozone, water vapor and aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere.  Science behind SAGE III on ISS  The 76-kilogram (168 lb) instrument is a grating spectrometer that measures ultraviolet and visible energy. It relies upon the flight-proven designs used in the Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement () and first and second SAGE instruments. The design incorporates charge-coupled device (CCD) array detectors and a 16 bit A/D converter. Combined, these devices allow for wavelength calibration, a self-consistent determination of the viewing geometry, lunar occultation measurements, and expanded wavelength coverage. The SAGE III sensor assembly consists of pointing and imaging subsystems and a UV/visible spectrometer. The pointing and imaging systems are employed to acquire light from either the Sun or Moon by vertically scanning across the object. The spectrometer uses an 800 element CCD linear array to provide continuous spectral coverage between 290 and 1030 nm. Additional aerosol information is provided by a discrete photodiode at 1550 nm. This configuration enables to make multiple measurements of absorption features of target gaseous species and multi-wavelength measurements of broadband extinction by aerosols.  Atmospheric components studied by SAGE III on ISS  SAGE III Instrument The SAGE III mission is an important part of NASA's Earth Observation System and is designed to fulfill the primary scientific objective of obtaining high quality, global measurements of key components of atmospheric composition and their long-term variability. The primary focus of on ISS will be to study aerosols, clouds, water vapor, pressure and temperature, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, and chlorine dioxide. = Aerosols = Aerosols play an essential role in the radiative and chemical processes that govern the Earth's climate. Since stratospheric aerosol loading has varied by a factor of 30 since 1979, long-term monitoring of tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols is crucial. aerosol measurements will provide important contributions in the area of aerosol research. = Clouds = Clouds play a major role in determining the planet's solar and longwave energy balance and, thus, are important in governing the Earth's climate. will provide measurements of mid and high level clouds including thin or \\"sub- visual\\" clouds that are not detectable by nadir-viewing passive remote sensors. These observations are important because while low clouds primarily reflect incoming solar radiation back into space (acting to cool the planet), mid and high level clouds enhance the \\"greenhouse effect\\" by trapping infrared radiation (acting to warm the planet). Also, the presence of thin cloud near the tropopause may play a significant role in heterogeneous chemical processes that lead to ozone destruction in mid-latitudes. = Water vapor = Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas and plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate system. An improved understanding of the global water vapor distribution can enhance our ability to understand water's role in climate processes. water vapor measurements will provide important contributions on the long-term effect of this green house gas. = Ozone = From September 21 to 30, 2006, the average area of the ozone hole was the largest ever observed, at 10.6 million square miles (27.5 million square kilometres). This image, from September 24, the Antarctic ozone hole was equal to the record single-day largest area of 11.4 million square miles (29.5 million square kilometres), reached on Sept. 9, 2000. The blue and purple colors are where there is the least ozone, and the greens, yellows, and reds are where there is more ozone. Ozone research has remained at the forefront of atmospheric science for many years because stratospheric ozone shields the Earth's surface (and its inhabitants) from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Since recent declines in stratospheric ozone have been linked to human activity, accurate long-term measurements of ozone remain crucial. It is important to monitor ozone levels in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere since observed trends are the largest and most poorly understood at those altitudes. SAGE III's high vertical resolution and long-term stability make it uniquely well suited to make these measurements. will also be able to look at the relationship between aerosol, cloud, and chemical processes affecting ozone argue for simultaneous measurements of these atmospheric constituents (such as those made by ). = Pressure and temperature = SAGE III temperature measurements will provide a unique data set for monitoring and understanding atmospheric temperature changes. In particular, the long-term stability and self-calibration capabilities of may permit the detection of trends in stratospheric and mesospheric temperature that will be important diagnostics of climate change. temperature measurements in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere will be a new source of long-term temperature measurements in this region of the atmosphere to complement existing long-term measurements made by satellites (MLS, ACE, SABER) and ground based lidar systems. temperature measurements will also allow the monitoring of periodic temperature changes, such as those associated with the solar cycle and quasi-biennial oscillation, and the effects of radiative forcing by aerosols. = Nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, and chlorine dioxide = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen trioxide (NO3), and chlorine dioxide (OClO) play crucial roles in stratospheric chemistry and the catalytic cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. NO2 measurements are important because the processes that occur in the Antarctic winter and spring and give rise to the ozone hole effectively convert NO2 to nitric acid (HNO3). Thus NO2 is an important diagnostic of ozone hole chemistry. Since it is measured during both solar and lunar occultation events, observations of NO2 will improve our understanding of the strong diurnal (daily) cycles in stratospheric processes. In addition, will make virtually unique measurements of nitrogen trioxide (NO3). Although it is short-lived in the presence of sunlight, NO3 plays an active role in the chemistry of other reactive nitrogen species such as NO2 and di-nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and, thus, indirectly in ozone chemistry. Since few other measurements of NO3 are available, measurements, which are made during lunar occultation (nighttime) events, will provide crucial validation for our current understanding of reactive nitrogen chemistry.  Launch  Artist rendering of SpaceX Dragon spacecraft delivering cargo to the International Space Station SAGE III was launched on the SpaceX CRS-10 mission using a Falcon 9 with Dragon. traveled in the unpressurized trunk of Dragon, which launched on February 19, 2017.

It is an ancient temple dedicated to the worship of Lord Shiva and Shakti and is considered one of the oldest Hindu temples in India. It is also considered as the oldest functional Hindu temple of India. The information plaque erected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at the site indicates the dating of the temple to 625 CE. Hindu inscriptions dated 635 CE were found in the temple. The temple is a protected monument under ASI since 1915. Local folklores say that Chanda and Munda who were full brothers and chieftains of great demon Mahishasura were rulers of the area. Mahishasura fought decisive battle with Gooddess Durga as mentioned in Durga Shaptshati. Munda made goddess Mundeshwari Bhawani temple while his younger brother Chanda made Chandeshwari temple at top of Madurana hill near Chainpur. But historical facts better explain its origin and its creators. After a study of broken Mundeshwari inscription of Brahmi script and its two parts found in 1891 and 1903 by Bloch (Now joined and kept in National Museum, Kolkata), Dr NG Majumdar and Dr KC Panigrahi stated to be the temple to be earlier than 4th century AD. But recovery of a royal seal of great Shri Lankan emperor Maharaju Dutthagamani (101-77BC) from the place in 2003, changed the history. It established that a royal pilgrims group or monks from Shri Lanka visited the place during their journey to Sarnath from Bodh Gaya through famous Dakshinapath highway sometime between 101BC to 77BC and lost the seal here. The existence of Naga (serpent) on four faced shivalingam, Naga janeu (sacred thread) on Ganesha idols not found anywhere in India and also on broken pieces scattered around the hill clearly indicated that it was a construction by rulers of Naga dynasty (110BC to 315AD) who used serpent as their royal sign. Mahabharata mentioned that Guru Dronacharya has been made the ruler of Ahikshatra (region of serpents) spead over Ahinaura, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra and Kaimur region of present times, as a fee for educating Kaurava and Pandavas. Udaysena, the ruler mentioned in the inscription had similarity with Naga dynasty rulers Nagsen, Veersen etc. The existence of 52 Pur (villages) of Nagvanshi Rajpoots also indicate about their long control over the area. Later the area came control of Gupta dynasty and the impact of their specific Nagra style of architecture and Ramgarh Fort and Ramgarh village near the hill probable on famous Gupta ruler Ramgupta are evidence of the fact. After revelation of new facts, Bihar State Religious Trust Board (BSRTB) organized a national seminar of eminent experts at Patna in 2008 and the date of Mundeshwari inscription was unanimously fixed 108 AD. The findings also established that here was a religious and educational center spread over the hillock and Mandaleshwar (Shiva) temple (present temple residing Shiva in middle of sanctum sanctorium) was the main shrine. The temple of Mandaleshwari (Parvati, better half of Shiva) was on southern side. The temple was damaged and the idol of Mandaleshwari (degenerated Mundeshwari and later connected with the mythical demon Mund) was kept in the eastern chamber of main temple.  Historical events  * 636-38AD - Chinese visitor Huen Tsang writes about a shrine on a hill top flashing light, at about a distance of 200 lee south west to Patna- The location is only of Mundeshwari. * 1790 AD - Daniel brothers Thomas and William visited Mundeshwari temple and provided its first portrait. * 1888 AD ‚Äì Buchanan visited the region in 1813.. * 1891-92 AD ‚Äì First part of the broken Mundeshwari Inscription was discovered by Bloch during a survey by East India Company. * 1903 AD ‚Äì Second part of the inscription was discovered while clearing the debris around the temple. * 2003 AD ‚Äì Brahmi script royal seal of great Shri Lankan emperor Maharaju Dutthagamani (101-77BC) was discovered by Varanasi based historian Jahnawi Shakhar Roy which changed the earlier findings about history of the place. * 2008 AD - The date of the inscription was established 30th year of Saka era (108AD) by the scholars in a national seminar organized for the purpose by Bihar State Religious Trust Board (BSRTB) at Patna. The temple was declared oldest Hindu temple of the country by the scholars with 2000 years of live worship having its past in pre historic age Geography The Mundeshwari Devi temple is located on the Mundeshwari Hill at an elevation of . Located on Kaimur plateau near Son River,(and Survuwara(suvara) river) there are many archaeological relics on the Mundeshwari Hill. How to reach It can be reached by road via Patna, Gaya, or Varanasi. The nearest railway station is at Mohania - Bhabua Road railway station from where the temple is 22 km by road. Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport, Varanasi is the nearest airport, located at a distance of 102 km from the Temple. Indian carriers including Air India, Spicejet, and international carriers like Air India, Thai Airways International, Korean Air and Naaz Airlines operate from here. Daily flights to Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata are available from here. Architecture The temple, built of stone, is on an octagonal plan which is rare. It is the earliest specimen of the Nagara style of temple architecture in Bihar. There are doors or windows on four sides and small niches for the reception of statues in the remaining four walls. The temple shikhara or tower has been destroyed. However, a roof has been built, as part of renovation work. The interior walls have niches and bold mouldings which are carved with vase and foliage designs. At the entrance to the temple, the door jambs are seen with carved images of Dvarapalas, Ganga, Yamuna and many other murtis. The main deities in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple are of the Devi Mundeshwari and Chaturmukh (four faced) Shiva linga. There are also two stone vessels of unusual design. Even though the Shiva linga is installed in the centre of the sanctum, the main presiding deity is Devi Mundeshwari deified inside a niche, which is seen with ten hands holding symbols riding a buffalo, attributed to Mahishasuramardini. The temple also has murtis of other popular gods such as Ganesha, Surya and Vishnu. A substantial part of this stone structure has been damaged, and many stone fragments are seen strewn around the temple. However, under the jurisdiction of ASI, it has been the subject of archaeological study for quite some time. Worship The plate at the site of the Temple gives a dates of 625 CE for the Temple. Hindu inscriptions dated 635 CE were found in the temple. It is believed that rituals and worship have been performed here without a break, hence Mundeshwari is considered one of the most ancient Hindu temples in India. The temple is visited by a large number of pilgrims each year, particularly during the Ramnavami, Shivratri festivals. A big annual fair (mela) is held nearby during the Navaratra visited by thousands. The worship of shakti in the form of Devi Mundeshwari in the temple is also indicative of tantric cult of worship, which is practiced in Eastern India. Renovation and restoration The Archaeological Survey of India has restored the temple under instruction from the Union Ministry of Culture. Restorative works included the removal of soot from the temple interior via a chemical treatment, repair of damage to religious murti (idol) and cataloging and documentation of scattered fragments for later reuse. Other works included installation of solar powered lighting, displays for antiquities and provision of public amenities. The Government of Bihar has allocated Rs 2 crore to improve access to the temple.

Stephens in 2011.UnCollege: Home-Schooling For College Students Huffington Post, 02/10/11Students develop new UnCollege curriculum The Dartmouth Monday, February 28, 2011 Background Stephens is a self-described \\"elementary school dropout\\", as he was homeschooled with emphasis on real-world experience for the majority of his childhood.Gobry, Pascal-Emmanuel (2011-06-14). Peter Thiel Is Giving This Man $100,000 To Disrupt College. Business Insider, 14 June 2011. He briefly attended Hendrix College. While there, Stephens had a night-long discussion with a friend regarding the disconnect between the theoretical subject matter taught in college and its real world applications. This discussion would become the basis for UnCollege, which Stephens founded in 2010. In 2010, Stephens also applied for the Thiel Fellowship, a program founded by Peter Thiel which grants fellows US$100,000 to forgo college for two years and focus on their passions. After his initial proposal was rejected, Stephens was encouraged to reapply in pursuit of his work as an educational futurist through UnCollege. His second application succeeded and he was in the first batch of Thiel Fellows. Description UnCollege provides resources for students who wish to define their own educational paths, whether in or outside of traditional higher education models. The site is inspired by Stephens' background in unschooling and his frustrations with the college experience. He states that his goal with UnCollege is not to take down universities, but to encourage more people to consider the opportunity cost of attending college. UnCollege features resources, forums, and workshops designed to help students, both in and out of college, gain useful skills. The site also hosts the UnCollege Manifesto, a 25-page document written by Stephens that covers subjects like \\"The value (or lack thereof) of a college degree\\" and \\"Twelve steps to self-directed learning.\\"The UnCollege Manifesto. UnCollege. Additionally, the site matches students with mentors, and encourages students to collaborate and learn outside of the classroom. Concept The UnCollege movement is founded on these principles: * Many people pay too much for university and learn too little. * You can get an amazing education anywhere‚Äîbut you‚Äôll have to stop writing papers and start doing things. * You need an excellent education to survive in a world where 50% of the population is under 30. * Subjects taught in traditional universities are often contrived, theoretical, and irrelevant, promoting conformity and regurgitation rather than innovation and learning. * You don‚Äôt have to decide what to do with your life at age 18. * You can contribute to society without a university degree. * You cannot rely on university to give you a complete and relevant education when professors are often more interested in researching than teaching. * If you want to gain the skills requisite for success, you must hack your education.UnCollege About. Retrieved from http://uncollege.org/about. The UnCollege movement believes that college, while not itself adverse, needs significant changes because: * Tuition is rising at twice the rate of inflation. * Students are not learning. * Students are incurring high levels of debt to finance their educations.

It took place during the great Papal schism and the Hundred Years' War between England and France. While France supported Clement, whose court was based in Avignon, the English supported Pope Urban VI in Rome. Popular at the time among the lower and middle classes, Despenser's Crusade \\"was only widely criticised in hindsight\\",Christopher Tyerman, England and the Crusades, 1095‚Äì1588 (University of Chicago Press, 1988), 262. and \\"for all its canonical propriety, [it] was the Hundred Years' War thinly disguised\\".Tyerman, England, 336. Among contemporary critics of the crusade were John Wyclif and the French chronicler Jean Froissart, who charged its leaders with hypocrisy. Background =Flemish revolt= The County of Flanders, in which Ghent lay, was an ally of France (part of its territory was in France and part in the Holy Roman Empire). A revolt first broke out in Flanders in September 1379, and the English parliament of 1380, the last to convene at Northampton, recorded that no wool subsidy had been received because of the \\"present riot\\" in Flanders. Wool was a major English export to the Flemish looms, and between the fiscal years of 1381‚Äì82 and 1382‚Äì83 total exports dropped from 18,000 to 11,000 sacks.Margaret Aston, \\"The Impeachment of Bishop Despenser\\", Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research 38 (1965): 134 and n. 5, citing F. Miller, \\"The Middleburgh Staple, 1383‚Äì88\\", Cambridge Historical Journal 2 (1926): 65. In 1382‚Äì83, only 2,192 sacks passed through the main English staple port of Calais, leading to the rise of Middelburg in competition.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 135. When the citizens of Ghent rebelled against the count, Louis de Male, in January 1382, they requested English assistance. Louis attempted to block English imports. Under the leadership of Philip van Artevelde the Flemings expelled Louis from Flanders at the Battle of Beverhoutsveld and took Bruges. Louis soon procured a French army to relieve him, and the militia of Ghent was decisively defeated at the Battle of Roosebeke on 27 November, where Philip was killed. The city was forced to accept Louis's terms, to acknowledge Clement as the legitimate pope and to aid in the fight against the English. The fleet of Ghent escaped to England, where it kept up the war,Carol Miller, \\"Despenser's Crusade (1382‚Äì83)\\", Historical Dictionary of Late Medieval England, 1272‚Äì1485, ed. Ronald H. Fritze and William Baxter Robison (Greenwood Press, 2002), 155‚Äì56. while the rebel commander Frans Ackerman sought to negotiate English support for their cause.J.-J. De Smet, \\"Ackerman (Fran√ßois)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 1 (Brussels, 1866), 14‚Äì18. Charles VI of France entered Bruges and confiscated all the English merchants' goods. Coat-of-arms of John of Gaunt, demonstrating his claim to rule Castile and Le√≥n. He championed a crusade to Spain in opposition to Despenser's crusade. =Parliamentary debate= In October 1383, Parliament convened to debate the financing of a crusade. One side, led by John of Gaunt, put forward a crusade to establish him on the throne of Castile, and gained the support of the upper chamber‚Äîthe later House of Lords. The other side, led by the Courtenays, the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Buckingham, argued for a campaign to relieve Ghent and was supported by the lower chamber‚Äîthe later House of Commons. These were \\"two noble ways\\" (deux noble chymyns) to aid the king's friends (the Flemish communes, and the Portuguese in the mist of a succession crisis) against his enemies.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 132‚Äì33. The former option, the \\"way of Portugal\\" (chemin de Portyngale), was a pet project of John of Gaunt's. He had formally claimed the throne of Castile since at least 30 January 1372, when he received royal permission to include the arms of Castile and Le√≥n on his own coat-of-arms. Edmund of Langley, the king's brother, led a disastrous military campaign in Portugal in favour of John's claim in 1379. In January or February 1380, Ferdinand I of Portugal declared for Clement, but then on 29 August 1381 he went over to Urban's camp. Then, in March 1382, Urban issued the bull Regimini sacrosancte, condemning the Castilian king, Henry II, as a schismatic. During the parliamentary debate, John Gilbert, Bishop of Hereford, pointed out that while France remained within the Catholic fold, formally, Despenser's crusade would have to be a general effort against the Clementists, while John of Gaunt's could proceed against the excommunicated King of Castile specifically. The latter option, the \\"way of Flanders\\", was cheaper and of more immediate military value, for it could relieve the pressure on the English-held port of Calais. Parliament approved funding and appointed Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich, as leader of the crusade, although it appears the crusade was initially to be led by John of Gaunt or another of the king's uncles.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 128: \\"[I]t was agreed in the last parliament that my lord of Spain, or another of the king's uncles should voyage towards France for the honour of the realm.\\" The term \\"lord of Spain\\" referred to John, who had a claim on Castile. The bishop refused to accept Arundel as his lieutenant and secular leader of the expedition.Tyerman, England, 334. Some peers criticised the crusade as threatening Richard II's claim on France, citing the way in which Urban VI had tried to control Naples after its successful defence against the Clementist Louis of Anjou's expedition in 1381.Tyerman, England, 338. Planning and organisation =Papal and ecclesiastical= As early as 1378, the Cardinal Pietro Pileo di Prata expressed hope that through Richard II's marriage to Anne of Bohemia, an anti-French alliance between England and the Holy Roman Empire could be forged. The Bohemians, however, refused to go to war with France unless the nation was excommunicated, a measure Urban found too extreme.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 133‚Äì34. In 1379 Despenser published the bull Nuper cum vinea (6 November 1378) of Urban VI offering plenary indulgences to both the living and the dead in return for contributions proportional to or consistent with the donor's wealth to the general crusade against the Clementists. (Women generally gave jewellery and household effects.) In March 1381, by two bulls, Urban appointed Despenser in charge of the anti-Clementist crusade in England, and gave him the power to grant indulgences and to dispense priests to participate. This was probably a result of the diplomatic work of his clerk, Henry Bowet, who had gone to Rome on royal business in February 1380. The two bulls he delivered to Despenser, Dudum cum vinea Dei (23 March) and Dudum cumjilii Belial (25 March), survive in several copies. A further bull, Dignum censemus, of 15 May empowered Despenser to preach the crusade in both archdioceses of England, Canterbury and York, and to take action against opponents of his message. These three bulls reached England in August 1381, and copies were distributed to the English episcopate on 17 September. Despenser \\"at once\\", according to Ranulf Higdon's Polychronicon, sent out his collectors to receive donations in return for the granting of indulgences. They were wildly successful, especially among commoners, perhaps because of the economic benefit of restoring order to Flanders, with which England had extensive trade. On 21 December 1382, in Saint Paul's Cathedral, London, the bishop of Norwich took the cross and formally vowed to go on the crusade. While the crusade was preached by friars, false confessors went about extorting money while some legitimate priests refused to hand over their collections to the war chest. The corruption inspired a series of denunciations from the reformer John Wyclif. Despenser, however, promised that the crusade would only attack the supporters of the \\"schismatic\\" antipope, and: > if within the year it should happen that the realm of France was converted > to the faith of the true Pope Urban, the bishop should be bound to fold up > and put away the banner of the crusade, and thenceforth to serve our lord > the king under his [the king‚Äôs] own colours [in some other theatre].Aston, > \\"Impeachment\\", 131. =Royal and parliamentary= The Exchequer saw to the procurement of bows and arrows. The public finances were overseen by Despenser's treasurer, Robert Foulmere, and by a London merchant, Sir John Philpot, who also acted as the expedition's banker. With his private money he funded some recruits and their transport across the Channel. The ceremony whereat Despenser took the cross were characterised by the standard pageantry, \\"the cross and the crusade banner, and the sermons, masses, processions, and confessions\\". Despenser appointed as captains of the crusade Hugh Calveley, William Elmham, Thomas Tryvet, John Ferris, Hugh Despenser, William Ferinton and Matthew Reedman. The crusade attracted a large number of recruits, but it also attracted undesirable (and uninvited, according to the Westminster Chronicle) volunteers: bored monks with no fighting ability, youthful apprentices of the London guilds and outright criminals. The crusaders who had taken the proper vows wore red crosses, which symbol was already being transformed into the English national banner.Tyerman, England, 327.Tyerman, God's War: A New History of the Crusades (London: Penguin Books, 2006), 909. At the last moment, according to the historian Thomas of Walsingham, there was an effort to prevent the crusade's departure. King Richard II, who was advocating peace with France, ordered Despenser to await the arrival of William de Beauchamp, an experienced general, but the bishop ignored him. Campaign The crusade was mustered at Sandwich on 27 April, and sailed for Calais on 16 May 1383. The chronology of the crusade from the sailing until 25 May is provided in a letter Despenser wrote to another prelate.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 127 n. 2. The first crusaders to arrive at Calais stayed only a few days, before the entire force had crossed the channel. The bishop led them in a successful attack on Gravelines.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 128‚Äì29. That month (May 1383), on the home front, one Thomas Depham of Norfolk was imprisoned for casting doubt on an official report from Flanders.Tyerman, England, 339. =Siege of Ypres= Ypres during the Bishop of Norwich's siege. The illustration, a reproduction of an engraving published in 1610, shows the siege in progress. The crusade joined the militia of Ghent in June. There was some debate over whether to attack Bruges or Ypres in Flanders, or to invade France, \\"the worst schimastic\\", as one historian puts it. The army decided to besiege Ypres, which was in fact an Urbanist city. Walsingham nevertheless describes the crusaders using typical but entirely misplaced rhetoric: > Having the banner of the Holy Cross before them [they] thought that victory > in this cause was glory but death reward. . . [T]hose who suffered death > would be martyrs ... and thus the blessing of the cross was achieved, and > the crucesignati [cross-signed] gloriously captured the town and there > destroyed the enemies of the cross so that not one of them remained alive. At Ypres the problem of the unpaid \\"volunteers\\" was exacerbated under siege conditions. In June Despenser ordered \\"all who are not in receipt of official wages\\" to return to England. These undisciplined elements had only joined the host for the opportunity of plunder, according to Walsingham. From Flanders, some of the captains wrote to the king that the campaign was falling apart \\"for lack of a lieutenant and of the good government of [the bishop].\\"Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 129: pur defaute de Lieutenant et bon governement d'icelle. According to the transcript of the bishop's later trial, the king negotiated for Arundel to gather a group of men-at-arms and archers and go to Flanders, but the \\"ambiguously written\\" letters of Despenser, and reports of speeches he had made, indicated that he would not accept a lieutenant. When a French relieving force approached the town, Despenser decided to abandon the siege on 8 August, after eight weeks of effort. Calveley suggested turning towards Clementist France, but the leadership of the crusade then split. Despenser, who claimed at his trial to have supported an attack on France only to be opposed by the majority of his captains, took his forces to Gravelines, while the remaining captains were bribed to surrender the land they had conquered and go home. =Truce= After burning Gravelines, which he had wanted to hold, Despenser made a deal with the French and sailed his army home by September. He later claimed that the restlessness of the 6,000‚Äì7,000 evacuees from the other surrendered towns and his lack of provisions, with the truce set to expire in a few days, forced his hand. He had in fact received royal permission to evacuate if he was short of victuals.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 130. At the time of the truce, the king: > had appointed his uncle of Spain [John of Gaunt] to come quickly to > [Despenser's] aid and support. And none the less, [Despenser] departed from > there, leaving the same town to the enemy, contrary to the form of [his] > indenture. The truce, so it was alleged by Despenser's opponents, was due \\"to the coming of our lord the king and my lord of Lancaster [John of Gaunt], who was by the sea, ready to cross\\" at the time. Aftermath Upon returning, Despenser and his captains were summoned by the chancellor, Michael de la Pole, at the insistence of parliament, which opened on 26 October. =Impeachment of Despenser= At the end of the proceedings, which took place before king and parliament, the bishop was impeached, deprived of his temporalities for two years, on the basis \\"of several matters, but especially of four articles\\". These four articles were the main allegations put against him by De la Pole. The first two alleged that although he was pledged \\"to serve the king in his wars of France\\" with 2,500 men-at-arms and an equal number of archers mustered at Calais for the period of a year, his force did not meet that quota, there was no muster of the whole at Calais and the force had returned and been disbanded after less than six months. The other two articles accused Despenser of refusing to abide by the condition that he take with him \\"the best and most sufficient captains of the realm, after royalties\\"‚Äîa condition he got around by refusing to name his captains until after permission for his expedition was already granted, and by deceiving the king through \\"beaux promesses\\" in order to retain complete control of military matters (and avoiding taking Arundel with him). Despenser defended himself by claiming that the siege of Ypres was advised by the men of Ghent, that losses to both his own forces and those of Ghent (an \\"act of God\\", aventure de Dieux) had forced his lifting the siege, and the truce with the French might be preliminary to a lasting peace. He further claimed that he had more than quota of forces at Ypres, even though they had not all assembled at Calais; and that although Lord Neville had offered to go in the king's very presence Richard had refused permission. He admitted to having received in Flanders royal letters asking him to accept a lieutenant, to which he claimed to have replied asking king and council to appoint one. After being found guilty, Despenser asked the king for a hearing before parliament to present his defence without interruption, which was granted for 24 November. In his final defence, the bishop attempted to place some blame on his captains, but Michael de la Pole was given another opportunity to rebut him. His guilt was confirmed, and although he had acted \\"contrary to the common custom of the estate of [a] prelate of England\\",Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 130‚Äì32, shows that this charge was hypocritical for the times. In 1346 William Zouche, Archbishop of York, had commanded English forces at the Battle of Neville's Cross, and in 1372 Thomas Hatfield, Bishop of Durham, had offered to lead troops as a sort of condottiere for Pope Gregory XI. Cf. J. R. L. Highfield, \\"The English Hierarchy in the Reign of Edward III\\", Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 5th series, 6 (1956): 135. Richard II offered to treat him as an ecclesiastic. His temporalities were suspended and he was fined for the entire public cost of the expedition, to be paid for out of the francs he had received in France. =Punishment of the captains= The captains of the crusade were asked to answer allegations of receiving bribes totalling 18,000 gold francs. The leaders did not deny the allegations, but argued that because they had been forced to leave behind valuable horses the money was compensation. The treasurer, Foulmere, and five of the captains (notably, not Calveley) were imprisoned and fined 14,600 gold francs. On 9 January 1384, the Exchequer recorded the receipt of ¬£287 9s. 4d. of money captured during the Flemish expedition, paid by one Henry Bowet on Foulmere's behalf, and the further receipt of ¬£770 16s. 8d. for 5,000 francs \\"illicitly received\\" overseas.Aston, \\"Impeachment\\", 128 n. 1.

It is located at 93 Highland Avenue in the Rosedale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The property overlooks the Park Drive Reservation Ravine formed by Yellow Creek and goes from Highland Avenue halfway down to the floor of the ravine. The house was built between 1908 and 1910 by Toronto architects Wickson and Gregg. It was the home of gold-mining magnate David Dunlap and his philanthropist wife, Jessie (who donated the David Dunlap Observatory to the University of Toronto in 1935 in honour of her late husband). After Mrs. Dunlap's death in 1946, the house went through one owner before being purchased in 1956 by U of T as a suitable residence for its president. Gardens and natural history The upper lawn is bounded by mature Quercus and Acer saccharum on the north with a single mature specimen of Acer saccharinum and Ailanthus altissima next to the thirty two room estate house and a Robinia pseudoacacia on the eastern edge of the half acre lawn. A steep grassed slope flows south to the second terrace where the greenhouses, sheds and cold frames are located on the west side and a large gazebo situated beneath two large Salix babylonica which have since, blown down in a windstorm in the early 2000s. Beneath a stone step lies the remains of a family pet whose name (Billy, 1947) is inscribed upon the stone. From here the second slope; peppered with Syringa vulgaris and stumps of trees and shrubs long gone, flows onto the third terrace where several varieties of Malus grow, along with Euonymus europaeus, Sorbus aucuparea and Robinia pseudoacacia. The greenhouses and grounds had been abandoned for six months except for some grass cutting by the University of Toronto Grounds Department in 1981, as the Estate Gardener had died that spring. It took the next Estate Gardener two weeks to get the two growing greenhouses and sheds up to working condition, and it wasn't until September that the plants in the conservatory were transplanted, divided, cleaned and rejuvenated. After the fall season, it was discovered that the lower of three tiers was in reality a half acre terraced rock garden with two large concrete ponds and a 300-foot artificial stream running to it from the east side of the upper lawn. The forest is composed primarily of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus rubra, Betula papirifera, Acer rubrum, A. saccharum, Ostria and Robinia pseudoacacia. The half acre rock garden encompasses the entire lower western section of the estate covering three smaller slopes and two smaller terraces. In the rock garden proper, including trees and shrubs, were found Tradiscantia virginiana, Achillea lanulosa, Pinus mugho, Viburnum trilobum, Acer palmatum, Hieracium canadense, Ulmus pumila, Spirea vanhoutii, Malus coronaria, Asparagus filicina, Robinia pseudoacacia, Pteris spp., Potentilla recta, Ranunculus acris, Taxus cuspidata\`Hicksii', Chelidonium majus and Muscari botrides. By 1982, many plants had germinated or been grown from cuttings and different species of plants. Only about 90 different species made it to adulthood from the greenhouse and cold frames. Nearly half of these new plants were being grown for the conservatory and the flowerbeds around the house. They included species of Begonia, Fuchsia, Pilea, Euphorbia, Peperomia, Impatiens, Hosta and other indoor plants. The University Administration was not overly interested in returning the President's Estate to its earlier glory and especially not the rock garden as very few guests went to see it during university functions. By the end of 1983 the following wild flowers were successfully introduced the into the gardens; Aguiligia brevistilla, Ranunculus abortius, Lychnis chalcedonica, Saxifraga aizoides, Siline cotripacta, Sedum anacampceros, S. kamtshaticum, S. kamtshaticum Oreo marginatum, Malva sylvestris, M. verticillata, Potentilla tridentata, Potentilla intermedia, P. pentandra, Polemonium corveleum, Atriplex lentiformis, Agastace foenicleum, Campanula carpatica and Plantago lanceolata.

It was used in a scene in which the character of Gilda sings the song \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\", improvising a quick striptease, choreographed by Jack Cole. The dress has helped consolidate the image of the femme fatale, as well as being universally recognized as an icon of fashion and cinema. The Independent named it as one of the Ten Best Fashion Moments in Film. History Jean Louis, Columbia Pictures costume designer, collaborated with the actress Rita Hayworth in nine films from the 1945 until 1959. Louis is considered \\"an essential ingredient in the formula that created the image of Rita Hayworth\\". To create clothes for Gilda, Jean Louis was inspired by Portrait of Madame X, the famous socialite in Paris. According to Life magazine, the wardrobe designed by Jean Louis for Rita Hayworth had a value of about $60,000, a large figure for the time. The dress was said to illustrate that \\"extreme sexuality\\" in women, hot or cold, is a recipe for catastrophe. In 1946, the image of Rita Hayworth in the Gilda black dress was imprinted on the first nuclear bomb to be tested after the Second World War, as part of Operation Crossroads. The bomb, nicknamed \\"Gilda\\", was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of Esquire magazine. Above it was stenciled \\"Gilda\\" in two-inch black letters. In April 2009, the dress was to be sold at the auction of the Forrest J. Ackerman estate. In the description of the lot it was specified that the dress still had the label \\"property of Columbia Pictures\\" and \\"Rita Hayworth\\" sewn inside. The initial price was estimated between $30,000 and $50,000, but the lot was withdrawn before it reached the auction. Later, in September 2009, the dress appeared mysteriously in an auction on eBay with a starting price of $30,000. The scene with the black dress has been referenced in several films. Jessica Rabbit in the Disney film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, performs \\"Why Don't You Do Right?\\" similarly to Rita Hayworth in Gilda. For the 23rd James Bond film Skyfall (2012), costume designer Jany Temime referenced the dress while creating an outfit for Bond girl S√©v√©rine. Design The strapless dress is a sheath in black satin with a straight neckline, leaving the shoulders bare. The dress is long and side-slit down to the ground. In the scene in which it appears, the dress is paired with a pair of full length satin opera gloves. The glove fabric is identical to the dress fabric; not made from cheaper stretch satin. To be able to wear the dress, Hayworth had to wear a corset, because just a few months prior she had given birth to her daughter, Rebecca, and had not yet regained her pre-pregnancy figure. In addition to the dress, Jean Louis made a harness, worn under the dress. The harness consisted of rigging‚Äîone under the breast, one in the middle and one on the side. In addition, the soft plastic had been molded around the top of the skirt.

He became known as a teacher of physics, electrotechnics and mineralogy before advancing to being school director. Personal life He was born in Trondheim as a son of attorney Laurentius Andreas Schulz and Christiane Wilhelmine Ulich. His grandfather was a German immigrant. He was a brother of educator Thomas Norberg Schulz, and thus a granduncle of architect Christian Norberg-Schulz and great-granduncle of opera singer Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz. In July 1889 in Trondhjem he married shipmaster's daughter Gudrun Boye (1866‚Äì1953). He died in August 1944 in Trondhjem, aged 92. Career He finished his secondary education at Trondhjem Cathedral School in 1871, studied philology for one and a half-year and then the sciences. He graduated with the cand.real. degree in 1877, and worked in √Ös and Troms√∏ until May 1878. He was then hired as a teacher at Trondhjem Cathedral School. He also worked at a middle school in the city. In September 1893 he was hired as a teacher of physics, applied physics, electrotechnics and mineralogy at Trondhjem Technical School. He worked two jobs until being let go (following his own request) from Trondhjem Cathedral School in June 1894. Electrotechnics in particular was a new field, so he had to be an autodidact, with several study trips to continental Europe. He wrote the textbook Grundtr√¶k af elektrotekniken in 1909. Trondhjem Technical School went through organizational changes in the 1910s, and Schulz was the school's director from July 1917 to his retirement in 1926. He represented the Liberal Party in Trondhjem city council from 1902 to 1904, and participated in the planning of an electricity works at Lerfossen. He collected minerals for the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, managing their mineral collection from 1878 to 1936, and also donated some to Trondhjem Cathedral School. He also spent much spare time working for the trekking cause. A well- known tourist cabin in Sylan bears his name. He was an honorary member (1937) of the local Polytechnic Society, and was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in 1925.

It was published by Newgrounds in 2007. It was Zeebarf's first point-and-click adventure game with the game company ClickShake Games. The Visitor requires logic and common sense to guide an alien parasite through its new earthly surroundings in this interactive horror adventure. The second Visitor game came out in 2010 and was called The Visitor: Massacre at Camp Happy. It is an eat-and-grow based game in which a player must use cunning to beat the levels, gaining the qualities and sizes from the animals you eat. The third game, The Visitor Returns, was released in 2011. The Visitor The game begins with a meteorite crashing into the water and floating. A small worm-like creature crawls out and stops at the top of the meteorite. The death slug gets onto land and gets flung to a house by a fishing rod after consuming a frog. It lands on a windowsill and ends up consuming a cat after much moving and running. It opens the front door and slithers in to find an old woman and a dog in the kitchen. It uses a knife to kill the old woman and climbs though the air vent to a room where two boys are sleeping. The visitor consumes a pet fish and a bird before travelling into the first boy's mouth and consuming him too. The second boy realises something is happening and snaps awake but the death slug kills him as well. In the last scene a third boy is hiding from the monster in the bathroom. There are three possible endings to this scene, the boy gets a gun out of the cupboard below the sink and kills the visitor, the visitor slips into a bathtub and dies but still kills the boy, or the visitor runs into the bathroom and kills the boy with his tongue. This game is now available to download for the Blackberry Playbook for free. The Visitor: Massacre at Camp Happy In this version of the visitor you control an alien death slug as it rains death and destruction onto a sleepy campground. You must guide him through the mountainous forest grounds of Camp Happy, as he destroys everything in his path in search of human victims. Features original horror music by Sergiu Muresan, 10 large scrolling levels with puzzle elements and action game play, 10 unique campers to devour, each with distinct death animations, 11 different animal types to mutilate throughout, hand-drawn 2D animation, game stat tracking, achievements and automatic game saving. The Visitor Returns The game begins with another death slug landing at a campground. Exiting its meteorite, the slug consumes a raccoon. Making its way to a trailer, it consumes a spider and a skunk, gaining the ability to shoot adhesive silk, scale walls, and vent poison gas. It forces the inhabitants of the trailer to open a window by gassing them through a crack. Climbing through the newly opened window, it consumes a scorpion, growing a stinging tail and throws a sausage on the floor to make the old man drinking what appears to be whiskey at the table send his doberman pinscher outside. Consuming the dog, the monster gains a set of powerful jaws. Re-entering the trailer, it murders the old man by biting his throat out, alerting his wife, who shoots at it. Tricking her into shooting out her window, it climbs in. There are multiple endings, a few of which end up with the slug being shot to pieces. It can suffocate, disembowel, behead, or, ideally, assimilate her.

Biography =Early life and education= Joseph Binzer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of seven children of Robert and Joan (n√©e Metz) Binzer. He received his early education at St. Ann School in Groesbeck, and graduated from La Salle High School in 1973. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business with a major in accountancy from Miami University in 1977. He then worked for eleven years as a Certified Public Accountant with Crowe, Chizek & Co. in South Bend, Indiana, and with Arthur Young & Co. in Cincinnati. =Ordination and ministry= In 1988, Binzer began his studies for the priesthood by entering Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West in Cincinnati. He earned a Master of Divinity degree in 1994. On June 4, 1994, he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Daniel Edward Pilarczyk at the Cathedral of St. Peter in Chains. His first assignment was as a parochial vicar at St. Dominic Church in Delhi, where he remained for three years. He then continued his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he obtained a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1999. After returning to Cincinnati, he served as a resident associate at St. Bartholomew Church in Finneytown and member of the archdiocesan Tribunal. He was master of ceremonies for Archbishop Pilarczyk from 2000 to 2003. In 2003, he was named chancellor of the Archdiocese, pastor of St. Louis Church in Cincinnati, and director of the Archdiocese's Department of Executive Services. In addition to these posts, he became vicar general of the Archdiocese in 2007. =Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati= On April 6, 2011, Binzer was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati and Titular Bishop of Subbar by Pope Benedict XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on June 9, 2011. The Archbishop of Cincinnati, Archbishop Dennis Marion Schnurr, was the principal consecrator. The principal co-consecrators were the Archbishop Emeritus of Cincinnati, Daniel Edward Pilarczyk; and the new Bishop of Joliet, Bishop Robert Daniel Conlon. The episcopal consecration was held at Cincinnati's Cathedral of St. Peter in Chains. =Handling of sex abuse reports= On August 5, 2019, the Archdiocese of Cincinnati announced that Binzer had failed to notify the archbishop of an allegation of sex abuse by a priest and that he was being removed immediately as head of priest personnel. Pending an internal investigation, Binzer remained Vicar General and Auxiliary Bishop. Binzer had informed local police authorities, but not officials of the archdiocese, of the complaints made against Fr. Geoff Drew in 2013 and 2015 and the police investigation did not result in any charges. Drew was suspended from public ministry on July 23, 2019, following the discovery of inappropriate text messages he sent to a teenage parishioners; he had been transferred to a new parish in 2018 after more reports of inappropriate contact with minors. Binzer resigned in August 2019 from the Child and Youth Protection Committee for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The same month, local authorities arrested Drew and charged him with nine counts of sex abuse. =Resignation= Binzer submitted his resignation in late April 2020. On May 7, 2020, Pope Francis accepted Binzer's resignation as auxiliary bishop. Binzer issued a public apology that said he had tendered his resignation after the Holy See concluded in April after its own investigation that his handling of Drew's case had \\"a negative impact on the trust and faith\\" of the people of the Archdiocese.

Called a \\"tautly powerful slow blues\\" by music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, it has been recorded by numerous artists, including early Chicago bluesmen Tampa Red, Sonny Boy Williamson I, and Tommy McClennan. John Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf later adapted \\"Sugar Mama\\" for electric blues and rock group Led Zeppelin reworked it during early recording sessions. Origins Country bluesman Yank Rachell recorded \\"Sugar Farm Blues\\"Charley Jordan recorded a different \\"Sugar Farm Blues\\" in 1932 (Vocalion 1717). on February 6, 1934.Melotone M12958, listed as \\"Poor Jim with Dan Jackson\\" Sonny Boy Williamson I, with whom \\"Sugar Mama\\" is often associated, was an early collaborator of Rachell. \\"Themes that Yank Rachell recorded also turn up in the blues of [Sleepy John] Estes, [Sonny Boy] Williamson, and other artists from the [same] area, and it would be difficult to determine which artist actually created any particular theme\\". Tampa Red song Tampa Red recorded two different versions of \\"Sugar Mama Blues\\" in 1934, shortly after Rachell's \\"Sugar Farm Blues\\". Both are medium tempo twelve-bar blues that featured Red's trademark slide resonator guitar work and vocals. \\"Sugar Mama No. 1\\", recorded May 12, 1934, features the lyrics often found in subsequent versions of the song: \\"Sugar Mama Blues No. 2\\", recorded March 23, 1934,Vocalion 2753 has some different lyrics (although recorded first, it was released later, hence \\"No. 2\\"). Sonny Boy Williamson I song John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson, sometimes identified as the composer of \\"Sugar Mama\\", first recorded the song three years after Tampa Red. The recording took place during his first session for Bluebird Records on May 5, 1937, that also produced \\"Good Morning, School Girl\\", which was used as the flip side for \\"Sugar Mama\\". Williamson's song uses most of the lyrics in Tamp Red's \\"Sugar Mama Blues No. 1\\" as well as the overall arrangement. However, his version features a harmonica solo with guitar accompaniment by Robert Lee McCoy, later known as Robert Nighthawk. Williamson later recorded several versions of \\"Sugar Mama Blues\\". Both Tampa Red's and Williamson's \\"Sugar Mama Blues\\" were released before Billboard magazine or a similar service began tracking such releases, so it is difficult to gauge which version was more popular, although the song has been often identified with Williamson. Later renditions \\"Sugar Mama Blues\\", usually called \\"Sugar Mama\\", has been recorded a by many blues and other musicians including Tommy McClennan as \\"New Sugar Mama\\", 1940 Bluebird 8760 John Lee Hooker,1952 Chess 1515 and 1965 from It Serves You Right to Suffer and B.B. King.1959 Kent 329 Hooker also used the song as basis for several of his own songs, such as \\"Sally Mae\\". In 1964, Howlin' Wolf recorded the song as \\"My Country Sugar Mama\\".Chess 1911 It was performed as a Chicago blues shuffle with lyrics from the Yank Rachell, Tampa Red, and Sonny Boy Williamson songs. The song was credited to Wolf as are many subsequent versions. Taste (1969 Taste), and Fleetwood Mac with Otis Spann (1969 Fleetwood Mac in Chicago/Blues Jam in Chicago, Vols. 1‚Äì2) have also recorded versions of the song. Led Zeppelin song Led Zeppelin recorded \\"Sugar Mama\\" (or \\"Sugar Mama \\" as listed on the album release) during early recording sessions. The song is credited to Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, although biographer Nigel Williamson identifies it as \\"a cover of the Sonny Boy Williamson song\\". Except for bootlegs, \\"Sugar Mama\\" remained unreleased until 2015, when it was included on the reissued version (deluxe and super deluxe) of the album Coda. \\"Sugar Mama\\" was recorded during the same session as \\"Baby Come On Home\\".

AJ Faigin represented four Football Hall of Fame players (Jack Lambert, Jim Kelly, Mike Webster and Mel Blount) who played in eight Super Bowls; as well as numerous Pro Bowl (all star) selections and First Round Draft Picks. After he left the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's office (Cleveland, Ohio), where in his twenties he successfully prosecuted major felony cases including homicides, he was asked by a college and law school acquaintance to join Lustig Pro Sports as general counsel. There he became a seasoned negotiator and recruiter for the firm; and known throughout professional football for his creative strategies in the era before Free Agency was won by football players. Jim Kelly contract negotiations AJ Faigin became noted in the national news when he signed the Buffalo Bills 1983 draft pick to the USFL Houston Gamblers (the first 1st Round NFL pick to choose the USFL) for a then record setting contract.New York Times, Sports, ‚ÄúScouting‚Äù, June 9, 1983 The deal occurred when after at first merely meeting with USFL Chicago GM Bruce Allen to generate leverage, he and his negotiating partner received a famous return call by Allen to Faigin as they sat in the Bills offices about to finalize an agreement. Allen asked him to immediately fly to Toronto for a midnight meeting with USFL money-men at the home of multi-millionaire and league creative guru John Bassett. There they were told they could pick any team in the league.The Sporting News, ‚ÄúPro Football Focus‚Äù by H.

While it succeeded in getting Kosar to Cleveland, it also caused rare havoc in the NFL with open threats of lawsuits among at least five teams. Faigin later said he got the \\"Jerry Maguire handshake\\" from Kosar's father, Bernie Kosar, Sr., and officially never represented his son despite the success on Kosar Jr.'s behalf. Kosar went on to lead Cleveland to three AFC Championship games. Football strike AJ Faigin through iconic linebacker Jack Lambert of the Pittsburgh Steelers tried to redirect the NFL players strike of 1982 with his ‚ÄòModest Proposal‚Äô that called for a fight for free agency rather than the seniority based wage scale the union was seeking. Lambert presented this paper at the strike vote meeting and despite the respect held for him was unable to get the other team player reps, dominated by lineman with longevity, to change course. The long, and ultimately broken strike, effectively ruined the season and accomplished next to nothing for the players‚ÄúBlame Pay Inequities‚Äù by AJ Faigin, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Forum Op. Ed page, Dec. 17, 1982 Faigin v. Kelly libel action AJ Faigin left Lustig Pro Sports in 1987 but was nonetheless later drawn into a lawsuit against the firm and its founder Greg Lustig over investment decisions and tax shelters recommended by Lustig. Faigin was voluntarily dismissed, but sought monetary sanctions. The Federal Judge held AJ Faigin the victim of ‚Äúa frivolous suit‚Äù awarding $13,000 in Sanctions from Kelly and his attorney for joining him in the first instance, and having knowledge that he was not involved with client investments.Kelly v. Huzella, et al., Sec. V.; 5th Circuit Court of Appeals; No. 94-20905 AJ Faigin then brought a libel action against Kelly for false claims in an autobiography that Faigin had advised on investments; however evidence of the Sanctions Award was excluded from evidence and the case was lost.Faigin v. Kelly, et al. (Lawyers Weekly No. 01-182-99) ‚ÄúSanctions Issue‚Äù In Faigin v. Kelly (1st Cir.) 184 F.3rd 67, the court of appeals while refusing to address another crucial assignment of error, gave deference to the trial judge's decision to not allow the jury to hear about the Sanctions. Law professor, business owner Faigin, in the 1990s, lived in Chicago, wrote and also taught Sports Law and Negotiation at Chicago-Kent Law School (Ill Inst. of Tech.). While there he became involved with the national Bill Clinton campaign for president, going to New Hampshire as well as the 1992 Democratic Convention. He later relocated to California where he became a successful business owner in the convention and trade show industry.

St. John the Baptist Church at Skelsmergh dates from about 1871 and was built by Joseph Bintley, a Westmorland architect. Skelsmergh Hall incorporates a pele tower, probably built in 1425, with late 16th century and early 17th century additions. The tower is now an outbuilding. Skelsmergh Hall at Pastscape The River Sprint runs alongside the village and is \\"one of the quietest of the Lake District's valleys\\".The River SprintSkelsmergh had a population of 303 according to the 2011 census. When comparing this to the total population of the village 50 years earlier, in 1961, it is clear that the population has seen an increase from 250 in 1961. An entry by John Bartholomew states that :\\"Skelsmergh, township, in par. and 2 miles NE. of Kendal, Westmorland, 2093 ac., pop. 367.\\" Skelsmergh had a population of 303 according to the 2011 census. It previously had a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of Scalthwaiterigg. Parish Church \\"Skelsmergh church parish was created in the 19th century with the aim to serve the townships of Skelsmergh, Scalthwaiterigg and Patton...The entrance to the churchyard is a monument to those who died from the parish during the First World War\\". \\"The three light East window is of the Crucifixion, designed and executed by Heaton, Butler and Bayne\\". Situated in the nave are two stained glass windows. \\"The cemetery has been extended to a field across the road to accommodate more burials\\". \\"Regular worship in the church is led by the Beacon Team Ministry...Members of the congregation take on the duties of reading, preparing the intercessions and chalice administration...Two members of the congregation take part in the provision of hospital communion, organised by the Beacon Team, at the Westmorland General Hospital\\". The majority of the residents that attend the services are regular and committed to attending, with primary elderly people attending. As expected, Festivals attract more people, with key annual events such as Easter and Christmas Eve 'Carols and Candlelight' hosting larger than normal crowds. Many of the congregation come from outside and beyond the parish but have strong links with the village of Skelsmergh. When looking back over previous records it is thought that there has been a church on or near this site for many centuries, mentioning a small chapel in the region roughly around the mid to late 1600s.\\"The antiquarian the Rev Thomas Machell mentions a ruined chapel in his report on the area in 1692...From the early 17th century the ruined chapel had not been suitable for locals to worship in due its poor state of repair\\". During this poor state of the chapel, those wanting to worship had to travel three or four miles to Kendal to worship at the Parish church of Holy Trinity. In 1870 A local group, the Skelsmergh Chapelry Committee, was set up to promote the building of the church and to raise enough money to build their church. \\"The foundation stone was laid by The Venerable J Cooper on the 5th of May, 1870 only a few months after the committee had set out its plans‚Ä¶ The church was complete by 1870, and finally consecrated on the 2nd of November by the Bishop of Carlisle‚Ä¶ With the consecration of the church, the new chapelry of Skelsmergh, Scalthwaiterigg and Patton was created, with an estimated congregation of around two hundred worshipers\\". Population Population graph of Skelsmergh over time using Census data Between 1881 and 1961 the population of Skelsmergh saw an overall decrease. In 1881 the total population was 367 which showed an increase of 17 from 10 years before. However, in the following 20 years the population began to decrease, going down to 336 in 1891, then further decreasing to 303 in 1901. After rising up again to 329 in 1921, the population began to decrease again with the count being 250 in 1961. When we compare this figure with the most recent Census data report for Skelsmergh in 2011, we can see that the population has seen an overall increase from 50 years previous, as the total population was recorded at 303. When we break down the total population in to males and females, when assessing the 1881 and 1891 count, males were the dominant gender in terms of the number of males in Skelsmergh compared to females. In 1881 there were 197 males in comparison to 170 females, and although both these figures dropped in the following census report in 1891, there were still more males (171) than females (165) occupying the village. For the next three census reports the dominant gender changed with the total female population being larger than the total male population in the 1911, 1921 and 1931 report. Between 1931 and 1961 the total male and female population that made up the overall Skelsmergh total population was very even which can be represented by the figures from the 1961 census report where the total male and female count were both 125. The 2011 Census data report shows that it is the males in Skelsmergh that have a higher population compared with the female population. Of the total population of 303, 161 were males and 142 were females. Although the male population just about has a higher total than the female population in the village itself, it is evident that for the South Lakeland region it is the females that dominate the males with a total of 50,522 males to 53,136 females. Jobs Occupation Skelsmergh 1881 The occupations of the Skelsmergh population vary, with job descriptions varying from managerial and director roles to caring, leisure and other service occupations. According to the 2011 census, of the villages' residents aged 16 to 74, 161 of these were in employment. This figure of 161 contributes to the employment count of 3,228,744 amongst the North West population. The 2011 Census shows that 11.2% of the working population are labelled as either 'Managers, Directors or senior officials'. The highest percentage of the total job count, at 21.7%, appears to be those people said to have 'Professional Occupations'. Of the listed jobs, 'caring, leisure and other service occupations' had the lowest count with just four people, or 2.5%. When we compare the occupations of the residents in recent years and 1881 (in the bar chart on the left) we can analyse how the jobs have varied over time. As we can see it is evident that the male population were in work more compared with the women and this agrees with the ideology at this time where men were seen as the providers with the women at home caring for the children. It is clear that the most occupied job of all of those shown in the chart were those jobs associated with agriculture. Those villagers involved with the agricultural industry were all men at the time the data was recorded in 1881, with over 50 male residents with jobs involved in agriculture. When looking at the most occupied job for the females it is apparent that domestic related jobs were the most occupied by the female population. Although the majority of female workers were involved with jobs linked with domestic roles, the total number of workers was lower compared to the most occupied male job in 1881, reinforcing the idea that men were in work more than the women. However the chart does show that the title of many of the female workers jobs in the village were unknown with no specific job title. Skelsmergh snipet Education There were 14 full-time students in Skelsmergh between the ages of 16 to 74 according to the 2011 Census data and this figure contributes to the 465, 955 full-time students between these ages across the North West region. Of the 14 full-time students, there are 9 that are economically active in employment, 2 that are economically active but unemployed and 3 that are completely economically inactive according to the 2011 Census data. When you compare the data of Skelsmergh with the surrounding South Lakeland region it is clear that the majority of full-time students aged 16 to 74 in the South Lakeland region are economically inactive. However, the data shows that for Skelsmergh 64% of the full-time students are economically active in employment which goes against the overall region trend. Housing The total number of houses in Skelsmergh has seen a change since 1881 when we compare data from this time to the most recent recorded census data in 2011. The lowest housing count between these time periods was in 1901 where there was a total housing count of 63 which was 6 less than 10 years before. When assessing the census data on the total number of houses it is clear that there is an overall increase between 1881 and 2011. The most recent count shows a total number of households at a figure of 136. This figure makes up just a small percentage of the number of houses occupying the South Lakeland region, with the figure recording 46, 552 houses. The 2011 Census data shows that of the 136 houses, 125 were classified as a whole house or bungalow. If we wish to break down the housing type in more depth, this figure of 125 can be sub divided into detached (58), semi-detached (41) and terraced (26) housing, which added together give us this figure. Religion and ethnicity Of the 303 total population the dominant religion is clearly Christian with 178 people confessing to Christianity as their religion, as evident in the 2011 Census data. This figure of 178 is just a very small percentage of the total number of people across the South Lakeland region that are Christian followers. Of the data recorded to discover information about religious beliefs in Skelsmergh, 86 people admitted to have no religion with an additional 36 residents not stating their religion. Of the remaining population 'Jewish' (2) and 'Buddhist' (1) were the only additional religions followed in the village. When examining the variety in Ethnic groups in Skelsmergh using the 2011 Census data, the residents only range over three of the different Ethnic group classifications. 284 of the residents are in the group classified as 'White; English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British', 15 in 'White; Other White' and 4 in 'White; Irish'.

The guides have been updated over time, to adopt new scientific findings and new public health marketing techniques. The current guidelines are the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 - 2020. Over time they have described from 4 to 11 food groups. Various guides have been criticized as not accurately representing scientific information about optimal nutrition, and as being overly influenced by the agricultural industries the USDA promotes.  Earliest guides  The USDA's first nutrition guidelines were published in 1894 by Dr. Wilbur Olin Atwater as a farmers' bulletin. In Atwater's 1904 publication titled Principles of Nutrition and Nutritive Value of Food, he advocated variety, proportionality and moderation; measuring calories; and an efficient, affordable diet that focused on nutrient-rich foods and less fat, sugar and starch. This information preceded the discovery of individual vitamins beginning in 1910. A new guide in 1916, Food for Young Children by nutritionist Caroline Hunt, categorized foods into milk and meat; cereals; vegetables and fruits; fats and fatty foods; and sugars and sugary foods. How to Select Food in 1917 promoted these five food groups to adults, and the guidelines remained in place through the 1920s. In 1933, the USDA introduced food plans at four different cost levels in response to the Great Depression. In 1941, the first Recommended Dietary Allowances were created, listing specific intakes for calories, protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins A, B1, B2 B3, C and D.  Basic 7  The USDA's \\"Basic 7\\" food groups from 1943 to 1956. In 1943, during World War II, The USDA introduced a nutrition guide promoting the \\"Basic 7\\" food groups to help maintain nutritional standards under wartime food rationing. The Basic 7 food groups were: # Green and yellow vegetables (some raw; some cooked, frozen or canned) # Oranges, tomatoes, grapefruit (or raw cabbage or salad greens) # Potatoes and other vegetables and fruits (raw, dried, cooked, frozen or canned) # Milk and milk products (fluid, evaporated, dried milk, or cheese) # Meat, poultry, fish, or eggs (or dried beans, peas, nuts, or peanut butter) # Bread, flour, and cereals (natural whole grain, or enriched or restored) # Butter and fortified margarine (with added Vitamin A)  Basic Four  From 1956 until 1992 the United States Department of Agriculture recommended its \\"Basic Four\\" food groups. These food groups were: * milk * meat * fruit and vegetables * bread and cereals \\"Other foods\\" were said to round out meals and satisfy appetites. These included additional servings from the Basic Four, or foods such as butter, margarine, salad dressing and cooking oil, sauces, jellies and syrups. The Basic Four guide was omnipresent in nutrition education in the United States. A notable example is the 1972 series Mulligan Stew, providing nutrition education for schoolchildren in reruns until 1981.  Food Guide Pyramid  The USDA's 1992 food guide pyramid. The introduction of the USDA's food guide pyramid in 1992 attempted to express the recommended servings of each food group, which previous guides did not do. 6 to 11 servings of bread, cereal, rice and pasta occupied the large base of the pyramid; followed by 3 to 5 servings of vegetables; then fruits (2 to 4); then milk, yogurt and cheese (2 to 3); followed by meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts (2 to 3); and finally fats, oils and sweets in the small apex (to be used sparingly). Inside each group were several images of representative foods, as well as symbols representing the fat and sugar contents of the foods. A modified food pyramid was proposed for adults aged over 70. This \\"Modified Food Pyramid for 70+ Adults\\" accounted for changing diets with age by emphasizing water consumption as well as nutrient-dense and high-fiber foods.  MyPyramid  MyPyramid, the revised USDA food pyramid. In 2005, the USDA updated its guide with MyPyramid, which replaced the hierarchical levels of the Food Guide Pyramid with colorful vertical wedges, often displayed without images of foods, creating a more abstract design. Stairs were added up the left side of the pyramid with an image of a climber to represent a push for exercise. The share of the pyramid allotted to grains now only narrowly edged out vegetables and milk, which were of equal proportions. Fruits were next in size, followed by a narrower wedge for protein and a small sliver for oils. An unmarked white tip represented discretionary calories for items such as candy, alcohol, or additional food from any other group. MyPlate The MyPlate nutrition guide MyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the United States Department of Agriculture, consisting of a diagram of a plate and glass divided into five food groups. It replaced the USDA's MyPyramid diagram on June 2, 2011, ending 19 years of food pyramid iconography. The guide will be displayed on food packaging and used in nutritional education in the United States. Dietary Guidelines The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in the USDA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services jointly released a longer textual document called Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 - 2020, to be updated in 2020. The first edition was published in 1980, and since 1985 has been updated every five years by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. Like the USDA Food Pyramid, these guidelines have been criticized as being overly influenced by the agriculture industry. These criticisms of the Dietary Guidelines arose due to the omission of high- quality evidence that the Public Health Service decided to exclude. The phrasing of recommendations was extremely important and widely affected everyone who read it. The wording had to be changed constantly as there were protests due to comments such as ‚Äúcut down on fatty meats‚Äù, which led to the U.S Department of Agriculture having to stop the publication of the USDA Food Book. Slight alterations of various dietary guidelines had to be made throughout the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to calm down the protests emerged. As a compromise, the phrase was changed to ‚Äúchoose lean meat‚Äù but didn't result in a better situation. In 2015 the committee factored in environmental sustainability for the first time in its recommendations. The committee's 2015 report found that a healthy diet should comprise higher plant based foods and lower animal based foods. It also found that a plant food based diet was better for the environment than one based on meat and dairy. In 2013 and again in 2015, Edward Archer and colleagues published a series of research articles in PlosOne and Mayo Clinic Proceedings demonstrating that the dietary data used to develop the US Dietary Guidelines were physiologically implausible (i.e., incompatible with survival) and therefore these data were \\"inadmissible\\" as scientific evidence and should not be used to inform public policy. In 2016, Nina Teicholz authored a critique of the US Dietary Guidelines in the British Medical Journal titled The scientific report guiding the US dietary guidelines: is it scientific? Teicholz suggested that \\"the scientific committee advising the US government has not used standard methods for most of its analyses and instead relies heavily on systematic reviews from professional bodies such as the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, which are heavily supported by food and drug companies.\\" The 2020-2025 guidelines were to be released in Spring 2020.https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-programs- policies/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines See also *List of nutrition guides *5 A Day * Fruits & Veggies ‚Äì More Matters *Nutrition facts label References Category:Nutrition Category:United States Department of Agriculture Category:Publications of the United States government ","title":"History of USDA nutrition guides"},{"id":"31974060","text":"Salah Bachir, , O.Ont (born October 3, 1955) is a much-honored Canadian patron of the arts, entrepreneur, philanthropist, magazine publisher and the President of Cineplex Media.

Beginnings Bachir was born in Lebanon and in 1965 his family immigrated to Canada when he was just 10 years old at the midst of the Lebanese Civil War and they resided in Rexdale, a district of Toronto. He was one of five siblings in the family. His mother ran a successful dress boutique out of the basement of their house. Salah played numerous sports when he was growing up, including hockey (he was a goalie), football (quarterback) and lacrosse. When he was 15-years-old, he picketed outside a Dominion store to support Caesar Chavez and the farm workers during the grape boycott. As people passed him during the day they offered up small donations to support the cause ‚Äì Bachir's first foray into the world of fundraising. He remembers that even though his father didn't agree with his actions, he topped up the fund, giving $50 to bring the total for the day to $150. Bachir was excited and nervous to have the opportunity to hand the funds to Chavez himself, who was visiting Toronto, and somewhat reluctantly said they had only raised $150. He's never forgotten what Chavez said to him: \\"It's $150 more than we had this morning.\\"  Professional life  Bachir began his career in publishing in 1979 with the launch of his elder brother's company, Videomania, Canada's first publication targeted to consumers of a new home entertainment format: the video cassette. In 1984, Bachir started a trade publication, Premiere, to serve the needs of the burgeoning video distribution and retail sectors. He also produced an annual trade show, Focus on Video, celebrating the Canadian film industry. In 1999, Bachir launched Famous magazine ‚Äî soon joined by Famous Qu√©bec ‚Äî a movie/entertainment magazine distributed through the Famous Players movie theatre chain (since purchased by Cineplex Entertainment LP).

Cineplex Magazine also had the strongest digital readership of 70 consumer magazines as measured by a 2016 Vividata study, attracting 1.5 million digital-only readers for a typical issue; Cineplex Magazine is also the second most read title in Canada with 4.4 million readers. In 1999, Bachir also became President of Famous Players Media, a company he co-owned with Viacom to sell in-theatre advertising and which revolutionized the movie experience.

Salah Bachir has chaired or participated the capital campaigns of numerous organizations including the 519 Community Centre, the Canadian Film Centre, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Art Gallery of Ontario among others. He was instrumental in driving the capital campaign in support of The Commons @ 401 Richmond, where The Bachir-Yerex Presentation Space stands as a tribute to his work. He is known by many in the fundraising community as ‚ÄúGala Salah‚Äù due to the number of galas he chairs. These include the annual 519 gala in support of the 519 community centre, where he holds the position of honorary patron in recognition of his contributions to the facility; the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Gala; the annual Salah Bachir Show gala in support of St. Joseph's Health Centre Foundation; the Wild Bird Ball in conjunction with Margaret Atwood in support of the Pelee Island Bird Observatory; Camp Ooch's Imagine the Magic gala; and others.

His support for the Art Gallery of Ontario has meant better public programs and world-class exhibitions for thousands of visitors, and he also gives his time to support emerging artists. Healthcare, including research, is another of Bachir's signature issues. Not only has he supported tens of millions of dollars in research projects, but he is a critical voice for patients in the Toronto community. He has helped raise millions for hospitals in Toronto, including giving $2.5 million to build a new dialysis centre at St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto, his own community hospital. He cares deeply about patient comfort and has also donated funds to purchase many patient care comfort items including new televisions for the chemotherapy and dialysis clinics.

He was also a founding member of the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research. Bachir became the honorary patron of The 519 Church Street Community Centre after chairing its successful capital campaign. Under his direction, the campaign raised more than $6-million to expand the facilities at the community centre in Toronto's Church and Wellesley neighbourhood. His fundraising efforts exceeded projections by $2-million. In May 2010 the 519's new wing was named in Bachir's honour to recognize him as the driving force behind the effort, as well as his own pledge of $1 million. In 2013, Bachir, himself a kidney dialysis patient, recognized the need to upgrade the televisions used by hundreds of dialysis and chemotherapy patients in the renal and oncology units of St. Joseph's Health Centre and organized his ‚ÄúNon-Gala Gala,‚Äù which raised more than $250,000 for the cause. With the entertainment system upgraded, Bachir turned his attention to improving the centre's aging facilities. In February 2015, Bachir hosted \\"The Salah Bachir Show,\\" which raised $650,000 to help build a new dialysis centre at St. Joseph's, and pay for new equipment. St. Joseph's will soon start work on the Bachir Yerex Family Dialysis Unit, named to honour Bachir for his efforts to contribute, and raise, more than $3-million of the $10-million needed for the new state-of-the-art facility. Salah is also the honorary chair of St. Joseph's annual Share your Light Festival, for which he donated an installation of lights that cover the side of the hospital and can be enjoyed throughout the holiday season by those travelling Toronto's Gardiner Expressway.

A nutrition guide is a reference that provides nutrition advice for general health, typically by dividing foods into food groups and recommending servings of each group. Nutrition guides can be presented in written or visual form, and are commonly published by government agencies, health associations and university health departments. Most countries also have nutrition facts labels which are not listed here; many of those reference specific target amounts for various nutrients. Historical guides =Ancient Greece= The Hippocratic Corpus of Ancient Greece contains one of the earliest known nutrition guides. It recommends a seasonal diet. For winter, it advises eating a heavy diet of bread and roasted meat and fish, while avoiding vegetables and restricting liquids to, if anything, strong wine. It then recommends a lighter summer diet of soft barley cake, vegetables, boiled meat, and large quantities of diluted wine. Gradual transitions between these two diets are advised in the intervening months. =Imperial China= During the Tang Dynasty, Chinese physician Sun Simiao is believed to have written the first nutrition guide in traditional Chinese medicine. In his book, Precious Prescriptions for Emergencies (), the chapter \\"Dietary Treatment\\" () contains sections describing the effects of eating fruits, vegetables, grains and animals. =First food pyramid= Amid high food prices in 1972, Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of \\"basic foods\\" that were both cheap and nutritious, and \\"supplemental foods\\" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. KF, a consumer co-op that worked with the Board, sought to illustrate these food groups. KF developed a food pyramid because it could depict basic foods as its base, and introduced the guide to the public in 1974 in their magazine, Vi. At the base were bread, cereals, potatoes, milk, cheese and margarine; above it was a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and at the top was an apex of supplemental meat, fish and eggs. The pyramid competed with the National Board's \\"dietary circle,\\" which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, plus West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992. Today, both the Swedish government and KF have moved to the Plate Model. Government guides =Australia= The Australian Department of Health and Ageing publishes The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, which features a wheel divided into five sections: approximately 40 percent bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles; 30 percent vegetables and legumes; 10 percent fruit; 10 percent milk, yogurt and cheese; and 10 percent lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and legumes. Below the wheel are reminders to drink plenty of water and eat fats and sweets occasionally or in small amounts. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender, life stage and activity level. =Austria= The Austrian Federal Ministry of Health uses The Austrian Food Pyramid (), which is divided into 25 blocks, each block representing a daily serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six servings of non-alcoholic beverages (preferably low-energy drinks like water, tea, unsweetened fruit juice and vegetable juice); three servings of vegetables and legumes; two of fruit; four of cereals, bread, pasta, rice and potatoes (preferably whole grains); three of milk and dairy (two \\"white,\\" like milk, yogurt or cream cheese, and one of yellow cheese); one of fats and oil (preferably olive or canola oil); three of meat, fish, sausage and eggs (preferably fish or lean meat); and three of fatty, sweet and salty foods (though not nutritionally recommended and to be consumed rarely). =Belgium= The Voedingsdriehoek is a (mostly in Flanders) widely used tool for dietitians, health educators, schools, etc. to explain a balanced diet. The triangle is constructed as a pyramid with five different layers. The bottom layer is the largest in area, so the most important, the top is narrow and there represents little food, although it is an essential ingredient. The layers are (from top to bottom): \\\\- Oil / fats \\\\- Protein: meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, meat substitutes \\\\- Fruits and vegetables \\\\- Starch or carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.) \\\\- Drinks In 2005 a (rather symbolically) layer was added at the bottom: sports and exercise. This is not a food, but an important part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. The information services use the \\"active\\" food pyramid. =Brazil= Brazil's Ministry of Health publishes the Food Guide (), which features a map of Brazil depicting each of Brazil's five regions as puzzle pieces representing a food group. However, Brazil's food recommendations differ from the map, and feature eight food groups: rice, bread, pasta, potato and cassavas (5 servings a day); vegetables and legumes (3 servings); fruits (3); milk, cheese and yogurt (3); beans (1); meat, fish and eggs (1); oils and fats (1); and sugars and sweets (no more than one). =Canada= Canada's Food Guide from Health Canada was updated and released in January 2019. It promotes eating a variety of healthy foods each day and filling half your plate with vegetables and fruits, and the other half with protein foods and whole grain foods. It promotes making water your drink of choice and encourages healthy eating habits such as cooking more often and enjoying meals with others. The 2019 Guide no longer classifies food into the four food groups from previous versions and it does away with recommended servings.Government of Canada. Canada's Food Guide. https://food- guide.canada.ca/en/ Retrieved 23 January 2019. The previous version had four food groups: vegetables and fruit (7 to 10 servings a day for adults, depending on biological sex), grain products (6 to 8), milk and alternatives (2), and meat and alternatives (2 to 3). Canada developed its first nutrition guide in 1942 as part of its wartime nutrition program. =China= China's Ministry of Health uses the Balanced Diet Pagoda (), which is divided into five stories ascending from largest to smallest. Cereals are at the large base; topped by vegetables and fruits; then fish, poultry, meat, eggs and other animal foods; followed by milk and soy foods; and topped with fats and oils in the small spire. Beside the pagoda are images representing water and exercise. =Denmark= Denmark's Food Administration uses the Diet Compass () to depict its \\"Dietary 8\\" () guidelines, with an image on each compass point representing a guideline. Those guidelines are: \\"Eat 6 fruits and vegetables a day,\\" \\"Eat fish and seafood several times a week,\\" \\"Eat potatoes, rice or pasta and whole wheat bread every day,\\" \\"Cut back on sugar,\\" \\"Cut back on greasy foods,\\" \\"Eat a varied diet and maintain a normal weight,\\" \\"Quench your thirst with water,\\" and, \\"Be physically active at least 30 minutes a day.\\" =France= France's National Institute for Prevention and Health Education has 25 separate food guides under the title The Food Guide For All (). Each guide is based on a consumer's personality, habits and lifestyle. There are guides for people who: are health-conscious, don't care about food, prepare family meals, are poor, eat at restaurants, skip meals, don't cook, have large appetites, are on diets, prefer certain foods, avoid various foods (including meat), are sedentary, are athletic, and more. Each guide features a \\"portrait\\" in the image of a happy face designed out of foods representing that consumer's type. The portraits are billed as nutrition recommendations, though they are more decorative than informative. =Germany= Germany's state- funded Aid Information Service uses the Food Pyramid (), which divides a pyramid into 22 blocks, each block representing a hand-sized serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six blocks for beverages, three for vegetables, two for fruit, four for grains, three for dairy, one for meat and fish, one for oils, one for fats, and one for sweets and alcohol. Beverages, vegetables, fruit and grains are marked green for \\"free travel\\"; meat and dairy are marked yellow for \\"caution\\"; and oils, fats, sweets and alcohol are marked red for \\"brake lights\\". Aid also collaborated with the German Nutrition Society to create a 3D pyramid model. =India= India's National Institute of Nutrition publishes the Dietary Guidelines for Indians, which, among other diagrams, includes the Food Pyramid. The pyramid has a base of beans and legumes to eat adequately, a second layer of vegetables and fruit to eat liberally, a third layer of meat, fish, eggs and oils to eat moderately, and an apex of fatty, salty and sugary foods to eat sparingly. Accompanying the pyramid is a recommendation of regular exercise and physical activity, as well as warnings against drinking alcohol and smoking. =Ireland= The island of Ireland's Food Safety Promotion Board uses The Food Pyramid, which is divided into five levels: bread, cereals and potatoes at the large base (6 or more servings); then fruit and vegetables (5); followed by milk, cheese and yogurt (3); then meat, fish, eggs and alternatives (2); and finally fats, high fat/sugar snacks, foods and drinks at the apex (small amounts). At least 8 cups of water a day are also recommended. =Israel= The Food Pyramid () from Israel's Ministry of Health is divided into six levels. At the wide base is water; followed by starches, including pasta, bread, corn and yams; then fruits and vegetables; then meat, fish, eggs and dairy; then fats and oils; and finally sugary foods at the small apex. Images around the pyramid represent exercise. =Italy= The Italian Ministry of Health uses the Italian Food Pyramid (), which is divided into squares, triangles, trapezoids and rectangles that represent one, one-half, one-and-a- half, and two servings, respectively. Beginning from the base, the divisions are: fruit (2 servings), water (1), vegetables (2), bread (1.5), biscotti (0.5), potatoes (0.5), rice and pasta (1.5), meat (1), eggs (0.5), fish (0.5), legumes (0.5), cold cut meats (0.5), milk (0.5), dairy (0.5), oils and fats (1), sweets (0.5) and wine or beer (0.5). Along the edges of the pyramid are triangles representing physical activity. The pyramid is intended to represent the variety of foods eaten over an entire week, averaged into daily portions. Also provided is an alternative, more traditional pyramid for a single day, divided into six layers representing six food groups; as well as two additional pyramids for children. =Japan= The Food Guide (), from Japan's Health and Agriculture ministries, is depicted as a spinning top with a wide upper layer tapering to a narrow bottom. At the large upper level is a staple meal of carbohydrates, including rice, bread and noodles (5 to 7 servings a day); followed below by a side dish of vegetables, potatoes, beans (except soybeans), mushrooms and seaweed (5 to 6); then a smaller main course of protein, including meat, fish, eggs and soy (3 to 5); and finally the narrow point, divided between dairy (2) and fruit (2). The top's handle is filled with \\"essential\\" water and tea, and running in circles around the handle is a figure representing moderate exercise. A small motion line beside the top represents sweet beverages in moderation. =Mexico= Mexico's Department of Nutrition and Health Promotion uses The Plate of Good Eating (), which is divided into thirds: vegetables and fruits (in equal proportion); cereals; and legumes and animal products. The guide further recommends eating \\"many\\" vegetables and fruits and \\"enough\\" cereals. The legume and animal products section is subdivided, and \\"few\\" animal products are recommended, while the guide recommends combining the larger legume section with cereals. Additional recommendations are to include each of the three food groups in each of the three main meals of the day, to eat the greatest possible variety of food, to eat according to individual needs and conditions, and to eat the least possible fats, oils, sugar and salt. =Netherlands= The Netherlands Nutrition Center uses the Wheel of Five (), which is divided into five groups: approximately 30 percent vegetables and fruit; 30 percent bread, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, couscous, and legumes; 16 percent dairy, meat, fish, eggs and meat substitutes; 16 percent beverages; and 8 percent fats and oils. More specific recommendations are provided based on age and gender. =South Korea= South Korea's Korean Nutrition Society uses the Food Bicycle (), with a small front wheel filled with water and a large rear wheel composed of approximately one-third grains; 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and beans; 20 percent vegetables; 12 percent fruits; 12 percent dairy; and 3 percent oils and sugars. A person is pedaling the bicycle, representing exercise. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage. Before 2010, South Korea used a food pagoda model very similar to China's current guide. =Spain= Spain's Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality uses the NAOS Pyramid (), which promotes a Mediterranean diet as well as plenty of physical activity, and is drawn as a sailboat on water. It is divided into beverages and water at the base; an equal division between physical activity and a combination of grains, vegetables, tubers, fruit, olive oil and dairy in the second level, which is labeled \\"several times a day\\" and color-coded green; an equal division between sports and a combination of meat, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts in the third level, which is labeled \\"several times a week\\" and is color-coded orange; and an apex of saturated fats, sugars, salt, and sedentary activity labeled \\"occasionally\\" and color- coded red. =Sweden= Sweden's Food Agency uses the Plate Model (), which divides a plate into approximately 40 percent potatoes, rice, pasta and bread; 40 percent vegetables and fruit; and 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and legumes. People requiring more energy are allowed a larger share of carbohydrates, while people who are overweight can make up to half their plate vegetables and fruit. Previously, Sweden used the Dietary Circle created in 1963, while Swedish consumer cooperative KF created the world's first food pyramid in 1974. =Switzerland= Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health uses the Food Pyramid () developed by the Swiss Society for Nutrition. At the base is 1 to 2 liters of liquids, preferably non-sugared beverages; then three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit of different colors; followed by whole grains, beans, cereals and potatoes to be eaten with each meal; then three servings of milk or dairy; one serving of meat, fish, eggs, cheese or another protein; oils, fats and nuts daily in moderation; and an apex of sweet/salty snacks and sweetened/alcoholic drinks in moderation for pleasure. =Turkey= Turkey's Ministry of Health uses the Basic Food Groups (), a four-part division of milk and dairy; meat, eggs, fish, legumes and seeds; vegetables and fruit; and bread and cereal. Each food group is accompanied by bullet points, such as serving recommendations or advice to eat more raw vegetables and whole grains. =United Kingdom= The Eatwell plate, as described by the United Kingdom's NHS and FSA. The United Kingdom's Department of Health published Dietary Reference Values. These are equivalent to the easier to understand Eatwell plate used by the National Health Service. This consists of roughly one-third fruit and vegetables (\\"at least 5 portions\\"); one-third bread, rice, potatoes and pasta (\\"plenty\\"); a smaller amount of milk and dairy (\\"some\\"); meat, fish, eggs and beans in the same proportion as dairy (\\"some\\"); and a small wedge of fatty and sugary foods. =United States= MyPlate, from the United States Department of Agriculture In the United States, the Department of Agriculture uses MyPlate, a plate icon divided into approximately 30 percent grains, 30 percent vegetables, 20 percent fruits and 20 percent protein, accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy. Additional recommendations include to enjoy food but eat less, avoid oversized portions, make at least half of grains whole, switch to fat-free or low-fat milk, choose foods with less sodium, and drink water instead of sugary drinks. Previous USDA food guides include the Basic 7 (1943‚Äì1956), the Basic Four (1956‚Äì1992), the Food Guide Pyramid (1992‚Äì2005), and MyPyramid (2005‚Äì2011). The National Institutes of Health uses the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan for people seeking to lower their blood pressure. DASH differs from MyPlate in that the protein category is replaced by a smaller proportion of lean meats, poultry, and fish; there are separate sections for fats and oils, legumes, and sweets; and fruits and vegetables don't constitute half of the diet. The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in the USDA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services jointly release a longer textual document called Dietary Guidelines for Americans, updated in 2015 with the next scheduled revision in 2012. Dietary Reference Intake values are published by the Institute of Medicine for general use, but nutrition facts labels in the U.S. use the older Reference Daily Intake standards instead. =World Health Organization= The World Health Organization uses The 3 Fives, a guide featuring five key points in each of three categories. The three categories are safer food, a healthy diet, and appropriate physical activity. In the healthy diet category, the five keys are: \\"Give your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months of life,\\" \\"Eat a variety of food,\\" \\"Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit,\\" \\"Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil,\\" and \\"Eat less salt and sugar.\\" Each key includes bullet points with further recommendations. The 3 Fives was originally developed for distribution at major sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup, but it can also be used for general audiences. Before The 3 Fives, the WHO used the CINDI dietary guide, which included the CINDI pyramid. The guide was intended to help European health professionals and policymakers develop their own national nutrition guides. The pyramid has a large green base representing approximately two-thirds of the triangle's area, which is filled with vegetables, fruits, grains and starches. A middle layer shaded orange for \\"caution\\" is divided into two equal sections: low-fat milk and dairy; and beans, lentils, legumes, fish, eggs, poultry and lean meat. At the top is a small \\"red zone\\" of fats and sweets. =Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)= FAO provides technical assistance to countries for developing, revising and implementing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) and food guides in line with current scientific evidence. FAO also carries out periodic reviews on progress made in the development and use of dietary guidelines. FAO's food based dietary guidelines website collects more than 80 national guidelines. Other guides *The American Diabetes Association uses the Create Your Plate system, which divides a plate into three sections: non- starchy vegetables (the largest section), starchy foods, and meat or meat substitutes. Like MyPlate, the ADA complements its plate with a glass of low- fat or nonfat milk. *The German Nutrition Society () publishes the Food Circle (), which is divided into 30 percent cereals and potatoes; 26 percent vegetables and salad; 17 percent fruit; 18 percent milk and dairy; 7 percent meat, sausage, fish and eggs; and 2 percent fats and oils. Beverages, represented by a glass of water, are placed in the interior of the circle. *The Harvard School of Public Health uses the Healthy Eating Pyramid, which is split into nine sections, including a base of daily exercise and weight control. Compared to MyPlate, grains become whole grains, with refined grains in a \\"use sparingly\\" category; protein is split between \\"fish, poultry and eggs\\" and \\"nuts, seeds, beans and tofu\\" with red meat and processed meat in a \\"use sparingly\\" category; healthy fats and oils have their own section; and dairy can be substituted with calcium and vitamin D supplements. To the side of the pyramid are alcohol in moderation and a daily multivitamin. *The Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services uses the Plate Method, which shows a plate that is one-half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains and starches, and one-quarter meat and protein. *Overall Nutritional Quality Index *The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine uses the Power Plate, which promotes a vegan diet and is divided into equal parts fruit, grains, legumes and vegetables. *The University of Michigan Health System uses the Healing Foods Pyramid, which consists of 11 sections, including a base of water. Compared to MyPlate, it adds sections for legumes, seasonings, healthy fats, and eggs. Lean meats are in a weekly category, as are fish and seafood. An optional category includes alcohol, tea and dark chocolate. *The [LiveWell for LIFE] project uses National Plates to show the ideal composition of diets in various EU countries that are both healthy, environmentally sustainable and affordable. This concept was pioneered by WWF in the UK and is now financially supported by the European Commission under the LIFE Plus programme(see Sustainable diet).

The dress was created by costume designer William \\"Billy\\" Travilla and was used in one of the most famous scenes of the film, which subsequently became the subject of numerous imitations, significantly from Madonna in the music video for her 1985 song \\"Material Girl\\". History Original sketch When the costume designer William Travilla, known simply as Travilla, began working with Marilyn Monroe, he had already won an Oscar for his work in Adventures of Don Juan in 1948. Travilla designed the clothes of the actress in eight films, and later claimed to have had a brief affair with Monroe. In 1953 Travilla designed the costumes for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Originally, Monroe was to wear a breathtaking show girl costume, costing close to $4,000 (1953 dollars). It had jewels sewn onto a black fish-net bodystocking up to the breasts, then covered in nude fabric, embellished with a mass of diamonds. During production, it became public knowledge that Monroe had posed nude for a calendar in 1949, before she became well-known. Travilla was given strict instructions to design a new, less revealing costume in order to distance Monroe from the scandal. He designed the pink dress as a last minute replacement. The pink dress was worn by Monroe in the role of the character of Lorelei Lee in the famous sequence in which the actress sings the song \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\", the choreography accompanied by several suitors in dinner clothes. The pink dress was auctioned at Profiles in History on 11 June 2010, with an estimated price of between $150,000 and $250,000 and described as \\"the most important film costume to ever come to auction\\". The dress ultimately sold for $370,000. Travilla's notes reveal that she wore two identical copies in that scene as it took a long time to shoot and the dress being floor length was very prone to getting dirt on it. Due to the fact there was no digital retouching back when the movie was filmed, Travilla had to get 2 dresses made so Monroe could change into the spare one when the one she wore showed dirt. Lot 832: Marilyn Monroe pink satin gown from the ‚ÄúDiamonds are a Girl‚Äôs Best Friend‚Äù number in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. This pink satin gown was worn by Marilyn Monroe as the gold-digging ‚ÄúLorelei Lee‚Äù in one of cinema‚Äôs most memorable song and dance sequences as she performed ‚ÄúDiamonds Are a Girl‚Äôs Best Friend‚Äù. This Travilla-designed pink silk satin strapless gown features black satin lining on the oversized bow attached at back. Features integral brassier with rear zipper closure (concealed with bow overlay) and interior Fox cleaning tag. Also comes with the original pair of screen-worn opera-length tubes worn over Marilyn‚Äôs arms (gloves are shown for display only) and pink satin belt with ‚ÄúM. Monroe A-698 1-27-3-7953‚Äù written on the inner leather lining. Originally designed to be a two-piece garment, this lot features an additional bonus having the original top made for this dress (featuring interior bias label handwritten ‚Äú1-27-3-7971 M.

Indeed, Marilyn Monroe‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiamonds Are a Girl‚Äôs Best Friend‚Äù performance has reached such an iconic status that several notorious entertainers have copied it‚Äîright down to the pink strapless gown!Profiles in History Auction Catalogue This is the only known example to survive. Marilyn Monroe wore a white version of this dress (without the bow) to the premiere of her film There's No Business Like Show Business (1954). She was photographed extensively wearing this dress with a white fur stole and with a pair of matching opera gloves. Design Monroe was originally going to wear a pair of black opera gloves with black Salvatore Ferragamo pumps but Travilla decided to change the colour of the gloves and shoes to match the gown. The satin dress, designed by William Travilla, is a strapless, floor- length shocking pink dress with straight neckline, with uncovered arms and broad shoulders and side slits. Jeweler Harry Winston loaned the diamond jewelry Marilyn wore in the performance The dress is decorated with a big bow stuffed with ostrich feathers and horsehair on the back and a belt, both in the same shade of her dress. The dress was complemented by a pair of long opera length gloves to match, and satin stiletto-heeled shoes by Salvatore Ferragamo. The dress is peau d'ange satin and is a shade of pink often identified as \\"shocking pink\\". Impact on popular culture Over the years the pink dress has become an icon of fashion and film, and like her white dress is often imitated and parodied. One of the most famous of all is the one represented by the singer Madonna in the music video for her 1985 hit \\"Material Girl\\". Madonna on the cover of the magazine Music Connection showing her own version of the dress. In a segment entitled \\"Material Girl\\" in the 1997 Playboy Video, Playboy's Voluptuous Vixens, SaRenna Lee capitalized on her resemblance to Marilyn Monroe by appearing in a pink dress designed for her zaftig shape. Mexican entertainers Thalia and Aida Pierce each wore similar shocking pink dresses. Thalia wore a replica of this dress while performing \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\" in Spain in 1991, and Pierce wore a similar pink dress in a 2001 episode of Humor es...los comediantes as a tribute to Monroe (2001 would have been Monroe's 75th birthday). In the computer game The Sims: Superstar expansion pack published in 2003, the player can see the character of Marilyn Monroe, dressed in the same famous shocking pink dress. It was also produced as a Mattel Barbie doll with Barbie wearing Monroe's pink dress.

The weather data generated was accessed by dialup modem and included wind speed, wind direction, barometric pressure, temperature, and rainfall totals, along with daily minimum and maximum values of each. The network of primarily school-based weather stations became the first to generate real-time meteorological data for use on broadcast television when the AWS network was first referenced on September 11, 1992 during the nightly newscast of WUSA-TV (Channel 9) in Washington, D.C.Cyr, Emily. Topper Shutt  Chief Meteorologist  wusa9.com. 23 February 2011. 31 May 2011 . The AWS concept encouraged academic and recreational institutions to increase localized community awareness by soliciting donors to help them join the network. A computer and software interfaced to the weather station, provided access to each site, and enabled the user to download near real-time and archived surface weather observations. The meteorological data were then used in the classroom as part of multiple curricula. The real time data was shared with the general public on broadcast media and provided to the National Weather Service (NWS) for internal use and eventual integration into AFOS (Automation of Field Operations and Services), the computer system in place at the time linking NWS offices for the transmission of weather data now known as AWIPS. Headquartered in Darnestown, Maryland, the Automated Weather Source partnership formed in 1992 was incorporated in January 1994. Implementations of AWS‚Äô core concept, often referred to as ‚ÄúSchoolNet‚Äù or ‚ÄúWeatherNet,‚Äù then began to expand into many other major US television markets over the course of the 1990s.Automated Weather Source Network Demo. Dir. Topper Shutt. Automated Weather Source. 1993.Automated Weather Source TV Promo. Dir. Topper Shutt and WUSA-TV 9. 1993.  History  = Initial AWS methodology = Prior to the formation of the AWS partnership formed in 1992 by founders Bailey and Shutt, Bailey, an amateur weather enthusiast, worked with meteorologist Andrew Stern, then lead forecaster at the Sterling, Virginia National Weather Service forecast office. Stern and Bailey initially compiled code to access and download observations via dialup phone modem from a HeathKit 5001 weather station. In an effort to access the data more efficiently, Bailey acquired a weather station produced by Texas Weather Instruments (TWI) that allowed direct access to the weather data. The TWI instrument, known as a Weather Report, became one of the first sources for local, hourly weather observations by a non-standard weather data platform to be accessed by the National Weather Service (NWS) and ingested into AFOS in the Washington, D.C. area. = Creation of AWS network = As a NWS storm spotter, and having previously worked as an intern and weather watcher for WRC-TV,Girard, Keith F. \\"Storm Spotters Keep Eyes on Skies.\\" The Washington Post 9 May 1985: MD1. Bailey recognized the importance of localized weather data for on-air TV use. He provided Shutt with access to the weather data engine and began discussions on how and where other similar weather stations might be deployed and used in nightly local weather broadcasts. Locations considered included ski resorts and parks. Shutt suggested placement at schools, as they were at the time beginning to acquire computers and dedicated phone lines for access to remote data sources. Subsequently, Shutt and Bailey formed the Automated Weather Source Partnership, funding the purchase and donation of three weather stations to Washington-area schools to seed what became the nation‚Äôs first public school network of weather stations to generate weather data for use on broadcast TV at WUSA-TV. On September 11, 1992, Automated Weather Source Network became an on-air reality and its use quickly grew in the nation‚Äôs 8th largest TV market DMA. = Network growth = Within a year Montgomery, Fairfax, Howard and Loudoun County Public Schools were the first of the local technology and transportation coordinators that joined the AWS network as it grew to over thirty sites in the Washington area. The Automated Weather Source Network segment was self-promoting on air and became a community outreach tool for WUSA-TV 9. Wisp Resort, in Garrett County, Maryland, was the first ski area to purchase a unit and dedicate a phone line for access. Other Mid-Atlantic ski resorts followed suit as ‚ÄúSki- net‚Äù evolved. Stevenson shelters were built and used to house the outdoor sensors on the roofs of existing sites that appeared in the Automated Weather Source Network television segment. The AWS network had grown to 30 sites as the data sets generated were also used to provide near real-time observations from school rooftops. AWS agreed to provide NWS access to the data from the network on an hourly basis for integration into the AFOS computer system. Data from each AWS station was compiled and transcribed in ASCII format . A typical observation would output to file as follows:Texas Weather Instruments. \\"Downloads -- Weather Instruments by Texas Weather Instruments, Inc.\\" 27 September 2001.

Computer science had just begun its integration into K-12 schools in major metropolitan areas. The use of computers and dial-up modems with access to digitized resources was in its infancy at the time of AWS‚Äô founding. A weather station as an engine that provided real-world data could then be integrated into each area of school curricula. Promoting such a concept by recognizing specific schools or locations on broadcast TV helped instill local civic pride. The near real-time observations used by TV broadcast media made viewers more aware of the weather conditions where they worked and lived. Television networks‚Äô use of the meteorological observations encouraged the growth of the AWS concept and the participation of local businesses in the growing effort to donate resources to help facilitate this cause. As the Washington, D.C. metro area school systems bought into the concept, AWS began working on a way to better archive and manipulate the data generated for use as a teaching tool for computer science, mathematics, geography, and science. Students would log observations and then plot them on a local map, and a series of manually logged observations would be graphed as well. Eventually, an AWS subcontractor wrote a program that would automatically access the existing sites and download data for current observations as well as limited historical data. The program, which ran on desktop computers outfitted with 386 processors, then created graphs of historical data.Hotchkiss, Mari R. \\"Company Paves Meteorological Information Highway.\\" Computer Digest (1994): Vol. 9 No. 3.  Criticisms and acceptance  AWS‚Äô founders and employees chose school rooftops to place their weather stations because of such locations‚Äô accessibility, security, proximity to electrical power and ease of maintenance. The standard location for most sensor suites at that time was at airports, in the middle of large fields, or between runways with no physical obstructions that might disturb the immediate environment.National Weather Service. JetStream -- Automated Surface Observing Systems. n.d. 31 May 2011 Meteorologists both in the NWS and the private sector expressed concern that AWS sites might be subject to a number of confounds, such as the skewing of wind direction by rooftop structures, the heat retained on dark rooftop surfaces, and the hot exhaust from rooftop air conditioning units, all of which were thought to cause inaccuracies in the data.Leffler, R.J. and J.W. Schiesl. \\"Issues Concerning the Interpretation of Non-Standard Temperature Observations by National Weather Service Forecast Offices.\\" National Weather Service (1994).Meyer, S.J. and K.G. Hubbard. \\"Nonfederal Automated Weather Stations and Networks in the United States and Canada: a Preliminary Survey.\\" American Meteorological Society (1992): 449-457. Despite these concerns, meteorologists used AWS data to assist in the study of various weather phenomena, including the heat island effect. One such study, presented to the American Meteorological Society by Davey et al. of Colorado State University, cited examples and placement of multiple AWS network sites.Davey, Christopher A., et al. \\"Differences Between Rooftop and Ground-Based Surface Temperatures.\\" 6th Symposium on Integrated Observing Systems, 82nd AMS Annual Meeting. Orlando: Colorado State University, 2002. 6.2. Each mesonet site was subject to environmental factors which differed from the official configuration of an NWS-certified ASOS weather station. As rooftop weather station configurations grew more widely available, however, rooftop observations became an accepted measure of meteorological data dissemination in the scientific community, with an understanding that the sites were considered nonstandard configurations. Armed with the metadata that highlighted the biases in rooftop observations, meteorologists used rooftop data in their forecasts at their own professional discretion. = Steps toward incorporation = The WUSA-TV Automated Weather Source Network on-air segment soon attracted the attention of Bill Mengel, then founder and owner of EAI Corporation.EAI Corporation. Dossier: EAI Info. 18 March 1997. 29 May 2011 EAI products included the manufacturing of air sensors for commercial and military use. Mengel sent then-EAI employee Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Marshall to meet with AWS founders Shutt and Bailey to discuss the possibility of manufacturing a more sophisticated weather station. EAI‚Äôs background in air monitoring equipment, along with the engineering background of Marshall and Christopher Sloop, an engineer and computer programmer at EAI, brought a valuable skill set to the partnership. The discussions led to the development of a prototype of the first AWS-manufactured weather station and data display unit as well as the development of refined software needed to access and utilize the AWS network in schools and on-the-air.Earth Networks, Inc. Weather Station -- Earth Networks. 2011. 31 May 2011 .

In May 1834, in order to avoid debtors' prison, his father, John Sutter Sr. left his family in Switzerland, departing for the United States. Eventually the elder Sutter settled in California. While in California, initially the father's fortunes had seemed to improve. The son was afterwards raised by his single mother, Anna Sutter, and put through counting school.Sutter, John A. Jr. & Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943. Pages 3-12. While the younger Sutter was still a minor living in Europe, Sutter Sr. had decided to transfer to his son, some of his land holdings from the Mexican land grant which he called New Helvetia. Word eventually reached Sutter Jr. that while his father was in California, he had again managed to get himself back into debt. In 1848, with the aim of helping manage his father's business affairs, John Sutter Jr. emigrated to California. =Sacramento= John Augustus Sutter Sr. When Sutter Jr. arrived at New Helvetia, he found Sutter's Fort to be overrun by loiterers and drunkards, and felt that the situation required improvements in organization and leadership. Soon after his son's arrival, Sutter Sr. departed for Coloma, California, where gold had recently been discovered, to start a business selling supplies to gold prospectors. Despite the fact that his father had been planning on starting a town to be named Sutterville, Sutter Jr. planned and began to implement his own vision for a city near the fork of the American & Sacramento Rivers. This was the beginning of the City of Sacramento which was then named Sacramento City for real estate promotional purposes.Sutter, John A. Jr. & Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943. Pages 12-18.Sutter's Fort in Sacramento, California The change of plans put a strain on the relationship between father and son. Sutter Jr. became ill and rarely left the family's residence, Hock Farm, on the Feather River. As Sutter Jr.'s illness continued, he grew tired of his responsibilities. He contemplated selling his land, but thought that it would be difficult to sell such a large property. Some businessmen from Sacramento City heard that Sutter Jr. was interested in selling his land. They worked together to buy the land from Sutter Jr., but not by the most honest means. The businessmen, including Sam Brannan, would not bring the contract to purchase the land to Sutter Jr. at Hock Farm, so he took a powerful medicine and met them in Sacramento City to sign the terms of the deal. After reading the contract Sutter Jr. did not like the terms, but the businessmen urged him to sign the contract, get out of California and go somewhere with a climate more suitable to his condition. He reluctantly signed the deal.Sutter, John A. Jr. & Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943. Pages 18-38. =Acapulco= Being rid of the property and the obligation to take care of it, in 1850, Sutter Jr. moved south to find a climate that suited his needs. He made it as far as Acapulco, Mexico. There he met his first wife, Mar√≠a del Carmen Rivas. They were married in the latter part of 1850. Having recovered his health but never any money from his earlier business dealings he returned to California to try and force payment. Brannan waited until August was desperate then offered him $40,000 as payment in full for what was the final slice of his father's land. Panic stricken young August agreed but even then received no cash, only notes for which he signed receipts for $100,000 of which he also never saw a dime. Brannan's company then buried August with lawsuits to the point that he gladly received a mere $3,500 after which August still found himself in debt just over $300. With his nerves and health in shambles again and with nothing left to sell he again ran back to Mexico amid accusations of his squandering his father's fortune. In 1852, his first son, John Sutter III, was born in Northwest Mexico. During this time Sutter Jr. was involved in many court cases over the sale of his property to Brannan and the lack of payment for the property. In some instances, these court cases went all the way to the Supreme Court of California. These court cases did not benefit Sutter Jr. except to release him of the burden of caring for the estate.Sutter, John A. Jr. & Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943. Pages 38-48. In Acapulco, Sutter Jr. worked and was partner in a small general store. When the principal owner died, Sutter took his share of the business. Because the business did so well, the Sutters were able to build a house near the ocean. In 1865, Sutter Jr., on the recommendation of a U.S. Commercial Agent, became the Vice-Commercial Agent for the Port of Acapulco. Because of the ill health of the Commercial Agent, Sutter took his position in 1868. Many of Sutter's friends and business associates in the U.S. and Mexico wrote letters to President Johnson requesting that Sutter be made a U.S. Consul. The United States Department of State granted the requests and opened a full consulate in the District and Port of Acapulco. Sutter was named the U.S. consul by President Grant and U.S. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish on July 13, 1870.Sutter, John A. Jr. & Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943. Pages 48-60. Sometime around 1862, Sutter Jr.'s first wife, Mar√≠a, left him. He was not able to get a proper divorce before she left. In 1870 Sutter Jr. met Nicolasa Sol√≠s and began a relationship with her. This relationship would last until Sutter Jr.'s death. Because he could not properly take care of the divorce from his first marriage, Sutter Jr. and Sol√≠s did not marry until 1894. On May 24, 1887, he retired from his post as U.S. Consul to Acapulco. He and his wife lived on their plantation near Acapulco until his death. After his death, his wife had a difficult time keeping their property in Mexico. At this time, there was a revolution in Mexico. The Indians wanted land that they felt originally belonged to them. The revolutionaries targeted many American citizens and made life hard for the Sutters. Much of their property was destroyed. Sol√≠s moved, with her children, to San Francisco and for years fought to get back the Mexican land and some of the land in Sacramento that she felt belonged to her and her children, but to no avail.Sutter, John A.

He composed it in Leipzig for Pentecost Monday and first performed it on 29 May 1724.  History and words  Bach probably wrote the cantata in his first year in Leipzig for Pentecost Monday. He based it on a congratulatory cantata , composed in K√∂then. The music of the 1724 version is lost, but a version of 1727 is extant. Possibly the 1724 version was even closer to the secular work than the existing version. The unknown poet wrote parodies for six of the eight movements of the congratulatory cantata, including two recitatives in movements 1 and 5. Bach did not use movements 6 and 7 in this church cantata, but movement 7 was used in a later work, . The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Peter for Cornelius (), and from the Gospel of John, \\"God so loved the world\\" from the meeting of Jesus and Nicodemus (). The poetry is a general praise of God's great goodness towards men. Only movements 1 and 4 relate to the Gospel; the first stanza of movement 4 is a close paraphrase of the beginning of the gospel text, \\"\\" (For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) This verse became the opening chorus of , for the same occasion a year later. Bach first performed the cantata on 29 May 1724.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, two flauto traverso, two violins, viola and basso continuo, whereas the original secular cantata is scored for only soprano and bass soloists. # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Aria (alto): # Aria (soprano, bass): # Aria (soprano, tenor): # Chorus:  Music  Bach gave the first movement to the tenor instead of the soprano in the secular work and changed the vocal line considerably, but wrote these changes into the original part. Movement 4, a paraphrase of the quotation from the gospel, is a duet, which handles three stanzas in ever richer variations: the first stanza is for bass and strings in G major, the second in higher D major for soprano and additional flutes, the final one for both voices in A major and with more figuration. The structure of this duet is unique in Bach's cantatas, the variations in rising keys, and the increase in instruments and musical texture all add to illustrate the exaltation mentioned in the title of the cantata. For the Baroque, the exaltation of the noble employer of the secular cantata could be adapted without change to the exaltation of God. The final chorus, based on a duet as movement 8 of BWV 173.1, is partly expanded to four parts, but in homophony.

The Cuisine of Asunci√≥n refers to the cuisine and restaurants of the city of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. Compared to most of the Latin American capitals, the city has comparatively few European restaurants and influences in cuisine. However, international (including Italian, Chinese, Mexican and others) and traditional Paraguayan cuisines are available in various restaurants and hotels. Restaurant cuisine Sopa paraguaya is a traditional Paraguayan food. Meat, especially beef, is a staple food of the Paraguayan diet. However, Asunci√≥n is different in some respects compared to the rest of Paraguay in that its top restaurants are more sophisticated and broader in culinary influences than in rural areas and smaller towns, where often only snack bars are available. Bradt Travel Guides says of the eatery situation: \\"You can eat very well in Asuncion, and even vegetarians will find plenty of good salads to fill their plates, even in the churrasquerias (restaurants serving roast meals). But most restaurants and bars in the interior of the country are very basic. Most ordinary restaurants serve a small variety of meat dishes, accompanied by chips, rice salad, potato salad or a mixed salad (lettuce, tomato, onion). It is common to skip dessert entirely\\". In Asunci√≥n, a special dish served in parillada, an upscale restaurant, is made of grilled meat served with manioc. Many of restaurants in the city serve Paraguayan cuisine, and many bars such as Bohemia, Bambuddha, Cafe Literarui, La Cubana and Coyote feature live music during the evenings. However, in recent years the city has seen a marked increase in Asian influences to cater to the many immigrants from the Pacific-Rim countries, such as Japan, China and Korea. Some restaurant such as La Vide Verde offer a stark alternative to the Paraguayan carvery tradition by serving Chinese vegetarians dishes. Although compared to the capital cities of many of the other Latin American cities the diversity of cuisines on offer are less apparent, the European influence is clear restaurants such as Talleyrand which serves International cuisine and the Britannia Pub, a British pub serving British cuisine and alcohol. La Flor de la Canela serves Peruvian cuisine, mainly fish and seafood dishes and ceviche (marinated raw seafood). Some of the more upmarket restaurants with international cuisine available are located in some of the city's top hotels or in close proximity to them. The Excelsior Hotel for instance has a restaurant catering in Italian cuisine, and the Quebrancho restaurant near La Misi√≥n Hotel matches the hotel in being one of the city's most expensive. A few very expensive restaurants serve delicious river fish surubi in many a combination, and one such is with a bed of broad beans and tomatoes. Asparagus soup with plenty of shredded carrot and onion sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, tilapia in escargot sauce and filet steak with fresh mushroom and baby potatoes are also popular in these restaurants. Some special dishes served in popular restaurants are sandwiches, curried rabbit, garlic pizza, surub√≠ casa nostra (many types of different pasta on one dish), sopa paraguaya (a combination with cheese and onion), Lebanese swamis (meat and spice wrapped in bread) in Monte Libano and ceviche.

It's hard to talk about it without giving something away. But there is a mystery, there is a solution and there is in the truest sense of the word a detective. It's just that it doesn't manifest itself in the usual way.... I had this plot idea, which I mentioned to George, because I thought it should be sharp and funny and very New York... because the plotting gets fairly complex in the second act, he [Furth] bogged down. So I wrote that act and then we started to edit each other's stuff. The collaboration became blended as we went over each other's work. I suspect in two years we won't know who wrote which lines.

Critical response The Variety reviewer wrote of the Old Globe production: \\"Ultimately though, the focus of this show is on the two authors, who use a conventional murder-mystery form to create a darkly humorous exploration of evil and corruption. You won‚Äôt miss the songs from this Sondheim show, but you might just miss the powerful human insight and emotional power of his best shows.\\"Taylor, Jonathan. The Doctor Is Out 'Variety, September 18, 1995 Stefanie Buettner, in commentary for The Sondheim Review wrote: \\"The actors, who are all about as big a Broadway star as one can be nowadays, make for a terrific ensemble cast, the set is spectacular, and there is even some appropriately creepy background music. The writing is not great prose, but who expects great drama in a thriller? Of course, you have to take this play for what it is: it's not probing into the depth of the human soul, it also won't be in line for the next Pulitzer - but that's fine with me.\\" Buettner, Stefanie. \\"Thoughts on 'Getting Away'\\" sondheim.com, accessed September 11, 2015 See also * The Last of Sheila * Sleuth References External links Getting Away with Murder, theater review by Jeremy Gerard for Variety (17 March 1996) * A Most Sinister Gathering of Not-So-Usual Suspects, theater review by Vincent Canby for The New York Times (18 March 1996) * Getting Away with Murder, script and performance rights from Dramatists Play Service Category:1996 plays Category:Broadway plays Category:Plays by George Furth Category:Plays set in New York City Category:Comedy thriller plays ","title":"Getting Away with Murder (play)"},{"id":"31974850","text":"Richard Plunkett (c.1340-1393) was an eminent Irish judge and statesman of the fourteenth century, who held the offices of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

Established in 1938 by P.K. Ewing, the station was owned by the Ewing family for 60 years. WGRM is currently owned by Christian Broadcasting of Greenwood, Inc. WGRM broadcasts to the northwestern central region of Mississippi. In the 1940s, the station aired live gospel performances by the Famous St. John's Quartet of Inverness, Mississippi, whose young guitarist would later find fame as B.B. King. As of late 2017/early 2018, WGRM-AM is off-air. History =Early days= This station first signed on the air in 1938 with studios in Grenada, Mississippi. The station, broadcasting at 1240 kilohertz with 250 watts of power, was assigned the call sign \\"WGRM\\" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1939, the station relocated to the second floor of a building at 222 Howard Street in Greenwood, Mississippi, where it would remain for a decade. The station launched under the ownership of P.K. Ewing, Sr., with Fayette C. Ewing as general manager. By 1943, with the Ewing family in control, Herb Abramson was named the station's program director. The station derived much of its programming from the Blue Network but also aired local music programs daily plus blocks of local religious programming on Sundays. By 1945, Lorene Wood was named program director and the station added programming from the Keystone Broadcasting System. The next year, with the sale of the Blue Network, WGRM switched affiliations to remain with NBC and Shelton Morgan became the program director. By the end of the 1940s, Grace Harris took over the program director role. =Blues history= B.B. King performing in France in 1989 B.B. King in 1990 In the early twentieth century, the voices of African Americans were rarely heard on the radio in the Southern United States. A notable exception to this rule was live broadcasts of gospel music. In the 1940s, WGRM aired live performances by gospel groups on Sunday afternoons, including the Famous St. John's Quartet of Inverness, Mississippi. Some sources place the first appearance of the quartet on WGRM in 1940 and some in 1943, but all agree that the group featured young Riley King on guitar in his broadcast debut. After several years, Riley King moved to Memphis where he took on the nickname \\"Beale Street Blues Boy\\" which was in turn shortened to B.B. King. In the early 1950s, pianist Bobby Hines, bluesman Matt Cockrell, and L.C. \\"Lonnie the Cat\\" Cation all recorded songs in these studios. The Mississippi Blues Commission has placed a historical marker at the (now former) WGRM studios and they were the third stop added to the Mississippi Blues Trail, highlighting locations critical in the development of blues music. =New studios= In 1950, the station relocated north of the Tallahatchie River to new studios at 600 Walnut Street. The station's programming remained steady through the early 1950s with Lew Sadler becoming program director by 1955. Later that year, however, station founder P.K. Ewing, Sr., died and his wife, Myrtle M. Ewing (listed initially as simply \\"Mrs. P.K. Ewing\\"), took both ownership and operational control of the station as executrix of his estate. By 1958, Myrtle Ewing had direct ownership of WGRM and named Ed Smith program director. By 1961, Myrtle Ewing had joined her late husband and control of WGRM passed to Fayette Ewing as the executor of her estate. In 1963, the station upgraded its daytime signal to 1,000 watts while maintaining a nighttime power of 250 watts. Fayette Ewing retained his position as the station's general manager throughout the 1960s and into the late 1970s. By 1966 Clay Ewing was named WGRM's commercial manager. Thomas E. Ewing took on a variety of roles with the station in the late 1960s including promotions manager, program director, news director, and chief engineer at various times. =1970s= In 1971, the station described its musical format as middle of the road\\" with some programming provided by the NBC Radio network. Clay Ewing was drawn away from the station for a few years when he was elected mayor of Greenwood, Mississippi, in 1973. He would serve in that role until 1977. In 1974, the ownership of the station and broadcast license were transferred from personal ownership by Fayette Ewing to a new company named Twelve-Forty, Inc., still wholly owned by him. By 1976, the station's format was reported as a mix of oldies music, country & western, and middle of the road with specialty blocks of farm news and classical music. At the same time, Clay Ewing began to assume some of the general manager duties for the station. In 1979, the music shifted back to just middle of the road, retaining the classic and farm specialty programs, and Thomas E. Ewing took on new responsibilities as president of the corporation. After the death of Fayette Ewing, control of license holder Twelve-Forty, Inc., was passed involuntarily to his estate with his widow, Frances Groover Ewing, as executor. In May 1979, the FCC formally approved the transfer of control from the estate to Frances G. Ewing directly. =New generation= WGRM programming took a subtle shift to contemporary beautiful music in 1980 and dropped the classical music programs. The shift was short- lived as by 1982 the station's format was back to middle of the road. A more significant change took place in 1987 as the station went to \\"unlimited\\" 24-hour 1,000 watt broadcasting, maintaining the daytime power but quadrupling the station's power output at night. The station also made the move to a modern adult contemporary music format. In 1988, Clay Ewing took sole custody of the general manager title in addition to his general sales manager role. The station also increased its farm programming to 12 hours per week. In November 1988, Frances G. Ewing applied to the FCC to voluntarily transfer control of Twelve-Forty, Inc., to Clay Ewing. The FCC accepted this application on December 1, 1988, approved the transfer on January 13, 1989, and the transaction was formally consummated on February 20, 1989. In May 1989, as station ownership was working to put new sister station WGRM-FM on the air, WGRM applied to the FCC for a construction permit to simultaneously raise the height of its broadcast antenna and lower the wattage output of the transmitter. These changes would allow the station to share a single, taller broadcast tower with the new FM station and maintain its restricted broadcast coverage area. The FCC granted the permit on September 5, 1989, with an 18-month deadline expiring on March 5, 1991. In October 1990, the station notified the FCC that construction on the new tower was complete and the FCC granted WGRM a license to cover the changes on December 11, 1990. =Willis era= In December 1998, after six decades of Ewing-family ownership, Clay Ewing and Twelve-Forty, Inc., reached an agreement to sell WGRM and sister station WGRM-FM to Willis Broadcasting Corporation, based in Norfolk, Virginia. Willis Broadcasting Corporation was wholly owned by Levi E. Willis, Sr. The FCC approved the deal on February 22, 1999, and the transaction was formally consummated on March 31, 1999. When Willis Broadcasting Corporation acquired WGRM and WGRM-FM, it owned only one other radio station: WIZK in Bay Springs, Mississippi. Although it would later sell WIZK, by mid-2005 the company held the broadcast licenses for eight radio stations across Louisiana and Mississippi. In July 2005, owner Levi Willis applied to the FCC to transfer the licenses for WGRM and WGRM-FM to a new company called Christian Broadcasting of Greenwood, Inc. These would be the only two stations held by this new company. The FCC swiftly approved the transfer on July 29, 2005, and the transaction was formally consummated on January 1, 2006. Christian Broadcasting of Greenwood's sole shareholder, Levi E. Willis, Sr., died on February 20, 2009, at the age of 79. In March 2009, his estate notified the FCC of the involuntary transfer of control of the license holder. The FCC approved the transfer of control to the Estate of Levi E. Willis, Sr., with Joseph L. Lindsey as executor, on May 13, 2009. On May 14, 2017 WGRM changed their format to top 40/CHR, branded as \\"Hot 1240\\". (info taken from stationintel.com) Former personalities Past on-air personalities on WGRM include Rose Mathews Ewing, known as the \\"Weather Lady\\", who read weather forecasts on WGRM and WGRM-FM while her husband Clay Ewing owned the stations in the 1980s and 1990s. Rose Ewing died of heart failure in May 2006 at the age of 66. Clay Ewing died six months later on November 23, 2006, at the age of 67. In addition to his role with the radio stations, Clay Ewing served one term as mayor of Greenwood from 1973 to 1977. Awards and honors In 2005, WGRM air personality Gwendolyn Riley was one of six nominees in the \\"Mississippi Gospel Radio Announcer of The Year\\" category at the 27th Annual Cingular Wireless Mississippi Gospel Music Awards. Riley began her WGRM career in 1991.

Position Paper - The Opioid Crisis in North America  On 2 October 2017, the Global Commission published a position paper on the opioid crisis in North America\\"The Opioid Crisis in North America\\", globalcommissionondrugs.org, 2017.. This opioid-driven public health crisis has reached alarming proportions, contributing in 2016 to an estimated 64,000 deaths from drug overdoses in the US, and some 2,500 in Canada. The members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, several of whom faced similar crises while occupying the highest levels of government in their own countries, share in this position paper their views and recommendations on how to mitigate this epidemic.  2017 Report - The World Drug Perception Problem: Countering Prejudices About People Who Use Drugs  While previous reports by the Global Commission on Drug Policy showed how the potential harms of drugs for people and communities are exacerbated by repressive drug control policies at local, national and international levels, the Global Commission's 2017 report, \\"The World Drug Perception Problem - Countering Prejudices About People Who Use Drugs\\" \\"The World Drug Perception Problem: Countering Prejudices About People Who Use Drugs\\", globalcommissionondrugs.org, 2017. focuses on how current perceptions of drugs and people who use them feed into and off prohibitionist policies. Indeed, drug policy reforms have been difficult to design, legislate or implement because current policies and responses are often based on perceptions and passionate beliefs, and what should be factual discussions leading to effective policies are frequently treated as moral debates. The present report aims to analyze the most common perceptions and fears, contrast them with available evidence on drugs and the people who use them, and provides recommendations on changes that must be enacted to support reforms toward more effective drug policies.  Position Paper - Drug Policy and The Sustainable Development Agenda  The Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 are meant to be a transformational agenda to eradicate poverty, achieve gender equity or save the planet through their implementation. This implementation, based on coherent public policies, is still lacking at the national, regional and international levels. This is most visible in drug policy, where voices from health, human rights and science call for reform, while most countries continue to privilege ideology through law-enforcement and militarization. The members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy draw from their experience at the highest policy and political levels to provide an analysis of how - beyond powerful words and slogans - sustainable development is impeded by drug control while providing a single, groundbreaking recommendation to address this situation.  2018 Report - Regulation: The Responsible Control of Drugs  The Global Commission on Drug Policy released its 2018 report on the responsible control of drugs in Mexico City. The report examined in detail how governments can take control of currently illegal drug markets through responsible regulation, thereby weakening criminal organizations that now profit from the illegal markets. The new report provided a roadmap for transitioning from illegal to legally regulated drug markets. It offered answers regarding the organizational capacity of state institutions to regulate and control a legal market of potentially dangerous products. It highlighted the challenges facing impoverished populations that constitute the ‚Äúworking class‚Äù of the illegal drug markets. It offered possible ways forward to deal with the risks inherent to the resilience of organized crime. Finally, this report called for a reform of the prohibition- based international drug control system, which is compromising a universal and holistic approach to the ‚Äúdrug problem‚Äù.\\"Regulation: The Responsible Control of Drugs\\", globalcommissionondrugs.org, 2018.  Position Paper - Drug Policy and Deprivation of Liberty  This paper shows how the deprivation of liberty for non-violent drug crimes is a wrong and ineffective response, notably because it does not take into account the social and psychological root causes of drug consumption, nor does it consider the economic and social marginalization of low-level actors in the trade. Furthermore, people who are incarcerated are vulnerable, exposed to risks, particularly health risks, for which they are not well-equipped and do not receive adequate care. In this report, members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy analyze the last thirty years of over incarceration in closed settings, from prisons to migrant administrative detention and from mandatory treatment to private rehabilitation centers. The paper highlights the responsibility of the State towards people who are incarcerated, and demonstrates how their health and well-being are at risk.  2019 Report - Classification of Psychoactive Substances: When Science Was Left Behind  In Classification of Drugs: when science was left behind, the Global Commission on Drug Policy explains how the biased historical classification of psychoactive substances has contributed to the \\"world drug problem\\". It is the first-ever comprehensive report providing a political reading of the current evaluation and classification, or \\"scheduling\\" of drugs according to their harms. Psychoactive substances should be classified with regard to their potential for dependence and other harms. This is not the case today, where some substances are legally available because they are considered beneficial (medicines) or culturally important (alcohol), while others are seen as destructive, and are strictly prohibited. The classification of drugs is at the core of the international drug control system. As such, governments must ensure that such a classification is pragmatic and based on science and evidence, makes clear the benefits and harms of drugs, and allows for responsible legal regulatory models to control drugs.

The FCC granted the license on September 9, 1991. =Changes= In December 1994, the station applied for permission in increase its effective radiated power to 6,000 watts. The FCC granted the request on August 16, 1995. Less than two weeks before this decision, the station applied for a new construction permit to relocate the broadcast tower to , increase the effective radiated power to 25,000 watts, and to upgrade the station from Class A to Class C3 at a new frequency of 93.9 MHz. The FCC granted this permit on January 26, 1996. While that construction was underway, the station applied for still further changes to tower height, effective radiated power, and transmitter location on August 8, 1996. The FCC granted these revised parameters on March 18, 1997. In August 1997, the station applied for a new license to cover these changes and the FCC granted it on December 29, 1997. The station filed a final application in May 1998 to change its tower height, antenna height, and power to the allow it to share an antenna with its AM sister station, WGRM, as the owners had prepared for in 1989.

The FCC granted the new construction permit on August 28, 1998. =Willis era= In December 1998, after six decades of Ewing-family broadcasting history in Greenwood, Clay Ewing made a deal to sell both WGRM-FM and AM sister station WGRM to Willis Broadcasting Corporation, based in Norfolk, Virginia. Willis Broadcasting Corporation was wholly owned by Levi E. Willis, Sr. The FCC approved the deal on February 22, 1999, and the transaction was formally consummated on March 31, 1999. When Willis Broadcasting Corporation acquired WGRM and WGRM-FM, it owned only one other radio station: WIZK in Bay Springs, Mississippi. Although it would later sell WIZK, by mid-2005 the company held the broadcast licenses for eight radio stations across Louisiana and Mississippi. In July 2005, owner Levi Willis applied to the FCC to transfer the licenses for WGRM and WGRM-FM to a new company called Christian Broadcasting of Greenwood, Inc.

Cyclists on the walk- and cycleway. Project Twin Streams is an umbrella name for a number of initiatives centred on two streams (Opanuku and Oratia) in the former Waitakere City Council area of Auckland, New Zealand. It consists of a number of environmental and community initiatives and infrastructure. This includes wetland restoration, largely carried out through volunteer work, partly to mitigate the effects of floodwaters from the WaitƒÅkere Ranges. The intent is also to protect/reclaim the 100-year floodplain from encroaching buildings and infrastructure. The project was achieved successfully, including 156 full and partial property purchases, despite a political decision not to use the legally available option of compulsory property purchases. The conservation works, both for the streams and the wider catchment, won second place in the International Thiess Riverprize in 2007.  Walk- and cycleway  One of the most visible initiatives is the well-received Twin Streams Walk- and Cycleway, which allows residents and visitors to wander or ride most of the length of the two streams and some of their tributaries. The specification requirements included lighting for the path (which has since been installed, and provides extended use hours in the evening and morning, though not during some parts of the night), and at the time of installation, the lighting for the paths was the largest LED lighting project in New Zealand. The 3m wide paths, with some 2.5m wide side paths, were funded by a combination of Infrastructure Auckland and Land Transport New Zealand grants / subsidies. The construction of the paths in the 2000s at that time included 5 bridges, 11 boardwalks, 5 retaining walls and a number of property purchases, for a total of slightly more than $10 million. The project also included a variety of local artworks, from ceramic tiles to cultural markers and kinetic sculptures, with a budget of $380,000. The walk- and cycleways and its lighting won several awards, including: * 2010 Illuminating Engineering Society - Lighting Design Award * 2010 Royal Astronomical Society of NZ (RASNZ) - Dark Sky Award for Lighting * 2009 NZTA and Living Streets Aotearoa Golden Foot Award - Best Practice Walking Facility * 2009 Cycling Advocate Network (CAN) Avanti Award - Best Cycle Facility  References   External links  *Project Twin Streams Category:Waitakere City Category:Cycling in New Zealand Category:Conservation projects in New Zealand Category:Environment of the Auckland Region ","title":"Project Twin Streams"},{"id":"31975138","text":"Lawrence Townsend (August 13, 1860 ‚Äì March 8, 1954) was an American diplomat and later in life, after his retirement from government service, a business executive in Washington, DC.

She spent most of her life in Switzerland and is notable for emphasizing the importance of the intangible aspects in organizations and in business strategies. She coined the term ‚ÄúHuman Systems Engineering‚Äù and gave it to a Master of Advanced Studies Program she developed at the HES-SO (University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland). After she handed over the direction of this program to a successor, she developed a new area of interest in the field of ‚Äúsocietal innovation‚Äù. Muth is a trans woman and activist for the transgender community. She was assigned a male gender at birth and lived and published under the names Christophe Muth, Christoph Muth and Chris Muth until she was 58. She transitioned high-speed in less than 6 months and in the public eye with an exemplary support of her employer, her students, her colleagues and her clients.  Early life and education  Muth was born in Rheydt / North Rhine- Westphalia, a borough of M√∂nchengladbach in a family of textile industrials. Their Lutheran faith led the family of her maternal grandfather to refuse the membership in the Nazi NSDAP Party, which endangered her family and brought several troubles during the era of the Third Reich. After the end of World War II in 1945, the strict religious attitude paid off: 15 years of booming success and wealth in part due to business with the Allied forces which privileged partners who had not been Nazis. In 1960, when it was clear that the German textile industry would get into heavy troubles under the pressure of Asiatic competition, Muth's mother dropped her job and withdrew out of this branch. She moved with her second husband to the Lausanne area. Hence, Muth was educated in the French and later in the Italian speaking area of Switzerland. She gained her diploma for access to university in Bellinzona. She studied Economic History and Sociology at the Geneva University where she had the opportunity to work and share ideas with intellectuals like Edgar Morin, Jean Ziegler, Jean Piaget and Paolo Freire. Muth earned her Ph.D. in 1991 at the Swiss Campus of La Jolla University, San Diego, where she attended lectures with Paul Watzlawick and Henri Laborit. Her doctoral thesis (in German) was about private and public academic education (Erfolg und Marketing von Privatuniversit√§ten).  Professional experience in the post ‚Äô68 context  In the post ‚Äô68 movement, Muth opted for a politically liberal attitude promoting alternative businesses rather than violent confrontation with the system. In her view, these businesses had the advantage to develop an in depth understanding of the realities and constraints in management rather than judging and condemn. She initiated several businesses or assisted interested groups in the launch. The condition for her participation was always a participative or better self-governed management model (autogestion). The objectives of the initiatives in which she participated invariably focused on sustainability, empowerment and creating jobs for those who were in trouble finding appropriate work in line with their values. Despite her values and intentions, Muth was harshly criticized because of her management style which was perceived by some as pseudo-democratic and authoritarian. Some of the businesses she started made it to survive until today, the most notable and where she had a leading role as founder-manager for 6 years is probably Voyages APN in Geneva, originally a travel agency and coach transport company in the legal form of a cooperative. Ten years after her departure from this company the staff took over the company, discarded the form of the cooperative and instated private ownership.  Development of management and strategy concepts  Later, Muth was active in technology valorization, M&A;, succession management and organization development. In 20 years of consulting for public and private organizations of every size and any kind, she has often accepted high risk assignments when the survival of the organization was at stake. She initiated and managed several turnarounds in organisational cultures and mostly privileged working on the intangible factors to resolve critical situations, such as communication, motivation, teamwork, corporate culture. Most of the time, her approach proved to be the right one if compared with approaches based exclusively on structures, facts and figures. Muth has provided consultancy to major companies at a high hierarchical level in Switzerland and Europe, like UBS, Swiss Re, CS, Swisscom, and Electrolux. From a methodological point of view, Muth was strongly influenced by Systems thinking (Frederic VesterVester F., Ausfahrt Zukunft, Heyne Verlag 1990 and James Grier MillerMiller J.G., Living Systems, McGraw-Hill 1978), the model of the triune brain (Paul D. MacLean), Existential Analysis (Viktor Frankl)Frankl V., Der Mensch auf der Suche nach Sinn, Klett Verlag 1972 and by the sociological research carried out by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.Csikszentmihalyi M., Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Harper and Row 1990 In her role as main researcher and developer for the Leonardo 3.4.5 methodology she condensed this knowledge into a tool intended to help organizations to master complexity and to assess organizational strategies in relation with mental patterns of management teams. This methodology was developed as a Eureka project with the participation of research teams in Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France. From 2003 to 2009, Muth was President of the Association of the Swiss Printing Industry. At this time she committed herself to reorient the printing industry to Sustainable Development providing the branch with analysis and concepts for survival in the context of globalization.Muth C., Bedeutet Globalisierung Krieg gegen die Schweizer Druckindustrie ?, in Druckmarkt 2004Muth C., Die graphische Industrie muss agiler werden - das gilt auch f√ºr ihre Verb√§nde, in Viscom-Zeitschrift 2006Muth.

Contributions to the changes in the Swiss universities system  In 1993, Muth was hired as a consultant to esig+ (Ecole Suisse d‚ÄôIng√©nieurs de l‚ÄôIndustrie Graphique et de l‚Äôemballage ‚Äì Swiss College of Engineering for the Printing and Packaging Industry). The School had the ambition to become the first College at University level to achieve an ISO 9001 quality certification. To do so a turnaround in the organization culture and in the teaching methods was necessary. Hence her blend of knowledge in neuroscience, learning biology, psychology, systems sciences and organization development was the perfect match. During the quality certification, esig+ became the main model for Rolf Dubs who was at this time the mentor of the Swiss Confederation for the development of the Universities of Applied Sciences. Muth was asked for extensive input about her futuristic vision of teaching and leading academic institutions. She participated as a member of the esig+ management staff in the whole process of development in Rolf Dubs‚Äô work group. Muth strongly advocated to include soft skills and social competence in academic curricula and to transform the teaching methods and relations between faculty and students accordingly. Many innovations in the academic context, like the possibility to do diploma or master thesis‚Äô in groups are due to her determination to challenge and oppose academic traditions. In 2000, esig+ was merged into HEIG-VD as department Comem+ (Communications Engineering Management) and Muth was asked to package the type of knowledge she used for the turnaround of esig+ in order to make it transmissible and teachable in a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).  Human Systems Engineering  In 1999 Muth received the assignment from the university to create a Master Program for extended education focused on intangible factors in organizations. She coined the term Human Systems Engineering and set up the first conceptual lineaments of the iter studiorum. Later, Prof. Marie-France Bourdais joined her to design, to promote the final version of the program and to run it with the first cohorts of students. HSE became quite popular and received a warm welcome from business and financial press.Bloch E. Entreprises: gros protentiels pour les biens intangibles, in AGEFI 04.07.2005,Baillod G., Le secret des processus humains, in Bilan, 1-2005 Later it was enriched with several specialization courses. After directing HSE until 2008, Muth organized her succession before her transition and handed the direction to her colleague Prof. Marie-France Bourdais.  Transition  Muth was aware of her gender dysphoria since her earliest childhood and attempted several times to transition without success; rigid values in her social, professional and family context, shame and fear prevented a coming out. Well informed psychological help was not available at this time, practitioners just felt uneasy being confronted with this type of request. As a first attempt to transition at the age of 32 Muth lived 4 months as a woman, but this attempt failed as she felt that her passing was not sufficient and there was no support nor perspective for a professional life as a trans woman. After a long period of bedridden sickness at the age of 57, she realized that there was no escape from facing her fate if she wanted to survive. In the meantime, an informed community had established on the Internet where she found the necessary information about how to handle her case, about knowledgeable practitioners and experienced surgeons. From the final decision to surgery only one year lapsed. Muth had her surgery with Dr. Preecha Tiewtranon in Bangkok before her social and professional coming out, which she did 4 months later. The whole process took place under the public eye, as Muth went on lecturing and facing her professional responsibilities. During her transition, Muth has been followed with the camera by Laurence P√©rigaud, a member of the Anthropology Institute of the University of Neuch√¢tel. Her documentary film was selected for the Swiss international festival Visions du r√©el. ¬´ Between Two Spirit - Becoming a Woman at Sixty ¬ª shows a successful transition as search of freedom and individuation as Jung intended it. Since her transition, Muth takes an active part in the debate around transgender issuesMuth C., Die Krankenkasse als Kostentreiberin, in Hausarzt Praxis 2010 and is an active member of the TGNS (TransGender Network Switzerland).  Societal Innovation  After her transition, Muth developed a new area of academic interest in societal innovation, arguing that too many ideas about how to solve societal issues are just discarded or forgotten because of conservative mindsets in business and politics. Hence she started the ‚ÄúHouses of ... Initiative‚Äù, intended to illuminate societal problems and demonstrate their solutions. On this basis she was asked to join the committee of the Project 2020 of Alliance F, the Central Swiss Women's Association. In the field of societal innovation, Muth has issued three thesis‚Äô:Dorier R, Muth C., Comment utiliser la complexit√© - Outils, attitudes et comp√©tences √† d√©velopper, jobindex media ag, 2010 * All business which fulfills three conditions (big business, well- documented knowledge taught in universities and well-established know-how documented sufficiently in quality systems) will leave the industrialized countries for the emerging countries. * The future of the presently industrialized countries depends on their innovation capacity and skills for managing complexity. * A de-globalization will take place sooner or later, depending on the capability of entire branches to switch to sustainability and to impose the respective rules and procedures as compulsory standards. Presently, at the HEIG-VD, Muth teaches these topics, works as adviser for politicians, writes and is active in research.  Home life  Muth lives as single in Yverdon-les-Bains, a thermal resort in the Canton Vaud.

Some software is designed to help foundations (known as \\"grantmakers\\") to organize, prioritize, and process the grant applications they receive from charities (known as \\"grantseekers\\"), as well as simplify oversight of the grants they make. Other software is designed to be used by grantseekers to help them organize and write their grant applications. Both types of software, as well as combined solutions serving both sets of users, are available as self-hosted programs or web-based cloud applications. The software functions for grantseekers can include grant discovery, budget planning, peer collaboration, regulatory compliance, proposal submission, administrative reporting and project tracking. Software functions for grantmakers can include receipt, organization, and prioritization of grant applications, fund disbursement tracking, grant recipient collaboration, and impact-of-funds analysis. In both cases, the software helps grant managers, principal investigators, researchers and other individuals ease grant-related administrative burdens.  Grant management software roles  A grant manager (or grant administrator) can be responsible for grant writing. regulatory compliance, identifying and managing grant project teams . Grant management software automates functions such as opportunity discovery, peer collaboration and workflow tracking. Additionally grants management software can streamline granting activities relating to confirming the tax-exempt status of a not-for- profit as well as cross checking applicants against various terrorist watch lists such as OFAC. Other software roles include applicants (both individuals and organizations), researchers, reviewers and any other party that may need to be involved in the grant making processes.  Software functions  The pre-award grad process encompasses everything done before a grant is awarded, such as searching for specific grant types open for application, writing and submitting the grant application, and receiving the rejection or denial letter from the potential grantor. The post-award process encompasses tasks after an award is won, such as purchasing research equipment, tracking and certifying research efforts, accounting tasks, and reporting to the grantor or grantors. Some software variants provide features for the entire lifecycle of a grant. Other solutions offer comprehensive and targeted services for the pre-award process. Others focus on the grant discovery part of the pre-award process, yet others offer some post-award services. More comprehensive solutions offer functionality that addresses all of the above aspects. Most grant management solutions are available as a hosted service. Under this model, customers pay vendors for online access to the software. Commonly called SaaS (software as a service) or a cloud service, hosted software is available as an application that is run at vendors‚Äô own facilities. One of the benefits of hosted software is that customers often need little or no internal IT support. Despite some concern over security, hosted services are usually more secure than nonprofits‚Äô own IT systems.  Grant management software market  Many nonprofits, schools and universities rely on grant funding. Each year, all U.S. grant sources give an estimated $1 trillion in grant money. The federal government alone spent $489 billion in grant funding in fiscal 2006. there is often confusion regarding the term Grant management in that many Grant managers control the disbursement of grant funds while other grant managers control the usage of received grant funds. this is an important distinction when deciding on the correct software for your organisation. Grant management software companies operate in the information-management market.  Grant discovery  Grant management software can help customers find grants by automatically searching known funding sources and alerting users when applicable grant opportunities are available. One site that grant discovery solutions can search is Grants.gov, which lists opportunities from 26 federal grant-making organizations. Other funding sources that can be included are foundations. There are hundreds of foundations in the United States, the top three being the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation and J. Paul Getty Trust, which have combined assets of $54.1 billion. In addition, some discovery solutions search for grants that are offered at the state level.  Grant collaboration  Preparing for award submissions, finding funding opportunities, and managing grant projects takes considerable collaboration.http://www.uams.edu/postdocsociety/grantsmanship_workshop_files/Tips%20for%20Applying%20to%20Private%20Foundations%20for%20Grant%20Money.pdf Some grant management software offer collaboration solutions to make this process easier. Collaboration solutions can help users review grant opportunities, vote on opportunities to apply for, and communicate with other project peers. A select few software vendors deploy social-media applications to simplify collaboration, which help limit the sometimes cumbersome serial communications process of emails. Increasingly, researchers and others involved in the grant process are adept in modern technologies such as social media.  Grant tracking and reporting  Organizations that receive funding often have to track grant-related activity and report results to grantors. These tasks can include creating and maintaining award documentation, preparing budgets, and ensuring fund use is within grantor compliance. The software can record who participates and manage grant-related documents such as letter templates as well as export data to programs such as Excel for easier reporting. In addition to reporting for internal purposes, organizations such as the Foundation Center allow grant makers to export their reports in order to provide analysis on grant making activity on both a micro and macro level  Grant management software tools  Grant management software is designed to facilitate best practice grants management and ensure transparency in managing government funded programs. The greatest challenge for these tools at present is to present detailed and strategic views of the performance indicators associated with the objectives of each grant funder.

The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo believe them to be children of women who disappeared during the Dirty War, and have requested samples for DNA profiling to compare with their database of victim families. Marcela and Felipe rejected the study. The administrations of both presidents N√©stor and Cristina Kirchner supported a compulsory blood collection in order to carry out the DNA profiling. The opposing parties and legal precedence, on the other hand, support the Nobles right to privacy. Development The case started in 2001, and two years later Marcela and Felipe agreed to compare their DNA with the two litigant families. Those families, however, delayed the execution of the ruling. In 2009, during the controversies between Clar√≠n and Kirchnerism, Marcela and Felipe agreed to a new study at the Forensic Medical Unit, but judge Conrado Bergesio ordered a search of their homes and the collection of personal clothing. Bergesio was replaced by Arroyo Salgado, who considered the evidence to be insufficient for a DNA profiling, and attempted to detain Marcela and Felipe at the street, break into Ernestina's house, and a compulsory collection of blood and spit. All opposing parties condemned the attitude towards the Noble Herrera. Salgado ruled as well that the collection should not be done by the Forensic Medical Unit, but by the National Bank of Genetic Databases, under control of the executive power. A 2011 ruling ordered again a compulsory collection of blood and spit, but not allowing to compare it with the more than 1,500 samples in the Grandmother's database, but just with a few specific families.

In August 2010, Metaswitch highlighted Phone Power as one of their first all IP customers and featured them in one of their first ‚ÄúBuilt On Metaswitch‚Äù promotional videos. In October 2010, Phone Power announced the acquisition of VOIP.com customers. The VOIP.com brand co- exists independently with the Phone Power brand. In August 2011, Innomedia announced a large purchase order of VoIP adapters from Phone Power. On May 2, 2012, Phone Power alerted customers that they were experiencing a Denial-of- service attack on their website. Service was temporarily interrupted to customers, but was fully restored that afternoon. They reported on their Twitter account that problem reported to FBI. In March 2014, Obihai Technology advised clients using Obihai analog telephone adapters with Google Voice that they should switch to rival vendors Phone Power or Anveo under the OBiTALK Approved Service Provider Programhttp://blog.obihai.com/2014/03/obihai- announces-obitalk-approved_18.html as Google's removal of XMPP support would disrupt use of their ATA with that service.https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/obihai-offers-new-low-cost-home- phone-options-as-technology-change-at-google-ends-free-service/ Official Obihai support for Google Voice returned September 11, 2014.http://blog.obihai.com/2014/09/google-voice-and-obihai-update.html Products In 2009, Phone Power introduced ‚Äúfree 60 minutes of international calling‚Äù to select destinations on any plan that offered 3,000 minutes or more. In 2010, Phone Power introduced the Global Plus Add On plan for international calling. This allowed an additional 1200 minutes to those same countries. In January 2011, Phone Power launched its free iPhone App, allowing customers to use the included international calling on their mobile phones. The company also offered a ‚ÄúZippy‚Äù USB adapter which could be used in addition to the home adapter, allowing use of the service while traveling (The \\"Zippy\\" USB adapter has since been discontinued). The \\"Zippy\\" USB adapter was replaced with a stand-alone Softphone that can be used from any Windows or Apple computer with a microphone and speakers. The softphone is a free download. VoIP requirements For home use, customers use a ‚ÄúPhone Power‚Äù ‚ÄúVoIP router‚Äù (or their own supplied hardware) that connects to their main router or broadband modem. An upload speed of 128 Kbps and a download speed of 768 kbit/s is the minimum requirement for reliable quality of service without sub- standard call quality. Telephone number availability and portability Subscribers select a number in the U.S. for their primary line, in an area code unrelated to their actual residence. Subscribers can obtain additional ‚Äúvirtual numbers‚Äù for a monthly fee. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's local number portability, not every phone number is available in every area code. Residents of the U.S. and Canada may subscribe to Phone Power by credit card, debit card, or pre-paid credit card. Emergency calls One difference between a Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), and Voice Over IP is the way they are registered for 9-1-1 Emergency Services. With POTS, the telephone number is forever associated with a single address and that address is registered with the appropriate regional 9-1-1 database. Voice Over IP allows more mobility than POTS, since your number can be tied to a small piece of hardware or software that can travel from place to place. This mobility is addressed with E911, or Enhanced 9-1-1. Phone Power allows the customer to change their address for 9-1-1 over the internet, allowing for near instantaneous updating of the regional 9-1-1 database. Phone Power does have a Failsafe Number Feature that will forward incoming calls to the Phone Power number to an alternate number in the event their system cannot send those calls to the Phone Power device.

The myth was first published using tablet CBS 8317, translated by George Aaron Barton in 1918 as \\"Sumerian religious texts\\" in \\"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\\", number ten, entitled \\"An excerpt from an exorcism\\". The tablet is at its thickest point. A larger fragment of the text was found on CBS tablet number 14152 and first published by Henry Frederick Lutz as \\"A hymn and incantation to Enlil\\" in \\"Selected Sumerian and Babylonian Texts\\", number 114 in 1919. Barton's tablet had only containted lines five to twenty four of the reverse of Lutz's, which had already been translated in 1918 and was used to complete several of his damaged lines. Edward Chiera published tablet CBS 7924B from the hymn in \\"Sumerian Epics and Myths\\".

More were found at Henri de Genouillac's excavations at Kish (C 53). Another tablet of the myth (Si 231) was excavated at Sippar in the collections of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.Falkenstein, Adam., Sumerische G√∂tterlieder (Volume 1 of 2): Abhandlungen der Heidelberg Akademie der Wissenschaften - philosophisch-historische Klasse Jahrgang 1959, 1, 1, pl. 1f, 2f and 4, Abhandlung, Carl Winter Universit√§tsverlag, 1959. Sir Charles Leonard Woolley unearthed more tablets at Ur contained in the \\"Ur excavations texts\\" from 1928. Other tablets and versions were used to bring the myth to its present form with the latest translations presented by Thorkild Jacobsen, Miguel Civil and Joachim Krecher. Composition The hymn, noted by Kramer as one of the most important of its type, starts with praise for Enlil in his awe-inspiring dais: The hymn develops by relating Enlil founding and creating the origin of the city of Nippur and his organization of the earth. In contrast to the myth of Enlil and Ninlil where the city exists before creation, here Enlil is shown to be responsible for its planning and construction, suggesting he surveyed and drew the plans before its creation: The hymn moves on from the physical construction of the city and gives a description and veneration of its ethics and moral code: The last sentence has been compared by R. P. Gordon to the description of Jerusalem in the Book of Isaiah (), \\"the city of justice, righteousness dwelled in her\\" and in the Book of Jeremiah (), \\"O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.\\" The myth continues with the city's inhabitants building a temple dedicated to Enlil, referred to as the Ekur. The priestly positions and responsibilities of the Ekur are listed along with an appeal for Enlil's blessings on the city, where he is regarded as the source of all prosperity: A similar passage to the last lines above has been noted in the Biblical Psalms () \\"The voice of the Lord makes hinds to calve and makes goats to give birth (too) quickly\\". The hymn concludes with further reference to Enlil as a farmer and praise for his wife, Ninlil: Andrew R. George suggested that the hymn to Enlil \\"can be incorporated into longer compositions\\" as with the Kesh temple hymn and \\"the hymn to temples in Ur that introduces a Shulgi hymn.\\" Discussion The poetic form and laudatory content of the hymn have shown similarities to the Book of Psalms in the Bible, particularly Psalm 23 () \\"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures.\\" Line eighty four mentions: and in line ninety one, Enlil is referred to as a shepherd: The shepherd motif originating in this myth is also found describing Jesus in the Book of John (). Joan Westenholz noted that \\"The farmer image was even more popular than the shepherd in the earliest personal names, as might be expected in an agrarian society.\\" She notes that both Falkenstein and Thorkild Jacobsen consider the farmer refers to the king of Nippur; Reisman has suggested that the farmer or 'engar' of the Ekur was likely to be Ninurta. The term appears in line sixty Wayne Horowitz discusses the use of the word abzu, normally used as a name for an abzu temple, god, cosmic place or cultic water basin. In the hymn to Enlil, its interior is described as a 'distant sea': The foundations of Enlil's temple are made of lapis lazuli, which has been linked to the \\"soham\\" stone used in the Book of Ezekiel () describing the materials used in the building of \\"Eden, the Garden of god\\" perched on \\"the mountain of the lord\\", Zion, and in the Book of Job () \\"The stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold\\". Moses also saw God's feet standing on a \\"paved work of a sapphire stone\\" in (). Precious stones are also later repeated in a similar context describing decoration of the walls of New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse (). Along with the Kesh Temple Hymn, Steve Tinney has identified the Hymn to Enlil as part of a standard sequence of scribal training scripts he refers to as the Decad. He suggested that \\"the Decad constituted a required program of literary learning, used almost without exception throughout Babylonia. The Decad thus included almost all literary types available in Sumerian.\\"Tinney, Steve., On the Curricular Setting of Sumerian Literature, Iraq 61: 159-172.

Storm background Around 3:30 in the afternoon (Eastern Daylight Time) on May 29, 1995, scattered thunderstorms developed over the Western Catskill Mountains of New York. Over the next few hours the storms moved east, only producing isolated wind and hail. One particular thunderstorm exploded into a supercell upon crossing the Hudson River Valley, due to the presence of higher dew points flowing up the valley from the south and locally enhanced low-level shear. A tornado touched down in Columbia County at 6:40 p.m., producing F2 damage. The tornado lifted off the ground twenty minutes later and the storm moved over the mountains along the New York/Massachusetts border. Shortly after crossing into Massachusetts, the storm dropped the violent Great Barrington, Massachusetts tornado. The tornado and destruction The tornado itself touched down around 7:06 p.m. in Great Barrington near the Walter J. Koladza Airport. Near the town line with Monterey, a car was lifted off of Route 23, and tossed into a wooded area. Over one hundred homes and businesses were either damaged or destroyed, including the grandstand at the Great Barrington Fairgrounds. Additionally, twenty-four people (or twenty-seven according to a different source) were injured. The tornado went for a length of and eventually ended near the town of Monterey. The storm itself caused $25 million worth of damage. Three people were killed‚Äîtwo students and a staff member at the private Eagleton School‚Äîas they were returning to the campus in Great Barrington. The F4 rating is based entirely on the car that was thrown 1,000 feet. The worst structural damage from this tornado was in the F3 range. The rating of the tornado is sometimes disputed because of this.

In 1954 he was promoted to Director of Research of the Marconi Company, and became then in 1962 Research Director of the English Electric Group. In 1967 he presented the Bernard Price Memorial Lecture and was elected President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1972. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 and delivered their first Clifford Paterson lecture in 1976 on the subject of radar. Eastwood was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1962 and knighted in 1973. He also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1977.

Biography  He started playing guitar in 1961, then started the bass guitar in 1964. Not knowing how to read music, he taught himself by listening to records. He was influenced by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and other rock bands of the 60s. In 1964, he bought his first bass, a replica of Paul McCartney's bass. In 1967, like many artists, he passed through Club Med as a musician. He moved to Nantes in 1969, where he played in local bands with musicians such as Jacky Mascarel, and Philippe Grandvoinet (New Direction). While there, he founded the group Nantais Zig-Zag with Jean-Luc Chevalier (Tri Yann). He also played in the Crystal Group. In 1977, along with Mascarel, Le P√©ron got to know bassists Laurent Voulzy and Alain Souchon. He went on to record \\"C≈ìur Grenadine\\" and \\"Bopper en larmes\\" with Voulzy, in 1979 and 1983. In 1983 he made \\"Olympia 83\\" with Souchon and Jacky Mascarel. It was during that year, 1983, that he crossed paths with Jean-Jacques Goldman, during the \\"Champs √âlys√©es\\" show.Patrick Amine Jean-Jacques Goldman: un monde √† part 2007 Page 15 \\"Et √† ce moment-l√†, Jean-Jacques rencontre pendant une √©mission de Drucker, Claude Le P√©ron.

This led him to add Le P√©ron to his band.Rencontre avec Claude Le Peron He and other Goldman band members worked with Michael Jones, drummer Jean-Fran√ßois Gautier and the Rhinos.Jean-Fran√ßois Gautier (interview with drummer with the Rhinos) \\"J'ai choisi de venir avec Michael Jones, c'est un chanteur tr√®s sympa et connu du grand public gr√¢ce √† sa pr√©sence aux cot√©s de Jean-Jacques Goldman.

Her seminal work, Folklore of Herefordshire published in 1912 has been recognized as an authoritative \\"model of scientific scholarship\\". Amongst her other works is a collaboration with Ralph Vaughan Williams, Twelve Traditional Carols from Herefordshire, and various notes to the journal of The Folklore Society. Early life Ella Mary Smith was born 26 March 1874 in the hamlet of Bidney, in Dilwyn parish, Herefordshire, England to Mary Ann (n√©e Griffiths) and James Smith, a farmer. After attending Clyde House School, she completed her schooling at Hereford High School for Girls. Smith married a soliciter, Francis Leather, in 1893 and the two moved to the town of Weobley, where their three sons, John Francis, Geoffrey and Godfrey were born. Career When Leather first became interested in collecting folklore is unknown, but by 1904 her private journals indicate that she had already compiled networks of collaborators with whom she was working to gather folk songs of the area. A local author, Reverend Compton Reade asked her to contribute a chapter, \\"The Folk-Lore of the Shire\\" to his book Memorials of Old Herefordshire published in that year. In 1905, she joined both the Folk-Lore and the Folk-Song Societies. As her skill with music was rudimentary, she had difficulty providing transcriptions of tunes until 1906, when she was put in contact with composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. Williams secured for Leather a phonograph which had the ability to record and reproduce sound. By 1907, her reputation as an authority on folk lore was firmly established, when she published a selection of folk tales in the inaugural issue of Herefordshire Magazine. Leather worked with Cecil Sharp in making wax cylinder recordings. One of his recordings occurred in December 1909, when Leather took him to see Morris dancers on Boxing day in Brimfield. She copied down the dance steps to accompany the recording and on the same trip, introduced Sharp to local fiddlers John Lock and William Preece, who were also recorded by the duo. Sharp found using the new technology to record folk tunes impracticable, but Leather is thought to have recorded close to thirty songs on multiple cylinders between 1907 and 1913 and possibly a dozen more. Leather's seminal work, Folklore of Herefordshire published in 1912, has been recognized as authoritative and was reprinted numerous times through 1990. It contained contained lyrics and music notations for 23 ballads, carols, and songs and was fully referenced with extensive notes on sources and people who were consulted on the materials. That year, she introduced Williams to several local traveller encampments and he collected the song, \\"The Unquiet Grave\\" from tenor Alfred Price Jones. The two would collaborate in 1920 on Twelve Traditional Carols from Herefordshire. In 1913, Leather put aside her collecting and began working as the Commandant of the Red Cross volunteers stationed at Sarnesfield Court Hospital. For the duration of the war, she invested her time to war activities. Her son, John Francis, died in France in 1918. When the war ended, much of her time was devoted to other endeavors. She was a sought-after speaker for antiquarian societies and worked with the Women's Institute. In 1925 she published Collecting Folk-Melodies from Gypsies in Herefordshire, which was based on material she had collected between 1908 and 1912. That same year she was a co-founder of the Herefordshire chapter of the English Folk Dance Society. In 1926, Leather published \\"The Timber Houses of Weobley\\" in the Woolhope Naturalists Club's journal Transactions. That year, a dance she had collected, \\"Haste to the Wedding\\" was performed at the Royal Albert Hall in the first National Festival of Folk Dance. Intent on saving Weobley's old grammar school, she purchased the 17th-century building, using it as a private study. She also published a guide to the parish church and began work on the History of Weobley, but she did not complete it prior to her death. In 1928, she served as president of the Herefordshire Women's Institute. Death and legacy Leather died suddenly from a heart attack on 7 June 1928 and was buried at the Weobley Cemetery. She is remembered for her collaborations with Sharp and Williams, but also for her original work in collecting folk songs and dances from Herefordshire. \\"Leather made more phonograph recordings than any of the other collectors associated with the Folk-Song Society\\", though songs that she discovered often were credited to her collaborators. Her papers are housed in the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library of London.

Biography  = Family and Education = Robert Fossier was born into Catholicism. His father, a soldier who served in World War I, was angered by the Munich Agreement. His mother, a piano teacher, encouraged an interest in history and fiction. He did his secondary education in Paris, first at the lyc√©e Janson-de-Sailly, then at the lyc√©e Henri-IV, where he prepped for the entrance exam of the √âcole des chartes. He graduated with a thesis on The economic life of the abbey of Clairvaux, from its beginning to the sixteenth century (1949), and passed the teaching exam (agr√©gation) in history.  University career  Robert Fossier began his career as an archivist in the historical library of Paris (1949‚Äì1953). He then became a teacher at the lyc√©e de Fontainebleau (1953‚Äì1955), then at the lyc√©e Carnot in Paris (1955‚Äì1957). In 1957, he became assistant at the Sorbonne, then charg√© de cours at Nancy II university from 1961. Ten years later, he became professor at the Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on- Sorbonne, where he was several times chair of the history department, and then in 1993, professor emeritus. In 1971, he received the CNRS Silver medal. He was president of the Soci√©t√© de l'√âcole des chartes from 1990 to 1991. He died on May 25, 2012, at Meudon.  Historian of the Middle Ages  As one of the spiritual successors of Marc Bloch and the √âcole des Annales (in his work on society and economics rather than religion and culture), Robert Fossier dealt almost exclusively with the rural societies of northwestern Europe, from Charlemagne to the Hundred Years' War. In 1968, he published his doctoral thesis entitled La Terre et les hommes en Picardie jusqu‚Äô√† la fin du XIIIe si√®cle (The Land and People of Picardy to the End of the 13th Century). In the 1970s, he began to focus his research and publications on the peasantry and feudalism (a term he refuses to use) between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. He is the inventor of the concept of encellulement, which expands on Pierre Toubert's concept of incastellamento. According to Robert Fossier, the grouping of the village in the north of the French kingdom was due not only to incastellamento, but rather to lordly initiative in general. In his latest book, Ces gens du Moyen Age (translated as The Axe and the Oath: Ordinary Life in the Middle Ages), Robert Fossier deemphasises the aspect of medieval society which we are most familiar, the aristocracy, in order to concentrate on that less spoken-of aspect, the people. In his own words of summary, \\"I am persuaded that medieval man is us\\".Emily A. Winkler \\"Quest for the Common Man\\", review of The Axe and the Oath: Ordinary Life in the Middle Ages, Oxonian Review, 31 May 2011 The works of Robert Fossier have gained considerable fame (including at least 37 translations in North and South America, Japan, Germany, and Great Britain).

History Restaurant automation means the use of a restaurant management system to automate the major operations of a restaurant establishment. Even in the early 1970s a number of restaurants served food solely through vending machines. These restaurants were called automats or, in Japan, shokkenki. Customers ordered their food directly through the machines. As of 2011, across Europe, McDonald's had already begun implementing 7,000 touch screen kiosks that could handle cashiering duties. More recently, restaurants are opening that have completely or partially automated their services. These may include: taking orders, preparing food, serving, and billing. A few fully automated restaurants operate without any human intervention whatsoever. Robots are designed to help and sometimes replace human labour (such as waiters and chefs).

Gilbert, written by Gil Lasky and starring Gloria Grahame, Melody Patterson, Len Lesser, and Milton Selzer. The film follows an orphaned teenager (Patterson) who arrives at a remote orphanage run by a madwoman (Grahame) and her handyman, both sadists and child murderers. Shot in Los Angeles in 1970 and released theatrically in 1971, Blood and Lace became a frequent billing on the drive-in theater circuit throughout the 1970s. At the time, it was considered to be one of the most gratuitous films to receive a GP rating. It has been cited as a \\"proto-slasher film.\\" Plot Teenager Ellie Masters is orphaned after her prostitute mother and one of her johns are clobbered with a hammer, and the house set on fire. Calvin Carruthers, a detective investigating Ellie's mother's murder, takes an avid interest in her well- being. Ellie is sent to an isolated orphanage run by the sadistic Mrs. Deere, and her handyman, Tom Kredge. The day before Ellie arrives, one of the orphans, Ernest, attempts to escape, and is chased by Kredge, who cuts off his hand and leaves him to bleed to death. After arriving at the orphanage, Ellie soon finds that Mrs. Deere runs it like a workhouse, and the children are forced to complete incessant physical tasks while she and Kredge split the monthly welfare checks. Harold Mullins, a social worker responsible for overseeing the orphanage, is easily swayed by Mrs. Deere and overlooks inconsistencies he observes in the house. Before Mullins arrives to inspect the orphanage and complete a head count, Mrs. Deere and Kredge retrieve the bodies of several deceased orphans from a basement freezer, and pose them in beds in the infirmary to appear as though they are ill. Also stored in the freezer is the body of Mrs. Deere's dead husband, whom she occasionally speaks to as though he is alive. Carruthers visits Ellie at the orphanage, and she confides to him that Mrs. Deere and Kredge are exploiting the children. Meanwhile, Ellie's roommate, a teenaged girl named Bunch, grows jealous as Ellie competes for the affection Walter, a 21-year-old who helps Mrs. Deere around the house. Ellie is disturbed when she finds Jennifer, one of the orphans, has been tied up in the attic for days on end after attempting to run away; Ellie tries to give Jennifer water, but is stopped by Kredge. Ellie soon makes a plan to run away herself and find her biological father. Kredge agrees to help Ellie run away under false pretenses, and attempts to sexually assault her when she meets him in the basement; Mrs. Deere, however, stops the rape attempt. Ellie confronts Mrs. Deere about Jennifer, and expresses concern that she might die. Mrs. Deere explains calmly that even if Jennifer should die, that advancements in medical science will soon allow the dead to be revived anyway. That night, Ellie awakens to a masked figure standing over her bed with a hammer, but Mrs. Deere assures her it was only a nightmare. The next morning, Ellie attempts to run away after finding Walter in bed with Bunch; she retrieves a suitcase, but upon opening it finds Ernest's severed hand. She screams in terror and attempts to flee, but Kredge locks her in the basement freezer. Pete, one of the orphans, witnesses this and attempts to warn the others. Mullins arrives at the house to inquire about the missing children and threatens to involve the police, prompting Kredge and Mrs. Deere to murder him and bring his body to the freezer. In the basement, the masked figure appears and attacks Kredge, killing him. Ellie manages to escape in the melee, and the masked figure chases her into the woods. Mrs. Deere drags Kredge's body into the freezer, but is locked inside by Jennifer, who has been freed from the attic. In the woods, Ellie finds Ernest's corpse before being confronted by the masked figure in a clearing, who reveals himself as Detective Carruthers. He explains that he knows Ellie killed her mother, and that his suspicions of Mrs. Deere and Kredge led him to try and drive Ellie to run away in order to observe how Mrs. Deere would respond. Carruthers reveals he is romantically interested in Ellie, and uses his knowledge of her crime to blackmail her into marrying him. After she agrees, Carruthers admits to Ellie that her mother lost her virginity to him. Realizing she's agreed to marry her father, Ellie laughs hysterically. Cast Production Blood and Lace was shot in 1970 in Los Angeles, California on a budget of $200,000 with the exterior forest scenes being shot in Runyon Canyon, which at the time was private property. The house featured in the film as the Deere Orphanage was empty at the time of filming. Star Melody Patterson was quoted as saying the production was enjoyable, as well as lauding Gloria Grahame's presence on-set. Given the film's minuscule budget, the filmmakers utilized music and sound effects from free library archives, resulting in compositions and sonic elements reminiscent of 1950s and '60s horror and monster movies. The film bore the working title The Blood Secret, which appears on the original print of the film. It was, however, changed to Blood and Lace upon its theatrical release. Release Blood and Lace was released on March 17, 1971 in the United States, and became a regular at drive-in theaters on double bills with other horror films. It was paired with such films as Curse of the Crimson Altar (1968), Horror House (1970), Count Yorga, Vampire (1970), House of Dark Shadows (1970), Circus of Horrors (1960), and Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971). Many drive-ins also screened the film alongside an array of Vincent Price films. =Reception= Upon its release, Blood and Lace was considered to be one of the \\"sickest\\" films to receive a GP rating (precursor to the PG rating), which allowed audience members of all ages to attend. This was attributed to the film's exhibition of graphic murder scenes, namely the clawhammer murder scene at the beginning of the film. In retrospect, Melody Patterson said that she had \\"never considered the film that gory because the effects were so bad. Even Vic Tayback's mask that he wears running around was phony looking.\\" The film received mostly negative critical reception. The New York Times said of the film: \\"There's a good deal of blood and a minimum of logic, or lace for that matter, in \\"Blood and Lace,\\" which was exposed in local theaters yesterday, to illustrate, we assume, that horror can be both vague and silly... [it is] a low-grade exercise in shadows, screams, traumas and slayings that are largely more laughable than shocking.\\" The New York Post said: \\"The story manages to keep you guessing all the way to its macabre end, if you can stand it that long.\\" Ann Guarino of The New York Daily News said \\"The cast tries to bring believability to the plot, but the audience couldn't help laughing in the wrong places.\\" The Motion Picture Guide gave the film a middling review, stating that it \\"manage to keep some tension despite murky photography and muddy sound.\\" A review published in Variety was also middling, noting: \\"Director Gilbert settles for fast pace to cover actors' inadequacies, [and] does manage to work up [a] nail-chewer climax... Miss Grahame makes some brave stabs at cutting through the silliness, but eventually succumbs to the uneven style of acting supplied by the remaining cast members.\\"Quoted in Shelley 2009, p. 192. Home media Blood and Lace did not receive a home media release in the United States on either VHS or DVD. The film received a Blu-ray release from Shout! Factory on November 24, 2015, marking the film's first North American home media release in history. Significance Although largely decried by critics upon its release, Blood and Lace developed a cult following through its presence as a regular drive-in bill as well as through television syndication in the late 1970s. The film's opening scene, which features a POV shot of the killer wielding a hammer while ascending the stairs and entering a bedroom has been oft compared to the opening shot of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). Fangoria has credited the film as being one of the first American \\"proto-slasher films,\\" predating Halloween, Black Christmas (1974), and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).

He was head of the sculpture department at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1925 and professor of sculpture there from 1949 to 1968, where he taught a number of well-known sculptors. Early life Gerrard was born on 7 May 1899 in Hartford, Cheshire where his family had been farming for four centuries. He was the youngest of five children and was directly descended from the 16th century herbalist John Gerard. Gerrard was educated at Northwich Technical School which he left in 1916. During the First World War, he served in the army with the Cameron Highlanders, the Black Watch and the Gordon Highlanders and in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) from 1917. In the RFC, Gerrard flew Farman MF.11s and F.E.2Bs as a night bomber pilot, crashing and injuring his back on one occasion when his undercarriage fell off. Career Memorial Stone for a Hunter, 1926 After being demobilized Gerrard studied at the Manchester School of Art in 1919 and at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1920 where Henry Tonks was his teacher and contemporaries included Samuel Rabinovitch. In 1925, Tonks appointed Gerrard head of the school's sculpture department, a position he held until 1948 after which he was Professor of Sculpture until 1968 and then Emeritus Professor. In the 1920s, Gerrard elected to wear a standard set of clothes - sports jacket, corduroy trousers, a collarless shirt and a yellow stock. He bought multiple copies of these items and wore them regularly for decades. Carving over entrance to St Anselm's church, Kennington Cross, 1933 During the Second World War, Gerrard was a Staff Captain attached to the Royal Engineers working on camouflage projects. Following a plane crash in which he was badly injured, he almost had an arm amputated, but persuaded his doctors to save it so that he could continue sculpting. In a long teaching career, Gerrard taught and influenced numerous artists, among them Kenneth Armitage, Karin Jonzen, Eduardo Paolozzi and F. E. McWilliam. In the austerity years after the Second World War, Gerrard kept the school supplied with raw materials for sculpting by salvaging stone, wood and metal from bomb sites. Well respected for his expertise as a teacher and his generosity, many of his former students would visit him at his home in Kent where he continued sculpting into his eighties. Whilst teaching at the Slade, Gerrard received private sculpture commissions, often executed on a large scale in stone, as well as producing murals for ocean liners. He also worked as a book illustrator with his future wife Katherine Leigh- Pemberton, producing wood cuts for Elephants and Ethnologists (by Grafton Elliot Smith) and Egyptian Mummies (by Smith and Warren Royal Dawson) in 1924 and for the Book of Bath in 1925. During 1944-45 he worked as a war artist. Among his sculptural works are: *Memorial Stone for a Hunter, 1926. Displayed temporarily at the Tate Gallery before its final installation. *North Wind, 1928-29\\\\. One of eight personifications of the four winds commissioned by Charles Holden and Frank Pick for the headquarters of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London at 55 Broadway. *St Anselm, 1933, St Anselm's church, Kennington Cross. *Monumental Parcel, gilded carved wooden panels of horses in a forest for RMS Britannic. *Stages in the Development of Man, 1955, four wall panels built into the end fa√ßade of a building in Hemel Hempstead. *The Dance, 1960, a sculpture wall for which he was awarded the Royal British Society of Sculptors' Silver medal. An exhibition of his work was staged at the South London Art Gallery in 1978. Collections that contain work by Gerrard include the Tate Gallery, and the Imperial War Museum. The Henry Moore Institute archive contains works by Gerrard and his papers. Family Gerrard married three times: #1933, Katherine Leigh-Pemberton (died 1970) #1972, Nancy Sinclair (died 1995) #1995, Karen Sinclair He had no children.

It was developed by combining meshfree methodsLiu, G.R. 2nd edn: 2009 Mesh Free Methods, CRC Press. 978-1-4200-8209-9 with the finite element method. S-FEM are applicable to solid mechanics as well as fluid dynamics problems, although so far they have mainly been applied to the former. Description The essential idea in the S-FEM is to use a finite element mesh (in particular triangular mesh) to construct numerical models of good performance. This is achieved by modifying the compatible strain field, or construct a strain field using only the displacements, hoping a Galerkin model using the modified/constructed strain field can deliver some good properties. Such a modification/construction can be performed within elements but more often beyond the elements (meshfree concepts): bring in the information from the neighboring elements. Naturally, the strain field has to satisfy certain conditions, and the standard Galerkin weak form needs to be modified accordingly to ensure the stability and convergence. A comprehensive review of S-FEM covering both methodology and applications can be found inW. Zeng, G.R. Liu. Smoothed finite element methods (S-FEM): An overview and recent developments. Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 2016, doi: 10.1007/s11831-016-9202-3 (\\"Smoothed Finite Element Methods (S-FEM): An Overview and Recent Developments\\"). History The development of S-FEM started from the works on meshfree methods, where the so-called weakened weak (W2) formulation based on the G space theoryG.R. Liu. A G space theory and a weakened weak (W2) form for a unified formulation of compatible and incompatible methods: Part I theory and Part II applications to solid mechanics problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 81: 1093-1126, 2010 were developed. The W2 formulation offers possibilities for formulate various (uniformly) \\"soft\\" models that works well with triangular meshes. Because triangular mesh can be generated automatically, it becomes much easier in re-meshing and hence automation in modeling and simulation. In addition, W2 models can be made soft enough (in uniform fashion) to produce upper bound solutions (for force-driving problems). Together with stiff models (such as the fully compatible FEM models), one can conveniently bound the solution from both sides. This allows easy error estimation for generally complicated problems, as long as a triangular mesh can be generated. Typical W2 models are the Smoothed Point Interpolation Methods (or S-PIM).Liu, G.R. 2nd edn: 2009 Mesh Free Methods, CRC Press. 978-1-4200-8209-9 The S-PIM can be node-based (known as NS-PIM or LC-PIM),Liu GR, Zhang GY, Dai KY, Wang YY, Zhong ZH, Li GY and Han X, A linearly conforming point interpolation method (LC-PIM) for 2D solid mechanics problems, International Journal of Computational Methods, 2(4): 645-665, 2005. edge-based (ES-PIM),G.R.

A normed G space and weakened weak (W2) formulation of a cell-based Smoothed Point Interpolation Method. International Journal of Computational Methods, 6(1): 147-179, 2009 The NS-PIM was developed using the so-called SCNI technique.Chen, J. S., Wu, C. T., Yoon, S. and You, Y. (2001). A stabilized conforming nodal integration for Galerkin mesh-free methods. Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 50: 435‚Äì466. It was then discovered that NS-PIM is capable of producing upper bound solution and volumetric locking free.G. R. Liu and G. Y. Zhang. Upper bound solution to elasticity problems: A unique property of the linearly conforming point interpolation method (LC-PIM). International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 74: 1128-1161, 2008. The ES-PIM is found superior in accuracy, and CS-PIM behaves in between the NS-PIM and ES-PIM. Moreover, W2 formulations allow the use of polynomial and radial basis functions in the creation of shape functions (it accommodates the discontinuous displacement functions, as long as it is in G1 space), which opens further rooms for future developments. The S-FEM is largely the linear version of S-PIM, but with most of the properties of the S-PIM and much simpler. It has also variations of NS-FEM, ES-FEM and CS-FEM. The major property of S-PIM can be found also in S-FEM.Zhang ZQ, Liu GR, Upper and lower bounds for natural frequencies: A property of the smoothed finite element methods, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Vol. 84 Issue: 2, 149-178, 2010 List of S-FEM models * Node-based Smoothed FEM (NS-FEM)Liu GR, Nguyen-Thoi T, Nguyen-Xuan H, Lam KY (2009) A node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM) for upper bound solutions to solid mechanics problems.

These comics have ranged from being based on The Real Ghostbusters animated series, to the 1984 film. The Real Ghostbusters The very first comic book addition to the Ghostbusters franchise was The Real Ghostbusters. It was a comic series based on the animated series of the same name. NOW Comics and Marvel Comics shared the comic book rights to the property. NOW Comics had the rights for publication in North America, while Marvel had the rights in Europe. Marvel published the series in Europe through their Marvel UK imprint. Some of the Marvel UK issues reprinted material from the NOW Comics series, and vice versa. Publication of the series began on March 28, 1988. =NOW Comics= NOW Comics began their series in August 1988. The series ran for two volumes, two annuals and one special. The first volume ran for 28 issues. The series was primarily written by James Van Hise, with the exceptions being issue 4 by La Morris Richmond and issue 21 which featured Marvel UK reprints due to production delays. John Tobias, Phillip Hester, Evan Dorkin and Howard Bender were among the pencilers for the series. The series was on hiatus for a time due to the publisher's financial difficulties, but was subsequently re-launched. The second volume ran for four issues, one special (The Real Ghostbusters Spectacular 3-D Special) and two annuals (one regular and one 3-D). The series had a main story that ran from the 3-D Special through issue 4, followed by back-up stories reprinted from the Marvel UK run. They also contained game pages and health tips for kids and parents. Several issues of volume 1 and the main issues of volume 2 used covers taken from the Marvel UK run. NOW Comics also published a 3 issue miniseries in 1989 called Real Ghostbusters Starring in Ghostbusters II that was collected as a trade paperback. A spin-off series of the popular Ghostbusters character Slimer was also published. NOW Comics published a series that ran 19 issues from 1989 through 1990, as well as spawning a one shot special called The Real Ghostbusters 3-D Slimer Special. Some of these issues were reprinted as a tradepaperback in 1991. When IDW Publishing licensed the comic book rights to the Ghostbusters property, they began to reprint the Now Comics series in a multi-volume series of trade-paperbacks called The Real Ghostbusters Omnibus. beginning in October 2012. =Marvel UK= Marvel UK published a magazine- sized comic for 193 issues that also spawned 4 annuals and 10 specials. The series started its run on March 28, 1988, starting five months before the NOW Comics series. Each issue contained three to four comic stories, a prose story alternating from a regular tale to one narrated by Winston Zeddemore, a prose entry of Egon Spengler‚Äôs Spirit Guide typically discussing the entities in the comic, a bio of a character or ghost that appeared in the series, and a short Slimer strip. The comics featured a rotating line-up of creators, including John Carnell, Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, Brian Williamson, Anthony Williams, Stuart Place, Richard Starkings, and Helen Stone. The series ran weekly and eventually began to feature reprints from the American comics as well as stories that appeared previously in the series. The American comics were often broken up into four to five parts, and incorporated the failed Slimer! series beginning with issue 121. The last original story ran in issue 171 with the remaining issues being reprints from the earlier comics and the American books. Four annual comics were produced in a hardcover format. Each book contained several comic strips, full-page Slimer strips, and prose stories. The books also included game and activity pages, and reprints of bios found in the regular books. Some of these issues were collected by Titan Books into trade paperbacks. These include: * A Hard Day's Fright (collects The Real Ghostbusters #1‚Äì7, 9, 11, 19, 50 and 99, 96 pages, October 2005, Titan Books, ) * Who You Gonna Call? (collects The Real Ghostbusters #12, 16, 19, 24, 33, 48, 52 and 53, 1989 Annual, 1990 Annual, 1992 Annual, 96 pages, April 2006, Titan Books, ) * Which Witch Is Which? (96 pages, July 2006, Titan Books, ) * This Ghost Is Toast! (96 pages, November 2006, Titan Books, ) Marvel UK also reprinted NOW Comics' tradepaperback Real Ghostbusters Starring in Ghostbusters II in 1989 as well as reprinting various issues as a compendium called The Real Ghostbusters: The Giggling Ghoul and Other Stories also in 1989. Outside of the ongoing title, the Ghostbusters were also featured in the 30 issue run of The Marvel Bumper Comic. An anthology style comic that was published by Marvel UK from 1988‚Äì1989, and that featured strips adapting different characters and properties. Like Now Comics, Marvel UK also published a 19 issue series revolving around Slimer. =Welsh Publishing Group= The publishing company Welsh Publishing Group Inc published The Real Ghostbusters Magazine. A 7 issue magazine that ran from 1989 to 1991 and reprinted a few of the issues from both the NOW Comics and Marvel UK comic series. 88MPH Studios Over ten years after the end of The Real Ghostbusters comic books, the property returned to comics courtesy of the Quebec-based comic company 88MPH Studios. 88MPH published a 4 issue mini-series titled Ghostbusters: Legion that ran from February through May 2004. It was written by Andrew Dabb with pencils by Steve Kurth and inks by Serge LaPointe. Unlike the previous comics, this title (as well as future titles by other publishing companies) would be presenting the characters the way they were portrayed in the original 1984 film but set in 2004 instead of 1984, more serious themed and less cartoonish than The Real Ghostbusters series. The storyline of Legion saw the return of the four Ghostbusters and the principal cast from the movie. Set six months on from the Gozer incident (in this universe having occurred in 2004) the series was designed to follow the Ghostbusters as their initial fame faded and they returned to the regular chore of busting ghosts on a daily basis. The series sees the team run ragged as a spate of supernatural crimes and other related occurrences plague the city. Prior to its release, the miniseries featured 5 pieces of promotional artwork featuring all 4 Ghostbusters. Two other pieces of promotional artwork were also featured on the back of the comic books once the miniseries had begun. These featured a promo of a melting Stay Puft Marshmallow Man featuring the phrase \\"S'mores Anyone?\\" and a promo of Slimer featuring the phrase \\"Vermin Problems?\\" A special 'Christmas card' was created specially for the site, drawn by well-known Ghostbusters prop member Sean Bishop and coloured by one of the comic production staff. Outside of the 4 issue series a \\"#0 issue\\" was planned. It was to have been released before the Legion mini-series, but was eventually released as a convention exclusive at the San Diego Comic Con stall operated by 88MPH Studios to help promote the comic. =Planned ongoing series= Originally planned for a June 2004 release to coincide with the 20th Anniversary of the movie, the ongoing series of the comic was to officially start in the Summer of 2004 with three known stories. The following synopses have been collected from the official site: * Ghostbusters Monthly #1 ‚Äì In June 1984, GHOSTBUSTERS exploded into theaters and captivated a generation. Twenty years later, the boys are back in a brand new ONGOING comic book series. Now that they've saved the world twice, the Ghostbusters want to go global...but that's easier said than done. Meanwhile, a dead man is wandering the streets of New York and something wicked stirs in the Central Park Zoo. Old foes, new enemies and trusty unlicensed nuclear accelerators, this exciting first issue has it all. Because even after two decades, you know who to call. * Ghostbusters Monthly #2 ‚Äì Romance is in the air as Egon and Janine go out on their first official date, and with Peter playing the role of Cyrano things are bound to get interesting. Meanwhile, Winston goes solo, Louis gets an unwelcome visit from an old friend, and Ray takes a trip to a dark, dangerous place...the library. * Ghostbusters Monthly #3 ‚Äì With the powerful ghost known as Ahriman making trouble and Vinz Clortho back for an encore, the Ghostbusters find themselves racing from one disaster to the next. And that's before things get really bad. It turns out there's one thing worse than having two evil spirits rampaging through New York; when they get together. Due to the varying problems with finance and publishing, Sebastien Clavet announced that the ongoing Ghostbusters series would be going into indefinite hiatus with three issues planned and three covers released. =Collected edition= In early 2005 Sebastien Clavet announced the official trade collection of the series which would include a coloured version of The Zeddemore Factor one shot, concept art, 'Ecto-Logs', a foreword by Ghostbusters creator Dan Aykroyd and a proposed afterword by an as yet unknown actor related to the film. The cut-off date for pre-orders was extended several times, while a firm release date had never been announced. This trade would have been a hardcover collection that was supposed to be released via a Diamond Comic Distributors \\"Previews\\" exclusive. However, it would appear that financial problems have plagued this venture despite hundreds of paid pre-orders. Clavet has since closed his own company's message boards and removed contact information from 88MPH Studios website, leaving many disgruntled fans to level claims of fraud against Clavet. A post made on January 14, 2007 on the new 88MPH Studios website states that pre-orders placed with them and Graham crackers are guaranteed and that more information will be posted shortly. Posts entered onto the Weaver Hall forum on January 17 reference Clavet's intent to offer the hardcover to fans via the 88MPH Studios online store. But this never came to fruition. Presently, a version of the Legion Trade in Soft Cover has been released for commercial purchase, however it lacks the foreword by Aykroyd and the concept art. The book is available in the United Kingdom and was published by Titan Books. Tokyopop Tokyopop published a one-shot black and white Manga comic in 2008 called Ghostbusters: Ghost Busted. The comic comprised six mini- stories. IDW Publishing Cover to Ghostbusters #2. Art by Nick Runge.

Davis is one of the few remaining blues musicians who gained experience singing the blues in the Mississippi Delta, having sung to help pass the time while picking the cotton fields. Biography =Early life= Davis was born in Drew, Mississippi, where he was raised in the heart of Mississippi Delta. Davis got the nickname Boo Boo from his father as a child; the name derives from his three uncles James, Boo-Jack and Davis. Davis's passion for music started at age five when his mother took him to church and he played the harmonica and sang. Blues legends such as John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Robert Pete Williams and Robert Petway would visit the family home to rehearse blues songs with Davis' father, Sylvester Davis. When he was eighteen years old he began playing drums for the family band, Lard Can Band, because Davis did not possess a drum kit and was forced to play on a lard can. The band featured his multi-instrumental father, Sylvester Sr., his younger brother Sylvester Jr. on the guitar, and his sister Clara on vocals. The band played throughout the state of Mississippi, including a stint as the back up for B.B King, who was unknown at the time. =Career= Davis moved north in the early 60s and played all around the Illinois area until his older brother brought him to St. Louis where he sang with Doc Terry, Elmore James and others. Davis played in Doc Terry's band, playing the drums. After leaving Doc Terry's band, Davis started a band with Little Aaron who wrote the song East St. Louis which later featured on Davis's album of the same name. Davis and Aaron backed up several blues legends such as Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Little Milton and Elmore James. In 1972, Davis formed another family band called the Davis Brothers Band which played twice a week at a club in East St. Louis, Tabby‚Äôs Red Room, for 18 years. In 1999, Davis appeared on Arthur Williams' album Harpin' On It. In September of the same year he made his solo recording debut with Netherlands-based label Black and Tan Records. He made his first tour of Europe in 2000, performing in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France and the UK. While in the UK, he recorded music for a BBC radio show hosted by The Blues Band's Paul Jones. Davis's fourth album 'Drew, Mississippi' featured in the top 10 blues albums of 2006 according to Mojo magazine. In 2007, Davis performed live on Canadian national radio station CBC Radio One. Davis's song \\"I'm So Tired\\", was used in a television commercial for 5-Hour Energy and an episode of Sons of Anarchy.

Vellucci (1915‚Äì2002) was an American politician who served as the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served four non-consecutive terms as mayor, and was known for his often antagonistic relationship with Harvard University. Life and career Vellucci was born in Somerville, Massachusetts. His father died when Vellucci was in sixth grade, and he dropped out of school soon afterwards. He initially worked as a messenger for Western Union before becoming a candy bar deliveryman. He later opened a sandwich store. He lived in East Cambridge for much of his life. In 1951 Vellucci was elected to the Cambridge School Committee. Four years later he was elected to the Cambridge City Council. He served on the City Council for 34 years. In 1989 he was re-elected to the Cambridge School Committee for one term. He was elected to his first two-year term Mayor of Cambridge in 1971, and was also elected in 1976, 1982, and 1988. In 1991 he ran for election to the City Council but failed to win a seat. He often focused on providing services to his constituents and was skilled at grass roots campaigning. He claimed credit for promoting commercial development, such as the CambridgeSide Galleria mall. The Vellucci fountain at the CambridgeSide Galleria While he was in office, Vellucci served as an independent and promoted both liberal and conservative policies. He supported increased public housing and rent control, but also supported corporate tax cuts. He also was openly critical of anti-war protesters during the Vietnam War. In addition, he opposed condom distribution in schools. An Italian American, Vellucci was opposed to the idea that Leif Ericcson, rather than Christopher Columbus, discovered America. After a group of scholars from Harvard promoted the claim that Ericcson discovered America, he proposed a motion to the Cambridge City Council that officially renamed Harvard Square to Columbus Square. He also planted a large tree in front of the Harvard Lampoon Building, claiming that it was an eyesore and arguing that the Harvard Lampoon had insulted Italian Americans by claiming that the Irish discovered America. He feuded with the Harvard Lampoon for years. The paper often satirized him, one issue running an Alfred E. Neuman style picture of him on its cover. On one occasion, he unsuccessfully proposed a city ordinance declaring their headquarters a public urinal. Vellucci often clashed with Harvard University while serving in city leadership. He frequently attempted to convince the school to offer voluntary payment in lieu of property taxes, which they were not required to pay. He also attempted to force Harvard to pay the salaries of Cambridge Police officers to deal with students. He tried to convert parking around Harvard to resident parking, and on one occasion proposed a plan that would have converted Harvard Yard into a parking lot for public buses. In 1976, Vellucci clashed with Harvard and MIT over their plans to begin genetic engineering on recombinant DNA. He attempted to ban genetic engineering in Cambridge, where the labs for both universities were located, due to fears that scientists might accidentally create dangerous organisms. This proposed ban led to extensive hearings featuring extensive debates between scientists, including David Baltimore, and members of the Cambridge City Council. After several months the mayor allowed the proposed ban to be decided by a panel of Cambridge residents, who eventually decided against the proposed ban.

While a participant in the Canadian Senate Page Program in 2011, DePape stood in protest during the Throne Speech in the Senate, silently holding up a sign that said \\"Stop Harper!\\" This action led to her prompt dismissal, for breaching the non-partisan nature of the page position and disrupting the Governor General in Parliament. In a subsequent interview, DePape explained that she disagreed with Prime Minister Stephen Harper's policies. In an interview, then Opposition Leader Jack Layton voiced disapproval of DePape's protest, stating \\"We have been pushing for decorum in the House of Commons. You don't have decorum if people are standing up holding up signs in the middle of debates and solemn moments... We encourage protests... But it should be happening at the proper place and at the proper time.\\" DePape's protest featured as the front cover illustration for the book Contempt of Parliament by Kieron Wood, published in Ireland in January 2012. A few days after her protest in the Senate chamber, Michael Moore offered DePape a job. DePape stated that she had also received job offers from the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) and the Council of Canadians. On June 8, 2011, DePape announced the creation of a \\"Stop Harper Fund\\" to support \\"organizations and individuals engaging in creative non-violent direct actions against the Harper government's agenda.\\" The fund planned to organize an advisory committee to direct funds to selected organizations, and legal and fiscal governance to ensure the donations were spent in accordance with the fund's stated mandate.

Zonia Baber (August 24, 1862 ‚Äì January 10, 1956), born Mary Arizona Baber in Clark County, Illinois, was an American geographer and geologist best known for developing methods for teaching geography. Her teachings emphasized experiential learning through field work and experimentation.  Education and teaching career  As Baber's hometown did not offer education beyond elementary school, she moved 130 miles to Paris, Illinois to attend high school where she lived with her uncle. After high school, she attended \\"Normal school\\" to train as a teacher. Baber started her career as a private school principal from 1886‚Äì1888. She then took a job teaching at Cook County Normal School (now Chicago State University), where she served as the head of the Geography Department from 1890‚Äì1899. She taught the interdependence of structural geography, history and the natural sciences. These courses focused on primarily geography, continental study, meteorology, and mathematical geography. While teaching, Baber also took classes in geology, including the first class that accepted women. She earned her Bachelor of Science in 1904. From 1901-1921 Baber worked as an associate professor and head of geography and geology in the Department of Education at the University of Chicago. At the same time she was the principal of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When it came to teaching, Baber preferred to focus on field work ‚Äì enabling her students to act and discover rather than memorize facts. Baber's teaching methods are still used today. > \\"The student discovers too late that ordinary unrelated knowledge is not > power; that only scientific knowledge ‚Äî unified, related experiences ‚Äî are > valuable.\\" Baber promoted field trips and first-hand experience rather than the memorization of facts and definitions, but she also worked to improve conventional learning aids. During her time as chairwoman of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), she created a committee to scrutinize textbooks in order to replace antiquated or inappropriate phrases and concepts with ones intended to stop the perpetuation of negative prejudices. In 1920, Baber published \\"A Proposal for Renaming the Solar Circles in the Journal of Geography\\". The north and south solar tropics, traditionally referred to as the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer, Baber proposed the name be changed to The Northern Tropic and The Southern Tropic. Today both terms are accepted in the world of geography, though no official change was made.  Geographic Society and advocacy work  In 1898 Baber co-founded the Geographic Society of Chicago. She served as the President and was involved with the Society for 50 years. In 1948 she received a lifetime achievement award. Zonia Baber was passionate about social issues throughout her life. As a feminist and anti-imperialist, she joined as well as initiated many efforts to fight against sexism, racism, and intolerance. She was an advocate of women's suffrage in the United States, and in 1926 she represented the women of Puerto Rico in the extension of suffrage to the region. As previously mentioned, Baber served as chairwoman of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, as well as a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) Chicago branch, and as chair of the Race Relations Committee of the Chicago Women's Club Baber also traveled extensively‚Äîboth for her professional career and for her advocacy work‚Äîto attend international conferences and events. One such occasion was when she traveled with a WILPF delegation to Haiti in 1926.  Design  School desk design patented by Zonia Baber on July 7, 1896. In 1896, Zonia Baber designed a new school desk with features specifically for the teaching of geography and other sciences. Unlike a regular school desk, Zonia's featured trays and compartments meant to store learning supplies. Having these trays and compartments meant that students using her desk would always have their learning supplies at hand.

It was held at the town's Mechanics' Institute, which later became known as Albert Hall. The exhibition was in line with the founding values of the Institute, which were to extend the spread of knowledge among the people of Derby. The institute had organized a wide range of events since 1825, including lectures, concerts, and displays. The exhibition followed the first such organised by Manchester Mechanics Institute in 1837 and Derby's was one of several that were organised that year in English industrial towns and cities. Derby's exhibition had a profound impact and was one of the factors leading to the foundation of the Museum and Library in 1878. Derby Museum and Art Gallery, which is next door to what was the Mechanics Institute building, now holds many of the objects from the exhibition. The exhibition was organised to pay for a lecture hall which had just been added in 1837 to the Derby Mechanic's institute premises in the Wardwick. Although these organisations were called Mechanic's Institutes they were funded and organised by dignitaries and not by mechanics. The exhibition attracted over 96,000 people and Derby's institute as a result was placed on a good financial basis. The exhibition is the subject matter of Interior of the Mechanics' Institute, a hand coloured lithograph print from a drawing by Samuel Rayner. This print shows the Lecture Hall, which was the main hall of the Institute. The hall was described at the time as \\"in the Grecian style... with a handsome chandelier ...and many valuable paintings\\". Around the top of the room is a frieze similar to work by John Henning. Over one thousand objects were displayed there including many that belonged to the philanthropist Joseph Strutt. The exhibits to a variety of categories: paintings by Joseph Wright (Romeo and Juliet can be seen on display on the far wall, towards the left), scientific instruments, fossils, a coconut... The Derby exhibition was admired by the mechanics institutes in nearby Leicester and Nottingham and both organised similar exhibitions the following year. They also were able to charter a train on the newly opened railway to carry their members on a railway excursion.

She is founder and C.E.O. of the Stress Institute and the Mindful Living Network. She started her career in finance working at the World Trade Center in New York. After working on Wall Street, she made a decision to leave power, wealth and corporate stress behind her. Martha Stewart dubbed her the Stress Queen‚Äîwho specializes in stress management, mindful living, and work life balance. John J. Ratey M.D., Harvard, called her the midwife to a movement‚ÄîMindful Living. She established Oak Haven, a 300-acres farm in Clarkesville, Ga. in 1988, and built a health, education, and training center called The Center for Mindful Living. It also serves as a horse farm and a retreat for wildlife and abandoned/shelter dogs and cats. In her second book, A Life in Balance: Nourishing the Four Roots of True Happiness, she wrote about her journey from working on Wall Street to creating an institute for mind-body, complementary medicine. This book won the 2007 Nautilus Book Award.  Education & Training  Hall received her Masters of Divinity from Emory University and a Doctorate in Spirituality from Columbia Theological Seminary. She also has a Bachelor of Science in Finance from Jacksonville State University. Hall studied the effects of stress under medical pioneers such as Herbert Benson at the Harvard Mind/Body Institute, Dean Ornish of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute and Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Stress Reduction Center. She received tutelage in spirituality and healing from Nobel Peace Prize recipients including the Dalai Lama, Bishop Desmond Tutu and President Jimmy Carter. Throughout this journey, she worked with high-risk inner city children and at the Atlanta Day Shelter for battered women and children; facilitated cardiac rehabilitation programs; counseled and comforted the sick and dying; was involved in hospice care; and continued to explore the concept of science.meeting soul. John St. Augustine included a chapter about her in his book, Living an Uncommon Life: Essential Lessons from 21 Extraordinary People.St. Augustine, John (2006). Living an Uncommon Life: Essential Lessons from 21 Extraordinary People. Hampton Roads Publishing. p. 240. . She was also featured in the book, ‚ÄúSixty Things To Do When You Turn Sixty,‚Äù and was featured in Larry Dossey‚Äôs book, The Power of Premonitions In 1997, she founded The Center for Mindful Living, now called The Stress Institute. Many corporations, including Microsoft and Electronic Arts, Inc., recognize her as an authority in her field and asked her to be a corporate spokesperson on stress management and mindful living. Hall's ability to entertain, educate, and enlighten people (from Los Angeles to London to Paris) placed her in the spotlight as a stress and mindful living expert. Her media appearances include being on CNN, Fox News, Dr. Oz, Martha Stewart's Body and Soul, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, New York Times, WebMD, Huffington Post, TEDMED and many more. She penned her second book, Alter Your life, a candid view on mindful living that requires no doctrines or trekking off to distant lands. Hall had a traumatic brain injury and near death experience in 2009, when a car operated by a distracted driver struck her as she was crossing a street in Beverly Hills. It took years of recovery from the TBI for her to return to her work. After being away from the limelight, Hall emerged with her third book entitled Uncommon H.O.P.E., which is a prescription on how to enjoy a rich life of mindful living. The book was largely finished before her accident but was published a year later‚Äîawaiting for her final edits. Her latest book is entitled Mindful Living Everyday, which is a revised and updated edition based on her 1995 book, Alter Your Life.  Projects  In 2007, in addition to The Stress Institute, she started the Mindful Living Network. After working as a stress expert at The Stress Institute, Hall founded Mindful Living Network to promote mindfulness, health, stress resilience, and work life balance. The seed of this vision was embodied in Mindful Living TV, a TV network focused on original programming. Hall created a show called Alter Your Life about everyday people learning how to de-stress and live with mindfulness. She took five stressed out people and invited them for a weekend at The Center for Mindful Living at her Oak Haven farm, to learn about stress resilience. Her other original shows included The Meditation Room, Mindful Living Everyday, and The Way I See It. The Mindful Living Network was launched on October 2007. However, after Hall's accident, the TV network project was put on hold. It later evolved into an online outlet and digital platform. The Mindful Living Network website was launched on August 8, 2008.. The website, Mindful Living Network, is the main brand platform where its mission is share information, experiences in all aspects of sustainability and Mindful Living.

The Huss ride was opened to the public on May 4, 2003, and continues to operate today. Sledge Hammer is also the world's first and only 'giant jumping machine'. The ride has had serious mechanical issues, causing repeated closures. History When the ride was first opened during the 2003 season, the ride attracted many guests and had almost no problems. Since the mid-2010s, the ride has been hampered with so many problems that it has been almost impossible to determine when the ride would be open. Canada's Wonderland has not stated exactly what is causing all the problems with the ride. Structure The underside of the ride's \\"claw,\\" a component of the Sledge Hammer where the riders sit. Sledge Hammer is mainly made out of four different parts. The first part is the main \\"tower\\". This is where most of the machinery is located (inside) and where everything is connected to each other. The second part, is the \\"claws\\" (there are six of them). These are where riders sit during the ride. The third part is the \\"arms\\" (once again, there are six of them). These are what hold the \\"claws\\" to the main \\"tower\\" and allow the \\"claws\\" to go up and down. The fourth part is a grey \\"block like\\" piece that hold everything together and helps get the \\"claws\\" up and down. Ride experience =2003‚Äì2010= Sledge Hammer in May 2007. First, riders take a seat in one of the eight seats inside one of six \\"claws\\". Once the operators say that it is safe to proceed, all six claws raise off the ground and instantly begin to spin around the center machine holding the claws. About 10 seconds into the ride, the six \\"claws\\" instantly shoot upwards. Then, about 13 seconds later, the \\"claws\\" shoot right back down to where the ride began. Around 35 seconds of the operation of the ride, once again, the \\"claws\\" shoot back up. 10 seconds later, instead of the \\"claws\\" going straight back down, they go down only halfway and stay there for about 2 or 3 seconds. After the 2 or 3 seconds, the \\"claws\\" return to the bottom of the ride. Then, for one final time, the \\"claws\\" shoot back to the top of the ride, then instantly shoot back down. The ride then slows down and return to its \\"loading position\\" when riders exit and enter the ride. One cycle lasted about 1 minute and 20 seconds. =2011‚Äìpresent= Just like the other cycle, riders take a seat inside one of six \\"claws\\" located around the central tower. Once the operators give the \\"all clear\\", the claws raise off the ground and begin to spin around the central tower. The first (very small) change in the cycle comes when the claws \\"shoot\\" upwards at the 8 second mark instead of the 10 second mark. The second change is when instead of the claws coming down at around the 12 second mark, the claws stay up for a full 28 seconds before coming back down to the bottom of the ride. Next, the time between the \\"claws\\" spinning at the bottom of the ride and going back up is relatively the same time as the old cycle. The fourth change comes when instead of the \\"claws\\" staying at the top of the tower (second time) for 10 seconds and then going halfway down for 3 seconds followed by the claws returning to the bottom of the tower, the \\"claws\\" now stay at the top for about 25 seconds and then go straight back down without stopping in the middle. Then, the time between the \\"claws\\" on the ground to the time of going back to the top for a third time is also relatively the same. Finally, once the claws reach the top, they instantly \\"shoot\\" right back down (just like the same as the old cycle). One cycle now lasts about 2 minutes.

It is analogous to a quinone, but having one of the double bonded oxygens replaced with a carbon. The carbonyl and methylene are usually oriented either ortho or para to each other. There are some examples of transient synthetic meta quinone methides. Properties Quinone methides are cross-conjugated rather than aromatic. Nucleophilic addition at the exo-cyclic double bond will result in rearomatisation, making such reactions highly favourable. As a result, quinone methides are excellent Michael acceptors, react quickly with nucleophiles and can be easily reduced. They are able to act as radical scavengers via a similar process, a behaviour exploited by certain polymerisation inhibitors. Quinone methides are more polar than quinones, and therefore more chemically reactive. Simple unhindered quinone methides are short lived reactive intermediates that are not stable enough to be isolated under normal circumstances, they will trimerise in the absence of nucleophiles. Sterically hindered quinone methides can be sufficiently stable to be isolated, with some examples being commercially available. Preparation Quinone methides are often prepared by oxidation of the corresponding ortho or para phenol toluene. Quinone methides can be produced in aqueous solution by photochemical dehydration of o-hydroxybenzyl alcohols (i.e. salicyl alcohol). Occurrence and applications Quinones methides and their derivatives are common constituents of biological systems. Quinone methanide itself arises by the degradation of tyrosine, leading ultimately to p-cresol.Stich, T. A.; Myers, W. K.; Britt, R. D., \\"Paramagnetic intermediates generated by radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes\\", Acc. Chem. Res. 2014, 47, 2235-2243. Various quinone methides are directly involved in the process of lignification (creation of complex lignin polymers) in plants.Quinone Methides in Lignification Many quinone methides show pronounced biological activity. They have been implicated as the ultimate cytotoxins responsible for the effects of such agents as antitumor drugs, antibiotics, and DNA alkylators. Oxidation to a reactive quinone methide is the mechanistic basis of many phenolic anti-cancer drugs. Celastrol is a triterpenoid quinone methide isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii (Thunder of God vine) and Celastrus regelii that exhibits antioxidant (15 times the potency of Œ±-tocopherol), anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and insecticidal activities. Pristimerin, the methyl ester of celasterol, is a triterpenoid quinone methide isolated from Maytenus heterophylla that displays antitumor and antiviral activities. Pristimerin has also been found to have a contraceptive effect due to its inhibiting effect on the calcium channel of sperm (CatSper). Taxodone and its oxidized rearrangement product, taxodione, are diterpenoid quinone methides found in Taxodium distichum (bald cypress), Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), several Salvia species and other plants, that display anticancer, antibacterial, antioxidant, antifungal, insecticide, and antifeedant activities. Maytenoquinone, an isomer of taxodione, is a biologically active quinone methide found in Maytenus dispermus. right Kendomycin is an antitumor antibacterial quinone methide macrolide first isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces violaceoruber. It has potent activity as an endothelin receptor antagonist and anti-osteoporosis agent.Burke Research Group University of Wisconsin Elansolid A3 is a quinone methide from the bacterium Chitinophaga sancti that displays antibiotic activity. Antibacterial quinone methides, 20-epi-isoiguesterinol, 6-oxoisoiguesterin, isoiguesterin and isoiguesterinol were found in Salacia madagascariensis. Quinone methides tingenone and netzahualcoyonol were isolated from Salacia petenensis. Nortriterpenoid quinone methide amazoquinone and (7S, 8S)-7-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-tingenone were isolated from Maytenus amazonica. An antimicrobial quinone methide, 15 alpha- hydroxypristimerin, was isolated from a South American medicinal plant, Maytenus scutioides. Analogues A quinone dimethide is a related derivative in which the carbonyl group is replaced by another methylene group. A well studied example is tetracyanoquinodimethane.

Emergence (1987‚Äì90) The Parti municipal de Montr√©al was created in October 1987, when ten people met at a downtown Montreal hotel for its inaugural meeting. Alain Andr√© was chosen as the party's leader and its official colours were designated as turquoise and grey. Two months later, the party was officially registered at city hall.Lewis Harris, \\"Upstarts at city hall; Municipal Party wins votes without money or platform,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 June 1989, B6. The PMM was an obscure organization during its first year, having no official platform and very little money. It first came to the public's attention in April 1989, when Andr√© ran in a council by-election in the Sault-au-Recollet ward and finished only twenty-five votes behind the winning candidate, the attorney Serge Sauvageau, a newcomer in politics.Gretta Chambers, \\"Rudderless city hall lets Montreal,\\" Montreal Gazette, 20 April 1989, B3. Two months later, PMM candidate Stavros Zagakos won an upset victory in a by-election in Parc-Extension, in Montreal's Greek neighbourhood.Lewis Harris, \\"Upstarts at city hall; Municipal Party wins votes without money or platform,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 June 1989, B6. During this period, the Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM), a party with social democratic origins, was the dominant municipal political force in Montreal. The MCM won a landslide victory in the 1986 election, taking the mayor's office and all but three of the fifty-eight seats on council. The formerly dominant Civic Party of Montreal of Jean Drapeau fell to only one seat; it later gained two more through by-elections and defections but subsequently fell victim to factional infighting. When the PMM emerged as a credible political force, some speculated that it would either merge with or replace the Civic Party to form a united conservative opposition.Lewis Harris, \\"Upstarts at city hall; Municipal Party wins votes without money or platform,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 June 1989, B6. At least one political observer speculated that the PMM only existed to give Drapeau's former lieutenant Yvon Lamarre a second option for a political vehicle if he failed to gain control of the Civic Party. The PMM's presence on council grew throughout 1989 and 1990. Civic Party councillors Nick Auf der Maur and Serge Sauvageau joined in November 1989, having become estranged from their former party's leadership.\\"Auf der Maur, Sauvageau join Municipal Party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 November 1989, A5. Former MCM councillor Frank Venneri also joined in the same month, saying the governing party had \\"lost the common touch.\\"\\"MCM loses two councillors from its ranks,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 December 1989, A3. The other former MCM councillor mentioned in the title became an independent. Another former MCM councillor, Pierre Bastien, joined in April 1990. The PMM became the official opposition party through these defections, and Auf der Maur served as the party's leader on council.\\"Montrealers' \`everyday concerns' prompted party switch: Bastien,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 April 1990, A3; David Johnston, \\"Former Quebec diplomat urged to challenge Dore in race for mayor's seat,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 April 1990, A3. The PMM and Civic Party held merger talks in 1990, which Andr√© broke off after concluding that unity between the parties was impossible. Shortly thereafter, he was formally chosen as the PMM's mayoral candidate for the 1990 municipal election.Lewis Harris, \\"Municipal party chief Andre will be candidate for mayor,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 May 1990, A3. The party held its first policy convention in August 1990, and supported such measures as tax increase deferrals for the elderly, a requirement for all new city employees to live in Montreal, and the creation of a special by-law enforcement unit.Lewis Harris, \\"Municipal Party gears up to talk policy; Delegates hammer out platform at convention today,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 August 1990, A3. 1990 election In addition to Andr√©'s mayoral bid, the PMM ran fifty-seven council candidates in 1990 election. One of its key election promises was to lift a moratorium on converting apartments to condominiums; an article in the Montreal Gazette described the party as being centered around former Civic Party stalwarts.Irwin Block, \\"Why is this man smiling?; Looks like Jean Dore's MCM will hold on to power while opposition parties fight it out,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 October 1990, B6; Irwin Block, \\"Campaign '90 has been short on promises,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 November 1990, A8. The MCM won another landslide majority on election day, while the PMM fell to only three council seats: those of Andr√©, Auf der Maur, and newcomer Pierre Gagnier. Andr√© finished a distant third in the mayoral contest, and all of the party's other incumbents were defeated.Lewis Harris and Ingrid Peritz, \\"Easy MCM win; Dore cruises to his second mandate,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 November 1990, A1. Candidates could run for both mayor and council. The party remained the official opposition on council after the election. Decline (1990‚Äì94) The PMM was destroyed by internal divisions after the 1990 election. Several members of the party's strategy committee resigned in May 1991, criticizing Andr√©'s leadership. Later in the year, Auf der Maur left the PMM to rejoin the Civic Party, and Gagnier left to sit as an independent. Andr√© resigned as party leader on January 27, 1992, saying he was acting for the good of the party; he was replaced on an interim basis by Claude Lachapelle.\\"Andre quits as Municipal Party leader,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 January 1992, B6. The PMM announced plans to merge with the Civic Party in June 1992, and Andr√© indicated that he would join the Civic Party group on council.Mike King, \\"Civic Party absorbs Municipal Party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 July 1992, A3. The party merger was delayed, however, and Andr√© technically remained a PMM councillor until leaving to sit as an independent in January 1994.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Last Municipal Party councillor jumps ship; Andre gives no reasons for his decision to sit as independent at city hall,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 January 1994, A4.

Life  James Lyon was born in Newark, New Jersey on July 1, 1735. It is known that his father was Zopher Lyon, but that he was orphaned at an early age. In 1750, Isaac Lyon and John Crane became James' guardians, until the age of twenty-one. Lyon then attended college at Nassau Hall, and afterwards obtained a master's degree from College of Philadelphia. Lyon became a Presbyterian minister, and left from Philadelphia for Nova Scotia, but he was unable to support his family, and subsequently accepted a job at the new settlement of Machias, Maine. After his first year there, the parish invited him to remain at a raised salary and he remained there with a few interruptions, until his death on October 12, 1794.Our American Music, A Comprehensive History from 1620 to the Present, John Tasker Howard, Fourth Edition  Music  The first evidence of Lyon composing was during his college days at the commencement of 1759 at Nassau Hall, when President Samuel Davies delivered an oration, and where the ceremony concluded with an ODE, set to music by Lyon. In 1761, when a candidate for a master's degree at the College of Philadelphia, one of his works was performed on the same program as an Ode by Francis Hopkinson. While living in Philadelphia, Lyon produced his Urania, or A Choice Collection of Psalm-Tunes, Anthems and Hymns in 1761. This contained many English tunes as well as six original works by Lyon, including; Two Celebrated Verses by Sternhold and Hopkins an Anthem taken from the 150th Psalm and the 104th Psalm by Dr. Watts. Though many early historians stated that Urania was a failure, it was the first music collection compiled by an American composer and rather progressive and influential.

Action languages are commonly used in the artificial intelligence and robotics domains, where they describe how actions affect the states of systems over time, and may be used for automated planning. Action languages fall into two classes: action description languages and action query languages. Examples of the former include STRIPS, PDDL, Language A (a generalization of STRIPS; the propositional part of Pednault's ADL), Language B (an extension of A adding indirect effects, distinguishing static and dynamic laws) and Language C (which adds indirect effects also, and does not assume that every fluent is automatically \\"inertial\\").

Several different algorithms exist for converting action languages, and in particular, action language C, to answer set programs.Vladimir Lifschitz and Hudson Turner, (1998) \\"Representing Transition Systems by Logic Programs\\". Since modern answer-set solvers make use of boolean SAT algorithms to very rapidly ascertain satisfiability, this implies that action languages can also enjoy the progress being made in the domain of boolean SAT solving.

He was killed on Little Round Top during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Early life USMA Cadet Charles E. Hazlett during his final year at the academy. Hazlett was born in Zanesville, Ohio to Robert Hazlett and Lucy Welles Reed.Charles Hazlett tombstone, Woodlawn Cemetery, Zanesville, Ohio. Hazlett's parents were abolitionists and supporters of the Underground Railroad in central Ohio. After briefly attending Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, he was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. During his first year at the academy, he was court-martialed and suspended for several months, but later graduated on May 6, 1861, fifteenth in his class.Sergent, 138-139. Civil War Initially assigned to the 2nd U.S. Cavalry as a 2nd lieutenant, Hazlett was almost immediately promoted to 1st lieutenant and transferred to Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery. He was part of the battery during its near annihilation at the First Battle of Bull Run, fought through the battles of the Peninsula Campaign and was in command of the battery by the Second Battle of Bull Run. Under his command, the unit also participated in the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Gettysburg View from Little Round Top July 3rd 1863 at 7:30 PM by Edwin Forbes Looking from the position of Hazletts Battery on Little Round Top toward the Valley of Death On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Hazlett's Battery (3rd Division, V Corps), consisting of six three inch, 10 pounder Parrott rifles, was rushed to the top of Little Round Top by Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren. Maneuvering the guns by hand up the steep and rocky slope of the hill was a difficult achievement. The artillerymen were exposed to constant Confederate sniper fire and could not work the guns effectively. More significantly, they could not depress the cannons' barrels sufficiently enough to defend against incoming infantry attacks.Pfanz, pp. 223-24. While standing near the battery during the intense fighting, Brig. Gen. Stephen H. Weed was mortally wounded and asked to see Hazlett. Reportedly, Hazlett came to his aid and was shot in the head by a sharpshooter hiding in Devil's Den as he knelt down to hear what Weed was saying.Weed-Hazlett monument at Gettysburg Command of the battery passed to 2nd Lt Benjamin F. Rittenhouse. Burial Hazlett's body was originally buried at the Jacob Weikert house near Little Round Top. Later, his body was reinterred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Zanesville, Ohio. In memoriam Four months after Hazlett's death, the U.S. War Department named a redoubt near Portsmouth, Virginia in his honor.Miscellaneous Documents, 444 A 19th century rock carving on Little Round Top supposedly designates the spot where Hazlett was killed. A stone marker sitting atop the rock memorializes both he and Brig. Gen. Stephen Weed. After the Civil War, veterans formed a local chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic in Hazlett's hometown. The chapter was named Hazlett Post 81 in honor of Hazlett and his brother, Capt. John C. Hazlett, an infantry officer who died from a wound suffered at the Battle of Stones River.Sergent, 139. In 2011, local Civil War enthusiasts replaced the Hazlett brothers' broken tombstones at Woodlawn Cemetery in Zanesville, Ohio.

In 1894 he went to the Municipal Theatre in Augsburg, in 1896 to Mainz and in 1897 to the Royal Court Theatre in Hanover. From 1899 to 1905, he spent six years as a part of the ensemble of the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg and from 1905 onwards at various Berlin theatres. Schroth made his film debut in the 1916 Walter Schmidth√§ssler-directed drama Welker Lorbeer. He spent the 1910s in numerous German silent film productions, working with such directors as George Jacoby, Robert Wiene and Harry Piel. His career in the 1920s was prolific, and he appeared opposite such silent film actors as Lil Dagover, Emil Jannings, Paul Wegener and Brigitte Helm and transitioned to sound film with ease. During World War II Heinrich Schroth participated in a large number of film productions for the Nazi Party, including propaganda films for the Nazi regime.Klee, Ernst: The Cultural Encyclopedia of the Third Reich: Who was Who Before and after 1945.

Military background  Born 10 May 1843, at Corfu, where his father, William Henry Banks (1817‚Äì1880), was then billeted with the Royal Artillery. His mother, Ann Anderson, was formerly a seamstress of Carlisle, Cumbria. His father was a remarkable soldier, and one of only a handful of 19th-century soldiers to have received a commission from the ranks on raw ability. In November 1854, William Banks was Sergeant-Major of Field Battery 'H' with the Royal Artillery, then engaged at the Battle of Inkerman where he had his horse shot from under him. Following the battle, Brigadier-General Sir Richard Dacres, sanctioned by Field-Marshal Lord Raglan, recommended him for a commission arising from an act of \\"distinguished conduct in the field\\". This was approved by Horse Guards in May 1855, when he was raised to the rank of lieutenant, without purchase. Having started his career in 1838 as a gunner, William Banks rose to brevet major and was retired on full pay in 1872 with the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel, 97th Regiment of Foot ‚Äì a considerable achievement for the time.  Early career  War Office records provide insight into the effort by which both father and son sought to further young Joseph's military ambitions. In 1860, his father (then a captain) sought to obtain for him a commission, with or without purchase, both within the regular British army and with a colonial regiment, but he was turned down in both cases. In 1862, Joseph sat and passed his entry exams to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, but did not attend, probably due to the family's inability to find the funds to send him there. He again passed his exams for a direct commission in 1863, but on being offered a commission \\"with purchase\\" in the Gold Coast Regiment, the family again could not raise the required capital. Despite these best efforts to gain a commission, in December 1864, Banks was forced to enlist as a private soldier with the 17th Royal Lancers (known as the \\"Duke of Cambridge's Own\\"). His ability did not go unnoticed, and he was promoted corporal the following year and sergeant in 1867. His father then again sought to further the career of his son by apparently invoking the interest of the commander-in-chief, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, in the process. Something worked, and Colonel Drury Curzon Drury- Lowe, the commander of the 17th Lancers who had just promoted \\"this fine young soldier\\" to sergeant, was able to recommend him for a commission two months later. On 26 June 1867, Banks was finally commissioned as an ensign with the 24th (The 2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot. Only a few weeks before, Gonville Bromhead VC also joined that regiment as an ensign, and he and Banks served alongside one another for eight years.  British Cavalry  Banks was promoted to second lieutenant and then lieutenant of the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Foot. In 1875, the same year that that regiment departed for South Africa ‚Äì leading to their decisive actions at the Battle of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift ‚Äì Banks transferred to the 12th Royal Lancers as adjutant to the regiment. In 1880, having been promoted to captain, Banks again transferred to another cavalry regiment, the 7th Dragoon Guards, to which he remained attached for the remainder of his career. With the 7th Dragoons, he took part in the 1882 Egyptian Campaign, serving on Lord Kitchener's staff as brigade major to the cavalry in the Army of Occupation at Egypt. Banks saw action at Massawa, where (similarly to his father at the Battle of Inkerman) he had his horse shot from under him. He also took part in the Moonlight Charge at Kassassin during the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. For his part, he received the Egypt Medal (1882‚Äì1889), and the Turkish awards of the Khedive Bronze Star and the Order of the Medjidie, 5th Class. In 1883, the 7th Dragoon Guards removed to the Punjab, India, where in 1885 Banks was promoted to major. There he was appointed commandant of the Kasauli Hill Depot. He enjoyed several other staff and regimental appointments, including that of musketry instructor to the Dragoon Guards and officiating assistant adjutant-general of the Bombay Army under Field Marshal Lord Roberts V.C. Banks retired on half-pay, on his 48th birthday, 1891. From the Punjab he removed with his family to Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon. New Zealand Mounted Rifles Appointment of Major Joseph Henry Banks to temporary command of the Auckland Militia and Volunteer District from 1st April, 1897. Taken from personnel file (1899 - 1902) In 1895, Banks was brought out of retirement and posted to New Zealand to instruct the Colony's militia. In 1897, he was invited to apply for the post of temporary commandant of the Auckland Militia and North Island Volunteers, with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in the New Zealand Militia. With the permission of Horse Guards in London, he took up the appointment on 1 April 1897, initially for a period of three months. The appointment was renewed every three months until April 1898, when it became a permanent position. In this capacity, Lt.-Colonel Banks raised and trained the Auckland detachments of the first six of the ten contingents of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles. Banks was a skilled horseman and polo player, making polo compulsory for the troops he was training in practice for combat on horseback. In 1901, Banks accompanied the 6th Mounted Rifles and embarked to South Africa for service in the Boer Wars. His joined his eldest son, Lieutenant Harry Cecil Banks (1878‚Äì1906) R.A., who had come the previous year with the 2nd Mounted Rifles, and was then attached to the 78th Battery of the Royal Field Artillery under the command of Banks's brother-in-law, Lt.-Colonel Duncan Campbell Carter (1856‚Äì1942). Banks' second son, Bertram, accompanied his father to South Africa as lieutenant and adjutant of the 6th Mounted Rifles, until they returned in 1902, when he transferred to the 10th Mounted Rifles until the end of the war. 1902 also saw Major-General Sir James Melville Babington take over as commander of the New Zealand Defence Force. He happened to be a cousin of Colonel Banks' wife, and was one of the best-known proponents of the usefulness of mounted troops, particularly in the Boer Wars. As commander of the 6th New Zealand Mounted Rifles, Colonel Banks led this troop into action at the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony. In August 1901, Lord Kitchener, on whose staff Banks had served as brigade major in Egypt, requested that he take temporary command of Remounts until rejoining the 6th Mounted Rifles for their return to New Zealand in May 1902. For his service in the Boer Wars, Banks received the King's South Africa Medal and five clasps. Shortly before his departure from South Africa, Banks retired from the regular army and received his final promotion in the British Army to that of lieutenant colonel, 7th Dragoon Guards, 8 April 1902. The British Army and Navy Gazette of 17 May 1902, carried the following notice: Five years after he had left New Zealand, following their highly praised contribution to the Boer Wars, in 1910 the contingents Banks had raised, trained and accompanied into battle were re- organised into professional regular regiments, becoming the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, which was the nucleus of the modern New Zealand Army.  Retirement  After his final retirement, Banks remained in New Zealand until 1905. He had become very involved in the Auckland Racing Club and the Auckland Trotting Club. He remained in New Zealand possibly still in an advisory capacity to the militia, and was also called upon for local military ceremonies and inspections: Last week, Colonel Banks visited Coromandel, and reviewed the local martial array. The heat was very oppressive and the evolutions somewhat brisk. The sun's rays were somewhat striking, but one of the officers of the corps had come provided for either heat or rain. He took shelter from the sun under his umbrella. Presently, Colonel Banks passed along the line, and, with remarkable gallantry, the local officer proffered a portion of his kindly shelter to his superior officer. That stern warrior looked with ineffable scorn at the subaltern, took his measure from head to toe, and then, more in sorrow than in anger, said, \\"Well, well, this is the first time I have seen a volunteer on service take shelter under an umbrella; from henceforth this corps must be called the 'Gingham Corps'. Joseph Banks was also a talented artist, and earned a reputation as something of a war artist, with some of his pen-and-ink drawings of the events in the campaigns in which he took part being hung in the Portsmouth Museum in England today. In recognition of his contribution to the reputation of the New Zealand army under combat, his medals and military memorabilia were donated to the Queen Elizabeth II Army Memorial Museum at Waiouru, North Island, in 1996.  Family  On 9 September 1876, at the Church of St. Nicholas in Chadlington, Oxfordshire, then Lieutenant Joseph Henry Banks married (Frances) Edith Carter (1854‚Äì1950). She was the eldest daughter of Willoughby Harcourt Carter and his wife Eliza Palmes (1831‚Äì1903), of the Palmes family, the third daughter of George Palmes (1776‚Äì1851), J.P., D.L., of Naburn Hall, Yorkshire. The couple were married by the bride's uncle, Rev. George Carpenter (1831‚Äì1891), of Langston House (the Parsonage at Chadlington), where their reception was held. George Carpenter was the husband of Mrs Banks' aunt and godmother, Frances Edith Palmes. Colonel and Mrs Banks were the parents of three sons and two daughters. Lt.-Colonel Joseph Henry Banks died at his home at Nuwara Eliya in 1916. Mrs Banks and her daughters continued to reside there, briefly living with her son Ralph on his tea estate before moving to Colombo, where her eldest daughter had since taken up residence with her husband, Ian Stewart (1885‚Äì1956), at India House. Shortly before World War II, she and both her daughters left Ceylon for Lee-on-the-Solent. Though ordered to do so, during the Blitz Mrs Banks refused to move from her cottage and proudly collected bomb shrapnel from her garden for her grandchildren.

It was founded by William Barnett Armson (1832/3‚Äì1883), and after his death, became the practice of two architects who articled with him, John James Collins (1855‚Äì1933) and Richard Dacre Harman (1859‚Äì1927). History Armson, Collins and Harman was one of the two oldest architectural firms in the country. The practice was founded by Armson in 1870 who was one of the most prolific architects in early Christchurch. Having been articled to Armson as a young architect, J.J. Collins bought the firm after Armson‚Äôs death. Four years later, Collins brought Harman (a son of Richard James Strachan Harman) into partnership with him, Harman also having previously articled with Armson. Collins and Harman may have been the first New Zealand-born, educated and trained Christchurch architects. John Goddard Collins (1886‚Äì1965) joined his father‚Äôs staff in 1903. In 1928, the firm's name was shortened to Collins and Harman. John Kempthorne Collins (1916‚Äì1983), son of J.G. Collins, joined the firm at a later date.

He served as President of the Central Bank of Argentina from 1989 to 1991, and was nominated as running-mate by Ricardo Alfons√≠n for his 2011 campaign for the Presidency. Life and times Gonz√°lez Fraga was born in Buenos Aires as the youngest of four children to Elvira Fraga and N. Gonz√°lez Casartelli. He earned a degree in Economics with honors at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, and in 1974, was brought on by La Naci√≥n, one of the nation's leading news dailies, as a financial columnist. He later earned a fellowship at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, and at the London School of Economics. He married B√°rbara Morea Gim√©nez, and had two children; they later separated. He established a dairy farm, La Salamandra, near Luj√°n, Buenos Aires, in 1979, and continued to write on finance and economics, authoring El Mercado de Capitales (1982) and El Sistema Financiero (1980 and 1985). He served as adviser to the State enterprise bureau during the Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n Administration, and was hired by BCCI principal Ghaith Pharaon to manage debt- equity swaps for the bank, as well as portfolio investments that included the Park Hyatt Buenos Aires. =Tenure at the Central Bank= The election of Justicialist Party candidate Carlos Menem in 1989, and his reliance on the agribusiness conglomerate Bunge & Born for economic policy during the presidential transition, gave the company's Chief Operating Officer, Orlando Ferreres, the power to choose most of the new administration's economic team. He recommended the relatively young Gonz√°lez Fraga, who was well known to the local banking sector as a policy consultant, to be the new President of the Central Bank.Clar√≠n. S√≠ntesis de la semana. June 25, 1989. The nominee informed the President-elect that he had not voted for him (harboring policy differences, as well, with Bunge & Born personnel); Gonz√°lez Fraga, nevertheless, was sworn in with the new administration on July 8. Gonz√°lez Fraga leveraged business confidence in the new economic team to stabilize the highly undervalued austral, and despite favoring greater exchange rate flexibility in light of the critical need for foreign exchange reserves (which had declined to around us$120 million, with us$4.5 billion in arrears), Gonz√°lez Fraga eliminated trade finance lines of credit and increased U.S. dollar purchases from exporters. These measures created friction with both the agricultural sector and Bunge & Born itself, though he continued to enjoy Menem's support. The austral, which had fallen sharply (from 450 to 650 per dollar) in the days prior to Menem's July 8 inaugural in anticipation of a devaluation, stabilized. The financial crisis continued to exert pressure on prices, however, and monthly inflation reached 197% in July. The National Mint could not meet demand for banknotes, and in response, the new Central Bank President ordered the mint to triple production by printing higher denominations on old (circa-1980) Peso ley templates, and issuing bills printed on only one side. The crisis subsided in August, and by September, monthly inflation was in single digits. Gonz√°lez Fraga, however, remained in strained terms with the Bunge & Born-dominated Economy Ministry, and sought as much independence for the Central Bank as possible. Ultimately, however, Economy Minister N√©stor Rapanelli's opposition to Gonz√°lez Fraga's call for a floating exchange rate led the central banker to resign on November 24. These news added to concerns that the us$2 billion in new portfolio investment envisaged in July failed to materialize, and amid a new currency crisis, Rapanelli himself resigned three weeks later. Menem loyalist Antonio Erman Gonz√°lez was named President of the Central Bank in March 1990, and Gonz√°lez Fraga returned to the institution as its Vice President. A reversal of the roles each had in 1989, this partnership continued when in June, he succeeded Erman Gonz√°lez, while the latter retained the Economy Ministry. Even as the nation's finances stabilized, his agenda in the ensuing months was topped by difficult repayment negotiations over mounting foreign debt arrears (which had reached us$6 billion by then), as well as by ongoing investigations into securities fraud allegedly committed against the Central Bank by numerous institutions during the crisis.Quintela, Roberto. Crisis bancarias y corrupci√≥n. Buenos Aires: Editorial Dunken, 2005. Revelations in January 1991 that Menem Administration officials had solicited bribes from beef processor Swift & Company, as well as a renewed currency crisis, led to the resignation of the entire economic team. =Later life= Gonz√°lez Fraga in a conversation with (from left) Congressman Ricardo Gil Lavedra, UCR presidential candidate Ricardo Alfons√≠n, and Miguel Bazze of the Buenos Aires Province UCR during the 2011 elections. Gonz√°lez Fraga returned to the private sector. He was named Director of the Argentine Institute of Capital Markets, a think tank associated with the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, and was later named Vice President of the Stock Exchange. He remained active as a dairy farmer. He established a manufacturing plant at La Salamandra in 1991, and introduced buffalo mozzarella to Argentina; La Salamandra's dulce de leche, a traditional Argentine confection, earned first place at the 2000 Fancy Food Show of New York. He also returned to academia, and was given tenure as Professor of Economics at his alma mater in 1994. He earned a Konex Award for his role as an entrepreneur in 1998, and in 2004, was offered the post of Director of the National Arts Fund by President N√©stor Kirchner; personal differences with actress Nacha Guevara, a key Kirchner supporter, stymied the appointment, however. Gonz√°lez Fraga became known as one of the nation's foremost experts and proponents of Keynesian economics. He would influence a number of future policy makers in Argentina, including Mart√≠n Lousteau, with whom he wrote Sin Atajos (\\"Without Shortcuts\\") in 2005, and D√©bora Giorgi, who worked with Gonz√°lez Fraga during his tenure at the Central Bank. He himself, however, never garnered an appointment to the powerful Economy Ministry, despite having been frequently considered for the post. Close to important figures in both the center-left UCR and the center-right Federal Peronism, Gonz√°lez Fraga was entrusted by UCR presidential nominee Ricardo Alfons√≠n to offer former Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna the vice-presidential slot for the 2011 elections; Lavagna reportedly instead persuaded Gonz√°lez Fraga to run with Alfons√≠n, and on June 2, their UCR ticket was formally announced. They placed third with 11% of the vote.

He was the son born to Josephus and his wife, an unnamed Jewish noblewoman. The parents of Matthias were distant relatives. Matthias‚Äô mother was a descendant of Josephus‚Äô paternal great grandfather, Simon Psellus. His paternal grandparents were Matthias Curtus and his unnamed Jewish wife. Through his paternal grandfather, he was the descendant of the High Priest Jonathon. Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High Priest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC-76 BC. Matthias married an unnamed Jewish noblewoman, who had descended from royalty and of the former ruling Hasmonean Dynasty. Matthias with his wife had two sons: * Matthias * Josephus, the Roman Jewish Historian Life He was a contemporary to the Herodian Dynasty governing Judea and the surrounding territories. Matthias followed his paternal ancestors and served as a Priest in the Temple in Jerusalem. He was an aristocratic priest. One of his duties was to oversee the affairs of the Jewry in Jerusalem and Palestine during the Roman occupation. Josephus in his writings highly praises his father and describes him as a distinguished Jew. He describes him that way because not just of his birth alone but he was praised for his sense of justice for being a very eminent man in Jerusalem. Matthias and his family had connections to the Sadducees. Matthias and his wife were alive during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War. The war occurred from 66 until 73. In the year 70 during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem, Matthias; his wife and Josephus‚Äô first wife were in the city during the siege. The three were held as prisoners by the Jewish rebels because they didn‚Äôt trust them.

It is located along Suryapet and Warangal highway Geography and demographics The village is spread across 3 km¬≤ and has total population of approximately 4205. The village possesses cultural diversity with Hindu's, Muslims and Christians. The literacy percentage of the village is 38% Shambuni Cheruvu History The village, like many other villages in the district (and in Telangana), faced a major threat from \\"Rajakarulu\\", a private militia organized by Qasim Razvi to support the rule of Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII and resist the integration of Hyderabad State in India. Village citizens used to hide themselves in forest areas around the village to escape from killings of the Nizam Army. There are some notable persons who scarified their lives fighting against the army for freedom. Sunrise over Lake Kotha Kunta Historical places Sunset over Lake Shambuni Cheruvu One of the historical places in the village is 'Shambhuni Gudi' (Shivalayam; a temple of Shiva), located on the banks of Shabhuni Cheruvu (a major reservoir of the village). The temple was constructed during the ruling of Rudrama Devi of the Kakatiya dynasty. The architectural style of the temple is characteristic of Shiva temples built by Kakatiya rulers. However, over a period of time, the temple was demolished and has never been recovered by Archeological department of India. The other notable place is 'Anjaneya Swamy Gudi (Temple of Lord Hanuman who is a disciple of Lord Rama in the war against the demon king Ravana). The temple is located centrally in the village. It is part of the local custom and Hindu wedding ritual for newly wedded couples to visit the temple before they enter their home. Festivals and events Village people actively celebrate most major festival of the Hindu religion - Sankranti, Ugadi, Diwali, Vijayadashami and Muslim festivals like Ramzan (Ramadan), Bakra Eid, Peerla Panduga (Muharram [(kanthama mahesheswraswamy festival) (it's a Gouds' famous festival)]. Every two years, the village hosts the major carnival called 'Gangadevamma Jathara', a festival that is celebrated by villagers that worship the Goddess Ganga (aka Ganges, personified as a goddess, worshiped by Hindus who believe that the prayers towards the goddess would bring more rain and water to the village). This festival includes people from surrounding villages who camp near the temple for few days and participate in the celebrations. Every year the women in the village celebrate a Telangana traditional festival called Bathukamma. Women celebrating Bathukamma Peerla Panduga is a Muslim festival that was enjoyed by all the people in the village irrespective of their religion. Agriculture and other occupations Freshly dug peanuts The village is predominately dependent on agriculture, the irrigation of which is dependent on rainfall. There are 4 major reservoirs located around the village for irrigation. They are - Shambhuni cheruvu (built by Rudrama Devi), Kotha Kunta, Ayyavaari Kunta, and Garu Kunta. There is also a small check dam built on a creek that passes by the village, which also serves as a source for irrigation. About 10,000 acres of land are cultivated each year. Crops that are grown include:paddy, peanuts, red chili, mung bean (also known as green gram or golden gram), pigeon pea (also known as yellow dal) and cotton. Lately, there has been the introduction of commercial crops: mangos, oranges, and others. The village is surrounded by more than ten Lambada Thandas (Banjara Thanda) that provide much of the agricultural labor. Red Chili crop All the crops except cotton are marketed in Suryapet agriculture market yard. Cotton is usually sold in the Warangal market. There are a significant number of people in the village who belongs to Golla or Yadav. Their traditional occupation has been rearing sheep, goats and cattle and selling them in nearby Angadi (Rural supermarkets in Telangana region). As did many Telangana region villages, had a weekly Angadi (every Saturday) until 1998. People relied on the angadi for their daily household goods. The angadis were an alternative supermarket concept for villages in most of the Telangana districts. Cotton being picked by hand In late 1980s, the village was famous for producing most Kallu. There are two main types of kallu produced: Thadi Kallu (from Toddy Palmyra trees) and Eetha Kallu (from silver date palms). Eetha Kallu is very sweet and less intoxicating, whereas Thati Kallu is stronger (sweet in the morning, becoming sour to bitter-sour in the evening) and is highly intoxicating. People enjoy kallu right at the trees where it is brought down. They drink from the leaves by holding them to their mouths while the Goud pours the kallu from the Kunda (kallu pot). There are different types of toddy (kallu) according to the season: 1. poddathadu, 2. parpudthadu, 3. pandudthadu, and 4. mogadthadu. A good portion of the village population (called Goud) rely on selling 'Kallu' for their living.

Though he was knowledgeable in many Chinese martial arts, he was a master in Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis and Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan. Early life Gene Chen was born in Shanghai 1938, the Year of the Tiger. He lived there with his father, mother, two older sisters and two younger brothers until the family fled to Hong Kong due to the Chinese Revolution (1949) following World War II. As a boy, Gene and his younger brothers would often be surrounded and harassed by neighborhood bullies when walking home from school. Gene stood his ground and did what he could to protect his younger brothers. Since these bullies had learned martial arts, Gene decided that he needed to learn a system that he could use to defeat them. He approached Chu Yu Hing's top disciple, Dong Yet Long and asked to learn Chu Gar Southern Mantis style. Master Dong was a cook at a local school when young Gene first met him. Master Dong initially refused to teach, denying any knowledge of martial arts. Gene was persistent though, and after making offerings of chicken, pork and wine, with his mother by his side, he was finally accepted as a student. Shortly after, Gene was introduced to Chu Yu Hing, and for the next for 7 years, under their tutelage; he patiently devoted himself to learning Southern Praying Mantis. He had discovered his lifelong passion for martial arts. Move to America In 1959, along with his family, Gene Chen moved to the USA and settled in San Francisco. On the boat trip across the Pacific Ocean, he met Choi Gam Man, a student of Yi Sui, Master of Chow Gar Southern Praying Mantis. He asked Choi to teach him Chow Gar, but as Choi‚Äôs purpose in going to America was to join his father Choi Hok Peng to help teach Yang-style tai chi chuan, he would not teach Mantis. He did agree to teach Gene Yang‚Äôs Taiji and they passed the long trip days practicing martial arts together. Over the decades that followed, Gene worked to make a living and to save money for his return trips to study in China. He was trained as a drafter and had an impeccable hand, but disliked being confined inside an office and having to wear a starched shirt and tie. Eventually he left drafting and took a series of odd jobs to make money, such as serving as a translator for Vietnamese refugees and working as a bellhop. Gene was so focused on his martial arts that when his job was a shipping receiver in one of the Jack Tar Hotels' loading dock, he installed his wooden dummy in a nearby storeroom so he could get in some extra practice when things were slow. Over the years he took many extended trips back to Hong Kong, often staying for 6 months at a time to get intensive training with Yi Sui, Chu Yu Hing and Dong Yet Long. In 1970 Master Dong conferred on Gene Chen the title of Chief Instructor with certificate and Chu Yu Hing granted the title of Instructor with certificate in 1971. With his certificates in hand, he began his career as a martial arts teacher. In 1971, Gene opened his first school in the Richmond District, San Francisco. When the rent got too high at the first location, they relocated class to the basement of a local Japanese church. However, the school still was not providing the financial return on his time and effort that Gene desired and he closed it for good in 1975. He continued to teach Yang‚Äôs Taiji, Southern Praying Mantis and Wing Chun at his house through 1980. During these years Gene especially enjoyed going out to different martial arts schools to test himself against other martial artists and other fighting styles. His Praying mantis training served him very well in these encounters. Family life Family was very important to Gene and he remained close to his relatives all his life even though their interactions were often contentious and dramatic. He was always ready to help out his siblings, whether it was taking care of his sister‚Äôs rental properties or driving his old VW Beetle down to Los Angeles to help his brother move. Gene took his role as the eldest son very seriously and even remodeled the lower floor of his house to make a comfortable room for his mother to live. For the better part of 20 years she lived at his home. Eventually Gene settled down and married. His only child, a daughter was born the next year. Near the end of his life, Gene confided to his brother that the best times in his life were practicing martial arts with his students and seeing his wife and daughter happy. Chen style In 1980 Chen decided to stop teaching the Southern Mantis because its focus on fighting means that it is not suitable to teach to everyone. Having resolved to give up publicly teaching Southern Mantis, he decided to pursue his study of Taijiquan. He was already familiar with Yang‚Äôs Taiji, and several years earlier (in 1965) he learned the Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan from his grandparents' former bodyguard. On his return trips to China Gene sought out the best Taiji teachers he could find. After additional training in Yang‚Äôs Taiji with Master Fu Zhongwen and Wu-style taijiquan with Master Ma Yuehliang, Gene began to study the Chen‚Äôs Style with Lei Munyi and Chen Zhaokui, the 18th generation Grand Master. In 1980 Chen Zhaokui introduced Gene to Feng Zhiqiang. A few days later, Master Feng came to visit Gene in his hotel and the two men practiced pushing hands together. After his return to the USA, Gene Chen received a letter from Feng. In the letter, Master Feng noted Chen had natural ability, sensitivity and the relaxation to learn well. He praised Gene for his years of hard work and encouraged him to continue his practice. The following year, 1981, Chen Zhaokui died. When Gene returned to China later in the year he chose to continue his Taiji study with Master Feng. Since Feng was still working at his job in the machine shop, Gene took evening lessons at Feng‚Äôs home in the Zhong Wen Area of Beijing. In 1982 Gene Chen was honored to become Master Feng‚Äôs very first disciple. Gene practiced hard and returned to China to visit Feng (and also to Chen‚Äôs Village) many times to continue his studies. In recognition of his achievements in Chen's Taiji, Gene Chen's name was included on a memorial tablet in the Chen Village during a ceremony in 1990. This tablet recounts the history of the Chen‚Äôs Martial Art and lists his name among the most high- ranking practitioners of the style. During these travels Gene also trained additionally in Wu-style taijiquan with Master Wang Peisheng, and spent time learning from Chen Yuxia (Daughter of Chen Fake) and Hong Junsheng as well. Return to teaching Gene formed the Chen‚Äôs Tai Chi Association USA in 1982. For many years his school would meet in the evenings at the Fort Mason Center and on the weekends in Golden Gate Park. He taught a complete curriculum including the first and second sets, qigong, pushing hands, weapons, the 8 energies, philosophy and history. He placed a special emphasis on developing root, peng and a proper centerline in all the moves of the set. In the martial practice, he emphasized using an undetectable interception, catching of the opponent‚Äôs energy and unbalancing them before issuing fa jin. His teachings went far beyond just martial arts, however. Gene referred to Taiji as the art of all arts - an art that was based on the very principles of nature. Whether it was playing basketball, buying clothing or sitting down to eat dim sum, he would always give something of the Taiji philosophy. Through his embodiment and explanation of the Taiji philosophy, he taught things that could be applied to daily life: how to flow gracefully with the ups and downs of life and to enjoy the simple pleasures along the way. He taught that in life, nothing is 100%, for everything changes, and even the most desperate situation contains a seed of growth and hope. It was always a goal of Gene‚Äôs to write a book about Chen‚Äôs Taiji, to help explain its history and principles to a Western audience. Working with a group of students, he did put together and outline of the book and a series of extensive lecture notes that would serve as the chapters, but he ultimately never finished the project. Throughout the years he did however have multiple articles published in national martial arts magazines including, Inside Kung Fu, the Tai Chi Journal and China Sport.

The party's ideas were influenced by political theorist Murray Bookchin's idea of libertarian municipalism. Origins The party that eventually became Ecology Montreal was started in 1989 through a series of public meetings organized by Dimitri Roussopoulos, a veteran political organizer and publisher in Montreal. Roussopoulos indicated that his group was intended to become Montreal's first municipal Green party and would make environmental issues its top priority.Lewis Harris, \\"City hall opposition (such as it is) ponders alliances in bid for clout,\\" Montreal Gazette, 11 November 1989, B4; Paul Wells, \\"He is planning a party to paint city hall green; Introducing...Dimitri Roussopoulos,\\" Montreal Gazette, 24 December 1989, A2. Ecology Montreal was formally registered with city hall in April 1990.\\"New party focuses on environment,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 April 1990, A3. The party was established at about the same time as the Democratic Coalition of Montreal, a left-wing breakaway group from the governing Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM). Roussopoulos held talks with Democratic Coalition leaders on inter-party co- operation in late 1989, although no agreement was reached at that time.Lewis Harris, \\"Four ex-MCM rebels form new party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 December 1989, A3. In October 1990, the parties signed a \\"non-aggression pact,\\" pledging not to run against one another in most of the city's council wards in the upcoming election. As a result of the pact, Ecology Montreal did not field a candidate for mayor.Lewis Harris, \\"Coalition, Ecology parties have \`non- aggression pact',\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 October 1990, A5. 1990 election Ecology Montreal's platform for the 1990 municipal election included calls for reducing automobile use, increasing green space, a full recycling program, proportional representation, and a toll for cars entering the Island of Montreal with fewer than three people.James Mennie, \\"City must think green, party says; Montreal Ecologique targets 20 \`serious' ridings,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 October 1990, A3; \\"Change our voting,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 September 1990, B2. During the election, Roussopoulos said that Montreal should reduce its garbage output by seventy per cent.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Environment issues get slight attention; MCM failed to fulfil promises critics and opponents charge,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 October 1990, A6. Some party members also pledged to set up a food bank after the election, expressing surprise at the degree of poverty in the city.\\"Campaign offers food for thought,\\" Edmonton Journal, 4 November 1990, A4. Ecology Montreal ran twenty-one candidates in the 1990 election, none of whom were elected. Roussopoulos finished second to an MCM candidate in the Jeanne-Mance ward.Marian Scott, \\"Losing parties vow to keep fighting city hall; Mayoral vote count gives official opposition status to Municipal Party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 November 1990, A3.

Before the merger, the party had attempted to form \\"Alliance '94\\", a political alliance with two other leftist city councillors. The merged party won two seats on council, both of whom were former members of the Democratic Coalition.

During the Second World War (1941-1945) Sol Duc served as a barracks ship. Design and constructions Following the loss of the nearly- new but wooden steamship Clallam in 1904, Joshua Green, president of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, owner of the Clallam and the dominant Puget Sound shipping concern, announced that the company would replace its wooden steamships with ones built of steel. As part of this effort, the steel steamers Sol Duc and Potlatch. were built simultaneously in Seattle by the Seattle Construction and Drydock Company. Sol Duc was specifically designed for the Seattle ‚Äì Port Townsend-Port Angeles-Port Crescent route. Sol Duc was the largest steamship built to that date for the Puget Sound Navigation Company. Although similar in appearance to Potlatch, at 1,085 gross tons, Sol Duc almost twice as large. Dimensions for Sol Duc were length beam of and depth of hold of . Power was supplied by a triple-expansion compound steam engine with cylinder diameters, from high pressure to low pressure, of , and , with piston strokes on all cylinders of . Steam was generated by two oil-fired water-tube boilers at 225 pounds pressure, with the overall power plant generating .Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at 204, 336, 386, 406, 508 and 557. The unusual name of the steamer was chosen to tie in to Michael Earles new health spa located at the Sol Duc hot springs in the foothills of the Olympic Mountains. Operation In addition to the Seattle-Port Townsend-Port Angeles-Port Crescent route, Sol Duc also made runs across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Victoria, British Columbia. The vessel was unfortunately prone to roll excessively when encountering rough weather in the strait. In the summer of 1928, Sol Duc was replaced on the Olympic route with the Iroquois which had been rebuilt as a ferry. Sol Duc and other steamships could transport automobiles, but only as freight. This meant that cars had to be partially dismantled, such as having the tires removed, so that they could fit into the hold.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at 60, 81, 83, 131, 178, 181-82, 213, and 249. In 1929, Sol Duc replaced Kulshan on the Seattle-Bellingham run, only running as a night freight boat. Sol Duc stayed on this run until November 1935. A strike forced Puget Sound Navigation Co. to stop operating Sol Duc and other vessels. After the strike was over, the company took Sol Duc out of service. One of the captains of Sol Duc was Harry Carter (1858-1930), who had also commanded State of Washington and a number of other well-known vessels. Another captain of Sol Duc was J. Howard Payne (1889-1956), who in 1917 at the age of 24 was in command of the vessel on the Seattle-Port Angeles-Victoria route. Payne later became a member of the Washington State Legislature.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at 617. Final years Unlike Potlatch and other steel steamers, Sol Duc was not scrapped in the late 1930s. In 1942, Sol Duc was taken over by the U.S. Navy and for use as a barracks ship, and renamed YHB-8, meaning ‚Äúself-propelled houseboat no. 8.‚Äù After World War II, Sol Duc was sold to Freeman & Gibson, a Seattle firm.

Ireland‚Äôs agri-food sector encompasses primary production (agriculture, fishing and forestry) as well as food, beverage and horticulture production and wood processing. According to the most recently available annual data (2018) from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), employment in the agri-food sector accounts for approximately 173,000 jobs or 7.7% of total employment in Ireland. History The story of Bord Bia began with an idea that came from Joe Walsh, born in May 1943 in Ballineen, County Cork, who was appointed as senior Minister for Agriculture and Food in 1992 . His rationale for the creation of Bord Bia was simple, compelling and formidable and that rationale persuaded the state to re-write the statute book and to legally create and form Bord Bia, The Irish Food Board. As such, Bord Bia was established under the An Bord Bia Act 1994, to promote, assist, and develop in any manner which Bord Bia considers necessary or desirable the marketing of Irish food and livestock and the production, marketing and consumption of horticultural product. The Act brought together the former CBF (C√≥ras Beostoic agus Feola - the Irish Meat and Livestock Board) and the food promotion activities of An Bord Tr√°cht√°la/the Irish Trade Board, now part of Enterprise Ireland. in July 2004 Bord Glas, the Irish Horticulture Board, ceased to exist and was formally merged with An Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board. In June 2009, the act was amended to include responsibility for seafood promotion in domestic and international markets. Organisation Bord Bia is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, and as of 2020, has 15 international offices including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan, Dusseldorf, Stockholm, Warsaw, Moscow, Dubai, Lagos, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo and New York. Bord Bia, who reports to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, comprises of the board, five subsidiary boards (meat and livestock, dairy, horticulture, consumer foods and quality assurance), the Chief Executive and the Executive. Tara McCarthy is the current Chief Executive of Bord Bia and brings with her over 20 years‚Äô experience in the wider food industry. She was previously Chief Executive for Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), Ireland‚Äôs seafood development agency and has operated in overseas markets for 10 years including Germany, France and Belgium. Tara holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from UCG with an MBS in Marketing from Smurfit Business School and is an affiliate of IMD Business School, Switzerland. Tara was awarded Fellowship of the Marketing Institute of Ireland in September 2018. In April 2019 Tara was awarded UCD Michael Smurfit School of Business‚Äô Outstanding Alumnus Award. Bord Bia Bloom Bord Bia Bloom has become one of Ireland‚Äôs largest showcases celebrating the best of Irish horticulture, food and drink. Originally created to promote plants, garden design, horticulture and gardening, Bord Bia‚Äôs role in promoting food and drink has allowed Bloom to develop further. The show has grown into something which not only makes for a great day out, but also offers a huge range of practical information on everything from gardening, to growing fruit and vegetables, cooking and culture. Bloom spans over 70 acres in the Phoenix Park and in 2019 showcased 22 show gardens,14 postcard gardens, some 50 floral and botanical art displays, 160 retailers, over 100 food and drink producers and more than 100 live talks, demonstrations and family friendly activities.

Origin Green  Bord Bia launched Origin Green, the world‚Äôs first national sustainability programme, in 2012. The programme is built on the pre-existing Quality Assurance programme, and encourages sustainability in manufacturing plants, retailers and food service businesses. An increasing number of Irish farmers and manufacturers are recognising that improved sustainability practices are good for business too. Sustainable farming and efficient farming go hand in hand and can also preserve your farm business and the environment for future generations. The plan is independently verified by international inspection, testing and verification specialists, to ensure the targets are viable and robust. Each plan is reviewed annually and monitored for progress against the set targets.  Bord Bia Talent Academy  The Bord Bia Talent Academy offers a range of world-leading post-graduate opportunities.

Origins The P√âBM was created by Michel B√©dard in August 1989, with the stated purpose of giving Montrealers an alternative in the 1990 municipal election. A party spokesperson said that it would \\"half humorous, half serious\\" and \\"use humor to make a serious point.\\" Although similar in some respects to the Rhinoceros Party of Canada and the Parti citron, it was not formally aligned with those parties.\\"White elephants weigh in,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 August 1989, A3; James Mennie, \\"Elephant Party suffers from mistaken identity; \`We're more ferocious than Rhinos',\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 October 1990, A4. Campaigns The P√âBM ran B√©dard as its mayoral candidate in the 1990 municipal election and fielded a number of candidates for the Montreal city council. The party's election literature was filled with puns and jokes, including a pledge to use its tusks to skewer \\"elected officials who never open their mouths except to yawn and never stand except to go to the bathroom.\\" This notwithstanding, B√©dard also focused on poverty and hunger issues, promising to start a line of government-owned restaurants to feed the poor with surplus foods from restaurants and bakeries.James Mennie, \\"Hunger isn't funny; White Elephants are serious about election issues: leader,\\" Montreal Gazette, 8 September 1990, A3. During the election, the P√âBM also promised to turn parking lots into green spaces, ban neon signs and advertisements on bus terminals, and increase heritage protection.Marian Scott, \\"Party blueprints,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 October 1990, B1. The party again fielded B√©dard as its mayoral candidate in the 1994 municipal election, in which capacity he presided over total party electoral budget of only one thousand dollars. During this campaign, B√©dard described the party's name as follows: \\"The white elephant is the only animal that doesn't fear its rivals because it is thought to be the wisest and most serene animal of all. It's a symbol of prosperity, security and confidence, all of which are very important qualities in a political party. And the color of the animal we have chosen as our symbol is white, because we are still pure. We are not corrupt like many other political parties out there.\\"Taskeen Hamidullah, \\"Trumpeting its virtues; White Elephant Party aims to shake up voters,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 August 1994, A3.

The Weld-Blundell Prism is a clay, cuneiform inscribed vertical prism housed in the Ashmolean Museum. The prism was found in a 1922 expedition by british archaeologist Herbert Weld Blundell. The four sides, about 20 cm high and 9 cm wide, are inscribed in the Sumerian language with lists of Sumerian kings; each side contains the text in two columns: this is the famous Sumerian King List. The list begins with the antediluvian rulers and ends with Sin-magir of the Isin dynasty (r. 1827‚Äì1817). The list was most likely written in Sin-magir's final year, or soon after. Many, especially antediluvian, kings are credited with incredibly long reigns (counted in sars and nerah), as a result of which many scholars consider this work to be more artistic than historical. Various theories are being constructed in an attempt to explain such large numbers. They are supposed to express the great importance of rulers who were considered semi- gods . According to another version, sar (3600 years) and ner (600 years), the units of time measurement in the Sumerian number system , should be taken as years and months, respectively.

During his term in the country, he tried to give the Islands a government as good as that of modern Spain. He traveled through many provinces trying to learn the needs of Filipinos. He encouraged agriculture, improved the streets and suburbs of Manila, and succeeded in helping the country.Jernegan, Prescott Ford (1905) \\"A short history of the Philippines: for use in Philippine schools\\". pp. 232-234.

Lakay-Lakay, Official Claveria Website. Retrieved on 2011-06-03. His grandson, Narciso Claver√≠a y de Palacios, 3rd Count of Manila, was an architect who designed the Toledo Railway Station. Early years Narciso Claver√≠a was a native of the Catalonian city of Girona, whose mother was of Basque origin. He became a member of Spain's General Staff in 1838, colonel in 1839, and lieutenant general in 1844. He became governor of the Philippines on July 16, 1844. Acts as Governor-General of the Philippines =Reformation of the Philippine calendar= The Philippines from 1521 to 1844 was one day behind the calendars of Asia, Europe and America. When Ferdinand Magellan sailed west around the world, he lost a few minutes every day. He was going the same way the sun was going, so his day ended later than that of the people who remained in Europe. Therefore, he was later in beginning the next day. By the time he reached the Philippines, he was a day behind Europe on his date. This error had been known for centuries. Finally, Claver√≠a and the Archbishop of Manila agreed to remove Tuesday, December 31, 1844 from the Philippine calendar. So the day after Monday, December 30, 1844 was called Wednesday, January 1, 1845. =Surnames for Filipinos= From the days of the Spanish conquest, some Filipinos had received Spanish surnames. Most people, however, had no surnames, which caused confusion. On Wednesday, November 21, 1849, Claver√≠a issued a decree sending a long lists of Spanish and local surnames to the chiefs of the provinces. These were sent out to the different towns, and given to the locals who had no surnames. In many towns, all the names for people in that town began with the same letter of the alphabet. For instance, surnames starting with \\"A\\" applies for those who lived in Alimodian while those starting \\"M\\" apply for those who lived in Miagao. =First steamships in the Philippines= The first steam-powered warships to sail regularly in Philippine waters were the Magallanes, Elcano, and Reina de Castilla. They were brought from London in 1848. These steamships were of great value because now it was possible to chase and capture the swift boats of the Moro pirates from the South who used to raid the coastal villages north of them. =Spanish expedition to Balanguingui= Claver√≠a organised an amphibious campaign against the pirates of the Samal Islands. He destroyed several towns and forts on the island of Balanguingui, between the islands of Basilan and Jolo, and released one hundred and thirty Filipino and Dutch captives (from Java) in 1848. For this successful military operation he received the titles of Count of Manila and Viscount of Claver√≠a, and received the Knight Grand Cross of Royal and Military Order of San Fernando from Queen Isabella II, besides other rewards. =Reforming the governors of the provinces= From the earliest days, the chief of a province had acted both as governor and judge. He also engaged in trade, of which he had a monopoly. With the duties of three men to perform, it was not strange that the governors were often poor rulers. They knew little of the law and therefore they sent all the important cases to Manila. For this reason there were often long delays in processing cases. Sometimes it required years to get justice and this encouraged the strong to oppress the weak. Claver√≠a therefore ordered that the governors be men of two years experience in the law. Claver√≠a mandated that the governors should not engage in trade. This decree was not fully obeyed for many years after the time of Claver√≠a. At that time there were thirty-one provinces. The governor received a salary of from three hundred to two thousand Philippine pesos a year. The most common salary was six hundred pesos. In return for the privilege of controlling the trade of the provinces the governors paid the government as high as three thousand pesos a year. Yet they usually became rich. Men of high position tried to get these places. Sometimes they returned to Spain with fortunes, after a few years as governor. Often these fortunes were made by dealing unjustly or because of the monopoly they exerted in certain areas. =Other acts during his term= A casino called \\"Sociedad de recreo\\" (\\" Recreation Association \\") was established on Thursday, October 31, 1844. His proposal to establish military library was approved on Sunday, February 15, 1846. A monument to Ferdinand Magellan was erected on the south bank of the Pasig River in 1848. The regular clergy were forbidden to alienate property on Monday, January 15, 1849. His term was marked by intense activity, and a number of papers were founded, among them being the first daily newspaper of Manila, La Esperanza (Tuesday, December 1, 1846), and Diario de Manila (1848).Blair, Emma Helen and Robertson, James Alexander (1904). \\"The Philippine Islands 1493-1803, Vol.17\\", pp. 304-305. The Arthur H. Clark Co., Cleveland, OH. Return to Spain In 1849, Claver√≠a requested that he be allowed to retire. After which he left the position of governor-general and returned to Spain. He was a man of culture, probity, and industry. He was made a senator in 1850 but died the following year on June 20 in Madrid.Ruiz, Angel Salcedo (1914). \\"Historia de Espa√±a\\", p.715.

He took the pseudonyms Heinrich Scham and Ernst Deutsch. Life He was born the son of Friedrich Pudor, director of the Royal Conservatory in Dresden. Pudor initially studied music at the Dresden Kreuzschule and then at the conservatory. In 1886-87 he studied physiological psychology, philosophy and art history at the University of Leipzig, then moved to the University of Heidelberg, where he researched Schopenhauer's metaphysics of music and ideas, graduating in 1889. Before his father's death, when he took over his position as leader of the conservatory, he travelled in France and Italy. His travel sketches were published in 1893 and 1895, establishing his reputation as a travel writer. He later published similar descriptions of Scandinavian countries. When inaugurated as head of the Dresden conservatory, he came to the decision only to teach German music. This was vehemently criticized by the teachers and the Dresden government; consequently, Pudor sold his interest the conservatory in June 1890. With the proceeds, he founded his own publishing firm (in Munich, Berlin, and later New York City), publishing only his own writings, mainly books of poetry and self- help wherein he advocated Lebensreform ideas. He moved to a villa in Loschwitz and married a Jewish woman, Susanne Jacobi in 1891, divorcing her seven years later. In 1892 his columns started to appear in the Dresden Weekly for Art and Culture. His family moved to London in 1893, shortly before the publication of his Naked People. Rejoice in the Future was the first German book about naturism. Pudor had adopted vegetarianism two years before his move to London. In the following years, he published many works on lifestyle as well as other themes (architecture, linguistics, social policy, and cultural studies). In 1898 he tried in vain to re-establish himself as a painter, sculptor, and musician, travelling extensively through Europe and returning to Germany. In Berlin, he married Linda Prill (the marriage lasted until 1923). In 1907 he published his travel descriptions of Scandinavian countries, also moving in that year to Leipzig. In 1910, he discovered handicraft, and founded the \\"Protective Order for German Quality Work.\\" (Schutzverband f√ºr deutsche Qualit√§tsarbeit) One year later he established the journal \\"Unfair Competition: Communications of the Association for the protection of German Quality Work\\". In 1906 he published a book on bisexuality. From 1912 onward, Pudor issued almost exclusively anti-Semitic writings, mostly self-published. A prelude to this was the book, Germany for Germans. Next was Preliminary work on Laws against the Jewish Settlement in Germany and a publication, Antisemitic Armor of the German People's Council (in 1918 he also issued True German: News from the German People's Council. The People's Council was probably a creation of Pudor's). The journal was banned in 1915, and he renamed it the Iron Ring with issues continuing until 1923. Pudor's many publications irritated several politicians and led to many appearances in court. After he threatened liberal politician Gustav Stresemann with murder in his Treacherous Foreign Policy he was fined and imprisoned for a year on March 17, 1926. Nazi period In September 1933 Pudor's magazine Swastika was banned for having criticized the leadership cult around Hitler in the Nazi party. He also mourned their \\"toleration\\" of Jews and attacked the new Nazi leaders' origins and lifestyle (including Hitler and Goebbels). From November 14, 1933 to July 5, 1934 he was placed in protective custody because the magazine had continued to spread after the official ban. After his imprisonment among socialists and communists, Pudor published many autobiographical writings in which he portrayed himself as a pioneer of the German nationalist movement. In 1943 he was again investigated for selling banned books (his older writings), but he died before the investigation was completed.

History Guadalupe Valley was originally called Ca√±ada de Guadalupe, and was part of the Rancho Ca√±ada de Guadalupe la Visitaci√≥n y Rodeo Viejo land grant awarded by General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo to his brother-in-law, Jacob P. Leese in 1841. Prior to this Manuel Sanchez had petitioned for the rancho of this name in 1835. Watershed and course The Guadalupe Creek watershed begins on the northeast slope of the peak of San Bruno Mountain as Devil's Arroyo, which descends quickly northwards to the head of the Guadalupe Valley. The confluence of Devil's Arroyo and Wax Myrtle Ravine is at the head of the Guadalupe Valley at elevation 200 feet, where the Guadalupe Creek mainstem flows eastward largely confined to underground pipes and ditches, emerging to daylight just east of Bayshore Boulevard. From there it flows for a few dozen yards to its mouth in Brisbane Lagoon. This lagoon is a remnant of San Francisco Bay, formed by the construction of the U. S. Highway 101 causeway, and became diminished when its north and central portions (which are now crossed by Visitacion Creek) were filled with garbage and landfill. Seasonal creeks which contribute to the Guadalupe Creek watershed include Owl Canyon and Buckeye Canyon. After passing into the lagoon, the waters of the Guadalupe Valley watershed pass through a culvert under the freeway into the Bay. Aerial view of Guadalupe Quarry.

Plot In New York City, Rosalind Dee (DeCarlo) is a secretary longing to enter high society. She's rumored of being Carlton Hammond's mistress; he's an older, wealthy man, who dies of a heart attack. Evelyn Hammond, his wife and an invalid, sees her at his funeral. She summons her to the family home and gifts Rosalind $100,000 for making her husband happy. Despite protests, Rosalind takes the money. Rosalind quits her job, determined to make something of herself. That evening, she goes to a dinner-dance with her friend Wade Evans (Zachary Scott). Gambling-club owner Cyril Mace (Kurt Kasznar) joins their table and tries to talk Wade into investing in his Nassau club. Rosalind's intrigued by Cyril's colorful descriptions of an elite, high society club and casino by the ocean, so she inquires about Cyril's plans with Wade. The couple flies to Nassau with Cyril as their guide, tour the island and the club, and meet Rev. Kelly Rand (James Arness), who also takes tourists fishing. Rosalind invests $75,000, and Wade invests $20,000. Cyril meets with his Cuban partners, informing him that they have two American partners, too. They're nervous, but Cyril assures them that he'll keep the Americans away, and that they'll all make money. Rand takes Rosalind marlin fishing. When she lands one, Rand kisses her \\"as a prize.\\" On dock, Cyril's waiting with some newly arrived, rich Americans, who've come to admire her catch; he introduces her to them. Playboy Doug Duryea (Howard Duff) is there, too, flustering Rosalind, particularly when he asks if they met on Nassau last year. At home, Rosalind confides in Wade that, when she was 15, she and Doug were in love; her name was Linda Darcy. She was poor, he was wealthy, and his family separated them. She still loves him, but he doesn't remember her. She invested in the club because she was sure that Doug would visit, and she's hoping for a second chance. Wade asks her what she'll do if Doug doesn't fall in love with her; Rosalind replies that he will. The club opens to a full house with Rosalind as hostess and a popular singer/dancer. Doug introduces his mother, Mrs Charmaine Duryea, to Rosalind; Doug takes Rosalind aside, saying that she's the woman for whom he's been waiting. Charmaine has a heart spasm, caused by excitement at gambling. While recovering, she asks to see Rosalind. Charmaine says she opposes Doug marrying a second time, as he's now her companion. Back in the club, a tipsy Wade informs Doug that Rosalind's really Linda Darcy. Doug's amazed that Rosalind's Linda, and they embrace joyously. They spend even more time together, causing Cyril to grumble that it's in bad taste of her to spend her time with only one club member. The couple attend Rand's Sunday, beach-side sermon, which Rosalind finds very inspirational. Doug invites Rosalind to his house for Christmas, over her protests that Charmaine won't like it. Cyril gives her an expensive necklace, and tries to kiss her passionately. Rosalind shoves him away over his protests that she'll find Doug's party dull. While taking Rosalind to Doug's house, Rand warns Rosalind away from club, saying that Cyril isn't any good. At the Duryea's, Doug tells his mother that Rosalind is actually Linda, and that he loves her; she's horrified. During the party, Doug and Rosalind become engaged. Charmaine nearly faints when her friend informs her, but manages to congratulate them. Evelyn Hammond arrives, recognizing Rosalind, and Doug says that Evelyn's his god-mother. Evelyn says that she wishes to speak with Rosalind that day, and Rosalind finds Evelyn in a sitting room later. They argue, Evelyn indignant that Rosalind took her money and husband's love and now's after her godson, and Rosalind saying that the family bought her off twice, including when she was young and pregnant, but now she's doing all she can with the means to do it. Evelyn threatens to tell Doug, but Rosalind says it won't matter; he'll choose her. Aghast, Evelyn tells Charmaine that Rosalind was Carlton's lover and promises to tell Doug. While giving Rand his Christmas presents, Rand kisses Rosalind, impulsively. She tells him she's engaged, but he's forgiven as it's Christmas. He approves of her engagement, as it means she'll leave the club. Upon her return, Charmaine's waiting for Rosalind in her suite and asks what Rosalind and Carlton were to each other. Charmaine breaks down, saying that Carlton loved her, but couldn't leave Evelyn. Rosalind says that they didn't love each other or have an affair. Charmaine makes Rosalind promise never to tell Doug about her affair with Carlton, then dies from an attack, despite Rosalind calling for a doctor. Evelyn tries to tell Doug about Rosalind's past, but he refuses to hear, going to Rosalind's suite. He asks what caused his mother's attack. Rosalind tells him that Charmaine was upset that about the rumors that she was Carlton's mistress; she took the Hammond's money as she thinks they owed it to her. She refuses to tell Doug the identity of his godfather's mistress. He leaves in anger, failing to have the \\"proof\\" he needs, and Evelyn spreads her rumors. Club members stop attending, due to the scandal. On the day of the funeral, Rosalind goes to Rand's house and drinks. He arrives at home when she's falling down drunk and sits her in a chair to sober up. That afternoon, she talks with Doug. He's talked with Evelyn, who doesn't believe Rosalind's story. He's uncertain over who to believe, but when she refuses to confirm/deny her story, he decides that Rosalind was Carlton's mistress after all. She sends back his engagement ring. Cyril's Cuban partners are agitated that the club's losing money and summon Rosalind to Cyril's office. Despite her surprise that they exist, she agrees to negotiate. The men offer to buy her out with the expectation that she'll leave tomorrow. She says that they couldn't pay for the type of publicity that she's brought them, so they should open it up to the general public and offer her a written contract for more money; they'll all make a fortune. They decide to talk it over, and Rosalind and Cyril walk back to her suite. Cyril then offers Rosalind a deal where she seduces men, takes their money, and they all profit; she laughs at him. He kisses her again, despite her repulsion. Wade walks in, pulling Cyril away, and is beaten by Cyril. Wade collapses, informing her and the partners that Cyril's been using two sets of books to cheat both sets of partners. His furious partners take Cyril away. Cyril insists their money's in his safe, but pulls out a flare gun instead. He shoots it out the window, alerting the Coast Guard. His partners kill him and kidnap Rosalind, heading to their boat and running into Rand on the beach. Rand fights them, but's overwhelmed and is taken, too. They're kept below- decks, while the partners sail to Cuba. Alerted by the flare, the Coast Guard rushes after their boat and fires on it; Rand sabotages their engine to slow it down. Rosalind and Rand sneak overboard while the partners' boat explodes from shots fired by the Coast Guard. They swim to an island and walk ashore, Rosalind telling him that she wants to stay. They embrace.

It is displayed in the Louvre Museum of Paris, France. History The painting was the fourth commissioned by Isabella d'Este for her studiolo, after two canvasses by Andrea Mantegna (Parnassus and the Triumph of the Virtues, respectively from 1497 and 1499-1502) and Perugino's Combat of Love and Chastity (1503). The subject was provided by the court poet Paride of Ceresara and was initially assigned to Mantegna. However, after the latter's death in 1506, he was replaced by Lorenzo Costa, who deleted all the work made by his predecessor. Isabella liked the painting, and this granted Costa the position as the new court painter of the Gonzaga of Mantua. Duke Charles I of Nevers gifted this and the other paintings in the studiolo to Cardinal Richelieu, and the Allegory thus went to Paris. After belonging to several collections, it became part of the collections of the Louvre Museum. Description The most accepted interpretation of the painting is an exaltation of Isabella d'Este, her rule and her role as patron of the arts, which generates harmony. She would be the figure in the center, crowned with laurel by Anteros, who is held by his mother, Venus: the two mythological figures would symbolize the heavenly and virtuous love, compared to the earthly and carnal one. The scene would be in the garden of Harmony, where it is possible to freely practice Music, Arts and Poetry, which are referred to by the characters surrounding the coronation. In the foreground, behind the garden's boundaries, are Diana, symbol of chastity, and Cadmus (on the left), protectors of the arts such as Mercury, identified by the scene of battle behind him on the painting's left. The two female characters sitting on the ground are identifiable with the Virtues who watch over Isabella's world: the one crowning the ox would be Perseverance, the one crowning the lamb would be Purity or Innocence. Another interpretation is that based on the Tabula Cebetis: the painting would represent the different genres of poetry, the foremost of which is lyrics, portrayed by Venus in the center. The character being crowned would be Sappho, and the personifications around her would be outstanding early lyricists such as Callimachus, Propertius, Ovid and Tibullus.

The principal difference was that the EC.4 had an all-wood structure whereas the ED.5 was all-metal. Both were single-engine, mid-wing cantilever monoplanes. Design and development In the 1930s the veteran aircraft designer Louis B√©chereau set up Avions Kellner- B√©chereau, a collaboration with the well-known automobile coach builders Kellner. In 1936‚Äì37 this company built a short series of small monoplanes exploiting one of B√©chereau's patents, a full span lateral division of the wing into two sections forming a \\"double wing\\", a little like that used by Junkers but with a more equal division of area. The wing was first tested on the single-seat Kellner-B√©chereau E.1 on 1936, which was followed by two larger and more powerful two-seaters, the EC.4 and ED.5. Both of these were designed to meet the French Air Ministry's requirement for a pre-military trainer aircraft to be used by the clubs set up in the \\"Aviation Populaire\\" programme. Like the E.1, the EC.4 was a wooden aircraft with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, thick section, constant chord wings of quite high aspect ratio (9.45). The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined to the front with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts. The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, with an open cockpit seating two side by side at the wing trailing edge and an inverted in-line 40 kW (60 hp) Train T6 in the nose. A straight edged tailplane was mounted on the upper fuselage longerons and carried elevators with a small cut-out for rudder movement. The latter, mounted on a very narrow fin, was rectangular and extended to the bottom of the fuselage. The rear control surfaces were fabric covered. The EC.4 had a conventional undercarriage with cantilever main legs hinged on the lower longerons, rubber sprung inside the fuselage. The second design, the ED.5 was similar to the EC.4 except that it was a metal aircraft. The forward part of the wing and the whole fuselage were constructed in a process also patented by B√©chereau. It involved the use of wooden formers, shaped to the required skin profile but with cut-outs for strengthening members such as ribs. These were placed into the mould before the duralumin skin was fitted over the former and held down with leather belts. Once secured, the internal pieces and skin could be joined, still in the mould, by screws or rivets. The rear wing surfaces were also metal, though more conventionally built. The dimensions of the EC.4 and ED.5 were the same, as were seating, engine and undercarriage. The loaded weight of the metal aircraft was 25 kg (55 lb) lower. Performance was similar, with identical maximum speeds; the lighter ED.5 had a 5 km/h (3 mph) lower stalling speed but a 55 km (35 mi) shorter range. The Kellner-B√©chereau designs were not ordered for the Aviation Populaire programme, the Air Ministry preferring the Caudron C.270 and the Salmson Cri-Cri which were both bought in large numbers. Instead, Kellner-B√©chereau, along with other manufacturers, built the Cri-Cri under licence.

It was built starting in 1267 and houses, among the rest, the Bentivoglio Chapel, featuring numerous Renaissance artworks. History A community of hermits founded by the Blessed John the Good of Modena had established itself near the walls of Bologna, along the Savena river, as early as 1247. They founded a monastery with its church, dedicated to St. James the Greater (). The hermits were merged in 1256 by the pope with other eremetical communities of the region to form the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine, with one of their number being elected the first Prior General of the new Order. As they then needed a larger religious complex within the walls, in 1267 construction was undertaken of the new church in the present location. The edifice was finished in 1315, but its consecration took place in 1344, with the completion of the apse section. The church, built in sober Romanesque style (with some Gothic elements such as the ogival windows), had a single nave with visible trusses and ended with a polygonal apse-chapel and two square chapel. In the 15th century the Bentivoglio family built their family chapel in the church (1463‚Äì1468), and also added a long portico on the Via San Donato (1477‚Äì1481). Across the church is the flank of the 1560 Palazzo Malvezzi de' Medici, Bologna. In 1471 the bell tower was raised and, from 1483 to 1498, the interior was largely renovated with a new cover and a dome. New chapels were created in the side walls, which were eventually decorated with Renaissance and Baroque altars and paintings. The Augustinian friars were expelled during the French occupation in the early 19th century. They returned in 1824, although part of the monastery remained a music school, now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini. With the anti-clerical laws again suppressing religious orders legislated by the new Kingdom of Italy, the friars gave up the monastery, keeping only possession of the church. Description Apse and bell tower. =Exterior= The facade is the oldest part of the church, with its late-Romanesque proportions. The decorations in Istrian stone on the ogival windows, in Venetian style, were added by Lombardy masters in 1295. The four funerary cells were added in the early 14th century, shortly after those in the portico, which date to the 13th century and had frescoes (now inside the church); the original entrance protyrus was modified in the same period. The Triumph over Death by Lorenzo Costa the Elder (1490). The portico, traditionally attributed to Tommaso Filippi, had 36 Corinthian columns. The entablature has a frieze. The portico also gives access to two cloisters, one from the 15th and another the 16th century. The complex is bounded by the only surviving section of Bologna's 11th-century walls. Next to them is the Oratory of Santa Cecilia within the monastery cloister. The oratory includes frescoed panels by the Renaissance painters Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa, and Amico Aspertini. The 15th-century portico built by the Bentivoglio family and the bell tower. The church has a Renaissance dome designed by Antonio Morandi. =Interior= The interior has Renaissance and Baroque decorations. The vaults have frescoes executed in 1495 by Francia and Lorenzo Costa's workshops. There are numerous chapels: the main ones include the Poggi Chapel, with artworks by Pellegrino Tibaldi, and the Bentivoglio Chapel. Bentivoglio Chapel This element of the basilica was designed by Pagno di Lapo Portigiani (1463‚Äì1468). It has a majolica pavement by the Della Robbia workshop (1498), with traces of the Bentivoglio coat of arms. The painted decoration was executed by Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and includes the Bentivoglio Altarpiece. The altarpiece is by Francesco Raibolini (c. 1494). The tomb of Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio was sculpted by Jacopo della Quercia in 1438. Poggi Chapel This chapel was built by Cardinal Giovanni Poggi (1493-1556), a native of the city, who is buried in it. Poggi met Pellegrino Tibaldi, also a native of Bologna, after the painter had moved to Rome in 1547, and later commissioned him to paint the Palazzo Poggi in their hometown. Tibaldi returned to the city in 1555 and painted frescoes for the cardinal in both his palace and the family chapel. This work is considered Tibaldi's masterpiece. In this chapel there are two portraits by Tibaldi of the cardinal, one on each side of the altar. The one on the left shows him as papal nuncio to Spain, while the one on the right shows him later in his career, as a cardinal. Other Other artworks include Polyptych of the Holy Cross Relic by Paolo Veneziano, a Virgin in Glory by Bartolomeo Cesi (late 16th century), and an early 15th-century late Gothic crucifix in the Malvezzi Chapel.

Khadda has been considered to be among the founders of contemporary Algerian painting and one of the many representatives of the \\"sign painters.\\" He debuted in 1960. His influences included Cubism and Arabic calligraphy. He tended toward the non-figurative or abstract.\\"M√©moire de signes: l'abstraction chez Jean-Michel Atlan et Mohammed Khadda\\" in the French Review He represented a generation of Algerian artists who combined the ideas of calligraphic heritage and formal language of Western formal writing through Western abstraction through the 1950s.  Biography  Born in Mostaganem, Mohammed Khadda was the eldest of five children, two of whom died while infants. His father, Bendehiba Khadda, was born in 1912 in the town of Mina and moved to Mostaganem at a very young age. He was born blind, yet held various occupations such as a bricklayer and a dock worker. Khadda‚Äôs mother, Nebi El Ghali was born in 1911 in Zemora, Algeria, a city near Tiaret. When she was a little girl, her parents were murdered by a settler tribe near where she lived. She, like Mohammed‚Äôs father, was also blind, but managed to adjust. Benedehiba and Nebi met in Mostaganem and were married in 1929. In 1936, Mohammed Khadda attended a school in Tigditt, Mostaganem in an Arab neighborhood. In 1942, he and his family had to leave Mostaganem because of a famine in the area. The family moved to Tiaret and they moved in with his aunt. It was miserable there because their aunt couldn‚Äôt provide for them due to her age. Three months later, he returned to Mostaganem and he went back to school. In 1943, he received a diploma from the school. His father wanted him to get a job as soon as he received his diploma, but one of his teachers gave him a year of respite so he did not have to settle for a job he did not enjoy. In 1944, Khadda found a job at a printing company called ‚ÄúAin Sefra.‚Äù During the day, Khadda would draw and make sketches for the printing company. He decided to take on a second job in the evening, binding books for different writers such as Omar Khayyam, Abdou Mohammed, Taha Hussein, Hafid, Jami, Andr√© Gide, Andr√© Breton, and Jean Cocteau. During the years of resistance against the French, many artists including Khadda went and fought for the National Liberation Army. After finishing with the army, he settled down and his career as an artist slowly began.  Art  Often working with a palette of earth tones, Khadda created tactile compositions that layer Arabic writing and calligraphy over atmospheric abstract canvases. For the most part, Mohammed Khadda was a self-taught painter of abstract compositions. He used Arabic characters and signs taken from Berber tattoos in his artwork. Though he was self-taught for part of his life, he also had connections with art schools. In 1947, Khadda met Abdallah Benantaur, an artist born in Mostaganem a year after Khadda was born. After their encounter, Khadda enrolled in an √âcole des Beaux- arts [College of Fine Arts] where he learned different art techniques such as watercolors, pastels, and paintings. He continued to expand on his painting techniques by painting scenes of meetings in bookstores and flea markets. In 1948, he and Benantaur went to visit a friend in a hospital sanatorium. It was during this visit that Khadda saw the Museum of Fine Arts where he was inspired by paintings by Eug√®ne Delacroix, Eug√®ne Fromentin, Th√©odore Chass√©riau, and Nasreddine Dinet. He was also influenced by sculptures by Auguste Rodin and Antoine Bourdelle. In 1953, like many other artists from Africa, Mohammed Khadda traveled to Paris, France to continue his education. During that time, he studied under Pablo Picasso and learned the styles of Cubism which greatly influenced his art. He spent a decade in Europe before returning to Algeria. After returning, he worked to set up an art community in Algeria for young aspiring artists to hone their potential skills. In 1964, he and others established the National Union of the Visual Arts. Khadda established the Sign Painters and School of the Sign in 1967. He also illustrated books for Rachid Boudjedra, Tahar Djaout, and others.  Important movements  Mohammed Khadda was involved in many art movements and organizations throughout his career that have and will continue to influence art in Africa and the rest of the world. Some of these include: * National Union of the Visual Arts, 1967 * Aouchem (Arabic for tattoo) Art Movement, 1967 * School of Sign, 1967 * \\"Sign Painters\\" * Created over 70 murals in the 1970s * Fought with the National Liberation Army during French Resistance  Tribute  On March 14, 2020, Google celebrated his 90th birthday with a Google Doodle.

Its seat was in the city of Arkhangelsk. The krai was located in the North of European Russia, and its territory is currently divided between Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Kostroma, and Kirov Oblasts, the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, and the Komi Republic. History The krai was established on January 14, 1929 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. The territory of the krai was formed from three governorates (Arkhangelsk, Vologda, and Northern Dvina) and the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast. On July 15, 1929 the All-Russian Central Executive Committee issued a decree splitting Northern Krai (with the exception of the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast, which remain as a single unit with the seat in Ust-Sysolsk, and the islands of Vaygach, Kolguev, Matveyev, Novaya Zemlya, Solovetsky Islands, and Franz Josef Land) into five administrative districts (okrugs) *Arkhangelsk Okrug (with the seat located in Arkhangelsk; *Nenets Okrug (with the borders and the seat to be defined); *Northern Dvina Okrug (Veliky Ustyug); *Nyandoma Okrug (Nyandoma); *Vologda Okrug (Vologda). Before the krai was established, the division of its constituent governorates mixed the old division inherited from the Russian Empire (uyezds) with the new one (districts, or raions). The same decree established the division of the krai into districts. All okrugs and the Komi- Zyryan Autonomous Oblast were divided into districts, and the Arctic ocean islands remained subordinate to the Krai executive committee. The following districts were established, *In Arkhangelsk Okrug: Arkhangelsky (with the administrative center in Arkhangelsk), Bereznikovsky (Bereznik), Chekuyevsky (Chekuyevo), Karpogorsky (Karpogory), Kholmogorsky (Kholmogory), Leshukonsky (Leshukonskoye), Mezensky (Mezen), Onezhsky (Onega), Pinezhsky (Pinega), Plesetsky (the settlement at the Plesetskaya railway station), Primorsky (Arkhangelsk), and Yemetsky (Yemetsk). *In Nenets Okrug: Kanino-Timansky (Nizhnyaya Pesha), Nenetsky (Khoseda-Khord). *In Northern Dvina Okrug: Cherevkovsky (Cherevkovo), Kichmengsko-Gorodetsky (Kichmengsky Gorodok), Kotlassky (Kotlas), Krasnoborsky (Krasnoborsk), Lalsky (Lalsk), Lensky (Yarensk), Nikolsky (Nikolsk), Oparinsky (settlement at the Oparino railway station), Podosinovsky (Podosinovets), Roslyatinsky (Roslyatino), Sukhonsky (Gorodishchenskoye), Velikoustyugsky (Veliky Ustyug), Verkhnetoyemsky (Verkhnyaya Toyma), Vilegodsky (Ilyinsko-Podomskoye), Vokhomsky (Vokhma). *In Nyandoma Okrug: Kargopolsky (Kargopol), Konoshsky (settlement at the Konosha railway station), Nyandomsky (Nyandoma), Priozyorny (Konyovo), Rovdinsky (Rovdino), Shenkursky (Shenkursk), Ustyansky (Shangaly), Velsky (Velsk), Verkhovazhsky (Verkhovazhye). *In Vologda Okrug: Chyobsarsky (settlement at the Chyobsara railway station), Gryazovetsky (Gryazovets), Kharovsky (settlement at the Kharovskaya railway station), Kokshengsky (Tarnogsky Gorodok), Kubeno-Ozyorsky (Kubenskoye), Ledengsky (Ledengskoye), Shuysky (Svyatogorye), Sverdlovsky (Sokol), Syamzhensky (Yarygino), Tolshmensky (Ust- Tolshma), Totemsky (Totma), Ust-Kubensky (Ustye), Vologodsky (Vologda), Vozhegodsky (settlement at the Vozhega railway station). *In the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast: Izhmo-Pechorsky (Izhma), Priluzsky (Obyachevo), Storozhevsky (Storozhevsk), Sysolsky (Vizinga), Udorsky (Koslanskoe), Ust- Kulomsky (Ust-Kulom), Ust-Sysolsky (Ust-Sysolsk), Ust-Tsylemsky (Ust-Tsylma), Ust-Vymsky (Ustvymskoye). Northern Krai on a 1930 map of European USSR In July 1930, the Okrugs were abolished. The Nenets Okrug became an autonomous unit, the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast remained intact, and the districts which were part of the four other Okrugs became directly subordinate to the Krai government. By August 25, 1930 the Krai consisted of *Cities of Arkhangelsk and Vologda; *Nenets National District (consisting of Bolshezemelsky, Kanino- Timansky, and Pustozersky districts); *Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast (Izhemsky, Priluzsky, Storozhevsky, Syktyvkarsky, Sysolsky, Troitsko- Pechorsky, Udorsky, Ust-Kulomsky, Ust-Usinsky, Ust-Tsylemsky, and Ust-Vymsky districts); *Fifty districts of central subordination: Bereznikovsky, Chekuyevsky, Cherevkovsky, Chyobsarsky, Gryazovetsky, Kargopolsky, Karpogorsky, Kharovsky, Kholmogorsky, Kichmengsko-Gorodetsky, Kokshengsky, Konoshsky, Kotlassky, Krasnoborsky, Kubeno-Ozersky, Lalsky, Ledengsky, Lensky, Leshukonsky, Mezensky, Nikolsky, Nyuksensky, Nyandomsky, Onezhsky, Oparinsky, Pinezhsky, Plesetsky, Podosinovsky, Primorsky, Priozyorny, Rovdinsky, Roslyatinsky, Shenkursky, Shuysky, Sukhonsky, Sverdlovsky, Syamzhensky, Tolshmensky, Totemsky, Ust-Kubinsky, Ustyansky, Velikoustyuzhsky, Velsky, Verkhnetoyemsky, Verkhovazhsky, Vilegodsky, Vologodsky, Vokhomsky, Vozhegodsky, Yemetsky; *Islands in the Arctic Ocean and Solovetsky Islands. Between 1930 and 1935 there were constant changes in the district configuration, some districts were abolished, established, and renamed. On February 10, 1934, Novaya Zemlya, Vaygach, and a number of smaller islands in the Barents and Kara Seas were moved to the Nenets National Okrug. By 1936, the Krai included 65 districts. On March 5, 1936, Pechorsky Okrug which was a part of the Northern Krai was established. The Okrug included three districts, Izhemsky, Ust-Tsilemsky, and Ust-Usinsky, and a part of Troitsko-Pechorsky District. This was related due to the beginning of the coal mining in the North of what is now the Komi Republic. According to the 1936 Soviet Constitution, Northern Krai was abolished, and its territory was divided between newly established Northern Oblast and Komi Republic. Northern Oblast included 54 districts and was in 1937 split into Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts. Three of the districts of Northern Krai, Lalsky, Oparinsky, and Podosinovsky, as the result of some later administrative changes, ended up in Kirov Oblast. Pavinsky and Vokhomsky District were later transferred into Kostroma Oblast.

In June 1643 he established a town guard, of which he was colonel, and enlisted all able-bodied men between 16 and 60. After the governor, Sir Nicholas Byron, was captured in March 1644, King Charles proposed Gamull in his place, but Gamull was rejected because he was unpopular with the citizens and opposed by other royalist leaders. Gamull was disabled from sitting in parliament on 22 January 1644, but was created in the baronet of Chester in April 1644. He was nominated as mayor in 1644 but was rejected.

Dating to c. 1489, it is housed in the Hans Memling Museum in the Old St. John's Hospital (Sint-Janshospitaal), Bruges in the Flemish Region of modern-day Belgium. The work was commissioned by the Hospital of St. John, the current museum's seat. Differently from other works by Memling, such as the Triptych of the Mystical Marriage of St. Catherine or the Florens Triptych, it is neither signed nor dated. It was a container for Saint Ursula's relics which was shown publicly only in her feast day. The relics were solemnly put in the shrine on 21 November 1489. Virgin and Child. Description The shrine is in the shape of a Gothic chapel, according to a customary format used in goldsmithing. It has a steeply pointed cover, as typical of northern European countries, with three painted tondoes on each side. Attributed to Memling's workshop, they depict, on one side, the First Eleven Virgins with the Pope, a Cardinal, a Bishop and Etherius (characters of the saint's legend); on the other side, the Coronation of the Virgin with the Holy Trinity. Arrival in Rome. The two \\"fa√ßades\\" contain the representations of the Virgin and Child between Two Nuns (the two donors, including the abbess), and St. Ursula Protecting the Holy Virgins. Both the scenes are embedded within a painted niche which simulates a perspective interior of the shrine. At the sides, under two small arcades, are six scenes of the life and martyrdom of St. Ursula, which resemble the style of the stained glasses in contemporary churches.

Life He was for some years prior of the Abbey of Westminster, and on 14 October 1222 was elected abbot in succession to Humeto or Humez, receiving the benediction from Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester. He became a privy councillor, and a baron of the exchequer next in rank to William de Shareshull. According to William Dugdale and John Weever, he was chief baron; but it is doubtful whether such an office existed at the time. In 1243 mandates to the sheriffs of counties to collect scutage money for the king Henry III's expedition to Gascony are tested in his name, and he appears at that time to have been a favourite and attendant upon the king. In 1245 he, with Walter Mauclerk, was king's deputy or lord justice of the kingdom during the king's absence in the Welsh wars, and on that ground he was excused from attendance at the First Council of Lyon the year before. He died 23 November 1246, having increased the revenues of his abbey by the addition of the churches of Ocham, Aschewell, and Strengesham, the manor of Thorpe, the castle of Morton Folet, the village of New Morton, Gloucestershire, and one half the manors of Longdon, Worcestershire and Chadesley, in Worcestershire. He was buried in a marble tomb before the altar of the Virgin in the lady chapel built in Humeto's abbacy; his tomb was destroyed in the time of Abbot William de Colchester.

It is thought to date from the 6th century, and it has been a scheduled monument since 1925. The inscription, in Latin, appears to read , though experts have stated that a bar above the second forms a ligature meaning that it should be read as . It is possible that there was more text on the stone that has weathered away. The inscription, which can be translated as \\"grandson or immediate descendant of Caratacus\\", has led to the general opinion that the stone was probably erected as a memorial to a person who claimed the first-century British chieftain Caratacus as an ancestor. The first mention of the stone was in 1219, when it was described in a perambulation of the Royal Forest of Exmoor as \\"the Langeston\\". In 1890 the letter (which is reversed) was missing from the inscription, but by 1919 the missing piece had been found and was cemented back in place. In 1906 a shelter was erected over the stone, and an excavation in 1937 revealed that the stone was not associated with a burial site.

The film is a remake of the 1930 pre-Code comedy The Matrimonial Bed, which was produced by Warner Bros. from an English stage play adaptation by Seymour Hicks (Mr. What's His Name) of a French comic farce, Au Premier de Ces Messieurs (\\"To the First Husband\\"), written by Yves Mirande and Andr√© Mou√´zy-√âon. Plot Fickle Juliet Marsden (Shirley Ross) breaks off her engagement to Lucius Lorimer (Jerome Cowan) for the third time to marry handsome singer and ladykiller Rodney Trask (Dennis Morgan). After the wedding, Juliet's Southern cousin, Laura Anders (Jane Wyatt), calls from South Carolina to apologize for not attending because of appendicitis. Juliet promises to visit Laura on her honeymoon and has Rodney write down the address. Before the newlyweds can leave, Rodney is visited by a woman named Clara Raymond, who blackmails him over their past relationship. Juliet's friend, Betty Trent (Lee Patrick), sees them drive away in Rodney's car. Rodney refuses to pay and is hit over the head by Clara's accomplice and develops amnesia. The would-be blackmailers drive the car over a cliff, where it bursts into flames, and although no body is found, Rodney is believed to be dead. Rodney, not knowing who he is, takes the name \\"Happy Homes\\" from an F.H.A. billboard he chances to see, finds Laura's address in his pocket, and travels to her cotton plantation in search of his true identity. Laura has no idea who he is, but Rodney talks her into hiring him to run the nearly bankrupt plantation. A year passes and love develops between Happy and Laura. They marry, and before leaving on their honeymoon, make a surprise visit to Juliet. Family and friends (including Lucius) immediately recognize \\"Happy\\" as Rodney, but are not quite certain if he is really Rodney or just someone who looks like him. Laura and Happy are unaware of the true situation, and when the household concocts a series of delays to prevent the couple from proceeding on their honeymoon, conclude everyone is crazy. They decide to sneak out to Niagara Falls, but Juliet discovers the plan. She diverts fuel oil into the water pipes and drenches both in goo when they take showers. Finally Happy is hypnotized by Juliet's psychiatrist uncle and recovers his memory, thinking it is the day of his first wedding. Lucius reveals the entire story to the innocent Laura. Refusing to admit defeat because she loves Happy, Laura hogties Juliet and locks her in the sabotaged shower. She confronts Rodney alone is his bedroom. She convinces him that she is the \\"Cousin Laura\\" that he spoke to on the phone and that a year has passed. Rodney realizes that he is married to both women. She also charms him into kissing her, and his latent feelings for her arise again. Juliet, covered in black oil, escapes the shower and finds Rodney kissing Laura, leading to a pillow fight over his affections that winds up with Juliet being tarred and feathered. Laura decides to leave for South Carolina. Rodney realizes that he loves Laura. He tricks her into bashing him over the head with an urn containing his supposed remains (buttons from his overcoat) and \\"becomes\\" Happy again. Juliet disgustedly concludes that he is a \\"chameleon\\" and gives him up.

They were originally proposed by Hans Georg Feichtinger and are recognized to be the right kind of function spaces for time-frequency analysis. Feichtinger's algebra, while originally introduced as a new Segal algebra,H. Feichtinger. \\"On a new Segal algebra\\" Monatsh.

For 1\\\\leq p,q \\\\leq \\\\infty , a non-negative function m(x,\\\\omega) on \\\\mathbb{R}^{2d} and a test function g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) , the modulation space M^{p,q}_m(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) is defined by : M^{p,q}_m(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f\\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\ :\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^d}\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^d} V_gf(x,\\\\omega)^p m(x,\\\\omega)^p dx\\\\right)^{q/p} d\\\\omega\\\\right)^{1/q} < \\\\infty\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. In the above equation, V_gf denotes the short-time Fourier transform of f with respect to g evaluated at (x,\\\\omega) , namely :V_gf(x,\\\\omega)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^d}f(t)\\\\overline{g(t-x)}e^{-2\\\\pi it\\\\cdot \\\\omega}dt=\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}_{\\\\xi}(\\\\overline{\\\\hat{g}(\\\\xi)}\\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi+\\\\omega))(x). In other words, f\\\\in M^{p,q}_m(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) is equivalent to V_gf\\\\in L^{p,q}_m(\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d}) . The space M^{p,q}_m(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) is the same, independent of the test function g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) chosen. The canonical choice is a Gaussian. We also have a Besov-type definition of modulation spaces as follows.B.X. Wang, Z.H. Huo, C.C. Hao, and Z.H. Guo. Harmonic Analysis Method for Nonlinear Evolution Equations. World Scientific, 2011. : M^s_{p,q}(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f\\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\ :\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\sum_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d} \\\\langle k \\\\rangle^{sq} \\\\\\\\psi_k(D)f\\\\_p^q\\\\right)^{1/q} < \\\\infty\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\langle x\\\\rangle:=x+1, where \\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_k\\\\\\\\} is a suitable unity partition.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. In 1993 its benefice was united with that of St Michael and All Angels, Ashton-on-Ribble. History St Mark's was built in 1862‚Äì63 and designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. The cost of the church and the site was ¬£6,594 (). The tower was added between 1868 and 1870. This is particularly tall because it was built to rival the very high steeple of the nearby Roman Catholic Church of St Walburge, which had been added to that church in 1867. By the middle of the 20th century the population of St Mark's parish was declining, and the church was declared redundant on 1 December 1982. The building lay empty for over 10 years, and was then converted into residential flats. The altar and other furnishings were moved to St Michael and All Angels' Church, Ashton-on-Ribble, and installed in its Lady chapel, which was renamed St Mark's Chapel. Architecture The former church is constructed in sandstone ashlar, and has a slate roof. Its architectural style is Decorated. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, north and south transepts, a chancel terminating in a three-sided apse, a west porch, and a tower at the northeast angle. At the west end is a three-bay porch flanked by buttresses terminating in gables. The porch is carried on plain columns with a gable above the central bay. Over the porch is a large five-light window. Along the sides of the nave are three-light windows separated by buttresses. The north and south walls of the transepts each contains two small two-light windows, with a wheel window above. Each side of the apse contains a tall two-light window rising into a gable. The tower is tall, is in four unequal stages, and has a narrow octagonal stair turret at the southeast corner. In the third stage are two tall and narrow two-light windows on each side. On each side of the top stage are two two-light louvred bell openings rising into gables which break through the parapet. The parapet is pierced, and at the corners of the tower are pinnacles. Comparing the tower with the tall steeple of St Walburge's, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner says that it \\"tries to complete with the steeple of St Walburge in prominence and to defeat it by solidity and sensibleness\\". In converting the church for residential purposes, balconies have been created and new windows have been added. The former school building has been converted into a design studio and occupied by Heckford Advertising Agency since 1990.

It is the type genus of the spurred trapdoor spiders, Idiopidae. Idiops is also the most species-rich genus of the family, and is found at widely separated locations in the Neotropics, Afrotropics, Indomalaya and the Middle East. Females live in tubular burrows lined with a thick layer of white silk. These typically have a D-shaped lid that fits into the entrance like a cork, and some burrows have two entrances. The lid may consist of mud, moss or lichen, which is bound below by a thick layer of silk. As in all genera of this family, the anterior lateral eyes (ALE) are situated near the clypeal margin, far in front of the remaining six eyes, which are arranged in a tight group. The males which are smaller in size, wander about or occasionally live in burrows. Like other mygalomorphs, they are relatively large and long-lived. Forest clearance and agricultural practices that loosen the soil and enhance erosion, besides soil removal for brick making have been pointed out as serious threats to some Indian species. Species ranges are poorly known ‚Äì in India for instance, most species are known only from their type localities.

He is Professor in the mathematical faculty of the University of Vienna. He is editor-in-chief of the Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications (JFAA) and associate editor to several other journals. He is one of the founders and head of the Numerical Harmonic Analysis Group (NuHAG) at University of Vienna. Today Feichtinger's main field of research is harmonic analysis with a focus on time-frequency analysis. Biography Hans Georg Feichtinger was born in Wiener Neustadt where he graduated from the Gymnasium and received the Matura \\"summa cum laude\\" in 1969. In the same year he started his studies in mathematics and physics. He finished his PhD at the University of Vienna in 1974 under the supervision of Hans Reiter in 1974 with a doctoral thesis on Subalgebras of L1(G). Feichtinger attained professorship with the defense of his habilitation thesis on Banach convolution algebras of functions, Universit√§tsbibliothek Wien in 1979. Feichtinger is author or co-author to roughly 200 scientific publications. The University of Vienna being the center of his scientific life, Feichtinger still had several visiting positions across Europe and in the USA between 1980 and today, e.g. at the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Connecticut, Storrs. He is married and the father of four children., Hans Georg Feichtinger's Homepage =The NuHAG (Numerical Harmonic Analysis Group)= In the late 1980s Hans Georg Feichtinger and Karlheinz Gr√∂chenig conducted joint research on atomic decompositions. From 1990 on, Feichtinger investigated irregular sampling and computational harmonic analysis with Thomas Strohmer. These cooperations were the basis for founding the Numerical Harmonic Analysis Group (NuHAG) at the University of Vienna with Feichtinger as group leader. While the research project Experimental Signal Analysis is noted as the starting point of NuHAG, The 'Experimental Signal Analysis' project at NuHAG several earlier publications and projects are listed to be NuHAG related, the earliest dates back to 1986., NuHAG research page Over the years, NuHAG has become a group of international importance in the fields from abstract harmonic analysis to applied time-frequency analysis and currently hosts around 40 researchers (including PhD students)., NuHAG member page =Dedication to the University of Vienna and the scientific community= Hans Georg Feichtinger is the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications taking over from John J. Benedetto in the year 2000, and associate editor to the Journal of Approximation Theory (JAT), the Journal of Function spaces and Applications (JFSA) and Sampling Theory in Signal and Image Processing (STSIP). Furthermore, Feichtinger was for many years the contact person for the European Union's student exchange program LEONARDO at the faculty of mathematics of the University of Vienna and is actively involved in workshops and conferences., NuHAG event database Throughout his career Hans G. Feichtinger has supervised 23 completed PhD theses, also today he is advising several students (as of June 2011). Scientific work The scientific work of Hans Georg Feichtinger includes, but is not limited to results on function spaces, irregular sampling, time-frequency analysis, Gabor analysis and frame theory. Some of his most notable contributions are listed below. In the early 1980s, Feichtinger introduced modulation spaces, a family of function spaces defined by the behavior of the short-time Fourier transform with respect to a test function from the Schwartz space. They have become the standard spaces in time-frequency analysis. Also, while the concept of function spaces treating local and global behavior separately was already known earlier, Wiener amalgam spaces were introduced by Feichtinger in 1980, also his publications have contributed to the acknowledgment of amalgam spaces as a useful tool in various mathematical fields. Around 1990 the joint research with Karlheinz Gr√∂chenig lead to a series of papers, which is today referred to as coorbit theory. The theory provides a unified framework for different important transforms, e.g. the wavelet transform and the short-time Fourier transform. Feichtinger also proposed the use of Banach Gelfand triples, especially the Banach Gelfand triple S_0 \\\\subset L^2 \\\\subset S_0' that has proven very useful, e.g. in time-frequency analysis. =Feichtinger's conjecture= Prof. Feichtinger and Prof. Kadison at a meeting in 2011 Feichtinger once raised the question, whether :Every bounded frame can be written as a finite union of Riesz basic sequences. The question is now widely referred to as Feichtinger's conjecture, a term first used by Peter G. Casazza. This question was not only an important open problem in frame theory but was found to be equivalent to the famous and long-open Kadison‚ÄìSinger problem in analysis (first stated in 1959). Proofs were known for certain special cases since 2005,Frames and the Feichtinger Conjecture by Peter G. Casazza, Ole Christensen, Alexander M. Lindner and Roman Vershynin The Feichtinger Conjecture for Wavelet Frames, Gabor Frames and Frames of Translates by Marcin Bownik and Darrin Speegle and in 2013 an equivalent to the full conjecture was proved by Adam Marcus, Daniel A Spielman and Nikhil Srivastava.Interlacing Families II: Mixed Characteristic Polynomials and the Kadison-Singer Problem by Adam Marcus, Daniel A Spielman and Nikhil Srivastava Selected publications Hans Georg Feichtinger has published approximately 200 scientific articles,, NuHAG BIBTEX database a selection of which is presented below (in chronological order): * H.

His collection of songbooks was bequeathed to the British Library in 1941. Life Barry Ono was the stage name of Frederick Valentine Harrison. Ono was born in Chelsea, London on 21 May 1876. Though he struggled early in his career as a comedian and comedic songwriter, he did gain some notoriety and experienced a peak in his career in 1929. Several of his songs were published in collections such as The Great Barry Ono Song Book.A second edition of The Great Barry Ono Song Book is held by the British Library. The book contains several original songs by Ono and references others not mentioned in the book. Many of the songs have as their themes military or international topics. On the front page is a blurb explaining that Barry Ono claimed \\"to be the First Artiste in the World to SING a Song of [World War I], and the First Author to Write one\\" because he \\"wrote, composed and sang 'Give Three Cheers for Belgium, what have they done to the Kaiser?' within three hours of news in London papers of the German invasion of Belgium\\". He was especially known for a one-man routine called \\"The Old Time Music Hall.\\" In this 12-minute routine, Ono would do impressions of former singers performing their favorite songs. Ono began withdrawing from the stage in 1930 and it has been speculated that this was connected to the death of Maude Walsh, who shared the stage with him in 1927. In 1932, Ono married Dorinda Hill (the stage name of Dorothy Hiscox) and, though their wedding certificate records that Ono was a widower, no records of any previous marriages have been found. Ono was an avid collector penny fiction and at the age of twelve conducted a lending library from his home in which, for an initial fee of six pence plus a penny-a-week subscription, boys could borrow from his own collection.

In the , Cranley had a population of 1446 people.  Geography  Cranley is located north-west from the Toowoomba central business district. Its northern and eastern boundary approximately follow Gowrie Creek. Its western boundary is Boundary Road. Most of the land is small farms and very low-density rural residential. Exceptions to this are in the southern part of the locality and include the Baillie Henderson Hospital, which provides mental health services in the Darling Downs region, a waste water treatment plant, and the Palm Lake Resort retirement village.  History  Cranley (formerly Bremmers Gate) on the railway line from Toowoomba to Warwick, 1897.jpg A railway station on the Southern railway line from Toowoomba to Warwick was established in the 1870s and named after James Cranley, a landholder and farmer in the district. James Cranley was a Toowoomba municipal councillor from 1864 to 1866. He was born in County Tipperary, Ireland around 1811 and died in Toowoomba on 3 July 1890. He immigrated to Moreton Bay with his family on the John Fielden in June 1853 and spent several years working at Corranga and Jimbour Station on the Darling Downs before settling in Toowoomba district around 1857. In the 2006 census, Cranley had a population of 724 people. In the 2011 census, Cranley had a population of 852 people. From 2015, construction began on the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. An interchange is being built at the end of Mort Street to provide a new northern entry into central Toowoomba. Due to traffic being diverted from the inner city, it is likely that businesses will open around Cranley to accommodate for traffic using the bypass.

By facilitating and fostering stronger working relations between counterparts working in the field throughout Europe, REFUREC aims to minimise the regulatory burden of the new rules, and to maximise the overall effectiveness of the Renewables Directive.EC Transparency Platform Transparency Platform of the European Commission (according to article 24 of Directive 2009/28/EC) Structure REFUREC is an informal network, participation is voluntary and not binding. There are no membership fees involved. The network organises two till four formal meetings a year to share knowledge, ideas and strategies on how best to implement workable interpretations of the Renewables Directive across respective borders. The member states of the EU and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have evolved different methods of regulating biofuel consumption. The different starting points, combined with the intrinsic subtleties and complexities of the legislation are what lead REFUREC to believe that this kind of close co-operation is key to successful implementation of the Renewables Directive. In addition to formal meetings, REFUREC organises topic-specific ad-hoc meetings, facilitates internal working groups with interested member state organisations participating, and coordinates pan-European information exchange in between the formal meetings. The administrative part is provided by an informal, rotating secretariat.

October 2013 - September 2015, the Swedish Energy Agency coordinated the secretariat work. In October 2015, the Finnish Energy Authority took the lead and provided secretariat support for two years, before Orkustofnun, Iceland's National Energy Authority, took over until September 2019. Since October 2019, Ireland's National Oil Reserves Agency holds responsibility for two years. Meetings The inaugural meeting was held on 4 February 2010 in London, and was attended by representatives from the UK, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, and the European Commission. To date, further workshops have been held in Brussels, Bonn, Madrid, The Hague, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Stockholm, Valletta, Dublin, Oslo, Luxembourg, Paris, Bratislava, Helsinki, Vienna, Tallinn, Reykjavik, and Warsaw.

The film was produced by Shooting Star Filmcompany. The film was selected as the Dutch entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. Plot In 1928, a young man from Suriname named Waldemar Nods (Sergio Hasselbaink) goes to the Netherlands to study. His dark skin stands out and causes discrimination. He moves to lodging in The Hague with Rika van der Lans, who went to live separated from her deeply religious husband Willem, after she discovered him cheating with the maid Jans. She has taken all four of their children (Willem, John, Bertha and Henk) with her. Waldemar and the seventeen years his senior Rika start a relationship and she becomes pregnant. She says nothing to Waldemar and goes to a woman for an illegal abortion, but changes her mind. When she is four months pregnant she tells Waldemar. He is angry for not having been told, and leaves. Wim and Jan run away, to their father Willem. Waldemar returns, and when Willem visits Rika to tell her about a job opening in Indonesia, he asks her to come along. He will accept the baby as his own child. He changes his mind when he learns the father is dark skinned. He also gets a court order for Bertha and Henk to live with him, with success. He refuses a divorce, preventing Rika remarrying Waldemar. When the child is born, they call the boy Waldy, nicknamed Sonny Boy. Rika‚Äôs landlord terminates the rental, because of Rika's extramarital affair, especially with a dark-skinned Surinamese. Rika and Waldemar roam the streets with Waldy, when they meet an older Jewish man, Sam, who rents them a room. With financial support from Sam, Rika and Waldemar start a guest house in Scheveningen. When The Netherlands was invaded by the Germans, Rika and Waldemar are forced to give shelter to German soldiers. Later on they have to evacuate the guest house, as the area is cleared for the Atlantikwall defense system. Because Rika is mother of five children she is allotted a big replacement house. At the request of a young resistance fighter, Kees Chardon, she met through the help of a clergyman, Rika starts hiding people in her house. As the fee for Jews is higher than for Dutch, she chooses to hide Jewish people. After some time, a SS deserter hides as well. At first Waldy is not informed of the hiders, but after witnessing Sam‚Äôs deportation and a street fight Rika is visited by a collaborating official. Waldy hears something upstairs and discovers the hide aways. AAfter a raid, the hiders are discovered and arrested, together with Waldemar, Rika and Waldy. Waldy is released and goes to live with relatives and eventually to a foster family. This is not safe, because the Germans want to put more pressure on Waldemar and Rika during interrogations. Waldy is therefore placed with a farmer. When people come to the farm during the hunger winter, Waldy prevents a couple selling their wedding rings for food, by offering his parents‚Äô rings. The farmer refuses Waldy‚Äôs rings and explain everybody tries to make some money during wartime, also Rika and Waldemar were paid for the hiding. Waldemar is shipped to Neuengamme, but through his language skills, he is drafted for the mailroom. This gives him opportunity to send letters to Waldy clandestinely. After Hitler's death, Waldemar is deported to the ship Cap Arcona, which was bombed by British fighters. He jumps into the sea and manages to swim to the shore. On arrival on the beach, he is killed by two German child soldiers. Sometime later, Marcel and Bertha arrive at a train station where they meet up with Waldy and take him to live with his maternal grandparents. He is given a letter written by his mother who wished her children and parents luck, with hopes of visiting her husband. In the end credits, it is revealed Rika had died that year in KZ Ravensbr√ºck after a epidemic of dysentery. Also, Waldy never knew the truth about his parents' deaths until sixty years later in 2004.

Early life and career Ivan Ratiev was born in Oryol of a branch of the Georgian princely house of Ratishvili, which had emigrated to the Russian Empire in 1724. His father was an officer in the Russian army. Ivan Ratiev graduated from the Oryol Cadet Corps and then from the Nikolayevsky Cavalry College. In 1890 he joined the 44th Nizhegorod Dragoon Regiment, deployed in Georgia.

Winter Palace Ratiev retired from army service due to a trauma sustained in a horse race at Tbilisi in 1907. He then studied at Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and, after his return to Russia, worked for the Ministry of the Imperial Court. He was assigned to an army cavalry unit of the Winter Palace with the rank of rittmeister. By the imperial order of December 6, 1913, he was made a lieutenant-colonel (podpolkovnik) of the Imperial Guard cavalry and an acting Police Master of the Winter Palace. Promoted to the rank of colonel in 1916, Prince Ratiev was appointed as a deputy commandant of the Winter Palace in April 1917, two months after the February Revolution overthrew the tsar Nicholas II. Ratiev's wife, Georgian princess Ekaterine Bagration-Gruzinskaya During the storm of the Winter Palace by the Bolshevik revolutionaries on October 25, 1917, Ratiev did not flee, but ordered his guardsmen to evacuate the former imperial treasures to safer areas of the Palace. He dispatched his 16-year son Dimitri and two most trusted grenadiers to guard the secret depository, which, among other precious objects, housed the tsar's scepter incorporating the Orlov diamond. He then negotiated with the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, who oversaw the storm of the Palace, thereby saving the treasures of the Palace from being looted and destroyed. The Soviet leadership publicly expressed their gratitude to Prince Ratiev on the pages of Izvestia (November 5, 1917) for \\"self-sacrificing efforts to protect and preserve the people's treasures\\" and appointed him the chief commandant of the Winter Palace and of all state museums and palaces of the Petrograd district.Norman, Geraldine (1998), The Hermitage: The Biography of a Great Museum, p. 150.

Later life In March 1919, Ratiev escorted the \\"golden echelon\\", a train carrying Russia's gold reserve, upon the transfer of the Russian government from Petrograd to Moscow. The road to Moscow was uneasy, Ratiev being pressured into surrendering the train and even being fired upon at Tver. Ratiev retired from the state service shortly thereafter and worked as a translator for various organizations of Moscow for several years. His subsequent life was marred by the loss of his wife and a son, who drowned while swimming in the river.

Production background The Life Story of David Lloyd George is about David Lloyd George, British Prime Minister from 1916 to 1922. It was written by Sidney Low, directed by Maurice Elvey, and stars Norman Page as Lloyd George. Other actors who appear are Ernest Thesiger, Alma Reville, and Douglas Munro. The film was produced by the Ideal Film Company, which had been started around 1910 by two Jewish Manchester-born brothers, Harry Moses and Simon Rowson (born Rosenbaum). The film's release was much anticipated, and the film press carried impressive advertisements for it in late 1918. However, in December 1918, all the advertisement stopped, following an attack in the influential paper John Bull by its owner, the MP Horatio Bottomley, who claimed that the Rowsons, because they had changed their last name and had employed some foreign-born extras to play soldiers in the film's war scenes, had less than patriotic motives for making the film. The Rowsons started the process of suing him for libel, but were shortly afterwards informed that Lloyd George, who initially had supported the production of the film, no longer wanted it shown. Solicitors, presumably acting for the government or for Lloyd George's Liberal Party, visited the film company, paid ¬£20,000 in cash (a very high figure at the time), and walked away with the negative and the only print. The reason why Lloyd George took this action is still unknown, but is the subject of much speculation.David Berry, Simon Horrocks: David Lloyd George: The Movie Mystery, University of Wales Press, 1998 Linked 2015-03-18 Dr Seth Th√©voz on The Life Story of David Lloyd George.

The FFC is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter and is jointly staffed from both organisations. Background Following severe flooding across the UK in 2007 a review was commissioned by the government to see what lessons could be learned. Chaired by Sir Michael Pitt the review produced a number of recommendations which were published in June 2008, among them was the recommendation that the different agencies work more closely together to improve warnings services. Formation and role The FFC was officially opened on 21 April 2009 in London by Environment Minister Hilary Benn. Its role is to provide better advice to governments, local authorities, emergency responders and the general public via its parent organisations. It faced its first major test in November 2009 when severe flooding affected Northern England, in particular Cumbria and the town of Cockermouth. The Pitt Review progress report highlighted the accuracy of the advice issued ahead of this event.

While not an actual alliance, the treaty confirmed the amicable Dano- Russian relation and obliged the parties to not support the other parties in the war, to respect each other's claims in Old Livonia, and to grant free passage to each other's merchants. By 1562, Frederick II of Denmark and Ivan IV of Russia were two of several parties claiming superiority rights in Livonia, none of whom was able to decide the conflict for themselves. Instead of engaging in open war, Frederick II and Ivan IV preferred to uphold the long tradition of amicable Dano-Russian relations. The treaty has been noted for the circumstances that a European great power met the Russian tsardom on equal footing, and that no prior military decision forced the parties to conclude it. In practice, the treaty was not wholly implemented. This was in part due to Frederick II's limited engagement in Livonia, where his brother Magnus pursued his own policies. In the subsequent war years, while not antagonizing Frederick II, Ivan IV would deal with Magnus directly, eventually making him king of Livonia as his vassal. Livonia in 1562 In 1562, during the early stage of the Livonian War, the territory of the present-day states Estonia and Latvia (then Terra Mariana or Old Livonia) was contested between Sigismund II Augustus of Poland‚ÄìLithuania, Ivan IV \\"The Terrible\\", tsar of Russia, Frederick II of Denmark-Norway and Erik XIV of Sweden.Frost (2000), p. 25. The Livonian Confederation had turned to Poland-Lithuania for protection in the 1557 Treaty of Pozvol, provoking the intervention of Ivan IVDe Madariaga (2006), p. 127 who, despite significant territorial gains and the important victory at Ermes (Ergeme), was unable to subordinate all Livonia. The bulk of the disintegrating Livonian Confederation was subordinated to Poland-Lithuania in the Treaty of Vilnius (1561),De Madariaga (2006), pp. 129‚Äì30. forming the duchies of Livonia and Courland and Semigallia. With Reval (Tallinn) accepting Swedish superiority, also in 1561, Sweden had established a dominion in Estonia despite the protests of Frederick II, who claimed historical rights on the area and had already purchased the Bishopric of √ñsel‚ÄìWiek in western Estonia. Robert I. Frost has summarized the 1562 state of war as an \\"uneasy stalemate:\\" while Denmark, Sweden, Russia and Poland-Lithuania had staked overlapping claims, the local parties of the broken-up Livonian Confederation had at least preliminarily chosen sides and intense fighting had occurred between some of the respective armies, a stable solution was not in sight even if military engagements had waned.Frost (2000), pp. 25, 77. Interests of Frederick II, Ivan IV and Magnus Frederick II focussed on his competition with Erik XIV of Sweden for hegemony in and around the Baltic Sea, which in 1563 culminated into the Northern Seven Years' War. He had no ambitions to enter a conflict with Ivan IV of Russia, and despite a brief irritation in the context of Christian III's occupation of √ñsel (√òsel, Saaremaa) in 1558, Dano- Russian relations were amicable and based on a mutual assistance pact of 1493, renewed in 1506 and 1517.H√ºbner (1998), p. 317. Ivan IV likewise did not wish a conflict with Frederick II, as he was unable to reach an understanding with the other parties in the Livonian war, Sweden and Poland-Lithuania, and was pressed by Crimean Tartar invasions at his tsardom's southern frontier. Frederick II had an uneasy relation to his younger brother Magnus, Duke of Holstein, whom he established in √ñsel‚ÄìWiek \\"to be rid\\" of him. Yet, after Magnus arrived in April 1560, he immediately started to expand by purchasing the Courlandian Stift Pilten (Piltene) and the Estonian bishopric of Reval, and thus by 1561 found himself bankrupt, in conflict with the other parties claiming these territories for themselves, and without any sufficient military means.H√ºbner (1998), p. 315. Magnus turned to his brother's court in Copenhagen hoping that Frederick II would abandon his policy of minimal involvement and enter the Livonian conflict on his side. Yet, Frederick II instead restricted Magnus to not conclude treaties without his consent anymore, obliged him to consolidate his finances by himself and assigned a governor for √ñsel‚ÄìWiek who was to closely monitor Magnus' activities in Livonia. Treaty On 6 July 1562, a group of Danish envoys arrived at Ivan IV's court in Moscow.von Adelung (1846), p. 231. The delegation was headed by Frederick II's hofmeister Eiler (also Eller, Elias) Hardenberg, and further included Jacob Brokenhusen, Jens Truelsen Ulfstand and Zacharias Vheling.von Adelung (1846), p. 230. Negotiations lasted only a month, and the treaty was concluded on 7 August in Mozhaysk (–ú–æ–∂–∞–π—Å–∫) west of Moscow. While the treaty did not contain a new mutual aid pact, *Frederick II and Ivan IV agreed that neither one would support either Sweden or Poland-Lithuania, *both sides acknowledged and confirmed each other's spheres of interest in Livonia, *Ivan IV guaranteed Magnus of Holstein his Livonian possessions, and *merchants from Denmark and the Russian Tsardom were allowed free passage in both realms.H√ºbner (1998), p. 318. The treaty did not contain an expiry date. Significance In historiography, the Mozhaysk agreements are regarded as a highly significant treaty. H√ºbner (1998) says that > \\"the high significance of this treaty, which has been called a 'milestone in > European history,' for the Muscovite state was not only due to its contents, > but also because a European great power was ready to conclude it on the > basis of a completely equal status, without a prior military conflict > forcing the parties to do so.\\"H√ºbner (1998), p. 318: \\"Die herausragende > Bedeutung dieses Vertrages, der als ein 'Meilenstein in der europ√§ischen > Geschichte' bezeichnet worden ist, lag f√ºr den Moskauer Staat aber nicht > allein in den Absprachen, sondern ebenso in der Tatsache, da√ü sich eine > europ√§ische Gro√ümacht, ohne da√ü einer der Vertragspartner durch eine > vorherige milit√§rische Auseinandersetzung dazu gezwungen gewesen w√§re, zu > einem Vertragsabschlu√ü auf der Basis vollst√§ndiger Gleichberechtigung > bereitfand.\\" However, the parties were unable to draw practical advantages from the treaty. Neither party was able to prevent Swedish forces from intruding and occupying part of their Livonian claims, the Danish and Polish kings agreed on mutual support against Sweden in the Northern Seven Years' War. Ivan IV delayed the implementation of the free trade agreements and concluded a seven-year truce with Sweden in 1564. In the following years, Ivan IV focussed on Magnus of Holstein rather than Frederick II, establishing him as the king of Livonia under his vassalage.H√ºbner (1998), pp. 319 ff.

From 1462 to 1471, he served as Duke of M√ºnsterberg jointly with his older brothers Victor and Henry the Elder. He also ruled Duchy of Opava jointly with his brothers from 1465 to 1472. Henry the Younger, held at times the office of regent of Bohemia and is also known as an author.  Life  Heinrich the Younger of Podƒõbrady was a son of King George of Podebrady of Bohemia from his second marriage with Johana of Ro≈æmit√°l. He received a humanist training and participated in knightly tournaments. His father, George, was King of Bohemia, but this crown was not heritable. George persuaded Emperor Frederick III in 1459 to appoint his eldest son Victor to Imperial Count. In 1462, Frederick also appointed Henry the Younger and his elder brother Henry the Elder to Imperial Count. Earlier, George had appointed his three sons Count of Glatz and enfeoffed them with the County of Glatz and the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg. In 1465 he also enfeoffed them with the Duchy of Opava, which he had acquired in 1464. In 1471, Henry the Younger married Catherine, the daughter of William III, Landgrave of Thuringia. His father died soon thereafter. Although Henry had stood at his father's side politically and religiously when he was young, he then turned to the Catholic faith. George's successor King Vladislas II undertook to protect George's sons and to take over their debts. George's sons initially ruled his territories together, but in 1472, the inheritance was split. Henry the Younger received Podƒõbrady, Kostomlaty nad Labem and possessions in Silesia. From his mother he inherited Lichnice Castle, Melnik and Teplice. At the state convention of Bene≈°ov in 1472, Henry was elected as the provincial administrator on the recommendation of his mother, who also took part. Unlike his mother, however, he sided with the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. The reason for this was probably that Vladislas repaid his debts only slowly, while Matthias Corvinus did so without hesitation. In 1475, Henry sold the Lordship of Kol√≠n, which he had received from his older brother Victor, for ducats to Matthias Corvinus, who stationed his Hungarian occupation troops there. After Henry appointed the Corvinus supported and despot Racek Kocovsk√Ω as the administrator of Konopi≈°tƒõ, Vladislas's supporters aligned with those of Matthias Corvinus. In 1478 it came to a reconciliation between Henry and Vladislas under the Treaty of Brno. Henry prepared the agreement to appointment Vladislas as King of Bohemia and played a significant role in resolving various religious and legal disputes Bohemia. In 1488 he chose the side of the Silesian princes who rebelled against Matthias Corvinus. After the rebellion was suppressed, he had to assign his inherited possessions of Podƒõbrady and Kostomlaty to John Corvinus, an illegitimate son of Matthias Corvinus. Henry was, however, granted a life interest in these possessions. Henry the Younger died in 1492 at the Podƒõbrady Castle. His body was transferred to K≈Çodzko () and buried in the Franciscan monastery founded by his brother Henry the Elder. In 1558 he and eight other members of the Podƒõbrady family who had been buried there as well, were reburied in the church in K≈Çodzko. His main heir was Henry the Elder, who also took care of Henry's widow and her children.  Offspring  * From his marriage to Catherine of Saxony, Henry had a daughter Anna (1471‚Äì1517), who married in 1493 with Henry IV of Neuhaus. * With his mistress Catherine Vojkova of ≈†titar and Straznice (), he had several children, including Frederick, to whom he later bequeathed Kostomlaty.  Literary activity  Henry was also active in literature. In his works he dealt with contemporary history, the conversion to Catholicism, property disputes and his political stance. His poems about happiness, virtue, chivalry, and wisdom are in the contemporary style of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. He translated several novels and wrote entertaining prose. In his travels with King Matthias Corvinus, he met many humanists. Through him, the works of Giovanni Boccaccio became known in Bohemia. He translated them from German, and even added some of his own.

She was notable for accusing William Janklow of having raped her in January 1967 when he was a poverty lawyer and Director of the Rosebud Sioux Legal Services program on the reservation. She had worked as his babysitter. At the time the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not prosecute the case. In October 1974 Dennis Banks acted on her behalf as the tribal attorney to revive the charges, as Janklow was a candidate for state attorney general. Eagle Deer in 1974 had Janklow disbarred from practicing in the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Court. No charges were brought against Janklow in the alleged rape case and in 1975 he was appointed by the White House to the national board of the Legal Services Corporation. Eagle Deer was killed the night of April 4, 1975 in a purported hit-and-run accident in southern Nebraska. She had been seeing former American Indian Movement (AIM) activist Douglass Durham. He was discovered in late 1974 to be an FBI informant and expelled from AIM in March 1975. Janklow was elected governor of South Dakota in 1978, and twice served tenures of two terms. Early life and education Jancita Eagle Deer, a Brul√© Lakota, was born and grew up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. She attended local schools, including the Rosebud Boarding School on the Reservation. On January 14, 1967, Eagle Deer reported to her school principal that Janklow had raped her at gunpoint the night before. He had been driving her home from her work as his family's babysitter. The principal took her to the hospital, where a doctor and nurse examined her. In his memoir, Dennis Banks, an AIM founder who became involved in the case in 1974, said his review of the records showed the medical personnel said the girl was in shock. He believed that she had been assaulted. The BIA police conducted the investigation on the reservation, and the FBI did not think there was sufficient evidence to prosecute. The journalist Steve Hendricks also wrote there was evidence of an assault, but the case was not prosecuted. Later life In the fall of 1974, before the election for state attorney general, for which Janklow was the Republican Party candidate, AIM leader Dennis Banks encouraged Eagle Deer to testify to the tribal court about the rape case to try to gain justice. Anna Mae Aquash, another high-ranking AIM member, had located Eagle Deer in Iowa, where she had gone to escape rumors about the incident. Aquash persuaded the young woman to return to the Rosebud Reservation to testify.Dennis Banks with Richard Erdoes, Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement, Oklahoma University Press, 2005, pp. 270-283, accessed 29 June 2011 Eagle Deer testified at court. Janklow failed to appear in response to a BIA summons served through a US Marshal. Eagle Deer filed a petition (through her attorney Larry Leventhal and tribal attorney Dennis Banks) to disbar Janklow from the tribal court, to prevent him from practicing at the reservation. In their book on this period, Mario Gonzales, who served as judge of the Tribal Court, and the writer Elizabeth Cook-Lynn said the BIA allegedly had sent the police investigation files of the rape charges to its Aberdeen, South Dakota office to keep it out of the hands of the Tribal Court. The tribal court issued two misdemeanor warrants against Janklow and granted Eagle Deer's petition to disbar Janklow from practicing law on the Rosebud Reservation. No arrest was made, and Janklow denied all allegations connected with the rape case. The writer Peter Matthiessen included a statement by Banks on this issue in his book, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse (1983). Publication in paperback was delayed as Janklow sued both the author and publisher Viking Press for libel, but his suits were finally dismissed by the federal courts because of protection of free speech under the Constitution's First Amendment.Mario Gonzalez, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn: The Politics of Hallowed Ground: Wounded Knee and the Struggle for Indian Sovereignty, University of Illinois Press, 1998, pp. 98-100 Jancita Eagle Deer had started seeing Douglass Durham in the fall of 1974, soon after her return to South Dakota. According to Banks' 2005 memoir, he was concerned about Durham's relationship with Eagle Deer, especially after Aquash told him that Durham was physically abusing the young woman. Banks said he confronted Durham about it and said he \\"should let her go.\\" Banks said that in late 1974, Vernon Bellecourt and Clyde Bellecourt, leaders of AIM, shared documentary evidence showing that Durham was an FBI informant. Banks had earlier appointed him as head of security for AIM. Banks continued working with Durham for some time before he and other leaders confronted him and expelled him from AIM in February 1975. They held a press conference in March, at which Durham also spoke and admitted he was an FBI informant. Durham had participated in the Wounded Knee Incident on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and been closely involved with Banks and other leaders since then.Steve Hendricks: The Unquiet Grave: The FBI and the Struggle for the Soul of Indian Country, Thunder Heart Press, 2007, pp. 146-157 Jancita Eagle Deer continued to see Durham. On the night of April 14, 1975, she was struck and killed by a car while on a rural road in southern Nebraska, 200 miles from home. The journalist Hendricks wrote that she had last been seen in the company of Durham. Eagle Deer's brother said a man had picked her up from their family house that night. The coroner's report said she may have been beaten before the accident, or injured in being pushed out of another car before being hit, but because of her injuries, he could not tell for sure. After death After Jancita Eagle Deer's death, her step-mother Delphine Eagle Deer tried to take up her case against Janklow. Delphine Eagle Deer was the sister of Leonard Crow Dog, a spiritual leader in AIM. About nine months later in 1976, Delphine Eagle Deer was found beaten to death on the Rosebud reservation. According to Banks' memoir, she was beaten by a BIA policeman (unnamed), who pleaded drunkenness in his defense and was not charged.Banks, Ojibwa Warrior, p. 283 The writer Hendricks referred to the case as an unsolved murder. Janklow was later convicted of vehicular manslaughter for killing a motorcyclist in South Dakota in 2003. He died of terminal brain cancer on January 12, 2012.

History The corporation was established in 1983 to replace the Petroleum Department which was an agency under the Ministry of Fuel and Power. The department was responsible for the importation of crude oil and petroleum products for the Ghanaian economy. The mandate for oil exploration was held to be the Technical Directorate of the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Geological Survey Department. The corporation was created to promote the Government of Ghana's objective of supplying adequate and reliable petroleum for the country and the discovery of crude oil in the country's territories. Mandate The corporation was established as a state- owned company with the statutory backing of PNDC Laws 64 and 84. The laws mandated the corporation to engage in exploration, production and disposal of petroleum products. The laws also established the legal structure that informed the corporation in contractual agreements between the Government of Ghana and private oil exploration companies. In 1987, the Petroleum Income Tax Law were added to the corporation's mandate to permit it to tax various petroleum products for consumption. The law was the PNDC Law 188. Functions The corporation has among its functions to promote petroleum exploration activities, to appraise existing petroleum discoveries, and to ensure that Ghana benefits the most from the development of the country's petroleum resources. The corporation promotes the training of Ghanaians in petroleum-related activities and ensures environmental protection in all petroleum-related activities. Jubilee fields Jubilee Oil Field of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and National Petroleum Authority located off the coast of the Western Region in Ghana in the South Atlantic Ocean. The corporation announced in 2007 that the Petroleum Agreement signed in 2004 between Ghana represented by the Ministry of Energy and the Corporation, on the one hand, and Kosmos Energy HC and its partners had yielded in the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. Production of crude oil begun in December 2010. The country's oil fields are known as Jubilee fields and is situated at Cape Three Points in the Western region of the country. The corporation has controlling stake in all the oil wells that produce crude oil. In April 2011, GNPC confirmed that it had an initial 10% interest in a new oil discovery at the Paradise prospect offshore Ghana. The discovery was announced in April 2011 by Hess Corporation, a New York-based oil company. In June 2011, the corporation lifted 135,675 metric tonnes of Jubilee crude oil from the FPSO Kwame Nkrumah. This represented crude oil on behalf of the Ghana Group, comprising the Government of Ghana (GoG) and GNPC. It represented the first lifting of crude oil from the Jubilee fields. The barrels lifted comprised accumulated government royalties of 37,557 metric tonnes and accumulated GNPC's 13.75 per cent participating interest entitlement of 98,119 metric tonnes.

Raw's main feud was between John Cena and R-Truth for the WWE Championship. The crazed R-Truth started to set his sights on the WWE Championship and John Cena. R-Truth had been scheduled to compete against The Miz and John Cena in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules for the WWE Championship. John Morrison questioned Truth's ability to compete in the match and challenged him to a match for his spot. Morrison won the match, causing R-Truth to turn heel by attacking Morrison. R-Truth would cost Morrison the match at Extreme Rules. R-Truth claimed that there was a conspiracy against him in WWE and announced that he was done entertaining the fans as it did not earn him titles. He repeatedly ranted about Cena's popularity and even harassed a young Cena fan and his father by throwing water in the father's face after defeating Cena in a non-title match by countout. The anonymous Raw general manager announced a championship match between him and Cena at Capitol Punishment on the condition that R-Truth apologize for his actions. On the June 6 episode of Raw, R-Truth apologized for his actions and retained his title shot against John Cena. SmackDown's main feud on the card was between Christian and Randy Orton over the World Heavyweight Championship. After losing his rematch against Orton at Over the Limit, Christian challenged Orton to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship on the following episode of SmackDown, but was interrupted by Mark Henry and Sheamus. SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long then announced a triple threat number one contender's match between Christian, Henry, and Sheamus, with the winner facing Orton for the title the next week. Sheamus won the match after the referee missed Christian's pinfall on Sheamus due to Orton's interference. The following week, Christian asked to be added to the title match that night, but Long instead made him the special guest referee. Christian would help Orton retain the championship, but struck him with the title belt afterwards, turning heel for the second time since 2005. The next week, Christian again challenged Orton to a World Heavyweight Championship match at Capitol Punishment, which Orton accepted. Later that night, Sheamus defeated Orton in a non-title No Disqualification match after Christian interfered and hit Orton with the title belt again. On the June 17 episode of SmackDown, Sheamus faced Christian with the stipulation that he would be added to the championship match at Capitol Punishment if he won, but Christian ended up winning. After the match, Orton, who was at ringside, attempted to attack Christian, but he escaped; instead, Orton punted Sheamus in the head, sending a message to Christian. Evan Bourne and Jack Swagger had a mini-feud leading up to Capitol Punishment. Bourne and Swagger exchanged a series of wins and losses. But a more important feud on the card was between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. Punk and Mysterio similarly exchanged a series of wins and losses like Evan Bourne and Jack Swagger did, but Punk and Mysterio were reigniting a feud dating back to WrestleMania XXVI. Punk enlisted the aid of his New Nexus cronies to help him win against Rey, but they were to be banned from ringside at the pay-per-view. Ezekiel Jackson started to grow apart from The Corre, and wanted to pursue a singles career away from the group. Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, and Justin Gabriel didn't take kindly to Jackson's new aspirations, and promptly beat him down backstage, thus ousting him from the group. Jackson was given multiple opportunities at Barrett's Intercontinental Championship, but each time he got Barrett in the Torture Rack, his signature submission maneuver, Slater and Gabriel would interfere and attack Jackson. This would make Jackson win the match by disqualification, but Barrett retained as titles can't change hands by disqualification. During a six-man tag team match against The Usos and Jackson on SmackDown, Barrett abandoned Slater and Gabriel. He claimed that he was preserving his own interests since he had a title match at Capitol Punishment against Jackson, but Gabriel and Slater were angered by his actions. Gabriel and Slater then announced to Barrett that The Corre was no more and he could defend his title on Sunday without their help, effectively dissolving the group. On the May 23 episode of Raw, Big Show sat on Alberto Del Rio's luxury car, which angered Del Rio. When Show and his partner Kane lost their WWE Tag Team Championships to The New Nexus (David Otunga and Michael McGillicutty), Del Rio mocked them backstage during an interview segment. Del Rio even slapped Show across the face, resulting in Show chasing Del Rio into the parking lot, but Del Rio's personal ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez \\"accidentally\\" ran Show over with Del Rio's car. This injured Big Show's leg and left Kane without a partner. Del Rio and Rodriguez then made fun of Big Show by having Rodriguez dress like him, mocking Big Show's weight. On the June 13 episode of Raw, Big Show returned during Del Rio's match with Kane and assaulted him, but Del Rio managed to escape after Rodriguez attempted to save him, resulting in Show beating Rodriguez so badly that Kane had to pull him off Rodriguez. After that, guest host Stone Cold Steve Austin announced a match between Big Show and Del Rio at Capitol Punishment. On the June 17 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio made an appearance, but Big Show ran down to the ring and chased Del Rio into the crowd. The segment ended with Show destroying the ringside area. Another feud on the card was between The Miz and his former proteg√© Alex Riley. At Extreme Rules, Riley was not present when The Miz lost the WWE Championship to John Cena. The next night on Raw, Miz regained the championship from Cena after hitting him with the title belt; however, Riley accidentally revealed the title belt in Miz's hands to the referee. The referee then reversed his decision to Miz being disqualified and Cena retaining the championship. At Over the Limit, during The Miz's \\"I Quit\\" match with Cena, Riley left his cell phone behind which they had used to trick the referee into believing that Cena had said \\"I quit\\". The decision was reversed again and Miz went on to lose the encounter. On the May 23 episode of Raw, after the anonymous Raw general manager denied Miz's request for another WWE Championship match, he blamed Riley for him not regaining the title and fired him. Riley then assaulted Miz, turning face for the first time. The next week, Riley's interview with Michael Cole ended with Cole insulting Riley and Riley attacking Cole. Miz then came out and attacked Riley, but he got the upper hand and chased Miz out of the arena. A match between the two was then made official for Capitol Punishment. The United States Championship was also defended at the event, with Dolph Ziggler challenging champion Kofi Kingston. On the May 30 episode of Raw, Ziggler defeated Kingston in a non-title match, thus earning a championship match at the pay-per view. Event =Preliminary matches= The event opened with Kofi Kingston defending the WWE United States Championship against Dolph Ziggler. The match ended when Ziggler applied a sleeper hold on Kingston, who passed out. Ziggler won the match by technical submission and the title. Next, The Miz faced Alex Riley. Riley performed a lifting DDT to win the match. After that, Big Show faced Alberto Del Rio. Before the match, Mark Henry attacked Big Show and delivered a World's Strongest Slam through a broadcast table. Del Rio won the match by technical knockout after Big Show could not continue. In the fourth match, Wade Barrett defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Ezekiel Jackson. Jackson forced Barrett to submit to the Torture Rack to win the title. In the fifth match, CM Punk faced Rey Mysterio. In the end, Punk attempted to perform a GTS on Mysterio, but Mysterio countered the move and attempted to perform a 619 on Punk, but Punk countered the move. Punk performed a GTS on Mysterio to win the match. In the sixth match, Randy Orton defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Christian. During the match, Orton attempted an RKO on Christian, but Christian countered the move and performed a falling inverted DDT on Orton for a near-fall. Christian performed a spear on Orton for a near-fall. The match ended when Orton performed an RKO on Christian to retain the title, despite Christian's foot being under the bottom rope (which the referee did not see). Later, Jack Swagger faced Evan Bourne. In the end, Swagger applied an ankle lock on Bourne, but Bourne rolled out of the hold and pinned Swagger with an inside cradle to win the match. =Main event= The main event was for the WWE Championship between John Cena and R-Truth. During the match, Cena applied the STF on R-Truth, but Truth touched the bottom rope, forcing Cena to break the hold. Truth then performed a scissors kick on Cena for a near-fall. Cena attempted to perform an Attitude Adjustment on Truth, but Truth countered the move and performed a Shut Up on Cena for a near-fall. In the climax, Truth stole a hat and a drink from a young fan. When R-Truth passed the drink back to the fan, the fan threw the drink at R-Truth. Cena then threw Truth back into the ring and performed an Attitude Adjustment on him to retain the title. After the match, Cena celebrated with the young fan in the ring. Results References External links *Official Capitol Punishment website Category:2011 in Washington, D.C.

It was released on May 10, 2011, as the third single from his debut studio album Goblin. It features fellow Odd Future member Frank Ocean. The song was written by both Tyler and Ocean, with the production handled by Tyler. The song is written from the perspective of an obsessive lover who stalks and watches a woman while she sleeps. Lyrically, the song explores dark themes of necrophilia, stalking and obsession. The song received positive reviews from critics who praised Ocean's hook, though the subject matter was often noted as questionable in nature and content. A music video for the single was released on June 3, 2011 on the Odd Future YouTube channel. It was directed by Tyler himself and features Ocean. The video contains black humor and was noted for approaching its subject matter in a satirical, tongue-in-cheek manner. Both Tyler and Ocean would often perform the song together during their various tours and was notably performed at the April 2011 Coachella Music Festival. Production and composition Rapper Tyler, the Creator, who is often known for his controversial nature, and R&B; singer and occasional rapper Frank Ocean, who joined hip hop collective Odd Future, had quickly bonded and became friends, collaborating on several tracks such as \\"Analog 2\\", \\"Window\\" and \\"She.\\" Ocean appears on the track \\"She\\" providing a rapping verse, and the hook, while Tyler raps and covers the production. \\"She\\" has been described as \\"the closest thing to a slow jam on Goblin, where \\"Tyler genuinely wrestles with lust.\\" The song features Tyler, the Creator pining \\"for a gorgeous girl\\" while \\"crooner Frank Ocean chimes in with a vocal hook\\". The track is \\"delivered with sweetly juvenile expressions of desire, except that Tyler peppers the track with a single-word epithet that would earn him a kick in the groin from any self- respecting woman.\\" HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that \\"even the more subdued songs like \\"She\\" with Frank Ocean\\" embody \\"Tyler‚Äôs middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and ‚Äústabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus‚Äù into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism.\\" Though it was noted that even \\"She\\" has \\"passing moments of lyrical humanity to go with the pliant music (\\"When I'm with my friends I just put on a front / But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about 'we'\\"), The Village Voices Eric Harvey wrote that the \\"sinuous Frank Ocean feature \\"She\\" ramps up the voyeurism\\" and that he \\"keeps things within a Rear Window framework. He admits he's going through the dating motions strictly to get laid, but he also says that his violent front is just a show for his boys.\\" The song was featured on Tyler's first studio album titled Goblin, in which \\"She\\" was released as the fourth single from that album. Reception \\"She\\" received positive reviews from most music critics. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef commented that while Goblin \\"could have used an editor\\", \\"the highs are very high: \\"She\\" work as standalones away from the album as a whole.\\" Source writer Kazeem commented \\"Tyler links up with fellow breakout star of the OFWGKTA, Frank Ocean, where the in demand crooner spits a couple of better-than-it has-any-right-being 16 bars, while seamlessly weaving into a haunting hook.\\" Craig Jenkin's Prefix magazine mused that the \\"jazzy chord progression and syrupy vocals from Odd Future associate Frank Ocean sneakily conceal its stalker vibe and crass lyrical conceit.\\" AbsolutePunks Ian Walker praised Ocean on the track, writing: \\"his verse and chorus showcase both sides of his expertise, as he can write both hip-hop and R&B; influenced vocals with ease. While ‚ÄúShe‚Äù tends to get lost in the midst of heavier tracks like ‚ÄúYonkers‚Äù and ‚ÄúTransylvania,‚Äù it deserves a ton of recognition for leaning a bit more towards a mainstream sound Odd Future isn't known for while staying true to their original vision.\\"Walker, Ian 2011-05-11.

NMEs Louis Pattison described the track as a \\"curdled take on silky ‚Äô70s rare groove legend Roy Ayers\\" and stated that it was \\"actually rather gorgeous\\". Tiny Mix Tapes commented however that Tyler's \\"flow is painful to listen to on slower tracks such as \\"She\\" thought [it] was saved by his ambition [in] production\\". Max Feldman of PopMatters noted that Tyler \\"also does a lot of thinking through the medium of his own genitals, as evidenced on lusty R&B; crooner \\"She\\" where he lets his perverse side free.\\" Music video Tyler and Ocean performing together in 2012 The music video for \\"She\\" was shot in Los Angeles.

The story is set in Prague in the 1940s, during the Nazi occupation and early communism, and follows a young man who alternately gets into trouble and has successes. Hrabal wrote the book during a period of censorship in the early 70s. It began circulating in 1971,http://www.antikvariaty.cz/index.php?action=ShowPicture&id;=61767 and was formally published in 1983. It was adapted into a 2006 film with the same title, directed by Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel, a noted director of the Czech New Wave. Plot summary The novel is narrated in the first person and follows the life of D√≠tƒõ (a name meaning \\"child\\" in Czech), an aspiring hotelier. He is rather short, which causes him to have an inferiority complex; he goes to great lengths to disguise this perceived flaw. At the beginning of the novel, D√≠tƒõ is starting out as a busboy at the Golden Prague Hotel, which, despite its name, is located in the countryside. It is here that D√≠tƒõ begins his fascination with both women and money, trends that will continue and develop throughout much of the novel. He begins spending his paychecks at the local brothel and enjoys decorating prostitutes' laps with flower petals. His disapproving boss eventually finds out about his habit and puts a stop to it. The next hotel he works at is a grand estate, but it is almost always empty. In one satirical scene, however, the hotel receives a visit from the President of the country (presumed to be Tom√°≈° Masaryk) and his French lover. The next hotel D√≠tƒõ works at is in Prague itself. Here, D√≠tƒõ works as a waiter, honing his skills of perception under the watchful tutelage of the headwaiter. When the Emperor of Ethiopia comes to Czechoslovakia for a state visit, he dines at the hotel, and D√≠tƒõ is awarded a special medal for his diligent service, an honor which he wears proudly many times throughout the novel. After the dinner, however, D√≠tƒõ is accused of having stolen a golden spoon that went missing. Ashamed, he attempts to hang himself, but is saved at the last minute when the spoon is found. D√≠tƒõ's time at the hotel comes to an end after the beginning of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. D√≠tƒõ's girlfriend, Lise, is an ethnic German as well as an ardent Nazi supporter, and while he never sympathizes with her political beliefs, D√≠tƒõ comes to resent the bad treatment that she receives at the hands of Czechs, including at the restaurant he works. After an altercation with his coworkers over this issue, he is fired. D√≠tƒõ marries Lise, and together they move to a Nazi mountain retreat for pregnant \\"Aryan\\" women. Though he attempts to pass as Aryan himself, the other Germans treat him with condescension and disdain; he must get a dispensation from the doctor in order to be able to impregnate his wife, submitting to a humiliating physical exam in the process. When they eventually do have a child, their son is born retarded, and spends the day hammering nails into the floor. After expressing doubts about the German invasion of the Soviet Union, D√≠tƒõ is fired; he works as a waiter in a caf√© in Prague while Lise works at the front lines. Near the end of the war, Lise is killed in the bombing of Cheb. In the rubble, D√≠tƒõ finds a briefcase full of stamps stolen from a Jewish ghetto. He sells the stamps and uses the proceeds to build his own hotel in an abandoned quarry. Among his guests is John Steinbeck. The fame and wealth he amasses fulfill the dreams of his youth, and yet his status as a Nazi collaborator leaves him alienated from Prague's other hoteliers. After the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia, the hotel is nationalized, and D√≠tƒõ is thrown into \\"millionaire's prison,\\" in which the inmates live in high style and have access to all the luxuries they had on the outside. After the prison is closed down, D√≠tƒõ works a brief stint at a lumber mill before securing himself a job as a road repairer in the isolated mountains. He lives largely isolated from the world, save for the company of a few animals. Here, D√≠tƒõ trades his youthful pursuit of temporal pleasures for quiet contemplation and spiritual growth. He comes to accept himself, overcoming the insecurity he felt throughout his life. The book ends with D√≠tƒõ describing how he started to write the novel in the first place. Reception James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001: \\"I Served the King of England is a joyful, picaresque story, which begins with Baron Munchausen-like adventures, and ends in tears and solitude, a modulation typical of Hrabal's greatest work.\\" Adaptation After the fall of communism, the Czech filmmaker Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel attempted to make a film from I Served the King of England. Menzel had in the past directed several films based on Hrabal's stories, such as Closely Watched Trains and Larks on a String. The struggle to get the film made in the transformed film industry became much publicized, and culminated in 1998, when Menzel, after hearing his producer had sold the rights, attacked the producer at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and beat him with a big stick. The stick was later sold at auction. The film rights were passed between different producers, and at one point the story was under development to be turned into a television soap opera. In the early 2000s, a film was under development by the writer-director duo Petr Jarchovsk√Ω and Jan H≈ôebejk. In the end Menzel did direct the film. A co-production between Czech, Slovak, German and Hungarian companies, I Served the King of England premiered in the Czech Republic on 21 December 2006.

Liu. \\"A G space theory and a weakened weak (W2) form for a unified formulation of compatible and incompatible methods: Part I theory and Part II applications to solid mechanics problems\\". International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 81: 1093‚Äì1126, 2010 is used in the formulation of general numerical methods based on meshfree methods and/or finite element method settings. These numerical methods are applicable to solid mechanics as well as fluid dynamics problems. Description For simplicity we choose elasticity problems (2nd order PDE) for our discussion.Liu, G.R. 2nd edn: 2009 Mesh Free Methods, CRC Press. 978-1-4200-8209-9 Our discussion is also most convenient in reference to the well-known weak and strong form. In a strong formulation for an approximate solution, we need to assume displacement functions that are 2nd order differentiable. In a weak formulation, we create linear and bilinear forms and then search for a particular function (an approximate solution) that satisfy the weak statement. The bilinear form uses gradient of the functions that has only 1st order differentiation. Therefore, the requirement on the continuity of assumed displacement functions is weaker than in the strong formulation. In a discrete form (such as the Finite element method, or FEM), a sufficient requirement for an assumed displacement function is piecewise continuous over the entire problems domain. This allows us to construct the function using elements (but making sure it is continuous a long all element interfaces), leading to the powerful FEM. Now, in a weakened weak (W2) formulation, we further reduce the requirement. We form a bilinear form using only the assumed function (not even the gradient). This is done by using the so-called generalized gradient smoothing technique,Liu GR, \\"A Generalized Gradient Smoothing Technique and the Smoothed Bilinear Form for Galerkin Formulation of a Wide Class of Computational Methods\\", International Journal of Computational Methods Vol.5 Issue: 2, 199‚Äì236, 2008 with which one can approximate the gradient of displacement functions for certain class of discontinuous functions, as long as they are in a proper G space.Liu GR, \\"On G Space Theory\\", International Journal of Computational Methods, Vol. 6 Issue: 2, 257‚Äì289, 2009 Since we do not have to actually perform even the 1st differentiation to the assumed displacement functions, the requirement on the consistence of the functions are further reduced, and hence the weakened weak or W2 formulation. History  The development of systematic theory of the weakened weak form started from the works on meshfree methods. It is relatively new, but had very rapid development in the past few years. Features of W2 formulations  #The W2 formulation offers possibilities for formulate various (uniformly) \\"soft\\" models that works well with triangular meshes. Because triangular mesh can be generated automatically, it becomes much easier in re-meshing and hence automation in modeling and simulation. This is very important for our long-term goal of development of fully automated computational methods. #In addition, W2 models can be made soft enough (in uniform fashion) to produce upper bound solutions (for force- driving problems). Together with stiff models (such as the fully compatible FEM models), one can conveniently bound the solution from both sides. This allows easy error estimation for generally complicated problems, as long as a triangular mesh can be generated. This is important for producing so-called certified solutions. #W2 models can be built free from volumetric locking, and possibly free from other types of locking phenomena. #W2 models provide the freedom to assume separately the displacement gradient of the displacement functions, offering opportunities for ultra-accurate and super-convergent models. It may be possible to construct linear models with energy convergence rate of 2. #W2 models are often found less sensitive to mesh distortion. #W2 models are found effective for low order methods Existing W2 models  Typical W2 models are the smoothed point interpolation methods (or S-PIM).Liu, G.R. 2nd edn: 2009 Mesh Free Methods, CRC Press. 978-1-4200-8209-9 The S-PIM can be node-based (known as NS-PIM or LC-PIM),Liu GR, Zhang GY, Dai KY, Wang YY, Zhong ZH, Li GY and Han X, \\"A linearly conforming point interpolation method (LC-PIM) for 2D solid mechanics problems\\", International Journal of Computational Methods, 2(4): 645‚Äì665, 2005. edge-based (ES-PIM),G.R. Liu, G.R. Zhang. \\"Edge-based Smoothed Point Interpolation Methods\\". International Journal of Computational Methods, 5(4): 621‚Äì646, 2008 and cell-based (CS- PIM).G.R. Liu, G.R. Zhang. \\"A normed G space and weakened weak (W2) formulation of a cell-based Smoothed Point Interpolation Method\\". International Journal of Computational Methods, 6(1): 147‚Äì179, 2009 The NS-PIM was developed using the so-called SCNI technique.Chen, J. S., Wu, C. T., Yoon, S. and You, Y. (2001). \\"A stabilized conforming nodal integration for Galerkin mesh-free methods\\". International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering. 50: 435‚Äì466. It was then discovered that NS-PIM is capable of producing upper bound solution and volumetric locking free.G. R. Liu and G. Y. Zhang. Upper bound solution to elasticity problems: A unique property of the linearly conforming point interpolation method (LC-PIM). International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 74: 1128‚Äì1161, 2008. The ES-PIM is found superior in accuracy, and CS-PIM behaves in between the NS-PIM and ES-PIM. Moreover, W2 formulations allow the use of polynomial and radial basis functions in the creation of shape functions (it accommodates the discontinuous displacement functions, as long as it is in G1 space), which opens further rooms for future developments. The S-FEM is largely the linear version of S-PIM, but with most of the properties of the S-PIM and much simpler. It has also variations of NS-FEM, ES-FEM and CS-FEM. The major property of S-PIM can be found also in S-FEM.Zhang ZQ, Liu GR, \\"Upper and lower bounds for natural frequencies: A property of the smoothed finite element methods\\", International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Vol. 84 Issue: 2, 149‚Äì178, 2010 The S-FEM models are: * Node-based Smoothed FEM (NS-FEM)Liu GR, Nguyen-Thoi T, Nguyen-Xuan H, Lam KY (2009) \\"A node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM) for upper bound solutions to solid mechanics problems\\".

History The refinery is in Tema, the most industrialized city in Ghana. It is from Accra, the capital of Ghana. The refinery was first named the Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Company (GHAIP). It was licensed as a private limited liability company in 1960 as a fully owned Italian company - ANIC Societa per Azioni and AGIP Societa per Azioni of Italy were its major shareholders. In 1977, the Government of Ghana became the sole shareholder. The name of the refinery was changed to the Tema Oil Refinery in 1991. TOR is authorized by law to operate both as a refiner of crude oil and seller of petroleum products. Capacity Annually, of refined petroleum products are used in the Ghanaian economy. The refinery's production reduces the cost of petroleum products imported into the country. Ghana started commercial production of crude oil in December, 2010. The country's Jubilee oil field produces the high grade 'Sweet Light' oil. The installation processes of crude oil daily. However, TOR was built to process lower grade crudes and cannot refine oil from the new local fields unless significant investment was made. An engineer at the oil field said the costs of retrofitting required to cope with the higher grade oil (approximately $1 billion) was prohibitive, and that it was unlikely that the investment would ever be made. The refinery has an output capacity of about 6,138 metric tonnes per day. TOR underwent the first phase of a major rehabilitation in 1989. The second phase began in April 1990 at an estimated cost of US$36 million. The aim of the rehabilitation is to improve distribution of liquefied petroleum gas, and increase its supply from per day. Construction on the new Tema-Akosombo oil products pipeline, designed to carry refined products from Tema to Akosombo Port, began in January 1992. From there, oil is to be transported across Lake Volta to northern regions.Clark, Nancy L. \\"Petroleum Exploration\\". A Country Study: Ghana (La Verle Berry, editor).

These replaced three old boilers of total capacity of per day which had been installed in 1963. TOR debts The Government of Ghana in 2010 paid all the debt owed to Ghana Commercial Bank.

The history of rail transport in Tanzania began in the late nineteenth century. Zanzibar A train on the Bububu railway. From about 1880 to 1888, a tramway operated in Zanzibar, then ruled by the second Sultan of Zanzibar, Barghash bin Said. In 1905, a second tramway was built, this time by a US company. It lasted until 1930. Tanganyika Railway line in Tanzania; red: Tanzania Railways; orange: TAZARA = German colonial period = A train passing over a bridge across the Ruvu river during the day time. The first railway lines in Tanganyika, known at the time as German East Africa, were built soon after the first tramway in Zanzibar. In 1891, the Eisenbahngesellschaft f√ºr Deutsch-Ostafrika (English: Railway Company for German East Africa) was established, with the goal of building a railway from Tanga in Tanganyika to the hinterland. For that, and subsequent, main lines in the German colony, the gauge selected was . In addition, light railways were developed for individual Tanganyikan sisal plantations in narrower gauges, usually gauge. The construction of the Usambara Railway, from Tanga to the hinterland, began in 1893. However, the company building that railway went into bankruptcy after two years. At that stage, only of track had been completed, as far as Korogwe. The treasury of the colony then took over the project in 1899. Four years later, in 1903, it issued an Order for further construction. Subsequently, there were other attempts to operate the railway on an economically and juristically stable footing. In 1904, the smaller railways received a boost. Meanwhile, in Germany, the Sigi-Eisenbahngesellschaft (English: Sigi Railway Company) was established, with the objective of constructing one of the narrow gauge railways branching off the Usambara Railway, the Sigi-Bahn,:de:Sigi-Bahn in gauge. The same year, 1904, the Ostafrikanische Eisenbahngesellschaft (English: East African Railway Company) (OAEG) was formed to promote a railway from Dar es Salaam in the direction of Lake Tanganyika, the Zentralbahn (English: Central Line). Kigoma was reached on 2 February 1914, on the eve of World War I. Later in 1914, work began on the Ruandabahn,:de:Ruandabahn a line from Tabora in the territory that was later to become Rwanda. This project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War I. =East African Campaign= During World War I, German and Allied forces engaged in the East African Campaign, a series of battles and guerrilla actions which started in German East Africa. Towards the end of 1915, the Allies decided to build a railway from Voi, Kenya, a station on the Uganda Railway, to Maktau, as a supply route for a full-scale invasion of the German colony, including an offensive down the Usambara Railway to Tanga. Subsequently, the line was extended to Kahe, a station on the Usambara Railway near Moshi, Tanganyika. As both the Uganda Railway and the Usambara Railway were metre gauge, the transfer of vehicles from one of these lines to the other thus became readily achievable. By September 1916, both the Usambara Railway and the Central Line from the coast at Dar es Salaam to Ujiji were fully under Allied control. =British mandate= After the Armistice in 1918, the British occupied Tanganyika was granted to the United Kingdom as a League of Nations mandate. On 1 April 1919, the new colonial administration established Tanganyika Railways and Port Services as the operator of the railways in the mandated territory. In 1928, the Tabora‚ÄìMwanza railway was completed with the assistance of the German pre war preparations for the Ruandabahn. In 1930, the Usambara Railway was extended to Arusha. In 1948, a branch line from the Central Line was opened between Msagali and Hororo, and in 1949/1950 the Kaliua‚ÄìMpanda line was opened. As early as 1951, the line to Hororo was closed. In 1948, Tanganyika Railways and Port Services was merged with its counterparts in Uganda and Kenya to form the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (from 1969: East African Railways Corporation). From 1950, the Overseas Food Corporation established the Southern Province Railway in the south of Tanganyika. It linked the port of Mikindani with the growing regions for the Tanganyika groundnut scheme in the hinterland. Eventually the network reached a total length of more than . In 1952, it was transferred to the East African Railways and Harbours Administration. Republic of Tanzania A TAZARA passenger train at the Mbeya railway station during the day time. In a series of steps between 1961 and 1964, Tanganyika became independent and united with Zanzibar in a federation. Meanwhile, the existing network was expanded. In 1963, a coastal railway was constructed to link the Central and the Usambara Railway, and in 1965 a branch line was opened southwards, from Kilosa, on the Central Line, to Kidatu. In 1963, the narrow gauge network in southern Tanganyika was shut down. From 1964, discussions took place about a proposed railway line between Tanzania and Zambia. As Great Britain had not shown any interest in the proposal, the People's Republic of China joined in. The PRC government sponsored construction of the railway specifically to eliminate Zambia's economic dependence on Rhodesia and South Africa.Thomas W. Robinson and David L. Shambaugh. Chinese Foreign Policy: theory and practice, 1994. Page 287. The contractual foundations were closed in 1967, and one year later, the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) was established, as a condominial railway:de:Kondominalbahn owned by Tanzania and Zambia. The TAZARA was built in which was new for Tanzania, but common in southern Africa. The line was handed over to the company as it was completed in sections in 1973 and 1974. In 1976, a branch line was opened to Kitadu, where the metre gauge branch line from the Central Line ends. In 1977, in light of the different policies and widening standards of economic development in its participating countries, the East African Union broke up, and all of its joint structures were also dissolved. The Tanzanian Railways - except the TAZARA - was reorganised as Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC). Economically, the network then went constantly downhill, due to increasing road traffic, corruption and political neglect. A number of rail links, such as between Arusha and Moshi, were shut down, and passenger services abandoned, including on the Usambara Railway. The TAZARA has been a major economic conduit in the region. However, it has never been profitable and more recently it has suffered from competition from road transport (such as the Trans‚ÄìCaprivi Highway and Walvis Bay Corridor to Namibia) and the re-orientation of Zambia's economic links towards South Africa after the end of apartheid.Seat 61 website accessed 20 February 2007 As of October 2008, a Tanzanian newspaper described the TAZARA's condition as being \\"on the verge of collapse due to financial crisis\\", with the operator being three months late on paying worker's wages and most of its 12 locomotives being out of service.\\"Save the 'Uhuru Railway' from collapse\\" \\"This Day\\", Wednesday, October 29, 2008.

The concession agreement was signed on 3 September 2007, and began on 1 October 2007. The services previously operated by the TRC were run as Tanzania Railway Ltd, with the government owning a 49% stake.

Both nations share historic ties and have a long-standing special relationship, partly due to the Dutch colony in the Cape, linguistic similarity between Dutch and Afrikaans and the Netherlands‚Äô staunch support in the struggle against Apartheid. History =Dutch colonization= In 1652, the Dutch East India Company decided to establish a colony in the Cape of Good Hope (in present-day Cape Town) to use as a base for Dutch trade with Asia, particularly with its colony in Indonesia. A few years after the Dutch arrival to the Cape, the Khoikhoi‚ÄìDutch Wars began in 1659 and lasted until 1677. After the wars, the Dutch began further expansion inland. Soon afterwards, Dutch farmers known as Boers (Dutch for farmer) began arriving to the Cape region to settle and would become the forefathers of the Afrikaner people.The Dutch in South Africa In 1795, the Dutch Cape Colony became a British colony after the Battle of Muizenberg. The British decided to take the Cape Colony after the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under Napol√©on Bonaparte after France annexed the Netherlands. In 1802, the British returned the Cape Colony to the Dutch after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, however, in 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, a second British invasion re-occupied the colony after the Battle of Blaauwberg and it remained a British colony. In 1814 the Dutch government formally ceded sovereignty over the Cape to the British, under the terms of the Convention of London.Colonial expansion in South Africa after 1750 =Relations during Apartheid= In 1931, South Africa became an independent nation after the passing of the Statute of Westminster. In 1938, the Netherlands and South Africa officially established diplomatic relations. During World War II (1939-1945) both nations fought as allies. In 1948, the South African government, at the time representing only a small proportion of the population, erected a system of strict racial segregation and called it apartheid (separateness) which is a codified system of racial stratification which first began to take form in South Africa under the Dutch Empire in the late eighteenth century.The Netherlands against Apartheid 1948-1994 Initially, the Dutch government was neutral to the apartheid government in South Africa. South Africa was one of only a handful of United Nations member states to support the Dutch view that the issues the Netherlands faced concerning the decolonization of Indonesia and the Netherlands New Guinea were of a 'domestic' nature and that the UN had no right to interfere.The Netherlands against Apartheid - 1950s (1) In 1949, during the visit of South African Prime Minister Daniel Fran√ßois Malan to the Netherlands, Dutch Queen Juliana told her guest that she would \\"never set foot in his country as long as apartheid reigned\\". In 1959 the Dutch representative to the UN abstained from voting for an anti-apartheid resolution, apartheid being regarded \\"an internal affair\\" of South Africa.The Netherlands against Apartheid - 1950s (2) In March 1960, relations between the Netherlands and South Africa became tense after the Sharpeville massacre when South African police shot and killed 69 people. In 1961, the Netherlands was the only Western country to vote in favor of an anti-apartheid resolution in the UN.The Netherlands against Apartheid - 1960s (1) Soon, Dutch anti-apartheid movements called the \\"Anti-Apartheid Beweging Nederland\\" (AABN), and \\"Kommittee Zuidelijk Afrika\\" (KZA) (both later merged and converted themselves into the \\"Nederlands Instituut voor Zuidelijk Afrika\\" (NIZA)) began staging demonstrations and obtaining signatures to protest against the South African government in the Netherlands.Relations between South Africa and the Netherlands Further events in South Africa led the Dutch government to take more drastic measures such as requesting that all Dutch companies stop dealing with South Africa (however, Shell continued to operate in South Africa). In 1983, the Dutch government imposed visa requirements to South African nationals visiting the Netherlands.The Netherlands against Apartheid - 1980s (1) In February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving 27 years.

United season was the clubs' fifth year of existence, as well as their fourth season in Major League Soccer. Following shortcomings in MLS Cup '98, United took winning the league championship as their top priority entering 1999. With Bruce Arena's departure to coach the United States men's national team, Dutch coach Thomas Rongen took the helm as United head coach. Rongen's maiden campaign with United proved by incredibly successful, as United earned their third MLS Cup title, and their second MLS Supporters Shield. The success of the league double culminating two previous MLS Cups, a Supporters Shield and the CONCACAF Champions' Cup was considered the apex of being tie-free until the mid to late 2000s. Their dominance in the league was cut short the year following strict salary cap restrictions enforced by MLS to ensure parity amongst clubs. Consequently, it resulted in certain core United players becoming too expensive for the club to retain, weakening the squad. With the subsequent changes to the 1999 season, United would not qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs again until 2003.

He was born in Box, Wiltshire and was educated at City of Bath Boys School and the University of Bristol, graduating with a first class honours BSc in 1927. He stayed on there as a student demonstrator, doing research on the loading of gaseous ions by polar molecules. In 1929, he joined the Meteorological Office at Kew Observatory, where he carried out studies on the atmospheric electrical balance in good and bad weather. In 1932 he was one of a six-man British expedition to Fort Rae in Northwest Canada, where he carried out observations of atmospheric electricity. The following year he was posted to the Chemical Warfare Experimental Station at Porton Down in Wiltshire, where he spent five years studying air motion in the boundary layer (the first few 100 metres above the earth's surface). In 1939 he was appointed a reader in Meteorology at Imperial College but when war broke out was seconded to the Air Ministry to set up a Meteorological Office Training School in London to train weather forecasters. After the war, he returned to Imperial College, where he helped Professor David Brunt establish a teaching programme for the Diploma of Imperial College and the University of London Master of Science degree, eventually succeeding him as Professor in 1952. He continued his work on atmospheric motion in the boundary layer, but gradually became more involved in committee work and lecturing. In 1939 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and served as a council member, editor of the Quarterly Journal, vice-president and President (1957‚Äì59). In 1963 he was honoured for his lifetime's work with the society's Symons Gold Medal and with the award of a CBE. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1964. He died in 1977.

It is now best known for the short story of the same name by Mary Shelley, published posthumously in 1863, drawn from the story. Hoax A French newspaper story, published on 28 June 1826, reported \\"a most extraordinary event\\": a man, around thirty years old, had been discovered buried under a pile of ice in the Alps. On pulling the body out and bathing it in warm water, the man woke up, and declared himself to be Roger Dodsworth, son of the antiquarian Roger Dodsworth, born in 1629 and buried under an avalanche in 1660. The story appeared in translation in a London paper a week later, and from there was widely picked up by the British press.Robinson, p. 21. The first appearance in London was in the New Times, quoted in Robinson, but it is not clear if they themselves invented the French story, allegedly taken from the Journal du Commerce de Lyon. No available source appears to quote a French original. The story circulated through various newspapers, gaining embellishments on the way, with the Scotsman suggesting bathing in milk as an antidote to century- old stiff joints, and John Bull reporting that Dodsworth himself had arrived in London. In mid-July, the story gained a satirical dimension, with a poem by Thomas Moore published in the Times characterising the long-dead Dodsworth as a perfect Tory, \\"a good obsolete man, who never of Locke or Voltaire has been a reader\\".Robinson, pp. 22-23 In the Sun, William Cobbett contributed a spurious story of a man who had fallen into a coma in a frozen pond in Westmoreland for three hours.Robinson, p. 22 In September, by which time the story was widely understood to be a hoax, a series of letters were published in John Bull claiming to be from Dodsworth, written in a deliberately archaic style.Robinson, pp. 23-24 Other letters included a \\"correction\\" in the New Monthly Magazine.\\"Letter from the Gentleman Preserved in Ice\\". New Monthly Magazine, issue 67 vol 17, 1826, pp. 453-458; Robinson, p. 25 The third and final letter was published in November, at which point the hoax disappeared from the press.Robinson, pp. 25-26 Short story During the widespread interest in Dodsworth in September, Mary Shelley had written a letter which she submitted to the New Monthly Magazine; in it, writing as Dodsworth, she arranged the story so that he returned to Switzerland to die.Robinson, p. 25 The article was probably written in a hurry in order to capitalise on the story; Shelley was known to have submitted a number of other pieces to the magazine, though only one has been definitely identified.Robinson, pp. 27-28 In the event, however, it was not published, though it is not clear why one was chosen over the other; as the two contradict each other, they could not both have been used.Robinson, p. 26 The story was later resurrected after Shelley's death, and published in 1863 with a preface by the editor explaining that \\"I did not use it for the purpose originally intended...\\".Robinson, p. 25 Shelley had considered the idea of a reawakened historical figure as the basis for a tragic story some years earlier, with the unfinished Valerius, about a citizen of the Roman Republic awakened in the nineteenth century. Her father had likewise drawn on the legend of the Seven Sleepers in Mandeville. In the letter, however, she took the idea as a basis for humour rather than tragedy.Markley, p. 111-114 She later returned to the idea in \\"The Mortal Immortal,\\" a story about a man who had become immortal by accident and wished to die.

The inedible fruits are orange, only about long, and contain seeds. The species is cultivated for its ornamental value, being grown, for example, along with heliconias in commercial farms in Hawaii. It does not tolerate temperatures below , so in temperate zones requires protection during the winter months. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. M. coccinea is a known host in the New World of the red palm mite (Raoiella indica). Taxonomy Flower Musa coccinea was described by Andrews in 1799. M. uranoscopos Lour. (an illegitimate name) is often incorrectly given as a synonym. Loureiro's 1790 account is confused. He refers to an illustration in Rumphius' 1747 Herbarium Amboinense, hence this is the type of his name. However, this illustration had previously been used in Linnaeus' description of M. troglodytarum, so M. uranoscopos Lour. is a superfluous name for M. troglodytarum. Loureiro's description of M. coccinea; however the type rather than the description determines the synonymity, so M. uranoscopos Lour. is not a synonym of M. coccinea.

It was erected in 1737 by the Portuguese, having abandoned the attempt at building a fort in Maldonado. It was constructed of large, heavy stones to create the tall towers (four bastions), thick walls and sturdy ramparts to withstand the onslaught of wars fought against the Spanish invaders which was instrumental in Uruguay evolving as an independent nation. Geography The fort is located on Route 19, south of the Laguna Merin, and west of Chuy. Visible after passing Paso de Punta Segra, it is situated on top of the Sierra de San Miguel, thirty-five metres high, in an area of mostly large and extensive valleys. At the foot of the mountain runs the San Miguel River, though it is out of sight of the fortress. In the distance are mountains forming the boundary with Brazil. History With a garrison of 100 men, the fort was used by the Portuguese as an observation post of the movements of the Spanish forces. Article XVIII of the Treaty of Madrid (1750) decided that Portugal would keep the line of Castillos Grande, and could strengthen it. Before the signing of the Treaty of El Pardo (1761), the governor and captain-general of the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, Gomes Freire de Andrade, anticipated the consequences for the South and ordered the governor of the Colony of Rio Grande de S√£o Pedro, Colonel El√≥i Madureira, to immediately dispatch troops to the Laguna region. The Portuguese strategy was to quickly build a fortified defensive line, south of Fort San Miguel, to stop the Spanish invasion in progress, after the conquest of Colonia del Sacramento in October 1762 by Governor Pedro de Cevallos of Buenos Aires. Main gate of Fuerte San Miguel In October 1762, construction of the Fortaleza de Santa Teresa began nearby to surpass San Miguel as the main Portuguese stronghold. In April 1763, Ceballos took San Miguel and the Spanish improved it considerably into a fully functioning fort. In 1775 engineer Bernardo Lecocq made reinforcement works to the structure of the fort, with a British invasion imminent. With the Treaty of San Ildefonso (1777), the Spanish were legally confirmed as being in possession of the fort. In 1797, the fort reached its peak as a stronghold when it was strengthened further, again in anticipation of war. After Uruguayan independence in 1828, the fort was deactivated and abandoned, becoming a ruin over time. By 1891, the fort was covered with plants, forming cracks; in one corner, a mountain palm (Cocos australis) was growing. Architecture Initially designed as a simple defence base, building started on 17 October 1737 by the Portuguese (although the monument itself implies it was built between 1734 and 1737), attributing its construction to the military engineer Brigadier Jos√© da Silva Pais and the Portuguese military architect Manuel Gomes Pereira, later replaced by Captain Antonio Teixeira Carvalho. The fort is of smaller proportions than the neighbouring Fortaleza de Santa Teresa, being of lesser quality and irregular finishing due to the lack of granite stones available. The initial plan had the shape of a rectangular stone polygon with two pentagonal bastions on the shorter sides at the corners, separated by curtains, and topped by watchtowers. By 1740, the base had developed, featuring a star format with four bastions pentagonal vertices in Vauban style, with internal walls and service buildings erected in irregular stonework. There was a chapel on the mound, and on one of its sides, there is a deep well. The perimeter of the walls total . ;Grounds Access to the fort was by a drawbridge over a flooded moat. In one of the slopes of the hill that is covered with living vegetation, there is a notable outpost; facing to the east, it includes a wall with a small window, but its appearance is natural, like a cave or animal shelter. ;Reconstruction However, over the years after the independence of Uruguay, the fort's walls started crumbling as it remained untended. Uruguayans, proud of the historical heritage of the fort of more than 300 years for the founding of Uruguay as an independent nation, decided to get the hill top fort restored in 1927. The history and structure of the fort were thus rescued by a committee composed of Gen. Alfredo R. Campos, General Alfredo Baldomir and historian Horacio Arredondo, which began operating in 1927. In 1933, the fort was rebuilt according to original plans, using the techniques of the time, restoring the premises of the Command House, the Parliament House, the chapel, kitchen and Troop Barracks. The fort was declared a National Monument of Uruguay in 1937, thereafter to promote the recovery process. As a protected area, the diverse natural ecosystems has also been retained where native wildlife of Monkeys, birds, capybaras and guazubira are seen in the forests and marshland. Features Under the administration of the Army, the structure is permanently open to visitors, harbouring a Museum of Military History, which highlights the collection of historical uniforms of the garrison, and the sample of the historical evolution of Army uniforms. A series of watercolors by artist Emilio Regal√≠a are on display. Near the fort is the inn, Hosteria Fortin de San Miguel, a 1945 building built in the Spanish colonial style with 20 rooms and a ballroom that can accommodate 150 people.

It is the only motorway in Ghana. History The highway was opened to traffic in November 1965 to link the harbour city of Tema to Accra. It was built under the administration of Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana. Its construction was fashioned after the Autobahn in Germany and was purposed to be the first in motorway systems that would link major towns and cities in Ghana. Street lights A major problem that existed on the motorway was that of poor illumination. The motorway had no street lights when it was completed in 1964. In June 2002, the Ghana News Agency reported that the Government of Ghana was to spend 1.95 million cedis to light up the motorway. The project was to commemorate the country's Golden Jubilee in 2007. The project had challenges that delayed its completion of the Accra‚ÄìTema Motorway. It was suspended due to cable thefts. The problem led to plain-clothed policemen patrolling the motorway. Unfortunately, not all of the mounted street lights on the motorway are functional. Motorway campaigns In 2009, Adom FM, an Accra-based private radio station embarked on a campaign to educate users of the motorway on dangers that faced commuters on the multi-purpose highway. The education included the rampant criminal activities on the motorway, the unsafe bridges, the potholes, stolen side-rails, malfunctioning street lights, lack of reflectors, broken-down vehicles, and road safety. Rehabilitation of the motorway In August, 2009, rehabilitation work began on the road and was to cost 500,000 cedis. Part of the motorway was to be reconstructed using epoxy cement. The rehabilitation work took eight weeks and involved the removal and replacement of the concrete slabs which had developed potholes and the repair of the asphalt surface on shoulders of the road.

It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is a sequel to UFC Undisputed 2010, making it the third and last game to be released under THQ's 2007 agreement with the UFC. Gameplay UFC Undisputed 3 has improved and added changes from its predecessor, including the following: *New THQ servers for online play and downloadable content. Since the closing of THQ, the servers are now closed. *The addition of Pride Mode, with Pride rules, ring, and fighters. Pride Grand Prix has also been included, with the ability to have fights in the same night with damage moving onto the next fight. Commentary is provided by Bas Rutten and Stephen Quadros. Lenne Hardt announces the fighters in Pride in English. *A brand new submission system. New submission moves includes the standing rear naked choke, standing guillotine choke, and the flying scissor heel hook. *Motion capture used for fighters for more realistic movement. *New Stats: Footwork, Ground Grapple Top and Bottom for offense and defense. *Fighter entrances and music. *Two game play control options: traditional and simplified (Pro and Amateur controls). *Leg kick TKO's, including leg breaks from blocked kicks. *New KO animations. \\"Finish the Fight\\" allows you to continue punching an unconscious opponent until the referee pulls you off. *Damage recovery between rounds. *New Stamina system, where stamina can only come back up so far until you are fully rested. Cuts affect stamina and energy recovery rate. *Redesigned striking game emphasizing jabs, quick strikes, and combinations. Elbow spamming has been fixed, with only certain fighters having elbows in clinch range. A fighter's reach is now a big part in striking, and new feint system and takedown- intercepting knees have been added. *New clinch controls, including a new transition in the clinch to back control. Whip knees can be done to the body and can be blocked. *Stat decay removed in Career Mode, and roster fighters from the UFC and Pride can now be taken through career mode. *New ground positions with the cage, including using the cage to set up submissions and \\"wall walking\\" back to a standing position. *New options, such as Stamina Simulation mode, Competition Spec mode (removes all random elements such as flash KOs and doctor stoppages), and Stat Equalizer (equalizes all stats to 90 for both fighters). *Fighters are now able to sway on the ground to avoid strikes. *Sweeps are back from UFC 2009 Undisputed, including new ones. *Venues available includes MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, The O2, Bell Centre, Palms Casino Resort, and the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino. Madison Square Garden returns from UFC 2009 Undisputed. Pride matches are realised on Saitama Super Arena and WFA matches are realised at The Joint. *Mario Yamasaki, Herb Dean, Yves Lavigne, Josh Rosenthal, Dan Miragliotta and Kevin Mulhall are the referees available in the game. Development and release Promotion at E3 2011 The demo was released on 24 January 2012. Reception The game received \\"generally favourable reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four nines for a total of 36 out of 40. Dan Plunkett of 411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version nine out of ten and called it \\"the best game of the series and the best mixed martial arts video game to date.\\" Jeffrey Harris of the same website gave the PlayStation 3 version 9.6 out of 10 and said it was \\"really the MMA game we've been waiting for years. THQ really buckled down and the extra development time really paid off to make the game that much more special. EA MMA game [sic] was a good game, but it failed to deliver on a lot of levels and they didn't do enough to go above and beyond and truly outdo UFC Undisputed. THQ has now outdone all previous UFC Undisputed installments and EA MMA as well here.\\" A little later on, Trace Aber of the same website gave both console versions nine out of ten and said: \\"UFC Undisputed 3 is far and away the best game in the series, and it's obvious that taking a year off worked. The game certainly feels familiar, but it's the subtle things they changed that make the most difference. It's a well-rounded experience that is a must-have for any MMA fan.\\" The Digital Fix gave the PS3 version eight out of ten and called it \\"the definitive MMA game\\". Digital Spy gave the Xbox 360 version a similar score of four stars out of five, calling it \\"a thoroughly enjoyable fighting game, striking a wonderful balance between shallow action and simulation. Personality issues aside, once the bell rings, the action is superb, offering incredible levels of strategy, not to mention some of the most impressive knockouts we've ever seen.\\" Metro gave it a similar score of eight out of ten and called it \\"The premier MMA title that will appeal to all fight fans, whether you like the sport or not.\\" The game topped the UK sales charts for several weeks. Sequel On 5 June 2012, it was announced that THQ had sold the UFC license to Electronic Arts and closed the studio that worked on the franchise. A new title, EA Sports UFC, was released on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next-gen consoles on 17 June 2014, followed by a sequel in Spring 2016.

It is housed in the Mus√©e du Louvre of Paris. History The Parnassus was the first picture painted by Mantegna for Isabella d'Este's studiolo (cabinet) in the Ducal Palace of Mantua. The shipping of the paint used by Mantegna for the work is documented in 1497; there is also a letter to Isabella (who was at Ferrara) informing her that once back she would find the work completed. The theme was suggested by the court poet Paride da Ceresara. After Mantegna's death in 1506, the work was partially repainted to update it to the oil technique which had become predominant. The intervention was due perhaps to Lorenzo Leonbruno, and regarded the heads of the Muses, of Apollo, Venus and the landscape. Detail of Vulcan. Together with the other paintings in the studiolo, it was given to Cardinal Richelieu by Duke Charles I of Mantua in 1627, entering the royal collections with Louis XIV of France. Later it became part of the Louvre Museum. Description The traditional interpretation of the work is based on a late 15th-century poem by Battista Fiera, which identified it as a representation of Mount Parnassus, culminating in the allegory of Isabella as Venus and Francesco II Gonzaga as Mars. The two gods are shown on a natural arch of rocks in front a symbolic bed; in the background the vegetation has many fruits in the right part (the male one) and only one in the left (female) part, symbolizing the fecundation. The posture of Venus derives from the ancient sculpture. They are accompanied by Anteros (the heavenly love), opposed to the carnal one. The latter is still holding the arch, and has a blowpipe which aims at the genitals of Vulcan, Venus' husband, portrayed in his workshop in a grotto. Behind him is the grape, perhaps a symbol of the drunk's intemperance. Detail of Pegasus and Mercury. In a clearing under the arch is Apollo playing a lyre. Nine Muses are dancing, in an allegory of universal harmony. The touch of Pegasus's hoof (right) can generate the spring which fed the falls of Mount Helicon, which can be seen in the background. The Muses danced traditionally in wood of this mount, and thus the traditional naming of Mount Parnassus is wrong. Near Pegasus is Mercury, with his traditional winged hat, caduceus (the winged staff with entwined snakes), and messenger shoes. He is present to protect the two adulterers.

Career At the age of 20, Hellqvist was published in photos in the men's magazine Slitz wearing only a bikini bottom and a live boa constrictor around her upper body and was later voted Miss Slitz 2004 by readers. When her relationship with Prince Carl Philip was revealed in 2010, Expressen republished the photos. Following the Miss Slitz win, Hellqvist was cast in the Paradise Hotel reality show on TV4 where she made it to the final.
