Celadon techniques were first introduced from China; Goryeo potters established a native style by the 12th century. One of these native styles is characterized by the technique, a way of inlaying that was unique to Goryeo celadon. The color of the celadon, called for 'green', was also highly admired. The industry arose and declined as the Goryeo dynasty developed. Many wares were produced at the Gangjin Kiln Sites in southwestern Korea. An artist of the post-war era who specialised in Goryeo ware was Living National Treasure Yu Geun-Hyeong.British Museum ‚Äì Term details His work was documented in the short film Koryo Celadon in 1979.Koryo Celadon (1979) ‚Äì IMDb Many celadon pieces from Goryeo are listed as National Treasures of South Korea.  Goryeo celadon = History  Early celadon = An example of celadon made when production technology was not fully developed, having introduced from China. The color is yellowish brown. It is the only celadon of the Goryeo era that was found for which the production age, purpose, and maker are recorded together. Pottery and celadon had been introduced into the Korean peninsula in the Three Kingdom age. Demand for higher quality porcelain increased as the Goryeo Dynasty emerged. With that and the development of tea culture and Buddhism, wares based on traditional and southern China (Song dynasty) porcelain began production in Goryeo . Most of the pottery made in this era are the kinds that are called haemurigup celadon and green celadon (low-grade) = 11th century = As the celadon techniques of the Song dynasty reached its pinnacle, much effort was made inside Goryeo to reproduce the turquoise coloring of these Chinese porcelain. A lot of kilns were made throughout the kingdom, leading to a variety of celadon being made. High grade celadon were made in order of the capital, and low grade celadon were made by the requests of temples, offices and local families of provinces. Though Chinese influences were still existent, Goryeo styled shapes and decorations emerged in some porcelains. These are characterized by the utilization of light curves and a serene, elegant feel. Decoration techniques such as relief carving, intaglio carving, iron oxide glaze, openwork became in use. The sanggam inlaying also started at this age. = 12th century = Celadon gourd-shaped kettle : This work is balanced and gives a sense of stability. It is a typical pure celadon of the 12th century. The glaze and the foundation soil are translucent, clean, grey- green, and harmonious. The 12th century is considered as a zenith of Goryeo celadon, especially in its special color and harmony. The pure celadon made in this age had thin glaze coating that exquisitely reflected the jade color, called . They also had a great level of structural balance and elegance. There are records describing celadon of this age as world best.National Museum of Korea Jinsa \\"underglaze red\\", a technique using copper oxide pigment to create copper-red designs, was developed in Korea during the 12th century, and later inspired the \\"underglaze red\\" ceramics of the Yuan dynasty. = Post-12th century = Maturation of the aristocrat society due to events such as the coup of military officers leads to an increasing favor for extravagantly decorated porcelain. Inlaying techniques reach its height and opens a second zenith of Goryeo celadon. Other types of porcelain develop as whitening, iron oxide glaze, copper oxide glaze came in use. With the decrease of Chinese influence, Goryeo celadon acquires a more native shape, in unique patterns and decorative shapes. Thin, transparent glaze used to show the inlaid designs led to development of a crackling cooling pattern, called bingyeol (craquelure). = 13th century = After the Mongolian invasion in 1220, social and economic confusion had caused the general quality of Goryeo celadon to decline. Influence of Yuan dynasty is seen throughout the porcelain produced in this time. Though the celadon industry remained, overall density of expressions and smoothness decreased and the color and harmony are also diminished. This decrease in its beauty continues as the Goryeo dynasty recedes. = 14th century = In the late 14th Century, the Kilns of Gangjin and Buanyo were attacked by Japanese pirates and closed. Inland kilns replace them, putting an end to the age of celadon. Though new characteristic shapes and designs appear, they are utilitarian instead of being elegant and restrained, as Goryeo celadon in its zenith did. One of these new types of porcelain is called buncheong.  Characteristics  Goryeo celadon that uses Inlay technique. Several colors and patterns are shown. = Inlay technique = For the inlay technique, several patterns are engraved on the surface of metal, clay, wood, etc. Other materials such as gold, silver, jewelry, bone are inserted in the same shape. This traditional decoration technique started to be applied in porcelain in the Goryeo dynasty. Purple (black) and white clay were used to show the patterns. A pattern is engraved on celadon with a knife and covered with purple and white soil. When the soil dries, the overflowing mud is wiped off, remaining only in the carved areas; thus, a white or purple pattern will appear. When it is baked after painted with glaze, the white soil appears as white and the purple as black, and this pattern is seen through the glaze. = Differences from Chinese celadon = Cracks on Goryeo celadon Glaze of Goryeo celadon had a definite composition starting from the 11th century to the 15th century. It contained a lot of calcium in composition, with 0.5% of manganese oxide, which was more concentrated than glaze used in Chinese celadon. Also in the case of Chinese ceramics, there is enough time for nucleation-crystal growth, so it takes jade color. But the kilns in Goryeo were smaller than that in China, so the firing and cooling process took place quickly. Therefore, minerals in soil such as anorthite or wollastonite have no time for nucleation-crystal growth. This results in the color of celadon being closer to the gray side. In Goryeo celadon, quartz, black particles, bubbles, cracks can be observed too. The technical contribution of the celadon is that it has a white, black, or gray inlay to emphasize the grayish green color. In addition, when they used white inlay, the glaze was intentionally composited to make cracks. Light was scattered by the small cracks. So degrees of color of the celadon depend on the location of view. Pattern such as clouds, cranes, and flowers were placed on edges to exploit crack patterns. Although it was possible to make cracks with gray or black inlays, only white inlays were employed to make cracks.  Types and decorations  Goryeo ware plate * Pure celadon is celadon which has no decorations such as inlaid lights on it. It is known as the first type of celadon ever made in Korean Peninsula. Having no decorations, the shape of the bowl and the color of the glaze of this type of celadon are particularly excellent. It is considered to be the earliest celadon. * Celadon In relief refers to celadon made using embossing technique. There are two kinds of embossed celadon. The first is celadon which must be embossed to show its shape, and the other is celadon with embossing used for decorative purposes. * Incised Celadon is made by engraving technique, which shows patterns that enter the surface of the bowl. The engraved pattern in celadon is very thin, so if the glaze is not properly melted, the indented lines would not appear, which makes incised celadon require very high skill. It is seen in the excellent works of the early celadon. * Openwork celadon * Inlaid Celadon was made until the end of the Goryeo Dynasty. Many black and white patterns were embroidered. By using the method of digging the pattern with a sharp knife and then filling it with other colored clay, it is possible to express the pattern finely and to make the surface smoother. Cracks may appear because two different clays shrink together. * Willow and Waterfowl Design is used in many kinds of ceramics including celadon, and it reflects the feelings of the ancients very well. The characteristic of this design is that it contains a beautiful rural landscape, arranging black and white harmoniously. * Cloud and Crane Design was mainly used in prunus vases. This pattern of the sky expresses clouds and cranes that fly away from humans. It is not clear why people of Goryeo liked to use these designs. * Flower design is usually a pattern of camomile, and it can be added by a pair of chrysanthemums * Underglazed Celadon : The patterns of underglazed celadon are drawn with white & black paint on the surface of the bowl. The celadon is then painted with glaze and fired in a kiln. * Paste-on-paste Celadon uses clay on brushes to draw dots or pictures before applying glaze. It is similar to inlaid celadon, but the patterns are not smooth. * Copperized Celadon is red due to oxidation of copper. It is very rare and not numerous, because copper oxide is very unstable depending on the baking conditions such as temperature control and fuel supply, so it is very difficult to produce red color. * Celadon in Underglaze Iron is created by applying wire paints to the entire surface of pottery made by celadon clay. The finished work is shiny with black and green colors. * Gold decorated Celadon is made by the technique of painting a part of finished inlaid celadon with gold. Melted gold is painted in the pattern of the inlaid celadon which has been glazed and baked to the second fire. It is then baked again in low fire to let the gold settle. * Marbled Celadon is made by kneading grey celadon foundation clay with clays of other composition, the gray, black, and white color result in a marble pattern. No engraved patterns are found in marbled celadon.

The masses of locals in Egypt and the Middle East underwent a large scale gradual conversion from Christianity to Islam, accompanied by heavy taxes for those who refused to convert. This is attested to by John of Niki√ª, a coptic bishop who wrote about the conquest, and who was a near contemporary of the events he described. The process of Islamization was accompanied by a simultaneous wave of Arabization. These factors resulted in Islam becoming the dominant faith in Egypt between 10th and 12th century, Egyptians acculturating into an Islamic identity and then replacing Coptic and Greek, which were spoken as a result of the Greek and Roman occupation of Egypt, languages with Arabic as their sole vernacular which became the language of the nation by law.Clive Holes, Modern Arabic: structures, functions, and varieties, Georgetown University Press, 2004, , M1 Google Print, p. 29. The Hanging Church in Old Cairo Islamic links to Coptic Egypt predates its conquest by the Arabs. According to Muslim tradition, Mohammed married a Copt; Maria al- Qibtiyya. In 641 AD, Egypt was invaded by the Arabs who faced off with the Byzantine army. Local resistance by the Egyptians began to materialize shortly thereafter and would last until at least the ninth century.Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar (2 vols., Bulaq, 1854), by Al- MaqriziChronicles, by John of Niki√ª The Arabs imposed a special tax, known as jizya, for those who didn't want to accept Islam, the Christians who acquired the protected status of dhimmis, the taxation was justified on protection grounds since local Christians who kept their religion were never drafted to serve in an army. Arab rulers generally preferred not to share the rule with Coptic Christians in their towns and established new colonies, like Fustat. Heavy taxation at times of state hardships was a reason behind Coptic Christians organizing resistance against the new rulers. This resistance mounted to armed rebellions against the Arabs in a number of instances, such as during the Bashmurian revolt in the Delta. The Arabs in the 7th century seldom used the term Egyptian, and used instead the term qbt, which was adopted into English as Copt, to describe the locals of Egypt they kept using the term up until the Mamluk rule. Thus, Egyptians became known as Al Qibt, and the non-Chalcedonian Egyptian Church became known as the Coptic Church. The Chalcedonian Church remained known as the Melkite Church. In Coptic, which is written using a Greek alphabet, Coptic Egyptians referred to themselves as ‚≤õ‚≤ì‚≤£‚≤â‚≤ô‚≤õÃÄ‚≤≠‚≤è‚≤ô‚≤ì (/ni-rem-en-kƒìmi/ \\"Egyptians\\"). Religious life remained largely undisturbed following the establishment of Arab rule, as evidence by the rich output of Coptic Orthodox Christian arts in monastic centers in Old Cairo (Fustat) and throughout Egypt. Conditions, however, worsened shortly after that, and in the eighth and ninth centuries when Muslim rulers banned the use of human forms in art (taking advantage of an iconoclastic conflict in the European ruled Byzantium) and consequently destroyed many Coptic christian paintings mainly of Jesus and frescoes in churches.Kamil, p. 41 The Fatimid period in Egypt was a time of relative tolerance. The Fatimid rulers employed Copts in the government and participated in Coptic and local Egyptian feasts. Major renovation and reconstruction of churches and monasteries were also undertaken. Coptic arts flourished, reaching new heights in Middle and Upper Egypt.Kamil, op cit. See also * Islamization * Spread of Islam * Muslim conquests ReferencesSources  Kamil, Jill.

He held that statements of opinions can often involve statements of facts, because, \\"if the facts are not equally known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.\\" Bowen LJ said with his opinion the landlord \\"avers that the facts peculiarly within his knowledge are such as to render that opinion reasonable.\\" And it \\"amounts at least to an assertion that nothing has occurred in the relations between the landlords and the tenant which can be considered to make the tenant an unsatisfactory one... .

It also contains lists of names according to various categories, from authors and artists to schools and libraries.Blackwood's Edinburgh Review 1819 p. 237 Many of the writers listed were Romantics. The lists of authors continued after the 1823 into the annual diary as \\"A Chronological List of Eminent Persons in Letters, Philosophy, and the Arts, whose great original genius, individual character, or reputation with posterity, has had an influence in modifying the taste and opinions of the world\\".

Of some of the original matter, we cannot say much, except it may be intended (in a new sense) for the lovers of art.\\"The Literary Gazette 1828 p. 810 However, not everyone was in favour of the work; Keats, in a letter to his brother George, claimed that the work containing two of his own poems was \\"full of the most sickening stuff you can imagine\\".Holden 2005 qtd. p. 130 In 1930, Edmund Blunded stated, \\"This characteristic little invention was the now unprocurable Literary Pocket-Book, from the surviving sets of which it is to be wished that a facsimile might be published. It was at once practical and vacational [...] It must be concluded that this little Pocket-Book, for all Hunt's protests, [...] for all Keats's harsh comments [...] was a respectable worker in the cause of making the quality of Shelley and Keats known\\".Blunden 1930 pp. 137‚Äì138 He concluded that \\"It could be dreamed that there was a new England in which Leigh Hunt might for ever be employed in making Literary Pocket-Books for use, delight, and ornament, so that no fightful knocks on the door and final demand-notes might break upon his flowery and serene work of national importance.\\"Blunden 1930 pp. 138‚Äì139 Ann Blainey, in 1985, claimed, \\"Dear to Hunt's heart, it was an inoffensive calendar and memorandum book with original prose and poetry, fascinating anecdotes, and lists of practical or unusual facts to inspire and instruct his readers.\\"Blainey 1985 p. 112 NotesReferences * Anonymous \\"Literary Pocket-Book\\", Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine No XXXIII, Vol VI (December 1819). * Anonymous. \\"Sighs of Books\\", Literary Gazette and Journal... for the Year 1827.

It would serve the Red, Blue, and Orange Lines located beneath the North Central Expressway (U.S. 75) at Willis Avenue. DART's original system plan featured a tunnel underneath North Central Expressway, connecting Pearl Station and SMU/Mockingbird Station, with underground stations serving the Knox-Henderson and Cityplace neighborhoods. During construction of the tunnel in the 1990s, the station area for Knox‚ÄìHenderson Station was excavated at an additional cost of $1 million and left as a shell for future development. The excavated area was located below grade with a platform length of . Because of initial Vickery Place neighborhood objections, DART did not complete Knox‚ÄìHenderson Station as part of its initial phase as planned. The station's shell, considered a ghost station, serves as an emergency exit from the tunnel. The nearby underground Cityplace Station, of similar design, was finished as planned and opened in December 2000. By the mid-1990s, attitudes towards the station began to shift with the neighborhood actively petitioning DART to construct the station. However, funding problems related to the deferred construction doomed the station. By 2006, DART announced it would cost an estimated $100 million to complete and open Knox‚ÄìHenderson Station. The large price tag was attributed to the high labor and infrastructure costs associated with working underground near actively used tracks. In order to avoid interfering with existing rail service, tunneling and station construction work could only be carried out for four hours per day, between midnight and 4 a.m., when trains are not running. Due to the high costs involved, DART stated that it was deferring construction of the station indefinitely. In January 2007, DART published the final version of its comprehensive 2030 Transit System Plan. The plan contained no provisions for finishing or opening the station by 2030, and responded to public comments requesting completion of the station by declaring, \\"There are no plans for a station in the Knox-Henderson area.\\" , DART does not list Knox‚ÄìHenderson Station in its future expansion plans.

Actinoceratoidea, Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, part K.(Nautiloidea) Their range is from the upper Middle Ordovician to the Lower Silurian. Actinocerids are generally straight-shelled nautiloid cephalopods with a siphuncle composed of expanded segments, typically with thin connecting rings, in which the internal deposits are penetrated by a system of canals Actinoceratids are derived from Wutinoceras, possibly through an early Armenoceras or through NybyocerasFlower 1957.Studies of the Actinoceratida; Memoir 2; New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Socorro, NM and give rise to Lambeoceras and to the Huroniidae. Seven genera are included in the Actinoceratidae, Actinoceras, Floweroceras, Kochoceras, Leurorthoceras, Paractinoceras, Saffordoceras, and Troostoceras. Actinoceras is the earliest but with a range that carries it into the Lower Silurian. Troostoceras followed by Saffordoceras are later Middle Ordovician genera related to early Actinoceras. Kochoceras followed by Floweroceras are Upper Ordovian genera related to later Actinoceras. Leurothoceras and Paractinoceras, both from the Upper Ordovician, are shown to have their source in Middle Ordovician actinoceratids. Paractinoceras is probably the most distinct actinoceratid from Actinoceras. Paractinoceras has a long, straight, slender shell and a siphuncle that starts off like that in Actinoceras, but becomes narrow like that in Ormoceras in the anterior part of the phragmocone. Kochoceras has a large blunt shell that expands more rapidly than Actinoceras and is strongly flattened on the ventral side causing possible confusion with Lambeoceras to casual observation. Floweroceras is doubtfully distinct from Kochoceras. Leurothoceras is synonymous with Actinoceras; Saffordoceras and Troostoceras are closely related.

Career history The group was formed in 1939 by brothers Al Nevins (guitar) and Morty Nevins (accordion) and their cousin, radio and vaudeville veteran Artie Dunn (vocals, electronic organ). They became a popular nightclub attraction around New York; during an engagement in 1944, they were signed to appear in short musical films for the Soundies movie jukeboxes. They performed nine songs for the cameras. A review in Billboard in 1942 addressed the group's potential. Referring to a December 13, 1941, remote broadcast from New York's Hotel Piccadilly on NBC Red, Dick Carter wrote: \\"Here was something out of the ordinary, and very welcome, too. The Three Suns are an electric organ, an accordion and guitar, and they produce some sensational musical effects.\\" In 1944, The Three Suns scored their first hit record, \\"Twilight Time\\"; their version was strictly instrumental and did not feature the lyrics written later by Buck Ram.[ The Three Suns] at Allmusic \\"Twilight Time\\" sold over four million copies and was awarded a gold record. This was followed by \\"Peg o' My Heart\\", which was one of the best-selling records of 1947 in the United States. The group was featured in Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) performing an off-screen \\"radio sequence\\", and in Two Gals and a Guy (1951). The band is also notable in that they were reputed to have been the favorite musical group of former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower. During the 1950s, the group continued to make live appearances with the same personnel, but their RCA Victor recording sessions would often have studio musicians substituting for one or another, because keyboardist Artie Dunn did not read music and guitarist Al Nevins became much more interested in the production end of the record business. The group's popularity began to wane as rock and roll became popular in the mid 1950s, but the group reinvented itself by using its RCA Victor recording sessions as an audio laboratory, employing additional instruments and novel stereophonic effects. These new arrangements became popular among fans of lounge music and exotica. Al Nevins remained with RCA Victor as a producer and arranger until his death in 1965; Morty Nevins then hired studio musicians Fred Mendelssohn and Vinnie Bell and recorded a new stereo album for Musicor in 1966, using the Three Suns name. Founding member Al Nevins was also co-founder of Aldon Music, a Brill Building songwriting company.

The Three Suns recorded a number of sides for V-Disc in the 1940s, which were only issued by the US Government to the USO units overseas. These sides were reissued on a two-CD set in 1997 by IMC Licensing.

It is thought to be founded in the beginning of 2nd millennium AD. The size of the mound and the dimensions of its defence fortifications show that during the wars with Crusaders there was one of the strongest castles in ≈Ωemaitija and the centre of Kaltinƒónai land defence as well as administration on Kepalu≈°kalnis.  Remains of fortifications  The mound was founded on the edge of a highland, on a point formed by two hollows. Its hillsides are precipitous, to 20m in height. A 45 x 50m size upper ground was surrounded by bulwarks which are flattened now. Spurs, stone projectiles and other finds have been found in this ground. The north side of the mound was fortified with even 5 bulwarks and moats, first 3 of which also encircled the eastern and western hillsides. There was also a moat in the southern hillside, and the bulwark behind it had a 2-metre-high outer side. Nowadays, these fortifications can be seen only in the south-western part of the mound, others are destroyed. The mound was badly damaged by ploughing: most of the bulwarks and moats were flattened gradually. A homestead (now pulled down), located on the west side of the mound, also damaged the bulwarks. Cleaning works which took place in 2002-2004 were especially harmful for the mound historically: a path of stones leading to the upper ground was paved through the northern fortifications, and a parking lot was built where the 5th moat had once been. In 1990, J. Genys researched an area of 8,5m2 on the upper ground, but didn‚Äôt find any cultural layer.  Monument  In 1990, a wooden monument for Vytautas the Great and the remembrance of ≈Ωalgiris battle was built at the foot of the mound. The place for this monument was chosen not accidentally. While fighting for power and after becoming the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Vytautas visited ≈Ωemaitija a lot of times. It is also very likeable that he has been to Kaltinƒónai, which was one of the most important centres of ≈Ωemaitija in those times.  Use of the mound nowadays  On the top of Kepalu≈°kalnis, an altar of stones was built for the remembrance of castle protectors. Flags of Lithuania, ≈†ilalƒó and Tauragƒó often wave beside this altar. St John‚Äôs Day and other festivals are celebrated on this mound. Crowds of people gather there on these days, performances are given and bonfires are burnt.

From that time he was constantly employed in the queen's service. In 1580 and following years he was a commissioner for the repair and maintenance of Dover harbour. In 1587 he had command of a squadron before Dunkirk, and in 1588, in , commanded in the third post under Lord Henry Seymour in the \\"Narrow Seas\\", against the Spanish Armada. When this squadron joined the fleet under the lord admiral before Calais on 27 July, Palmer was sent to Dover to order out vessels suitable to be used for fireships. Before these could be sent, fireships, hastily improvised, drove the enemy from their anchorage, and Palmer, rejoining Seymour, took apart in the battle of Gravelines on the 29th. When Seymour, with the squadron of the Narrow Seas, was ordered back from the pursuit of the Spanish, Palmer returned with him, and continued with him and afterwards with the fleet till the end of the season. He remained in command of the winter guard on the coast of Flanders. Through the next year he continued to command in the Narrow Seas, and in September convoyed the army across to Normandy. He was employed in similar service throughout the war, his squadron sometimes cruising to the coast of Cornwall, or to Ireland, but remaining for the most part in the Narrow Seas, and in 1596 blockading Calais. On 20 December 1598 he was appointed Comptroller of the Navy, in place of William Borough, and in 1600 had command of the defences of the River Thames. In 1601 he again commanded on the coast of Holland. After the peace he continued in the office of comptroller at his office held at Chatham Dockyard overlooking the mast pools till his death. He died on 20 November 1611 at Howlets in Bekesborne, an estate which he had bought. Family He was twice married: first to Jane, daughter of Edward Isaac, and widow of Nicholas Sidley; secondly, to Dorothy, n√©e Scott, and widow of Thomas Hernden. By his first wife he had two sons, of whom the younger, Henry, succeeded his father as comptroller of the navy by a grant in reversion of 17 August 1611. Howlets was left to Palmer's stepson, Isaac Sidley, who made it over to his half-brother Henry.

It was significant for being one of the few Christian music albums to feature a synthpop sound. History Back cover of album. Left to right, Randy Rose, Roger Rose. Mike Pendleton is not pictured. In 1987 the band, consisting of Roger Rose, his brother Randy (who was only fifteen years old at the time) and their friend Mike Pendleton, released Mad at the World. The disc was unique in christian music for featuring a synthpop style of dance music heavily influenced by bands like Tears for Fears and especially Depeche Mode. This was at a time when the Christian music scene was dominated by Amy Grant and Stryper was breaking out. Roger's personal taste ran towards the sounds of Ultravox and Depeche Mode, a sound that no Christian band was playing at that time, prompting him to create the band and write the music. He attempted to \\"avoid church talk and cliche, (resulting) in some fresh, invigorating images.\\" Although not the best-selling album by the band,[] it is fondly remembered by many fans. Although Daniel Amos released Vox Humana in 1983, it featured a more up-beat sound, more guitar and more acoustic drums, so this disc stands as one of the first truly synthpop albums in Christian music. At 49 minutes and 13 seconds, this is the band's longest album. Although Roger has stated that Mad at the World was the band's first and last disc not recorded entirely at Roger's home studio, the drum tracks for Through the Forest were recorded at Randy's studio, Rose Studios. This album was reissued in 1999 by KMG Records on a \\"two-for-one\\" disc with Seasons of Love. Influence of Depeche Mode The heavy influence of Depeche Mode has been noted for this album. About this, Roger has responded, \\"I personally know plenty of people -- Christians -- who listen primarily to mainstream music because Christian music does not satisfy them musically. What Mad at the World is about is music that fills that kind of void, yet I feel it is lyrically uncompromising in its Christian message and values.\\" He has also said, \\"Depeche Mode is probably my favorite group musically, but lyrically they are the most offensive, so dark and terribly depressing.\\" His response was to write music answering the untruths which might affect young listeners, such as \\"Dry Your Tears\\" where he describes \\"a world where you see nothing everywhere\\" before singing \\"Close your eyes and pray/Heaven could be calling your name.\\" Track listing All songs written by Roger Rose. # \\"Living Dead\\" ‚Äì 3:28 # \\"All the Lonely Sheep\\" ‚Äì 5:50 # \\"I Want to See Heaven\\" ‚Äì 4:25 # \\"No Room Left\\" ‚Äì 4:05 # \\"Easy Way Out\\" ‚Äì 3:50 # \\"Bad Motives\\" ‚Äì 4:20 # \\"No More Innocence\\" ‚Äì 5:50 # \\"It Can't Rain Forever\\" ‚Äì 5:00 # \\"Here We Go Again\\" ‚Äì 3:28 # \\"Dry Your Tears\\" ‚Äì 4:10 # \\"Mad at the World\\" ‚Äì 3:55 # \\"Chance of Luck\\" ‚Äì 3:42 \\"No More Innocence\\" was re-recorded for the album Boomerang. \\"Mad at the World\\" was re- recorded for the album Through the Forest.

Other names were the Postgraduate School of Librarianship and Information Science (PGSLIS, 1967‚Äì81) and Department of Information Studies (1981-2011). , it employs 28 academic staff, 12 administrative/support staff, 7 affiliated research staff, and has about 50 research students. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath. The department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK. Since then, like many information science departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in cheminformatics, educational informatics, health informatics, information retrieval, information systems, knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the Journal of Information Science devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs. Research achievements The School is ranked second in the World and first in Europe for Library and Information Studies in the QS World University Rankings 2019. It was Number One in the World in 2018. The school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every Research Assessment Exercise since the running of the first exercise in 1986. In this UK-government sponsored assessment of research outputs, no other department in its subject field (or its University) achieved this consistency; few departments of any subject area in UK universities managed such a high level of continuous research output (see the following links to the 1992, 1996, 2001 RAE results). In 2008, rankings of departments was left to news organizations; the Times Higher Education placed Sheffield at No. 1 again. In 2008, an analysis of citations showed four of the ten most cited UK information studies academics were working in the Sheffield department. It is also the first UK-based (and 2nd European) department to be become an iSchool.

It holds that the divide between a statement of opinion and fact becomes more factual if one holds himself out as having expert knowledge. Facts Mr Mardon was buying a petrol station franchised by Esso Petroleum Co Ltd. Esso told him they had estimated that the throughput of a petrol station in Eastbank Street, Southport, would be 200,000 gallons a year; however, the local council had made a decision regarding planning permission which meant that there would be no direct access from the main street and therefore fewer customers. The estimate provided by Esso did not take this into account despite their knowledge of the decision. Mr Mardon bought the petrol station and business did not go well. From 1964, Mr Mardon negotiated a lower rent with Esso but was still losing money. Esso then brought an action for possession against Mr Mardon, who counterclaimed for damages of Esso's breach of warranty or negligence under Hedley Byrne. Lawson J held there was no contractual warranty and damages for negligent misstatement were limited to losses before 1964. Mr Mardon appealed. Judgment Lord Denning MR held there was a contractual warranty and damages were not limited. Lord Denning MR distinguished Bisset v Wilkinson because each party was 'equally able to form an opinion.' The damages awarded were for the loss suffered, not the loss of a bargain. He went on and said, if there had been no warranty (which there was) there would still be negligent misrepresentation liability in tort. It was argued that when a contract resulted, there was no tort liability, relying on Clark v Kirby-Smith,[1964] Ch 506 when Plowman J said a negligent solicitor was not liable in tort, only contract, based on Sir Wilfrid Greene MR in Groom v Crocker.[1939] 1 KB 194, 206 But these were old and the tort duty 'is comparable to the duty of reasonable care which is owed by a master to his servant, or vice versa'.Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd [1957] AC 555, 587 per Lord Radcliffe There is a duty to negotiate with care, Ormrod and Shaw LJJ concurred.

(born June 9, 1941) is an American global health researcher, public health physician, and internist. He is a Senior Lecturer in International Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Cash began his international career over 40 years ago when he was assigned by NIAID of the NIH to the Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory (CRL) in Dhaka, East Pakistan (now the ICDDR,B in Dhaka, Bangladesh). While there, he and his colleagues developed and conducted the first clinical trials of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in adult and pediatric cholera patients and patients with other infectious causes of diarrhea.Sandeep, K. \\"Worth his salt\\" in The Hindu, February 25, 2002 This technology matches the volume of fluid losses from dehydration patients with the volume they consume so that the fluid replacement packets greatly reduce or completely replace IV therapy (particularly where it is not feasible or unavailable), which was then the only current treatment for cholera. Discoveries in ORT have been estimated to have saved over 50 million lives worldwide.Oral rehydration therapy: the simple solution for saving lives  The BMJWoodward, Billy. \\"David Nalin-Over 50 Million Lives Saved.\\" Scientists Greater Than Einstein. Fresno: Quill Driver Books, 2009. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates are that at least 60 million children have been spared painful deaths because of ORT. They also conducted the first field trials of ORT, the first community-based trials of ORT, and the first use of amino acids (glycine) as an additional substrate. In the late 1970s, Cash worked with BRAC (presently the world's largest NGO in terms of programs and personnel) on their OTEP (Oral Therapy Extension Programme), which taught over 13 million mothers and caregivers how to prepare and use ORT in the home using the \\"pinch and scoop\\" method. It is estimated by WHO researchers that, each year, around 500 million packs of the oral rehydration solution are used in more than 60 developing countries,www.princemahidolaward.org saving over 60 million lives around the world. For demonstrating how inexpensive and simple- to-use oral rehydration therapy (ORT) could treat cholera and other diarrheal diseases, then by promoting in the developing world customized applications of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) developed by Cash and David R. Nalin (at Merck in Vaccine Development from 1983 to 2002), Cash, David Nalin, and Dilip Mahalanabis became joint recipients of the 2006 Prince Mahidol Award in public health for \\"exemplary contributions in the field of public health\\" and for their contributions \\"to the application of the oral rehydration solution in the treatment of severe diarrhea worldwide, including Thailand.http://www.ryt9.com/es/ryt9m/50430/ NOTE that the TEXT of the Mahidol Award ceremony of January 2007 notes that the Mahalanabis contribution is for the application of ORT. On November 8, 2011, Cash was presented with the 2011 James F. and Sarah T. Fries Foundation Prize for Improving Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for his leadership in the development and dissemination of Oral Rehydration Therapy as a practical treatment for cholera and other diarrheal diseases that has saved the lives of at least 60 million children worldwide.friesfoundation.org - This website is for sale! - friesfoundation Resources and Information  Contributions to ethics  Cash has lectured internationally and authored or co-authored a number of published papers on research ethics and teaches a Harvard course and had long directed (until 2009) a summer intensive workshop on those issues. He won continued NIH funding for a series of courses on research ethics in medical and health research done in resource-poor nations that touch on over a dozen issues listed on the public course's website. The use of case method teaching has been a critical element of all his courses. Many of the currently-used ethics case studies, the course outlines, many readings, and other course materials are available on that site. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Cash served (beginning in 2003) with the Russian Academy of Sciences project on development of bioethics capacity in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Contributions to public health Richard A. Cash explored contrasts within and between nations in health research ethics as a PI (Principal Investigator) of a training grant from the National Institutes of Health on \\"Ethical Issues in International Health Research\\" at HSPH. For eleven years, as Director of the Program on Ethical Issues in International Health Research and in line with his deep commitment to capacity building in growing nations, he has conducted training workshops based on this research in at HSPH, and in 18 nations in South America, Africa, India, and the Middle East, covering issues of informed consent, confidentiality, conflict of interest, investigator responsibilities to study populations, research in resource poor environments, and the development of ethical review committees. He has also overseen the training of 20 Fellows from Asia, and he has conducted over 30 workshops on research ethics in 12 nations.

In 2013, she created a collage of texts by Nelly Arcan and staged the piece, titled in French La Fureur de ce que je pense (The Fury of my Thoughts) at Espace Go in Montreal. The piece was later reprised at the FTA in Montreal and Carrefour in Quebec City and performed on tour in Madrid, Limoges and Amsterdam. In 2017, in company of her team, she staged the piece in its Japanese version. Created and originally performed in Tokyo, the play then toured through Japan in Kyoto, Hiroshima, Aichi, Toyohashi et Kitakyushu. Later in her career, Brassard began working as a dance dramaturge and director. She created two dance pieces in collaboration with dancer choreographer Sarah Williams: Moving in this World (2014), developed in residency in Potsdam, was presented in Montreal, Potsdam and in Madrid, and States of Transe (2013). Brassard also choreographed several short pieces in collaboration with a number of choreographers. In different contexts, she worked with Dana Gingras, Anne Th√©riault, Annik Hamel, Jane Mappin, Anne Plamondon and Karine Denault.

He invented a physics based method called vorticity confinement to compute the numerical solution of partial differential equations.  Biography  Steinhoff studied at University of Chicago where he was awarded a M.S. degree in physics. Later, in 1972, University of Chicago awarded him with a Ph.D. degree. Currently Steinhoff holds a faculty position in the department of aerospace engineering, University of Tennessee Space Institute. Most of his research has been involved the treatment of vortex-dominated flows in computational fluid dynamics and the treatment of short wave equation pulses, including the solution of real problems of engineering importance. The recent development of the vorticity confinement method that eliminates effects of numerical diffusion, for computations on Eulerian grids, without the use of Lagrangian markers. This technique has recently been used in many applications involving computation of: Helicopter Blade‚ÄîVortex Interaction, Delta Wing Flow, Helicopter Rotor/Body Flow, Helicopter Body‚ÄîVortex Interaction, Dynamic Stall, Aircraft Trailing Vortices, Supersonic Flow Over Missiles. Steinhoff also developed another computational technique, wave confinement, for propagating short wave equation pulses over long distances without the use of Lagrangian markers, which require the use of complex logic and are not feasible for intersecting pulses. This has major applications in communications, radar wave scattering, etc. His methods have also been used in creating special effects for movies such as Harry Potter and The Core. He also authored many scholarly articles and chapters on Vorticity Confinement. He was awarded the Arnold Research award for his major accomplishments in CFD field.

Writings He was a pupil of Moses ben Solomon ha-Kohen of Mainz, Eliezer ben Samuel of Metz and Judah ben Kalonymus; the judicial sentences of all he frequently cites. Baruch was one of the most eminent German rabbis of his time, and one of the leading signatories of the Takkanot Shum. Several of his responsa have been preserved in the German collections; most of them refer to the rabbinic civil law. His Sefer ha-·∏§okmah (Book of Wisdom), still extant in the time of Bezalel ben Abraham Ashkenazi, but now lost, appears also to have been largely legal in character. Early writers cite also a commentary by Baruch on the treatise Nedarim, which was lost at an early date. Of Baruch's poetical activity more is known. His penitential poems and dirges, as well as his hymns for the Sabbath and for weddings, which made him one of the most popular of the payye·π≠anim, were incorporated into the German and the Polish rituals. Baruch displays a great command of language; the seli·∏•ot, in particular, being frequently characterized by genuine poetic fervor. The following is a specimen of these poems, translated into English from a German version by Zunz: > \\"Jeshurun's God, beyond compare, Enthroned above the clouds, Who dwelleth in > the heavens high, Yet still on earth is ever nigh; Mid tears and sadness, > songs and gladness, To Him my gaze I turn, Who all my feeling, thought, and > action, Is ever sure to learn.\\" Children Rabbi Samuel ben Baruch of Bamberg studied under his father and Eliezer b. Samuel of Metz who also became a tosafist. Similar names Baruch, the subject of this article, should not be confounded with Baruch of Greece, a Tosafist quoted several times in the Tosafot and in Mordecai (compare List of Tosafists).

It holds that a statement of present intentions can count as an actionable misrepresentation and that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract so long as it is an influence. Facts Company directors sent shareholders a prospectus inviting subscriptions for debenture bonds. It said money would go to alter their buildings, buy horses, vans and expand into supplying fish. Really though, the purpose was to pay off liabilities, because the company was in trouble. Mistakenly believing he would get a first charge on company property, Mr Edgington bought bonds. He would have bought them anyway, had he known he would have no charge. Mr Edgington sought to recover money for deceit. Judgment The Court of Appeal upheld Denman J at first instance, saying that the directors were liable for deceit. Cotton LJ held that the statement of purpose was a fraudulent misrepresentation and Mr Edgington had relied on that despite his admission of mistake over charges. He said,(1885) 29 Ch D 459, 481 To fulfil the requirement that Mr Edgington relied on the statement, it is not necessary to show the misstatement was the sole cause of acting, so long as there was an influence. Bowen LJ said ‚Äòthe state of a man‚Äôs mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion... A misrepresentation as to the state of a man‚Äôs mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact... such misstatement was material if it was actively present to his mind when he decided to advance his money.‚Äô Fry LJ said the ‚Äòinquiry is whether this statement materially affected the conduct of the Plaintiff in advancing his money.‚Äô He pointed out the ‚Äòprospectus was intended to influence the mind of the reader.‚Äô See also *English contract law *Misrepresentation in English law Notes Category:English contract case law Category:United Kingdom company case law Category:English misrepresentation case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1885 in case law Category:1885 in British law ","title":"Edgington v Fitzmaurice"},{"id":"24596169","text":"Mashtayage Danushka Gunathilaka (born 17 March 1991), commonly as Danushka Gunathilaka is a professional Sri Lankan cricketer, who plays all formats of the game for Sri Lanka.

It holds that there is a duty to disclose material changes in circumstances that were represented to be true in negotiations. Facts Dr O‚ÄôFlanagan said truthfully in January 1934 that his medical practice had takings of ¬£2000 pa. However, in May the takings were only ¬£5 a week because O‚ÄôFlanagan had become ill. The contract was signed with Mr With to buy the medical practice, but Mr O'Flanagan did not disclose the change in circumstances. At trial the judge held that because the contract was not made uberrimae fidei. Where a statement is rendered false by a change in circumstances there is a duty to disclose the change. A failure to do so will result in an actionable misrepresentation Judgment Lord Wright MR held that Mr With could rescind either because there was a duty to point out the change in circumstance or because the representation continued till the point when the contract was signed. He referred to Fry J in Davies v London Provincial Marine InsuranceCo 8 Ch D 469 that there is no duty to disclose, even when someone believes facts to be operating on another‚Äôs mind. He noted fiduciary relationships can bring an entire duty of disclosure. Uberrimae fidei contracts, including partnership and marine insurance, do too. But also where in negotiations a statement is false and then the representor discovers it, though if he had said nothing he is entitled to hold his tongue throughout. He noted that a ‚Äòrepresentation made as a matter of inducement to enter a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.‚Äô Romer LJ stated, Clauson J concurred. Significance This affirms a general principle that any change to a fundamental reason for contracting (supervening falsification) must be communicated, where it is known to one party.

The unit existed from 1952 until the end of the Emergency in 1960.  Origins  The Malayan Emergency began during the aftermath of the Second World War. As the British tried to repair the Malayan economy, the Malayan Communist Party, or MCP, was organizing protests against labor conditions in the country.Michael Morgan,\\"The Rise and Fall of Malayan Trade Unionism, 1945-50\\", in Mohamed Amin and Malcolm Caldwell, ed's, Malaya, The Making of a Neo Colony (Nottingham, UK: Spokesman Books, 1977) p. 165. As the protests became more effective, the British responded with harsher measures. This in turn caused the protesters to become more militant, culminating in the beginning of organized violence with the assassination of three European plantation managers at Sungai Siput, Perak.Barbara Watson, Leonard Y. Andaya, A History of Malaysia (Hawaii: University of Hawaii Press, 2001). p. 271. An emergency was declared by the British government to deal with the insurgency. Eventually, to counter the insurgency, as part of the plan for dealing with the insurgency, the British implemented the Briggs Plan. In addition to cutting off the guerrillas from the population which supported them, the British made efforts to induce guerrillas to defect. After the assassination of the High Commissioner in 1952, Lieutenant General Sir Gerald Templer was sent out to head British operations in Malaya. As part of his new program, an emphasis was placed on intelligence and psychological warfare operations. In addition to working at getting better intelligence, as well as forming relations with the locals in the regions where the insurgency had its greatest support, under Templer's lead captured insurgents were wooed to the British side. These defectors would eventually be employed in the Special Operations Volunteer Force.Department of Defense,Office of Force Transformation, Network Centric Operations (NCO) Case Study. The British Approach to Low-Intensity Operations: Part II, (2007), p. 4. Formation Indigenous forces patrol fording a river while operating in the Malayan Jungle. SOVF forces typically operated in the remote regions populated by the ethnic Chinese where the MCP had most of its support during the Malayan Emergency. Under Templer's direction, psychological warfare was given special emphasis. As part of this strategy, surrendered or captured enemy guerrilla's, referred to as \\"surrendered enemy personnel\\" or SEPs and \\"captured enemy personnel\\" or CEPs, were treated as valuable resources. They were thoroughly debriefed, but always with an eye towards inducing continuing help rather than as a resource to be exhausted. The goal, through bribery or inducement, was to get the SEP/CEP to switch sides and fight on behalf of the government forces.Leon Comber, Malaya's Secret Police, 1945-1960: The Role of Special Branch in the Malayan Emergency, (Australia: Monash University Press, 2008) p. 4. The Special Operations Volunteer Force, or the SOVF, came into existence in 1952. The program, although a military one, was controlled by the Special Branch.Kumar Ramakrishna, Emergency propaganda: The Winning of Malayan Hearts and Minds, 1948-1958, (Richmond, Surrey: The Curzon Press, 2002) p. 142. It was formed from surrendered communist insurgents. The goal was to put the guerrilla's experience to work for the British. SEP/CEP volunteers to the SOVF committed to serving for 18 months. They were paid at the same rate as the junior police officers and were based in the same police compounds from which other government forces operated. SEP/CEP volunteers were formed into platoons and placed under the command of a British police officer. At the start of the program, there were approximately 180 SEP/CEP volunteers which were formed into twelve platoons, each with 15 former guerrillas and a British police officer. Typically, a SOVF platoon would operate near villages in the region where the disaffected ethnic Chinese, the portion of the population supporting the MCP, lived. In the field, the SOVF platoons operated according to the former guerrillas' experience. They would dress in clothing similar, carry weapons that the MCP guerrillas carried, and operated according to the same doctrine. However, the SOVF's mission was geared equally to inducing further defections. Although SOVF platoons could induce defections, they were also adept at eliminating MCP fighters, as well as spreading confusion among the MCP through so-called psyop and \\"black\\" tactics.  Life after the SOVF  After completing their tour with the SOVF, the former MCP guerrillas could return to Malayan society with a clean record. However, some SOVF members were deemed to be unsuited to be returned to civil society. For those in that situation, British and Malayan officials would send them to the Kemedore Agricultural Settlement. There, they would work the farms there until their rehabilitation was deemed complete.Ramakrishna, n. 299, p. 265. Impact As part of the larger policy implemented by Templer, the SOVF helped to undermine the MCP's propaganda. The success of the program helped to induce larger numbers of MCP guerrillas defect to the British-Malayan side, reestablishing government control in what had previously been MCP controlled areas.Pennell J. Hickey, Counterinsurgency Operations in Malaysia 1948-1960: The Role of Regular Forces, (1971) p. 39 The success of the SOVF, as well as the British success as a whole, became part of the counterinsurgency taught to U.S. officers as the Vietnam War intensified. The American military emulated the SOVF strategy, though not the other components which made it a success, in the Kit Carson Scouts program for communist defectors in Vietnam.

The duo made their debut in July 2009 at WWE's Night of Champions pay-per-view event, where Jericho replaced the legitimate injured Edge with Show as his tag team partner in his defense of the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (which was made by the unification of the World Tag Team Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship). Throughout the remainder of 2009, Jeri-Show were involved in several highly promoted feuds and angles, as well as defending the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship and challenging for the World Heavyweight Championship. The duo also headlined two of WWE's pay-per- view events during their short tenure together, with the first being at Survivor Series and the second at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs.  History = Unified WWE Tag Team Champions (2009‚Äì2010)  At The Bash on June 28, 2009, Jericho and his partner Edge, both heels, won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (which consisted of the World Tag Team Championship and the WWE Tag Team Championship) as surprise entrants in a tag team match. When Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon shortly thereafter which left him unable to wrestle, Jericho exploited a contractual loophole that allowed him to choose a new partner to replace Edge so that Jericho's reign could continue uninterrupted, while insulting Edge for being injury prone. On July 26 at Night of Champions, Jericho revealed fellow heel Big Show as his new tag team partner and they defeated Legacy members Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase to retain the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, thus allowing Show (who was from the Raw brand) and Jericho (who was from the SmackDown brand) to appear on both brands. Jeri-Show would then feud with Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard), which culminated in a successful title defense for Jeri-Show at SummerSlam on August 23. Jericho and Show would then feud with Montel Vontavious Porter and Mark Henry, which would also result in another successful title defense for Jeri-Show at Breaking Point on September 13 against them. Next, Jeri-Show would move on to feud with Batista, who then challenged for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship with Jericho's rival Rey Mysterio at Hell in a Cell on October 4, where resulted in another successful title defense. On the October 5 episode of Raw, Jeri-Show would begin a feud with Shawn Michaels and Triple H of D-Generation X (DX) following a loss in a non-title match. Leading up to Bragging Rights, Jericho was named as a co-captain (with Kane) for Team SmackDown while Show joined Team Raw, which was captained by DX. At Bragging Rights on October 25, Show turned on Team Raw when he attacked his teammates Kofi Kingston and Triple H, resulting in Jericho getting the win for Team SmackDown. Show would then reveal that his motives for aiding Team SmackDown was so that he would be granted a shot against SmackDown's World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker, while Jericho would insert himself into the title match as well after defeating Kane, thus making it a triple threat match. At Survivor Series on November 22, The Undertaker retained his World Heavyweight Championship after Jericho and Show turned on each other despite working together throughout most of the match. Jeri-Show would then continue their feud with DX and on December 13 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, they lost the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship to DX in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match, ending their reign at 140 days. On the December 14 episode of Raw, Jeri-Show won a Slammy Award for \\"Tag Team of the Year\\", while that same night they used their rematch clause against DX, who quickly intentionally disqualified themselves and retained Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (as a result, Jericho, from the SmackDown brand, could not appear on Raw as he was no longer a Unified WWE Tag Team Champion). DX granted Jeri-Show yet another rematch for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, with the additional stipulation that Jericho had to \\"leave Raw forever\\" if Jeri-Show lost, which they did on the January 4, 2010 episode of Raw, marking the end of Jeri-Show. After their breakup, Edge made his return at the 2010 Royal Rumble match to feud with Jericho, eliminating Jericho en route to winning the Rumble. Meanwhile, Show would go on to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship back from DX when he teamed with The Miz, forming ShoMiz. Jericho would eventually return to Raw again when he was drafted to the Raw brand through the 2010 WWE draft.  Unofficial reunions (2012‚Äì2016)  On the July 9, 2012 episode of Raw, Jeri-Show (as villains) reunited for one-time to take on John Cena and Kane in a tag team match, which they lost by disqualification. On the September 5, 2014 episode of SmackDown, Jeri-Show (as fan favorites) had a one-night reunion, competing in a ten-man tag team match that consisted of themselves teaming with John Cena, Mark Henry and Roman Reigns against Kane, Seth Rollins and The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan and Luke Harper), which Jeri-Show's team won by disqualification after The Wyatt Family broke up Cena's STF on Rollins and refused to stop their assault on Cena. On the January 28, 2016 episode of SmackDown, Show helped Jericho, Reigns and Dean Ambrose from a Wyatt Family assault, having a one night reunion for Jeri-Show.

A screw cap is a metal, normally aluminium, cap that screws onto threads on the neck of a wine bottle, generally with a metal skirt down the neck to resemble the traditional wine capsule (\\"foil\\"). A layer of plastic (often PVDC), cork, rubber, or other soft material is used as wad to make a seal with the mouth of the bottle. Its use as an alternative wine closure is gaining increasing support as an alternative to cork for sealing wine bottles. In markets such as Australia and New Zealand screw caps on bottles have overtaken cork to become the most common means of sealing bottles. Benefits and concerns Compared to cork, screw caps reduce the wine faults of oxidation and of cork taint, although it is possible to find TCA contamination in a screw cap bottle. Screw caps are generally perceived as easier to open and they are much easier to reseal. Screw caps have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation. However, cork has a centuries-old tradition behind it, and there are also concerns about the impact of screw caps on the aging of those few wines that require decades to be at their best. Some argue that the slow ingress of oxygen plays a vital role in aging a wine, while others argue that this amount is almost zero in a sound cork and that any admitted oxygen is harmful. Producers in Champagne have aged their wines under crown cap for quite some time; however, the crown cap is replaced by the traditional cork at the end of the second fermentation. The converse of oxidation is reduction, and it has been suggested that screwcapped wine leads to increased reduced characters if the underlying chemistry of the wine is reductive. These include a sulfide smell which in some circumstances adds a pleasant pungency to the wine, or may be distasteful. Stelvin screw caps The two parts of a Stelvin-brand screwcap The most known brand of wine screw caps is Stelvin. The caps have a long outside skirt, intended to resemble the traditional wine capsule (\\"foil\\"), and use plastic PVDC (Polyvinylidene chloride) as a neutral liner on the inside wadding. The Stelvin was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by a French company Le Bouchage M√©canique at the behest of Peter Wall, the then Production Director of the Australian Yalumba winery.http://203.23.76.110/yalumba/content.asp?p=214 In 1964 Peter Wall approached Le Bouchage M√©canique. The Stelvin cap was trialled in 1970 and 1971 with the Swiss wine Chasselas, which was particularly affected by cork taint, and was first used commercially in 1972 by the Swiss winery Hammel.Courtney, Sue (13 August 2001). \\"The History and Revival of Screwcaps\\". Wine of the Week. From about 1973 Yalumba and a group of other wineries - Hardys, McWilliams, Penfolds, Seppelt, Brown Bros and Tahbilk - were involved in developing and proving up the concept and began using it commercially in 1976. Le Bouchage M√©canique was later acquired by Pea-Pechiney, which became part of Alcan, then Rio Tinto Alcan and now Amcor. The brand was developed by Rio Tinto Alcan. It was trademarked in 1975. It was preceded as a closure by a Stelcap/cork combination (closed with cork, with a Stelcap on top): the Stelcap was also a long-skirted screw cap, but with a different inner lining (paper over cork, instead of PVDC or PVDC covered by foil-covered paper in a Stelvin). In 2005, a modified Stelvin cap, Stelvin Lux, was introduced. Like the standard Stelvin cap, the outer shell is aluminium, but there is no externally visible screw thread or knurling, giving the closure a cleaner look more like a traditional foil capsule. Internally, there is a pre-formed thread, and the sealing materials are the same as the standard Stelvin cap.Amcor Closure Systems Pty Ltd Adoption In the UK, acceptance by consumers more than doubled, from 41% in 2003 to 85% in 2011. Screw caps were widely adopted in the 1980s by Swiss winemakers, and have shown increasingly wide adoption in the succeeding years. Screw caps met with customer resistance in Australia and New Zealand, and were phased out in the early 1980s, only to be reintroduced gradually in the 1990s to capitalise on the emerging Chinese market. Since reintroduction, ever-increasing numbers of winemakers are using the screw cap within Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, adoption went from 1% in 2001 to 70% in 2004. Screw cap adoption in fine wines in Australia has proceeded in fits and starts. In July 2000, a group of Clare Valley Riesling producers, led by Jeffrey Grosset bottled a portion of their wines in screw cap, and earlier that year PlumpJack Winery announced it would bottle half its production of US$130 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon in screwcap. Other announcements have followed, including one from Bonny Doon Vineyard in July 2002 that 80,000 cases of its \\"Big House\\" red and white wine would be bottled under screwcaps - followed by almost all the rest of its production by late 2004 (200,000 cases total). Domaine Laroche in Chablis, France has been bottling its Chablis, Premier Cru and Grand Cru under screw caps since 2001 vintage. In July 2004 Corbett Canyon became the first US million plus case brand to switch to screw caps for its entire production, shipping just over three million cases a year. Some appellations ban the use of screw caps, including () Valpolicella Classico. In 2008, the ban led Italian producer Allegrini to withdraw from the Valpolicella Classico denomination in order to use a screw cap.

It belongs to the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism and was established in 1065 by Lama Duwang Chosje, under the command of the fifth king of Ladakh, Lhachen Gyalpo (Lha-chen-rgyal-po). Although Likir is relatively isolated, it was once on a major trade route which travelled via Tingmosgang, Hemis and Likir to Leh.Francke (1977), p. 91.

The inscription itself is dated to the reign of King Thse- dbang-rnam-rgyal II (Tsewang namgyal II, c. 1760-1780), who repaired the monastery after a conflagration.Francke (1977), p. 130.  Below the monastery was a large chorten with frescoes inside representing Tsongkapa and other lamas of his time. \\"Painted above the door, a very strange figure is found which looks much like one of the ordinary representations of Srong-btsan-sgam- po (Songts√§n Gampo). I was told by the lamas that it represents a lama of Srong-btsan-sgam-po's times. The figure wears a three-pointed hat of white colour and carries two leopard skins under his arms.\\" The lower part of the chorten is a square room which a lama said was the earliest temple at Likir, and was already there when King Lha-chenrgyal-po built the monastery. The monastery currently has approximately 120 Buddhist monks and a school with almost thirty students. The Central Institute of Buddhist Studies runs it and teaches in three languages, Hindi, Sanskrit and English. It also serves as the venue of an annual event Dosmochey, the assembly of votive offerings and sacred dances which takes place on the 27th day to 29th day of the 12th month of the Tibetan calendar. Dos-mo-che, the annual festival of the monastery, is held from the 27th to 29th of the 12th Tibetan month. It is the seat of the Ngari Rinpoche, the present emanation of the younger brother of the Dalai Lama. Although he does not permanently reside here, he attends the more important pujas.Rizvi (1996), pp. 242-242. Layout and interior Likir Monastery. 2010.jpgView of Likir Monastery, Ladakh, India.

The monastery has two assembly halls, known as Dukhangs and the older one is located on the right of the central courtyard with six rows of seats for the lamas and a throne for the Head Lama of Likir. The Dukhangs contain statues of Bodhisattva, Amitabha, three large statues of Sakyamuni, Maitreya and Tsong Khapa, founder of the yellow-hat sect. The verandah has thangka paintings of the Guardians of the Four Directions and wheel of life mandala held by Yama and the courtyard has a large Jupiter tree, a rare species. The Dukhang contains glass-fronted bookcases holding the Kandshur and the Thandshur and two rolled-up thangkas hang from the beams close to entrance containing pictures of Sakyamuni and Likir's guardian divinity. The monastery is also a repository of old manuscripts, has a notable thangka collection and old costumes and earthen pots. Sitting on the roof is a 23-metre (75 ft) high gilded gold statue of Maitreya (the future) Buddha. It was completed in 1999.Banerjee (2010), p. 131. The newer Dukhang, about 200 years old is located diagonally across from the courtyard's entrance and contains a statue of Avalokitesvara with 1000 arms and 11 heads. Bookcases stand at the statue sides, with the volumes of the Sumbum, describing the life and teachings of Tsong Khapa. The left wall has paintings of the 35 Confessional Buddhas while the right wall has an image of Sakyamuni with two of his chiefs by his side. A ladder leads out of the hall, followed by a doorway into the courtyard which in turn leads to the Zinchun, which is the head lama's room which contains mainly thangkas and images of lamas and the 21 manifestations of the White Tara, the consort of Avalokitesvara. Then there is the Gonkhang room which is dedicated to the guardian divinities which is accessed by descending the stairs outside the courtyard of the head lama's room. The Gonkhang was created in 1983 when the monastery underwent renovation and was completed a year later The walls of the Gonkhang contain thangkas of the divinities as does a glass-fronted room in front of the Gonkhang.

Merlin tells the stories of the origin and early life of Merlin, his role in the birth of Arthur, and how Arthur became the king of Britain. It emphasises Merlin's power to prophesy as well as his connection to the Holy Grail. Merlin introduced a number of new motifs that later became popular in medieval and later Arthuriana, also ensuring the lasting place of Merlin as a key character in the legend of King Arthur. The story of Merlin is related to Robert's two other reputed Grail poems. Its medieval prose retelling and its continuations, collectively known as the Prose Merlin, have been incorporated directly into the Vulgate and the Post-Vulgate cycles of chivalric romances during the early 13th century. Merlin and the Little Grail Cycle Writing Merlin, the French knight-poet Robert de Boron seems to have been influenced by Wace's Roman de Brut, an Anglo-Norman adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. It is an allegorical tale, relating to the figure and works of Christ. Only 504 lines of Merlin in its original poem form have survived to this day, but its contents are known from the prose version. Along with the poems attributed to Robert de Boron ‚Äì the romance , which survives only in prose, and Perceval, perhaps completely lost ‚Äì Merlin forms a trilogy centered around the story of the Holy Grail. This \\"Little Grail Cycle\\" makes the role and part of Merlin in the Arthurian legend much greater, especially as compared with its one minor appearance in all five Arthurian works by Chr√©tien de Troyes.) For it tells the story of the Arthurian myth as completely rewritten for the Holy Grail. The Grail, brought from the Middle East to Britain by followers of Joseph of Arimathea, is eventually recovered by Arthur's knight Percival, as foretold in one of the prophecies in Merlin. An alternative theory postulated by Linda Gowans goes against the widely accepted conventional scholarship in deeming the prose text to be the original version of Merlin. She argues that the poem is unfinished because its unknown writer has simply given up on it. She also doubts Robert's authorship of either of these works or of Perceval, attributing only Joseph to him. Synopsis :Note: All names and events as in the later Middle English anonymous prose version. The first part introduces the character of , a cleric and clerk who is pictured as writing down Merlin's deeds, explaining how they came to be known and preserved. The text claims that it is actually only his translation of a Latin book written by a Blaise as dictated to him by Merlin himself. Merlin begins with the scene of a council of demons plotting to create the future Merlin as their agent on Earth to undo the work of Christ, but their plan is foiled and the mother names the child Merlin after her father. It continues with the story of the usurper king Vortiger (Vortigern) and his tower, featuring the seven-year-old Merlin with amazing prophetic powers. Following Vortiger's death, which Merlin also predicted, he assists the new king Pendragon and his brother Uter (Uther Pendragon, soon himself the king as Uterpendragon after the death of the original Pendragon at Salisbury) in their bloody war against Saxon invaders, later erecting Stonehenge as burial place for the fallen Britons and eventually inspiring the creation of the Round Table. This is followed by the account of Uter's war with the Duke of Tintagel (here unnamed, but known as Gorlois in general Arthurian tradition) for the latter's wife Ygerne (Igraine), during which Merlin's magic, including many instances of shapeshifting, enables Uter to sleep with Ygerne and conceive Arthur, destined to become the Emperor of Rome. After Uter kills his rival and forcibly marries Ygerne, the newborn Arthur is given into the foster care of Antor (Ector), while Ygerne's daughters from the previous marriage are wed to King Lot and King Ventres (Nentres), and her illegitimate daughter Morgan is sent away to a nunnery and becomes known as Morgan le Fay (the first account of Morgan being Igraine's daughter and learning magic in a conventCarolyne Larrington, King Arthur's Enchantresses, p. 41.). The poem seems to have ended with the later \\"sword in the stone\\" story, in which Arthur proves he is to become Britain's high king by a divine destiny. This has been the first instance of this motif to appear in Arthurian literature; it has become iconic after being repeated almost exact in Thomas Malory's popular Le Morte d'Arthur. The following is the complete text of the mid-15th-century English translation (medieval English versions replaced the Anglo-Saxon enemies of Britain with the Saracens, the Danes, or just unidentified heathens), with modern conventions for punctuation and capitalization, of the prose version (sans the sequels): #The Birth of Merlin #Vortiger's Tower #Vortiger's Demise; The Battle of Salisbury; and The Death of Pendragon #Uther and Ygerne #Arthur and the Sword in the Stone Prose and continuations Merlin is regarded as having been followed by the third part in Robert's Grail cycle, Perceval, however this poem is either entirely lost or perhaps was never even really written. It is nevertheless uncertainly associated with the anonymous romance known as the (Perceval en prose), which might be either a reworked prose 'translation' of Robert's poem or just another author's unofficial attempt to complete the trilogy, and was found in only two of the many surviving manuscripts of prose rendition of Merlin. The poem Merlin itself was recast into prose c. 1210 as the Prose Merlin by authors unknown (highly possibly a single author, perhaps Robert himself). It was then (as Merlin Proper) extended with a lengthy sequel sometimes known as the Suite du Roman de Merlin to become the early 13th-century romance Estoire de Merlin (History of Merlin), also known as the Vulgate Merlin. The Estoire de Merlin constitutes one of the volumes of the vast Vulgate Cycle (Lancelot-Grail) as probably late addition to it. The later Post-Vulgate Cycle also begins with material drawn directly from Joseph and Merlin. The writer of the Post-Vulgate manuscript known as the Huth Merlin in fact attributed the authorship of the entire Post- Vulgate Cycle to Robert. The first of these prose sequels to Merlin, included in the Vulgate Estoire du Merlin, is the Merlin Continuation also known as Vulgate Suite du Merlin, a 'historical' sequel about the various wars of Arthur and the role of Merlin in them, also focusing on Gawain as the third main character. The second, included in the Post-Vulgate Suite du Merlin (Suite-Huth or the Huth Merlin), is a 'romantic' sequel that includes elements of the Vulgate Lancelot. The third is an alternative version known as the Livre d'Artus (Book of Arthur), which too was written after the Vulgate Cycle had been completed. Today, the Post-Vulgate Suite is best known as the primary source of Malory for the first four books of Le Morte d'Arthur. It also served as the basis for the Merlin sections of Castilian Demanda del Sancto Grial and Galician-Portuguese Demanda do Santa Graal. Prior English translations and adaptations have included Henry Lovelich's verse Merlin and the romance Of Arthour and Merlin, each based on different manuscripts of the Vulgate Merlin.

In 1995, Evenflo Company, Inc. was created through the merger of Evenflo Juvenile Products and Evenflo Juvenile Furniture Company (formerly known as Questor Juvenile Furniture Company). The company was acquired by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., together with Spalding in 1996 and again in 1997 by Gerry Baby Products Company, a division of Huffy Corporation. In 2004, Harvest Partners another private equity firm, acquired the company. Harvest sold Evenflo to Weston Presidio in 2007.

Although she had appeared on albums before, it had been in the context of either a musical theater or multiple artist recording. The album also marked the return of Ellington to Columbia after an absence of four years, and was one of the first examples of overdubbing being used as an integral part of the creation, rather than for effects or to correct mistakes.  Background and content  During the early 1950s, it had been the policy of both company president Goddard Lieberson and producer Mitch Miller at Columbia to discourage their roster of popular singers from planning full albums, the LP reserved for serious work such as classical music or original cast recordings.Will Friedwald. Blue Rose. 1999 reissue, Columbia/Legacy CK 65506, liner notes. This policy changed with the success of popular music albums on other labels, and to give the return of Ellington to the fold exposure beyond the jazz audience, producer Irving Townsend decided on pairing the Ellington band with a singer for a full album, choosing Clooney for her sultry voice and her spate of hit records throughout the decade.Friedwald, Blue Rose reissue liner notes. The project encountered difficulty from Clooney being both on the outs with her usual producer Mitch Miller and pregnant in Los Angeles, with the Ellington Orchestra being recorded in New York.Gary Mamorstein. The Label: The Story of Columbia Records. New York\\": Thunder's Mouth Press, 2007. p. 195. With Townsend at the helm, Clooney agreed to the project, and long-time Ellington orchestrator and musical foil Billy Strayhorn was dispatched to guide Clooney through the arrangements and recording in L.A. Recordings of the Ellington Orchestra took place on January 23 and 27, 1956, at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York, and Clooney's vocals were recorded for overdubbing to the New York track on February 8 and 11 in Los Angeles.Friedwald, Blue Rose reissue liner notes. The material selected originated from the Ellington songbook, and all songs were arranged by Strayhorn. The title tune was specifically written by Ellington for the album and Clooney. On June 15, 1999, Legacy Records reissued the album remastered for compact disc. Two bonus tracks were added from the sessions that were not included on the original LP, released as Columbia single 55591 \\"If You Were in My Place (What Would You Do?)\\" and its b-side \\"Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'.\\".

She was the daughter of Charles VIII of Sweden and his first queen consort, Catherine of Bjurum. In 1468‚Äì1470, her spouse Ivar Axelsson (Tott) was the promised successor of her father as regent. Biography Magdalena was one of Charles's nine children, most of whom died in infancy. Her father became King of Sweden in 1448. She married Ivar Axelsson (Tott) in Nyk√∂ping on 21 September 1466. Their marriage was childless. Her spouse was the uncle of Ingeborg Tott, the spouse of regent Sten Sture the Elder. Her spouse was a former royal councillor in Denmark, having lived in Sweden since 1464, and after his marriage to Magdalena was made royal councillor of Sweden. In 1468, he was made more or less an informal co-regent and was promised to succeed his father-in-law after his death as interim regent, presiding over the council until the election of a new regent or monarch, and he was once described as \\"The most powerful man in Scandinavia\\". Upon the death of his father-in-law in 1470, however, he was not given enough support to become regent for Charles's young son, Magdalena's half-brother who soon was outmaneuvered anyway by Lord Sture. By 1472, it was clear that Magdalen's one- reign Bonde Dynasty would not survive on the throne, and her husband was given Stegeborg as a fief. Ivar Axelsson betrayed Sweden, admitting in 1476 that he was promised Gotland as a fief by the Danish King, and in 1481, an open conflict occurred between Ivar and Swedish Regent. Ivar was deemed as a traitor to Sweden, upon which Princess Magdalena, by order of Erik Oxenstierna at the council of Vadstena, was abducted and imprisoned. Magdalen became a widow in 1487. Magdalena was the benefactor of the Grey Friar's Abbey on Riddarholmen in Stockholm, to which she made many large donations, by which she was honoured by the monks with the inscription Propentissima Benefactrix Ordinis Nostri. She died in S√∂derk√∂ping and was buried in the Grey Friar's Abbey there, of which few visible ruins remain.

The river divides the Grande-√éle and the Island of Salaberry, which are located approximately 50 km east of Montreal. The river is 8 km long, and drops 24m over its course from Lake Saint Francis east to Lake Saint-Louis. __TOC__  Geography  The Saint Charles River is not a distinct river unto itself, it is in reality an arm of the Saint Lawrence River. The river originates at the end of Lake Saint Francis at Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and passes through the town of Saint- Timoth√©e, before entering Lake Saint Louis to the east. Originally, at the eastern end of Lake Saint Francis, there were two channels, northern channel and the Saint Charles River. Because of the presence of rapids, several canals have been built. The Old Beauharnois Canal and the Soulanges Canal, neither of which are still in use, and the Beauharnois Canal have contributed to changes in flow of the rivi√®re Saint-Charles. Historically, it has been a significant source of hydroelectric power for factories in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. Much of the river's banks are developed, but a portion of its banks remain undeveloped. Rivi√®re Saint-Charles looking south from the Public Works in Valleyfield, autumn, 2009 The Saint Charles River is in the physiographic region of the Saint Lawrence Lowlands. The bedrock of the region is a slightly dipping limestone, but glacial deposits define the landscape. Deep, arable soils lie across this flat plain, which rarely exceeds 200m above sea level. Before extensive logging and development, the Saint Lawrence Lowlands were a mix of mostly forest and wetlands. However, they now remain primarily as isolated fragments. The region between Lake Saint Francis and Lake Saint Louis originally supported a diverse fluvial environment which has now been transformed into a slow-moving lacustrine one. The Saint Charles River is one area that has not been significantly dammed but still has seen a large degradation of habitat.Jourdain (1998). Rapport Technique: Synth√®se des connaissances sur les aspets socio-√©conomiques du secteur d'√©tude Valleyfield- Beauharnois The Saint Lawrence Lowlands is also the most urbanized ecozone in Canada, holding most of Canada's population and manufacturing jobs. The Saint Charles River has developed considerably in terms of agriculture and industry. A sizable portion of the river is residentially owned, which is typical of many rivers in the region. Only 15% of the natural shoreline in the area remains today.Jourdain (1998). Rapport Technique: Synth√®se des connaissances sur les aspets socio-√©conomiques du secteur d'√©tude Valleyfield-Beauharnois The municipal government of Valleyfield recently purchased a portion of the river, and has halted development on it for the time being.  Fish migration  Because of extensive damming of the Saint Lawrence, several fish species are left without sufficient areas to migrate up and downstream. Many fish species are able to migrate easily downstream through the Beauharnois Dam. However, several species, such as the eel and lake sturgeon, are not able to survive the turbines of the dam. Because it has only one small dam at its mouth, it is an important spot for up and downstream fish migration. A fish ladder was put in place to allow for more ease of migration. Data has shown that the pass has worked for some species, such as the cyprinidae.  History  Before industrial development, the river and surrounding areas were used mostly as agricultural land by the Iroquois and European colonists. In the mid 19th century, the river was recognised for its hydroelectric potential and factories began to be built in the region. The old Beauharnois Canal was created in 1849 and its power was harnessed by a saw mill, Valleyfield Mills, which was Canada's largest supplier of paper for newspapers at the time. Thus, because of its hydroelectric potential, there is a long history of factory placement along the Saint Charles River and the old Beauharnois Canal. During the period of heavy industrialization along its banks, the health of the river was largely neglected. After the creation of the first Beauharnois Canal in 1849, the river was dammed at its mouth to regulate its flow. Until the 1970s the flow of the river was kept very low as to allow the maximum flow possible through the other canals. However, an accumulation of waste in the river from factories along its banks began to pollute the river. For example, the factory Expro Inc., which produced (and still produces) chemical products such as nitroglycerine, has been accused of dumping toxic waste into the river. Long after continuous dumping had started, an agreement was reached between Hydro Quebec and the City of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield to increase the flow of the river to 30m3/s to dilute the unpleasant odours from the river. Since the 1970s, the flow of water in the river has been kept constant at 30m3/s, but there has been little effort to clean the river. Several studies have shown that the water quality of the river is low, and much lower, in fact, than that of the Saint Lawrence in general.Morin, Jean and Leclerc, Michel (2003). From pristine to present stat: hydrological evolution of Lac Saint Fran√ßois. The cumulative effects of industrialization near the river and of dumping wastes have given the river a negative view in the community, and it is sometimes referred to as the \\"rivi√®re des √©tangs\\" which, roughly translated, means the river of feces.  Recreation  Salaberry-de-Valleyfield is a popular destination for boaters of all sorts. Sailing and motorized boating is popular on Lake Saint Francis, and there is a world class whitewater kayak course on the rivi√®re Saint-Charles. It is located at the head of the river just as it exits Saint Francis Bay. The site was completely redesigned in 2002 for kayak paddling, and has 300m of Class I through Class III paddling. The site is especially suited for racing because the water level is controlled at the intake and is more or less constant. The 2004 Canadian Slalom Championships and the 2009 North American Under-23 Paddling Championships were held there.

It holds that a contract can be rescinded for innocent misrepresentation, even where the representee also had the chance to verify the false statement. Facts Mr Redgrave, an elderly solicitor, advertised for a partner to join the business and buy the accompanying house. He said in an interview with Mr Hurd that the practice brought in ¬£300 pa, when it was only ¬£200 pa. Mr Redgrave showed him summaries that came to a ¬£200 pa average income and said that the rest of the ¬£300 figure was borne out by other papers in the office that he could check (in fact they showed no business). Mr Hurd did not inspect the papers, until he realised the truth just before completion of the agreement. He had signed the contract but he refused to go through. Mr Redgrave sued for specific performance and Mr Hurd counterclaimed for rescission based on fraudulent misrepresentation. Fry J held that because Mr Hurd had not taken the opportunity to check through the papers, he could not be taken to have relied on them. Mr Hurd appealed. Judgment Sir George Jessel MR held that Mr Hurd‚Äôs counterclaim for fraudulent misrepresentation failed because there was no plea that Mr Redgrave knew his statements were untrue. Therefore, there was no entitlement to damages. Nevertheless, Fry J‚Äôs decision was reversed, and the contract was rescinded on grounds of innocent misrepresentation. He held that relying on the representation was enough and there was no duty to inspect the papers. For rescission, he noted the difference of law (knowledge was necessary) and equity, where the approach was ‚ÄòA man is not to be allowed to say‚Ä¶ that when he made it he did not know it to be false; he ought to have found that out before he made it‚Äô and ‚Äòno man ought to seek to take advantage of his own false statements‚Äô. If a man is induced to enter a contract by a false representation it is not a sufficient answer to him to say, ‚ÄòIf you had used due diligence you would have found out that the statement was untrue. You had the means afforded you of discovering its falsity, and did not choose to avail yourself of them... If it is a material representation calculated to induce him to enter into the contract, it is an inference of law that he was induced by the representation to enter into it‚Äô and so it is for the person alleging otherwise to show it.

The question remained, however, if and how the \\"plane\\" pressing is recognized. This principle was used by Hans Goldmann (1899‚Äì1991) who referred to it as the Imbert-Fick \\"law\\", thus giving his newly marketed tonometer (with the help of the Haag-Streit Company) a quasi-scientific basis; it is mentioned in the ophthalmic and optometric literature, but not in any books of physics. According to Goldmann,Goldmann H. \\"Applanation Tonometry\\". Transactions Second Glaucoma Conference. New York, Josiah Macy, Jr Foundation. 1957. \\"The law states that the pressure in a sphere filled with liquid and surrounded by an infinitely thin membrane is measured by the counterpressure which just flattens the membrane.\\" \\"The law presupposes that the membrane is without thickness and without rigidity...practically without any extensibility.\\" The problem is that a sphere formed by such a membrane and filled with incompressible liquid (water) cannot be indented or applanated even when the pressure inside is zero, because a sphere contains the maximum volume with the minimum surface area.Koster W. \\"Beitr√§ge zur Tonometrie und Manometrie des Auges\\". Graefe's Arch. Ophthalmol. 1895; 41: 113-158.Markiewitz HH. \\"The so- called Imbert-Fick Law\\". AMA Arch. Ophthalmol. 1960; 64: 189/159. Any deformation necessarily increases surface area, which is impossible if the membrane is inelastic, such as aluminum foil. The actual physical basis of tonometry is Newton's third law of motion: \\"If you press a stone eyeball with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone eyeball.\\" The law is this: :Intraocular pressure = Contact force/Area of contact The law assumes that the cornea is infinitely thin, perfectly elastic, and perfectly flexible.Whitacre, MM, Stein, R. (1993) \\"Sources of error with use of Goldmann-type tonometers\\". Surv. Ophthalmol. 38,1-30 None of these assumptions are true. The cornea is a membrane that has thickness and offers resistance when pressed.Anders Eklund, Per Hallberg, Christina Lind√©n, and Olof A. Lindahl. (2003) \\"An Applanation Resonator Sensor for Measuring Intraocular Pressure Using Combined Continuous Force and Area Measurement\\". Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003 Jul;44(7):3017-24. Therefore, in Goldmann tonometry, readings are normally taken when an area of 3.06mm diameter has been flattened. At this point the opposing forces of corneal rigidity and the tear film are roughly approximate in a normal cornea and cancel each other out allowing the pressure in the eye to be inferred from the force applied.The Glaucoma Book, Paul N.

Visiting the restaurant is a tradition for many New England families on birthdays and anniversaries. It is also considered a top destination for fans of tiki culture and has been a stop on organized tours. After three generations of ownership by the same family the restaurant has grown several times and a large range of Cantonese, Szechuan, Japanese, Polynesian, and Thai cuisines are served in several themed dining rooms and lounges. Kowloon was called one of the very best Chinese restaurants in New England by Boston television station WHDH in 2004. History Kowloon Restaurant, 2008The Mandarin House restaurant opened August 22, 1950, in a converted ice cream parlor on the Newburyport Turnpike with a menu of a few dozen Chinese and American dishes. The dining room could hold 40-50 customers. In 1958 Madeline and Bobby Kowloon bought out the first generation owners and began the second generation of family ownership of the restaurant. They changed the name to Kowloon Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge and began to grow the business. In the next 50 years the family added five additions to the original building and increased the capacity to accommodate 1,200 customers. Diners can choose from a number of themed dining rooms including the Volcano Bay Room, the Tiki Lagoon, the Mandarin Room, the Thai Grille, or the Hong Kong Lounge. Private events and a comedy club use the Luau Room. The menu has grown as the restaurant has added new dishes to keep up with the evolving American palate. First Polynesian dishes, then Chinese when Joyce Chen became popular, more Chinese when Nixon went to China, even more Chinese when Szechuan became popular, then Thai, and then Japanese and sushi. Guests now choose from a menu of nearly 300 items. In 2001 Madeline and Bobby Kowloon were inducted into the Hospitality Hall of Fame by the Massachusetts Restaurant Association. The restaurant has also been nominated for addition to the Inventory of Cultural and Historical Resources by the Saugus Historical Commission. Bill Wong died in 2011 at the age of 88. Visitors will always find a family member at the restaurant as the third generation of the Wong family continues to run this independent business. The restaurant is reported to bring in over $8 million per year as the top-grossing Chinese restaurant in the United States. The current owner is State Representative Donald Wong.

The story is a fairy tale about the daughter of Sleeping Beauty, named Alinda. The result of a collaboration between a British primary school teacher and an American college professor, the novel was published by Across the Pond Publishing in 2009. Plot summary Alinda experiences a similar curse to the one cast on her mother; However, in this tale, the Shadow Fairy curses Alinda with a 500-year deep sleep. On her eighteenth birthday, Alinda falls asleep, and knowing that they will not be around when she is awakened, the King and Queen find a secure resting place for her and employ a young dragon named Nessie to keep watch of her for those five hundred years. The story takes an unsuspecting turn when Alinda wakes up staring out of her glass topped bed to a young man named Grant. From this point, Alinda is introduced to an unfamiliar modern world with airplanes, cars, rock music and very different clothing styles. Setting Alinda of the Loch is set in Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, and the young dragon employed by Queen Aurora and King Colin to safeguard their young daughter is suspected to be the Loch Ness monster. Alinda of the Loch offers a unique approach to the story of Sleeping Beauty and the legend of the Loch Ness Monster.  References  *Brown, Julie Ann; Oonagh, Jane Pope. Alinda of the Loch.

The mill has two functions; a corn mill and an oil mill. It was built in 1852 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 32541. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History Woldzigt was built in 1852 for S J Datema and E F Aukema. It was built as a corn mill and oil mill combined. The oil mill was used to crush linseed to produce linseed oil and rapeseed to produce rapeseed oil. The season for oil milling ran from September until May. Throughout the year the mill also functioned as a corn mill. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 1902, the mill was sold to Jan Rietema of Leens. A Deutz petrol engine was installed in that year as auxiliary power. In 1906, the petrol engine was replaced by a steam engine. Rietema worked the mill until 1919 when he left to take the oil mill Tjamsweer at Appingedam, Groningen. The steam engine was removed at that date. The mill was then sold to the co√∂peratieve olieslagerij en korenmalerij Woldzigt G.A. It was worked by Jan Faber who had been employed at the mill since 1912. During this time the mill was used to produce cattle food and artificial fertiliser. In 1941, the mill ceased to produce oil. The mill was sold to the Co√∂peratieve Zuivelfabriek Roden-Zevenhuizen in 1945. Jan Faber died in 1946. The mill was then worked by Frederick van der Velde, who had been employed at the mill since 1925. The mill was producing of flour per day. Corn milling ended in 1951. In 1970, the mill was sold to the Gemeente Roden. The Stichting olie- en korenmolen Woldzigt (English: Oil and corn mill Woldzigt Society) was formed. The mill was completerly restored in 1976. Description Woldzigt is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante stellingmolen\\". It is a three-storey smock mill on a four-storey brick base. The stage is at third-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails, which have a span of , are carried in a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Koning in 1904. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 72 cogs. The brake wheel drives the wallower (48 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft the great spur wheel, which has 103 cogs, drives the diameter French Burr millstones via a lantern pinion stone nut which has 24 staves. The diameter edge runner stones and the stamp mills are driven by lantern pinion stone nuts of 26 and 27 staves.

They are often bright orange in color, with fine- grained, yellow-orange flesh. The skin, deeply ribbed and slightly roughened, can grow to be thick, making them favorable for storage. The flesh has been described as good for canning and freezing. However, their size often makes utilizing them for culinary uses cumbersome, and they lack the flavor and texture present in smaller pumpkin varieties. The variety was hybridized for its size during the early 1960s. Specimens as large as 300 pounds have been grown. Individual fruits are round to slightly flattened. Best planted between two and four weeks after the average last frost, Big Max pumpkins typically become ripe 110 to 120 days after sowing. The cultivar requires large amounts of room to grow properly, and to achieve the maximum size, it is recommended to limit each vine to one fruit. They are harvested before the first light frost, when the plant's foliage dies. Seedlings sometimes emerge in five to ten days, though germination may take up to 14 days. Although recommendations vary, seeds are often planted at a depth of , spaced apart, in hills of between five and eight seeds. Hills are spaced apart, and thinned to two to three plants.

The cricket pavilion at the park dates from 1882. A multitude of sports have been played at the park, including cricket. The ground is owned by the local council. It is currently used by Weston-super- Mare Cricket Club. Layout The park is laid out in two sections. The western section is considerably the larger and is separated from the eastern section by Walliscote Road. The eastern section is a large trapezoidal area of flat open lawn, with an encircling pathway; outside the pathway, there is a wide band of less manicured land heavily populated with mature trees. The lawned area (pictured) is often used to host cricket matches. The cricket pavilion is at the western edge, backing onto Walliscote Road. Part of the southern edge of the lawn is marked out for use as a croquet pitch; croquet matches are frequently held during the summer months. During recent years, this eastern section of Clarence Park has been used as a drop-off and pickup zone for the T4 on the Beach music event. The western section of the park is laid out as a more formal park with mature trees, flower beds, lawned areas, and a fish pond with fountain. Part of the southern end of this section is taken up by the clubhouse and 3 greens of the Clarence Bowling Club. At the north end, near Walliscote Road, there is a house originally used as the park- keeper's lodge. There is a children's play area near the western edge. Approximately in the centre of the western section of the park, there is a small pavilion, operated in recent years as a cafe. The future of the cafe is currently under threat as a result of an arson attack which took place in early September 2011. Cricket The park played host to home matches for Somerset between 1914 and 1996. The ground had a capacity of 6,000 spectators. The first recorded match on the ground which involved a senior cricket team was on 21 August 1914 and saw a Weston-super-Mare team play Glamorgan, seven years before Glamorgan were awarded first-class status. Several days later Somerset played their first match on the ground against Yorkshire. The highest attendance at the ground was 6,000 during a match against Hampshire in the 1947 County Championship season. In 1936, there was talk about moving the Weston festival away from Clarence Park, a move strongly resisted by Jack White, who thought the ground to be \\"lovely\\". The festival remained at the ground for another sixty years, until the August 1996 Cricket Festival when Somerset played their final first-class or List A match at Clarence Park. Their final opponent on the ground was Durham.

Application of thermomechanical processing in rebar steel The quenching process produces a high strength bar from inexpensive low carbon steel. The process quenches the surface layer of the bar, which pressurizes and deforms the crystal structure of intermediate layers, and simultaneously begins to temper the quenched layers using the heat from the bar's core. Steel billets 130mm¬≤ (\\"pencil ingots\\") are heated to approximately 1200¬∞C to 1250¬∞C in a reheat furnace. Then, they are progressively rolled to reduce the billets to the final size and shape of reinforcing bar. After the last rolling stand, the billet moves through a quench box. The quenching converts the billet's surface layer to martensite, and causes it to shrink. The shrinkage pressurizes the core, helping to form the correct crystal structures. The core remains hot, and austenitic. A microprocessor controls the water flow to the quench box, to manage the temperature difference through the cross-section of the bars. The correct temperature difference assures that all processes occur, and bars have the necessary mechanical properties. The bar leaves the quench box with a temperature gradient through its cross section. As the bar cools, heat flows from the bar's centre to its surface so that the bar's heat and pressure correctly tempers an intermediate ring of martensite and bainite. Finally, the slow cooling after quenching automatically tempers the austenitic core to ferrite and pearlite on the cooling bed. These bars therefore exhibit a variation in microstructure in their cross section, having strong, tough, tempered martensite in the surface layer of the bar, an intermediate layer of martensite and bainite, and a refined, tough and ductile ferrite and pearlite core. When the cut ends of TMT bars are etched in Nital (a mixture of nitric acid and methanol), three distinct rings appear: 1. A tempered outer ring of martensite, 2. A semi-tempered middle ring of martensite and bainite, and 3. a mild circular core of bainite, ferrite and pearlite. This is the desired micro structure for quality construction rebar. In contrast, lower grades of rebar are twisted when cold, work hardening them to increase their strength. However, after thermo mechanical treatment (TMT), bars do not need more work hardening. As there is no twisting during TMT, no torsional stress occurs, and so torsional stress cannot form surface defects in TMT bars. Therefore TMT bars resist corrosion better than cold, twisted and deformed (CTD) bars. After Thermomechanical processing, some grades in which TMT Bars can be covered includes Fe: 415 /500 /550/ 600. These are much stronger compared with conventional CTD Bars and give up to 20% more strength to concrete structure with same quantity of steel.

Such maps help to identify earthquake epicenters, particularly where no instrumental records exist, such as for historical earthquakes. They also contain important information on ground conditions at particular locations, the underlying geology, radiation pattern of the seismic waves, and the response of different types of buildings. They form an important part of the macroseismic approach, i.e. that part of seismology dealing with noninstrumental data. The shape and size of the isoseismal regions can be used to help determine the magnitude, focal depth, and focal mechanism of an earthquake. History The first known isoseismal map was produced for the 1810 earthquake in M√≥r in Hungary, and published by Kitaibel and Tomts√°nyi in 1814. The first, six-level intensity scale was proposed by Egen in 1828 for an earthquake in Rhineland. Robert Mallet coined the term \\"isoseismal\\" and produced a map for the 1857 Basilicata earthquake with a three-fold intensity scale and used this and other information to identify the epicentral area (a term he also coined). Later studies made use of similar techniques, the main changes being to the actual seismic intensity scale employed. Methodology Firstly, observations of the felt intensity need to be obtained for all areas affected by the tremor. In the case of recent earthquakes, news reports are augmented by sending out questionnaires or by collecting information online about the intensity of the shaking. For a historical earthquake, the procedure is much the same, except that it requires searching through contemporary accounts in newspapers, letters, diaries, etc. Once the information has been assembled and intensities assigned at the location of the individual observations, these are plotted on a map. Isoseismal lines are then drawn to link together areas of equal shaking. Because of local variations in the ground conditions, isoseismals generally separate zones of broadly similar felt intensity, while containing areas of both higher and lower degrees of shaking.How to map an earthquake, by Roger Musson, BGS To make the isoseismals less subjective, attempts have been made to use computer-based methods of contouring such as kriging, rather than relying on visual interpolation.Linkimer, L. 2008. Application of the kriging method to draw isoseismal maps of the significant 2002‚Äì2003 Costa Rican earthquakes. Revista Geol√≥gica de Am√©rica Central, 38, 119‚Äì134. Use=Locating the epicenter In most earthquakes, the isoseismals define a single clear area of maximum intensity, which is known as the epicentral area. In some earthquakes, more than one maximum exists because of the effect of ground conditions or complexities in the rupture propagation, and other information is, therefore, required to identify the area that contains the epicenter. Measuring the magnitude The magnitude of an earthquakes can be roughly estimated by measuring the area affected by intensity level III or above in km2 and taking the logarithm. A more accurate estimate relies on the development of regional calibration functions derived using many isoseismal radii. Such approaches allow magnitudes to be estimated for historical earthquakes. Estimating the focal depth The depth to the hypocenter can be estimated by comparing the sizes of different isoseismal areas. In shallow earthquakes, the lines are close together, while in deep events the lines are spread further apart. Confirming the focal mechanism Focal mechanisms are routinely calculated using teleseismic data, but an ambiguity remains as two potential fault planes always are possible. The shape of the areas of highest intensity are generally elongated along the direction of the active fault plane.  Testing seismic hazard assessments  Because of the relatively long history of macroseismic intensity observations (sometimes stretching back many centuries in some regions), isoseismal maps can be used to test seismic hazard assessments by comparing the expected temporal frequency of different levels of intensity, assuming an assessment is true and the observed rate of exceedance.

Vaidyanatha Iyer took Murthy to Tanjore, where Palghat Mani Iyer and Thambuswami (brother of eminent Carnatic vocalist T. M. Thiagarajan), were also undergoing training. Murthy's family was full of court musicians and he is the fifth generation of musicians. The family has been in music continuously for 7 generations now. His son T.K. Jayaraman was a music composer at All India Radio and grandson Karthikeya Murthy is a film music composer.  Career  Murthy made his debut at the age of eleven, at Coimbatore, in a concert of Musiri Subramania Iyer with Karur Chinnaswami Iyer on violin and Tanjore Vaidyanatha Iyer on mridangam. Murthy has performed in more than 15,000 concerts. In a career spanning over 80 years, Murthy has accompanied eminent artistes from several generations. Some of the notable artistes with whom Murthy has performed include Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar, Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Chembai Vaidhyanatha Bagavathar, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M. S. Subbulakshmi, Madurai Somasundaram, D. K. Jayaraman, M. Balamuralikrishna, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan, Lalgudi Jayaraman, T. V. Sankaranarayanan and U. Srinivas. Although Murthy is a staunch follower of the Thanjavur style of mridangam, he was highly influenced by the artistry of the legendary Palani Subramaniam Pillai of the Pudukottai school of mridangam playing. This blend of the Thanjavur and Pudukottai schools has become the hallmark of T.K.Murthy's special style. His style also incorporates highly calculative patterns delivered with striking clarity and suddenness.  Recognition  Murthy has received honors and awards including the following: * Laya Ratnakara from Sivananda Saraswati, Rishikesh, * Kalaimamani from the T.N. Iyal Isai Nataka Mandram, * Mridanga Bhoopathy from Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, * Mridanga Bhooshanam from Sri Sankaracharya of Kanchipuram, * Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1987, * Palghat Mani Iyer Award by Percussive Arts Centre, Bangalore, * Tala Vilas Award by Sur Singar Samsad, Bombay, * Kerala Sangeet Nataka Academy Fellowship, * Sangeetha Kalanidhi of The Music Academy. * Sangeet Natak Academy Fellowship, 2010 (See * Padma Shri by the Government of India, 2017 He was the Asthana Vidwan in Trivandrum Palace.

Biography=World War I Having served as a cadet in the Officers Training Corps Davidson was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry on 17 October 1914. He was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in March 1916, initially as an observer, before being appointed a flying officer on 5 June 1917. Davidson was posted to No. 14 Squadron in the Middle East, scoring his first victory with them, by driving down an enemy observation plane out of control at Beit Hanun on 23 September 1917, while flying a Vickers Bullet. He then transferred to No. 111 Squadron when it was founded as the fighter unit for the Middle East, and scored his second win on 4 October in a two-seater Bristol F.2 Fighter, which he also used for four more wins, between 17 and 29 December 1917. For one of these triumphs, fellow ace Frederick John Knowles manned the guns in the rear seat. Davidson's final score was three enemy planes forced to land and then destroyed, and three driven down out of control. He left 111 Squadron on 9 January 1918.Shores et.al. (1997), p.134. Listed as wounded on 7 February 1918, Davidson was promoted to lieutenant on 4 March 1918. In April 1918 his award of the Military Cross was gazetted, the citation reading: :Second Lieutenant (Temporary Lieutenant) Charles Robert Davidson, Highland Light Infantry, and Royal Flying Corps. :For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He forced a hostile aeroplane to land, and, descending to a low altitude, despite heavy rifle fire, shot down one of the occupants as he was escaping from the machine. On two later occasions, he forced an enemy machine to land, and drove down another, which was last seen diving into country in which it was impossible to land. Finally, though his ankle was fractured by a bullet during an air combat, he landed without injury either to his observer or his machine. Post-war career On 1 August 1919 Davidson was granted a permanent commission as a lieutenant in the RAF, resigning his Army commission in the Highland Light Infantry the same day. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in the King's New Years Honours, 1 January 1923. Davidson was posted to No. 20 Squadron, based in India, on 23 November 1923 then to the Headquarters of RAF India on 8 July 1927. He took part in Pinks War in Waziristan. His Medals include the India Star with the Clasp Waziristan which was only awarded to those who took part in Pink's war. He returned to the UK and was posted to the RAF Depot, Uxbridge, on 4 December 1928. On 10 June 1929 he was posted to No. 4 Squadron, based at South Farnborough, and on 11 March 1931 was promoted to squadron leader. Davidson was part of the RAF team that beat the Army in the Inter-Services Golf Championship held at West Hill in Woking in April 1931. On 5 June 1931 he was appointed to serve at the headquarters of RAF Transjordan and Palestine, based in Jerusalem, finally returning to the UK to serve as a flying instructor at No. 2 Flying Training School, based at RAF Digby, from 15 October 1934. Death Davidson was killed at RAF Digby on 21 May 1936 when he crashed in the Mignet HM.14 \\"Flying Flea\\" aircraft (registered on 4 February 1936 as G-AEBS) that he had built himself in the air station workshops. The \\"Flying Flea\\" was designed as a cheap and simple self-built aircraft for flying enthusiasts, but had a fatal flaw in its design, that could cause the aircraft to go into an uncontrollable dive if the pilot pushed the nose down to prevent a stall. Davidson was the third British pilot to die in a \\"Flying Flea\\" crash within a month, and the aircraft was eventually banned in the UK. Squadron Leader Davidson is buried at the Church of the Holy Cross, Scopwick, Lincolnshire. _Personal Life_ He Married Doris Davidson ( nee Heilbron) Daughter of Joseph Heilbron of Breda Holland.

Software Artisans, Inc., 3 F.3d 730 (4th Cir. 1993) was a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit discussed legal tests for software copyright infringement, and ruled that trade secret misappropriation requires more than circumstantial evidence. The case also ruled on what terms may be reasonable and enforceable in non-compete agreements. Background Virginia-based Comprehensive Technologies International (CTI) primarily dealt with defense-related services. In 1988, they created a software group and expanded into Electronic Data Interchange with Claims Express, targeted at the medical industries, and EDI Link, designed to make and use a range of forms. In February 1991, with EDI Link incomplete, seven CTI employees left the company and formed Software Artisans, Inc. (SA) in April 1991. Software Artisans created a program called Transend which also used EDI transmission to send forms. Transend was developed and marketed by July 1991. CTI sued Software Artisans and its former employees Marshall Dean Hawkes, Igor Filippides, Randall Sterba, Richard Hennig, David Bixler, Alvan Bixler, and Mark Hawkes for copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, breach of confidentiality, and breach of contract. CTI also alleged that Dean Hawkes violated his non-compete agreement. The district court ruled for the defendants on all counts. CTI appealed, and the case was argued in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 30, 1993. Copyright infringement The district court ruled against CTI's claims of copyright infringement, due to findings that Transend was not a literal copy of either of CTI's software programs, nor was it substantially similar to either in structure, sequence, and organization. CTI argued that the court should instead have compared with the ‚Äúabstraction-flitration- comparison‚Äù test used by the Second Circuit. The Fourth Circuit ruled that CTI did not meet their burden of proof because they did not indicate evidence from the trial that would have proven their point, therefore the district court's finding on copyright infringement claims were affirmed for the defendant. Trade secret misappropriation CTI's claims of trade secret misappropriation were also denied by the district court due to insufficient evidence. The district court found that CTI's claimed trade secrets did not fulfill the requirements of deriving independent economic value from not generally being known and not being readily ascertainable. In addition, the court concluded that there was no evidence that Software Artisans had copied CTI's claimed secret, which the court equated with misappropriation's requirement of \\"use\\" of the secret. Presented evidence of misappropriation was circumstantial: short development time and no documentation of the software design. Software Artisans' programmers testified that they preferred to work on a whiteboard and annotate their code rather than produce formal documentation, and an expert witnesses testified that it was common for small software companies to neglect formal documentation. This testimony was sufficient for the court to deny the circumstantial evidence that is common in such cases.Mark A. Lemley, Peter S. Menell, Robert P. Merges, and Pamela Samuelson, Software and Internet Law (3d ed. 2006). Non-compete agreement The district court declined to enforce Dean Hawkes' covenant not to compete, reasoning that it was broader than necessary according to Virginia's three- part test for assessing whether such restrictive covenants are reasonable: no greater restraint than is necessary from the employer's perspective, not unduly harsh from the employee's perspective, and reasonable in terms of sound public policy. On appeal, the court cited similar restrictions that were not deemed unreasonable in scope, and noted Hawkes' thorough knowledge of CTI's confidential information. With that ruling vacated, the decision on whether Hawkes breached his agreement was remanded to the district court.

A carriage control tape was a loop of punched tape that was used to synchronize rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the tape accurately using holes in the center of the tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer. Forms control buffer Newer printers use a \\"forms control buffer\\" (FCB), which is an electronic image of the physical carriage control tape. A job can request a specific FCB for a printout, and it will be loaded before printing is started, eliminating operator intervention. Conventions Conventionally, channel 1 indicates the top of the form (the first printable line on a page, often but not necessarily the first line of the page), and a new form is started with a \\"skip to channel 1\\" command (skipping is much faster than line spacing). Channel 9 is positioned a few lines above the end of the page, so a system that could sense the printer status while printing would, for example, have room to print a page footer or totals. Channel 12 indicates the last printable line of the form. These are only conventions, however, and applications are free to establish their own standards.

Contrary to the opinion of others in the IDF intelligence, Telem insisted on preparing for the war, the outbreak of which came as a surprise to most in the Israeli establishment.

The current superintendent is Dallas Earnshaw. History The Utah State Hospital, circa 1896 The Utah State Hospital began as the Territorial Insane Asylum in 1885 at Provo, Utah, with the purpose of housing and treating those considered to be mentally ill and attempting to return them to normal levels of functioning. However, due to limited knowledge about treatment of mental health at the time, the hospital became little more than a place for the mentally ill to live. The site chosen in Provo was eight blocks from the nearest residence and was separated from the city by swampland and the city dump. The supervising architect of the 1885-completed building was John H. Burton, who planned the building during the period from 1881 until his death, after which his assistant/colleague Richard K.A. Kletting was appointed. In 1903 the Asylum was renamed the Utah State Mental Hospital, and in 1927 it adopted its current name in an effort to eliminate the negative stigma associated with the word ‚Äúmental.‚Äù Long-term patients at the hospital engaged in work therapy, which gave them something to do and also made USH self-sustaining. The hospital originally sat on 600 acres of land, and housed a dairy, a hay barn, and a piggery, as well as chickens, rabbits, and pigeons. Residents took care of the animals and also harvested fruits and vegetables from the orchards and gardens on campus. As more and more patients began their indefinite incarceration at the hospital, problems of overcrowding arose. In the 1940s USH had 700 beds, but the hospital was housing over 1,100 patients. It was not uncommon to see mattresses lining the hallways, and the large surplus of patients made it difficult for staff members to focus their attention on individuals. Dr. Owen P. Heninger became the superintendent of USH in 1942. He recognized the need for change at the hospital, and as a result, he pioneered a new treatment philosophy. His new treatments included adopting smaller treatment units, involving patients in the implementation of their own treatment plans, and encouraging more humane treatment. Another influential figure in USH's history is Lucy Beth Rampton, Utah's first lady in the 60s and 70s. She was a well-respected member of the community who happened to struggle with depression. Her open discussion of her illness helped quell some of the stigma surrounding mental illness, and her advocacy for treatment of mental illness helped raise awareness about mental health in Utah. In 1969, USH's role changed. Care for the mentally ill shifted from institutional care to community-based care. Treatment was offered closer to home. USH eventually adopted the practice that it still follows today: only those with severe mental illness are admitted for ongoing treatment. Today the Utah State Hospital provides 324 beds for Utah's mentally ill persons who require treatment in a more structured setting and are assessed to be unable to receive adequate treatment at regional centers. Those patients include children, youth, and adults. USH now provides numerous therapy options, as well as a forensics unit to rehabilitate patients who have committed criminal acts or are accused but not competent to stand trial. Patients stay at USH for an average of six months. The hospital has developed specialized programs for children, youth, and adults. USH offers a wide variety of treatments to accommodate patients‚Äô needs. Some treatments involve physical and occupational therapy, while others, such as pediatric playgroups, community cooking, and outdoor youth activities, contribute to overall mental and emotional well- being. Internal structure of the Utah State Hospital=Overview The governor of Utah is in charge of UHS, but day-to-day operations fall under the direction of the hospital's superintendent. The superintendent works primarily with Utah's Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH). DSAMH has created a governing body to oversee the operations of USH. This body includes the superintendent, the director of DSAMH, the clinical director and the medical-staff president of USH, representatives of the Department of Human Services, patients, and patients‚Äô families. The governing body authorizes the hospital executive staff to manage the hospital's daily operations. The superintendent reports all major matters concerning hospital operations to the governing body during regular meetings. The clinical director reports to the governing body regarding the operations of the hospital medical staff, professional discipline directors, and other clinical and administrative services. Internal structure The superintendent is appointed by the director of the Department of Human Services (DHS) with the joint approval of the DSAMH director. The superintendent is responsible for USH's buildings, grounds, and property. The superintendent also recommend staffing needs to the director of DSAMH and to the director of DHS. Right now, USH has 753 employees. The state of Utah and the U.S. government provide operational policies and procedures governing personnel matters, fiscal accounting, purchasing records, and life safety. USH's on-call procedure provides 24-hour physician and administrator services. Employee infrastructure The executive staff of the hospital manages all USH administrative and clinical services. This executive team consists of the hospital clinical director, the assistant superintendent, the assistant clinical director, the nursing administrator, the director of Forensic and Safety Services, the chief financial officer, the human resources director, the director of quality resources, and the administrative assistants. The superintendent is responsible for hiring the members of the executive team. He or she is also a liaison with DSAMH, DHS, courts, the state legislature, and the governmental offices with which USH interacts. In addition, the superintendent may choose to delegate some of his or her own responsibilities to the staff as needed. The hospital clinical director is directly responsible for supervising the assistant clinical director and the director of medical services. In addition, the hospital clinical director supervises psychiatrists, medical consultants, directors of the professional disciplines, patient advocates, physicians, and pharmacy contracts. The assistant superintendent helps both the superintendent and the clinical director. The assistant clinical director and the admissions officer help the clinical director run the treatment mall, pastoral services, volunteer services, recreation therapy, occupational therapy, vocational rehabilitation, psychology services, social work, substance abuse rehabilitation, and other standing committees. The nurse executive supervises the education and discipline of the nursing administrators. The director of Forensic and Safety Services assists the superintendent in monitoring security, legal services, and risk management. The chief financial officer reports financial planning and budgeting to you and the executive staff. The human resources manager is in charge of personnel. The quality resources director administers quality improvement processes. Budget process Each year the Utah State Legislature and the governor approve USH's budget. Over the past several years, the budget has been fairly consistent. About 80 percent of the budget comes from the general state fund, which is supported by revenue from state taxes. The remaining 20 percent comes from Medicare and Medicaid. Expense breakdown About 80 percent of USH's total budget covers personnel costs, and another 15 percent goes toward medication and food. The remaining 5 percent covers other overhead, which consists mainly of facility maintenance. Patient services The services USH provides can be broken down into three main categories: adult mental health, pediatric mental health, and forensic services. The adult-services division provides an environment in which patients are treated with dignity and respect. Through individualized treatment, patients are eventually able to return to the community to continue their lives. The pediatric-services division serves around 25 boys and girls from 6 to 13 years old. These children face mental, emotional, and behavioral problems. The pediatric-services division also serves about 50 youth from 14 to 18 years old. The therapies most commonly used with this age group fall into the categories of abuse treatment, anger management, emotional management, and recreational therapy. The forensic-services division consists of four maximum-security psychiatric-treatment units and serves about 100 male and female patients. These patients are admitted to USH by mandate of the Utah District Courts. Treatment for such patients includes medication, individual, group, and family therapy, work opportunities, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. In addition to ongoing treatment of mental illness, USH also provides chaplain services, health clinics, dietetic services, nursing services, occupational therapy, psychiatric services, psychological services, physical therapy, social services, therapeutic recreation services, and vocational rehabilitation. Challenges=Financial and personnel challenges Most of USH's budget covers the salaries of full- and part-time employees. The superintendent has the responsibility of recruiting, training, and retaining quality employees. Since USH cannot compete with private-sector wages, the hospital needs to be creative in offering incentives to its employees. Social stigma surrounding mental health Despite increased public awareness in recent years, there is still a negative stigma attached to mental health issues. Sometimes, because of this stigma, people who are mentally ill are ashamed to seek the treatment they need. In addition, the stigma may affect the amount of funding that the hospital receives in comparison to other state institutions and projects. Limited public awareness USH is probably one of the most secure facilities in the state, aside from the state prisons. Because it is so inaccessible to the public, members in the community often do not understand what goes on inside the hospital. Some Provo residents do not even know the hospital exists. This lack of awareness makes it difficult to educate the public about mental health and the resources that are available for victims of mental illness. Work with third parties USH works with other organizations on a daily basis. These organizations include mental health centers, state and federal governments, district courts, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Mental health centers In addition to USH, Utah has 13 community mental-health centers throughout Utah. These community centers are the entry point for patients who need medical attention for mental illness. Patients first receive treatment in one of the community care centers. Those patients who need extended treatment are sent to USH. The hospital also works with acute-care facilities such as the University Neuropsychiatric Institute and Salt Lake Behavioral Health. These institutions provide temporary care for the mentally ill. As with the community care centers, if patients require long-term care they are transferred to USH. State legislature and federal policies and funding The state legislature is an important overseer of USH. The state legislature must approve budgets, resource reallocations, and all other major decisions. The federal policies surrounding Medicaid are an important regulatory aspect of patient care. USH cannot provide care without Medicaid funding, so it is essential that administrators understand and abide by the regulations. State district courts Utah State District Court judges decide which individuals need to be admitted to USH and when they are ready to be discharged. Social workers are also involved in the treatment plan of patients. The National Alliance on Mental Illness The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) initiates public-awareness campaigns and other initiatives. As superintendent, you and your colleagues will have to decide which of NAMI's initiatives you want to adopt and to what extent DSAMH and USH should implement them. Haunted Castle The amphitheater's castle tower, June 2018 Starting October 1971 the Utah State Hospital started a \\"spook alley\\" titled the Haunted Castle, due to the stone structured amphitheater located behind the hospital in which the attraction was assembled. The Haunted Castle started off as a \\"closed\\" Halloween celebration event developed by the patients, but success with the activity eventually caused it to grow to a more public performance. The attraction was operated in a joint effort by patients and staff. Patient participation was a privilege and based on individual patient behavior and only those determined to be a minimal risk to themselves or others were allowed access to the public. Additionally, many patients not able to interact with the public were allowed to help with construction/deconstruction of the facilities used for the spook alley. The Utah State Hospital used popularity from the event to help raise public awareness of mental illness. All proceeds from the Haunted Castle went into the Utah State Hospital's recreational therapy program to subsidize improved activities that directly benefited the patients. October 1997 was the final production put on by the State Hospital. The activity was permanently closed largely due to efforts by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) who objected to the activity because they felt it served to stereotype the patients by linking mental illness with monsters and violence in the public's mind. Several doctors, therapists, and patients at the hospital cited that the activity produced therapeutic results unachievable elsewhere which should be taken into account, but the Utah State Legislature determined that NAMI's objections were warranted.

The saprobic species has been found in Africa, Europe, Central America, and North America, where it grows on soil in deciduous woods, glades, and pastures. It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, Lycoperdon americanum, but this suggestion has not been followed by most authors. Molecular analysis indicates that L. echinatum is closely related to the puffball genus Handkea. The fruit bodies of L. echinatum are wide by tall, supported by a small base, and densely covered with spines that are up to long. The spines can fall off in maturity, leaving a net-like pattern of scars on the underlying surface. Initially white in color, the puffballs turn a dark brown as they mature, at the same time changing from nearly round to somewhat flattened. Young specimens of L. echinatum resemble another edible spiny puffball, Lycoperdon pulcherrimum, but the latter species does not turn brown as it ages. The fruit bodies are edible when young, when the interior is white and firm and before it has turned into a powdery brown mass of spores. Laboratory tests have shown that extracts of the fruit bodies can inhibit the growth of several bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797. It was later reduced to a variety of Lycoperdon gemmatum (as L. gemmatum var. echinatum; L. gemmatum is now known as Lycoperdon perlatum) by Elias Magnus Fries, but American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who extensively studied the North American distribution of the genus, raised it again to species level in 1879. He thought it worthy of status as a species distinct from L. gemmatum because of the different character of its warts, its much spinier appearance, and the smoother surface of the peridium underneath the spines. Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome wrote of the fungus in 1871, but believed their specimen, collected from Reading, Berkshire, by Hoyle, represented a new species, which they called Lycoperdon Hoylei. They wrote that their specimen agreed \\"exactly with an authentic specimen of Persoon's L. echinatum externally, who could, however, scarcely have overlooked the lilac spores.\\" Despite the apparent difference in spore color, L. Hoylei is currently considered synonymous with L. echinatum. Utraria echinata, named by Lucien Qu√©let in 1873, is another synonym for L. echinatum. In 1972, Vincent Demoulin described the species Lycoperdon americanum on the basis of a specimen found in North Carolina. Although he believed it to be a unique species, several authors consider it synonymous with L. echinatum. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes coding for the internal transcribed spacer units suggests that Lycoperdon echinatum forms a clade with the puffball genus Handkea, separate from the type species of Lycoperdon, Lycoperdon perlatum. In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, L. echinatum formed a clade with L. mammiforme, L. foetidum, and Bovistella radicata (now known as Lycoperdon radicatum), but separate from L. pyriforme. The species is commonly known as the \\"spiny puffball\\" or the \\"spring puffball\\"; Peck referred to the species as the \\"echinate puff-ball\\". The specific epithet echinatum is derived from the Greek word echinos (ŒµœáŒπŒΩŒøœÇ) meaning \\"hedgehog\\" or \\"sea-urchin\\". Description The fruit bodies of L. echinatum are wide by tall, and are roughly spherical, or pear-shaped. The exterior surface is crowded with spines that may be up to long. According to Curtis Gates Lloyd, American specimens have more slender spines than European ones. Initially white and becoming dark brown in maturity, the spines are often joined at the tips in groups of three or four. In this form the puffballs resemble acorn caps of burr oak, with which they may readily be confused. The spines slough off in age, revealing a somewhat net-like or reticulated surface. The fruit body has a small base that is an off-white or purple-gray color, and it may be attached to the growing surface by thin white cords (rhizomorphs). The internal contents of the puffball contain the gleba, a mass of spores and associated spore-producing cells. In young specimens the gleba is white and firm, but as the puffball ages, it turns yellowish and then brown to purple-brown and powdery. Mature specimens develop a pore at the top of the fruit body through which spores are released when hit by falling raindrops. The spores of L. echinatum, roughly spherical with warts on the surface, have diameters between 4 and 6 ¬µm. The capillitia (coarse thick- walled hyphae in the gleba) are elastic, brown in color, contain small pores, and are 5‚Äì8 ¬µm thick. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) may be attached to two to four spores, and the sterigmata (tapered spine-like projections from the basidia that attach the spores) are up to 5 ¬µm long. Like most other puffball species, L. echinatum is edible when still young and while the gleba is still white and firm. Consumption of older specimens with a non-white gleba, or where the gleba has turned into a powdery spore mass, may cause stomach upsets. This species has a mild taste, and no distinguishable odor, although one source describes the smell of dried fruit bodies as similar to \\"old ham\\".Coker et al., 1974 [1928], pp. 73‚Äì5. One source notes that it is \\"well flavoured and tender when cooked\\", while another describes the texture (of edible puffballs in general) as \\"somewhat like French toast\\". Antonio Carluccio recommends saut√©eing puffballs with other mushrooms. To avoid possible confusion with potentially deadly Amanita species, it is recommended to slice young puffballs with a longitudinal cut to ensure that the flesh is devoid of any internal structures. Similar species Lycoperdon pulcherrimum has stouter spines than L. echinatum. Lycoperdon pulcherrimum closely resembles L. echinatum, but its spines are stouter, do not turn brown in age, and the surface of the fruit body underneath the spines is smooth, not pitted. Alexander H. Smith noted that in youth, they are \\"difficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other, but this will cause no inconvenience to those collecting for the table, since both are edible.\\" In some areas the two species appear to intergrade, as specimens may be found whose spines turn brown but do not fall off. Young specimens of L. pedicellatum may also be difficult to distinguish from L. echinatum, but the former has a smooth outer surface when mature, and has spores attached to a pedicel (a narrow extension of the basidium on which the sterigmata and spores are formed) that is about 4‚Äì5 times as long as the spore.Coker et al., 1974 [1928], pp. 85‚Äì86. Retrieved 2010-05-17. Lycoperdon compactum, found only in New Zealand, also resembles L. echinatum in appearance, but differs in having smaller spores, capillitia that are hyaline (translucent) and septate (with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments). Habitat, distribution, and ecology Lycoperdon echinatum can be found either solitary or in small groups. It typically grows on the ground in deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens are more likely to be overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food. This species has been collected from eastern central Africa, China, Costa Rica, Iran, Japan, and Europe (including Britain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland). In North America, it is \\"locally frequent\\" east of the Rocky Mountains. It is considered a threatened species in the √Öland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites have been shown to bioaccumulate arsenic, largely in the form of arsenobetaine. Antimicrobial activity Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Lycoperdon umbrinum fruit bodies were shown in a 2005 study to have \\"significant\\" antibacterial activity against various human pathogenic bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. An earlier study (2000) had identified weak antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Although the specific compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity have not been identified, chemical analysis confirms the presence of terpenoids, a class of widely occurring organic chemicals that are being investigated for their potential use as antimicrobial drugs.

The new Pembrokeshire Bank was located in the centre of the lower end of High Street, Haverfordwest, known as Short Row, and since pulled down. Later on, the Bank moved, successively, to three other buildings on the High Street. John Walters died shortly after the establishment of the new Pembroke Bank, and William Walters carried on the business by himself. Branches were opened in Narberth, in 1863, Milford Haven, and Pembroke Dock. After the death of William Walters, on 20 December 1872, his estate was disposed of by his trustees, on behalf of his 15-year-old son, William Howell Walters. The Bank and leasehold premises at Haverfordwest and Narberth were sold to the London and Provincial Bank Ltd. The purchase price was calculated on a sliding scale according to the increase in the total deposits and credit balances at the different branches of the purchasing bank in Pembrokeshire on 1 January the following year. London and Provincial Bank Ltd. was absorbed by London Provincial and South Western Bank Ltd., which became part of Barclays Bankhttp://www.personal.barclays.co.uk/PFS/A/Content/Files/list_constituent_banks.pdf Retrieved 6 October 2009 William Walters was sheriff for Pembrokeshire in 1866. William Howell Walters became sheriff for Pembrokeshire in 1898, and a justice of the peace for Haverfordwest and Pembrokeshire. Bank notes The earliest bank note in existence for the old Pembrokeshire Bank is for ¬£1 and is dated 8 December 1825. It is embellished with a view of Pembroke Castle. A bank note for the Narberth and Pembrokeshire Bank is in existence for ¬£1, dated 1 October 1824. It bears an illustration of two yoked oxen. Both bank notes have a memorandum stamped across their face stating that each note was exhibited on 22 July and 24 July 1826, respectively, under a commission of bankruptcy against the named partners in the Pembrokeshire Bank. The new Pembrokeshire Bank used on its bank notes the same view of Pembroke Castle previously used by the old Pembrokeshire Bank. However, because the new Pembrokeshire Bank was absorbed by the London and Provincial Bank Ltd., instead of being wound up, its bank notes are very rare. The Institute of Bankers hold a ¬£5 bank note. The only other bank note known to exist is for ¬£5, and is dated 1 July 1863. In both notes, the portion bearing the signature has been cut off. Other Pembrokeshire banks Other Pembrokeshire banks include: Haverfordwest Bank, J. Dunn & Co., Tenby, Union Bank (Pembrokeshire), Milford Bank, Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank, and Lock, Hulme & Co.

Background  CitySprouts began in 2001 when a small group of parents, a teacher and a school principal came together to create a schoolyard learning garden that would be accessible to every child in their school. They were motivated by a variety of factors. They knew there were too few opportunities for urban children to explore their natural environment. They felt public school teachers‚Äô need for more hands-on, experiential learning, especially in science. Lastly, they shared concern about children knowing little about food systems, including where their own food came from. They believed school gardens could have an enormous impact on both children‚Äôs learning and on their good health. They envisioned a schoolyard garden with natural habitats that invited children to wonder and explore, and a place to gain important social skills and taste food they had grown themselves. Few school garden models existed that were designed for access by struggling public schools. CitySprouts‚Äô founders were guided by the vision of learning gardens in urban, high-need schools that were woven into the fabric of the school community. CitySprouts quickly developed an on-going collaboration with Cambridge Public School science department to ensure strong connections between the district‚Äôs school learning gardens and its STEM curriculum. By 2009 the CitySprouts program had expanded to every K-8 school in Cambridge Public School District. In 2012, CitySprouts began building an equivalent sized cohort of school partnerships in Boston Public Schools. CitySprouts soon launched a school garden-based summer and after school program for middle schoolers based on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) practices through an ecosystems and food systems lens. In 2018, CitySprouts announced an early learning initiative in partnership with Boston schools. Through a year- long series of teacher workshops, CitySprouts early learning initiative will bridge the PreK ‚Äì Grade 2 science standards and the school learning garden to increase the number of Boston children entering third grade with a solid foundation in scientific thinking and content knowledge. CitySprouts is notable in the field of garden-based education for its long-standing relationships with the school districts it serves. Both Cambridge Public Schools and Boston Public Schools have contracts with CitySprouts that provide a significant portion of the program‚Äôs operating expenses. CitySprouts is a charter member of the Boston Public School Portfolio Opportunity, organizations vetted for program quality and alignment with the district‚Äôs goals. CitySprouts was selected as a charter organization in the BoSTEM education, innovation & research initiative in 2017. Over the course of its history, CitySprouts has emerged as a leader in the 21st century garden-based education movement. It was recognized in 2008 as a regional social innovator by Boston-based Social Innovation Forum. In 2015, founding director Jane Hirschi published Ripe for Change: Garden-Based Learning in Schools (Harvard Education Press 2015), describing the new model of garden-based learning in urban school districts around the country Mission The CitySprouts mission is to develop, implement, and maintain beautiful, resource-rich school gardens in collaboration with public school communities. Integrated into the curriculum, CitySprouts gardens inspire teachers, students, and families to develop a deep, connection to hands-on science, edible education, and the opportunity to explore the natural world in the neighborhoods where they live, learn, and play.

It was discovered on 22 August 1987, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory, California. It was later named after American Thomas Hamilton, author of astronomy books and participant in the Apollo program.  Classification and orbit  Tomhamilton orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.4 AU once every 5 years and 4 months (1,953 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 11¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. In August 1950, a first precovery was taken at Palomar, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 37 years prior to its official discovery observation. It had also been previously identified as and at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij. On 11 January 2011, it was at opposition (coinciding with Hamilton's 72nd birthday) at a distance of 2.476 AU. Given the moderately elliptical orbit, this asteroid can on rare occasions reach an apparent magnitude from Earth of about 10.9.  Physical characteristics = Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Tomhamilton measures 13.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.215, which indicates that it of a stony rather than of a carbonaceous composition.  Lightcurve  As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of Tomhamilton has been obtained from photometric observations. It rotation period, poles and shape remain unknown.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Thomas William Hamilton, an American (born San Francisco, 1939) who was a child actor (he played \\"Barnaby\\" in Barnaby and Mr. O'Malley and was on the early television show Mr. I-Magination). As an adult he worked on the Apollo program, determining fuel requirements and radar accuracy requirements for lunar orbit rendezvous. He later worked as an astronomy educator and planetarium director, and is the author of time travel and science fiction novels, and also wrote five books on astronomical topics. Hamilton and Helin were acquainted, as he had interviewed her at an astronomical conference for a cable television show he was producing at the time. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 October 2009 ().  Books by Hamilton  * Books on astronomical topics: ** Useful Star Names ** Our Neighbor Stars ** Moons of the Solar System ** Dwarf Planets and Asteroids **Impact Craters of Earth * Other books: ** Time for Patriots, a time travel adventure novel ** The Mountain of Long Eyes, an anthology of 27 stories of fantasy, science fiction, and satire. ** Weird Thoughts, a mixed anthology of 17 stories of science fiction, fantasy, and satire; plus seven essays on topics related to astronomy, including one describing the author's experience working on the Apollo Project. ** Scam Artists of the Galaxy, 19 stories of a pair of cousins cheating their way across planets.

She was first elected in the 2011 federal election, succeeding Member of Parliament Helena Guergis who was dismissed from the Conservative Party caucus. Following her election, Leitch was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. On July 15, 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper named Leitch Minister of Labour and Minister for the Status of Women. She served in Cabinet until the defeat of the Conservative government in the 2015 federal election. Leitch ran in the 2017 contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party. On January 23, 2018, Leitch announced that she would not be seeking re-election for the 43rd Canadian federal election and would return to being a full-time surgeon.  Training and medical career  Leitch was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the daughter of Eleanor Lynne (Conway) and Kelburne \\"Kit\\" McNabb Leitch, who owned and operated a construction company. She was raised a Catholic, and still practises the religion. She graduated from Queen's University in 1991 with an undergraduate degree. She earned her MD from the University of Toronto in 1994, MBA from Dalhousie University in 1998, and completed the Orthopaedic Surgery Residency Program in 2001 at the University of Toronto. She became a fellow of clinical paediatric orthopaedics at Children's Hospital Los Angeles/University of Southern California in 2002. Leitch formerly taught at the University of Western Ontario, where she served as the assistant dean of external affairs at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, and is a former chair of paediatric surgery at the Children's Hospital of Western Ontario. She was an orthopaedic pediatric surgeon at SickKids Hospital for one year before pursuing a career in politics. Leitch is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto. Leitch was the founding chair of the Ivey Centre for Health Innovation and Leadership and led the health sector stream of the MBA programme at the Richard Ivey School of Business located at the University of Western Ontario. In 2009, Leitch founded the Kids Health Foundation (now known as The Sandbox Project), an organization that sought to work with academia, the not-for-profit sector, government and industry to make Canada the healthiest place on earth for children to grow up. Leitch has maintained her medical credentials while serving in politics, and has hospital privileges at Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa.  Political involvement  Leitch is an active member of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. She was a strategist in Progressive Conservative MPP Christine Elliott's leadership bid in 2009. She also served as president of the Ontario PC Campus Association, and has been actively involved in the Conservative Party since she was 14. Leitch served as chair of the expert panel for the Children's Fitness Tax Credit in 2006, which made recommendations to Jim Flaherty, Minister of Finance, regarding the best ways to implement this tax credit designed to encourage health and fitness among Canadian children. In 2008, Leitch authored the report entitled Reaching for the Top: A Report by the Advisor on Healthy Children & Youth. The report is a \\"call to action\\" for government and industry on key issues affecting Canadian children and youth. Leitch serves on the boards for CANFAR, the National Research Council, YMCA, and Genome Canada, among others. Federal politics On September 17, 2010, The Globe and Mail reported that Leitch would run for the Conservative nomination in Simcoe-Grey. The seat was, at the time, held by Helena Guergis, who was expelled from the Conservative Party. The Globe described Leitch as a \\"star candidate\\" and noted that her launch event in Creemore the following day would include former Ontario premier Bill Davis and federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. Leitch won the nomination over Collingwood mayor Chris Carrier and Paul Throop with 67% of all ballots cast in a large turnout. Leitch won the general election with more votes than any candidate for public office had ever received in Simcoe-Grey, with 31,784 ballots cast for her and a plurality of 20,590 votes, or 49.36% of the vote. Following her election, Leitch was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. Minister of Labour and Minister for the Status of Women As part of the February 2014 budget, Leitch announced a $25 million plan to address violence against aboriginal women and girls. On July 15, 2013, Prime Minister Harper named Leitch Minister of Labour and Minister for the Status of Women. During the 2015 Canadian federal election, Leitch said that she was pro-life when asked at a local debate, citing her experience as a paediatric surgeon as her reason. Chris Alexander in 2015.https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2015/01/canada-india- continue-build-strong-economic-ties.html On October 2, 2015, during the general election, Leitch and then-Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Chris Alexander announced a Royal Canadian Mounted Police \\"tip line\\" where Canadians could report \\"barbaric cultural practices\\", which, along with the niqab issue, was widely viewed as an attempt to keep cultural and immigration issues at the forefront of the election campaign. Leitch later expressed regret in her involvement of the \\"barbaric cultural practices tip line\\". However, in an interview, on the statement the tip line \\"is a good idea but wasn‚Äôt communicated as effectively as it could be to the public\\" she characterised it as being \\"absolutely correct\\". Conservative leadership election Although Leitch was re-elected in the 2015 election, the Conservatives were relegated to Official Opposition status. During the election, Leitch campaigned with over 70 Conservative candidates, which prepared the groundwork for her participation in the 2017 Conservative leadership election to replace Stephen Harper. Leitch's policy stances faced similar controversy in October 2015 during the federal election, where she and fellow Conservative MP and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander pledged support and funding to establish a tip-line for Canadians to call in regards to what they called \\"barbaric cultural practices\\". Leitch has since made an effort to apologize for her role in the proposed legislation, saying that she regrets her decisions. She recruited Nick Kouvalis and Richard Ciano to head her leadership campaign, and Andy Pringle of the Toronto Police Services Board was her chief fundraiser. Leitch was the first official candidate to enter the race. As part of her leadership campaign, Leitch proposed a Canadian value screening for all new residents. Michael Chong, Conservative MP for Wellington-Halton Hills and an opponent of Leitch in the leadership race, spoke out against Leitch's proposal, saying that it \\"does not represent our Conservative Party or our Canada\\". Despite the censure, Leitch stood by her proposal. In a September interview with the Canadian Press, Leitch made the following statement in response to the backlash she had been receiving: \\"I don‚Äôt think it's intolerant to believe in a set of values that we expect everyone to share here and include those people who are coming to visit or immigrate to Canada.\\" The focus of her campaign around the policies surprised some of her long-time mentors, such as former Conservative senator Hugh Segal, who couldn't support her leadership bid. Leitch proposed screening visitors, refugees and immigrants for \\"Canadian values\\". This process would include face to face interviews by trained immigration officers with 100% of immigrants, rather than the 10% or so that happens now, with questions pertaining to their views on whether Canadian law should be the only set of laws that applies to all Canadians, hate speech, violence, and equality between genders, sexual orientation, religious & political views. Stephen Maher, based on information he received from former staffers of Letich, argued that her campaign manager Nick Kouvalis, thought that it would give Leitch, a way to win. In a November 9, 2016 interview with Toronto Life magazine, Leitch cited the belief that gays should not be sentenced to death as an example of one such Canadian value. During the campaign she was endorsed by Council of European Canadians, but her campaign rejected the endorsement. Regarding the endorsement, Leitch said that for anyone to think her campaign is in any way based on ethnic nationalism is to be willfully ignorant of what her campaign is about. Leitch finished sixth in the race.  After the leadership race  She was not included into Andrew Scheer's shadow cabinet. In December 2017, it was reported that Essa Township Mayor Terry Dowdall and physician Gillian Yeates were challenging Leitch for the Conservative nomination in Simcoe‚ÄîGrey for the next election. On January 23, 2018, Leitch announced that she would not seek re-election. Leitch threw her support towards Marc Biss and Tim Bulmer, to be the party candidate for her riding arguing that they were \\"real conservatives\\" while believing Yeates and Dowdall were not. On March 24, it was announced that Dowdall won the party nomination for her riding after it was rumoured that he defeated Yeates on the third ballot. On January 23, 2018, Leitch announced that she would not be seeking re-election for the 43rd Canadian federal election and would return to being a full-time surgeon. As of December 1, 2019, she is chief of orthopaedic surgery at Children‚Äôs of Mississippi.https://www.umc.edu/news/Miscellaneous/2019/December/December%20Giving%20and%20Growing/CC12022019.html  Electoral history  References External links Category:1970 births Category:Canadian pediatricians Category:Canadian orthopedic surgeons Category:Canadian women physicians Category:20th-century Canadian physicians Category:Women members of the House of Commons of Canada Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Dalhousie University alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the 28th Canadian Ministry Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Members of the Order of Ontario Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Politicians from Winnipeg Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:University of Western Ontario faculty Category:Women in Ontario politics Category:Women's ministers Category:Women government ministers of Canada Category:21st-century Canadian women politicians Category:Women surgeons Category:Physician-politicians Category:Physicians from Ontario Category:20th-century women physicians ","title":"Kellie Leitch"},{"id":"24598251","text":"Sakellarios (), genitive and feminine form Sakellariou (), is a Greek surname deriving from the Byzantine office of sakellarios.

Adolf Hermann Freiherr Marschall von Bieberstein (12 October 1842 in Karlsruhe ‚Äì 24 September 1912 in Badenweiler) was a German politician and State Secretary of the Foreign Office of the German Empire. Biography Marschall von Bieberstein's father, Augustus Marschall von Bieberstein, was chamberlain to the Grand Duke of Baden, and his mother, before her marriage, was Baroness von Falkenstein. He was educated at the Gymnasium of Frankfurt am Main, and studied jurisprudence at the Universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg. He was a member of the Corps Suevia, a Studentenverbindung. After finishing his studies, he started on a career in government, working as a prosecutor in Mosbach und Mannheim. His career as a politician began in 1875, as a representative in the First Chamber of Baden; from 1878 to 1881 he was also a member of the Reichstag for the German Conservative Party and at first supported Bismarck, but then he undertook an oppositional stance towards Bismarck, after the latter turned towards the conservatives in 1879. From 1883 to 1890 Marschall von Bieberstein was the envoy of the Grand Duchy of Baden in Berlin, and participated in the fall of Bismarck in 1890. In 1890 he succeeded Herbert von Bismarck as State Secretary of the Foreign Office under Otto von Bismarck's successor Leo von Caprivi. When he first assumed office, he incurred the enmity of Bismarck by refusing his advice. The result was a fierce press campaign against Marschall von Bieberstein. He supported Caprivi's reconciliation policy through trade agreements and sought compromise with Britain. After Caprivi's dismissal in 1894, Marschall von Bieberstein succeeded him as Foreign Minister of Prussia while remaining State Secretary under the new Chancellor Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst. Marschall von Bieberstein was increasingly involved in disputes with Wilhelm II, who aspired to have a greater personal influence on foreign policy. He was also opposed by the Agrarians because he advocated the reduction of corn duties. In 1897, he was dismissed from both his offices and replaced by Bernhard von B√ºlow. Marschall von Bieberstein was transferred to Constantinople as ambassador. Through economic co-operation between the German and the Ottoman Empire, he wanted to extend Germany's relations with the Orient. The Baghdad Railway played a central role in this. Thanks to Marschall von Bieberstein's efforts, a predominantly German consortium received the concession to build the Baghdad Railway. Marschall von Bieberstein was the representative of the German Empire at the Second Peace Conference in The Hague in 1907. An advocate of a strong naval policy for Germany, he was the exponent of Germany's resolute and successful opposition to any practical discussion of the question of restriction of armaments. In 1912, shortly prior to his death, he became ambassador in London. He received the task to achieve a turnaround in the tense Anglo-German relations. Shortly after taking office, however, he died on 24 September 1912, aged 69.

Becoming the third honv√©d in September 1848 he acted as commander of the southern areas. In October, the Ministry of Defence appointed him as the superintendent of military equipment and armaments in the rank of colonel. In this capacity, he was focused on the Hungarian arms production and boosting production. Lahner successfully completed the most organized changes and productions then to date in Hungary and as a result boosted munitions supply. However, due to the onslaught of Windisch-Gr√§tz, he was forced to retire in December 1848 from Pest, and re-establish facilities in the east. Lahner planned an organized and professional evacuation and decommissioning of the plants so that there was the possibility to continue on the fight. On February 6, 1849 he was promoted to the rank of general. Despite the hardship of evacuating the machinery, Lahner was able to erect new facilities in Nagyv√°rad (present-day Oradea) in a minimum loss of time and began production again very quickly and made launching a spring offensive a possibility. Nagyv√°rad became the largest arms and munitions producer and cache in all of Hungary. The facilities for producing various weapons, firearms, bayonets, swords, were placed in different parts of the nearby castles, such as the dungeons. Lahner published a military science work under the headline \\"Do not hurt the Hungarians\\" in May 1849. The Military Council decided that after some months the munitions depots and factories should be moved back to Budapest, closer to the action on the front. Lahner was distinguished with exemplary leadership and performance. Death Execution of the Martyrs of Arad. Work by J√°nos Thorma. Lahner's resting place at Necp√°l After the defeat of the uprising, Lahner was captured and sentenced to death by hanging, and carried out on his birthday. The sheriff of his home town bribed the executioners to allow him to take his body back to Necp√°l to be buried there where it rested until 1974, when the bones were moved to a crypt.

It should not be confused with another two Anglo-American AUVs that share the same name: the American Autonomous Benthic Explorer AUV (ABE) built by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the British Columbia- based International Submarine Engineering built Canadian Explorer AUV, which is based on its earlier ARCS AUV. Explore AUV is the first member of a series of Chinese AUVs later developed, all of which are based on Explorer AUV. Explorer AUV is one of the projects of 863-512 subprogram of the 863 Program in PRC, developed by a joint team of research and educational establishments including the 702nd Research Institute702nd Research Institute (‰∏≠ÂõΩËàπËà∂ÈáçÂ∑•ÈõÜÂõ¢ÂÖ¨Âè∏Á¨¨702Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), Shenyang Institute of Automation (Ê≤àÈò≥Ëá™Âä®ÂåñÊâÄ) of Chinese Academy of Science, Shipbuilding Engineering Institute (ËàπËà∂Â∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢) of Harbin Engineering University (HEU), Institute of Underwater Engineering (Ê∞¥‰∏ãÂ∑•Á®ãÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SHJTU), and other establishments totaling over a dozen. Feng Xisheng (Â∞ÅÈî°Áõõ), a professor of Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of HEU was named at the general designer of Explorer AUV, while Xu Huangnan (ÂæêËäëÂçó), a professor of School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering (ËàπËà∂‰∏éÊµ∑Ê¥ãÂ∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢) of SHJTU and the general designer of 8A4 class ROUVs, was named as the deputy general designer of Explorer AUV. Explorer AUV is the first AUV of PRC. The brain of Explorer AUV consists of three computers: central control computer, positioning computer, and imagery computer. In addition to controlling the interface tracing the traveling path and the interface controlling the surveillance of the system, the central control computer controls the interface controlling remotely operated module so that in addition to being able to operate as an AUV, the Explorer AUV can also be operated as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROUV). To accurately provide the positional parameters of the Explore AUV in the water such as pitch, row, yaw, depth, distance and location, the navigational system of the Explorer AUV utilizes a number of methodologies, including GPS, Doppler Velocity Measurement, directional gyro, short baseline positioning, ultra short baseline positioning, visual tracking and fluxgate compass. Information provided by these subsystems are fed and processed by the navigational computer on board. The compressed underwater television images are handled by the imagery computer. These on board electronics are powered by the main propulsion system consisted of lead-acid batteries with 120 V direct current, which is converted to 220 V alternate current to power the electronic equipment. The communication system of Explorer AUV consists of surface communication subsystem and underwater communication subsystem, and the two are linked via acoustic communication module, which passed the information received from underwater communication computer and pass it on the central computer. The central control computer analyzes this information, including sending the compressed television imagery signals to imagery computer, which in turn, convert the information to display the image on the screen. The communication between the central control computer and positioning computer is achieved via RS-232 interface, while GPS information is received from the positioning computer via EIA-422 interface. In addition to sending the information to control the AUV, the central computer is also designed to communicate and interface the operating console on the mother ship when needed. The underwater communication system of Explorer AUV consists of two major components, the sonar controlling module and communication computer (via CPU). The sonar controlling module is tasked to control acoustic communication module, Doppler sonar, side-looking sonar, and other sonars, while communication computer is tasked to act as an interface between various onboard subsystems.OCEANS '95. MTS/IEEE. Challenges of Our Changing Global Environment. Conference The sonar control module is also tasked to process the imagery data, compress the data, and communicate with the communication computer. Numerous sensors were installed on board Explorer AUV to provide the necessary information for the AUV to operate, and these environmental subsystems consisted of underwater cameras and sonar. Information gathered is recorded on board the AUV while is also passed to the operator console on the mother ship at the same time, and the camera is capable of store 250 high resolution photos. The information gathered for navigation is also used to control the AUV, and extensive built-in diagnostic system can automatically fix minor problems, and alert the mother ship of major mishaps that cannot be fixed automatically, while directing the AUV to ascend to surface at the same time. The success of Explorer AUV provide the foundation for Chinese cooperation with Russia to jointly develop the next Chinese AUV, the WZODA AUV.

New technologies and design features adopted by 702nd Institute and agreed by Russian partners included the contra- rotating tunnel thrusters, which provides advantage for the AUV to climb underwater slopes. After a single unit was completed, the joint Sino-Russo team moved on the next design, CR-01 AUV. CR-01 AUV CR-01 AUV is the successor of WZODA AUV, which is also developed by the same developers, the joint Sino-Russo team that included the Chinese 702nd Institute and SIoA. CR-01 can dive to the same depth of its predecessor WZODA AUV, but with better positioning accuracy, thanks to GPS assisted navigation system incorporated. CR-01 has multiple microprocessors and reprogrammable, and in addition to be autonomous, it can also be remotely piloted via an eight-channel data link.CR-01 AUV The black box of CR-01 is based on that of aircraft, and in emergency situations such as loss of control, CR-01 would automatically surface and release markers, light and radio signals for easy salvage. Specifications: *Length: 4.374 m *Width: 0.8 m *Draft: 0.93 m *Weight: 1305.15 kg *Maximum depth: 6000 m *Maximum speed: 2 kt *Endurance: 10 hr *Positioning accuracy: 10 to 15 m CR-01A AUV CR-01A AUV is the development of CR-01 AUV. After successful deployments, it was recommended that CR-01 should be modified to solve the shortcomings exposed during its usage. After extensive refit that lasted more than one and half a year, it re-entered service as CR-01A. The external dimensions are general similar to that of its predecessor CR-01, but CR-02 can also perform salvage functions, with detection ability to penetrate mud layer up to 50 meters thick. Due to the success of CR-01 series AUV, its general designer Feng Xisheng (Â∞ÅÈî°Áõõ, December 17, 1941‚Äî‚Äî) was promoted to academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1999. CR-02 AUV CR-02 is the development of CR-01A, and it has been deployed in oceanic mineral survey. In addition to the survey sonar, a total of eight miniature obstacle avoidance sonars are installed on CR-02 AUV.

The most significant improvement of Submerged Dragon 1 AUV over its predecessors is that all previous Chinese AUV could not be directly retrieved by the mother ship. All previous AUVs can only be released from their mother ships, but not be retrieved. To recover AUV of earlier designs, small boats carrying the crew must be first released from the mother ship to approach the surfaced AUV, and then crew had to connect the recovery attachment to the AUV, and only such operations are successful completed, then the AUV could be retrieved by the mother ship. Such requirement not only increased cost, but has also limited the efficiency because such recovery operation can only be performed under clam sea. Submerged Dragon 1 solved this problem by incorporating automated recovery system on the mother ship so that AUV can be directly retrieved. Submerged Dragon 1 AUV is equipped with obstacle avoidance sonar, high resolution side scan sonar, and other scientific equipment.

Unlike previous Chinese AUVs that are fully autonomous, Arctic ARV can be operated in both fully autonomous or remotely piloted mode. The fully autonomous mode is used for large area scan, while remotely piloted mode is used for small area of a particular spot when needed. Remotely operated mode is achieved via fiber optic cable connection, and Arctic ARV can hover over particular spot if required. Arctic ARV (ÂåóÊûÅ ARV) has been deployed on Xuƒõ L√≥ng and used in arctic explorations numerous times. Unlike earlier Chinese AUVs all of which adopted a cylindrical body, Arctic ARV is box-shaped, with draft greater than width, and there are tunnel thrusters at both ends of the ARV for better maneuverability.

He was executed for his part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and is considered one of the 13 Martyrs of Arad. Ancestry V√©csey family coat of arms His father, General August von V√©csey The V√©csey family originated from Ugocsa and Aba√∫j counties, tracing its ancestry there back to the 15th century. The family took the name of the village of its first known ancestors at Hern√°dv√©cse, Aba√∫j. Bal√°zs Sz≈ëll≈ësi de V√©cse born in 1470. The family's wealth grew immensely when S√°ndor V√©csey married M√°ria Cs√°py de Poly√°nka around 1517, whose family had Hungarian royal ties. On November 21, 1692 Lip√≥t L√°szl√≥ V√©csey married and forged two branches of the family; the G√∂m√∂r and V√°rad branches, which lasted through the 19th century. The family thrived in this time and created a long tradition of military service. Along the G√∂m√∂r line, Siegbert V√©csey, K√°roly's grandfather, was born in 1789, and was eventually appointed to the Military Order of Maria Theresa and became a lieutenant- general in the Imperial army. His son, Count √Ågoston V√©csey was a cavalry commander and also admitted into the Order of Maria Theresa, and was the last commander of the Viennese Hungarian Noble Guard before it was disbanded. His wife, K√°roly V√©csey's mother, Amalia Colson died in 1826. From this marriage the following children were born: *M√°ria (1805‚Äì1875) *K√°roly *Angelika (1808‚Äì1885) *Ede (1810‚Äì1856), Imperial and royal chamberlain. In 1848 he was commander of the 2nd Imperial infantry. In July, he fought against Serbian rebels. He retired a lieutenant colonel and died in Dresden. He was married to the Countess Mary Blankenstein. *Jen≈ë (1811‚Äì1866) Imperial and royal chamberlain, Captain in the Imperial Hussars. *S√°ndor (1812‚Äì1855) Jak H√≥dmez√µv√°s√°rhely parish priest and abbot *√Ågoston (1813‚Äì1879) imperial and royal chamberlain *Karolina (1817‚Äì1898) *Em√≠lia (1818‚Äì1819) *Am√°lia (1820‚Äì1892) *Jozefina (1821‚Äì1861) *Adolf (1824‚Äì?) *Fel√≠cia (1826‚Äì1883) Karoly V√©csey married his wife Carolina Duffaud on August 15, 1849. She gave birth to a stillborn child soon after. V√©csey's confession at Arad began as follows: \\"My name is Count K√°roly V√©csey, I was born in Pest, Hungary, I am forty-two years old, Catholic, married, no children.\\" However, birth records at Budapest make no mention of him during this time. This confession also contradicted his enrolment form at the Military Engineering Academy of Vienna which stated: \\"V√©csey, K√°roly. Born 24 Nov 1803 in Russland zu Retsniow.\\" It was therefore refuted that he was born in Pest.V√©csey Lengyelorsz√°gban sz√ºletett Mer√©nyi- Metzger G√°bor, Polonia Wƒôgierska Life=Early life There is little known about his childhood. Although it is known that he spent his summers at the family estate, V√©csey Castle at Solt, with his uncle, J√≥zsef V√©csey, in G√∂m√∂r County. He spoke little Hungarian at first since both his parents had other primary languages. V√©csey therefore likely did not fully identify as Hungarian at this time. However this probably did not last long, growing up in a Hungarian dynasty. He followed the family tradition of choosing a military career and soon enrolled at the Empire's most prestigious military academy. Military career In 1820 he enlisted as a cadet in the 4th Imperial Dragoons. In 1821 he was promoted to lieutenant and was transferred to the 5th Hussars. By 1845 he was a major in the 5th Hussars. He served as the commander of the King of Hanover's Imperial Hussar Regiment in the mid 1840s under Colonel Ern≈ë Kiss, both of whom were also future martyred along with V√©csey. The regiment became one of the most distinguished in the Imperial Army and had the largest number of officers later join the rebellion. In the spring of 1848 the regiment was stationed in Nagybecskerek (today: Zrenjanin, Serbia).Gyula Kedves: A szabads√°gharc hadserege ‚Äì I. A lovass√°g, Budapest, 1992, Hungarian Revolution=Campaign against the Serbs At the onset of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, there was a large campaign to the south against the Serbians. The Austrians had promised the Serbians, along with other ethnic groups, various rewards if they fought against the Hungarian revolution. V√©csey did not particularly distinguish himself in this campaign, but, as Seb≈ë Vukovics recalled, was \\"without notable actions, but sufficiently fulfilled his duty\\". As a result of his success he was promoted to Colonel on October 12, 1848. Ern≈ë Kiss then took command of his former regiment and he took command of an army brigade. On December 15 he became a division commander and was promoted to Major General on December 12. The 2nd Hussars were then commanded by Major Guszt√°v Pik√©thy as temporary regimental commander.G√°bor Bona: T√°bornokok √©s t√∂rzstisztek a szabads√°gharcban 1848‚Äì49, Zr√≠nyi Katonai Kiad√≥, Budapest, 1983, , 230. o. At the beginning of January 1849, the government decided to withdraw forces from Baƒçka (B√°cska) and Banat to concentrate strength closer to Debrecen, the provisional Hungarian capital at Tisza. There was a morale crisis as the soldiers were unsure of their ability to face imperial soldiers rather than Serb rebels. The Verb√°sz B√°cska Corps officers held a meeting led by Count S√°ndor Esterh√°zy stated that the Emperor would not likely break his oath and have Imperial soldiers fight against each other. The situation threatened to break up the corps through a coup until V√©csey, Colonel J√°nos Lenkey and J√≥zsef Baudisz took action. As a result of Esterh√°zy Maj and about forty officers left, but the majority of the troops remained in the Hungarian army convoy. The military crisis was only overcome by the fact that the revolution depended on the solidarity of the army. Lajos Kossuth wrote cordial letters V√©csey to thank the courageous action of the officers to the official government gazette. Second battle of Szolnok Second Battle of Szolnok by Than M√≥r After the departure of Esterhazy on January 17 he took over the command of the corps for the Backa evacuation and joined up with the main army. Elements of the army's strength had been left at Szeged, thus the half-strength battalion arrived on February 12 at Torokszentmiklos, where it was stationed for the next two weeks. The standing army under the command of John Damjanich also sent substantial reinforcements to Major General Bem in the Transylvania theatre. Henryk Dembi≈Ñski, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of all forces, organized a counter-attack using the two main divisions, aimed at the Szolnok bridgehead while diverting Windisch-Gratz's attention elsewhere. Dembi≈Ñski planned to destroy any strategic holdings including a chapel, but the orders did not follow through, leading to the battled for the bridgehead on March 2. V√©csey's division attacked Szolnok, diverting Leopold Karger Maj's brigade while Damjanich's Division crossed the Tisza, onto the Imperial side. However, due to a delay in the attack the encirclement failed completely. The commanders reconvened and planned for another assault to take the bridgehead. The second battle for the bridge occurred on the 5th and resulted in a decisive Hungarian victory. For his role in the Szolnok victory he received the Hungarian Order of Military Merit III class.Hermann R√≥bert: Az 1848‚Äì1849-es szabads√°gharc nagy csat√°i, Zr√≠nyi Kiad√≥, 2004, , Dupla adag p√°linka √©s a h≈ësiess√©g. A szolnoki √ºtk√∂zet, 1949. m√°rcius 5., 185‚Äì190. o. After this battle Vecsey was made a general, causing General Damjanich to complain. The complaint turned into a serious quarrel between the two generals and they refused to cooperate. The dispute almost resulted in sedition and reflected the shortcomings of Hungarian higher command. While Vecsey was popular among the soldiers, Damjanich had had no rivals before Vecsey's promotion. Lajos Kossuth Tiszaf√ºred reported to the Chamber of Deputies on March 9 of the outcome: \\" General V√©csey nobly resigned his authority ‚Ä¶ and given total command to Damjanich. \\" V√©csey handed his two divisions over and formed a corps under the command of Damjanich in which Vecsey would serve as his second in command.Nemesk√ºrty Istv√°n: 1848‚Äì49. \\"Kik √©rted haltak szent vil√°gszabads√°g\\", Debrecen, 1977, , 284. o. Siege of Arad Bust of Vecsey at the Budapest museum On April 7, 1849 he was appointed to command the Sun Corps at the Siege of Arad castle. Initially the new position was not a fitting one, as he had little technical knowledge for siege tactics as a cavalry commander. However he eventually was able to implement his exceptional organizational skills better than his predecessors and improve the situation. The defenses were reorganized and the siege guns were well kept, with an influx of supplies from Timi»ôoara. He also managed to slow the efforts of Major General Johann Berger to blockade the Maros river canal into the fort. However, by March 25, Berger had blocked it off, negating any further supplies reaching the fort. The castle's fate was ultimately decided by this, as it was only a matter of time before the defenses would fall. With supplies being exhausted by mid-July negotiations for a surrender began. However, despite this setback, eventually the siege was relieved and the Imperial troops were defeated. The Imperial troops retreated, bypassing Vecsey's command, who sent Lieutenant Colonel Francis with a brigade to block the retreat. Commander Bem, however, cancelled this order and called the brigade back, arguing that he had authority over the unit. A disagreement followed and Vecsey claimed on April 23 that his authority and command as a general had been unjustly violated. Lugosr√≥l wrote a letter to the Government explaining the situation. In a strongly worded letter, Sandor Petofi Bem expressed his beliefs that was published in a newspaper in Cluj. Although the government resolved the case, Vecsey demanded the military courts examine Bem's statements for accuracy. The situation was rescued by Kossuth, who organized a compromise in which both commanders maintained their respective commands and Vecsey was awarded a second Hungarian Order of Military Merit award. The Hungarian leadership was critical of Vecsey in their opinion, believing him to be temperamental and misusing of his military talent. Nicholas Perczel Kossuth wrote in a letter that during the siege of Arad, V√©csey was \\" very much shooting out uselessly\\". However, his subordinates, both officers and soldiers, spoke very highly of him; both of his strategic knowledge and of his treatment of the men. He was particularly popular among the enlisted men, as he did his best to make sure they were equally equipped and provided for as the top officers. He also took great measures to allow for the religious practices of his men. Despite this popularity, on June 24 the Council of Ministers decided that Richard Guyon would take over command of the corps, although the officers stood beside Vecsey to prevent his replacement. Siege and Battle of Timi»ôoara Relief of Vecsey at the Keceli Military Museum After General Bem's successful campaign in Transylvania, Banat was responsible for the occupation and reconstruction of the region. The campaign began in April, the first objective being the occupation of Timi»ôoara, but it became apparent that the 9000 soldiers and 213 guns would not be enough, and so the attack was halted and resulted in a prolonged siege. Bem handed over command to Banat who then reorganized the troops. On May 12, Vecsey's troops reengaged in the theater and defeated an Imperial force near Freidorf castle. Around this point, Vecsey and his some 4400 men lacked any ability to move further due to lack of munitions and positioning. Vecsey performed well given the circumstances, but was now once again in a dire situation while under siege, with supply cut off from fresh Imperial reinforcements. The defenders could not break the blockade or drive off any detachments, and when the water supply was cut off, capitulation again became a serious option to be considered. Henryk Dembi≈Ñski, the Hungarian Supreme Commander, pressed through Timi»ôoara aiming to relieve Arad by force, but was pushed back by Imperial and Russian troops. The force retired to link up with the majority of the forces at Arad where the guns had already withdrawn to.Hermann R√≥bert: A szabads√°gharc hadt√∂rt√©nete, Budapest, 2001, , 304‚Äì305. o. On August 9, 1849 the Battle of Timi»ôoara occurred when Bem led some 4000 troops against the Imperial corps of Richard Guyon IV. Vecsey sallied forth from Arad during the engagement and joined the battle. Compared to other Hungarian units, Vecsey's unit had few casualties. Ultimately, although both sides had taken heavy losses, the effect on the smaller Hungarian force was larger and thus they were forced to withdraw from the field. Surrender at Oradea After Timi»ôoara, the retreating Hungarian army was split into two elements, one under Vecsey headed towards Lugos with the other element headed towards Kar√°nsebes. Bem planned on heading to the Transylvanian mountain ranges to continue the fight and reunite the remaining Hungarian forces. After linking up with G√∂rgey's unit, Vecsey again took a detachment of some 8000 men to cross the Maros River. Once again, the Hungarian army was split in two. General Bem parted with Vecsey with the farewell words of \\"All right, you go general; I must say the Austrians will hang you anyway!\\" After Vecsey 's army crossed the Maros River near T√≥tv√°rad, he attacked an Imperial Brigade, where his army suffered heavy losses at the hands of Austrian cavalry. The Hungarian army had already been battered and depleted of supply and could not perform well against the fresh Imperial and Russian troops. The only aim for the army and Vecsey was to surrender to the Russians first and hope to attain more favorable terms than surrendering to the Austrians. On August 19, the Hungarian commanders sent messages to the Russians with details of negotiating the surrender. Vecsey then marched straight to Oradea where he surrendered and had his soldiers lay down their weapons. Lieutenant General Nikolai Leontyin Pavlovich, the Russian adjutant, noted \\"a small Hungarian cavalry regiment arrived in Oradea [and] laid down their weapons in our presence. The scene was sad‚Ä¶ when they learned that G√∂rgey‚Äôs army had fled to the mountains to ... avoid an encounter with the Austrians. This resulted in the Oradea surrender\\".Leontyin Pavlovics Nyikolaj b√°r√≥nak az 1849. √©vi magyarorsz√°gi hadj√°rat idej√©n vezetett napl√≥ja (ford√≠totta: Rosonczy Ildik√≥), in: Katona Tam√°s (szerk.): A magyarorsz√°gi hadj√°rat, 1849. Orosz szemtan√∫k a magyar szabads√°gharcr√≥l, Budapest, 1988, , 329. o. The Sun Corps infantry laid down their arms before the Russians on August 21 at Oradea. Vecsey was placed into custody and a few days later brought to Arad and placed into Austrian custody. Trial and execution Execution of the Martyrs of Arad. Work by J√°nos Thorma. During the successful period of the Hungarian revolution, the Austrians sought the help of the Russian army. This was seen as a major blow to Imperial prestige worldwide and when it became apparent the revolution would fail, the Hungarians believed they had beaten the Austrians and only lost to the outnumbering Russian army. However, once the war was over, the humiliated Austrians had their opportunity to take revenge on the defeated Hungarians. A crackdown with harsh terms and conditions soon followed on the Hungarian troops. Nicholas I of Russia advised Franz Joseph to be lenient on the vanquished Hungarians for political reasons and to ease reconciliation. However, the decision for harsh punishment prevailed in a desire to discourage any more resistance.Bona G√°bor: A megtorl√°s √©s a magyar katonai emigr√°ci√≥, in: Bona G√°bor (szerk.): A szabads√°gharc katonai t√∂rt√©nete, Zr√≠nyi Kiad√≥, 1998, , 272‚Äì287. o. Vecsey's trial began September 3, 1849 in a military court at Arad. He was accused, along with many others, of being a ringleader of an insurgency. In his defense, Vecsey stated that \\"the Hungarian army was no insurgent army\\" stating that it was the army of a legitimate government and therefore the captured soldiers were entitled to proper military treatment. He further supported this claim by stating that the Emperor had approved the Hungarian Constitution, and had therefore endorsed the nation.G√°sp√°r Andr√°s honv√©d vez√©r≈ërnagy visszaeml√©kez√©seib≈ël, id√©zi: Hermann R√≥bert: I. Ferenc J√≥zsef √©s a megtorl√°s, Budapest, 2009, , 138. o. Vecsey had no supporters, whereas some officers had Imperial connections that were able to spare their lives. Count Gr√ºnne, an influential member of the privy council did everything in his power to make sure Vecsey and the other martyrs received punishment to the greatest extent, as his father had demanded that the rebels be treated as criminals. Vecsey was court-martialed and sentenced to death by hanging on September 21, 1849. Vecsey read often while in prison. He had no family besides his wife, whom he wrote a farewell letter for the night before his death. The sentence was carried out October 6, 1849. The execution of the martyrs became a national heroic tale of Hungary, creating many legends. It is difficult to discern truth and myth from the stories of the martyrs. It is said that when Vecsey was stepping up to the gallows, he stopped to kiss the hand of his personal enemy John Damjanich. The story was accounted in an eyewitness testimony of the monk Eustic Suly√°nszky, confessor of the Martyrs of Arad. A witness at Arad recalled: \\"Vecsey was the last one. He said nothing, he just silently watched all of his comrades die first. At the moment when V√©csey was about to hang, there was a great noise from the people. Vecsey‚Äôs straightened up and he stared with great interest at the crowd, as if expecting a miracle would arise...But then he too was dead.\\" Legacy Statue at Vecsey Castle Park As in accordance with the Imperial court, Vecsey's body, along with the others, was buried in an unmarked grave at Arad. Despite this, Franz Bott succeeded in bribing the executioner to allow most of the bodies to be moved. Vecsey's remains were moved by a widow of an Arad lawyer, Catherine Urb√°nyi Andr√°sn√© Hegyessy, who delivered it to his wife Carolina. It was moved to the Arad public cemetery at night where it was hidden in the Rosa family crypt. A year later it was transferred to a separate vault where it rested until 1916, when it was taken to the Arad Cultural Museum crypt. Then in 1974 it was moved for the last time to a tomb monument at the place of execution in commemoration.

Family He was born into a wealthy family partly of Armenian origin. His grandfather was Izs√°k Kiss who by redeeming the Saxon tithes in Transylvania made useful services to the treasury. In 1782 for this he earned for himself and his heirs two estates in Toront√°l County which after his death in 1807 went to the family.

Career After graduating from the Vienna Theresianum in 1818 he joined the Imperial army's cavalry regiment. In 1845 he was the commander of the 2. (Hannover) cavalry regiment. Under his command also served future martyrs of Arad such as J√≥zsef Nagys√°ndor and K√°roly V√©csey. In the spring of 1848 he stationed with his regiment in Nagykikinda (present-day Kikinda) thus he participated in battles against the Serb rebels. He initiated the first major victory in the southern land, capturing the Serbian camp in Perlasz (present-day Perlez) on 2 September. Before the Battle of P√°kozd, Lajos Batthy√°ny wanted him to take the leadership of the main Hungarian Army but finally it did not happen because at the military council in Sukor√≥ J√°nos M√≥ga volunteered to fight against the Croats. Kiss served only as an observer in the battle. On 12 October he was appointed as a major general and took the leadership of the Banat corps. On 12 December he was promoted to lieutenant general but after the Battle of Pancsova (present-day Panƒçevo) on 2 January, he resigned and handed over the leadership to J√°nos Damjanich on 9 January. In Debrecen he was appointed to the leader of the Army High Command. On 9 March he received the II. Class Order of Merit of the Hungarian military. Until the end of the War of Independence he substituted more occasions the Minister of Defence. After the surrender of Vil√°gos, he was captured and brought into the custody of Czarist Russia and later he was turned over to Imperial Austrian captivity. Aftermath His sentence was modified to death by firing squad instead of hanging because he did not command legions against the Imperial Austrian army (this happened with J√≥zsef Schweidel also because of the same reason). He took the first shot into his shoulder, soon after he commanded fire to the puzzled firing squad. After he was executed from a short distance. He was among the third of those four who were executed by firing squad. After the execution he was exhumed by his orderly who buried him under a pseudonym in the cemetery of Arad.

The general designer of the SJT class of ROVs is Mr. Zhu Jimao (Êú±ÁªßÊáã), a professor at SHJTU, who is also the general designer of the earlier Type 7103 DSRV. HR-01 ROUV The origin of SJT class ROUV begins with HR-01 (Hai-Ren Yi-Hao, Êµ∑‰∫∫‰∏ÄÂè∑, literal meaning: Sea Person # 1), one of the first indigenously developed ROUVs. Work begun in 1981 and the ROUV entered service in the winter of 1985. HR-01 is equipped with manipulator and underwater sensors, with a maximum operating depth of 200 meters, and in 1989, it won the 2nd place in the Science and Technology Advance Award of Chinese Academy of Science. Despite its successful application, HR-01 did not enter series production, and work was redirected to JH-01 ROUV. JH-01 ROUV The 2nd member of SJT class ROUV is JH-01 ROUV, developed by the same developer. JH-01 ROUV is a ROUV specifically designed to meet the urgent need of ROUV that is used to for underwater dam inspection and maintenance. The first customer of JH-01 is Hai He Hydraulic Works Committee, and the performance of JH-01 was satisfactory enough for more orders from different customers, including the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which deployed JH-01 for breakwater inspection and maintenance, in the same way JH-01 is used to inspect and maintain dams of reservoirs. SJT-5 ROUV SJT-5 ROUV is a micro ROUV that is used for underwater observation. Equipped with underwater color television and high power search light, it could provide clear images in water and record the images taken in recorders. Equipped with four electrically powered propellers, SJT-5 ROUV can perform complex underwater maneuvers to obtain the optimum position for observation.

The secondary application of SJT-10 is in salvage. Other application included similar works for underwater structures in the inland waterways. SJT-40 ROUV SJT-40 ROUV is a ROUV is the most capable member of SJT class ROUV, and it also the one with the deepest diving capability: up to 400 meters. SJT-40 ROUV has two manipulators and it capable of performing a variety of underwater works, and like other members of SJT class ROUV, it is in service with both the civilian and military operators. HR-02 ROUV HR-02 ROUV is a development of HR-01 ROUV based on the experience gained from later models of SJT class ROUV. The exact status HR-02 is subject to debate: while some have claimed that it is only the later production version of earlier HR-01 incorporating features of later models, others have also claimed that these improvements are significant enough to warrant its own classification instead of simply a continuation of the production of earlier HR-01.

History  Defence arrangements were signed between the UAE and France in January 1995, but it was not until 2007 that the UAE requested a French military presence within the country. This plan was formally announced in January 2008, and the base itself was inaugurated on 26 May 2009 by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  Organisation  Abu Dhabi base comprises three military camps of the French Army that harbour around 250 personnel. The base operates under ALINDIEN, the Admiral who heads the French forces in the Indian Ocean. Its operation costs, amounting to 15 to 50 million Euros, are funded by the UAE.  Naval base  The naval base is located in Port Zayed, at the end of the commerce harbour. It comprises a 300-metre long dock with a 200-metre wide area, and can host ships up to 10 metres of draught. This allows docking of all French Navy ships, save for the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The base faces the Straits of Hormuz, a position of vital economic importance. Approximately 40% of the world's oil passes through the Hormusz Strait. The naval component of the base will have 72 staff members. It will accommodate boat stops in the region and will serve as \\"the preferred support ships of the Navy in the region\\".  Air base  908th Expeditionary Air Refueling Wing conducts an aerial refuel with a French Rafale. The air component is named \\"Air base 104 Al Dhafra\\". Since 1 October 2008, three fighters have been based there. The base parcel granted to the French Air Force can harbour up to six aircraft. The land base has 3 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters currently on station in addition to 57 members of the military on staff.  Land base  A training camp was opened for the French Army, 50 km from Abu Dhabi. It is equipped to train soldiers for urban and desert operations. The land portion of the base holds 93 soldiers within. The soldiers tasked with maintaining the land portion of the base \\"will have the task to ensure the missions of education and training for fighting in urban areas and in the desert\\". In 2011, the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion moved from Djibouti to the base and was in turn replaced there by the 5th Cuirassier Regiment in 2016.

He was executed for his part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and is considered one of the 13 Martyrs of Arad. Life He began his military career in the Austrian Imperial Army in the 4th hussar regiment as a cadet, and eventually as a captain. His mentor was J√≥zsef Simonyi (known as the famous \\"Simonyi √≥bester\\"). He fought in the Napoleonic wars, there in inner Alia, and at the Battle of Paris as well. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out, he headed home from Vienna. When he returned he was reviewed by a board of judges in Hungary. His military ranking rose rapidly, first appointed to colonel, and after the battle of Schwechat where he was cited for bravery by the National Defense Committee, he was commissioned as general on 28 October 1848. On 9 May 1849 he became the commander of the Pest defense. Then after the advance of the Russian army he ordered a surrender. Death After being turned over to Austrian authorities, he pleaded for he and all others to be executed to be so by firing squad rather than hanging. This was initially denied for him and he was sentenced to death by hanging. However, at the pleas of his wife, his sentence was amended to be death by firing squad; seen as a more honourable death.

Arisztid Dessewffy (; 2 July 1802, in Cs√°k√°ny (present-day ƒåakanovce, Slovakia) ‚Äì 6 October 1849, in Arad) was a honv√©d general in the Hungarian Army. He was executed for his part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and is considered one of the 13 Martyrs of Arad. He commanded 100,000 men against Russian troops and surrendered because of the massive size of the encroaching Russian army. By doing so, he spared his men. On the night of his execution, he was said to be sleeping, with no anxiety about his impending death. He was executed around 4 AM by firing squad, along with three others. The Prince of Liechtenstein intervened at the last minute to spare the three from hanging, which was considered public humiliation. Life He was born into the wealthy Hungarian, evangelical Aba√∫j family. He graduated high school in Kassa (Ko≈°ice) and Eperjes (Pre≈°ov) and, at 18, applied to the Imperial Army 5th (Radetzky) hussar regiment cadets. Over a long period of peace after the Napoleonic wars he served in the fifth Artillery corps of miners and the fifth hussar regiment. However, he did not favor a military career, and thus in 1839 at the rank of captain, decommissioned, got married and began farming in Presov. His wife and children all died before the revolution. After the 1848 revolution broke out he entered military service again on Sept. 22, as a major in the National Guard and was involved in organizing the Saros county militia. On November 26, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and Brigade Commander of the Upper Tisza Corps. He took part in 11 December battle and was in the engagement. On January 4 of 1849, at the battle of Kassa he was commended for his valour and perseverance in leading his troops against General Schlik with minimal losses. He participated in the reorganization of the Upper Tisza Corps and victoriously fought against the Schleicher Corps. On February 14, he was promoted to colonel. On 18 February, commanding a small cavalry force, he defeated an Imperial detachment. He distinguished himself in this battle, and the battle of the spring campaign, for which he received the Hungarian Order of Military Merit III on April 18, and on April 30 was appointed commander of the I Corps cavalry division. The Corps was present at the siege of Budapest. On June 2 he was given command of the IX Corps, and also received the appointment of major general. On 5 July, he married a second time, to Emma Szinnyei Merse. Beginning in July, he was tasked as the top cavalry commander to hinder the advance of the Russian army. The cavalry were heavily engaged in the July 20 Tura battle. became corps commander. He took part in the August 5 Sz≈ëreg battle then again in the August 9 Timi»ôoara battle. He handed over command of the army on August 16 to Colonel William Lazarus. Death Execution of the Martyrs of Arad. Work by J√°nos Thorma. After the final defeat and surrounding of the army, he had the opportunity to escape to Turkey, but one of his comrades, a Lieutenant-General, encouraged by Prince Franz von Liechtenstein, on 19 August next to Kar√°nsebes laid down their arms before the Imperial troops. They were given terms that the soldiers would be spared but the officers would be subject to military discipline. General Liechtenstein later pleaded to his comrades at the military court to spare the lives of most, but to no avail; the Arad military court sentenced him to death by hanging. However the prince was able to convince the court to execute them by firing squad, which was seen as less of an insult since it was a military death rather than a criminal one. He was executed in the second group of four in front of a firing squad. The executed were buried around the Arad castle. His body was later exhumed by his family and moved from the castle in secret. His body has been resting at the Margonyai estate since 1850. It was said that while the execution was taking place, the Austrian generals were loudly clinking their beer steins together in celebration of the Hungarian defeat. From that day, Hungarians vowed to not clink their beer glasses for 150 years. Though the time frame passed in 1999, it is still considered bad manners to clink beer glasses in Hungary.

QSZ-II submersible is developed by the 702nd Research Institute (‰∏≠ÂõΩËàπËà∂ÈáçÂ∑•ÈõÜÂõ¢ÂÖ¨Âè∏Á¨¨702Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC). Type I diving bell The origin of the QSZ-II dates back to the 1970s, when the requirement was first issued, but it was too ambitious for the Chinese industrial capability of the time to achieve. Due to the political turmoil in China during the Cultural Revolution, work did not begin until 1980. When work finally begun, Chinese designers took a practical approach by proceeding in several stages, realizing the limitations of Chinese industrial capability. The Type-I diving bell was the first stage of development. Type I diving bell, short for Type I rescue diving bell (Yi-xing Jiu-sheng Zhong, IÂûãÊïëÁîüÈíü), is used mainly for submarine rescue, and it is also capable of being used to carry out some underwater work. For rescue operations, it is primarily used for wet rescue, but when the sea is calm and the submarine on the bottom is not tilted too much, a Type I diving bell can be used for dry rescue operations by docking and mating with the submarine. The Type I diving bell was first completed in 1985, and five years later after extensive trials and civilian service, it entered the service with the PLAN. It is capable of functioning at a depth of 130 meters and up to 8 (usually 6) submariners can be rescued on each dive. QSZ-I ADS Experience gained in the development of the Type I diving bell had greatly helped the development of QSZ-I, and this second stage of development began before the completion of the Type I diving bell. Development of QSZ-I atmospheric diving suit (ADS) took four years, from 1982 to 1986, and unlike its predecessor, the QSZ-1 ADS was immediately accepted into service on completion in 1987. QSZ-I has a tether management system (TMS). Specifications: *Length: 2.08 meter *Width: 1.3 meter *Height: 1.5 meter *Weight: 609 kg *Maximum depth: 300 meters QSZ-II submersible QSZ-II submersible is the development of QSZ-I ADS. There are three major upgrades over the original QSZ-I. The first upgrade is the addition of four thrusters and additional sensors such as underwater television, which enables the diver to operate to an extended range with radius up to 50 meters. The control system and computerization was upgraded to enable to diver to move more agilely and easily with the added equipment. The third upgrade is that in addition to being used as a manned atmospheric diving suit, it can also be used as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROUV). The maximum operational depth of QSZ-II submersible is identical to its predecessor QSZ-I ADS, at 300 meters. The general designer of QSZ-II submersible is Xu Huangnan (ÂæêËäëÂçó), a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Mobile diving bell Mobile diving bell (Yi-dong-shi Jiu-Sheng- Zhong, ÁßªÂä®ÂºèÊïëÁîüÈíü) is the latest development of QSZ series. It is an upgrade of Type I diving bell using the experience gained from the QSZ-II submersible. The skirt of the bell is modified so that it can dock and mate with the submarine hatch when the submarine is tilted at a greater angle. The addition of a propulsion system enables the bell to perform a rescue mission in fast flowing ocean currents and it can perform both wet rescue and dry rescue. Tests of the mobile diving bell have been completed in Qingdao and it subsequently entered service with the PLAN.

He was executed for his part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and is considered one of the 13 Martyrs of Arad. According to historian G√°bor B√≥na, he was from a family of Hungarian nobility of Armenian descent. Life Born into an Armenian-Hungarian noble family, L√°z√°r began his military career in 1834 when he entered the service of the 34th infantry of the Imperial army. Emperor Ferdinand I commissioned him as a second lieutenant in the Hussar regiment, but in 1844 he retired from a military career and returned with his wife, Baroness M√°ria Revitzky to his estate farm in Zempl√©n. In 1847 he was the main cashier of the railway company. As a result of the 1848 uprising, he volunteered his service into the Hungarian honv√©d army. He became a lieutenant of the 39. Gy≈ër battalions on 19 October, and on 13 November he became the captain of the pioneer battalion. He participated in the organization of the pioneer staff and in January 1849 he served in the battalion of M√≥r Perczel. From 1 February on, he served in the rank of major as an adjutant of general Mih√°ly R√©p√°sy. Representing the general, he participated in the assembly of Tiszaf√ºred on 3 March where G√∂rgei forced Dembi≈Ñski to resign. On 5 April L√°z√°r was appointed as commander of a brigade stationed in Zempl√©n. His unit was responsible for securing the country's boundary with Galicia. At the end of the month the brigade was reassigned to the legion forming in Kassa (present-day Ko≈°ice), Upper Hungary and he was promoted to a higher position. In the middle of June he became the commander of a division in the legion, which participated in the Dukla Pass battle's rearguard actions against a Russian Tsarist Army between 17-19 June. On 16 July he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and fought in the last battles of the war of independence. On 12 August, General Bem promoted him to colonel and instructed him to command IX. legion formed from the remainder of the Upper Hungarian corps. After the defeat L√°z√°r led his troops to Lugos (present-day Lugoj), near Kar√°nsebes (present-day Caransebe»ô). He split from Arisztid Dessewffy and headed towards H√°tszeg (present-day Ha»õeg), but on 19 August along with the remainder of his legion (4,600 people) he had to lay down arms in front of the imperial troops. Death Although L√°z√°r only attained the rank of colonel, as a separate corps commander in the War of Independence he was considered to have equal status with the generals in the Arad military court martial. He was sentenced to execution by firing squad, seen as merciful in comparison to death by hanging. He was among the first group executed. His bones were uncovered in 1913 at the Arad fortress cemetery. His body was then laid to rest in the crypt with a monument to him as a martyr. His wife was Baroness M√°ria Revitzky, a widow with three children from her first husband, J√≥szef Halasy de D√©vav√°nya (1784‚Äì1844).

Biography Sigrid grew up in a home hospitable to artists and intellectuals of her time, and she developed an independent spirit early in her life, refusing among other things to be confirmed in the Church of Norway. She earned her examen artium in 1911 and then took up studies in vocal music in Kristiania, Bayreuth, and Paris. She had her performance debut in 1918 in Oslo. However, she developed a respiratory ailment that made a singing career impossible. She married Diderich Lund in 1923. They had two children; the younger, Erik, had Down syndrome. She started her humanitarian efforts in 1927 while she lived with her family in Odda. There she protested against what she perceived as unacceptable class differences. After she visited Germany in 1934, she joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in 1935. She was also moved to start efforts on behalf of refugees. She became active with Nansenhjelpen and continued her efforts in occupied Norway during World War II. At the same time, she also started her efforts on behalf of children with special needs. In the fall of 1939, she traveled to Prague to bring 37 Jewish children to Norway to save them from the Holocaust. She became active in the Jewish Children's Home in Oslo and played a central role in their rescue in 1942. Already a committed pacifist, she became involved with the Quakers during the war. In February 1944, she had to flee Norway to Sweden, where she was made captain in charge of welfare services for Norwegians who had been repatriated from Nazi concentration camps. She continued this work after the war, extending her work to the merchant marine. She also held the first chair of Save the Children in Norway.

Later much of the area taken in this initial campaign (including Beeroth) was given to Benjamin as inheritance in Joshua 18.

Early life and career He was born in Gloucestershire, the son of Thomas White, a journeyman weaver. He received his earliest education in one of the Gloucester charity schools, and started life in his father's employment. Wealthy neighbours enabled him to pursue his studies at Ruscomb and Gloucester, and with support from John Moore he entered Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner on 6 June 1765. In September of that year he became scholar of his college, where he shortly afterwards obtained the Hody exhibition for Hebrew, as well as other prizes. He was fellow from 1771 until 1788, and filled various college offices. He graduated B.A. on 5 April 1769, M.A. on 19 February 1773, B.D. on 17 May 1779, and D.D. on 17 December 1787. At his patron's desire he devoted himself to the study of Syriac, Arabic, and Persian, and in 1775, by a unanimous vote, was elected to the Laudian chair of Arabic. At the suggestion of Robert Lowth the delegates of the Clarendon Press entrusted to White the task of completing and issuing an edition of the Philoxenian version (more accurately, Harklensian) of the New Testament, for which Glocester Ridley had left materials, from two manuscripts which he had brought from the east. White's edition appeared in 1778. From 1780 to 1783 he was occupied in preparing an edition of the Persian text of the 'Institutes of Timur,' of which a specimen was issued in the former year, while the whole appeared in 1783, at the expense of the East India Company. The text was accompanied by a translation into English by Major Davy, then Persian secretary to the governor-general of Bengal. The Bampton Lectures In 1783 White, one of the preachers at Whitehall Chapel, was appointed to the recently founded Bampton lectureship for 1784, his subject being a comparison between Islam and Christianity. He asked Samuel Badcock, an impoverished clergyman and newspaper writer, to write up one lecture and large portions of others, as a secret arrangement. The lectures were very well received, and White received preferment: the rectory of Melton, Suffolk, through Moore's influence, and then a prebend at Gloucester Cathedral, through Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow. Badcock then died, and White, in his letter of condolence to his sister, requested her to return all letters in Badcock's papers; but Miss Badcock took advice from Robert Burd Gabriel, to whom her brother had been curate. Among the papers was a bond for ¬£500. White at first refused to pay, but afterwards agreed. Gabriel had meanwhile circulated the story, and being challenged from several quarters to produce evidence for his assertion, at length published a number of White's letters to Badcock, evidence of the joint authorship, and also suggesting that yet other hands had been employed on the discourses. Gabriel's pamphlet ran through several editions; in a rejoinder from one of White's partisans Gabriel was virulently attacked. White in 1790 published an account of his literary obligations, maintaining that the bond was for help in a projected history of Egypt, of which work on Abd-el-latif was to be the first part. Later career Between 1790 and 1800 he published little. In the latter year his edition of Abdullatif at last appeared, with a dedication to Sir William Scott.The most likely dedicatee would seem to be William Scott, 1st Baron Stowell (knighted 1788). Abdullatif does not seem to be available online; inspection of a physical copy may be needed to make sure. He had printed the text sixteen years before, but, not being satisfied with it, had presented the copies to Heinrich Paulus who issued the work in Germany. White's edition embodied a translation which had been begun by Edward Pococke the Younger, but was completed by White himself. The elaborate monograph on Pompey's Pillar which White published in 1804 became antiquated in the light of advances in Egyptology. The rest of White's literary work was concentrated on the textual study of the Old and New Testaments, and earned him in 1804 the regius professorship of Hebrew at Oxford, carrying with it a canonry of Christ Church, Oxford. Besides various pamphlets, in which he advocated a retranslation of the Bible, and proposed a new edition of the Septuagint, to be based on the Hexaplar-Syriac manuscript then recently discovered at Milan, he published in 1800 a Diatessaron or Harmony of the Gospels. His edition of the New Testament in Greek (1st edit. 1808; often reprinted) popularised Johann Jakob Griesbach's Critical Studies. His last work, Criseos Griesbachianae in Novum Testamentum Synopsis (1811) contains a summary of the more important results. Both as a theologian and as a critic he was most conservative. White died at Christ Church, Oxford, on 23 May 1814. He married, in 1790, Mary Turner, sister of Samuel Turner who visited Tibet as a British envoy. She died in 1811.

It was amended by the Buganda Agreement of 1955 and Buganda Agreement of 1961.  Background  Prior to 1894, the local African political entities consisted of either chieftainships or kingdoms. The area that came to be known as Uganda was inhabited by many ethnic groups with distinct languages, cultures, traditions, and socio-political systems, the Kingdom of Buganda being the most powerful political entity in the region.Griffiths, Tudor. ‚ÄúBishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94.‚Äù Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 31, no. 1, 2001, pp. 92‚Äì114.

The first direct contact between Uganda and the outside world came with the arrival of Arab Muslim traders from Zanzibar in 1884.Isabirye, Stephen, and Victoria L. Enders. ‚ÄúAgrarian Relations and Conflict in Early and Middle Colonial Uganda, 1900-1945.‚Äù ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 1996. Web. In 1877, the first missionaries from the Anglican Church of England arrived in Buganda, followed by the Roman Catholics two years later. It was notable that the British colonial officials entered Uganda through a centralized kingdom rather than through a succession of disconnected societies, as they had elsewhere in eastern Africa. Their arrival in Buganda was complicated by the presence of Catholic and Protestant missionaries and the ensuing Buganda succession war of 1888-1892.Twaddle, Michael. ‚ÄúThe Bakungu Chiefs of Buganda under British Colonial Rule, 1900‚Äì1930.‚Äù The Journal of African History, vol. 10, no. 2, 1969, pp. 309‚Äì322., doi:10.1017/S0021853700009543. This religious-inspired civil war coincided with the imperial ambitions of Britain, which was trying to secure Uganda as its colony because of its importance with regard to access to the Nile. During the war, British colonial officials, following chief agent Captain Frederick Lugard of the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC), lent their support to the Protestant faction led by chief minister (Katikiro) Apollo Kagwa. Soon, the IBEAC relinquished its control over Uganda after the wars had driven it into bankruptcy. At the request of Sir Gerald Portal, Alfred Tucker, Bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa and later Bishop of Uganda, urged the British authorities to take over Uganda. On May 29, 1893, a treaty between Portal and Kabaka Mwanga informally ensured Uganda as a British Protectorate. On August 27, 1894, Mwanga was compelled to sign another treaty with Colonel H.E. Colvile, who encouraged conventional takeover of the territory. Though the 1893 and 1894 treaties had been undertaken because, as stipulated by the Berlin Conference, Uganda happened to fall within the British sphere of influence, Britain lacked the sanctity of traditional rulers and their peoples. It was important that an agreement, as opposed to a treaty, be undertaken so that British rule would become de jure as opposed to being de facto.  Agreement  The agreement was negotiated by Alfred Tucker, Bishop of Uganda, and signed by, among others, Buganda's Katikiro Apollo Kagwa, on the behalf of the Kabaka (Daudi Cwa II), who was at that time an infant, and Sir Harry Johnston on the behalf of the British colonial government. Apolo Kagwa (right) with his secretary Ham Mukasa, 1902 Buganda would henceforth be a province of the Protectorate, and would be transformed into a constitutional monarchy with the power of the Lukiiko (advisory council) greatly enhanced and the role of the Kabaka reduced. The British also gained the right to veto future choices of the Kabaka, and control of numerous other appointments. These provisions concerning the roles of the Kabaka and Lukiiko were largely reversed by the Buganda Agreement of 1961. Sir Harry Johnston The agreement stated that the Kabaka should exercise direct rule over the natives of Buganda administering justice through the Lukiiko and his officials.Morris, H. F. ‚ÄúTwo Early Surveys of Native Courts in Uganda.‚Äù Journal of African Law 11.3 (1967): 159‚Äì174. Web. It also solidified the power of the largely Protestant Bakungu client-chiefs, led by Kagwa. The British sent only a few officials to administer the country, relying primarily on the Bakungu chiefs. For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe to the Buganda capital. By the 1920s the British administrators were more confident, and had less need for military or administrative support. By fixing the northern boundary of Buganda as the River Kafu, the agreement formalized Colvile's 1894 promise that Buganda would receive certain territories in exchange for their support against the Bunyoro. Two of the 'lost counties' (Buyaga and Bugangaizi) were returned to the Bunyoro following the Ugandan lost counties referendum of 1964.  Treaty Key Points  Unlike the 1893 and 1894 treaties, the 1900 Agreement included clear boundaries of the Buganda kingdom, a land tenure system, and taxation policies. Articles: # Outlines the boundaries of the Kingdom of Uganda, # The Kabaka and chiefs renounce any claims to tribute on the adjoining provinces of the Protectorate in favor of the Her Majesty's Government; # The Kingdom in the administration of the Uganda Protectorate holds equal ranking with any other provinces of the Protectorate; # The revenue of the Kingdom will be merged with the general revenue of the Uganda Protectorate; # The laws made by the Her Majesty's Government for the Uganda Protectorate will be equally applicable to the Kingdom, except when they are in conflict with the Agreement, in which case the Agreement will constitute a special exception; # So long as the Kabaka, chiefs, and natives conform to the laws instituted by Her Majesty's Government, the Kabaka of Uganda will be recognized as the native ruler of the province; # The Namasole Chua (mother of the present Kabaka), will be paid ≈Å50 a year that may not be continued to the mothers of other Kabakas; # All cases where natives and non-natives are concerned are subject to British courts only; # Establishes administrative counties; # The Kabaka of Uganda may appoint three native Officers of State; # Defines how the Lukiiko will be constituted; # Establishes a taxation system; # Nothing in the Agreement can be used to invalidate the preexisting right of the Kabaka to call upon every able-bodied male for military service, but the Kabaka may only exercise this power under the advice of Her Majesty's principal representative; # All main public roads will be maintained in good repair by the chief of the Saza (county) through which the road runs; # Establishes how the land of Uganda is to be distributed; # The natives of Uganda may not have rights to the forests, but the Baganda may obtain timber for building and firewood; # The rights to all minerals found on private estates belong to the owners of these estates. On the land outside these estates, the mineral rights belong to the Uganda Administration; # The Kabaka, Regents, Katikiro, and Regents will be given a sum of money in return for the cession of the right of control over 10,550 square miles of land; # Her Majesty's Government will pay the Mohammedan Uganda Chief, Mbogo, a pension of ≈Å250 a year, on the condition that he cedes all rights to Her Majesty's Government # If the Kingdom fails to pay the Administration during the first two years after signing the Agreement, Her Majesty's Government will no longer be bound by the Agreement. If the revenue collected exceeds ≈Å45,000 a year, the Kabaka and chiefs may appeal for an increase in the subsidy given to the Kabaka; # The phrase 'Uganda Administration' denotes the general government of the Uganda Protectorate. 'Her Majesty's representative' denotes the Commissioner, Higher Commissioner, Governor, or principal official; # The English text is the version which is binding on both parties.  Consequences  In 1935, Sir Philip Mitchell came to Uganda as governor after serving in Tanganyika for the previous sixteen years. He was convinced that the relationship between Uganda and the protecting power should be of a character different from that between the native authorities and the Government of Tanganyika.Morris, H. F. ‚ÄúSir Philip Mitchell and ‚ÄòProtected Rule‚Äô in Buganda.‚Äù The Journal of African History 13.2 (1972): 305‚Äì323. Web. Recognizing that early Protectorate officials had produced a pattern of increasing suspicion and surreptitious changes, Mitchell devised a plan for the reform and remodeling of the system between the Protectorate and Buganda Governments.Apter, David E. The Political Kingdom in Uganda: a Study of Bureaucratic Nationalism. Frank Cass, 1997. Maintaining that the relationship between the Protectorate Government and the Native Government of Buganda was that of protected rather than indirect rule, he planned to substitute the post of Provincial Commissioner of Buganda with a Resident and to withdraw district officers from the center, assuming that the Kabaka would be obliged to follow advice given to him by the Resident and his staff. Under the 1900 Agreement, however, the Kabaka was only required to act upon such advice in the case of the implementation of Lukiiko resolutions. Relations between the Kabaka, the Protectorate Government, and his Ministers deteriorated, and because of the Governor‚Äôs restricted power under the 1900 Agreement to impose his advice upon the Kabaka, the reorganization resulted in a steady decline in the influence that the Protectorate Government could exert in Buganda.

Gruss Institute in Jerusalem. He is a noted scholar, author and teacher who has taught thousands of students throughout his over 55+ years of teaching. He spent four years studying under Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and remained very close to him afterwards. Biography Rabbi Rakeffet attended Bnei Akiva as a youth. Meir Kahane was one of his madrichim (counselors). Rabbi Rakeffet met his future wife Malkah while giving a shiur at Bnei Akiva. Rabbi Rakeffet started his career in 1961 as a pulpit rabbi at Lower Merion Synagogue in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. In 1962, he moved from Lower Merion to become the spiritual leader of the first Orthodox synagogue in suburban Essex County, Congregation Beth Ephraim of Maplewood and South Orange, New Jersey. During that time, he also served as a high school rebbe at Yeshiva University High School for Boys. In 1969, he moved to Israel and worked as a Staff Editor for the Encyclopaedia Judaica.Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 1, p.24 He also wrote numerous entries, including the one for Rabbi Joseph Dov SoloveitchikEncyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 15, pp.133‚Äì134. [A.Ro] at the end of the article represents Aaron Rothkoff, as listed in Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 1, p.41. and Rabbi Eliezer Silver.Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 14, pp.1544‚Äì1545. Upon the conclusion of the Encyclopaedia Judaica project, Rabbi Rakeffet pursued his love of teaching. He was a pioneer in Torah education for diaspora students in Israel. He was a member of the initial 1969 faculty of Jerusalem Torah College (BMT) and taught there for twenty years. He also taught at Machon Gold and Michlalah. He was also a founding faculty member at Midreshet Moriah, an advanced Torah study program for women. Rabbi Rakeffet has been a member of the Gruss Kollel faculty since its inception in 1976.Per interview with Rabbi Rakeffet by Noah Cheses, December 2009. He also recruited Dr. Nechama Leibowitz to teach there as well. Rabbi Rakeffet served in the Israel Defense Forces until the maximum allowable age. He served in Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War. In 1980, he was recruited by Aryeh Kroll to join the Mossad's clandestine Nativ operation to teach Torah in the Soviet Union. Rabbi Rakeffet visited the Soviet Union in 1981, 1985, and 1989 together with his wife Malkah, and recruited 200 others to also visit. His initial visit motivated him to help found the Shvut Ami organization. After the Iron Curtain fell, Rabbi Rakeffet followed his daughter into focusing on a new cause, the International Coalition of Missing Israeli Soldiers. At first, he spoke at fund-raising events. He soon became close with the Baumels and participated in evaluating the various leads they had. Unfortunately, no tangible outcome was realized. He then conceived the idea of using the standards for permitting agunot to marry for these cases. If the evidence indicated that the soldiers were no longer alive, the families might realize a sense of closure and the Israeli government might more easily negotiate with the enemies who held the bodies. Rabbi Rakeffet's idea was accepted by the Israel Defense Forces. In 2001, he formed a beit din which was given the necessary clearance to analyze all available evidence. After 2.5 years, the beit din concluded the soldiers had died. Rabbi Rakeffet's halakhic innovation of \\"Presumed Dead; Place of Burial Unknown\\" (◊û◊ß◊ú'◊ü), is currently used by the IDF to declare a missing soldier \\"Presumed Dead\\" in similar cases. Rabbi Rakeffet felt strongly that a documentary should be made about Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. After much effort, he found Ethan Isenberg to produce the film, and a donor to subsidize it. The documentary \\"The Lonely Man of Faith: The Life and Legacy of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik\\" was first shown in November 2006. Rabbi Rakeffet finished his 10-year effort of writing his personal scholarly memoir, \\"From Washington Avenue to Washington Street\\", with its publication in 2011. Published by the OU Press in conjunction with Gefen Publishing House. It was his seventh published volume. One critic hailed the memoirs: \\"Although serious to the core, his wonderful sense of humor shines in this inspiring life story of a true intellectual who continues to devote his talents to the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\\" In June 2016, Rakafot Aharon Vol 3 was published by Shvut Ami. Rabbi Dr. Yaakov S. Weinstein of East Brunswick, NJ compiled and annotated it based on contemporary Halachic topics presented by Rabbi Rakeffet between 1998 ‚Äì 2002 in his advanced shiurim given at YU's Gruss Kollel. The topics include: The classic Agunah, Mamzerut and Artificial Insemination. In July 2019, Rakafot Aharon Vol 4 was published, also by Shvut Ami. The first section on Hilkhot Kiddushin was compiled by Rabbi Dr. Weinstein, based on Rabbi Rakeffet's shiurim. The second section on the Russian Saga consists of material on Rabbi and Mrs. Rakffet's visits to the Soviet Union while working for the Mossad during the 1980s. The third section includes a portion of Rakeffet's published scholarship since 1993. The fourth section contains unique documents and pictures, including the identification of every student in a famous picture of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik's 1960 classroom.

Klein,Paul L. Klein-Variety Paul Klein obituary, The New York Times who was greatly influenced by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media.  \\"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\\"  In an article \\"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch\\" (published in TV Guide in 1971Klein, P. (July 24, 1971). Why you watch what you watch when you watch. TV Guide, 6-9.), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of television rather than television shows, treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast. This is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to \\"watch television\\", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find \\"something they like\\" - because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like - but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel. (Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later as unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.) Thus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, \\"disturbing their reverie\\" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, clich√©, \\"instantly familiar,\\" predictable, and monotonous in tone.  Obsolescence of the theory  It has been widely suggested that the theory itself is obsolete thanks to high quality shows, top-rated options and viewers' choice of shows whether live or time-shifted alongside the advancements of DVDs and Netflix.As More Networks Develop Series, Is There Too Much TV?-TV Guide  Notes  Further reading  *Lorrie Faith Cranor, Shane M.

The church was allegedly \\"rebuilt\\" in the 20th century, but it is more likely that the roof and some of the stonework had just been repaired. Surrounding Surp Sarkis is a small cemetery of medieval graves, and just below the church in the ravine is a spring and cave. Gallery Image:S.

In 2011, it was announced that the University of Wales would also be merged into Trinity Saint David. On 1 August 2013 the university merged with Swansea Metropolitan University. The Patron of the university is the Prince of Wales, the President of Trinity Saint David is R. Brinley Jones and the Vice-Chancellor is Medwin Hughes.  History  The University of Wales Trinity Saint David was formed in July 2010 by the merger of the University of Wales, Lampeter and Trinity University College, via a supplementary charter to Lampeter's 1828 royal charter.BBC News Report (22 July 2009); College merger sealed by royal charter.

As a direct result, in December 2008, Lampeter announced that it was in merger talks with Trinity with the intention of forming a new university. This was formally announced in April 2009, when the institution's new name, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, was revealed. The university received its first students in September 2010. The name of the institution is a combination of Lampeter's original name (Saint David's College) and the name of Trinity University College. In June 2010, a declaration of intent was announced between Trinity Saint David, Swansea Metropolitan University and three regional further education colleges (Coleg Ceredigion, Coleg Sir Benfro and Coleg Sir G√¢r) to establish a South-West Wales regional post-16 further education and higher education educational group.Press Releases (3 June 2010): A New Vision to Transform Education in South West Wales; University of Wales, Lampeter; accessed 5 July 2010 The FE colleges were to merge into one educational group, whilst the HE institutions would merge into another educational group, with both working closely within the region. In December 2010 it was announced that the university would merge with Swansea Metropolitan University. This merger was completed on 1 August 2013. In May 2011 the university announced it would be establishing the Wales International Academy of Voice in Cardiff, opening in June 2011. In October 2011, it was announced that the University of Wales would also be merged into Trinity Saint David.University of Wales effectively abolished in merger ‚Äì BBC News, 21 October 2011 A deed of union signed in 2017 functionally integrated the two universities, although the full constitutional merger has not been completed as of September 2018. A London campus was opened in 2012. In August 2012, it was announced that Coleg Sir G√¢r, a further education college with five campuses across Carmarthenshire, would be merged with Trinity Saint David, forming a combined higher education and further education institution. In 2015, the university established a second centre in Cardiff with the launch of Canolfan Berfformio Cymru (the Wales Centre for Performance). In 2016, Coleg Ceredigion, another further education college with campuses in Cardigan and Aberystwyth, merged with the university. The university opened a \\"learning centre\\" in Birmingham in 2018, offering level 4 (first year undergraduate) courses leading to a Certificate of Higher Education. In 2020 the university entered a strategic alliance with the University of South Wales through a Deed of Association. A joint statement said that the two universities would be \\"working together on a national mission to strengthen Wales‚Äô innovation capacity, supporting economic regeneration and the renewal of its communities\\", while retaining their autonomy and distinct identities.  Campuses = Lampeter The Lampeter campus includes a number of academic, utility and residential buildings. St David's Building Charles Robert Cockerell designed the original college building, now called the Saint David's Building (informally known as Old Building or OB by students) in the centre of the grounds. It is a Grade II* listed building and contains lecture rooms, administrative offices, student residential accommodation and the following three main areas: The Old Hall was the college dining hall until the Lloyd Thomas refectory was opened in 1969. It then became part of the students' union, used as a venue for meetings and dances. After the opening of a new students' union building, it fell into disuse until 1991 when it was re-opened after much restoration; it is now used as one of the university's principal venues for meetings, dinners and conferences and is often hired out to outside organisations. It is also used for examinations and occasional lectures. The Old Hall also contains paintings of various principals, presidents, benefactors, vice-chancellors et al. including the founder of the University Bishop Thomas Burgess, Maurice Jones, Thomas Price, Llewelyn Lewellin, Edward Harold Browne, Keith Robbins and Brian Robert Morris. St David's Chapel was consecrated in 1827. In 1879, it was rebuilt according to the specifications of the architect Thomas Graham Jackson of Cambridge and re-opened on 24 June 1880. It was again refurbished during the 1930s, mainly through the provision of a new reredos (incorporating depictions of St David, Christ and St Deiniol in 1933 and a major overhaul of the organ in 1934. The chapel is provided with a dedicated chaplain and services are held here on Sundays and throughout the week as well as on saints' days and major festivals. These are generally well- attended by a mixture of staff, students and alumni. The original Canterbury Building (1887‚Äì1971) The Founders' Library, named after its founders ‚Äî Thomas Burgess, Thomas Bowdler and Thomas Phillips ‚Äî was the College's library until the new library opened in 1966. It later housed the extremely rich collection of the university's oldest printed books (1470‚Äì1850) and manuscripts (from the 13th century onwards), as well as the university's archives. In 2005, it was announced that a new ¬£700,000 extension, the Roderic Bowen Library & Archives, was to be built adjoining the Main Library to house the university's special collections; the Founders' Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable and fragile documents. This extension to the main library was completed and opened in 2008. The former Founders' Library was subsequently refurbished and was reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales to provide outside conference and seminar facilities. = Later additions = The second Canterbury Building (1973‚Äì2012). The Canterbury Building was built to house a growing number of students at the end of the 19th century. The foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1885 and the building was officially opened on 24 June 1887. It contained a physical science laboratory, two lecture rooms and new accommodation. However, structural problems forced the university to demolish the original building in the summer of 1971. The second Canterbury Building was opened on 20 October 1973 by the Vice- Chancellor of the University of Kent and at various times housed the History, Classics, Foundation, Welsh and English departments. The second Canterbury Building was demolished during 2012, and the third Canterbury Building, opened during the 2012/13 academic year, now houses the Student Services Hub.http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/theuniversity/investing9millionpoundsinyouruniversity/developmentsonthelampetercampus/ \\"Developments on the Lampeter Campus\\" The Learning Resources Centre/Main Library entrance. The Library was opened on 7 July 1966 by the then Chancellor of the University of Wales, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was extended and then reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales on 21 June 1984. The Arts Building was built to house the geography department and was opened by Peter Thomas, Secretary of State for Wales on 4 October 1971. Currently, the Arts Building houses the School of Archaeology, History and Anthropology and the School of Management, VSS, IT, Business and Tourism as well as the Department of Philosophy. The Cliff Tucker Building The Cliff Tucker building, on the banks of the River Dulas, was opened by Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1996 on the site of the former archaeology practice trenches and incorporates several teaching rooms and a lecture theatre. It is named in honour of Cliff Tucker, a former student and benefactor of the university. The Sheikh Khalifa building, in the town opposite the campus. Completed in 1997 and named after Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a benefactor of the UWL, the Sheikh Khalifa building is the home of the School of Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies, one of the largest Schools of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was opened by Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland. Behind the departmental building is a small mosque and prayer room, used by Islamic students and residents of the town, and also the Rowland Williams Research building. Opened in 2007, the Confucius Institute is the home of the university's department of Chinese Studies. The mission of the Confucius Institute has been to build bridges between Wales and China. The Roderic Bowen Library & Archives were completed in 2007, adjoining the main library building. They are named after Roderic Bowen, a former President of the university. The books, manuscripts and archives kept therein were formerly held in the St David's Building Founders' Library. The library was opened on 17 October 2008 by the former First Minister for Wales, Rhodri Morgan. It is a resource for teaching, research and scholarship within the university and for the wider academic community. The Students' Union houses the university's main entertainment venue, the Xtension, a bar, television and pool rooms, student shop and offices for union officials. It is the main focus of social life on campus, hosting club nights, socials, pool tournaments and charity events. The Bishop Burgess Hall formerly housed the Departments of Classics and Philosophy. In 2009 it was converted to become a hub for student services.  Gallery  Image:St David building inside.JPGInside the cloisters of Saint David's Building.

Image:Students Union Lampeter.JPGThe Students' Union building (Ty Ceredig) containing the Old Bar  Carmarthen  Old College, Carmarthen Although its foundation and indeed its speciality lies in education, the campus now also teaches a variety of degrees in subjects such as sport, health and nutrition, religious and Islamic studies, psychology, social inclusion, creative arts, photography, film and drama, business and tourism, and English and creative writing. The Carmarthen campus is the base of two of the university's three faculties. The campus is centred around the original 1848 Old Building of Trinity College. It originally contained all of the original dormitories, common rooms, libraries, an original university quadrangle and teaching spaces. The building today houses several lecture theatres and smaller classrooms often used by the university's School of Justice and Social Inclusion (including psychology) and theology, religious studies and Islamic studies. Another feature of the old building of Carmarthen is the Archbishop Childs' Hall. Named after Derrick Greenslade Childs, who was Archbishop of Wales, Bishop of Monmouth and director of the Church of Wales. Childs was principal of Trinity in 1965. The hall is of a classical shape and is hung with framed paintings of Childs. On the outside of the building, there is a carved crest of the Bishops of Wales. Cwad ‚Äì The original 1848 quadrangle, what later became the old college library has been modified into the 'Cwad'. This operates in partnership with the main library. Attached to the main body of the Old Building is the University Chapel. This was built in 1848 and although it has been modified slightly, still retains many original features. Attached to this is the historic ante-chapel, the original chapel the present one being an extension added in 1932, which is dedicated to past students and professors who served in the first world war. The ante-chapel contains a font and is decorated with student artwork. There is also the university chapel lounge which now houses the university's chaplaincy library and serves as a comfortable, relaxed meeting space for the Chapel community. This room also has a stained glass window installed in 2008 in memory of Norah Isaac, former lecturer and pioneer of Welsh language education. The Swansea-based Faculty of Business and Management has three units (Camarthen Business School; Sport, Health and Outdoor Education: Carmarthen; Wales Institute for Work-based Learning) on the Carmarthen campus. = Later additions = The surrounding campus is a blend of modern buildings surrounded by sweeping lawns and gardens. Opposite the old building is the Halliwell Centre, named after a former principal of Trinity College, Thomas Halliwell, which is primarily used as a conference facility. Attached to the centre is the Merlin restaurant which is the campus' main restaurant and refectory for catered students. Halliwell Building, Carmarthen The Carwyn James Building is a large four-storey building named after Carwyn James, a former Welsh rugby player, teacher and lecturer at Trinity College. This facility is home to the Faculty of Education and Training. Emyr Wyn Jones Building- This building contains office space, music suites and practice rooms for the School of Performing Arts. Adjoining this building was the School's main workshop for the degree of theatre production and design. The Dewi Building was originally built in 1925 as the Dewi Hostel. It was an extension of the original old college and served as an extra wing for student accommodation. An account of the conditions of the hostel survives from a student living in them at the time; \\"To keep oneself warm in the new wing during the Winter months was a problem for although it had a system of heating, the heat seldom reached even the second floor. To wash we depended on the rain-water caught in the roof of the building and this was always cold\\". The main library of the university campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate the growing diversity of subjects on the campus and is located opposite the Parry Block. It is dedicated to the poet Raymond Garlick, who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh department. The Parry Building, named after Albert William Parry (a former principal of the college and psychology lecturer 1909‚Äì1940), contains a variety of teaching facilities used largely by the university's School of Creative Arts. These include fairly large classrooms and smaller art studios. The building runs parallel to the Norah Isaac building and the two are of very similar designs. Originally the front fa√ßade of the building, the oldest part, was the broadcast room in 1950. Students' Union ‚Äì The students' union building was the centre of student social life on the campus. Constructed in 1972 it comprised two main venues: the Attic Bar which served food and drinks and downstairs 'Unity', the main entertainment venue of the Union. This facility hosted club nights as well as other social events. The Union incorporated many societies, ranging from sports such as rugby and hockey to historical societies. Norah Isaac Building ‚Äì This building is home to the school of social justice and Inclusion and contains the reception for that school. It is named after Norah Isaac, who was responsible for setting up the first ever Welsh drama department, and was a founder of the performing arts tradition at Trinity. It has a selection of classrooms and lecture suites. Degrees in English and Creative Writing are also taught in this building, which is also home to the university's foreign office, which deals with international programmes. It is located directly opposite the Parry Building. Robert Hunter Building ‚Äì Named after Robert Hunter, this building contains a selection of classrooms, lecture halls and laboratories used by the school of sport, health and outdoor education. The facility is located near the Myrddin Accommodation blocks, and is surrounded by picturesque gardens and ponds. Dafydd Rowlands Building ‚Äì Named after the author Dafydd Rowlands, a minister and previous lecturer of Trinity College in the Welsh department, the building is home to the university's department of Film and Visual Media, this space contains laboratories and studios as well as several working spaces for other programmes within the school of creative arts. It also houses office space.  Swansea  Alexandra Road campus (1890s) UWTSD took over the campuses of Swansea Metropolitan University upon the merger of the two institutions. These now make up part of the Swansea city centre campuses of the university, consisting of the Dynevor campus, the Mount Pleasant campus, the Alex Design Exchange, and the Swansea Business Campus (including the Swansea Business School). The current Swansea Business School building was a part of Swansea Metropolitan University from its formation in 1897 as the Swansea Technical College. In 2018 the university opened a new ¬£350 million campus at the SA1 Swansea Waterfront, housing Yr Athrofa: the Institute of Education, and the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering. Staff and students from the city centre Townhill and Mount Pleasant campuses relocatec to SA1, with Townhill closing at the end of the 2017-18 academic year although the university has retained a presence at Mount Pleasant.  Other campuses  London = The university's London Campus opened in 2012, originally in Islington, and moved to its current location in Winchester House on Cranmer Road in Lambeth in 2013. The campus offers a variety of BA, MA, MBA and DBA courses in various business and management fields, as well as a BSc in cloud computing. = Birmingham= UWTSD opened its Birmingham Learning Centre in March 2018. It is based on Stratford Road in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham. The centre offers BA courses management fields. = Cardiff= The university has two learning centres in Cardiff: the Wales International Academy of Voice and the Canolfan Berfformio Cymru (Wales Centre for Performance). Partners The university is a part of what has been called a dual-sector university, delivering both higher and further education. It has franchise or validation partnerships with a number of other further and higher education institutions across the UK, including: * Coleg Sir G√¢r (constituent college) * Coleg Ceredigion (constituent college) * Glasgow Academy Musical Theatre Arts * Gower College Swansea * Hereford College of Arts * Lerna Ltd * London School of Commerce (associate college) ‚Äì Teaching-out as of March 2020, with no new admissions onto UWTSD-validated courses * NPTC Group * Newbold College of Higher Education * Pembrokeshire College * The Prince's Foundation: School of Traditional Arts * St Padarn's Institute In addition to these, the university has a joint award MSc/EdD programme with Bangor University.

Academic profile=Reputation The university was the first in the UK to place at its core sustainable development. The university's Institute of Sustainable Practice and Resource Effectiveness or INSPIRE is designed to ensure that students are prepared for their futures in the workplace and in society as a whole. Entry requirements With many of the degrees offered by the university there is less emphasis placed upon UCAS points and more upon individual merit especially regarding mature students. However, for many of the degrees offered within the Faculty of Humanities a set number of UCAS points is required; for most courses this is usually between 240‚Äì280. For postgraduate taught programs a minimum of an upper second class degree is required.  Research  The university has continued the tradition of research in the humanities at Lampeter. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF2014), 47% of the university's research was judged as world leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). The university entered six units of assessment in REF2014, with 26% of research being judged 4* and 39% 3* in Modern Languages and Linguistics (jointly with the University of Wales's Centre for Advanced Celtic Studies), 23% 4* and 52% 3* in Art and Design: History Practice and Theory (jointly with the University of South Wales and Cardiff Metropolitan University as the Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design), 14% 4* and 48% 3* in Theology and Religious Studies, 9% 4* and 25% 3* in Geography, Environmental Studies and Archaeology, 4% 4* and 38% 3* in Classics, and 3% 3* in General Engineering. The pioneering Sophia Centre for the Study of Cosmology in Culture is a world centre for the study of the impact, role and function of cosmological, astronomical and astrological beliefs and practices in human culture.  Student life =Students' union Logo of the Trinity Saint David Students' Union Students are represented by Trinity Saint David Students' Union (TSDSU). The students union has buildings on all three main campuses, with bars in Carmarthen (Taphouse72) and Lampeter (Old Bar & Xtention).  Sports  Both Lampeter and Carmarthen campuses have sports halls with badminton and squash courts, with a hockey team drawing from students of both campuses and a fencing team based on the St David's College campus which regularly competes in Welsh leagues and championships. Both campuses also have indoor climbing walls. For outdoor sports, the university has tennis courts, a cricket field and facilities for football and rugby. The Carmarthen Campus also has an indoor swimming pool, an up-to-date gym and fitness suite and AstroTurf. There plans in motion to add gym facilities to Lampeter through the conversion of one of the squash courts. The college cricket pavilion at Lampeter was opened officially on 1 May 1909 and is now a listed building in its own right. = Rugby = Rugby was introduced to the old St David's College by vice-principal Rowland Williams around 1850 and, as such, the Lampeter campus can claim to have the oldest Rugby football team in Wales. Despite some debate as to whether this honour belongs to the town team or the university side, the Welsh Rugby Union's official history \\"Fields of Praise: The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union, 1881‚Äì1981\\"Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881‚Äì1981 pp259, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) indicates the college team as the first. However, Lampeter Town RFC were the representatives of Lampeter at the formation of the WRU in 1881. At Trinity, Rugby has long been an important part of college life. Indeed, a number of alumni went on to become outstanding international players including Sid Judd, Ronnie Boon, Dewi Bebb and Barry John. Wales and British Lions winger, Gerald Davies, is a former student of both former universities.  Halls of residence  Both Carmarthen and Lampeter campuses provide on-campus halls of residence, although some students opt to live in privately rented student housing within the respective towns. Both campuses can house approximately 600 students. = Lampeter Campus = The university provides various residences for students. The Lampeter Campus is generally able to house the majority of its students on campus principally within the following Halls and Buildings, named after personalities involved with the campus's past. *Carl Lofmark Hall *Cyfle Hall *Bishop Burgess Hall (originally ordinands-only) *Daniel Dawson Hall *Dolwen Cottage *Edwin Morris Hall *Garth House *Harford Building I & II (originally female-only)Russell-Jones, Ruth (2007); A History of the Lampeter Society 1937‚Äì2007; Lampeter: University of Wales, Lampeter; pp. 21‚Äì22 *Harold Arthur Harris Hall *Hugh Walker Hall *John Richards Hall I & II *Lloyd Thomas Hall I, II & III *Rhoslwyn Hall *Riverside Cottage *Roderic Bowen Hall *Simon Evans Hall *St David's Building/Old Building (originally male-only) = Carmarthen Campus = The Carmarthen Campus is able to house hundreds of students on Campus, though many students opt to live in the town.

There are over 300 rooms for first year students to apply for. = Townhill Campus = *Gwyr Hall *Dyfed Hall *Cenydd Hall  Academic dress  Until 2014, the university awarded University of Wales degrees and, as such, the academic dress was that of the University of Wales: bachelors wore a black gown with bell sleeves and a black simple shape hood, masters wore a black gown with glove sleeves and a black full shape hood, and doctors wore a crimson gown with a crimson full shape hood. Hoods (and doctoral gowns) were lined with colours indicating the faculty, e.g. mazarin blue shot green for arts, mazarin blue shot red for theology or divinity, and bronze (yellow shot black) for science. Since July 2014, UWTSD has awarded its own degrees. However, the academic dress used for the UWTSD degrees has not changed from that used for University of Wales degrees.

The problem is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person or machine, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. The activity selection problem is also known as the Interval scheduling maximization problem (ISMP), which is a special type of the more general Interval Scheduling problem. A classic application of this problem is in scheduling a room for multiple competing events, each having its own time requirements (start and end time), and many more arise within the framework of operations research. Formal definition Assume there exist n activities with each of them being represented by a start time si and finish time fi. Two activities i and j are said to be non-conflicting if si ‚â• fj or sj ‚â• fi. The activity selection problem consists in finding the maximal solution set (S) of non-conflicting activities, or more precisely there must exist no solution set S' such that S' > S in the case that multiple maximal solutions have equal sizes. Optimal solution The activity selection problem is notable in that using a greedy algorithm to find a solution will always result in an optimal solution. A pseudocode sketch of the iterative version of the algorithm and a proof of the optimality of its result are included below. Algorithm Greedy- Iterative-Activity-Selector(A, s, f): Sort A by finish times stored in S = {A[1]} k = 1 n = A.length for i = 2 to n: if s[i] ‚â• f[k]: S = S U {A[i]} k = i return S = Explanation = Line 1: This algorithm is called Greedy- Iterative-Activity-Selector, because it is first of all a greedy algorithm, and then it is iterative. There's also a recursive version of this greedy algorithm. *A is an array containing the activities. * s is an array containing the start times of the activities in A. * f is an array containing the finish times of the activities in A. Note that these arrays are indexed starting from 1 up to the length of the corresponding array. Line 3: Sorts in increasing order of finish times the array of activities A by using the finish times stored in the array f. This operation can be done in O(n \\\\cdot \\\\log_2 n) time, using for example merge sort, heap sort, or quick sort algorithms. Line 4: Creates a set S to store the selected activities, and initialises it with the activity A[1] that has the earliest finish time. Line 5: Creates a variable k that keeps track of the index of the last selected activity. Line 9: Starts iterating from the second element of that array A up to its last element. Lines 10,11: If the start time s[i] of the ith activity (A[i]) is greater or equal to the finish time f[k] of the last selected activity (A[k]), then A[i] is compatible to the selected activities in the set S, and thus it can be added to S. Line 12: The index of the last selected activity is updated to the just added activity A[i]. Proof of optimality Let S = {1, 2, \\\\ldots , n} be the set of activities ordered by finish time. Assume that A\\\\subseteq S is an optimal solution, also ordered by finish time; and that the index of the first activity in A is k eq 1, i.e., this optimal solution does not start with the greedy choice. We will show that B = (A \\\\setminus {k}) \\\\cup {1}, which begins with the greedy choice (activity 1), is another optimal solution. Since f_1 \\\\leq f_k, and the activities in A are disjoint by definition, the activities in B are also disjoint. Since B has the same number of activities as A, that is, A = B, B is also optimal. Once the greedy choice is made, the problem reduces to finding an optimal solution for the subproblem. If A is an optimal solution to the original problem S containing the greedy choice, then A^\\\\prime = A \\\\setminus {1} is an optimal solution to the activity-selection problem S' = {i \\\\in S: s_i \\\\geq f_1}. Why? If this were not the case, pick a solution B‚Ä≤ to S‚Ä≤ with more activities than A‚Ä≤ containing the greedy choice for S‚Ä≤. Then, adding 1 to B‚Ä≤ would yield a feasible solution B to S with more activities than A, contradicting the optimality. Weighted activity selection problem The generalized version of the activity selection problem involves selecting an optimal set of non- overlapping activities such that the total weight is maximized. Unlike the unweighted version, there is no greedy solution to the weighted activity selection problem. However, a dynamic programming solution can readily be formed using the following approach:Dynamic Programming with introduction to Weighted Activity Selection Consider an optimal solution containing activity . We now have non-overlapping activities on the left and right of . We can recursively find solutions for these two sets because of optimal sub- structure. As we don't know , we can try each of the activities. This approach leads to an O(n^3) solution. This can be optimized further considering that for each set of activities in (i, j), we can find the optimal solution if we had known the solution for (i, t), where is the last non-overlapping interval with in (i, j). This yields an O(n^2) solution. This can be further optimized considering the fact that we do not need to consider all ranges (i, j) but instead just (1, j). The following algorithm thus yields an O(n \\\\log n) solution: Weighted-Activity-Selection(S): // S = list of activities sort S by finish time opt[0] = 0 // opt[j] represents optimal solution (sum of weights of selected activities) for S[1,2..,j] for i = 1 to n: t = binary search to find activity with finish time <= start time for i // if there are more than one such activities, choose the one with last finish time opt[i] = MAX(opt[i-1], opt[t] + w(i)) return opt[n] ReferencesExternal links * Activity Selection Problem Category:Scheduling algorithms Category:Articles containing proofs ","title":"Activity selection problem"},{"id":"24598721","text":"The Podlaska Cavalry Brigade (Polish: Podlaska Brygada Kawalerii) was a military unit of the Polish Army, created on April 1, 1937.

In the evening of September 9, the Brigade engaged in heavy fighting, trying to recapture the town of Brok, with its bridge over the Bug River. The Poles managed to capture eastern part of the town, but then their advance was stopped. On September 11, the Brigade withdrew towards Zambr√≥w, next day it joined forces with Suwalska Cavalry Brigade, creating the so-called 'Group' of General Zygmunt Podhorski: \\"Zaza Cavalry 'Division'\\" (\\"Zaza\\" after \\"Zygmunt\\").

From the summit of Slide Mountain, Lake Tahoe, Washoe Lake, Carson Valley, and the city of Reno can be viewed. Slide Mountain is named after the repeated large landslides that occur high on the mountain's south east side. The slide areas are devoid of trees and vegetation and are covered in granite rock and decomposed granite sand. This gives the barren slopes a whitish color, and the distinctive slide zones are plainly visible from points to the southeast of the mountain in Washoe Valley. The most recent large slide occurred on May 30, 1983. The slide ran immediately into Price Lake in a small valley halfway down the mountain. The resulting slurry of granite sand, granite rock, and forest debris flowed freely down the canyon below Price Lake, and ran out on the flat floor of Washoe Valley. The debris flow severed the older US 395 highway, and partially covered the newer US 395 freeway. The slide destroyed several homes, killed one person, and injured several others. The volume of water flushed out of Price Lake was estimated to be 7 million gallons. The debris flow in the canyon was measured as 30 feet high at the bottom of the canyon, and the rock fall volume was estimated to be 1.4 million cubic yards. Slide Mountain dominates the Reno skyline, standing above the city just to the south of its larger neighbor Mount Rose. Several ski trails and a maintenance road lead to the summit, making the hike to the top an easy one, especially from the Mount Rose Summit Campground located on State Route 431 at the Northwest base. The \\"Mount Rose Ski Tahoe\\" resort is located on Slide mountain. This leads some to believe that the mountain itself is named Mount Rose, but Mount Rose is actually approximately higher and several miles to the northwest. Many communications towers adorn the summit, providing television, radio, emergency responder and amateur communications service to the Reno, Carson City and Lake Tahoe areas.

It crosses the district of Gifhorn from north to south and discharges into the Aller at Gifhorn itself.  Course  The source of the Ise lies at a height of above sea level and its mouth at . Its slope of 0.05% is very gentle. The waters of the Ise flow via the Aller and Weser into the North Sea. The Ise is formed west of Neuekrug in Saxony-Anhalt, immediately on the old Inner German border with Lower Saxony, by the confluence of several small streams. In this Lower Saxony border region the river often runs dry in summer, but below the point where it is joined by the Rade ditch (Graben) its water flow is more consistent. From there the Ise flows by the villages of (a district of Wittingen), (a district of Wittingen), (a district of Obernholz), Hankensb√ºttel, Alt Isenhagen (a district of Hankensb√ºttel), (a district of Wittingen), Sch√∂new√∂rde, Wahrenholz, Wagenhoff, Neudorf-Platendorf, (a district of Gifhorn) and (a district of Gifhorn) to Gifhorn. The river's only water level gauge () is located near Neudorf-Platendorf, from its mouth. Just before Gifhorn the Ise feeds the castle moat in Gifhorn as well as the M√ºhlensee lake, on which the Gifhorn Mill Museum stands. In Gifhorn's town centre the Ise meets the Aller, shortly after the point where it is dammed to power a mill. In older lexica, Gifhorn is characterised as an old 'marsh castle' () on the two rivers.  Catchment area  The Ise has a catchment area of . This is bisected in a north-south direction by the Elbe Lateral Canal that flows at a height of above sea level. The natural stream passes under the canal in culverts. The most important tributaries of the Ise are the Bruno, Beberbach and Knesebach; others include the Fulau, Gosebach, Isebeck, Momerbach and Riet. The catchment area of the Elbe begins east of the Ise region.  Water quality  The Lower Saxony water quality report Gew√§sserg√ºtebericht Aller/Quelle mit Ise by the Lower Saxon State Office for Waterway, Coastal and Nature Conservation of 2004 assessed chemical water pollution of the Ise as variable. The values for organic pollution, nitrate, ammonium and phosphate contamination varied from lightly polluted to critically polluted. At the J√§gerhof, a popular destination for day trippers, on the B 188 near Gifhorn there has been a testing station since 1967 where water quality is measured. The White-stem Pondweed, a species of plant that is in danger of becoming extinct in Lower Saxony, grows very luxuriantly in this particular area.  Points of interest  The Ise near Gifhorn, seen from a boat The Ise used to be maintained by the Iseverband Wasser Association in Wahrenholz but has been superseded by the Aller-Ohre-Verband in Gifhorn. There is no shipping on the river but it is well suited to canoe tours (boats may be hired near Gifhorn). In recent decades the Ise and its surrounding landscape has been discovered to be a valuable natural habitat, so that its use for nature conservation has become a top priority. In general, the river crosses wide, flat meadow country, far from habitation, in a sparsely-populated region. Shortly before its mouth in Gifhorn, near the river banks, are the Gifhorn Mill Museum and Gifhorn Castle. Several hundred metres downstream is another mill, the Cardenapsm√ºhle. This has been a watermill at least since the 27 January 1213 (when it was mentioned in a deed of donation by Otto IV) and, until its closure in 2004, was one of the oldest working mills in Europe.  Otter habitat  Water mill on the Ise at Wahrenholz The Ise near Neudorf- Platendorf The Emmer stream (Emmer-Bach), that discharges into the Ise, flows through Hankensb√ºttel, where the Otter Centre is located. The Otter Centre is a very popular tourist destination with about 100,000 visitors annually. Since 1987 they have worked on revitalising the Ise. As part of a research and development project, a lot of work has been carried out in the valley. The aim was to create a self-sustaining environment around the waterway. The leading animal species for this project was the European otter. Since 1987 the Otter Conservation Project (Aktion Fischotterschutz) has purchased around of agricultural land by the river and has converted the bulk of it into grassland. In addition, 46 km of unused river bank has been planted with alders. As part of long-term scientific work accompanying the project, its development has been documented and assessed.  Name derivatives  The old , now part of Gifhorn district, was partly named after the river and its local newspaper is the Isenhagener Kreisblatt. In the vicinity, not far from the river, is the old Isenhagen Abbey. It was used as a monastery until the Protestant Reformation and has since become a Protestant convent.  Timber rafting  In 1571 the Celle Duke, William the Younger, submitted a plan to float logs down the Ise, an activity known as timber rafting (Fl√∂√üerei). Its purpose was to convey logs from the royal forests to the ducal Residenz town of Celle, where it was needed as fuel for heating Celle Castle and other royal buildings. On the Ise north of Gifhorn were several royal forests that could have been logged. For some reason the project was not carried out. In 1617 the rafting of logs to Celle was again proposed by the officials of Knesebeck and Gifhorn to the Duke of Celle, by this time Christian the Elder. Estimates at the time put the cost of transporting logs by horse and cart at about 10 times that of rafting them down the river. These plans foundered on the rocks of the Thirty Years War which started in 1618. As a result, timber rafting down the Ise was not introduced until the reign of Duke Christian Louis. For this he called for a senior forester from Harzburg and a mine surveyor from Clausthal to advise him. In the Harz mountains they had a lot of experience with timber rafting because logs were needed for the ironworks there. Based on the recommendations of the advisors, in 1659 the river was cleared of rubbish, bushes and mud by several hundred farmers conscripted for the purpose. Extensive earthworks were created in order to get rid of the many meanders and shorten the course of the river. The canal cuts in the Ise valley left artificial ox-bows. Wooden sluices with sluice channels were built at Wahrenholz and Gifhorn. The first test run was carried out in 1659 and timber rafting officially began on the Ise in 1661 when 4,400 st√®res of wood fuel was transported to Gifhorn and from there down the Aller to Celle. To begin with 100 men were employed on the task. They freed logs that had jammed at critical points such as sluices, bends, bridges and ox-bows. Later a smaller workforce was employed. Under good conditions it took 10 days for log rafts to reach Celle, otherwise it might take up to 3 weeks. There were 10 assembly points on the Ise where the logs were tied together into rafts. The rafts of logs were about 2.5 metres wide by around 20 metres long. The logging crew comprised 2 or 3 raftsmen. Losses occurred as a result of logs sinking or being stolen en route. In Gifhorn, where the Ise enters the Aller, the logs continued to Celle. In Celle they came to rest at a needle dam and were then hauled ashore. After the death of Duke George William, in 1705, timber rafting on the Ise and Aller went into decline. When the royal household moved to Hanover, Celle lost the baroque lustre of a Residenz town. Raft dealers took over the business. Around 1880, timber rafting on the Ise finally petered out. The cause was the upgrade of tracks and roads and the construction of sawmills in the vicinity of the forests.

Later, in 1799, under the rule of Maximilian IV Joseph he would work for the new revised College for Book Censorship that Maximilian von Montgelas had founded. Westenrieder's membership in the Illuminati may have helped his selection by Von Montgelas, a fellow Illuminatus. Westenrieder was one of the voices in the intellectual movement known as the Bavarian Enlightenment. This occurred much later than the Enlightenment that had already reached its zenith in much of Europe, and would occur in a syncopated form, first under Maximilian III Joseph in the middle of the eighteenth century, and then this enlightenment would come full circle during the reign of Maximilian IV Joseph 1799-1806, ending in 1817 with Montgelas's dismissal from King Maximilian I (previously Maximilian IV Joseph). Works Lorenz von Westenrieder is better known as an author of German literature than a political figure. During his life, he wrote over thirty separate works: * Wesentliche Begriffe des praktischen Christenthums.

Of this dual representation strategy Kassan notes, ‚Äúmy effort to constantly learn to document reality with a naturalistic, representational painting technique allows for pieces to be inherent contradictions; paintings that are both real and abstract.‚ÄùKassan, David. \\"Artist Statement,\\" http://davidkassan.com/statement.php . Kassan's work is best classified as Social Documentary Painting, due to the importance and relevance of the subjects he chooses to represent. In 2014, Kassan turned his attention to painting and documenting Survivors of the Holocaust, with the development of the EDUT project )-\\"edut\\" being Hebrew for \\"living witnesses\\" as a way of connecting with his grandfather's traumatic history of escaping ethnic cleansing on the border of Romania and Ukraine to come to America in 1917. The EDUT project's mission is to meet with as many living Survivors to the Shoah as possible and to document them in filmed video portraits and in paintings and drawings. While many survivors have already told their stories on video (as in the Visual History Archive developed by the USC Shoah Foundation) or in memoirs, Kassan believes painting offers viewers a different kind of connection to the survivors, one that puts a personal face to the sometimes abstract idea of the Holocaust. In 2017, David Kassan partnered with the USC Shoah Foundation and the USC Fisher Museum of Art to develop the EDUT project into a Resilience Exhibition which will open at the Fisher Museum in the fall of 2019 in Los Angeles. Kassan is a much sought after drawing and painting instructor because of his steadfast commitment to the age old discipline of working from life and creating compelling expressions of the human condition. He has given painting/drawing seminars and lectures at various institutions, and universities around the world. In 2013, he founded the Kassan Foundation in hopes of giving grants directly to underprivileged talent in both the visual and musical arts. Kassan works can be seen in many public collections worldwide. Kassan currently lives in Albuquerque. NM. Education David Kassan received his B.F.A. in 1999 from the College of Visual and Performing Arts at Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY. He continued his studies at The National Academy, and the Art Students League of New York, both in Manhattan His Newington-Cropsey Foundation Travel Grant allowed him to study and sketch in Italy in the summer of 2003. There he conducted sketch studies of various masterworks, which are source of inspiration to his own work.Carpenter, Sandra. \\"Losing Yourself in a Drawing,\\" Artist's Sketchbook, December 2004. These experiences were recorded in a self-published book \\"Lentemente Italia\\". Work David Jon Kassan‚Äôs work has been described as \\"Raw, poignant and profoundly honest. He seeks to capture the essence of those he paints, imbuing them with their own voice. More than simply replicating his subjects Kassan seeks to understand them. We are moved by Kassan‚Äôs depictions, captivated by powerfully expressive hands, pensive faces, and flesh that appears warm to touch. Ultimately, there is a truth and timelessness to Kassan‚Äôs work because it is so deeply human. His subjects are distilled in an exact moment in time, patiently contemplating their present. We share in this present-moment appreciation, this slowing down of time, and see life for what it is.\\" Exhibitions * \\"David Jon Kassan - Recent Paintings\\", Louise and Bernard Palitz Gallery, Lubin House, New York, NY - 2005 * \\"Introspections\\" - Gallery Henoch (Chelsea), New York, NY March 12 - April 4, 2009 * \\"Process\\" - Manifest Gallery, Cincinnati, OH - March 2012 * \\"Solitudes\\" - Gallery Henoch (Chelsea), New York, NY September 13 - Oct 6, 2012 He was one of three shortlisted for the 2014 BP Portrait Award at the National Portrait Gallery, London, with his painting \\"Letter to my Mom\\". Technique Kassan has studied human anatomy extensively, reflecting a scientific understanding of the muscular structures beneath the skin. Kassan has written extensively on the subject and its relation to conveying emotion, including publishing an ‚ÄúArtist‚Äôs Guide to Portrait Anatomicae‚Äù and several articles on the topic for magazines such as Artist Daily. and a quarterly column on anatomy for Drawing Magazine Kassan‚Äôs technical mastery of oil paint combined with adept draftsmanship enables him to fluently represent what he sees. This is evident in the stunning flesh tones Kassan achieves. Transparent layers of oil paint are built up, forming an intricate lattice of veins, blood and skin. Through this light enters and is reflected back. His technique of creating layered application of pigments has been hailed by critics as creating a highly realistic impression of skin and flesh.Philips, Carol, \\"David Kassan: Reluctantly Classic,\\" Empty Magazine, November 2007 In addition to work in traditional drawing and painting media, Kassan has also explored the use of digital media, including the use of the iPad as a portable painting tablet, used for studies of masterworks in museums around the world. His YouTube demonstration \\"Finger Painting on the Apple iPad from the live model\\" now viewable at originally achieved over 1 million views within 6 months of posting.

Documentary films David Kassan has produced and filmed two Instructional Documentary films in partnership with Movette Pictures (Painting a Life) and Studio Four Cinematography (Drawing Closer to Life) * Drawing Closer to Life (2010, Studio Four Cinematography). This 3 hour DVD documents a day in David Jon Kassan's Brooklyn studio as he develops a charcoal study of Henry Williams Oelkers. David vocalizes his complete thought process and approach as he develops this drawing. The essence of this DVD is developing an understanding of how to translate and interpret what we see into drawings that capture the subtle character, emotion and insights into the model's personality. * Painting a Life (2014, Movette Pictures, http://www.movettepictures.com). In this 7-hour, two disc, instructional documentary, David weaves together his philosophies on painting as well as how he paints technically. In \\"Painting A Life\\", we get to know the subject, Jaece Lutrec. intimately‚Äîher thoughts, feelings and her life as David paints her. This film illustrates not just the step-by-step process of how David paints, but also depicts his patient search to understand the subject. To encourage a full understanding of the process, David completely vocalizes his thoughts on how to use broken color to develop lifelike skintones and how to use color temperature, value, texture and brushstrokes to turn form. Also discussed is how to train your eye to see these subtle color shifts and transitions. Included is a full discussion of David‚Äôs materials (brushes, mediums, paints, etc.), how he prepares his painting surfaces, his studio setup and lighting, how he transfers the drawing to the painting surface, a brief introduction to his drawing process, and a field trip to Vasari Classic Oils Colors to discuss of all of the paints on David‚Äôs palette and their properties and history with Gail Spiegel, Vasari's color expert. Philanthropy In 2013, Kassan founded the Kassan Foundation in hopes of giving grants directly to underprivileged talent in both the visual and musical performance arts. The aim of the Kassan Foundation is to nurture talent by offering financial support to underprivileged Visual Artists and Musicians. Each year the foundation offers two grants; one to a promising representational artist and one to a promising musician in order to boost their career and accelerate their artistic growth. The grant would assist with potential production and material costs, travel and further education.

It stars John Savage. This was the last film directed by Fulci.  Plot  New Orleans, Louisiana. While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a dilapidated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, driving a red sports car. The mystery woman suggests that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right. Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge. At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting. The folded ribbon adorning the casket seen inside the hearse bears a name tantalizingly similar to Devereux's own. The confused, now frightened man follows the hearse to a church where an all-black congregation is mourning at another funeral procession. Devereux drunkenly disrupts the proceedings, attempting to look inside the closed casket. He gets thrown out of the church by the angry parishioners. Devereux drives over to a nearby funeral home where he sees that all of the corpses in the open coffins are labeled 'Melvin Devereux'. He finds his doppelganger lying dead in one of the caskets and tries to touch it, but it disappears beneath his outreached hand. Back on the road, Devereux picks up a beautiful female hitchhiker, and tries to respond to her seductive advances, but he cannot perform, forcing her to leave the car. Next, Devereux drives onto a river barge as it transports a handful of vehicles, including the omnipresent hearse, to the other side of the river. Devereux rips open the hearse's back door and tries to open the coffin which clearly bears his name. The hearse driver intervenes and there is a struggle. Devereux is subdued by the other barge passengers and gets arrested. In a local courtroom, Devereux is given a fine for defiling the casket. Devereux drives away and soon stops to visit a tarot reader. Reading the palm of his right hand, the palmist tells him that he has been dead for several hours. She suddenly falls dead after receiving a phone call from a \\"Mr. Devereux.\\" Devereux is once more on the road, driving nowhere. He suddenly sees the hearse again on the road and tries to overtake it, only to crash head-on into an oncoming truck. Devereux is killed instantly. His wristwatch stops at 7:29 PM, the same time as the film's prologue where a briefly seen car crash had appeared to be the cause of his father's death. The mysterious woman observes the fatal accident a short distance away on the road before getting into her car and driving off. The number license place on the woman's car reads: D.E.A.T.H. At the end of the final scene, the text of a mysterious quote in Italian appears: ... Quando varcherai le porte del nulla, nessuno ti sara vicino: solo l'ombra della tua morte ... IV Libro dell'Apocalisse. English translation: ... When you go to the gates of nothingness, no one will be near you: only the shadow of your death ... Book Four of the Apocalypse. To date, it is not known who the author of this quote is, nor has any anonymous source been located.

One of the most gifted and uncompromising poets of the 1980s generation, Adam J. Sorkin described her as \\"a distinctive voice revealed from the dark night of humanity's soul.\\" Life and poetry She was brought up by her mother and her grandmother after her parents' separation, when she was three. Educated in Bucharest during the time of the Romanian relative cultural freedom of the 1960s, she went on to receive a degree in philology from the University of Bucharest in 1980, starting a grade school teacher career that lasted almost ten years, first in a village along the Danube, then in Bucharest. Her first poetry book, Un rƒÉzboi de o sutƒÉ de ani (A Hundred Year War) was published next year and won the Romanian Writers' Union Prize for a debut in poetry. In 1982 Marin appeared alongside four other '80s writers in a collective volume, Cinci (Five), under the patronage of Nicolae Manolescu, who's so-called \\"Monday Poetry Circle\\" all of them used to attend. More and more overtly opposed to the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's dictatorship, her next volume, Aripa secretƒÉ (The Secret Annex) employed a not uncommon strategy to circumvent censorship by creating a fantastic diary of, and dialogue with Anne Frank, a thinly disguised metaphor for life in the open-air camp that Romania had become into during the last years of communist rule. She was banned to publish and joined the ranks of silenced intellectual voices until the collapse of the regime in 1989. For a number of years after 1990, Marin divided her time between Paris and Bucharest. She worked at \\"Contrapunct\\", an independent spirited Romanian literary-cultural magazine, involving herself in various journalistic projects. During the decade she travelled a lot, invited to various European literary festivals. Her next book, Mutilarea artistului la tinere≈£e (The Mutilation of the Artist in his Youth) was unanimously acclaimed and won a number of major literary prizes. In the fall of 2000 she spent six months in Berlin on a writing fellowship and a year later she won the \\"Virgil Mazilescu\\" special literary prize. Navigating between enthusiasm and disappointment during those troubled years following the fall of the communism, barely making ends meet, she survived with the help of friends and aid from the Writers' Union, before descending into chronic alcoholism and developing TB. Despite her misery and ills, she kept writing. In 2002 she published a career retrospective, Zestrea de aur (The Dowry of Gold), her final book. She was married and divorced twice, she had no children. Translated * Au carrefour des grandes routes commerciales, (translated by S√©bastien Reichmann), Ed.

It was written by Mike Bullen, directed by Ciaran Donnelly, and was first broadcast on the ITV network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) travel to Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod (Gary Sweet) suspects that Pete is only marrying her to get access to his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets cold feet and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark (Sean Pertwee) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital. The episode was conceived by Mike Bullen and Cold Feets executive producer Andy Harries in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney and decided to contrive the main plot of the fourth series so the characters would end up in Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in Manchester and Salford, England. After location scouting and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in Vaucluse for the wedding scenes, Palm Beach for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the Opera House. The episode was watched by nearly nine million people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a \\"pick of the day\\". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role. The episode represented the series when it won the award for Best Drama Series at the British Academy Television Awards 2002. Plot Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) arrive in Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily arranged wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is surprised to learn that his daughter is marrying a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fianc√© Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her. Rachel, who is spending most of her time in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men in order to have a child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark. Pete and Adam make up after their row and Adam goes to Jo's to collect Pete's clothes. Her regret over her breakup with Pete leads Adam to convince Rod that he should give the wedding his blessing. He follows David to a business meeting with Rod, which David has arranged as a prelude to emigrating his family to Sydney, and with David's help changes Rod's mind about Pete. Rod later meets Jo and Pete to give them his blessing, and they reconcile. On the day of the wedding, David finally reveals his plans for the family to Karen, unaware that Mark is in the apartment. Karen is surprised that David has made the plans, including finding a house for them to live in. Mark is irritated by David's attitude and reveals the affair to him. Enraged, David lashes out at Mark and the two fight. Karen angrily tells Mark to leave. Outside the hotel, Rachel goes into premature labour. Adam rushes her to hospital, where she is taken into surgery. At the wedding venue, Pete asks David to take Adam's place as best man. As Adam has the rings, David volunteers his own wedding band to Pete, and Karen does the same for Jo. Pete and Jo exchange their wedding vows and are pronounced husband and wife. After the wedding, Karen tries to approach David but he just walks away, telling her \\"no more\\". Later, Pete, Jo and Karen join Adam and Rachel at the hospital, where they are introduced to the baby, Matthew Sydney Williams. David flies home alone in tears. Production= Writing  The episode was devised following a lecture given by writer Mike Bullen and executive producer Andy Harries at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference in November 2000.de Lisle, Rosanna (11 December 2000). \\"Manchester six go walkabout\\". The Sydney Morning Herald (Fairfax Media): p. 4 (The Guide section).Harries, Andy. (2003). Interview on bonus disc of \\"Cold Feet: The Complete Story\\" DVD [DVD]. Video Collection International. Bullen and Harries already knew that actress Fay Ripley did not want to renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted \\"for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go\\". The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1. As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, \\"One of them [the characters], whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters.\\" Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country.Courtis, Brian (26 April 2001). \\"Cold Feet steps south\\". The Age (Fairfax Media): p. 32 (Green Guide section). The direction of the fourth series, and thus the finale, changed significantly when Helen Baxendale announced that she was pregnant. Bullen wanted the episode to be an ordinary episode of Cold Feet that just happened to be set in Australia. The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as \\"prawns on the barbie\\", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue. Bullen told the Sun Herald, \\"I really wanted to go beyond 'no worries' and 'she'll be right mate'. We've asked most of the local actors to improvise with their own sayings, to make sure we get it right.\\" In 2003, Bullen recalled this episode's script as the most difficult he had ever written.Bullen, Mike (22 February 2003). \\"And they all lived happily ever after...\\". Western Mail (Western Mail & Echo): p. 4. The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing. After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the Sun Herald that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet.Sams, Christine (7 October 2001). \\"TV's coolest Brits warm their feet in Aussie sand\\". Herald Sun (The Herald and Weekly Times): p. 45. Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of Cold Feet; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would like to write a final run of episodes. Filming The episode was directed by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July.Madjarian, Annette (23 May 2001). \\"'Cold Feet' shoots in Oz\\". Encore (RBI Australia). Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place.Miller, Kylie (23 May 2002). \\"Travelling south. The Age (Fairfax Media): p. 8 (Green Guide section). This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers who had never been to Sydney would not be able to tell the difference.Campbell, Spencer. (2003). Interview on bonus disc of \\"Cold Feet: The Complete Story\\" DVD [DVD]. Video Collection International. Helen Baxendale was nearing the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and exterior scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, \\"We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. I had to look out the porthole and have a weep. As I was doing that, I looked out and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together.\\"\\"TV ONE People: Robert Bathurst\\". TVNZ. Retrieved on 9 September 2009 (archived by WebCite on 1 June 2011). Strickland House, the exterior filming location for Pete and Jo's wedding Production in Sydney commenced the week beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days. The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out along with a skeleton crew. Additional staff were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia, the Australian production arm of Granada Productions, as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Filming locations included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the Northern Beaches. The scenes of Shawn's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy's apartment. The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House, Vaucluse.Smith (2003), p. 204. Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House. While preparing for the scene, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted by a group of British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David's affair in Series 3. The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot. Karen and David's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in Milsons Point. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. The stunt co-ordinator and Pertwee, who was already experienced in stunt fighting, agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real, instead of \\"hitting air\\".Pertwee, Sean (2002). \\"Cold Feet Backstage\\" featurette on \\"Cold Feet: The Complete 4th Series\\" DVD.

In the Liverpool Echo, Rachael Tinniswood wrote that the episode \\"was a fantastic display of everything that has made Cold Feet such a popular drama over the past few years\\" and that Kimberley Joseph had proved to be \\"a more than adequate replacement\\" for Fay Ripley over the course of the fourth series.Tinniswood, Rachael (11 December 2001). \\"Thanks a million, Chris\\".

Karen pursues David as he storms off after the ceremony, shouting his name, undoubtedly ready to alternate once more between pain and partial forgiveness, as they have done throughout their marriage. David turns and says: 'No, Karen. No more'.\\" (archived on author's website). Smith also compared the scene to the wedding scene in the film The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, 1946). ITV submitted the episode to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) to represent the series in the Best Drama Series category at the British Academy Television Awards 2002.

Sub-Saharan Africa has been most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, given that of all new HIV infections in the world, those in sub-Saharan Africa account for more than two-thirds of that number, as of 2008.Message of the WHO Regional Director for Africa World Aids Campaign 2008: ‚ÄúStop Aids. Keep the Promise‚Äù (World Health Organization, Regional Office for Africa). Retrieved July 30, 2009. In helping to fight the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, AFCA provides critical antiretroviral medicine and other related medications, medical equipment and supplies, sustainable food solutions for families and institutions helping orphans, emergency supplies needed by the institutions in AFCA's targeted areas, as well as critical support for the prevention of HIV/AIDS, which included training of personnel. Currently, AFCA collaborates with twenty-eight partners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi,Uganda, and Zimbabwe. History The organization, operating under the name Global Foundation for Children with AIDS until 2005, received its 501(c)(3) status in March 2004. Its headquarters were originally located in Lawrence, KS, but were moved to Harrisburg, PA, in August 2008. AFCA's first partners were the Pediatric Infectious Disease Clinic at the Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda; St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya; and the Mombasa Community-Based Health Care and AIDS Relief Program in Mombasa, Kenya. AFCA expanded its partnerships in 2005 to include St. Joseph's Shelter of Hope Center in Voi, Kenya, later adding St. Mary's Mission Hospital and St. Theresa's Home of Hope in Elementita, Kenya, in 2007. Also in 2007, AFCA began working with a program called Zimbabwe Orphans through Extended Hands (ZOE) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. In 2008, AFCA began partnering with the Church of the Ascension in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe and in 2009, AFCA expanded its partnerships by collaborating with Tandala Hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kilembe Mines Hospital and Cooley Clinic in Uganda. In 2011, AFCA expanded its partnerships to include 16 additional clinics in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2012, AFCA added Mpumudde Clinic and Atutur Hospital in Uganda to its partner list and in 2014, AFCA created livelihoods programs in Tandala and Gemena, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2019, AFCA started work in Mzuzu, Malawi. AFCA is a member of the Children's Medical Charities of America and in May 2007, AFCA received the Best in America Seal of Excellence from the Independent Charities of America. This seal is awarded ‚Äúto the members of Independent Charities of America and Local Independent Charities of America that have, upon rigorous independent review, been able to certify, document, and demonstrate on an annual basis that they meet the highest standards of public accountability, program effectiveness, and cost effectiveness. These standards include those required by the US Government for inclusion in the Combined Federal Campaign, probably the most exclusive fund drive in the world. Of the 1,000,000 charities operating in the United States today, it is estimated that fewer than 50,000, or 5 percent, meet or exceed these standards, and, of those, fewer than 2,000 have been awarded this Seal.‚Äù Ratings and reviews AFCA meets 20 out of 20 standards from the Better Business Bureau. AFCA has earned a 4 out of 4 rating with Charity Navigator. AFCA is considered a Top-Rated Charity, earning a B+ rating from Charity Watch. AFCA is a Platinum-level GuideStar Exchange participant, demonstrating its commitment to transparency. Mission The mission of AFCA is to \\"provide critical comprehensive services to infected and affected HIV+ children and their caregivers. Our programs are efficient, promoting self-reliance and sustainability. Since 2005, in collaboration with our in-country partners, we have served tens of thousands of families in some of the most underserved and marginalized communities in Africa. Our areas of impact include: medical support, livelihoods, educational support and emergency relief.‚Äù AFCA's approach to HIV care is family oriented. In addition to providing care for HIV-infected children from ages 0 through 19, the organization provides pregnant women who are HIV positive with the antiretroviral medication required to prevent the transmission of HIV to their unborn children. This preventive care is an important aspect of the care provided by AFCA since according to UNAIDS, reversal of the global HIV epidemic will not occur unless there is a decrease in the number of new HIV infections. AFCA also provides antiretroviral and other medicines for the HIV-positive guardians of infected children to prolong the guardians‚Äô lives, thus preventing the children from becoming orphans. Believing that children and guardians in their programs should become self-reliant, AFCA provides livestock (goats, chickens, sheep, pigs, guinea fowl, and rabbits) and seeds and tools, water filters, and solar lights to families who've been affected by HIV/AIDS and who want to escape the ravages of poverty. With husbandry and gardening training and monthly follow ups, the families are able to provide for themselves and not to rely on outside help. AFCA maintains a warehouse in Lebanon, PA where medical supplies and equipment are stored, packaged, inventoried, and from where they are sent to hospitals and clinics in the countries AFCA works. Hospitals request specific supplies or equipment and AFCA delivers them to their doorstep in order to help them grow their capacity and ability to give good care to their patients, including the children AFCA serves. AFCA runs a program called Vacation with a Purpose, inviting people from all walks of life to visit their programs in Africa while building a house for AIDS orphans, painting a clinic, playing with children, working side by side with medical personnel, doing administrative tasks, gardening, and much more. This program takes teams to Democratic republic of Congo, Kenya and Zimbabwe. The main fundraiser AFCA utilizes to fulfill its mission is called Climb Up So Kids Can Grow Up. This fundraiser consists of outdoor events, which cater to individuals of any age or ability: Climb Up: Kilimanjaro, Climb Up: Nigeria, Climb Up: Nepal, Climb Up: New Zealand and Climb Up: Peru are some of the events currently supporting AFCA's work.http://www.afcaids.org/climb-up Retrieved March 24, 2015.

From the junction, a mineral line descends on a gradient of 1 in 100 to Tyne Dock Bottom. On 17 December 1915, in the early morning in fog, a goods train ran out onto the main line past St Bedes signalbox having been banked in the rear up the incline by a six-coupled tank engine. The banking engine, uncoupled, dropped away from the goods train and came to a stand on the up main line, but was not seen by the signalman. Shortly afterwards, the signalman accepted the 07:05 passenger train from South Shields to Newcastle on the up line and the 06:58 empty stock train from Hebburn to South Shields. The passenger train collided with the rear of the banking engine at 30 mph, telescoping the two leading coaches. Almost immediately the empty stock train collided with the wreckage, killing the fireman. The gas-lit passenger coaches were consumed by fire, killing 18. Causes The signalman's failure to notice that the goods train had been banked was the primary cause of the disaster. But also at fault was the driver of the banking engine who stood for 17 minutes before obeying Rule 55 and sending his fireman back to the signalbox, by which time it was too late to avert the accident. The continued use of gas-lighting also contributed to the severity of the accident and a circular was sent to all railway companies stressing the importance of replacing gas with electric lighting.

The story of Antony Kloman's life remains quite mysterious and sketchy. World War II activities Born in Haymarket, Virginia, Kloman graduated from Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland and in the 1920s is reported to have worked for the Corcoran Art Gallery in Washington as Assistant to the Director. During World War II he served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), where he was involved in the training of secret agents. From 1944 to 1945, he was posted at the US Embassy in Stockholm under the cover of Cultural Attach√©, where his assignment was to attempt to recruit and infiltrate agents into Germany. After the war he lived in New York and in London, where he allegedly was employed by Hambros Bank. Whether, once he had left Stockholm, he was still employed by any secret service is not known. Arts career Kloman was the organiser of the International Sculpture Competition on the Theme of the Unknown Political Prisoner from 1951 to 1953, held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, at which he served as the first program director. This later turned out to be financed by the U.S. State Department, via the \\"benefactor\\" John (Jock) Whitney, as a front. At the time of the competition, Kloman was married (since 1948) to Theodate (Theo) Johnson, the sister of the architect Philip Johnson, which explains his close connections to the MoMA. Franz Schulze wrote in his biography of Johnson about this relationship: \\"[... In 1953 (sic), Theodate Johnson] succumbed to the allure of Tony Kloman, a man remembered by the Johnson family as long on looks and charm, short on a commitment to any definable career. He trafficked a little in antiques, painted an occasional portrait of somebody who could afford it, and idled much of the rest of the time, content to survive on Theo's money. Their divorce was filed and settled in 1956.\\" In the late 1950s, he settled as a painter, mainly children's portraits, in Newport, Rhode Island. He died in 1993 in Manatee County, Florida.

History  In 1924, Amy Redpath Roddick donated the Roddick Gates in memory of her late husband, Sir Thomas George Roddick, a renowned doctor and dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1901 to 1908. Amy Redpath Roddick (May 16, 1868 - February 16, 1954) was the first-born child and only daughter of Ada Mills and John James Redpath. She became the second wife of Thomas Roddick on September 3, 1906. Amy Redpath Roddick commissioned Grattan D. Thompson (1895-1971) to carry out the work on the monument. In 1922, Gratton D. Thompson married Elizabeth Grace Redpath. The Roddick Gates were formally opened by Amy Redpath Roddick on May 28, 1925.

It enters the sea at Kenmare Bay on the southern side of the Iveragh Peninsula. Fisheries The fishing in the Kerry Blackwater is managed by IFI Macroom and the river receives a run of around 1500 salmon and grilse each year. It also receives a good run pf sea trout which pass through the river on their way to Logh Brin and its headwaters. Access for anglers to the river is said to be \\"excellent\\". Two boats are available for angling use on Lough Brin. Natural history and conservation A Special Area of Conservation, protects most of the basin of the Blackwater River. This is one of the areas in which the rare Kerry slug is known to occur. Other rare species which are protected by the SAC include the otter, freshwater pearl mussel, lesser horseshoe bat and Atlantic salmon. The area is of international importance for the lesser horseshoe bat, with one roost site having 150 bats counted there in 1996. The site is also recognised as being of cpnservation importance for birds, notably the peregrine falcon, merlin, red- billed chough and hen harrier. It is also home to populations of Hesperocodon hederaceus which is scarce in Ireland. Culture The area around the Kerry Blackwater is mainly farmland, especially pastures.

Operation The railway operates within the Gro√üer Garten, a large city centre park, from April to October. It is some long and attracts approximately 250 000 visitors every year. The line starts from An der Gl√§sernen Manufaktur station, which takes its name from the adjacent Gl√§serne Manufaktur, a Volkswagen car factory. From here to Zoo station the line is double track, and served by trains in both directions. Zoo station takes its name from the nearby Dresden Zoo and is the headquarters of the line, with locomotive and car sheds. Beyond Zoo station, trains normally operate on a one-way single track loop via stations at Carolasee, Karcherallee and Palaisteich, before returning to Zoo station. A shorter loop is also available that omits Karcherallee station, but this is rarely used. The park railway has four locomotives. Of these, two are nearly identical steam locomotives built in 1925, numbered 001 (Lisa) and 003 (Moritz). There are also two battery electric locomotives with EA01 built in 1962 and EA02 built in 1982. The locomotives haul 35 passenger cars and a number of ancillary vehicles. Trains are run by a team of, in 2009, 165 children together with four full-time adult employees and some 50 seasonal and part-time staff. During the winter months, the children are trained in their tasks for the forthcoming summer. History The railway was founded in 1950 as the Kindereisenbahn with only one track, long, between Zoo and St√ºbelplatz (which later became Fuƒç√≠kplatz and then later still Stra√üburger Platz). The railway was planned to only last for a year, but it was kept and renamed Pioniereisenbahn in 1951. The line was owned by Dresden City Council, but operated by the pioneer movement. In 1951 the track was extended to running from Zoo via Carolasee and Palaisteich back to Zoo. Later in the same year the station Karcherallee was opened and the line reached its current length of . In 1968 an additional track was added between Zoo and Fuƒç√≠kplatz. In 1990, after German reunification, the railway was renamed as the Parkeisenbahn. In 1993, ownership of the line was transferred to the state of Saxony. In 2000, the construction of the new Gl√§serne Manufaktur meant that the station at Stra√üburger Platz had to be relocated. The new station was opened in 2000, and subsequently renamed An der Gl√§sernen Manufaktur.

An 18th-century Georgian geographer and historian Vakhushti Bagrationi wrote that there are 365 Orthodox churches in Georgia named after Saint George, according to the number of days in one year.Gabidzashvili, Enriko. 1991. Saint George: In Ancient Georgian Literature. Armazi ‚Äì 89: Tbilisi, Georgia.F. J. Foakes-Jackson, A History of the Christian Church, Published by Cosimo, Inc., 2005, , page 556Antony Eastmond, Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia, Penn State Press, 1998, , page 119 There are indeed many churches in Georgia named after the Saint; Alaverdi Monastery is one of the largest. Devotions to the saint in Georgia date back to the 4th century. While not technically named after the saint (Sakartvelo is the Georgian name for the country), its English name is an early and well-attested back-derivation of Saint George. The terms Georgia and Georgians appeared in Western Europe in numerous early medieval annals. The French chronicler Jacques de Vitry and the English traveler Sir John Mandeville wrote that Georgians are called Georgian because they especially revere Saint George. The Georgian Orthodox Church commemorates St. George's day twice a year, on 6 May (O.C. 23 April) and 23 November. The feast day in November was instituted by St Nino of Cappadocia, who was credited with bringing Christianity to the land of Georgia in the 4th century. She was from Cappadocia, like Saint George, and was said to be his relative. This feast day is unique to Georgia, and it is the day of St George's martyrdom. coat of arms of Georgia There are also many folk traditions in Georgia that vary from Georgian Orthodox Church rules, because they portray the Saint differently from the Church, and show the veneration of Saint George by the common people of Georgia. Different regions of Georgia have different traditions, and in most folk tales Saint George is venerated very highly, almost as much as Jesus himself. In the province of Kakheti, there is an icon of St George known as White George. This image is also seen on the current Coat of Arms of Georgia. The region of Pshavi has icons known as the Cuppola St. George and Lashari St. George. The Khevsureti region has Kakhmati, Gudani, and Sanebi icons dedicated to the Saint. The Pshavs and Khevsurs during the Middle Ages used to refer to Saint George almost as much as praying to God and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Another notable icon is known as the Lomisi Saint George, which can be found in the Mtiuleti and Khevi provinces of Georgia. Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia An example of a folk tale about St. George is given by author Enriko Gabidzashvili: Some interesting tales come from Georgian sources, some of which are also attested to by Persian ones, that the Georgian Army during many battles was led by a knight on a white horse who came down from Heaven, that's why Georgia won battles with 10 times smaller army. Catholicos Besarion of Georgia also testified of this. ·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò (giorgi), the Georgian variant of name George, is historically the most popular given name for men in Georgia. England British recruitment poster from World War I, featuring St. George and the Dragon. Traces of the cult of St George predate the Norman Conquest, in 9th-century liturgy used at Durham Cathedral, in a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon martyrology, and in dedications to Saint George at Fordington, Dorset, at Thetford, Norfolk and Doncaster. He received further impetus when the Crusaders returned from the Holy Land in the 12th century. At the Battle of Antioch in 1098, St George, St Demetrius and St Maurice were said to have been seen riding alongside the crusaders, and depictions of this event can be seen in a number of churches.M.D. Anderson, History and Images in British Churches (1995, pp. 195-196) King Edward III (reigned 1327‚Äì77) was known for promoting the codes of knighthood and in 1348 founded the Order of the Garter. During his reign, George came to be recognised as the patron saint of the English monarchy; before this, Saint Edmund had been considered the patron saint of England, although his veneration had waned since the time of the Norman conquest, and his cult was partly eclipsed by that of Edward the Confessor. Edward dedicated the chapel at Windsor Castle to the soldier saint who represented the knightly values of chivalry which he so much admired, and the Garter ceremony takes place there every year. In the 16th century, Edmund Spenser included St. George (Redcross Knight) as a central figure in his epic poem The Faerie Queene. William Shakespeare firmly placed St George within the national conscience in his play Henry V, in which the English troops are rallied with the cry \\"God for Harry, England and St George,\\" and in Richard III, and King Lear. A late 17th-century ballad also claims St. George as an English patron. The ballad compares other mythic and historical heroes with the merit of St. George and concludes that all are less important than St. George. Saint George and the Dragon, tinted alabaster, English, ca 1375‚Äì1420 (National Gallery of Art, Washington) With the revival of Scottish and Welsh nationalism, there has been renewed interest within England in Saint George, whose memory had been in abeyance for many years. This is most evident in the St George's flags which now have replaced Union Flags in stadiums where English sports teams compete. Above the Palace of Westminster, there are six shields above each of the four clock faces of Big Ben, twenty-four in total, all depicting the arms of St George, representing the Flag of England, London as the capital city of England, and St. George as the patron saint of England. This symbolism is also repeated in the central lobby of the Houses of Parliament, in an enormous mosaic created by Sir Edward John Poynter in 1869, depicting St George and the Dragon with these arms &c;, entitled \\"St George for England\\".Jarrold Publishing, Norwich. Palace of Westminster Collection St George's Day is also celebrated each year in London with a day of celebration run by the Greater London Authority and the London Mayor. The UK Houses of Parliament also celebrate St George's Day each year with a reception and other events, organised by the St. George's Day All Party Parliamentary Group, including providing every MP with a red rose to wear in his/her lapel. The city of Salisbury holds an annual St George's Day pageant, the origins of which are believed to go back to the 13th century. The Order of St Michael and St George, a British order of chivalry, was founded in 1818, and partly named after the saint. Ethiopia Saint George is the patron saint of Ethiopia. Bete Giyorgis, the most important of the eleven rock-hewn monolithic churches in the town of Lalibela is dedicated to him. Saint George served as an important symbol of nationalism during the Italian invasion in the 1930s. In 1937 Emperor Haile Selassie, while in exile in England, took part in a memorial service for those killed in the Abyssinian war at St George's, Bloomsbury. Saint George is still a popular figure in contemporary culture with the country's oldest beer, Saint George's beer, and the Addis Ababa football team Saint George S.C. is named for him.

Nowadays Saint George is the patron saint of both Aragon and Catalonia, as well as the patron saint of Barcelona (see Flag of Barcelona) and other historically important Spanish towns such as C√°ceres or Alcoi (Spanish language: San Jorge, Catalan language: Sant Jordi, Aragonese language: San Chorche).Christian Roy, 2005, Traditional Festivals page 408 His feast date, 23 April, is one of the most important holidays in Catalonia, where it is traditional to give a present to the loved one; red roses for women and books for men. In Aragon it is a public holiday, celebrated as the 'National Day of Aragon'. It is also a public holiday in Castile and Leon, where the day commemorates the defeat at the Revolt of the Comuneros. =Portugal and Brazil= St. George Castle in Lisbon, Portugal Apparently, the English crusaders who helped King Afonso Henriques (1109‚Äì85) in the conquest of Lisbon in 1147 introduced a devotion to Saint George to Portugal. Nevertheless, it was not until the time of King Afonso IV (1291‚Äì1357) that the use of S√£o Jorge!! (Saint George) as a battle cry, substituted for the former Sant'Iago!! (Saint James). Nuno √Ålvares Pereira (1360‚Äì1431), Saint Constable of Portugal, considered Saint George the leader of the Portuguese victory in the battle of Aljubarrota. King John I (1357‚Äì1433) was also a devotee of the saint and was in his reign that Saint George replaced Saint James as the main patron saint of Portugal. In 1387, he ordered that its image on horse be carried in the Corpus Christi procession.Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages, By A. H. de Oliveira Marques, Vitor Andre, S. S. Wyatt Published by Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1971 page 216 As part of the Portuguese Empire, Brazil inherited the devotion to Saint George as patron saint of Portugal. In the religious traditions of the Afro-Brazilian Candombl√© and Umbanda, Ogum (as this Yoruba divinity is known in the Portuguese language) is often identified with Saint George in many regions of the country, being widely celebrated by both religions' followers. Popular devotion to Saint George is very strong in Rio de Janeiro, where the saint vies in popularity with the city's official patron Saint Sebastian, both saints' feast days being local holidays. Saint George is also the patron saint of the football club Corinthians, of S√£o Paulo. The club stadium is Parque S√£o Jorge (Saint George's Park).Robert M. Levine. Brazilian Legacies. M.E. Sharpe, 1997 page 139 Russia and Bulgaria Mural above the entrance to a church in Sozopol, Bulgaria St. George is praised by the Bulgarians as \\"liberator of captives, and defender of the poor, physician of the sick\\". For centuries he has been considered by the Bulgarians as their protector. Possibly the most celebrated name day in the country, St George's Day (–ì–µ—Ä–≥—å–æ–≤–¥–µ–Ω, Gergyovden) is a public holiday that takes place on 6 May every year. A common ritual is to prepare and eat a whole lamb. St. George is the patron saint of farmers and shepherds.A. P. Vlasto. The entry of the Slavs into Christendom. CUP Archive, 1970, , page 300 St. George's Day is also the Day of the Bulgarian Army (made official with a decree of Knyaz Alexander of Bulgaria on 9 January 1880), and parades are organised in the capital Sofia to present the best of the army's equipment and manpower. In Russia, the cult of Saint George arrived in the 11th century during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise (1010‚Äì19). The earliest icon of Saint George is at Staraya Ladoga, in a church dedicated to him, dating from the 12th century. The cult, as in Lithuania, displaced that of a pagan deity, the sun god Dazhbog, which involved shepherds bringing their flocks to pastures. Saint George was Yaroslav's patron saint, and also that of his descendant Yuri Dolgorukiy (reigned 1149‚Äì51 and 1155‚Äì57), who founded what was to become the Russian capital city, Moscow, in 1156 (Yuri is Russian for George). Cross of St. George, Russian imperial decoration for military heroism. The city's coat of arms originally displayed a mounted soldier slaying a dragon. However, it was not until 1730 that Saint George was officially adopted as Moscow's patron saint, and the mounted soldier would be interpreted as Saint George. There are several statues of Saint George and the dragon in Moscow, all of which are recent, owing to the fact that the Russian Orthodox Church forbade sculptural representations of saints, and the Soviets discouraged religious emblems. The arms of Moscow also appears on the coat of arms of Russia, as a small shield on the breast of the double-headed eagle. Two of Russia's highest decorations are called the Cross of St. George and the Order of St. George.

In the Wadi Qelt near Jericho stands the St. George's Monastery. Saint George's Monastery, Homs Saint George is among the most celebrated saints in Syria, especially among the Antiochian churches. The historical Saint George's Monastery in Meshtaye village near the city of Homs is a Greek Orthodox religious complex dating back to the 5th century. It consists of three leveled churches from the 5th, 13th and the 19th centuries respectively. The oldest one is entirely built in Byzantine style. The monastery is one of the most busiest destinations for local and foreign pilgrims, mainly at the feast of Saint George and the feast of the elevation of the Holy Cross (14 September). At Mughni (Armenia), there is a monastery dedicated to Saint George, in Armenian ’ç’∏÷Ç÷Ä’¢ ‘≥’•÷Ç’∏÷Ä’£ (Surb Gevork). First mentioned in 1278, the monastery is said to contain relics of the saint. Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia. The Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia dates to around 1200 AD. The church is dedicated to the saint, and is one of eleven monolithic churches in Lalibela, a holy city in Ethiopia and a site of pilgrimage. St. George's Cathedral in Addis Ababa is also dedicated to the saint, and the city's main football club is Saint George S.C.. A local beer is named after the saint. One of Montenegro's islands is called Sveti ƒêorƒëe (Serbian Cyrillic: –°–≤–µ—Ç–∏ –Ç–æ—Ä—í–µ), where there is a monastery devoted to the saint. Western Christianity St George on the coat of arms of Eisenach. Abbot Hatto (888‚Äì913) of the Monastic Island of Reichenau had a St George's Church erected, after he had received relics from the hands of Pope Formosus. The later Archbishop of Mainz made a major contribution to spread the veneration of Saint George throughout East Francia. The Georgslied, a set of poems and hymns to Saint George in Old High German was composed on Reichenau island and the scholar Hermann of Reichenau wrote a Historia sancti Georgii in the mid-11th century, which today is lost. About 1056 Archbishop Anno II of Cologne had the St George's Basilica erected, one of the twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne. About 30 years later, former Vogts of Reichenau Abbey established the St. George's Abbey in the Black Forest. Saint George was also a patron saint of the Teutonic Knights, the State of the Teutonic Order and present-day Lithuania. Emperor Maximilian I (1493‚Äì1519), the \\"Last Knight\\", chose Saint George his personal tutelar. Notable Italian churches named for the saint are in the Province of Ragusa, in the southern part of Sicily, in the cities of Modica (whose patron is St. George) and in Ragusa. Both of them are in the World Heritage List by UNESCO. Kerala One of the main pilgrimages of St. George in Kerala is at Edappally (Ernakulam District), where the feast is celebrated on 4 May. Edathwa also attracts thousands of pilgrims. Angamaly Basilica is named after St. George. All these three churches are Catholic churches belonging to Syro-Malabar rite. In all Christian families in India, especially Kerala, the name George or Varghese is very popular. There are numerous churches dedicated to Saint George in India, especially in Kerala, practicing Oriental Orthodoxy, and shrines to the saint. On the banks of the Kodoor River in the district of Kottayam in Kerala, the village of Puthupally is known for its 16th-century St. George Orthodox Syrian Church. The feast of this church, held on May 6 and May 7, attracts pilgrims from all over Kerala. It is one of the largest pilgrim centers of Saint George in India, where they celebrate his feast on the first Saturday and Sunday in May. A Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint George in Puthiyathura, Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, is also a pilgrim centre with an annual St George's Day celebration. In Tamil Nadu, Kanyakumari district, Nagercoil Town, Thalavaipuram‚Äîa famous church for St George and the people of the town‚Äîcelebrates the feast of St George for ten days from the second Friday of May every year. There is also a Roman Catholic church in Aleppey, Edathua, visited by pilgrims from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Cities=Eastern Christianity Saint George is the patron saint of Beirut, Lebanon. Many bays around Lebanon are named after Saint George, particularly the Saint George Bay, at the mouth of the Beirut River, as local tradition identifies it as the site where he killed the dragon.Helen Gibson, \\"St. George The Ubiquitous\\", Saudi Aramco World, Volume 22, Number 6, November/December 1971. In Lebanon, Saint George is believed to have cleaned off his spear at a massive rocky cave running into the hillside and overlooking the Jounieh Bay. Others argue it is at the Bay of Tabarja. The waters of both caves are believed to have miraculous powers for healing ailing children. A gilded icon of St. George is kept in the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Beirut. Saint George is a patron of the Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro. As in Serbia, his day, known in the local language as ƒêurƒëevdan ( ‚Äì George's day), is an important religious holiday. It is held on 23 April in the Julian calendar, corresponding to 6 May in the Gregorian calendar. Western Christianity In Mons (Belgium),Mons.be - Site officiel de la Ville de Mons Saint Georges is honoured each year on Trinity Sunday. In the heart of the city, a reconstitution (known as the \\"Combat dit Lume√ßon\\") of the fight between Saint Georges and the dragon is played by 46 actors. According to the tradition, the inhabitants of Mons try to get a piece of the dragon during the fight. This will bring luck for one year to the ones succeeding in this challenge. This event is part of the annual Ducasse festival and is attended by thousands of people. Saint George is the patron saint of the German city of Freiburg im Breisgau. He also appears on the coats of arms of several German towns and cities, including Bamberg, B√ºrgel, Die√üen am Ammersee, Eisenach, Mengeringhausen, Schwarzenberg, and, of course, Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald. Saint George killing the dragon, depicted on the military flag of the Hellenic Army. Saint George (Greek: ŒÜŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ŒìŒµœéœÅŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ) is a particularly loved and venerated Saint in Greece. He is the patron Saint of the Hellenic Army and Infantry, as well as the patron Saint of numerous Greek cities, towns and villages including Arachova, Eratyra, Goumenissa, Ierapetra, Nemea, Nigrita, Sidirokastro, Soufli, Vevi, etc. In Italy, Saint George is one of the Patron Saints of Genoa, Milan and Bologna as well as the patron saint of Ferrara, Reggio Calabria,Lewis Lockwood , Music in Renaissance Ferrara Oxford University Press, 2009 page 26Cellatica in Brescia, Sassuolo and Locorotondo. Saint George is also the patron saint of San Giorgio di Mantova (near Mantua) and San Giorgio La Molara (near Benevento). The historical bank that was the backbone of the Republic of Genoa, \\"Repubblica Marinara di Genova\\", was dedicated to St George, \\"Banco di San Giorgio\\". The power of the Repubblica passing from commerce to banking, Genoa lent money to all the European countries and sovereigns, so the power of the \\"Repubblica\\" was identified with its patron saint.Before the industrial revolution, By Carlo M. Cipolla, Published by Routledge, 1993 page 38 Two parishes are dedicated to Saint George in Malta and Gozo, the Parish of Qormi, Malta and the Parish of Victoria, Gozo. Besides being the patron of Victoria where a St. George's Basilica, Malta is dedicated to him, St George is the protector of the island Gozo.Arthur de Bles, 2004 How to Distinguish the Saints in Art page 86 In Lithuania, Saint George is the second most important patron saint, after Saint Casimir. His cult spread throughout Lithuania in the 15th century as a compromise to the former rituals to the pagan spring god Pergrubis, owing to the fact that his feast day in mainly Roman Catholic Lithuania, as in the rest of the Western Church, falls on 23 April. For most of Lithuania's modern history, the day was celebrated by farmers with offerings of animals in churches and the baking of special bread. Today several Lithuanian towns, including Marijampolƒó, Prienai and Varniai, display Saint George on their coats of arms.

History The Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway was opened in 1907 between Pittsburgh and Butler traveling via Etna, Glenshaw, Allison Park, and Mars. In 1914 the railway converted from AC to 1200V DC which reduced power consumption by 15% and reduced the weight of each car by 6 tons. In 1917 the railway amalgamated with the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, who operated the Harmony Line between Pittsburgh and New Castle, the new company being named the Pittsburgh, Mars and Butler Railway. In April 1931 the company went into receivership. The Butler Short Line was closed on April 22, 1931 as it was in poor condition, services being absorbed into the existing PA 8 bus service. The stub of the Butler Short Line continued to be used by Pittsburgh Railways as the 2 Etna service until closure in 1952. Route Leaving Butler going south along South Chestnut Street the railway crossed the rails of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) and the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad (B&LE;), before turning west down the valley of the Connoquenessing Creek through Bredinville. Running parallel to the B&LE; through Odell and then east into Thorn Creek past Renfrew Station, the line then headed south, climbing out of Thorn Creek valley alongside Three Degree Road, where the Butler Country Club had a stop of their own. When Butler County Airport was constructed Three Degree Road was diverted to use the old track bed, now forming the eastern perimeter road of the airport. The line continued south, descending into the valley of Breakneck Creek and passing through Mars. It continued south along the valley, through Downieville and Valencia to Etna, where it joined the local Pittsburgh Railways route to downtown. Incidents Two cars collided on March 27, 1909 after one was delayed by a derailment on the grade crossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Mars. The crash occurred near Bryant Station and three people died at the scene, all employees of the railway.

The first festival screening was held at the North Bondi RSL Club. Due to its success, by 2002 it has moved to its current home at the Bondi Pavilion. The Festival accepts entries in any genre, with the only restrictions being it must be Australian, under 15 minutes in length, and made in the previous 18 months. Prizes are currently awarded in four categories: Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Actor and Best Music. Whilst the competition is predominantly an amateur‚Äôs festival, films are judged by leading industry professionals. Over the years, festival judges have included Margaret Pomeranz, Sam Worthington, Bruce Beresford, Rachel Ward, Damon Gameau, David Caeser and Gracie Otto.

It contains over 150 graves of early and mid-19th century residents of the city, all from the period between 1812 and 1871. It was restored in the 1980s after suffering from almost a century of neglect. Gideon Putnam was the city's founder. He built one of its first resort hotels, and laid out the grid plan that guided its subsequent development. He intended for this parcel to be used as a public cemetery, and became its first burial after his death from injuries sustained in a construction accident. His grave is the only extant remnant of his presence in the city he founded. His premature death and burial meant that, apart from the Putnam family plot, it was not used much as a public cemetery since no plans or preparation had been made for that purpose. In 2003 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The cemetery is on an irregularly shaped plot on the east side of South Franklin just south of Grand Avenue, opposite the Oak Street junction. It is just outside the Broadway and West Side historic districts. The neighborhood is residential, with houses across South Franklin to the west and an apartment complex on the east. A chainlink fence runs along South Franklin. There are 161 marked graves scattered around the property, in no regular pattern. Most headstones are of marble or granite; some are unadorned and others show common 19th-century funerary art such as urn-and-willow motifs. On a rise in the north central portion is the Putnam family plot, surrounded by a fieldstone wall with smooth stone coping. Access to it is provided by a wrought iron gate with stone lintel. The graves of Gideon Putnam and his wife are marked by obelisks. History Putnam arrived in the area in 1789 from his native Connecticut to get into the lumber business. He soon saw the potential of the springs to attract visitors to the region, and built the first hotel, Putnam's Tavern (later the Union House) in 1802 near Congress Spring in what is today Congress Park. It was a success. Three years later, in 1805, he bought the surrounding the spring and began laying out a plan for the village of Saratoga Springs. When published in 1810, it included the current parcel as a non-sectarian community burial ground. The next year, Putnam fell from a scaffold while overseeing the construction of another hotel, Congress Hall. He ultimately died of complications from the injuries late in 1812 and became the burying ground's first occupant. Since it had not yet been prepared for use as a cemetery, and there was no entity to oversee its use, no plan was in place. The Putnams continued to use it as their family plot, and allowed other local residents to be buried there with their permission. They turned it over to the village in 1835, three years after the construction of the Schenectady & Saratoga Railroad and the extension of South Franklin Street had required new boundaries on the east and west. Burials increased in the 1830s and 1840s after it became a public graveyard. The neighborhood around it continued to grow and be developed, leaving it somewhat isolated from other open space and the village's downtown. In 1844 a new, larger public cemetery was opened on the west of the village, and burials trailed off until the last one occurred in 1871. Maintenance declined, and within four years residents deplored the neglected condition of the cemetery, with overturned headstones and overgrown graves. A survey conducted in 1876 recorded 250 separate inscriptions, but as the neglect continued into the 20th century, the decay and vandalism took their toll. By 1922 the local Daughters of the American Revolution could identify just 89 graves. Extensive restoration efforts in the 1980s led to the current number of graves identified. Since then it has been regularly maintained and secured.

Early years and education Born in Beloit, Wisconsin, LaPiere obtained his B.A. in Economics (1926), followed by his M.A in Sociology (1927) and his Ph.D in Sociology (1930), all at Stanford University. ‚ÄòAttitudes vs. Actions‚Äô article LaPiere is best known for his 1934 article \\"Attitudes vs. Actions\\" that appeared in the journal Social Forces. LaPiere spent two years traveling the United States by car with a couple of Chinese ethnicity. At the time there was substantial anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States, e.g., as reflected in the Chinese Exclusion Act of the late 19th Century. During that time they visited 251 hotels and restaurants and, while LaPiere reports that some people greeting them looked curious, they were turned away only once. LaPiere concludes that positive reactions were associated with factors unrelated to the race of the couple (such as neat appearance and smiling). and his data reflect his own interpretations of what occurred at each stop. LaPiere's language and conclusions in the paper reflect his own racial views and awareness gaps of the time. For example, he interprets curiosity as treatment \\"more positive than typical.\\" Six months after the conclusion of their travels (to provide a chance to forget their behavior), LaPiere mailed a survey to all of the businesses they visited with the question, \\"Will you accept members of the Chinese race in your establishment?\\" The available responses were \\"Yes\\", \\"No\\", and \\"Depends upon the circumstances\\". Of the 128 that responded, 92% answered No, reflecting the anti-Chinese sentiments of the time. LaPiere also mailed a survey to a comparison group of hotels and restaurants that had not been visited, and their responses were similar. The study was foundational in establishing the gap between attitudes and behaviors. Memberships and accolades LaPiere was an elected member of Alpha Kappa Delta and the Sociological Research Association, and a past president of the Pacific Sociological Association. In 1941 he was awarded a California Book Award silver medal for his fiction work When the Living Strive. Personal life LaPiere married in 1934 and died of cancer in 1986. The Department of Sociology at Stanford University's annual research award for best graduate student paper is named in LaPiere's honor.

Its eastern terminus is more than to the east at a T-intersection with U.S. Route 36 about west of the village of Nellie. Route description State Route 229 runs through portions of five counties: Marion, Delaware, Morrow, Knox and Coshocton. No part of this state highway is included within the National Highway System, a system of highways deemed most vital to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History When it was first established in 1930, State Route 229 ran from its junction with State Route 61 west of Marengo to downtown Mount Vernon. In 1937, the highway was extended on the western end to a new endpoint at U.S. Route 23 south of Waldo. Two years later, State Route 229 was extended again, this time on the east side, to its current eastern terminus in extreme western Coshocton County west of Nellie at what was then State Route 715, which would later trade alignments with U.S. Route 36. By 1974, the route officially took on the routing that it has today when it was extended slightly on the western end, running a short distance west of the U.S. Route 23 expressway before turning north onto the former two- lane alignment of U.S. Route 23, and following that roadway up to its current western terminus just south of Waldo where State Route 47 comes in and takes over the old routing of U.S. Route 23.

Clarke had the reputation of being a reliable seaman, and claimed to know the area well, so Meade allowed him to take the helm at about 1.30 a.m. Shortly afterward, spotting the approach of three huge waves on the starboard quarter, the two men shouted to rouse the crew and endeavored to bring the yacht's head round to clear the southern end of the wave, or at least to receive it bow foremost. Before the yacht rounded, the first wave struck, swamping the dingy that was towing astern.

The band were pioneers of this new genre of rock amongst others such as Witchfinder General, Diamond Head, Jameson Raid, Angel Witch and Iron Maiden. Rekuiem pursued their own style of metal which later became known as doom metal. They were influenced by Black Sabbath and wanted to create something that was even heavier. Early career After many rehearsals the band began to play local gigs in the Midlands at venues such as Cannock Forum and the Lafayette Club in Wolverhampton. The band soon built up a local fan base. This period also produced some early demos recorded at M.R.S. Studios in Walsall. In 1980 the band recorded at Foel Studios the now rare double A-sided single \\"Angel of Sin\\" / \\"Sacrificial Wanderer\\", mixed by Dave Anderson (Hawkwind). Two years after the founding, front man Mike Reid left the band due to musical differences, and his replacement was Steve Mills. Three further studio demos and gigs in the UK followed, both as headline act and as support act to Budgie on their European tour. After that the band worked on the release of their debut album 'Immanent', but this was never released. Despite the adversity, Rekuiem continued to gig around the UK. But in 1984 bass player Gordon left the band to form Rough Justice. He was replaced by Tim Harris. The band tried to reshape again, new songs were written, and a new image and concept discussed, but eventually at the General Wolfe in Coventry, Rekuiem came to an end. Steve Mills and Tim Harris went on to work with Dave Brock of Hawkwind fame. Steve Slater and Karl Wilcox briefly joined forces to join Broken English and studio recordings were made entitled Makin' Out and Two Time Love. Wilcox then went on to join the progressive rock band Chase, before joining Diamond Head, with whom he has recorded several albums. Slater formed Predator who toured the UK extensively. Reunion In 2002 a new worldwide interest in metal, specifically the underground NWOBHM movement, brought Rekuiem back to the music scene. Enquiries from all over the world about past recordings and about the chance of a reunion brought some of the band members together again. Due to the founding of a couple of other bands in the past years under the same name, the band members decided to change the spelling in Rekuiem. For a time period of three years, the band wrote and recorded the promised album that was never delivered twenty years ago. Three original members, Steve Slater (guit), Karl Wilcox (drums) and Gordon Denny (bass) joined forces with Paul Parry (vocals), formerly with Tredegar, and Neil Taylor (keyboards), who has worked before with Cloven Hoof, Demon and the Ozzy Osbourne tribute Ozzmosis. The band released an EP for the rock press. This EP featured five demo tracks for the anticipated album, \\"Steelbreeze\\", \\"Angel of Sin\\", \\"Nightmare\\", \\"The Black Death\\" and \\"Outro\\". All of these are different versions to those that appeared on the finished album, and two of these songs do not appear on the album at all, making this a highly collectable piece. The taster EP was entitled \\"The Black Death\\". The album Time Will Tell was released in April 2006 at Majestic Rock label. It featured ten original tracks (eleven on the Japanese edition) and one cover version of \\"Paranoid\\". The album was produced by Slater and Wilcox and was mixed by Mark Stuart (Magnum). The album also featured the newly recorded versions of \\"Angel of Sin\\" and \\"Sacrificial Wanderer\\". In November 2007, Parry was replaced by the Sri Lankan born Chitral Somapala. He had recorded and toured with Firewind in the past and is currently working also with his own band Civilization One, and the German progressive metal band Red Circuit. Currently the band is working on the release of their second album, 'Raise the Dead'.

Bernard, was an early 20th-century American alternative health, esoteric writer and mystic, who formed part of the alternative reality subculture. Biography Siegmeister was born into a family of Russian Jews in Manhattan, New York City. His parents were William Siegmeister (May 1877 - September 1, 1932) and Rebecca \\"Bessie\\" Gitler (Gittler) (February 25, 1880 - October 27, 1968),http://sortedbyname.com/mobile/pages/s155875.html (scroll down the page until you arrive at \\"Siegmeister, Bessie\\") who were both born in Russia. Walter's father William emigrated to the United States in July 1893,https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV5Y-YHNV (Passport Application of Rebecca Siegmeister - click on \\"View the original document\\") and he became a naturalized citizen in the Superior Court, New York County (Manhattan) on October 29, 1902. Walter's parents William and Bessie are both buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Glendale, Queens County, New York. Walter's father was a surgeon who started out as a student of biochemistry in Germany. Walter had a brother named Elie Siegmeister (1909-1991) who was a famous American composer. Walter graduated from Columbia University in 1924, and received his Masters (1930) and Ph.D (1932) degrees in education from New York University. His Ph.D thesis was titled Theory and Practice of Dr. Rudolf Steiner's Pedagogy (New York University, School of Education, 1932) (typed manuscript, v + 320 pages). Under the name Bernard, Walter later settled in Florida. Siegmeister died of pneumonia in 1965. Alternative health Siegmeister was a natural hygiene and raw food advocate. He authored many books on dieting and nutrition such as Meat-Eating: A Cause of Disease (1956), Super Health Thru Organic Super Food (1958) and Health Through Scientific Nutrition (1960). He was alleged to have practiced breatharianism and a fruitarian diet. However, it was noted by H. Jay Dinshah that he was actually living as a vegan.Noteworthy 1970s-era expos√© of numerous alleged fruitarians found no successes, and widespread misrepresentation of diets actually eaten. Retrieved 8 April 2018. Hollow earth Siegmeister was a proponent of the hollow earth concept and UFOs. His ideas were never taken seriously by academics and have been dismissed as pseudoscience.Regal, Brian. (2009). Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia. Greenwood. p. 84. Siegmeister wrote of his search for the safest place on Earth from radioactive fallout in order to build a paradise. The idea was later developed in the writings of Johnny Lovewisdom and then Viktoras Kulvinskas. He went to Ecuador in 1941 where he met John Wierlo (pen-name: Johnny Lovewisdom, aka \\"the Hermit Saint of the Andes\\") (July 23, 1919 - October 12, 2000) who had arrived in 1940, where they spoke of plans for a paradisian utopia and a super-race in the Ecuadorean jungle.J. M. Sheppard, \\"Disaster in Paradise\\", The American Weekly in The Milwaukee Sentinel, December 24, 1944, p. 17. However Wierlo later claimed he was not planning on creating a super-race, only a Camp of Saints. On returning to the USA, Siegmeister, now called Robert Raymond, continued to sell his books, before returning to South America. Walter moved to Brazil in 1955 or 1956, in order to buy land and create a super-race. In Brazil, he renewed his interest in aliens, Atlantis, UFOs, tunnels and the hollow earth concept. Siegmeister believed Brazil contained the entrances to the tunnels leading to the hollow earth. In 1964, he found a New York publisher for The Hollow Earth which was based on his book Flying Saucers from the Earth's Interior. The book describes a purported conspiracy to conceal the existence of the hollow earth and its access points at the poles.James R. Lewis, The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, (Prometheus Books, 2002), , p. 399. Excerpts available at Google Books.

Her life story was made into the Emmy Award-winning 1979 film Friendly Fire starring Carol Burnett, which was based on a 1976 book of the same name by C. D. B. Bryan. Early life Born in 1917 in Pocahontas, Iowa to Clair and Josephine (n√©e Wolfe) Goodyear, Mullen attended Sacred Heart High School, moving to Des Moines after graduation.

She refused to believe the United States Army's description of the incident as an accident and remained skeptical even after evidence was provided to support the official story. Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. met with the Mullens in an unsuccessful attempt to address their questions, later writing in his autobiography It Doesn't Take a Hero of the double tragedy of \\"the needless death of a young man, and the bitterness that was consuming his parents.\\" With the death benefit she received from the military, Mullen purchased two half- page ads in The Des Moines Register, with the first ad featuring 714 crosses and the second with 719 to represent the number of Iowa residents killed during the war. Mullen refused a military funeral for her son, would not accept his medals, and rejected the standard grave marker offered for free by the military. Instead, she bought a tombstone that used the word \\"killed\\" (instead of \\"died\\") to describe the circumstances of his death. A letter of condolence from President of the United States Richard M. Nixon was sent back with her note reading \\"Send it to the next damn fool.\\" Friendly Fire Journalist C. D. B. Bryan turned the Mullen family's intense pain in the wake of Michael's death into a series of articles published in three installments in The New Yorker during March 1976 and then released in book form that year as Friendly Fire. Bryan wrote of the unspoken sounds of pain, \\"the slam of a hand hitting the table in rage, the breath caught because an onrushing memory was causing too much pain.\\" The book was turned into the 1979 television film Friendly Fire, starring Carol Burnett. Though best known for her screwball comedy, Burnett pursued the role after reading the script and said how in looking \\"back at the war now, I see how much of a waste it was\\", with this film being \\"the first time that the war has been looked at from the viewpoint of the folks at home.\\"Gamarekian, Barbara. \\"Why Carol Burnett Made 'Friendly Fire'; War 'a Waste'\\", The New York Times, April 21, 1979.

Personal Mullen wrote the 1995 autobiography Unfriendly Fire: A Mother's Memoir, which added dozens of letters from her son and laid out her continuing doubts about the circumstances of her son's death. She continued her anti-war activism in protesting the Gulf War, and tried to meet with Cindy Sheehan, a mother whose son was killed during the Iraq War, at Sheehan's protests outside George W.

It was an episcopal see during Late Antiquity, and remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. Residential bishopric and archbishopric  As secular capital of the Roman province of Honorias, in the civil Diocese of Pontus, the bishopric of Claudiopolis became the metropolitan see, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, with five suffragan sees : Heraclea Pontica, Prusias ad Hypium, Tium, Cratia and Hadrianopolis in Honoriade. It appears as such in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Pseudo-Epiphanius of about 640 and in that of Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise of the early 10th century, ranking sixteenth viz. seventeenth among the Patriarchate's Metropolitans. The city, known as Claudiopolis (like several others) under Byzantine rule fell to Turks migrating west in the 11th century who called it Boli, was recaptured by Byzantines in 1097, besieged unsuccessfully by the Sultanate of Rum in 1177 and reconquered in 1197. Under Ottoman rule since the 14th century it lost to Heraclea Pontica the Metropolitan dignity. It ceased to exist as a residential bishopric in the 15th century.

History The first Homegrown event was held in September 2000 at The Jam (now Mercury Live). The event was masterminded by Algorythm Recordings. The idea behind it is to get South African drum and bass crews Algorythm, Sublime and Krushed & Sorted under one roof, once a month, for the first time. The focus is promoting artists who produce drum and bass locally, hence the name \\"Homegrown\\". In 2001, Mercury Live offered Homegrown a monthly residency, making it a permanent fixture in the South African drum and bass scene. With drum and bass music requiring well-engineered, large sound systems, Algorythm developed a long working relationship with Hellfire Sound.

The male of C. xanthostoma generally has more extensive colouring in the wings than that of C.splendens, usually reaching to the wingtips. Unlike C. splendens, the males have clear wings when first emerging as adults, only developing the wing colour during the first week as an adult.

History Strassfield was built prior to World War II as a grass airfield, most likely as a small airport serving the Euskirchen area. The Luftwaffe did not use the airfield until March, 1940 when Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 31 (AKG 31), a light reconnaissance unit flying Focke-Wulf Fw 189As, a light, twin engine reconnaissance plane was assigned to the airfield. The FW 189s were used to patrol the Franco-German border area prior to the invasion of the west on 10 May 1940. Shortly afterward, the unit was moved into Belgium, and later France to support the advancing German forces. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 The only other known use by the Luftwaffe of the airfield was in 1943, when 3 Fallschirm-J√§ger-Division (Parachute Infantry Division) was assigned to the field. During the early 1940s, the airfield was improved, with Luftwaffe engineers laying down a 5000' concrete runway aligned 07/25. American Army units moved into the Euskirchen area in early March 1945 as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany and the airfield was attacked by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers to deny the retreating German forces use of the facility. The airfield was taken about 5 March. Combat engineers from IX Engineer command moved in with the 820th Engineering Aviation Battalion arriving on 10 March 1945, to repair the field for use by combat aircraft. Ongoing combat in the area and materiel shortages extended the repair time to about two weeks. The engineers laid down a 5000' Pierced Steel Planking all- weather runway over the bomb-cratered concrete runway, and performed minimal repairs to the facility to make it operational. On 29 March, the airfield was declared ready for Allied use and was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-59 Strassfeld\\".IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Once repaired, Ninth Air Force fighter units moved in, the first being the 474th Fighter Group, flying P-38 Lightnings from the field from late March until the end of the war, attacking German army units, bridges and other ground targets of opportunity throughout Germany. In addition to the Lightnings, P-61 Black Widow night air defense interceptors were assigned to the field (414th, 422d Night Fighter Squadrons) briefly in April Maurer, Maurer.

The only relic of the airfield today is the 5000' runway, largely intact, overgrown with a thick cover of vegetation. Just northwest of the runway is a postwar antenna farm used by the Bundespolizei (BPOL), former Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS), as a HF bearing signal, built on what probably was the site of the airfield's ground station. The antenna farm is fenced to restrict entry, with a concrete access road from the K 61 highway, which bisects the former airfield.

It holds that indemnities can be claimed under English law for any consequential costs of a contract not turning on an innocent misrepresentation (such as rent). Facts Mr Whittington bred prize poultry. He bought a long farm lease, induced by Seale-Hayne's representation that the premises were sanitary and in good repair. However, the water supply was poisoned, Mr Whittington‚Äôs manager got very ill and the poultry died. Under the lease, Mr Whittington had covenanted to carry out repairs required by the council, which were needed after the council declared the premises unfit for habitation and the drains needed renewing. It was undisputed that Whittington was entitled to indemnity for rates paid or repairs costs. Whittington sought rescission and indemnity for loss of poultry, profits and medical expenses. Judgment Farwell J held no further losses could be claimed because it was beyond the ambit of the indemnity to which Mr Whittington was entitled. The losses did not result in a benefit to Seale. Since the representation was not fraudulent, there could be no damages and therefore no compensation either. It was not the case that the rescinder should be in a position status quo ante because 'to make good by way of compensation for the consequences of the misrepresentations is the same thing as asking for damages'. Significance There would now be a common law claim under Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd or under s 2(1) Misrepresentation Act 1967 for damages.

It was created around the middle of the 8th century, comprising most of the ancient region of Paphlagonia and parts of Galatia and Phrygia.. History The theme was established sometime after 743 and before 767 by the Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775), following the suppression of the revolt of Artabasdos, the Count of the Opsikion. The new theme, along with that of the Optimatoi was split off from the Opsikion as formed part of the Emperor's policy to reduce the latter's power.... The name of the theme derives from the late Roman Bucellarii, elite cavalry troops of Gothic or Roman origin, often found as privately recruited bodyguard troops. By the early 7th century, they formed an elite division in the Opsikion field force, coming under a domestikos before their elevation to a full theme.. The strategos of the Bucellarians is attested for the first time in 767, providing a terminus ante quem for its creation. His headquarters were at Ancyra, the former capital of Opsikion, and he belonged to the second tier of strategoi with an annual salary of 30 pounds of gold. According to Arab geographers, he commanded some 8,000 troops. The court ranks of the Bucellarian strategoi ranged from the mid-level spatharios to the higher protospatharios, with a single occurrence of the more exalted patrikios in the 10th century. Claudiopolis is the only attested base of one of the theme's tourmai. Despite it being originally a cavalry theme (thema kaballarikon), the Bucellarians, as well as the later Paphlagonian theme, also included a small fleet, active in the Black Sea. The \\"katepano of the Bucellarians and the Paphlagonians\\", whose seal is attested in the 10th century, was the commander of this naval contingent. However, evidence points to the fact that the 10th-century fleet was composed of merchantmen and transport ships, not warships.. Initially, the theme stretched from the Black Sea coast to the central Anatolian plateau, bordering the Optimatoi and the rump of the Opsikion in the west, the Anatolic theme in the south, and the Armeniac theme in the east. In the 9th century, however, probably c. 820, the northeastern half of the theme was detached and formed, perhaps with some territory from the Armeniac theme, the new theme of Paphlagonia. Its extent was further reduced under Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912), when eight southern and southeastern banda were removed to form part of the new themes of Cappadocia (around Lake Tuz) and Charsianon (east of the Halys River). In the 9th century, it comprised two towns and thirteen fortresses, while five towns are recorded in the 10th century. The theme survived until it was overrun by the Seljuk Turks following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The name Boukellari≈çn, however, survived as a geographical designation in Byzantine sources up until 1263.

McDonald and Patrick Robinson which chronicles the events surrounding the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the context of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 and the subprime mortgage crisis. The work is divided into a prologue, an epilogue, and twelve chapters. As of August 9, 2009, the book was 7th on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction. A Colossal Failure of Common Sense is translated into 12 different languages. Summary The book is highly critical of Richard Fuld, Henry Paulson, and the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act, a 1999 act of Congress signed by former United States President Bill Clinton that repealed portions of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act of 1933. The book contains an account of how McDonald, after attending the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, selling pork chops, and self-teaching himself the material required to pass the General Securities Representative Exam, went on to develop the website ConvertBond.com, which was later purchased by Morgan Stanley.McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, pp. 14, 25, 43. The author's stated expertise, in the convertible bond market, was what allowed him to create the website ConvertBond.com during the dot-com bubble, and successfully sell it to Morgan Stanley before the Internet bubble burst. It was while he was working at Morgan Stanley that McDonald was offered a job as vice- president at Lehman Brothers.McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, p. 79. The book characterizes Richard Fuld as being out of touch, smug, and a ruthless CEO with a short temper and a penchant for rage.McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, pp. 91. The book sarcastically refers to Fuld as \\"his majesty,\\" \\"god-like,\\" and a \\"spiritual leader.\\"McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, p. 90 McDonald believes that the United States government should have saved Lehman Brothers, and that Dick Fuld falsely believed that the United States government would save the company after having a meeting with Henry Paulson in the spring of 2008, which led him to engage in unnecessarily risky behavior and reject an offer of $18 per share from the Korea Development Bank as late as August 2008.\\"Book Review: A Colossal Failure of Common Sense\\" - Canadian Capitalist Retrieved December 30, 2009\\"Ex-Insider's Book Details Lehman Brothers Collapse\\" - NPR.org Retrieved December 30, 2009 Chapters # A Rocky Road to Wall Street # Scaring Morgan Stanley to Death # Only the Bears Smiled # The Man in the Ivory Tower # A Miracle on the Waterway # The Day Delta Air Lines Went Bust # The Tragedy of General Motors # The Mortgage Bonanza Blows Out # King Richard Thunders Forward # A $100 Million Crash for Subprime's Biggest Beast # Wall Street Stunned as Kirk Quits # Fuld, Defiant to the End See also * List of entities involved in 2007‚Äì2008 financial crises * Subprime crisis impact timeline NotesReferencesExternal links * Book page at Random House, Inc. * Excerpt from the book at NYTimes.com Category:Books about traders Category:Lehman Brothers Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:Business books Category:Finance books ","title":"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense"},{"id":"24600249","text":"Eliezer (ben Solomon) of Touques was a French tosafist, who lived at Touques in the second half of the thirteenth century.

Certainly the prioress of Fontevrault wrote frequently to Edward I asking that his daughter be allowed to live there. Probably to prevent his daughter falling into French hands in the event of war with England, Edward refused, and Mary remained at Amesbury, while her allowance was doubled to ¬£200 per year. In 1292, she was also given the right to forty oaks per year from royal forests and twenty tuns of wine per year from Southampton. Representative of the order Despite being a resident at the priory, Mary began to travel the country. She visited her brother Edward in 1293, and regularly attended court, spending five weeks there in 1297, in the run-up to her sister Elizabeth's departure to Holland. By the end of the century, she held the post of vicegerent and visitatrix for the abbess, with the right to authorise the transfer of nuns between convents.Berenice M. Kerr, Religious life for women, c.1100-c.1350: Fontevraud in England, p.136 In 1302, her ¬£200 per year was replaced by the rights to several manors and the borough of Wilton, all held on condition that she remain in England. However, she ran up considerable dice gambling debts while visiting her father's court, and in 1305 was given ¬£200 to pay them off.Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England, vol.2, p.421, p.431, p.434, She was also given Grove Priory in Bedfordshire to manage, holding this until her death.The Medieval Manor of Leighton Alias Grovebury , Bedfordshire County Council Mary was unsuccessful in obtaining high office in the order, whereas Eleanor of Brittany became abbess at Fontevrault in 1304. The papal bull Periculoso was read at Amesbury in 1303, requiring nuns to remain within their religious establishments, but Mary's travels do not appear to have been affected. She went on numerous pilgrimages, including one to Canterbury, and continued to visit court, with a retinue of up to twenty-four horses, sometimes with fellow nuns. Soon after 1313, her role as visitor was removed. In 1317, Mary's brother Edward, by now King Edward II, asked Eleanor to restore her to the post, but his request was refused. But Mary persevered and obtained a papal mandate requiring her reinstatement, which Eleanor appears to have obeyed. Later life Despite her apparent conflict with Eleanor, Mary continued to live comfortably. In 1316, she was able to borrow more than ¬£2 from abbey funds (approximately ¬£ in ), and sent a clerk to London on personal errands, at the priory's expense. It was effectively as a princess, not a nun, that Mary received the homage of the English Dominican friar Nicholas Trevet, a prolific and versatile university scholar and author, who in 1328‚Äì1334 dedicated to her his Cronicles,Full title Les Cronicles qe frere N. Trevet escript a dame Marie. which she may even have commissioned him to write.\\"Trevet, Nicolas\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Intended as an amusing history of the world, it later became an important source for several popular works of the period. In part it is an account of Mary's own Plantagenet clan, and she herself is given a flattering mention there: > the fourth daughter was dame Mary of whom it ys before sayde that she wedded > herself unto the hygh king heaven.

Trevet here quotes from Jesus' words in the Gospel of Luke (10:42), where Jesus good-humouredly defends Mary to her sister Martha. It is a somewhat daring use of the Gospel text, which was traditionally often applied the Virgin Mary.Giles Constable, The Interpretation of Martha and Mary, in Giles Constable, Three Studies in Medieval Religious and Social Thought, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1995, pp. 1‚Äì114. Likewise because of Mary's status, several nobles who wished their daughters to take vows placed them into her custody. Mary died before 8 July 1332, and was buried in Amesbury Abbey. After her death, John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, attempting to divorce Mary's niece Joan, claimed to have had an affair with Mary before he married Joan. If John's claim was valid, his marriage to Mary's niece would have been rendered null and void, but despite papal mandates for inquests to be made into the matter, the truth was never established.Calendar of the Entries in the Papal Registers, Papal Letters, volume 3, 1342‚Äì1362, p. 169 AncestorsReferences Category:1278 births Category:1332 deaths Category:13th-century English people Category:14th-century English people Category:13th-century English women Category:14th-century English women Category:Benedictine nuns Category:English princesses Category:House of Plantagenet Category:14th-century Christian nuns Category:Daughters of kings ","title":"Mary of Woodstock"},{"id":"24600425","text":"James Dallas Yeomans (April 21, 1845 - October 31, 1906) was an American politician and railway executive, who served from 1894 to 1905 as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Born in Bennington, New York, and educated there, Yeomans worked as a railwayman from age 17, rising to the position of general superintendent. After spending time building railways, he moved to Iowa, where was elected to the State Senate. He became head of a manufacturer's association, and was appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1894 by President Grover Cleveland. Yeomans was reappointed by President William McKinley and then by Theodore Roosevelt. He retired from the commission in 1905 and spent time pursuing his business interests until he died in Washington, D.C., in 1906. Early life Yeomans was born in Bennington, New York, and educated in the public schools there. In 1862, he obtained a job with the Erie Railroad Company, and served two years with the company. He then went to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and worked on railroads for the Federal Government for the remainder of the American Civil War. Executive Yeomans returned to the Northeast after the war. In 1872, he became assistant superintendent of the Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railway, and a year later was made its superintendent. He also served as General Superintendent of the Olean, Bradford and Warren Railway. He was then involved in railroad building in New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Politics In 1888, Yeomans moved to Iowa, where he engaged in stock farming. In 1890, he was elected to the Iowa State Senate. Yeomans helped organize the Sioux City Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association, which became powerful in protecting the interest of the commercial cities of the Upper Midwest. It was the work for the association that suggested him as a candidate for the ICC. On April 2, 1894, President Cleveland appointed him to fill an unexpired term through 1898, filling a vacancy caused by the death of Commissioner James W. McDill. Yeomans was confirmed by the Senate on April 27, and took the oath of office five days later. He was reappointed by President McKinley on January 6, 1899, for a full term ending December 31, 1904, and was confirmed the following day. President Roosevelt reappointed Yeomans on January 13, 1905, for a third term, and Yeomans was confirmed by the Senate the same day. He resigned on March 1, 1905, effective March 6, and was succeeded by former Senator Francis Cockrell. After his retirement from the ICC, Yeomans devoted himself to his business interests. He died October 31, 1906, according to The New York Times of a complication of disease.

History Before the use of rubbing mud, baseballs were rubbed in a mixture of water and infield soil, but this method usually discolored the ball's leather surface. Other alternatives at the time were tobacco juice, shoe polish, and soil from under stadium bleachers. They were able to successfully take off the sheen from baseballs, but at the same time, they also damaged and scratched the ball's leather. While Lena Blackburne was a third-base coach for the Philadelphia Athletics baseball team, an umpire complained to him about the method used at the time, prompting Blackburne in 1938 to set out in search of better mud to use to rub against baseballs. Later that decade, Blackburne discovered the rubbing mud's location (said to be \\"near\\" Palmyra, New Jersey) and founded the company that he used to sell it. According to the company, the entire American League used the mud soon after its discovery, and by the 1950s, it was in use by every major league team, along with some minor league and college teams. When advancing age prevented Blackburne from harvesting the mud, he left the company to a friend, John Haas (Blackburne died in 1968); according to the company, Haas had accompanied Blackburne during his searches for an appropriate mud. Haas later left the company to his son-in-law Burns Bintliff, who in turn selected one of his nine children, current owner Jim, to carry on the business. Jim Bintliff told CNN in 2009 that the company only brought in about $20,000 per year; at the time, he worked full-time as a printing press operator. Usage The mud originates from the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. The mud is cleaned and screened before sale. Each year Jim Bintliff visits the mud's source and returns with 1,000 pounds of it to store over the winter and sells it the following baseball season. Bintliff told CNN: > If anybody happens to catch me in the act of harvesting mud, I come up with > a story to give them a reason I'm putting mud in a bucket. I've told people > I use it in my garden, I use it for my rose bushes, I use it for bee stings > and poison ivy and any kind of story. Before all major- and minor-league baseball games, an umpire or clubhouse attendant rubs six dozen or more balls with the mud to give them a rougher surface, to make them easier for pitchers to grip, and to comply with MLB Rule 4.01(c), which states that all baseballs shall be \\"properly rubbed so that the gloss is removed.\\" The rubbing mud's unique feature is that it is \\"very fine, like thick chocolate pudding\\", and it has been considered the \\"perfect baseball-rubbing mud\\".

Each year AIESEC chooses a socio-cultural theme globally and implements it locally. History AIESEC Morocco was founded in 1986 and came into existence at the Graduate School of International Management (ESIG) in Casablanca. It is based at the Supinfo school. 2009 campaign  In 2009 the organisers chose to organise a campaign to warn youth against the dangers of HIV and AIDS. According to them, taboos are being broken, and the Moroccan youth is sufficiently mature and open to be warned about subjects such as sexuality, dangerous practices, and drug abuse. Six schools in Rabat (Moulay Youssef, Ben Mbarek, Zahra, Stwaki, Dar Essalam, Les Orangers) and four in Casablanca (Al Jabr, Lyautey, Mohammed V and La R√©sidence) have been chosen to participate. Battouma, a member of AIESEC-Anfa, whose premises are located at the Supinfo school said: \\"We want to make things more fun by having them explained by young people, but by being direct\\". Operation ASK 2009, organised by youngsters for youngsters, is divided into four phases over three months. From 1 January to 16 January, the AIESEC welcomes young specialists who are to work with the schools. Battoum adds, \\"Because these youngsters are themselves students, and are from far afield, this can only better capture the attention of our students\\". The campaign was launched with an opening ceremony on 17 January at the Biblioth√®que nationale de Rabat (National Library in Rabat) and continued until 18 April at the closing ceremony. Many training sessions have been held for international and local specialists aged between 18 and 25. More than 100 students are being taught to become binome trainers. In partnership with YPEER, the network of binome trainers organised a conference 14 February on AIDS and youth in the ESCA, facilitated by Abdessamad, a young teacher from YPEER/ALCS (Youth Peer Education Network/American Council of Learned Societies) as part of the training programme. A second conference was held 7 March, focusing on the vulnerability and the changes of behaviour in youth. The closing ceremony was held in the form of plays, realised by the students themselves, with the objective of making youngsters react and to implicate all of the actors concerned in this debate.

A veterinarian by profession, he held various positions in the government of Cameroon from 1970 to 1983, ultimately serving as Minister of State for the Armed Forces.Page on Maikano at government website . Later, he was the Government Delegate to the Urban Commune of Garoua from 1996 to 2009,\\"Hommage appuy√© √† Maikano Abdoulaye\\", Cameroon Tribune, 2 March 2009 . and in 2009 he was appointed as Roving Ambassador. Education and early career Maikano was born in Gaschiga, located in the Garoua arrondissement of Benoue Department.Gr√©goire Djarmaila and Daniel Ibrahima, \\"Le jardin secret de Ma√Økano Abdoulaye\\" , Cameroon Tribune, 5 December 2003 . He received his primary education at Garoua's regional school and attended secondary school at Bongor in Chad from 1947 to 1948. As a Muslim, he learned to recite the Koran as a child, although he did so without any knowledge of Arabic. He was included in the first group of students from northern Cameroon to be sent to France in 1950; the group was sent by Ahmadou Ahidjo, who was a delegate in the Representative Assembly of Cameroon. After completing veterinary studies in France, he returned to Cameroon in July 1964; by that point Cameroon had obtained its independence, with Ahidjo as its President. From 27 July 1964 to January 1966, Maikano was deputy head of the northern sector of animal husbandry at Maroua. He was appointed as Director of Animal Husbandry and Animal Industries at East Cameroon's Secretariat of State for Animal Husbandry in 1966. Political career Maikano was first appointed to the government of Cameroon as Minister of the Civil Service on 12 June 1970. He was instead appointed as Minister of Planning and Urban and Regional Planning (Am√©nagement du territoire) on 3 July 1972, and then as Minister of Animal Husbandry and Animal Industries on 30 June 1975. Three years later, on 2 May 1978, he was moved back to his former post as Minister of the Civil Service.West Africa, Issues 3155-3180 (1978), p. 1,029. His name was officially changed from Abdoulaye Maikano to Maikano Abdoulaye on 9 March 1979.Dieudonn√© Ga√Øba√Ø, \\"Maikano Abdoulaye - Le sursaut du briscard\\", Mutations, 2 July 2009 . He was appointed as Minister of the Armed Forces on 17 July 1980, and he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State on 7 January 1982, while retaining the armed forces portfolio. He was Acting Prime Minister for a time in 1982.Official Gazette of the United Republic of Cameroon, 1 March 1982, page 475. Maikano was viewed as a loyalist of Ahidjo,Joseph Takougang and Milton Krieger, African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads (2000), page 65. who was President until resigning on 4 November 1982; after he resigned, Ahidjo was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya. According to Maikano, he was not informed of Ahidjo's resignation in advance and learned of it along with the rest of the country; he also said that Ahidjo called him and other members of the northern elite into a meeting and asked them to \\"work with [Biya] as you have with me\\". Maikano initially retained his post as Minister of State for the Armed Forces under President Biya, but a political feud soon developed between Ahidjo and Biya. Biya dismissed some Ahidjo loyalists from the government on 18 June 1983, although Maikano still kept his post; Ahidjo reacted angrily to the changes and called the ministers from northern Cameroon to a meeting at his home later on the same day. At that meeting, he told the northern ministers that they should resign from the government, hoping that by doing so they would undermine Biya. Maikano also held a meeting in Yaound√© at the home of Ibrahim Wadjiri, the Delegate-General of the Gendarmerie, at which he explained Ahidjo's plan to top military officers from the north, while also telling the officers that they should stay out of the situation due to its political nature. Ahidjo did not go forward with his plan, however, and he went into exile on 19 July 1983.African State and Society in the 1990s, pages 70-71. A month later, on 22 August 1983, Biya publicly accused Ahidjo of plotting a coup d'√©tat;\\"French Worried by Crisis in Cameroon, Close to Chad\\", Los Angeles Times, 25 August 1983, page B16. on the same occasion, he dismissed Maikano and another Ahidjo loyalist, Prime Minister Bello Bouba Maigari, from the government.\\"Gouvernement du 22 August 1983\\" , Cameroon government website . Gilbert Andze Tsoungui was appointed to replace Maikano. When dismissing Maikano and Bello Bouba, Biya did not explicitly accuse them of involvement in the coup plot, but the timing of their dismissal nevertheless implied that they were suspected of involvement.Michael G. Schatzberg and I. William Zartman, The Political Economy of Cameroon (1986), page 36. Ahidjo was tried in absentia for the 1983 coup plot and was sentenced to death by a tribunal on 28 February 1984; on that occasion, the tribunal proposed that Maikano and Bello Bouba should also be placed on trial.\\"Apr 1984 - Presidential elections-Cabinet changes-Trial of alleged coup plotters-Other internal developments\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 30, April, 1984 Cameroon, Page 32778. However, Biya halted the legal proceedings against them.Victor Julius Ngoh, Cameroon, 1884-1985: a hundred years of history (1988), page 315. Although Maikano was suspected of involvement in the April 1984 coup attempt,Joseph Takougang, \\"The Demise of Biya's New Deal in Cameroon, 1982-1992\\", in The Leadership Challenge in Africa: Cameroon under Paul Biya (2004), ed.

Maikano retired on 31 December 1993, but Biya called him out of retirement to serve as Government Delegate to the Urban Commune of Garoua in 1996. Biya appointed Maikano to that post following the victory of the opposition National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) in Garoua's municipal election; the atmosphere in the city was tense and Maikano, as the representative of the government, was greeted with hostility from the UNDP. According to Maikano, however, he was not interested in confrontation and intended only to improve the situation in Garoua through dialogue and his experience. During his tenure as Government Delegate, Maikano said that he remained on good terms with President Biya, although they rarely met. He credited Biya with helping him when he went to France for medical treatment. In his capacity as Government Delegate, Maikano was present for the inauguration of the American Corner at the Garoua Municipal Library on 13 December 2006 and expressed gratitude for the donation of materials and resources by the United States Embassy.\\"Ambassador Marquardt Dedicates American Corner in Garoua\\" , Website of the United States Embassy in Yaound√©, 2006. Maikano remained in his post as Government Delegate until a successor took office on 1 March 2009; on that occasion, he was praised and credited with restoring calm to the city. Maikano was then appointed as a Roving Ambassador by President Biya on 30 June 2009.Jean-Bruno Tagne, \\"Breaking News: Paul Biya modifie son Gouvernement !\\", Cameroon-info.net, 30 June 2009 . Personal life Maikano described himself as \\"a practicing Muslim but not fanatical\\" in a December 2003 interview: \\"I respect religious morality, that's all\\". He did not smoke or drink. As of 2003, he had one wife, to whom he had been married since around 1960, and no children. Regarding his career and lifestyle, he said in 2003 that \\"I've never had boundless ambitions. I've always led a modest life.\\" On 21 October 2011, Maikano died of an illness at his home in the Marouar√© neighborhood of Garoua; he was about 79 years old.

More specifically, as a man-in-the- browser banking trojan designed to transmit financial and personal information from a compromised computer to a third party for potential financial gain as well as report on computer configuration, communicate with a central server, and act as downloader for other malware. Clampi was first observed in 2007 affecting computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, Apple Mac operating system,it has been found that it has infected more than two dozen major banking institutions in the United States, including TD Bank, Chase, HSBC, Wells Fargo, PNC, and Bank of America. It is designed to steal users' sensitive data, such as Account login information and Banking Passwords. Clampi monitored over 4000 website URLs, effectively keylogging credentials and user information for not only bank and credit card websites, but also reported on utilities, market research firms, online casinos, and career websites. At its peak in the fall of 2009, a computer security professional stated that it was one of the largest and most professional thieving operations on the Internet, likely run by a Russian or eastern European syndicate. Detailed analysis Computer security analyst Nicolas Falliere claimed that \\"few threats have had us scratching our heads like Trojan.Clampi.\\" It was the first trojan found to be using a virtual machine called VMProtect to hide its instruction set. He remarked that the use of a virtual machine added weeks to the time required for programmers to disassemble and describe the threat and mechanism of action. He discovered it logged and transmitted personal financial information from a compromised computer to a third party for potential financial gain as well as reported on computer configuration, communicated with a central server, exploited Internet Explorer 8, set up a SOCKS proxy, and acted as downloader for other malware. The virus was sophisticated enough to hide behind firewalls and go undetected for long periods of time. A list of around 4,800 URLs were CRC encoded (similar to hashing). This was dictionary attacked against a list of common URLs in September 2009 to produce a partial list of known sites with some duplication and ambiguity. The source code has never been reported to be shared or sold online.  Operation  Clampi operates using packet sniffing, a method of reading network traffic, to determine when a user navigates to a banking website. The malware can then launch one of two different actions, depending on the variation. In its most popular form, Clampi will Form grab the webpage causing a man-in-the-middle attack. The Trojan uses Form grabbing to grab keystrokes before they can be encrypted by HTTPS. Clampi then sends the keystrokes to a Command & Control. This in turn causes a user's information to be stolen. The second method that Clampi has used is to allow the user to log into the webpage. Once the user is in, the malware will use the page information to extract the company's logo and site formatting. It will then create a pop-up page informing the user of updates to the system, and requesting additional information, such as social security numbers. Most banking institutions inform their users that they will never ask for this information as a way to defend against these types of attacks. Clampi has been modified to address this defense, and has begun asking users for the type of information asked as security questions, such as the user's mother's maiden name, in an attempt for the attacker to use this information to reset the password at a later time. Clampi also injects itself into other system processes, in an attempt to convert the host machine into a zombie, an unwilling member in a botnet. In order to maintain connection in the botnet, Clampi is coded with four domains, so if one goes down or loses communication, the Trojan can look for one of the others immediately.  Named modules  A list of components discovered through decryption of the executable in 2009: # SOCKS ‚Äì Configures a SOCKS proxy server attackers can use to log into your bank from your work/home internet connection. # PROT ‚Äì Steals PSTORE (protected storage for Internet Explorer) saved passwords # LOGGER ‚Äì Attempts to steal online credentials if the URL is on the list. # LOGGEREXT ‚Äì Aids in stealing online credentials for websites with enhanced security, ie HTTPS # SPREAD ‚Äì Spreads Clampi to computers in the network with shared directories. # ACCOUNTS ‚Äì Steals locally saved credentials for a variety of applications such as instant messaging and FTP clients. # INFO ‚Äì Gathers and sends general system information # KERNAL ‚Äì the eighth module refers to itself as Kernal while running inside the proprietary protected virtual appliance.

Dominik Florian Brunner (born 18 May 1959 in Stuttgart, died 12 September 2009 in Munich) was a German businessman. He was the CFO of Erlus AG, Germany‚Äôs largest roof tile manufacturer. He was killed in a fight which resulted from Brunner trying to protect a group of school children from attacks by teenagers. Biography Brunner was born to a family of entrepreneurs. His father, Oscar Brunner, was the finance manager of one of Germany's largest roof tile manufacturers, Erlus AG. After receiving his Abitur in Landshut, Brunner studied law at the University of Munich and worked in office positions in San Francisco and Paris. He followed in his father's footsteps when he took a leading position at Erlus AG. His fields of responsibility included finance, organization, personnel, law and purchases. In the 1990s, Brunner trained in kickboxing at Boxclub Straubing, but gave up the hobby after he noticed more and more young men arriving at the club to learn how to beat others.Claudia Keller, \\"Das Heldenbild Brunner wird unheimlich\\", Der Tagesspiegel, Die Zeit, 12 July 2010, retrieved 1 November 2012 Death On 12 September 2009, four school children were being threatened on a Munich S-Bahn train by two older teenagers, Markus Schiller and Sebastian Leibinger, who tried to rob and mug them. When Brunner and the young teens arrived at M√ºnchen Solln station, Brunner was punched and kicked over 20 times. He eventually died on-site due to a pre-existing heart condition.http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/0,1518,707012,00.html Schiller and Leibinger were charged with murder. In the court case, it was proven that Brunner became involved with the aim of protecting the school children, but questions were raised as to whether he died due to the brutal beating by the accused, and there were differing versions of how the fight between Brunner and the accused started. When the accused were threatening the children, Brunner asked them to stop, or he would call the police. The accused did not listen, so Brunner informed the police. He then asked the children to \\"stay away\\", took up a combat position and started to hit and fight the accused.

Mr Long went to Mr Lloyd's premises to see it. Mr Lloyd then said it could do 40 mph. On a trial run from Hampton Court to Sevenoaks, he said it did 11 miles to the gallon.

She was out of the mare Fiscal Year.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;. Yearly Report raced 10 times and won or placed in eight races, six of them stakes races. She is probably best known for her wins in the Grade II $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes on May 14, 2004, and the grade one Delaware Oaks.  Two-year-old season  Yearly Report was bought back by Mrs. John Mabee at Barretts Sale in May 2003 for $95,000. She debuted with a four-length score in a maiden special weight event at Hollywood Park in November. She earned $90,000 for her maiden victory. She also placed second to Silent Sighs in the state-bred California Breeders' Champion Stakes on December 27 at Santa Anita Park, losing by three lengths after a slow start in her initial stakes try.  Three-year-old season  As a three-year-old in 2004, Yearly Report won the grade two Santa Ynez Stakes run at Santa Anita Park in March. That race is considered a prep for the Filly Triple Crown, including the Kentucky Oaks. In her third career start for trainer Bob Baffert, the bay filly made her graded stakes debut. Coming from off the pace, she went seven furlongs on the dirt in a stakes-record 1:21 for her second win by 4-1/2 lengths.

Konk Studios In 1971, the Kinks left Pye Records for a five-album stint with RCA, who offered them a million-dollar advance. Ray and Dave Davies put this and money from recent hits like \\"Lola\\" towards a new studio of their own in Hornsey, a mile down the road from their home territory of Muswell Hill. In the past few years the group had mainly been recording at Morgan Studios, in Willesden, London. Albums recorded there included Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One (1970), Percy (1971), Muswell Hillbillies (1971) and Everybody's in Show- Biz (1972). The Kinks began recording full-time at the studio in about 1973. The group recorded the massive Preservation: Acts 1 & 2 (1973 & 1974) project at Konk, and it would remain their main studio until the group disbanded in 1996. It received a considerable amount of attention in 2008 when English Indie rock group the Kooks recorded an album there, entitled Konk (2008), which topped the UK albums chart in April that year. In 1989, Big Audio Dynamite recorded Megatop Phoenix, their final album together at Konk, and they considered the Kinks an inspiration in the album's liner notes. In 1991 the studios were used to record tracks for Rumor and Sigh, the sixth solo album by Richard Thompson. In July 2010, Ray Davies put the studio up for sale as a redevelopment property, presumably to be demolished. In June 2011 Davies announced a delay in the sale saying \\"It was up for sale but I've got another record I've got to do so we're debating what to do now. It's open for discussion\\". Since 2011, Konk has also hosted artist showings. In 2012, the Fall recorded tracks for its album Re-Mit at Konk Studios. Konk Records Konk the label was most prolific for a few years in the late seventies. It released a handful of unsuccessful 45s and LPs before it ceased in about 1976, with the departure of business manager Tony Dimitriades. Artists in the roster included a young Claire Hamill and Caf√© Society. Ray Davies secured the fledgling label a licensing deal with ABC Records. Davies later commented in a 1983 interview: \\\\- Ray Davies, Time Out, 17 December 1982Colis, John. \\"A Kink In Time\\", Time Out magazine, 17 December 1982 The label continued to release records off and on in the next few decades. Kinks re-releases are sometimes under the \\"Konk\\" name, although the distribution is handled by Sony Music's Legacy Recordings. The Kinks fell back to their old label when Columbia Records dropped them in 1994, releasing their last record together, To the Bone. To the Bone was recorded at Konk studios in front of a small invited audience, where the group performed some of their old classics, as well as two new compositions by Ray Davies. Rooms The Neve Room, in the Kinks' music video for \\"State of Confusion\\" The main room of Konk is the Neve Room, which was featured in the Kinks' 1983 \\"State of Confusion\\" music video. The other important room at Konk is the SSL room, opened in the early 1980s, used mainly for mixing and editing tracks. Clients Over time many artists have recorded at the studio.

It held that a person is deemed to contract with the person in front of them unless they can substantially prove that they instead intended to deal with someone else (see also Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson). Facts On 15 April 1918, a man named North entered Phillip's jewellery shop and said, \\"I am Sir George Bullough\\". He wrote a dud cheque for ¬£3000 to pay for some pearls and a ring. He said he lived in St. James's Square. Mr Phillips checked the phone directory and found there was someone there by that name. Mr Phillips asked if he would like to take the jewellery with him and Mr North said he would leave the pearls but take the ring 'for his wife's birthday tomorrow'. Mr North then pawned the ring to Brooks Ltd for ¬£350. When the false cheque was dishonoured, Phillips sued Brooks Ltd to get the ring back. Note that there are conflicting reports showing that Mr North identified himself after the ring was sold, as Viscount Haldane said in Lake v Simmons, but others say that North identified himself straight away. Judgment The earlier judgement of Cundy v Lindsay had established that contracts could be automatically void for mistake to identity. Where this is the case, title does not pass to the fraudulent buyer, and the third party loses out in the entirety. This principle is different where parties contract face to face; Horridge J stated: This outcome can be explained by putting it as such: Mr Phillips hoped he was contracting with Sir George Bullough, but in reality he agreed to contract with whoever came into his shop, taking a risk that he was not who he said he was. It had the mere effect of making the contract voidable for fraud, meaning that title passed to the rogue and subsequently to the third party buyer: See also *English contract law *Misrepresentation *Mistake in English contract law *Nemo dat quod non habet * Cundy v Lindsay * Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson References Category:English mistake case law Category:English misrepresentation case law Category:High Court of Justice cases Category:1919 in case law Category:1919 in British law ","title":"Phillips v Brooks Ltd"},{"id":"24600983","text":"Moosa Moolla (born 1934) is an Indian South African activist and diplomat. A member of the African National Congress, Moolla was arrested and eventually found not guilty in the 1956 Treason Trial. In 1961, he was arrested and tried for incitement at the time of the May 1961 stay-at-home protest. In May 1963, he was arrested under the 90-day law. On 11 August 1963, Moolla and others escaped prison by bribing a young guard. He later served as the ANC representative to Asia while living in exile in India.Moosa Moolla at SA History Following independence, he became the first South African ambassador to Iran. Ebrahim Arrives in Iran for Working Group Meeting BuaNews via AllAfrica.com, 27 September 2009 Background  Moosa ‚ÄúMosie‚Äù Moolla was born in the small, (then) western Transvaal town of Christiana on 12 June 1934 where his father ran a successful import-export business. The family was forced to relocate to Bloemhof, a nearby town, following the Great Depression of the 1930s. Mosie did his primary schooling in Bloemhof. Since there were no high schools catering for blacks, Mosie was forced to move to Johannesburg in 1949 to pursue his secondary education. Political life The developments in national and international politics during this period sparked Mosie‚Äôs interest in current affairs. Boarding with a Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) stalwart, Mrs Ouma Bhayat, and surrounded by other TIC activists such as Dr Vallabh Jaga, Dr Zainab Asvat and Dr Abdulhaq Patel, Mosie was recruited into the newly launched Transvaal Indian Youth Congress (TIYC). The very first campaign he actively participated in was the 1950 May Day strike, in protest of the Suppression of Communism Act. During this period the Picasso Club was formed for the purposes of writing political slogans on public walls. Among its members were Mosie, Ahmed Kathrada, Babla Saloojee, Faried Adams and Solly Esakjee. Mosie quickly moved up the ranks of the youth movement through actively participating in activities of the TIYC by silk-screening and putting up posters, writing and distributing leaflets. He was elected to the organisation‚Äôs executive committee and then as the joint honorary secretary and finally as Chair, a position he held for nearly a decade. In his matriculation year, 1952, Mosie participated in the Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws and was imprisoned for close to a month. Due to his detention, Mosie was expelled and could not write his matriculation examinations. At the beginning of the campaign for the Congress of the People (COP), the Congress movement requested Mosie to leave his administrative job in a manufacturing company in order to serve full time on the Secretariat of the National Action Council of the COP. Members of the Secretariat such as Walter Sisulu, Joe Slovo, Rusty Bernstein and Yusuf Cachalia were banned under the Suppression of Communism Act. It therefore became Mosie‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that all decisions of the Secretariat were effectively conveyed to all provincial and regional committees of the National Action Council. He served in this capacity until the culmination of the COP campaign with the adoption of the Freedom Charter in Kliptown on 25 and 26 June 1955. Mosie was later elected onto the executive of the TIC and also served as its full-time organiser. In December 1956 Mosie, along with 155 others, was arrested on the charge of high treason. He also recalls the support and acts of solidarity with the accused. Money for the bail was raised within hours. The women provided two meals everyday for five years, for all the accused, especially Mrs Thayanagie Pillay and Dr Zainab Asvat. Mosie was one of thirty - including Nelson Mandela, Helen Joseph, Ahmed Kathrada and Walter Sisulu - to stand trial for the entire period until 1961. Despite the prosecutors believing that they had a strong chance of conviction, they were all acquitted in March 1961, after being on trial for five years. On 10 May 1963 Mosie was amongst the first to be detained under the newly promulgated 90-day detention law. He was held in solitary confinement at Marshall Square Police Station. He later escaped from the police station along with Abdulhay Jassat, Harold Wolpe and Arthur Goldreich. Mosie then left the country illegally, and made his way to Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika (now Tanzania) which housed the exiled leadership of the African National Congress (ANC). In 1964 Mosie joined Umkhonto we Sizwe and in 1965 was sent for a year to Odessa in the then-Soviet Union for military training. His was the second unit to be sent to Odessa and his group included Josiah Jele (who served on the ANC‚Äôs National Executive Committee [NEC]), Peter Tladi and Jacqueline Molefe who, after 1994, became a major general in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). In 1966, after Odessa, Mosie went to Moscow for a six-month stint in intelligence training. On his return to Dar es Salaam, he continued his work within the ANC‚Äôs Department of Publicity and Information as editor of the ANC‚Äôs news journal Spotlight on South Africa. From the time of his escape in 1963 until 1968 the apartheid state denied Mosie‚Äôs wife, Zubeida, and their children, Tasneem and Azaad, passports. Finally in 1968, they were granted passports and travelled by train to Lusaka, Zambia. Mosie joined them for a few days at Tunduma, at the Tanzania-Zambia border. This was the first time that Mosie saw his son, who was born two months after he fled the country. Azaad was five years old, and his daughter, Tasneem was six years old. After the brief reunion Mosie returned to Dar es Salaam and Zubeida to Lusaka with the children. Zubeida, could not obtain a work permit in Zambia, and was forced to send the children back to South Africa to live with her parents because she could not support them. This separation was very painful for all of them. In 1969 Mosie was deployed to Bombay to work amongst South African students studying in India. The ANC‚Äôs Asian mission was located in New Delhi with Mendi Msimang as its chief representative and Molvi Cachalia as the deputy chief representative. In 1971 Molvi Cachalia retired and Mosie was appointed in his place. In 1972 Mendi was transferred to Tanzania and Mosie took over as chief representative. In 1978, Mosie was sent to head the ANC‚Äôs Egypt and Middle East mission. He was also concurrently the ANC representative to the Afro-Asian People‚Äôs Solidarity Organisation (AAPSO). In 1982 he was reposted to New Delhi. In November 1989 he was deployed as the ANC representative to the World Peace Council and had to relocate to Helsinki, Finland. In 1978, Moolla was posted to Cairo as ANC Chief Representative in Egypt and the Middle East and concurrently as ANC representative on the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro- Asian Peoples Solidarity Organisation. In December 1990, after 28 years in exile, Mosie returned to South Africa. He was employed by the ANC‚Äôs Department of International Affairs based in Shell House. In 1991 he was elected as secretary of the TIC and served as a member of the TIC/NIC delegation to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). In 1995, President Mandela appointed Mosie as the South African ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran. He held the post until 1999. From June 2000 until 2004 Mosie was appointed as high commissioner to Pakistan. Zubeida (nee Saloojee), Mosie‚Äôs wife and life-long partner passed away on 3 April 2008. They were married for close to 47 years. Besides Tasneem and Azaad, he has another son, Afzal, who was born in New Delhi, India in 1972. Nelson Mandela gave his daughter, Tasneem, her middle name Nobandla, which means ‚Äúshe of the masses‚Äù. In 2013 the South African Government conferred The Order of Luthuli in Silver on Moosa (Mosie) Moolla for his dauntless and excellent work in the liberation movement often at great risk to his life and for representing the interests of the liberation movement and South Africa in the international community.

Lagunillas is known region-wide as an enchanting place with red-colored dirt roads and adobe houses with wooden accents contrasting a solid dark green forest and the silhouette of the Cerro El Huehuent√≥n. Toponymics Lagunillas (lah-gun-nee-yahs) in Spanish means \\"small lakes\\". The word is a combination of the noun laguna, meaning \\"lake\\", and the suffix illa which means \\"small\\". History Lagunillas was probably founded by a group of settlers who, when searching for farmland, found small freshwater lakes. The town is atop a mesa surrounded by forests of oak and pine trees. The town is still surrounded by the Sierra de Quila, whose beauty symbolizes untouched nature. The population of Lagunillas has had a steady decline due to its rural location, it is currently 106 as of 2010. Economy During the peach harvest in Lagunillas, many residents from adjacent towns come to pick peaches for no cost, due to the hospitality of Lagunillas' residents. Maize and agave are farmed, but not in a significant quantity. Orchards of peaches and cherries are the town's agricultural symbol.

Biography For the first nineteen years of her life, Nina Rautio lived in Petrozavodsk (Republic of Karelia, Russia). To begin with, she graduated as a pianist from the Petrozavodsk School of Music, and then completed a Dual Degree, studying theory and singing (the latter with Z.I. Larkina) ‚Äì achieving distinction in both disciplines ‚Äì at the K.E. Rautio Music College. In 1983 she graduated from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory (vocal class of E.A. Abrosimova) as a spinto soprano. During her studies at the conservatoire, Nina performed the role of Violetta (\\"La Traviata\\") at the Conservatoire Opera Studio. She was the winner of the Second Prize at the Villa-Lobos Competition in Rio de Janeiro in 1983, as well as receiving the Fourth Prize in the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1986. She began her operatic career in earnest in 1984, performing a number of leading roles as part of the Mikhaylovsky Theatre (formerly the Maly Opera Theatre) in St. Petersburg.–°–æ–ª–∏—Å—Ç—ã –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¢–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–∞ –û–ø–µ—Ä—ã –∏ –ë–∞–ª–µ—Ç–∞ –∏–º. –ú.–ü.–ú—É—Å–æ—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ (–±—ã–≤—à—ã–π '–ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π' –∏ '–ú–∞–ª—ã–π –û–ø–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π') After competing in the Tchaikovsky Competition she was invited to join the Bolshoi Theatre company where, starting in January 1987, she became one of its leading sopranos, as well as performing in many renowned concert halls in Moscow and St. Petersburg. She made numerous radio and State Television appearances. Between 1987 and 1993, Nina Rautio was the Prima Donna of choice for a wide variety of roles, including those of Maria (Tchaikovsky's \\"Mazeppa\\", dir. S.F. Bondarchuk) and Amelia (Verdi's \\"Un Ballo in Maschera\\", dir. S.A. Stein) in 1987; Elisabeth of Valois (Verdi's \\"Don Carlos\\", dir. I.M. Tumanov) and Santuzza (Mascagni's \\"Cavalleria Rusticana\\", dir. S.A. Stein) in 1988; Tatyana (Tchaikovsky's \\"Eugene Onegin\\", dir. B.A. Pokrovsky) and Lisa (Tchaikovsky's \\"The Queen of Spades\\", dir. Baratov) in 1989; Oksana (Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Christmas Eve\\", dir. A.B. Tittel) in 1990; and Joan (Tchaikovsky's \\"Maid of Orleans\\", dir. B.A. Pokrovsky) in 1992 and 1993, as well as many others. One of the directors of the Bolshoi company, V.G. Milkov, offered this appraisal of Nina Rautio's talent: \\"She wields a voice possessed of the most radiant timbre, imbued with a wide palette of shades and hues, all underpinned by an acting ability of great resolve and persuasion\\". Renowned Russian music critic A.E. Hripin noted that \\"any classification of this soprano can only be tentative and provisional, for she combines all the colours and sounds feasible for a female voice, from the velvety contralto timbre of the lower register to the brilliant coloratura at the high end of her diapason. Her vocal range is unique ‚Äì from Es3 to Es6. The lower, \\"chest\\" register envelops the ear, it's dense and resonant. The top is remarkable for its clear, silvery penetration. She combines tremendous virtuosity with incredible power...\\" (\\"SK\\", 06/10/1990). At the end of the 1980s Nina Rautio collaborated with M.V. Yurovsky's \\"Forum\\" theatre on a revival of Bortniansky's opera \\"Quinto Fabio\\", culminating in her taking on the role of priestess Fausta in the first ever performances of the opera in Russia (1990). She first sang in the West in 1991 when she travelled to the Metropolitan Opera, New York, and the Edinburgh festival with the Bolshoi Company. She was immediately acclaimed as an artist of exceptional talent and invited by the La Scala Theatre to act as an understudy for the title role of Puccini's \\"Manon Lescaut\\" in February 1992. After only a few rehearsals, the conductor, Lorin Maazel, promoted her to the premiere cast, as well as inviting her to record the role with Sony Classical. The performances and the recording met with tremendous acclaim, and this turn of events served as the catalyst that established the young soprano's reputation on the international stage. Later the same year, again at La Scala, Nina Rautio took on the role of Elisabeth of Valois in Verdi's \\"Don Carlos\\" (under the baton of Riccardo Muti), and sang the soprano solo in Jan√°ƒçek's \\"Glagolitic Mass\\" under Riccardo Chailly. After the successful La Scala debut, Nina began a long and fruitful creative partnership with some of the most celebrated conductors of recent times, including Lorin Maazel (with whom she toured across Europe, together with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, throughout 1992, including the World Exposition in Seville) and Riccardo Chailly (the latter having invited her to perform as a soloist with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra). Nina Rautio was held in very high regard by Luciano Pavarotti, who performed with her in numerous productions in the 1990s, including \\"Don Carlos\\", \\"Un Ballo in Maschera\\", \\"Manon Lescaut\\", \\"Andrea Chenier\\", Verdi's Requiem Mass, amongst others. In the early 1990s Nina relocated to London and has since performed across the world. She made many critically acclaimed appearances on the stage of the Royal Opera House, London, as Amelia (\\"Un Ballo in maschera\\"), as the eponymous heroine in \\"Aida\\", Desdemona in \\"Othello\\" (all under Daniele Gatti), as well as Abigaille in Verdi's \\"Nabucco\\"; performed \\"Aida\\" with Daniel Oren at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma; took on the title roles in \\"Tosca\\" and \\"Aida\\" for the New York Metropolitan Opera productions;OPERA REVIEW; Russian Makes Met Debut In Season's First 'Aida, New York Times sang the role of Lisa in Opera Bastille's production of \\"The Queen of Spades\\" (dir.

Nina Rautio has performed over twenty leading operatic roles, which includedLady Macbeth (\\"Macbeth\\", Verdi);Leonora (\\"Il Trovatore\\", Verdi);Mathilde (\\"William Tell\\", Rossini);Donna Anna (\\"Don Giovanni\\", Mozart). Nina made numerous appearances at the Savonlinna Opera Festival in Finnland, reprising the role of Aida, as well as starring as a soloist in gala performances. She participated in the Choregies d'Orange, France, as Desdemona (\\"Othello), and in the Salzburg Festival, singing the soprano solo in Mahler's Second Symphony ‚Äì on both occasions the conductor was Lorin Maazel. Back in Russia, Nina Rautio has been involved in a number of projects, such as the \\"Golden Voices of the Opera\\"'–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç—ã–µ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Å–∞ –º–∏—Ä–∞ –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ' –ö–æ–Ω—Ü–µ—Ä—Ç –ù–∏–Ω—ã –†–∞—É—Ç–∏–æ festival in Moscow; the \\"Stars of the Operatic Stage\\" concerts, Moscow; the International M.D. Mikhailov Opera Festival in Chebokhsary;XIV —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –æ–ø–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—å –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–∞ –î–æ—Ä–º–∏–¥–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤–∏—á–∞ –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∞ the \\"Aliabyevskaya Musikalnaya Osen\\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—å \\"–ê–ª—è–±—å–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –æ—Å–µ–Ω—å\\" festival, amongst a number of others.

Sviridov, etc. In 1990, in a concert celebrating the 75th birthday of a renowned Russian composer Sviridov, Nina performed his entire \\"Cast-off Russia\\" lieder cycle (words by Sergei Yesenin), accompanied by E.P. Savelyeva on the piano.

Mr Caldwell told the police and the Automobile Association straight away. Mr Norris sold the car to some dealers, who sold it on, and it was sold on again and again to Car and Universal Finance Ltd. They bought the car in good faith without any notice. The question was whether Caldwell had validly rescinded before the car was acquired by a bona fide purchaser for value without notice? Judgment=High Court Lord Denning MR (sitting in the Queen‚Äôs Bench) said the contract was validly rescinded. It was so without communication, but through an unequivocal act of election, demonstrating Caldwell no longer wished to be bound. Court of Appeal Seller LJ, on appeal said the ‚Äògeneral rule, no doubt, is that where a party is entitled to rescind a contract and wishes to do so the contract subsists until the opposing party is informed that the contract has been rescinded. He noted that just because, ‚Äòanother innocent party or parties may suffer does not in my view of the matter justify imposing on a defrauded seller an impossible task.‚Äô Upjohn LJ said if a party absconds and makes communication of rescission impossible, he cannot insist on his right to be made aware. ‚ÄòI think that the law must allow the innocent party to exercise his right of rescission otherwise than by communication or repossession.‚Äô Davies LJ noted the old maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia (the law does not compel the impossible).

He was associated with the monarchist tendency within the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista and was critical of the Falange. Conspiracies An early supporter of Jos√© Sanjurjo, he had been involved in his failed 1932 rebellion, although there was no adequate proof to bring prosecution.Paul Preston, Franco, London, 1995, p. 91 Following the uprising he became involved in attempting to secretly recruit senior officers for future action and one of those he targeted was his friend Francisco Franco. He became a founder member of the Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola and kept the group in touch with the conspiracies already undertaken by aviator Juan Antonio Ansaldo and officer Juan Vig√≥n.Preston, Franco, p. 92 As a consequence of his wide circle of contacts he became part of the conspiratorial group of officers around Franco and Emilio Mola.Preston, Franco, p. 122 He was vital to Franco personally as he was the general's link man to the UME.Preston, Franco, p. 110 In 1934, he was at the centre of a coup plot when plans were put in place for Ansaldo to fly General Sanjurjo back from exile in Portugal. The plan was for Sanjurjo to link up with Juan Yag√ºe and to lead a coup. However whilst the plotters waited at philologist Pedro Sainz Rodr√≠guez's house word came through from Franco that the right was not yet ready and for the plan to be aborted.Preston, Franco, p. 107 Galarza however remained a central figure in the conspiracies and, based as he was in the War Ministry in Madrid, he was central in passing messages between the generals in the immediate run-up to the Spanish Civil War.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, Harmondsworth, 1971, p. 197 Government career Galarza's leading role in plotting the uprising and his good personal relationship with Franco ensured that he was able to secure government office after the civil war. He initially served as the under-secretary of the Presidencia del Gobierno and in this role he was instrumental in keeping Franco in touch with the inner workings of government.Preston, Franco, p. 431 On 5 May 1941, he was appointed Interior Minister as Franco moved to check the growing influence of Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er by adding leading anti-Falangists like Galarza to the cabinet.Preston, Franco, pp. 432-3 Following his appointment, Galarza was the subject of numerous attacks in the Falangist press although he hit back by dismissing all the Falangist under-secretaries in his department, most notably Dionisio Ridruejo who had written a particularly scathing article against him.Preston, Franco, p. 433 However it was Galarza's anti-Falangism that also proved his undoing as his close support of Jos√© Enrique Varela led to his dismissal in 1942. Franco feared the growing power of Varela who came to the fore as an opponent of Falangism when he resigned after Falangists attacked monarchists at the Basilica of Bego√±a, and he sought to remove his supporters, including Galarza, from positions of influence.Preston, Franco, p. 468 Later years Following his dismissal from the cabinet, Galarza became associated with a group of monarchist dissidents on the fringes of Spain's political elite. In June 1943, he was one of a number of leading monarchists to lend their name to a manifesto sent to Franco calling on him to settle the constitutional questions by immediately restoring the monarchy. The plan was rejected however, and Galarza was one of the signatories to be dismissed from the Cortes Generales for their involvement.Preston, Franco, p. 492 References Category:1882 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Government ministers during the Francoist dictatorship Category:Spanish colonels Category:Spanish monarchists Category:People from El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a Category:Interior ministers of Spain ","title":"Valent√≠n Galarza Morante"},{"id":"24601342","text":"Schinia cumatilis, or the silver-banded gem, is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

In the summer of 1955 \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\" was remade as the debut disc by comedy musical act Lillian Briggs resulting in an expedient cover version by veteran vocalist Georgia Gibbs: producers Hugo & Luigi had Gibbs fly in from her Massachusetts home to New York City on Wednesday 3 August 1955 to cut \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\" that same afternoon; New York City disc jockeys were provided with acetates of the Gibbs' version by the following morning with regular jockey copies being shipped out Friday 5 August 1955.Billboard vol 67 #33 (13 August 1955) p.22 Neither version of the song would reach the Top Ten: Gibbs' version had the higher chart peak at #14 but it was the rough voiced Briggs - whose version peaked at #18 - who had the million seller. Ellie Greenwich, who as a teenager saw Lillian Briggs sing her hit at Alan Freed's rock and roll shows, chose \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\" as the song to launch her '60s career as a solo recording artist. Produced by Bob Crewe, Greenwich's version reached #83 in the spring of 1967 marking her only US chart appearance as a recording artist (apart from her singles with The Raindrops). She included the song on her 1968 debut solo album Ellie Greenwich Composes, Pruduces and Sings. In the UK Annie Ross - John Hendricks' future co-partner in Lambert, Hendricks & Ross - had an October 1955 single release of \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\" recorded with Tony Crombie & His Orchestra: neither this disc nor a 1956 UK single release of \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\" by Don Lang charted. The song became a UK Top 40 hit in the autumn of 1968 via a recording by Billie Davis. Produced by Ready Steady Go! co-host Michael Aldred and arranged by Mike Vickers, Davis' version featured a chorale comprising Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Kay Garner, Doris Troy and the Moody Blues. The single's failure to rise no higher than #33 is attributable to a strike at the Decca processing plant, which stopped the pressing of discs. The song was also banned, which limited airplay; in February 1956, the British music magazine NME reported that Ross's version of the song was banned by the BBC due to the lyric \\"Come upstairs and have some loving\\". In November 1970 the Jyve Fyve reached #50 R&B; with their remake of \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\". The song has also been recorded by Jimmy and the Mustangs, Colin James, Lindisfarne, Natasha England, Janis Siegel, and Leslie Uggams. Pittsburgh Courier 4 March 1967 \\"Wax Works\\" by Hazel Garland p.13 A Finnish rendering - \\"Armaani S√§ Silloin Oisit\\" - was recorded by Wiola Talvikki. It was also a hit for Chinese singer Grace Chang who performed the song in both Chinese (ÊàëË¶Å‰Ω†ÁöÑÁà± \\"Wo Yao Ni de Ai\\") and English in the late 1950s. There was another rendition of the song in a classic 1958 Tamil movie Uthama puthiran entitled Yaaradi Ni Mohini. The song was turned into the title song of the Italian TV show ‚ÄúCanzonissima‚Äù in 1960, with the title ‚ÄúTu lei lui voi noi‚Äù, sang by Wilma De Angelis and Johnny Dorelli.

Calhoun. William James Calhoun (October 5, 1848 ‚Äì September 19, 1916)The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, December 6, 1909Evening Star, September 20, 1916 was an American attorney, government official, and friend of President William McKinley. A noted corporation lawyer, Calhoun wrote a report that helped persuade McKinley to enter the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, served as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission and later served as a special envoy to China. Early life Calhoun was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Robert Calhoun and the former Sarah Knox. After attending public school, the boy was sent to the Poland Seminary, where he became great friends with the young William McKinley, also a student there. The Calhouns moved to Ohio, where William worked on a farm. In 1864, the 16-year-old enlisted in the 19th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He served there through the end of the war, seeing action in Georgia, and later serving in Tennessee and Texas. He was still under 18 when he was mustered out. Early career Calhoun moved to Danville, Illinois, where he obtained a position as a schoolteacher, studying law at night. He was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1873, and practiced law in Danville until 1898, gaining fame for his brilliance and eloquence as a criminal defense attorney. In 1882, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Republican, where he served one term. Governmental career In 1897, Calhoun's friend, William McKinley, who had recently been sworn in as President, appointed him as special counsel to US Consul General in Cuba Fitzhugh Lee, to investigate the death of Dr. Ricardo Ruiz, a dentist and naturalized American citizen who died in a Cuban jail after his arrest for sabotage. His report led McKinley to conclude that war against Spain was advisable. On March 9, 1898, McKinley appointed Calhoun as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission for a six-year term. The Senate confirmed Calhoun's nomination the following day, and he was sworn in on March 21. He resigned on September 30, 1899 and was succeeded by fellow Illinois Republican Joseph W. Fifer. Calhoun returned to the practice of law, but as a corporation lawyer in Chicago.Men of Affairs: a gallery of cartoon portraits, Chicago Evening Post, 1906; page 121. He represented such corporations as the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and served as a director of the Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to go to Venezuela and resolve the dispute between Venezuelan President Cipriano Castro and foreign powers. Calhoun was successful in this task. In 1909, President William Howard Taft appointed Calhoun as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China. He served there until 1913. Present in China during the Xinhai Revolution, he arranged for President Taft to send Marines to China to protect the legation the following year. In 1913, he resigned, and returned to Chicago, where his knowledge of China made him much in demand as a trade adviser. In early 1916, Calhoun suffered a paralyzing stroke, and he died at his home in Chicago on September 19, 1916.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.World Council of Churches: Church of Greece. Retrieved: 28 November 2013. By the 4th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence. Under Ottoman rule, up to \\"6,000 Greek clergymen, ca. 100 Bishops, and 11 Patriarchs knew the Ottoman sword\\".Christodoulos (Paraskevaides) of Athens.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821‚Äì28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous. The cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.Charalambos K.

It was built under orders of William the Silent and completed in 1593. Its original purpose was to control the only road between Germany and the city of Groningen, which was controlled by the Spaniards during the time of the Eighty Years' War. After experiencing its final battle in 1672, the Fort continued to serve in the defensive network on the German border until it was finally given up in 1851 and converted into a village. Fort Bourtange currently serves as a historical museum. History At the start of the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648), the Spaniards had control over Groningen and the passage to Germany through a marshy area. William, the instigator of the Dutch Revolt, deemed it necessary to seize control of the link between Groningen and Germany. He decided to have a fortification built in the Bourtange passage. A fort was completed in 1593, with a network of canals and lakes which were used as moats. Soon after its construction, Spanish forces from Groningen besieged it, though the attack ended in failure.A Universal history pg. 455 Fort Bourtange faced another siege in 1672 against invading forces of the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster, France's German ally in the Franco- Dutch War. After capturing 18 cities and towns in the northern Netherlands, they demanded that the Fort be surrendered. The fort's governor, Captain Protts, refused, and the M√ºnsters replied with a frontal assault. Thanks to the surrounding marshes and the time-tested fortifications, the invading army was repelled successfully.Netherlands, Pat Seward, Sunandini Arora Lal, pg. 23 After its conversion into a village in 1851, living conditions began to deteriorate. Over 100 years later in 1960, the local government decided to stop the decline by restoring the old Fort to its 1740‚Äì50 appearance and converting into a historical museum.

Marx himself saw primitive communism as the original hunter-gatherer state of humankind. For Marx, only after humanity was capable of producing surplus did private property develop.  Classical period  The idea of a classless and stateless society based on communal ownership of property and wealth also stretches far back in Western thought long before The Communist Manifesto. There are scholars who have traced communist ideas back to ancient times, particularly in the work of Pythagoras and Plato. Followers of Pythagoras, for instance, lived in one building and held their property in common because the philosopher taught the absolute equality of property with all worldly possessions being brought into a common store. It is argued that Plato's Republic described in great detail a communist-dominated society wherein power is delegated in the hands of intelligent philosopher or military guardian class and rejected the concept of family and private property. In a social order divided into warrior-kings and the Homeric demos of craftsmen and peasants, Plato conceived an ideal Greek city-state without any form of capitalism and commercialism with business enterprise, political plurality, and working-class unrest considered as evils that must be abolished. While Plato's vision cannot be considered a precursor of communist thinking, his utopian speculations that are shared by other utopian thinkers later on.  Religious communism  There are those who view that the early Christian Church, such as that one described in the Acts of the Apostles (see Christian communism), was an early form of communism. The view is that communism was just Christianity in practice and Jesus Christ as the first communist. This link was highlighted in one of Marx's early writings which stated: \\"As Christ is the intermediary unto whom man unburdens all his divinity, all his religious bonds, so the state is the mediator unto which he transfers all his Godlessness, all his human liberty\\". Furthermore, the Marxist ethos that aims for unity reflects the Christian universalist teaching that humankind is one and that there is only one god who does not discriminate among people. Pre- Marxist communism was also present in the attempts to establish communistic societies such as those made by the Essenes and by the Judean desert sect. Furthermore, Thomas M√ºntzer led a large Anabaptist communist movement during the German Peasants' War.  Medieval period  Peter Kropotkin argued that the elements of mutual aid and mutual defense expressed in the medieval commune and its guild system were the same sentiments of collective self- defense apparent in modern communism and socialism.  Early modern period  In the 16th century, English writer Sir Thomas More portrayed a society based on common ownership of property in his treatise Utopia, whose leaders administered it through the application of reason. Several groupings in the English Civil War supported this idea, but especially the Diggers, who espoused clear communistic yet agrarian ideals.E.g. \\"That we may work in righteousness, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Treasury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the Land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation. Not Inclosing any part into any particular hand, but all as one man, working together, and feeding together as Sons of one Father, members of one Family; not one Lording over another, but all looking upon each other, as equals in the Creation;\\" in The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men Oliver Cromwell and the Grandees' attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile. Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the Enlightenment era of the 18th century through such thinkers as the deeply religious Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Raised a Calvinist, Rousseau was influenced by the Jansenist movement within the Roman Catholic Church. The Jansenist movement originated from the most orthodox Roman Catholic bishops who tried to reform the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century to stop secularization and Protestantism. One of the main Jansenist aims was democratizing to stop the aristocratic corruption at the top of the Church hierarchy. Utopian socialist writers such as Robert Owen are also sometimes regarded as communists.  Age of Revolution  Maximilien Robespierre and his Reign of Terror, aimed at exterminating the nobility and conservatives, was admired among some communists. In his turn, Robespierre was a great admirer of Rousseau. Francois Babeuf has both been described as an anarchist and communist by later scholars to describe his ideas. The word \\"communism\\" was first used in English by Goodwyn Barmby in a conversation with those he described as the \\"disciples of Babeuf\\". He has been called \\"The First Revolutionary Communist.\\" The Shakers of the 18th century under Joseph Meacham developed and practiced their own form of communalism, as a sort of religious communism, where property had been made a \\"consecrated whole\\" in each Shaker community. The participants of the Taiping Rebellion, who founded the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, are viewed by the Communist Party of China as proto- communists.Daniel Little, Marx and the Taipings (2009) The Communards and the Paris Commune are often seen as proto-communists, and had significant influence on the ideas of Karl Marx, who described it as an example of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\".  Non-European communism  Lewis Henry Morgan's descriptions of \\"communism in living\\" as practised by the Iroquois Nation of North America.Morgan, L. H. 1881. Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press. This was a primary inspiration for Marx and Engel's description of primitive communism, and has led to some believing that early communist-like societies also existed outside of Europe, in Native American society and other pre-Colonized societies in the Western hemisphere. Primitive communism meaning societies that practiced economic cooperation among the members of their tribes, where almost every member of a tribe had his or her own contribution to society and land and natural resources would often be shared peacefully among the tribe. Some such tribes in North America and South America still existed well into the 20th century. The Chachapoya culture indicated a egalitarian non- hierarchical society through a lack of archaeological evidence and a lack of power expressing architecture that would be expected for societal leaders such as royalty or aristocracy.  Karl Marx and the contemporary age  Marx saw communism as the original state of mankind from which it rose through classical society and then feudalism to its current state of capitalism. He proposed that the next step in social evolution would be a return to communism. In its contemporary form, communism grew out of the workers' movement of 19th-century Europe. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socialist critics blamed capitalism for creating a class of poor, urban factory workers who toiled under harsh conditions and for widening the gulf between rich and poor.

Levenson (February 15, 1914 ‚Äì August 12, 2007) was a cryptographer, United States Army officer and NSA official who worked on the Japanese J19 and the German Enigma codes. Biography Arthur J. Levenson was born in Brooklyn, New York. He earned a B.S. in Mathematics from the City College of New York. He did graduate work in mathematics at New York University and Columbia University. He attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. Mr. Levenson was a graduate of the National War College. Mr. Levenson was buried with full military honors on December 7, 2007, at Arlington National Cemetery. World War II Service At the beginning of World War II, the Army called Mr. Levenson to active duty from the Enlisted Reserve Corps. He was approved for Signal Corps Officer Candidate School at Fort Monmouth Levenson was selected by Major William P. Bundy to be a member of the 6811th Signal Company. The 6811th Signal joined the British wartime code breaking organization at Bletchley Park in Britain. At Bletchley Park, Levenson worked against both the ENIGMA and TUNNY German cipher machines in the famous Hut 6. Levenson developed a friendship with British cryptanalysts Alan Turing and Hugh Alexander. After V-E Day, Levenson was sent with a group of British and American officers to Germany, assigned to track down German cipher equipment and to locate and interrogate German cryptanalysts. In his obituary in The Washington Post, an anecdote from his wartime service showed his operational contribution: > In a 1999 PBS documentary about the decoding project, Mr. Levenson said the > team at Bletchley sometimes deciphered the German messages before German > forces in the field could read them. \\"If it was something hot,\\" he said, > \\"it'd get out in the field before the German commander got his.\\" In one > case, Mr. Levenson said, the team decoded a message from German military > leader Erwin Rommel and determined that German tanks were converging at a > spot in Normandy where U.S. paratroopers were planning to jump. \\"They were > going to drop one of the airborne divisions right on top of a German tank > division,\\" Mr. Levenson said in the documentary. \\"They would have been > massacred.\\" At the last moment, plans were changed, and the paratroopers > averted disaster. National Security Agency After completing his service overseas, he remained in the cryptologic business as a civilian with the organizations that eventually evolved into the National Security Agency. He was a member and subsequently Chief of the Technical Consultants Group, the prestigious cryptanalytic organization where the most difficult problems were attacked. During that period he initiated the program for sending out selected NSA working mathematicians to participate in the recruitment of promising college math students-a program that greatly enhanced the quality of the growing NSA professional work force. When the Office of Production in NSA was re- structured to better focus its attacks he was selected to organize and serve as the first Chief of ADVA, an organization dedicated to the exploitation of Soviet high-grade encryption systems. He led the design and implementation of the technical attack team. He took the lead in procuring high-level government support for the project from experts like William O. Baker, head of the Bell Laboratories and longtime member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Levenson became chief of A Group, the major NSA organization devoted to analyzing Soviet Bloc communications. Under his leadership, A group was refocused to enhance the timeliness of its Signals Intelligence reporting to the intelligence community. Before he retired in December 1973, Levenson served as Chief of the Machine Processing Organization, responsible for the maintenance and operation of the large NSA facility which housed both commercial off- the-shelf computers and highly sophisticated special purpose machines. Levenson introduced computer management structure professionals from private industry opening up the organization to innovation from outside of the elite cryptologic workforce. Levenson retired with 32 years of Agency service. Data Encryption Standard In 1976, after retiring from NSA, Levenson and NSA and NBS representatives met with the Stanford University cryptography team which had publicly criticized NSA's proposed Data Encryption Standard, DES, as being too easy to crack. In this meeting with Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, and Paul Baran, he tried to convince the critics that \\"56 [bits] is quite adequate\\", because (among other reasons) brute force attack would never be the weakest link in the security of systems that used DES. NSA succeeded in getting broad adoption of 56-bit DES, particularly in the financial industry. This allowed NSA and other countries to decipher most of the world's financial transactions, until the EFF DES cracker convinced banks to switch to stronger ciphers in 1998. Family He was married for 62 years to Marjorie West Levenson of Washington. He had three children, David West Levenson of Warren, N.J., Sarah Stromeyer of Austin and Rebecca Levenson Smith of Silver Spring; and two grandchildren. Awards Levenson was awarded the NSA Exceptional Civilian Service Award in 1969. and was inducted to the NSA Hall of Honor in 2009.

From left to right: Ling, Chien-Po, Yao, Shang, Mulan, Mushu, Cri-Kee, Su, Ting-Ting and Mei. The following are fictional characters from Disney's 1998 film Mulan, its 2004 sequel Mulan II, and its 2020 remake Mulan.  The Fa/Hua family  In the 2020 live-action film, the Fa family name is changed to Hua (Ëä±) in English. Hua is the Mandarin pinyin romanization of the same word as Fa, which was based on Cantonese romanization. Fa Mulan / Ping Fa Mulan is a young female who is willing to give up her life to save her father. She enters the army as a man named Ping. She faces the worst enemy China's ever seen, the Hun leader Shan-Yu, who has an army willing to destroy anything in their path. She succeeds in fighting them and saves all of China single-handedly without any help whatsoever. The Emperor of China awards her for her effort and the whole of China celebrate her return. In the 2020 live-action film, as her surname is now Hua instead of Fa, Mulan will assume the pseudonym Hua Jun during her time in the army. Fa Zhou Fa Zhou is Mulan's father who is very strict and also a famed war veteran who got injured in war. At first glance he seems like he only cares about the honor of the family and that he is quick to frustration with Mulan. He first appears putting an incense stick on the hanging dish and praying to the honorable ancestors while Mulan is seeing the matchmaker. Nothing distracts him from his prayers, even when chickens go running around in the shrine to crazily devour the chicken feed. When Chi-Fu calls him from the Fa family for military duty, he puts down the cane, stands straight and accepts his assignment scroll, not caring about his old crippled body despite his limping and visible pain. Mulan worries that he is risking his life, especially after seeing him collapse after some sword exercises. When Mulan returns in a triumph of defeating Shan Yu, she gives him Shan Yu's sword with the blade wrapped in cloth and the crest of the emperor; the two gifts that honor the Fa Family. On receiving these gifts, he immediately puts them down and confesses that all he ever wanted was Mulan to be happy and safe, informing her that his greatest honor is having her as a daughter. He was voiced by Soon-Tek Oh. In the 2020 live-action remake, he is portrayed by Tzi Ma. Fa Li Fa Li is Mulan's mother. She initially stays with the dresser waiting for Mulan to come. She is frustrated when her daughter's hair is messed with hay and sends her inside to have her bathed and cleaned up. She and all the dressers help her get dressed after the bath. After they have finished beautifying Mulan, she sends her to the impatient matchmaker who then gets enraged by Mulan's accidents. Fa Li consoles her after the matchmaker rejects her. During the rainy night, she weeps for her daughter who runs away with Khan the horse, and her husband Fa Zhou consoles her while watching over her at the same time. When Li Shang shows up in the middle of a conversation between Fa Li and Grandmother Fa about Mulan's war exploits and that she should've brought a man home, Fa Li is left stunned. According to her second film, the only other child she likes is Sha-Ron (a faux-Chinese version of the name Sharon), a little girl who wears a lavender outfit and ox-horns. She was voiced by Freda Foh Shen. In the 2020 live-action film, she is portrayed by Rosalind Chao. Grandmother Fa Grandmother Fa is Mulan's grandmother. She is very easy-going and gives Mulan the most freedom. She also provides comic relief in the family. She is first seen holding a cage with Cri-Kee in it. She covers her eyes while crossing a road and demonstrates the ability to show how lucky this cricket is. After Fa Li and all the dressers have finished beautifying Mulan, Grandma Fa gives her a few items to make her look perfect (apple, pendant, jade necklace and Cri-Kee). She constantly encourages her to find a good husband. During the rainy night, she recognizes that her granddaughter has run away to join the army in her father's place, and she picks up a lantern and prays to the ancestors, awakening First Ancestor Fa. When Mulan returns home with Shan Yu's sword and the Emperor's crest, she comments that Mulan should have brought a man home and is shocked when Li Shang arrives, causing her to jokingly say to sign her up for the next war. When Mulan asks Shang to stay for dinner, she asks him to stay forever. Mulan is shown to be fondly annoyed by this but Shang does agree to stay for dinner. In her second film, she plays a game in the house of Fa and brings in food for the perfect couple Mulan and Shang. Her speaking voice is provided by June Foray and her singing voice is provided by Marni Nixon. First Ancestor Fa First Ancestor Fa is the ghostly eldest member of the Fa family and acts as leader of the ancestors. He carries a staff with him. When he is summoned, he brings Mushu to life by saying the word \\"awaken\\". He usually stops the other ancestors from fighting and requests (what he thinks are) better plans such as summoning the Great Stone Dragon. When Mushu returns with Mulan, he gives him his job as a guardian again, though showing a frustrated face. At the beginning of his second film, he performs something interesting with the forming of smoke. He was voiced by George Takei. Other Ancestors Other Ancestors, members of the company including the farmer and his wife (a parody of the famous painting American Gothic), and the counter who is always fiddling with his abacus. Fa Deng is the only ancestor whose head is cut off, a result of Mushu's misguidance to him when he was a guardian. Many of these ancestors clamor about Mulan when she's away. Mary Kay Bergman did the voice of the female ancestors in the first film and in the second film, they are voiced by Tress MacNeille. Hua Xiu In Mulan (2020), Hua Xiu (portrayed by Xana Tang), is the sister of Hua Mulan and the second daughter of Hua Zhou and Hua Li. She is based on Mulan's younger brother from The Ballad of Mulan and Mulan's younger sister in the Ming dynasty play Mulan Joins the Army.Questions about Mulan‚Äôs Legend and History, Answered Chinese army=Li Shang Captain/General Li Shang is a Chinese army captain. His speaking voice was provided by BD Wong in both titles, and his singing vocals were performed by Donny Osmond (Jackie Chan in the Cantonese version). During his appointment in the first movie, Shang is a highly capable leader with a dedication to his cause to match, albeit at times being too \\"by-the-book\\" and putting his duty above his feelings, in contrast to Mulan. He is exceptionally handsome due to his dashing good looks and strong physique. He is reserved and thoughtful, a more logical and calming influence to Mulan's adventurous personality. Shortly after his initial introduction in Mulan, Shang is appointed newly as an army captain by his father, who is a general. Later through the film, he becomes friends with Ping (who is Fa Mulan disguised as a man), after his life is saved. Shortly after, however, he finds out she is actually a woman, which is forbidden by the empire's law and punishable by death. Shang spares her life, and after helping her save the empire, he falls in love with her and joins her family for dinner. In Mulan II, the film begins with Shang proposing marriage to Mulan, to which she gladly agrees. He is promoted from captain to general by the emperor, and he and Mulan are directed by the emperor to escort his three daughters to a conflicting kingdom in hopes that an arranged marriage between them and the three princes of the opposing nation will bring peace. He and Mulan go through many conflicts around their relationship thanks to Mushu's meddling, and midway through the film, he is assumed dead after falling into a canyon with streaming river further down. Later, when it is revealed he is alive (with help from his gray-spotted white horse), Mushu and Cri-Kee saves the day by pretending to be the Golden Dragon of Unity and freeing the princesses from their vows. Mulan and Shang get married, and later combines both families‚Äô temples so that Mushu can remain as Mulan's guardian. In Chinese naming convention, personal names in Chinese, unlike Western names, present the family/clan name first. This convention was followed in the first film; his family name was given to be Li and he was addressed as \\"Captain Li.\\" In the second film, the convention was overlooked and Shang was used as his family name by mistake. In Mulan (2020), Li Shang's leadership is remade into Commander Tung (portrayed by Donnie Yen), a mentor and teacher to Mulan who leads the Imperial Regiment; while Shang's romantic involvement with Mulan is remade into Chen Honghui (portrayed by Yoson An), a confident and ambitious recruit in Tung's unit as well as Mulan's most important ally. This schism of Shang's roles was made as the filmmakers found it uncomfortable for Mulan to have a relationship with a commanding officer, as a result of the Me Too movement following the allegations of crimes by Harvey Weinstein. Yao, Ling and Chien-Po The army recruited Yao, Ling and Chien-Po to fight the Huns. Like other newly recruited soldiers, they lacked military skills before they were trained. However, they were harder to train than most. Even Mulan learned faster than they. Eventually, their training paid off and the trio were capable fighters. Even so, they still had trouble doing things right and were rather clumsy. They served largely as the comic relief, often involving slapstick humor that made them reminiscent of the Three Stooges. Eventually, despite some early conflict, the three extended an open hand to Mulan and became her \\"army buddies\\", though they, like the rest of the army, thought she was a man named Ping. As soldiers, they each had a different color uniform: green for Mulan, red for Yao, yellow for Ling and blue for Chien-Po. Unlike most other soldiers, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po did not seem to think any less of her when they found out she was a woman, and even briefly tried to interfere when Shang was about to execute her. When they later met up, they even agreed to participate in her plan to stop the surviving Huns by disguising themselves as concubines. Somehow, they fooled the guards, though none of the three made a very attractive woman (especially Yao, as he kept his facial hair even in makeup). In the second film, the three were given a more substantial role and are shown not to have changed since the first film. Reprised by the original voice actors (sans Wilder; Watanabe did his own singing), they had been to see the matchmaker that rejected Mulan in the first film, but she decided there could not be a match for any of them and threw them out. They were discouraged but felt better when Mulan and Li Shang came to recruit them for another mission. Shang claimed to the emperor that just the five of them would be enough protection for his three daughters. Although still as bumbling as ever, Shang knew that they were instrumental in their victory against the Huns, which they did not appear to have received the same credit for. They gladly joined the escort to get the emperor's daughters to the Qui Gong princes they are engaged to. Along the way, they develop feelings for the princesses, Yao with Mei, Ling with Ting-Ting, and Chien-Po with Su. They take the princesses to a carnival for some amusement. Eventually, all three princesses admit that their feeling is mutual, and do not want to marry the princes, despite their duty. Mulan, knowing this, leaves the trio with the princesses, and goes to offer herself to the royal family instead. However, the trio arrives with the princesses, as does Shang. Mushu pretends to be the Great Golden Dragon of Unity who commands that they are allowed to marry whoever they want, allowing them to be with Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. Presumably, they did marry, though nothing was shown to indicate this. =Yao= Yao is the self-appointed leader of the trio. His signature color is red in the first film and purple in the second film. An arrogant and short-tempered individual with a bit of a Napoleon complex, he is short, stocky and has a permanent black eye. In the first film, he enjoys picking on Mulan for fun at first but eventually becomes her friend. His clumsiness reveals, however, that he is not as powerful a man as he claims to be. He states about wanting a girl who'd admire his strength and battle scars. In the second film, he reveals a rewarding plaque that has a picture of himself on his chest and falls in love with Princess Mei, the emperor's middle daughter. She accepted the idea that \\"my duty is to my heart\\" and is the easiest to be won over. In his encounter, he puts the slipper back onto her foot and sets the table for her with oranges, meat buns and tea. He wanted to marry a girl who would be impressed with his looks and his fighting ability. Although such traits leave something to be desired, he managed to impress her, and when he wins a fight at a carnival and is given a prize, he chooses a stuffed panda bear with three black legs and one white leg and gives it to her. In the 2020 live-action remake, he is portrayed by Chen Tang. His gruff characteristics are kept, but he is portrayed as being more jovial than his animated counterpart. =Ling= Ling is the group's middleman of medium height and very slim build. His signature color is yellow in the first film and blue in the second film. He is a friendly and enthusiastic man with a joke for every occasion. Though he teases Mulan at first, he, like the other two, becomes her friend. He and Yao occasionally have disagreements, but he grows to accept him as their leader. He was the one who coined the phrase \\"a girl worth fighting for.\\" In the second film, he falls in love with Princess Ting-Ting, the eldest princess. She is the most uptight princess, devoted to honor, and tries be a role model to her sisters. Ling, who wanted a girl who would laugh at his jokes (even knowing the chopstick nose trick that Ling believes to have invented), had to try harder than his partners to impress her. Unlike most people, Ting-Ting is amused by his puns, but would not laugh, claiming to dislike laughter, though the reason is that she thinks her snorting laugh is embarrassing. He begins to doubt himself. However, at the carnival, when some fireflies accidentally set off firecrackers that hit Ling, she cannot contain herself at his misfortune. She snorts, but Ling doesn't mind and thinks it's cute. At the end, they are able to get married because of Mushu. In the 2020 live-action remake, he is portrayed by Jimmy Wong. He is depicted as being much friendlier and adept at quoting poetry. =Chien-Po= Chien-Po, or Po for short, is by far the tallest and most obese of Mulan's friends with a bald head. His signature color is blue in the first film and green in the second film. He is the calmest and most spiritual of the three, and his appearance seems to have been inspired by Buddhist imagery. He is rather na√Øve compared to his partners, and loves food more than anything, which is the main thing he considers when searching for a woman for he wishes for a wife that will be good at cooking and preparing food. He is very good-natured and would never do anything to upset anyone, making him the most ready to befriend Mulan. He also possesses great strength and can lift multiple people (or a massive stone statue) with ease. In the second film, he falls in love with Princess Su, the youngest sister. The most childlike, she is easily swayed and is soon convinced of Mei's opinions. She loves food as much as Chien-Po, and when the group stops traveling for a while, she spends her time picking fruit from trees. Chien-Po discovers this, and the two of them bond easily. He even saves her when the carriage ends up falling in the water. At the carnival, they both order some dumplings, ginger, Ginsengs and soybeans. In the 2020 live-action remake, he is portrayed by Doua Moua. He is just as rowdy as his comrades in this version, but still holds his love of food. General Li General Li was Li Shang's father and a high-ranking member of the Chinese army who was killed along with his elite troops in a battle against the Hun army, leaving his helmet behind to be found by his son and his battalion when they discover the aftermath. He was voiced by James Shigeta. Cricket In Mulan (2020), Cricket (portrayed by Jun Yu) is a young hapless soldier that joins the ranks of the Chinese army and befriends Mulan, Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Chen Honghui. Cricket explains that his parents named him as such so that he can bring good fortune to himself and those around him. Despite being clumsy and shy, he is shown to be very adept at using a bow and arrow. The character is most likely a reference to Cri-Kee from the animated film.  Animals/creatures =Mushu Mushu is Fa Mulan's closest companion throughout the Mulan series. He is a scrawny, reddish-orange Chinese dragon with blue horns and a cheeky- chappy personality. He is voiced by Eddie Murphy in his first appearance and Mark Moseley (a professional Eddie Murphy impressionist) afterward. At first, Mulan's companions were to be two reptilian creatures; the idea of the creatures being dragons had not been established. However, feeling that two sidekicks would overcrowd the story, the animators then decided on a two- headed dragon, though they were green and grotesque. After the animators decided on a single-headed dragon, they established Mushu's physical concept. For better use, the animators shrunk Mushu to a smaller size.From the \\"Drawn to Animation\\" show in the Animation Building in Hollywood Pictures Backlot at Disney California Adventure Park. An animator shows Mushu's development, from a sketched idea to the finished product. Around the time when the music of the film was to be created, the songwriters had written a piece for Mushu, for him to sing to assure Mulan that he will be there to help her. However, after Eddie Murphy came to voice the character, the character and his dynamic changed. Although the animators canceled the scene, the song was a favorite among the filmmakers.According to behind-the-scenes clips on the Mulan DVD Mushu was once a guardian spirit of Mulan's family, but he has been demoted to the unappreciated position of an incense burner and gong-ringer for the deceased Fa ancestors ever since he failed to protect a family member, a soldier named Fa Deng, resulting in the soldier's demise by decapitation. In contrast to Mulan, Mushu is in most situations more zany, impulsive, and enthusiastic. He strives to be one of the family guardians again, but is content to help Mulan, even if he's the one who starts the trouble. He can also be selfish at times, but his heroism proves that he has a good heart. Mushu is very sensitive about his size, claiming to Mulan that his small stature was simply for her convenience rather than his default state. He also hates being mistaken for a lizard, insisting that he doesn't do \\"that tongue thing\\". He has the body of a snake, the horns of an elk, the claws of an eagle, and the face of a camel, resembling a legendary dragon found in Chinese art around the time. He is able to survive more like a mythical creature than an animal; he endures being stomped on, being caught in explosions, and (literally) riding out an avalanche in the first movie. He can also understand other animals, as seen when he converses with Mulan's cricket Cri-kee and horse Khan. At one point when he wants to disguise as a soldier riding a horse to get them out of the camp, he uses a giant panda as the soldier's steed after Khan, Mulan's horse, refused to help him and Cri-kee. Like many dragons, he is able to breathe fire, at first unsuccessfully, but masters it in time to stop Shan Yu's falcon, Hayabusa, from alerting the Huns to Li Shang's presence. At the start of the film, Mushu does not make his official appearance until after Mulan runs away from home to serve in her elderly father Fa Zhou's place in a war against the deadly Hun army. Knowing that Mulan's exposure will lead to the disgrace of the Fa family, the spirits of the ancestors choose to send the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve her. For the task of awakening him, they send Mushu, who would rather go himself. After several unsuccessful attempts, he eventually ends up accidentally destroying the dragon statue. In order to escape punishment from the ancestors, he pretends to be the Great Stone Dragon and secretly sets out to make Mulan a war hero. Mushu is extremely diligent and with the help of Cri-kee, helps Mulan defeat Shan-Yu, resulting in him being returned to the position of a guardian. In Mulan II, Mushu serves as an antagonist, though he redeems himself at the end. When Mulan prepares to marry Li Shang, Mushu is at first overjoyed to the point of tears, going as far as planning the wedding himself. His happiness is short-lived, however, when the ancestors gleefully inform him that once Mulan marries Shang, she will become part of his family, and Shang's family guardians will take over guardianship; Mushu would thus lose his status and be demoted back to Gong duty. Desperate to keep his pedestal, he continuously tries to break Mulan and Shang apart while Cri-kee attempts to thwart his attempts. After Cri-kee pressures him to tell the truth to Mulan, this leads her to scold him for his actions before going to reconcile with Shang. He later changes his ways, weds them (pretending to be the golden dragon), and decides that he's happy if Mulan's happy. His sacrifice causes Mulan to forgive him for trying to break her and Shang up. He even brings the peace of the kingdom by uniting Shang and Mulan. Mushu also uses his impersonation to save three princesses from being forced into an arranged marriage so they can marry whoever they want. He is then gratified when Shang combines the family temples, allowing Mushu to keep his pedestal. Mushu does not appear in the 2020 live-action remake, but at least some of his role in the narrative will be taken by a phoenix. Mushu also appears in the Drawn to Animation show at Disney California Adventure Park's Disney Animation building and Disney's Hollywood Studios's The Magic of Disney Animation. He is also a meetable character in Fantasyland at the parks alongside Mulan. Cri-Kee Cri-Kee is a \\"lucky\\" cricket that was given to Mulan while getting her ready to meet the Matchmaker. He is first seen in possession of Grandmother Fa, who crosses a road while covering her eyes to demonstrate Cri-kee's ability; however, his actions lead the Matchmaker to reject Mulan. Afterward, Mulan releases Cri-kee, but he continues to follow her and later befriends Mushu before joining him on his mission to protect Mulan. During an ambush by the Huns, he and Mushu were nearly killed when the wagon that they're in catches fire and explodes and Cri-kee follows Mulan (who has picked up Mushu while fleeing). Mushu later rescues him from an avalanche that Mulan caused to wipe out the Huns. After Mulan is expelled from the army, Cri-kee finally confesses that he isn't a lucky cricket at all. Despite this, he and Mushu help Mulan stop Shan Yu and save the Emperor, leading Mushu to deem him a lucky bug after all. In the second film, he becomes an enemy to Mushu when he tries to break up Shang and Mulan to keep his job. Cri-kee does whatever he can to foil Mushu's plans and ensure that the duo stays together, even after Mushu causes an accident that results in the destruction of a carriage that Mulan and Shang are using to transport the Emperor's daughters. Later in a canyon, Cri-kee forces Mushu to tell the truth and later becomes friends with Mushu again at the end. He is voiced by Frank Welker.  Hayabusa  Hayabusa is Shan Yu's pet saker falcon, who acts as his master's eyes and ears from a distance. At the end of the first film, his feathers are burned down by a fireball from Mushu to stop him from warning the Huns of Li Shang's presence, who then taunts him as \\"Mongolian barbeque\\" while Cri-kee laughs at him. He isn't seen afterward. In Kingdom Hearts II, Hayabusa appears in the boss battle against Shan Yu. He can grab Sora, lift him into the air, and throw him. In the 2020 live-action film, Hayabusa is replaced by Xianniang (portrayed by Gong Li), a powerful sorceress allied with Bori Khan who can transform herself into a falcon. She is the secondary antagonist of the film, and challenges Mulan's decision to fight for a society that regards her as inferior because of her gender. Xianniang ultimately betrays Khan by revealing his plans to Mulan, allowing her to warn the army, and gives her life to save Mulan by taking an arrow meant for her. Khan Khan is Mulan's horse with a black coat and white markings on his face, belly and legs. He is portrayed as a very intelligent and confident horse. When he first saw Mushu, he tried to kill him with his hooves out of fear. In the first film, during the surprise ambush on the mountains, Mulan causes an avalanche killing many Huns. Khan risks his life to save Mulan and tries his best to run to safety before he almost falls to his death off the cliff. He also seems to be very close to Mulan but doesn't like Mushu so much. In the second film, he gets angry at Mushu who tries to break Mulan and Shang up after his saddle is unbuckled and in one of his attempts, he injures him by stomping on him with his hooves as payback. Khan is voiced by Frank Welker. He appears in the 2020 live-action remake as Black Wind. Little Brother Little Brother is Mulan's pet dog. He has a blue collar around his neck. Mulan often uses him to spread chicken feeds by hanging a bone in front of him, similar to the carrot on a stick trick. He is voiced by Chris Sanders in the first movie and Frank Welker in the second movie. Shan Yu A physically imposing and ruthless Hun chieftain and the general of the Huns who serves as the main antagonist of the film. He is voiced by Miguel Ferrer in Mulan. Shan Yu is the cruel leader of the Huns who is bent on conquering China, and with his Hun army, climbs over the Great Wall and invades the land to prove his \\"superiority\\" to the Emperor. He is the only Hun to have eyes with black scleras and orange irises. His name seems to be derived from the title of Chanyu, used by many Inner Asian nomad rulers prior to the establishment of the title of khagan. Like the rest of his people, Shan Yu is trained in living off the earth, possessing heightened senses and a trained saker falcon named Hayabusa as his pet. His strength is demonstrated many times during the course of the film, such as easily breaking down a barricaded door or effortlessly slicing through a massive pillar with his sword, making him easily one of the strongest characters in the film (second perhaps only to Chien-Po). Ruthless and cold-hearted, Shan Yu kills without mercy or remorse and, on occasion, as a joke; for example, after freeing two captured Chinese scouts to carry a message to the Emperor, he then comments to an archer, \\"How many men does it take to deliver a message?\\" (The archer replies \\"one\\", nocking an arrow.) While clearly heartless to his foes, he is proud of his army, as shown at the beginning when he mocks a Chinese soldier who boasts that all of China knows he's coming (he even lights one of the signal fires with a burning banner) and when he flatly refused to avoid the Imperial troops and instead chose to take them head on, despite knowing that they were much better trained and equipped than his own men. Sometime after General Li's recruits complete their training, Hayabusa acquires a doll from a village in the Tung Shao Pass. After close examination of the doll and having some of his men inspect it for clues, Shan Yu deduces that the Imperial Army is waiting for them. Ambushing General Li's army, Shan-Yu wipes out the Emperor's best troops, including General Li, and burns the village to the ground, only the aftermath of which is seen in the film. No survivors are found by Li Shang's troops. As they head for the Imperial City, the Hun army ambushes Li Shang's troops in the Tung Shao Pass (Mushu having accidentally given away their position by firing a cannon), and use flaming arrows to destroy their ammunition wagon. Shan-Yu then leads his entire army in a mounted charge to wipe out Li Shang's small battalion. Mulan, however, takes control of Li Shang's last cannon, aiming it for a nearby mountain. This maneuver triggers an avalanche that wipes out almost all of Shan-Yu's army. The soldiers depart believing that their enemies are dead, but Shan Yu rises from the snow, along with a handful of surviving warriors and Hayabusa. Mulan, having been cast out of the army, follows them. When the Emperor is presented with Shan Yu's sword, Hayabusa snatches it and brings it up to the roof, where Shan Yu is hiding in the shadows. His men burst out of a festival dragon, grabbing the Emperor and barricading themselves inside the palace. As Shan Yu threatens the Emperor at swordpoint to bow to him, Mulan, Li Shang, Yao, Chien-Pao, and Ling infiltrate the palace, the latter three being in drag (as a disguise). Mulan, Yao, Chien-Po, and Ling defeat Shan Yu's men and Hayabusa is fried by Mushu. After securing the Emperor, Mulan finds Shan Yu about to strike Li Shang down and distracts him by revealing she was the one who wiped out his army. Pursuing her throughout the palace and onto the roof, Shan-Yu's attempt to kill Mulan backfires when Mulan initiates a plan of her own. She disarms the Hun and pins him down with his own sword while Mushu steals some fireworks and aims them at him. Mushu, Mulan, and Crik-ee then escape the roof as the Hun leader is pulled by a rocket into a tower full of other fireworks and dies in a brilliant explosion. Mulan is then awarded Shan-Yu's sword for her success at ridding China of the Huns forever. In an earlier story treatment written by Barry Cook, Shan Yu was originally intended to return in Mulan II where he and his deceased army, now ghosts, would have started to haunt Northern China, prompting the Emperor to send Mulan and Shang there to deal with the Huns. The finale would have involved Shan Yu's ghost army, led by him personally, fighting against Mulan and her allies, including the Fa Family Ancestors. In the 2020 live-action remake, an alternate version of Shan Yu is portrayed by Jason Scott Lee and is known as Bori Khan, a skilled warrior allied with a powerful witch who is intent on avenging his father's death by killing the Emperor. Instead of being Hun, Khan will be of Rouran descent. He and his men, with the witch's help, begin attacking Imperial outposts to force the Emperor to send troops after them, including a disguised Mulan. This culminates in a large battle where the Rourans surprise Mulan's small battalion with a trebuchet, which begins to decimate their positions until Mulan tricks the Rourans into setting off an avalanche which kills many of them, but still leaves enough alive for Khan to infiltrate the Imperial capital, butcher the Emperor's guards, and lure him into a trap. Just as he's prepared to burn the Emperor alive, Mulan arrives to save him. Khan tries to shoot her with an arrow, but the witch sacrifices herself by blocking his shot. He and Mulan engage in a fierce battle, during which he manages to knock her sword into a pool of burning slag. Mulan then disarms him and kicks the arrow he fired previously directly into his chest, piercing his heart and killing him.  Members of the Empire =The Emperor of China Based on the real-life emperor Qin Shi Huang, this character is shown as the wise and benevolent leader of all China. He lives in a palace (modeled, perhaps anachronistically, upon the Forbidden City) and he has a long mustache and beard. Yellow is the color that he wears in keeping with Imperial customs. In the first film, he is captured by Shan Yu and his warriors in an ambush. Mulan and Shang, in order to save him, have Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (disguised as concubines) trick Shan Yu's men into letting their guard down so they can be dealt with. After Shan Yu is terminated, the emperor comes down the steps and, though he sternly reprimands Mulan for impersonating a soldier, he then thanks her for saving their beloved country. He is the first person to bow to her, and even offers her a position on his council, but Mulan politely declines the offer by saying that she feels she should return to her family. In gratitude, he takes off his crest and puts it on her neck and gives Shan Yu's sword to her as tokens for her efforts, the crest representing what she did for him while the sword represents what she did for China. After she leaves, he puts his hat back on and tells Li Shang to go after her, noting that \\"You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty.\\" His role is a little smaller in the second film, where he instructs Mulan and Shang to take his daughters to the Mongol ruler Qui-Gong so they can be married to his sons and seal an alliance. He was voiced by Pat Morita in the first two films and the video game Kingdom Hearts II. In the 2020 live-action remake, he is portrayed by Jet Li, and is given a slightly more expanded role as he personally confronts enemy warriors when they ambush him in his palace before being subdued and prepared for execution. Upon being saved by Mulan, he offers to let her join the Imperial guard, but she declines. He later sends Commander Tung to give Mulan a new sword to replace the one she lost fighting Bori Khan as well as offer her another opportunity to join the guard. Chi-Fu Chi-Fu is a member of the Emperor's council and adviser to Li Shang who refuses to allow the recruits to join the battle against the Huns and serves as a minor antagonist of the film. He is shown to harbor substantial prejudice towards women. He is most often clad in blue and places considerable importance on his clothing. He is shown to be devoted to his job and loyal to the Emperor, but is incompetent, egotistic, pompous and misogynistic, as he silences Mulan and tells Fa Zhou to teach her silence in a man's presence, orders Li Shang to execute her once her secret is revealed, despite her saving everyone, and close to the film's conclusion pompously scoffs to Shang that Mulan would never be worth anything because she's a woman. At the end of the film, as the Emperor praises Mulan for defeating Shan-Yu and saving China, he tells Chi-Fu to arrange Mulan for membership in his council. Still believing that Mulan isn't worth anything because she is a woman, Chi-Fu attempts to dissuade him from doing so by claiming that there are no more available seats in the council, but this backfires when the Emperor tells Mulan she can have Chi-Fu's job, causing him to faint. He does not appear in Mulan II, but it is shown that someone strikingly similar to Chi-Fu is a royal adviser to Lord Qin of Qigong. He was voiced by James Hong. In the 2020 live-action remake, he's replaced by The Chancellor (portrayed by Nelson Lee). In contrast to Chi-Fu, the Chancellor has a smaller role in the film and does not interact with Mulan. He is eventually replaced by the witch Xianniang, who is able to trick the Emperor into dismissing his guards and walking into a trap by falsely claiming that Bori Khan will leave if the Emperor defeats him in single combat. Daughters of the Emperor of China The Emperor of China's three children, Ting-Ting, Mei, and Su, are princesses who first appear in Mulan II. He sends them into the carriage to complete the mission which is to marry the Princes of Qui Gong hiding their pretty faces with paper fans. When in the carriage, these princesses begin to panic as Mushu causes it to slide down by banging his head on the wheel. = Ting-Ting = Ting-Ting is the eldest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is indigo and she is taller than both of her sisters. After Mushu has caused the carriage to slide down, she forces her younger sisters out and tries to escape, but her foot is stuck only to be saved by Ling and the carriage breaks afterward. When she hears his jokes, she thinks they are funny but she tries not to laugh, as she has an embarrassing snorting laugh. However, when the firecrackers lit by the fireflies hit him, she laughs, which causes her to snort like a pig, which Ling thought was cute. Ting-Ting appears as mature and level-headed but is actually carefree in her heart. Her speaking voice is provided by Canadian award-winning actress Sandra Oh and her singing voice is provided by Judy Kuhn. She is Crown Princess of China and one day to be Her Majesty The Empress of China. = Mei = Mei is the middle daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is pink and she is in between her sisters in height. She likes to get along with Yao because she thinks he is good-looking and gentle at heart. She is convinced by Mulan that her duty is to her heart and she knows that it is true. Frustrated by her older sister, she drops her fan to get in the tent and writes, \\"And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission. I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.\\" When Yao has won a wrestling fight, he chooses the stuffed panda bear and he shares it with her. Considered a slight damsel-in- distress, she has been kidnapped by the enemies of China when the heroes have been knocked down during their fight but saved by her friends. Mei is passionate, brave and caring. Her speaking voice is provided by Lucy Liu and her singing voice is provided by Beth Blankenship. = Su = Su is the youngest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is orange and she is shorter than both of her sisters. Her favorite thing to do is gathering food from the trees and she likes to spend time with Chien-Po who likes food also. When the carriage is damaged and the fruit floats in the water, she picks them up again and she gets saved by him too. She is bright, childish and cheerful. Her speaking voice is provided by Lauren Tom and her singing voice is provided by Mandy Gonzalez.  Others =The Matchmaker This character is an impatient and harsh woman, who obnoxiously judges potential brides. After the musical number called \\"Honor To Us All,\\" she opens the doors, calls Mulan's name and takes her inside. She distastefully judges Mulan, calling her too skinny, and asks her to pour the tea as the second part of the test. Cri-Kee, who attempts to escape, ends up in the Matchmaker's cup of tea, and when Mulan tries to take the cup back, The Matchmaker falls on the floor where Cri-Kee gets into the clothing and when she gets up to tell Mulan what happened, she notices that Cri-Kee is in her clothing, causing her to crash into a stove, lighting her backside on burning embers; Mulan tries to extinguish with a paper fan, but the hot embers turn into fire, which Mulan manages to extinguish by pouring the tea on her. Blaming Mulan for the troubles, she publicly humiliates her and says that she will never bring any honor to her family being a wife. She also called Mulan a disgrace when the Matchmaker was the real disgrace. Grandmother Fa noticed her as a little stinker. The second film reveals that she's \\"smug and snooty,\\" as accused by Ling, which causes her to throw a pot onto his head as she flings out the masculine trio. She is voiced by Miriam Margolyes in the first film and April Winchell in the second film. She appears in the 2020 live-action remake and portrayed by Cheng Pei- pei. Sha-Ron Sha-Ron is a very excited little girl who appears in Mulan II. She first visits Fa Li and says that she wants to see Mulan, who's practicing kung-fu with a rake. Then as she goes outside and drops the buckets down, she and all of the other excited daughters of the villagers meet her and get trained on how to fight enemies as so during the \\"Lesson Number One\\" musical number. Then as General Shang arrives, she takes his helmet with more excitement and runs home. She is voiced by Jillian Henry. Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki Lord Qin is the priest of Qigong, first appearing in Mulan II. When Mulan is about to complete the mission, he allows her to marry his son Prince Jeeki who likes playing with the Chinese finger trap. As Lord Qin engages Mulan and his son, their wedding is interrupted and he makes Shang go away until the Golden Dragon of Unity begins to talk with Mushu's voice. He timidly allows Mulan and Shang to marry each other and then begins to play with the fingertrap Jeeki used to play with. Lord Qin is voiced by Keone Young and Prince Jeeki is voiced by Rob Paulsen.

The Inn at Carnall Hall is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The historical core of campus was built in many phases, coincident with when funding was available to build. Beginning with the construction of Old Main in 1879, buildings were built haphazardly around campus. This was changed when the architecture firm Jamieson & Spearl designed the 1925 master plan, which includes many of the Collegiate Gothic style buildings (such as the Agriculture Building).\\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form - University of Arkansas Campus Historic District.\\" National Register of Historic Places - National Park Service.

Building resumed following many Public Works Administration grants after World War II. Another interesting feature of the campus is Campus Walk. Formerly a through street, Campus Drive was converted to a footpath that runs from Maple Street on the north, through the Pi Beta Phi Memorial Gate, and follows the street's path across the campus core and through the Bell Engineering Center to the street's former intersection with Dickson Street. Listings=Old Main Old Main, the oldest and most recognizable building on campus Old Main, originally University Hall, is the University's signature building and appears on its seal.

Prior to 1872, the land was known as the McIlroy Farm. It was purchased for use as a university campus because of its prominence (the campus is still referred to as \\"The Hill\\"). In the late 1890s, part of the lawn was used as the university's first football field. Sheep were grazed on part of it. Agricultural students planted an oatfield on part of it.Leflar, Robert A. \\"The First One Hundred Years: Centennial History of the University of Arkansas,\\" 1972. The Lawn contains the earliest segments of Senior Walk, a concrete walking path that runs throughout the entire campus and contains the name of university graduates from every class since 1875. The lawn also contains the Spoofer's Stone, a piece of limestone that the builders of Old Main left in place after it fell out of an oxcart and broke.

Held in Horsemonger Lane Prison, Hunt wrote the masque to occupy himself, and it was published in 1815. The masque describes a country that is cursed by an Enchanter and begins with shepherds hearing a sound that heralds change. The Enchanter is defeated by fire coming out of clouds, and the image of Liberty and Peace, along with the Allied nations, figures representing Spring and art, and others appear to take over the land. In the final moments, a new spring comes and the prisoners are released. It is intended to represent Britain in 1814, emphasising freedom and focusing on the common people rather than the aristocracy. Many contemporary reviews from both Hunt's fellow poets and literary magazines were positive, although the British Critic described the work as a \\"pert and vulgar insolence of a Sunday demagogue, dictating on matters of taste to town apprentices and of politics to their conceited masters\\". Background During 1814, Hunt was held in Horsemonger Lane Prison, and many of his friends would come to visit him. To occupy himself when alone, he began writing a masque in order to keep busy. The play was finished during the summer, and it was later published in 1815. The work included a preface describing the \\"Origin and Nature of Masks\\". The section described how masques were started in Florence, Italy and how it was a high form of poetry. The masque tradition was stopped by Puritans during the 17th century. The work was intended to take an old form of poetry and turn it into a new form, and it was intended to challenge traditional beliefs about literature.Roe 2005 p. 215 Poem The play describes a country that is cursed by an Enchanter and begins with shepherds hearing a sound that heralds change. The Enchanter is defeated by fire coming out of clouds, and the image of Liberty and Peace, along with the Allied nations, figures representing Spring and art, and others appear to take over the land. In the final moments, a new spring comes and the prisoners are released:Roe 2005 pp. 215-216 Warmth to set the prisoners free Daisies with their pinky lashes, And the marigold's broad flashes, Hyacinth with sapphire bell Curling backward, and the swell Of the rose, full-lipp'd and warm, Round about whose riper form Her slender virgin-train are seen In their close-fit caps of green Themes The basis of the political themes is in the events of 1814 Britain. The play emphasized the freer and carnival aspects of the masque form instead of the courtly aspects. Furthermore, the masque represents freedom in terms of imagination and a more natural technique. In terms of form, The Descent of Liberty is different from standard neoclassical ideas about literature as it follows the style; there are mixes of prose along with poetry. As such, Hunt transforms the work from being traditionally aristocratic to emphasise the pastoral by focusing on the common people. The work can be seen as showing a triumph of the common people over those like Duke of Wellington and the Duke of York. Critical response Hunt's friend John Hamilton Reynolds enjoyed the work.Roe 2005 p. 221 A review in the Augustan described how Hunt had \\"risen above the pressure of sickness and imprisonment, to the height of Poetry and Philosophy.\\"Roe 2005 qtd p. 222 The Critical Review described the work as a \\"politically poetical poem ... liberally pouring forth the effusions of patriotic zeal\\". John Scott, an associate of Hunt, claimed in the Champion that the \\"poetical prisoner, seated on a wooden bench, within hearing of the clank of fetters, and with a bare and monotonous brick wall before his sight\\" was able to create a work that was \\"full of healthful English feeling\\" and was \\"prima facie evidence in favor of the kind and pure character of [Hunt's] mind\\". In a letter to Hunt from Henry Robertson and Charles Ollier, they said, \\"In our admiration of its abundant beauties we were unanimous, whether we viewed it for its fancy, for the fine human feeling that it excites, or for the grand abstractions that abound particularly towards the close of the poem. Our hearts and imaginations were alike delighted, and we found the true ends of poetry answered\\".Holden 2005 p. 87 Not all reviews were positive; The British Critic claimed that the work was a \\"pert and vulgar insolence of a Sunday demagogue, dictating on matters of taste to town apprenteices and of politics to their conceited masters\\".Roe 2005 qtd pp. 222-223 NotesReferences * Blainey, Ann.

He played a key role in consolidating Seattle's electric power and public transportation infrastructure, and was a member of Ohaveth Sholum Congregation, Seattle's first synagogue.Lee Micklin, Furth, Jacob (1840-1914), HistoryLink, October 30, 1998. Accessed online 2009-10-06. Bill Speidel called him \\"the city's leading citizen for thirty years,\\" adding that Furth \\"may even have been the most important citizen Seattle ever had.\\", p. 39. Clarence Bagley wrote shortly after Furth's death: Early life Furth was born in Schwihau, Bohemia (now ≈†vihov, Czech Republic) November 15, 1840, the son of Lazar and Anna (Popper) Furth, Jewish natives of Bohemia. Of their ten sons and two daughters, eight eventually came to America. He attended school to the age of thirteen years, then began a career as a confectioner in Budapest. He decided at sixteen (so says Bagley; other sources say 18) to try his fortune in America and made his way to San Francisco, arriving in 1856.Micklin says \\"In 1858, at the age of 16,\\" but given Furth's 1840 birth date that is self- contradictory. William Farrand Prosser, Volume 2 of A History of the Puget Sound Country, Its Resources, Its Commerce and Its People, The Lewis Publishing Company, 1903, p. 569 says he was eighteen and gives the year as 1858; he doesn't mention leaving school early and becoming a confectioner. Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 39, says simply \\"He had come to this country when he was eighteen\\" without giving a year. He had with him letters of introduction to the Schwabacher Brothers,Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 40 a prominent Jewish pioneer merchant family firm.Jean Roth, The Schwabacher Family, Jewish Genealogical Society of Washington State. Originally in The Seattle Genealogical Society Bulletin, Summer 1997. Accessed online 2009-10-07. After his arrival, he used his last ten dollars to get to Nevada City, California, where the Schwabachers had secured him a position. He clerked mornings and evenings in a clothing store, while attending public schools for about six months to improve his English. When the Schwabachers checked on him after six months, his English was already better than theirs. He was rapidly promoted, and at the end of three years he was receiving a salary of $US300 per month. He lived frugally, and invested some of his money in a quicksilver mine. By the time the Nevada City store burned in 1862, he had saved enough to open his own clothing and dry-goods store in Shingle Springs, California. Eight years later, in 1870, he moved Colusa, California, where he bought into a general mercantile store. The Schwabachers offered him financing, but he told them he had already saved enough to do this on his own. Shortly after his arrival in Colusa, he became Freemason and eventually became master of his lodge. (He would remain a Mason in Seattle.) In 1878, he was able to buy out the older partners in the store, which he owned and operated until 1882. Banking and financial positions Seattle National Bank in 1900. This building stood at the northwest corner of Second Avenue and Columbia Street in Seattle, since 1959 the site of the Bauhaus-style Norton Building. In 1882, health problems took Furth to the Puget Sound region in Washington. There, in cooperation with the SchwabachersBill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 40‚Äì41; Bagley merely says with \\"San Francisco friends\\". he helped organize the Puget Sound National Bank with a capital of fifty thousand dollars, and took charge as its cashier. Former Seattle mayor Bailey Gatzert, another Schwabacher associate, was the original bank president. The bank officially opened for business in August 1883.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 41. For several months, Furth was the bank's only employee and its only officer in Seattle. Puget Sound National Bank succeeded and prospered; at all times the earnings of the bank were sufficient to increase the capital stock as needed. In 1893 he became bank president, a role he held until his bank's consolidation with the Seattle National Bank in 1910,\\"Seattle-First National Bank Family Tree Through December 31, 1969\\", insert in Shelby Scates, Firstbank: The Story of the Seattle First National Bank (Seattle: North Pacific Bank Note Co., 1970).Micklin writes \\"In 1893, Puget Sound National consolidated with Seattle National Bank (renamed Seattle First National-Dexter Horton Bank).\\" This contradicts the chart in the Scates book, which shows that merger as occurring in 1910, and dates the name Seattle First National-Dexter Horton Bank from the large 1929 merger that brought together the companies that would be known from 1935 as Seattle-First National Bank (known after 1974 as Seafirst Bank, eventually merged into the present- day Bank of America). after which he became chairman of the board of directors of the latter.

Roe Anderson In eulogizing Furth, Judge Thomas Burke said of him, Some seventy years later, Bill Speidel was more succinct: \\"All Jacob Furth did was take a squalid little village named Seattle and turn it into a world class city. He made good on Doc Maynard's dream.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Seattle, Furth (along with Gatzert and Seattle Post-Intelligencer founder John Leary) rescued the Spring Hill Water system from bankruptcy. The privately owned firm supplied the city's water. A new pumping station on Lake Washington in what is now the Mount Baker neighborhood made the system viable, doubling its previous capacity. Although the deal was initially viewed largely as a matter of public service, Furth's financial acumen resulted in a profit. After the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889, which the Spring Hill system failed to put out, Furth broke with most of the city's business interests to back city engineer R. H. Thomson's proposal for a municipally owned gravity-flow system. J.J. McGilvra was the only other member of the Seattle establishment to take this side in the fight.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 42. Furth assembled $150 million in bank loans after the Great Seattle Fire, and promised that his bank would make no effort to profit from the fire. In the Panic of 1893, he dissuaded the directors of his Seattle National Bank from calling in all loans. \\"What you propose,\\" he said, \\"may be good banking, but it is not human.\\" A rapid trip to New York City secured enough capital to buy control of the bank and weather the crisis. Financing of shipping and railroads Shortly after the Great Seattle Fire, Furth financed seaman Joshua Green in acquiring his first vessel, the Fannie Lake (or Fanny Lake); Green would eventually consolidate the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet and center it at Seattle, a major factor in Seattle's rise to regional preeminence,Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 33‚Äì39. and later became a banker himself.The Green Family in Seattle , Joshua Green Coroporation. Accessed online 2009-10-07. Furth arranged financing for Green's first shipping firm, the La Conner Trading and Transportation Company, as well as another successful steamboat line, the Anderson Steamboat Company. Furth worked with both the E.H. Harriman and James J. Hill interests to bring their respective railroads to Seattle, finally bringing Seattle the transcontinental rail connection it had sought for decades.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, especially p. 71 et. seq. Stone & Webster Furth's work with Stone & Webster‚Äîto consolidate the city's public transportation system and to consolidate and develop electrical power sources to power them‚Äîwas more controversial. In the 1890s, Seattle had fourteen independent streetcar and cable car lines; all but J.J. McGilvra's line on Madison Street eventually failed financially, most of them in the wake of the Panic of 1893.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 81‚Äì83. Most of them survived only by funding operations out of what should have been maintenance capital.Richard C. Berner, Seattle 1900-1920: From Boomtown, Urban Turbulence, to Restoration, Seattle: Charles Press, 1991, , p. 42. Working with Stone & Webster, Furth stitched together a single system, the Seattle Electric Company and‚Äîunder pressure from the Seattle City Council, in order to gain the franchise‚Äîestablished a flat fare, initially 5 cents including transfers (previously, a single trip could have cost as much as 40 cents). In 1902, this was expanded with Interurbans to Tacoma and Renton. However, in contrast to the post-Fire investment that had so clearly been for the common good of the city, Seattle Electric was a for-profit, private undertaking, owned largely by East Coast interests. This put Furth in direct conflict with the advocates of local public ownership. Furthermore, the consolidation of the streetcar lines did not solve the maintenance issues, with \\"overcrowding, erratic service, accidents, [and] open cars even in winter\\" remaining common.Richard C.

Accessed online 2009-10-07. The 1902 election saw strong populist support for public power, leading to the establishment of Seattle City Light and the city's involvement in hydroelectricity. For the next half- century, Seattle would be variously served by municipal electricity and by Seattle Electric and its successors, until the city bought out its private competitor in 1951. Lou Graham connection According to Bill Speidel, brothel-owner Lou Graham was effectively Furth's silent partner from her 1888 arrival in Seattle until her death in 1903. He provided the banking, real estate, and political connections she required to establish the city's leading parlor house; when people came to him seeking a loan, and he thought their idea was good but that he'd never get it past his board of directors, he referred them to Graham for an informal, high-interest loan. She may have been instrumental in saving Puget Sound National Bank from a bank run during the Panic of 1893, by ostentatiously making a large deposit. When she died, a Puget Sound National Bank employee became administrator of her estate.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 49‚Äì52, 62‚Äì64, 59. The Schricker scandal Toward the end of his life, Furth's reputation was somewhat tarnished by a scandal related to a bank in La Conner, Washington, although Furth was posthumously acquitted of all culpability.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 86‚Äì87 W.E. Schricker's private bank in La Conner failed in 1912 with $378,766.91 in debts and less than $200,000 in assets. Schricker blamed Furth and other officers of Furth's bank; Furth was arrested, lampooned in the press, and convicted by a jury on April 18, 1913, and fined $10,000. Schricker accused Furth of recommending that he continue to take deposits even after he knew his bank was in trouble. The prosecutor amplified this with a charge that Furth had done so to keep Schricker's bank going just long enough to pay notes due to Furth's bank, thereby harming other depositors. However, Furth was unaware that Schricker had made $348,554.83 in self-dealing loans to the Fidalgo Lumber Company of Anacortes, Washington, of which Schricker was a partner. In other words, most of the bank's debts could be accounted for by Schricker's failure to collect from himself. The conviction was completely overturned on appeal, December 18, 1914, but by that time Furth was not alive to see his reputation cleared. Civic associations and public office Furth, lower left, as a member of the Board of Directors of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Among other associations, Furth was a member of Seattle's prestigious Rainier Club and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce. He was a two- term president of the Chamber. He served as a Republican on the Seattle City Council from 1885 until 1891. In 1901 he was the key organizer of Seattle's anti-union Citizens' Alliance.Richard C. Berner, Seattle 1900-1920: From Boomtown, Urban Turbulence, to Restoration, Seattle: Charles Press, 1991, , p. 111. He also played a key role in fundraising for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, p. 85‚Äì86. Marriage and family In California, in 1865, Furth married Lucy (or Lucia) A. Dunton, a native of Indiana from what Lee Micklin characterizes as \\"an early American family\\"; they eventually had three daughters: Jane E., Anna F., and Sidonia.Micklin, Bagley, Prosser. Micklin and Prosser give the date of Furth's marriage; Prosser and Bagley give the middle initials of the daughters. Bagley spells (presumably misspells) Furth's wife's maiden name Dunten; Micklin variously calls her \\"Lucy\\" or \\"Lucia\\", the other sources consistently say \\"Lucy\\". In 1884, Lucy Furth, along with Babette Gatzert (wife of Bailey Gatzert, and herself born a member of the Schwabacher familyLee Micklin, Schwabacher Bros. & Company opens Seattle branch in Autumn 1869, HistoryLink, January 01, 1998.

The town was established at the junction of the newly built Marysville-Newton Road and the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. By the early 1880s, the Ohio Central Railroad had built a northwest-southeast line that crossed the southwest-northeast A&GW; line.Liberty Township Plat (Tax) Map 1890, archives of the Union County Auditor's Office The Peoria railroad station, situated at the grade crossing of the two lines, was the only depot in Liberty Township that could accommodate both freight and passengers. The station also featured water and a coaling tower. Remnants of the foundations of these structures are still visible today. Largely because of the railroad station and the post office established there in 1872, Peoria quickly became a commercial center, featuring stores, churches, warehouses, small businesses‚Äîincluding a barber shop and a mill‚Äîand a public school. The population of the village was estimated at 150 in 1910.  Peoria today  The commercial enterprises of the past in Peoria no longer exist. The school and the churches are also gone. With the closing of the post office in 1967, the town became primarily residential, with commerce flowing to nearby Raymond and Marysville.

A4. He was released and deported in October 1978, having served 10 months of his sentence. The case later resurfaced at a 1989 American extradition hearing, at which Esmail, Dershowitz, and Freedman all testified, and was mentioned in books by Dershowitz and his critic Norman Finkelstein.Dershowitz, Alan.

University of California Press, 2008 (2nd ed.). p. 149. The trial Esmail was tried before a three-judge panel headed by Dov Levin. His conviction was based on his statements in the disputed confession and in court. Esmail had stated that he had been recruited at MSU, had donated money to the PFLP and assisted in distributing its literature, and had traveled to Libya in 1976 for ideological instruction and military training. Langer had challenged Esmail's confession in court, alleging that he had been kicked, beaten, and deprived of sleep until he had agreed to sign it. However, the court accepted the confession as valid. The court acknowledged that Esmail had come to Israel to visit his father, not on behalf of the PFLP. Esmail was acquitted on the more serious charge of \\"contact with a foreign agent\\" on the grounds that the PFLP did not represent a foreign government. American reaction American supporters charged that Esmail had been held without access to a lawyer, interrogated harshly, and threatened with being prevented from seeing his dying father unless he signed a confession, rendering his confession invalid. They also argued that Israel was overstepping its authority by trying an American citizen over actions that were legal in the places where they allegedly occurred; the New York Times described this as \\"the issue of overriding interest\\" in the case.. The authors were the co-chairs of the National Committee to Defend the Human Rights of Sami Esmail. In March 1978 pro-Esmail protests were held in New York, Boston, Washington, Detroit, East Lansing, and San Francisco. The city council of Detroit (which had a large Arab-American population) passed a resolution in support of Esmail.

He lectured at Harvard Law School annually for 30 years, and was a visiting professor at Georgetown Law School from 2007 to 2012.

Barron, A Short History of the George Washington University Law School. 78-79 He taught Contracts every year, beginning in the 1960-l961 academic year, and Appellate Practice & Procedure, beginning in the 1962-1963 academic year, along with other occasional courses including Current Decisions (for Law Review members), Equity, Agency, and Federal Jurisdiction.information from Bulletins in the Library, provided by Strategic Communications and Marketing office at the George Washington Law School During the 1960s, he encouraged many women to attend law school, based on the idea that the law school would benefit from having more women in the student body.Barron, 69-70 One effectual way Professor Freedman taught ethics was to point out and discuss ethical issues that arose in cases already under discussion from the contracts textbook. Freedman is noted for criticism of restrictions on lawyer advertising, restrictions on trial publicity by defendants and defense attorneys. He has argued that lawyers should be permitted to reveal information necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm, that law professors' sexual relations with students should be recognized as unethical conduct, and that the lawyer's decision to represent a client is a moral decision. During the 1960s, Freedman served as chair of the National Capital Area American Civil Liberties Union, was counsel to several civil rights organizations, and was a consultant to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. He was volunteer general counsel of the Mattachine Society. He was the first executive director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. Freedman has received many awards and honors, including the American Bar Association's Michael Franck Award for Professional Responsibility in 1998.\\"Past Michael Franck Award Recipients\\", American Bar Association (accessed 2013-3-19). Education Freedman was born in Mount Vernon, New York, the son of Dorothea (Kornblum) and Chauncey Freedman. He attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School, receiving an A.B. cum laude in 1951, an LL.B. in 1954, and an LL.M. from Harvard Law School in 1956. Writings Freedman's first ethics book, Lawyers' Ethics in an Adversary System, was published in 1975 and received the ABA's Gavel Award Certificate of Merit. It received a number of favorable reviews; in the Harvard Civil Rights/Civil Liberties Law Review, NYU professor Norman Dorsen called the book one of the few \\"monumental contributions to legal education in the past generation.\\" Understanding Lawyers' Ethics, first published in 1990, is required or recommended reading in many law schools. The ABA journal The Professional Lawyer called the book \\"thoughtful and eloquent\\" and \\"idealistic in the best sense of the word, pragmatic, but not cynical, and rich with practical examples.\\" Among his many articles on lawyers' ethics is \\"The Professional Responsibility of the Criminal Defense Lawyer: The Three Hardest Questions\\" (1966),Monroe Freedman, \\"The Professional Responsibility of the Criminal Defense Lawyer: The Three Hardest Questions\\", Michigan Law Review, vol. 64, p. 1469 (1966). about which William H. Simon wrote: \\"Suppose you had to pick the two most influential events in the recent emergence of ethics as a subject of serious reflection by the bar. Most likely, you would name the Watergate affair of 1974 and the appearance [in 1966] of an article by Monroe Freedman.\\"William Simon, \\"'Thinking Like a Lawyer' About Ethical Questions\\", 27 Hofstra L. Rev 1 (1998). That article provoked controversy because of Freedman's emphasis on the criminal defense lawyer's central duty to serve as an advocate for the client, even when the lawyer believes the client may intend to lie on the witness stand. Warren E. Burger, then chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and later Chief Justice of the United States, was so unhappy with Freedman's position that he unsuccessfully initiated disbarment proceedings.Matt Schudel, \\"Monroe H.

As small mounds, they were assessed as being potentially significant for revealing the origins and demise of the Hopewell in the midwestern United States. For this reason, the mounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1974, along with the Dunns Pond Mound; they are the only historic district in Logan County. In nominating the mounds for listing, the Ohio Historical Society noted the mounds' location within Indian Lake State Park as being significant for archeological education: it was hoped that visitors to the park would become aware of the significance of the mounds and consequently seek to preserve archeological sites on their own properties.

The e-mail consists of a promotion of and installation instruction for an imaginary antivirus product purported to remove unknown infections from the computer. While infection cannot occur until the attached worm is renamed and opened, it could spread to system folders in a matter of seconds. It is known to shut down or hang Windows Vista and Windows 7 when attempts to write on the system drive are denied by said operating systems. Also, the worm hides folders and makes them \\"super hidden\\" so that data contained in them are not easily accessed. Precision key logging is the main threat associated with Daprosy infection. Logged keystrokes containing sensitive data could be sent to its author using the worm‚Äôs improvised mailing system. Early strains are known to destabilize, corrupt and even stall the operating system due to programming bugs. Said strains appear to be incomplete and were probably created by students or amateur Visual Basic programmers as evidenced by using VB decompilers. Final or later releases of Daprosy worm are prolific online game password stealers. They also pose great threats to banking and other e-commerce establishments. Daprosy worm is rampant in public Internet caf√©s with LAN connections and exposed USB mass storage drives. As of October 2009 special scripts are available to remove it from infected computers. Many Windows system were stalled last November 13, 2009. An initial investigation points to the older versions of Daprosy Worm, viz. Sophos Autorun-AMS and Autorun-AMW, which appear to be \\"Friday the Thirteenth\\" malware. More recent and persistent variants of Daprosy worm are still in circulation. A notable variant, Win32/Kashu.B as identified by Ahnlab, can be removed only by using live CD. Usually, such variants of Daprosy worm are infected by Sality viruses and usually have file size greater than 100 kilobytes. It now appears that Daprosy worm is a natural host to file-infecting viruses since the former is well distributed on all drives. Viral Daprosy exists in many variants which again requires special scripts to remove. Manual removal of worms infected with viruses requires knowledge usually belonging to individuals associated with AV companies. Daprosy is \\"active\\" even in Safe Mode which makes it difficult to manually remove. Its key logging mechanism is so precise that it captures almost everything typed on the keyboard. This ranks Daprosy as one of the most dangerous worms of the last decade.

It was published under the organization's The Fellowship Press, Inc., located at 108 Lexington Avenue in New York City. Prior to June 1918, the periodical was titled The New World. It was a leading voice of Christian socialism in the United States, with an \\"independent, militant\\" editorial line. Editorial and staff history Through the years, The World Tomorrow's editorial masthead was a melange of rotating names and titles, with differences between full-, part-time, paid, and unpaid editors and staff never made particularly clear. However, titles aside, the editorial constant at the magazine from 1922 to its closing was pacifist Devere Allen, generally listed as \\"managing editor.\\" Over the years, writers and editors for the magazine included a number of prominent figures in politics, religion, journalism, and the arts. From 1918 to 1921, Norman Thomas, six-time presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America, served as the magazine's first editor. In 1921, Thomas moved to secular journalism as associate editor of The Nation magazine. Walter Fuller, originally styled \\"editorial secretary\\" in the early The New World in 1918, was later given the title \\"associate editor.\\" He did the actual work of editing for Norman Thomas, and was paid a regular salary. In February 1920, he moved on to become managing editor of The Freeman, although his name remained for a while on the list of members of the board of The World Tomorrow. When Fuller collapsed and died of a brain hemorrhage in September 1927, Norman Thomas sent a glowing eulogy to the BBC, for whom Fuller was editing Radio Times. Devere Allen, who edited the magazine for more than ten years, from 1922 to 1934, was a Socialist pacifist activist.Bernard K. Johnpoll, \\"Devere Allen (1891-1955),\\" in Johnpoll and Harvey Klehr (eds.), Biographical Dictionary of the American Left. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986; pp. 2-3. He championed nonviolent resistance while member of the Socialist Party of America in the 1930s and founded the World-Over Press after leaving The World Tomorrow. In 1926, African-American novelist, Wallace Thurman, became an editor at The World Tomorrow after serving as managing editor at The Messenger, a political literary magazine, where he published fellow Harlem Renaissance writers like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. John Nevin Sayre was listed as editor of The World Tomorrow from 1922 to 1924, and then as associate secretary from 1924 to 1935. Sayre was an Episcopal minister, peace activist, and author who helped found the Episcopal Peace Fellowship. Sayre's brother, Assistant Undersecretary of State Francis B. Sayre, had Alger Hiss reporting directly to him at the State Department but declined to testify on his behalf. His brother married the daughter of Woodrow Wilson. Militant English peace activist and suffragist Evelyn Sharp wrote for the magazine in the early 1920s and was listed as its correspondent in England. Anna Rochester was a FOR member who served as editor-in-chief from 1922 to 1926, then resigned in 1927 over political differences. Within a month, she received an invitation to join the magazine's board, which she declined. Kirby Page, listed as editor from 1926 to 1934, was an American Disciples of Christ minister, an author, and a peace activist. Prominent American theologian and commentator on public affairs Reinhold Niebuhr contributed to the magazine in the 1920s and then became a part-time editor. Niebuhr became an anti-communist in 1940, after starting as a leftist minister in the 1920s (indebted to theological liberalism) and a new neo-orthodox theologian in the 1930s. Grace Hutchins, the life partner of Anna Rochester, was also a FOR member who worked for the magazine. Hutchins served as press secretary (1924‚Äì1926), business editor (1925‚Äì1926), and contributing editor. Esther Shemitz, later the wife of Whittaker Chambers, and Shemitz's close friend Grace Lumpkin worked for the magazine in the 1920s. Hutchins and Rochester were their art patrons, supporting Shemitz's painting and Lumpkin's writing, e.g., publication of To Make My Bread (1933). A. A. MacLeod, later a Communist member of the Ontario legislature, served as managing editor until 1933. In the 1930s, Paul Douglas, an economist at the University of Chicago and later a United States Senator from Illinois, served for a time as editor. Henry Noel Brailsford contributed a weekly feature in the 1930s. Resurgence and demise In August 1932, when many weekly magazines were reducing their publication frequency to monthly, Time reported that The World Tomorrow would go from a monthly to a weekly format. \\"The times in which we are now living demand a sustained emphasis upon religion, pacifism, and socialism, and... no other American journal is concentrating upon this combination.\\" It noted that its editors included Page, Niebuhr, Allen, and Douglas. However, the magazine did not long survive the departure of Devere Allen in 1934. The World Tomorrow was subsumed by the Fellowship of Reconciliation's quarterly journal Fellowship, a publication which continues to this day. The Fellowship of Reconciliation's website simply states: > By 1934, its circulation had risen to 40,000. The World Tomorrow was > succeeded in 1935 by Fellowship, edited by Harold Fey; later editors > included John Nevin Sayre, Alfred Hassler, William Miller, James Forest, and > Virginia Baron. Publishing history According to holdings at the Library of Congress, the magazine was published as follows: * Monthly: January 1918 ‚Äì July 1932 (suspended May‚ÄìSeptember 1926) * Weekly: September 1932 ‚Äì April 1933 * Monthly: May‚ÄìAugust 1933 * Biweekly: August 31, 1933 ‚Äì July 26, 1934 For the first five issues of the first volume (January‚ÄìMay 1918) its title was The New World.

The facility is operated by the State of Illinois in Chester, Illinois and is a part of the Illinois Department of Human Services, formerly the Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities. It is adjacent to the Menard Correctional Center. The other secure mental health center in Illinois is Elgin Mental Health Center, which houses women as well as men. Chester Mental Health Center is a men's facility. History The Board of Charities recommended a separate institution for the criminally insane as early as 1878. In 1879, the legislature authorized such a facility, but the appropriation was not used for this. In 1883, the governor again tried to fund a new institution, but there was disagreement over the site with both Springfield and Joliet as possibilities. In 1889, the legislature established the Asylum for Insane Criminals, and it received its first patients on November 2, 1891. W.T. Patterson transferred from the staff of Elgin State Hospital to become its first Superintendent. Control of the institution was placed with the Commissioners of the Southern Penitentiary at Menard. The original building on the penitentiary grounds was poorly constructed and was eventually torn down. A replacement was built on a separate campus near Chester, Illinois. When the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities was abolished in 1909, the institute was reorganized and renamed Chester State Hospital effective January 1, 1910. In 1917, the Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for Chester State Hospital and retained control until the creation of the Department of Mental Health in 1961 (L. 1961, p. 2666). In 1975, the hospital changed its name to the Chester Mental Health Center. The Center was the second secure psychiatric facility in the United States to be accredited by the then Joint Commission of Hospitals, now the Joint Commission of Healthcare Operations (JACHO). It was the first such facility to be accredited in Illinois. This was accomplished while Terry B. Brelje, Ph.D. was the superintendent. Today The hospital is primarily used to care for forensic patients who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, those persons found unfit to stand trial, and those who cannot be housed in a less secure setting. The patients (not convicts, as they have not been sentenced to a correctional facility) are required by Illinois law to remain confined in a mental hospital for a period of time. Attempted Closing In late 2011 Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn attempted to close down this facility, citing cost as the reason. However, it was decided that Chester Mental Health must remain open because there is no other maximum security mental facility to house people found unfit to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity in the state of Illinois.

Tianzifang or Tianzi Fang (; Shanghainese: Deedz…ø F√£Àê) is a touristic arts and crafts enclave that has developed from a renovated traditional residential area in the French Concession area of Shanghai. It is now home to boutique shops, bars and restaurants. Overview The district comprises a neighborhood of labyrinthine alleyways off Taikang Road (), a short street which is today mostly known only for Tianzi Fang. Tianzi Fang is known for small craft stores, coffee shops, trendy art studios and narrow alleys. It has become a popular tourist destination in Shanghai, and an example of preservation of local Shikumen architecture. It is sometimes compared to Xintiandi, though in the latter precinct most of the houses were demolished and rebuilt, rather than renovated. Tianzi Fang is largely hidden from the neighbouring streets, as it grew from the inside of the block outward, although there are now shops on Taikang Road itself. Historically Lane #248 was a key entrance that, in order to gain access to the commercially developed area, required walking about 50m through whilst be surrounded by local residents' life, including bicycles, hanging laundry, etc. until finally emerging in the 'new' area. History The neighborhood centres on a block of Shikumen residential development dating from 1933. The shikumen complex was named \\"Zhicheng Fang\\", where \\"Zhicheng\\" meant \\"realisation of ambition\\" while \\"Fang\\" meant \\"neighbourhood\\" and was a common suffix for shikumen estates. Today's Tianzi Fang precinct covers not only the former Zhicheng Fang, but also other adjoining houses, apartments and industrial buildings of various styles. Located near the eastern end of the Zhaojiabang canal and the southern edge of the Shanghai French Concession, it was in the relatively downmarket part of the Concession. In 1954, the canal was filled in and the former canal basin became a busy transport interchange. Zhicheng Fang remained an ordinary residential neighbourhood until the last quarter of the 20th century, when the cheap rent but convenient location attracted artists to set up studios there. In 1998, the formerly busy wet market on Taikang Road was moved indoors. In 2001, the precinct was redesignated an artistic and creative quarter, drawing on its former popularity with artists. At the same time, the whole precinct was given the name \\"Tianzi Fang\\", a pun on Tian Zifang, a figure from the Warring States period and often referred to as China's earliest recorded artist. In 2006 it was slated for demolition to make way for redevelopment. Opposition among local business owners and residents, as well as a famous artist Chen Yifei who had a studio in Tianzifang, in addition to a group submitted a proposal to the local government to preserve the Taikang Road area and its traditional architecture and ambience. Rezoning of Tianzi Fang into a tourist precinct began in 2005/2006 with nearby art schools and studios, and later small international business owners found out about Tianzi Fang through the local grapevine. Its development began very slowly with local merchants, a New Zealand store, Japanese restaurants, and a tea house setting up in the district. From the beginning of 2007, journalists, visitors and local residents began to visit the area and spread the word about a cosy little lane district that housed some interesting and creative businesses. Additional articles in both local and foreign media such as the New York Times helped increase awareness of this older and unusual community, that stood out among the more modern and commercial shopping areas of Shanghai. Today Tianzi fang is located in one of the most expensive areas in Shanghai. It has become a major tourist attraction and has more than 200 diverse small businesses such as cafes, bars, restaurants, art galleries, craft stores, design houses and studios, and even French bistros. It is adjacent to the SML center which is among the largest shopping malls in Shanghai upon completion. It is also near the Shanghai Metro Line 9's Dapuqiao Station which is immediately to the south. Despite all the businesses selling trendy craft and some foreign goods, the area does not have the look of having been overly beautified - electricity cables are still strung overhead, and air conditioning units are obvious on the outside of the buildings. The district is distinctly different from Xintiandi, another Shikumen redevelopment in central Shanghai further to the northeast, in that it has managed to preserve its residential feel, adding to its appeal.

He then transferred to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana where he completed his college football eligibility. Professional career=New York Jets Turk was drafted as a linebacker by the New York Jets as the number 58 pick overall, the sixth selection in the third round, in the 1974 NFL Draft. He had surgery on August 14, 1974 to repair ligament damage to his left shoulder suffered during the 1974 pre- season. The extensive recovery period from the surgery prevented him from playing any regular season games during his rookie year (1974) with the Jets. Turk participated in all 14 games in the 1975 season for the Jets, recording two interceptions. He wore #56 while he was with the Jets and was listed as being 6'3\\" tall and weighing 230 lbs. Prior to the 1976 NFL season, Turk was traded to the Denver Broncos for pick 129, 17th pick in the 5th round, of the 1977 NFL Draft. The player the Jets selected in 1977 with the 129th pick was Gary Gregory, an offensive tackle from Baylor University. Denver Broncos Turk played for the Denver Broncos from 1976 through 1978.

Headed by a high ranking member of the State Police, they are present in every \\"Questura\\", the provincial office of the Public Safety Department, which is the ministerial branch Italian State Police belongs to. The same service is also performed by personnel of Police Precincts, whose first- response vehicles work alongside and under the same provincial dispatch office that resides in the Questura, making them all identical. All patrol vehicles used by this Division are specifically equipped for this kind of response, including reinforcing plates in the bodywork, especially in the doors, bulletproof and shatterproof windows and the iconic prisoner transport partition behind the first row of seats. Police precincts also have non- bulletproof emergency vehicles that do not log in with the first-response division, but are equally capable of responding to an event, which are called \\"Autoradio\\" (radio car or, like in other states radio motor patrol (RMP)) instead. The mobile units are the public face of the State Police because their crews are in direct contact with citizens. They follow up on all calls coming to the police emergency number, which is 113 in Italy, even though since few years some provinces transitioned to the european unique emergency number 112. They, therefore, are called on to address all types of incidents, from simple noise complaints, domestic incidents, as well as serious crimes such as fights, muggings, robberies or murders. Polizia di Stato reparto volante in Rome Mobile units often patrol beats, with the number of simultaneous patrols depending on the size of the Questura. In medium and large cities, each patrol is assigned a beat, or a specific and precise area route to be covered. Beats usually coincide with areas of jurisdiction of police precincts in the area, and there may be more than one volante (nickname for emergency response patrol cars, literally translated: \\"flying\\") per precinct area. Each Mobile Division of a Questura is headed by an inspector coordinator per shift who is responsible for all units on duty. This inspector provides the specific direction for all the squads under his or her command. Currently Rome is the only city in which a 2nd Mobile Division has been inaugurated as of December 3rd, 2019. The patrols, in addition to their role of responding to crimes in progress also work in the area of crime prevention. The officers of the Mobile Division know their beat and the people who usually frequent it, carefully observe their surroundings, and work to prevent crime.

Following the American Civil War, he became active in Galveston politics, serving as an alderman and a national Republican delegate. He was appointed as United States Collector of Customs in 1889 in Galveston. Cuney had the highest-ranking appointed position of any African American in the late 19th-century South.Hales (2003), p.16 He was a member of the Union League and helped attract black voters to the Republican Party; in the 1890s, more than 100,000 blacks were voting in Texas. Establishing his own business of stevedores, he helped to unionize black workers in Galveston, opening jobs for them on the docks. He substantially improved employment and educational opportunities for blacks in the city. He eventually rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party and became a national committeeman. Cuney is regarded by many as the most important black leader in Texas in the 19th century and one of the most important in the United States. Of mixed race and majority-white ancestry, he was born into slavery. He was freed by his white planter father and sent north to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for his education. The war interrupted his plans to attend Oberlin College, but he continued to learn all his life. Cuney became active in black fraternal organizations, and was elected by black Masons as the grand master of the Grand Lodge of Texas in 1875. Early life and education Norris Wright Cuney was born on May 12, 1846, near Hempstead, Texas, in the Brazos River valley.Hare (1913), p. 3 He was the fourth of eight children of Adeline Stuart, a mixed-race slave of African, European, and Native American ancestry. Among his mixed-race siblings, all of whom were majority white, were his older brother Joseph, who later became an attorney, and his younger brother Nelson, who became a building and painting contractor. Their father was Adeline's white master, Colonel Philip Cuney, a wealthy planter of English ancestry. He had a white \\"first\\" family and eventually married a total of three white wives after the earliest ones died in childbirth or from disease. All his mixed-race children were born into slavery. Philip Cuney was a politician and was elected as state senator.Cartwright (1998), p. 131 By 1850 Philip Cuney was one of the largest landowners in the state, with 2,000 acres and 105 slaves, including Stuart and her children. In 1860 he was one of the 50 largest slaveowners in the state.Hales (2003), pp. 6 Cuney raised cotton but also had a dairy operation, with several hundred cows, plus beef cattle brought to the marriage by his second wife, Adeline Ware, with whom he had three children before her death before 1850.Hales (2003), pp. x, 6 He married for the third time in 1851. Cuney considered Houston his home, where he settled in 1853.Hare (1913), p. 8 By the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, adopted from the model of Virginia colonial slave law, the mixed-race, majority-white Stuart children were all born into slavery, as their mother was a slave. Their father freed his mixed-race children and their mother sometime before the Civil War, starting with the oldest son Joseph in 1853. He sent his sons to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the Wylie Street School for people of color for education.Hales (2003), p. 12 When Norris was freed in 1859, he took his father's surname of Cuney. His father sent him to Pittsburgh for schooling at that time. Jennie Cuney was freed and sent to Europe for her education; she later passed into white society, consistent with her majority-white ancestry. The Civil War interrupted Norris' plans to attend Oberlin College in Ohio, which was open to students of all races and both genders.Gatewood (2000), p. 20 After the outset of the war, Norris Cuney gained work on a steamship that traveled on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers between Cincinnati and New Orleans. Spending a great deal of time in New Orleans, he became friends with influential figures such as P. B. S. Pinchback, a mixed-race man educated in the North who returned to the South after the war. He was elected as a Republican lieutenant governor of Louisiana and succeeded to the position of the state's first black (or, more accurately, person of color) governor. At the end of the war, Cuney moved back to Texas and settled in Galveston. He entered postwar society as a literate, educated, mixed-race son of a wealthy and powerful white politician father, which gave him social advantages. His mother and brothers joined him in Galveston, where they lived within a few blocks of each other.Hare (1913), p. 8Hales (2003), pp. xi, 17 Cuney began self-study in law and literature. After the war, Cuney met George T. Ruby, a representative of the Freedmen's Bureau, the federal agency responsible for providing aid to former slaves and helping them negotiate a free labor society. Its headquarters in Texas were in Galveston. Ruby was secretly a director of the Union League, an organization dedicated to attracting freedmen to the Republican Party. (It was a relatively small organization in Texas at the time, as the Democratic Party had dominated southern white politics and Texas was a white-majority state). Cuney became increasingly involved with the Union League and Ruby's ideology. In 1870 there were 3,000 blacks in Galveston,Hales (2003), pp. 15‚Äì16 nearly one-quarter of its 13,818 total population recorded in the US Census that year. Career Cuney's career rose with Galveston's growth as a port and progressive city. In 1870 he was appointed first sergeant-at-arms of the Texas Legislature. He befriended the Republican governor Edmund J. Davis. He was appointed as a state delegate to the 1872 national Republican convention and served in this role for the next two decades, attending every convention until 1892. In 1871 Cuney's interest in educational opportunities for blacks led to his appointment as one of the school directors for Galveston County.Hare (1913), p. 14 The biracial Reconstruction-era legislature established a public school system in Texas for the first time, and the state was setting it up. Cuney worked to ensure that tax allocations guaranteed education for black students in the segregated system. Cuney was appointed head of the Galveston chapter of the Union League in 1871. As George T. Ruby left Texas politics, Cuney gained much of his clout without some of his negative associations. Ruby had been strongly connected to unpopular Reconstruction programs.Hales (2003), p. 58 In 1873 Cuney was appointed secretary of the Republican State Executive Committee. That same year he presided over the Texas convention of black leaders in Brenham. In 1872 Cuney was appointed as the federal inspector of customs for the Port of Galveston and revenue inspector at Sabine Pass. Cuney became a popular figure in the community. As reform efforts in the city were pushed forward by the community's business leaders, including the Galveston Cotton Exchange garnering support for harbor improvements, Cuney was asked to participate.Hales (2003), p. 48 This was a period of dramatic growth in the South and nationally of black fraternal organizations, part of the political organizing by freedmen. While not active in any church, Cuney joined a Prince Hall Lodge of the Freemasons, which struggled to be recognized by the predominantly caucasian lodges. He recruited new members and contributed to the growth in the number of black Freemasons in Texas. Black lodges were not recognized by the predominantly caucasian grand lodges until the last decade of the 20th century. In 1875 Cuney was elected the first grand master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Ancient York Masons of the State of Texas (known today as the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Texas) organized by black Masons.Uzzel (2004), p. xii Cuney entered the race for Galveston mayor in 1875 but lost. He similarly lost bids for the state House of Representatives and Senate in 1876 and 1882, respectively. The latter election was after Reconstruction had officially ended in the South with the withdrawal of federal troops. Finally in 1883 Cuney was elected alderman of the twelfth district on the Galveston City Council. In 1882 Cuney was appointed to the higher position of special inspector for customs at the port. In 1883 he began a stevedore business, employing 500 black dock workers loading and unloading ships. He later organized the black dockworkers into a labor union known as the \\"Colored Screwmen's Benevolent Association\\".Obadele- Starks (2001), p. 39 At the time white unions controlled the labor market on the docks. Cuney pushed black workers to cross white picket lines and accept lower wages to increase the black presence on the docks and weaken white bargaining power against them. He recruited additional black dock workers from New Orleans.Obadele-Starks (2001), p. 40 Though inequities remained, the Trades Assembly was gradually forced to re-evaluate its racial policies and grant concessions. In 1889 Cuney was appointed as the US Collector of Customs for the port, the highest-ranking federal appointee position of a black in the late 19th-century South. In 1886 Cuney was elected as the Texas national committeeman in the Republican Party and became the Texas party chairman, the most powerful position of any African American in the South during that century. Cuney's popularity enabled him to shape the republican Party in Texas; his opponents, white and black, were initially unable to challenge his authority in most matters.Hare (1913), p. 174 His role and his importance became nationally recognized, and his accomplishments were reported by The New York Times. Cuney's elevation to the Texas Republican chairmanship aggravated some white Republicans in Texas and nationwide. Since Emancipation, many whites in the young Republican party had worried about alienating Southern whites if blacks were allowed to gain too much influence in the party. Although initially the power of the black vote was seen favorably by the party leaders, this sentiment gradually changed. At the 1888 Republican convention, a group of conservative whites attempted to have a number of important black leaders expelled, leading Cuney to coin the term Lily-White Movement to describe the trend. Cuney maintained control of the party in Texas for a time. The majority of the state's population was white, and most were affiliated with the Democratic Party. Some smaller planters and yeomen farmers joined the Republican Party. In 1892 Democratic politician Grover Cleveland was elected U.S. President, ending national support for Cuney's efforts. He was unseated in 1896 by a white as chairman of the Texas Republican party. Personal life On July 5, 1871, Cuney had married Adelina Dowdie, a local school teacher.Winegarten (1997), p. 20 Beautiful with grey eyes, she was also mixed race, the daughter of a mulatto enslaved mother and a white planter father.Hales (2003), Southern White and Black, p. 17 The couple had two children, Maud and Lloyd Garrison Cuney (the boy was named after prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts). The parents were both musical: Cuney played the violin and Adelina was a soprano singer. They filled their house with music and art, emphasized education for their children, had them learn Shakespeare, and worked to shelter them from the racism of Galveston society.Hales (2003), Southern White and Black, p. 18 With two of Cuney's brothers and their families nearby, the children and their cousins regularly enjoyed each other. The families organized frequent gatherings and events. Maud Cuney (later known as Maud Cuney Hare after her marriage), studied in Boston at the New England Conservatory of Music. She settled there, writing a biography of her father, published in 1913, and becoming an accomplished pianist, musicologist, author, and community organizer in the city. It had a relatively large population of blacks, many of them migrants from the South. Lloyd Cuney was also well educated; he became an official in the Congregational Church. Cuney amassed considerable wealth, attaining an estimated net worth of approximately $150,000 in 1893 ($ in today's dollars), according to The New York Times.. Legacy Some Texas historians refer to the period of the state between 1884 and 1896 as the \\"Cuney era\\". It is noted as a time of significant political gains by blacks in Texas. Cuney's efforts to recruit and register blacks contributed to a total of more than 100,000 blacks voting annually in the state during the 1890s (more than 15% of the black population or 4% of the total). The increased power of unionized black dock workers eventually led to interracial unions in Galveston during the decade from the 1890s to the early 1900s.Obadele-Starks (2001), pp. 43‚Äì44 By the time of Cuney's death, white conservative Democratic-dominated southern state legislatures were passing new constitutions and laws to disenfranchise blacks and poor white voters to expel them from politics and secure their dominance after having lost some offices in the biracial coalitions of Populists-Republicans at the end of the century. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, state legislatures created barriers to voter registration that resulted in dramatic reductions of voter rolls and nearly total exclusion of blacks from the political systems. For instance, Texas instituted required payment of poll taxes and restricting voting in the Democratic nominating process to white primaries. The number of black voters in Texas was sharply reduced from 100,000 in the 1890s to less than 5,000 in 1906. By the 1930s and the Great Depression, racial strife in the unions, in part encouraged by the employers as well as segregationists, had broken much of the former labor cooperation between blacks and whites.Obadele-Starks (2001), pp. 47‚Äì50 Cuney's example continued to inspire other black leaders. Following his being removed from the Texas Republican chairmanship, William M. McDonald, a black Fort Worth banker, formed an alliance with multimillionaire Edward H. R. Green to recapture the party. After blacks became disenfranchised and closed out of politics, from 1912 on the \\"Lily White Movement\\" dominated the Texas Republicans. Passage in the 1960s of federal civil rights laws was needed before Texas blacks fully recovered their ability to exercise their constitutional right to vote. Memorials Cuney Homes Cuney is the namesake for various places and organizations: *Wright Cuney Park is located between Broadway and Harborside Drive near the wharfs in Galveston. It is the site of the city's annual Juneteenth celebration of emancipation of African- American slaves. *The small town of Cuney, Texas, originally settled by freedmen, was named after Cuney Price, the son of H.L. Price, who incorporated the town. The younger Price (and thus the town) were named for Norris Wright Cuney. *The Order of the Eastern Star, Prince Hall Affiliated, renamed its Grand Chapter as the Norris Wright Cuney Grand Chapter of Texas (PHA). *Cuney Homes, a public housing complex owned and operated by the Houston Housing Authority (HHA), formerly Housing Authority of the City of Houston (HACH), was named for the politician.

The individual houses were designed in popular revivalist styles, including English Tudor, Colonial, and French Norman. The development was the first in Lake Forest to be planned and controlled entirely by its developer. History Turnbull and Anderson expanded their development multiple times after its opening. Turnbull purchased the McKinlock estate in 1928 for the First Addition. The Second Addition came in 1929-30, when Turnbull bought and redeveloped the Frank Hibbard Estate; only one house in this addition, at 380 Chiltern Drive, was designed by Anderson. Another house built by Turnbull at 965 Castlegate Court is just outside the First Addition and marked the northern entrance to the estate. The Great Depression bankrupted Turnbull and his development, and no new development occurred at the estates until the 1950s.

First founded in 1868 by Scottish cricketer James Pender Mollison (21 July 1844 - 22 November 1931) as the Yokohama Cricket Club. In 1884 members voted to absorb the Yokohama Foot Ball Club (Rugby Union), Athletics, Baseball and Tennis clubs to form the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club (YC&AC;) as it is now known. Sporting History=Cricket Although the first recorded cricket match in Japan was played in Yokohama on June 25, 1863 between a Royal Navy team and members of the local merchant community, the Yokohama Cricket Club was one of Japan's first organized cricket teams and was the center of many recreational and sporting facilities for English merchants living in Yokohama. The club's first facilities were at a location known as the Swamp Ground, but in 1870 the club moved to a larger 120 acre plot and played matches in a location that now hosts the Yokohama Stadium. Baseball By the 1880s sufficient numbers of American's had joined the club for baseball to supplant cricket in terms of popularity. Prior to the 1890s the club upheld restrictive membership policies that excluded the use of the club's facilities to Japanese nationals. Resentment of these rules and the extraterritoriality enjoyed by foreign nationals in the treaty ports prompted a formal challenge in 1891 by a team from Ichik≈ç, the elite University of Tokyo preparatory school. After five years of prevarication and delay, on the 29 May 1896 a historic match took place where the amateur YC&AC; club side was convincingly beaten 29 - 4. A hurriedly arranged rematch on June 5, led to further humiliation for the club, with a loss of 32 - 9 to the less experienced Japanese high school team. After one further defeat of 22 - 6, players from the visiting US Navy ship USS Olympia were drafted to assist, and a narrow consolation victory for the club of 14 - 12 was achieved. As one of the first truly international baseball matches to be played in Japan, where a local team 'beat the foreigners at their own game', the Ichik≈ç high school team was lauded in the contemporary press as national heroes. News of this victory greatly contributed to the popularity of baseball as a school sport in Japan. Rugby Union The club's rugby activities include the Gareth MacFadyen Cup, a perpetual local derby-style memorial rugby union match contested on an annual basis since 2001 in Tokyo between the Tokyo Crusaders and the Yokohama Country and Athletic Club. Association Football Association Football (or Soccer) was introduced in to the club on December 25th, 1886, for training sessions starting from January 1887. The first official football match in Japan is widely believed to have been held on February 18, 1888 between the YC&AC; and Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club. Yokohama Country & Athletic Club is the oldest running football club in Japan. Current Facilities In 1910 the club vacated its facilities in downtown Yokohama and relocated to an elevated site at Yaguchidai close to the current Yamate Station on the JR East Negishi Line. Current facilities provide for a wide variety of indoor and outdoor sports including tennis, rugby, cricket, football, squash, swimming and basketball.Article about Japanese cricket Sports Bowling (Ten Pin), Baseball, Basketball, Billiards (Pool), Cricket, Darts, Field Hockey, Golf, Lawn Bowls, Rugby, Soccer, Squash Tennis, Table Tennis, Swimming, Volleyball, Logo http://www.ycac.or.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/maxx- wp/images/icons/YCAC150th.png See also *Club of Pioneers ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Cricket in Japan Category:Sports teams in Yokohama ","title":"Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club"},{"id":"24602799","text":"Our Father Who Art in the Tree is a 2002 debut novel by Australian writer Judy Pascoe.

Biography = Early life and early career Michiko was born in Bromsgrove, England to a Japanese mother and an English father. She moved to Kobe, Japan at the age of two in 1987, but returned to England in 1995 after the Great Hanshin earthquake. Determined to be a singer, she performed in an acoustic duo before returning to Japan when she was 18. The following year, she met Tomokazu Matsuzawa, producer for acts such as Mika Nakashima, Miliyah Kato, Soulhead, and Chemistry. The pair worked together for three years developing her talent before MiChi entered Japan's dance club scene. In March 2007, she released the track \\"Surrender\\" on a dance compilation titled Freedom House Mode Collection. It was followed a year later with her independently released English language album Michi Madness, which entered the Japanese Oricon weekly albums chart, but only peaked at number 148.  Up To You  Later in 2008 she officially debut under Sony Music Entertainment and produced her first single titled \\"Promise,\\" peaking at number 12 on the Oricon weekly charts.

It was painted in 1877, and displayed the same year at an exhibition now generally referred to as the third Impressionist exhibition. The picture is large by Pissarro's measure, and he described the effort of painting it as the ‚Äòwork of a benedictine‚Äô. Pissarro was proud of the painting, and it remained in his family's possession until 1913. It presently hangs in the National Gallery, London.National Gallery, London. The C√¥te des B≈ìufs at L‚ÄôHermitage.  Location  In 1872 Pissarro moved for the second time to the commune of Pontoise some twenty miles north-west of Paris, where he lived with his family until 1884. The rolling hills of the close-by neighbourhood of L‚ÄôHermitage provided the setting for a large number of Pissarro's paintings during his stays at Pontoise. The C√¥te des B≈ìufs (‚Äòcattle ridge‚Äô) is a steep hill face just north of the River Oise, and just west of the rue de L‚ÄôHermitage‚Äîthe Departmental road passing through the neighbourhood. The name is acquired from a hillside pathway called the sente des Boves (‚Äòcattle snicket‚Äô‚ÄîBoves being a Latin word, translating into French as B≈ìufs). From this location in particular Pissarro painted scenes on five occasions in three different decades.Camille Pissarro, Impressionism, Landscape and Rural Labour, Richard Thompson, The South Bank Centre and The Herbert Press Limited, London, 1990, isbn 1853320528\\\\. p. 112.Pissarro, Fran√ßoise Cachin, Anne Distel, Christopher Lloyd, Barbara Stern Shapiro, John Walsh Jr., The Arts Council of Great Britain and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1980, isbn 0728702614\\\\. p. 110.  Composition, colour, and texture  Paysage en long, 1879. Pissarro's picture of a view up the hillside, his striking ranks of tree trunks and the lines of the buildings, as well as the atypically vertical format of this landscape painting, all create a strongly vertical dynamic. The sloping lines of the undergrowth, rooftops and hilltop contrast with the upward thrust of the work, but this contrast is toned down by the presence of the trees, which veil‚Äî almost screening off‚Äîthe middle-distance, causing the viewer's eye to skid across the surface of the composition. The confident presentment of triangular gables climbing the hill shows some of the influence Paul C√©zanne's technique of emphatic spatial compression, though Pissarro applies it without the aggression associated with C√©zanne's method. Open sky appears to the top right of the picture, in the direction of which the branches of trees reach, echoing the lines of the gables.Pissarro, Christopher Lloyd, Phaidon Press Ltd., London, reprinted 2006, isbn 0714827290\\\\. p. 70.Camille Pissarro, Compiled and introduced by Mikhail Guerman, translated by Mark Ashworth, Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1973, isbn 569084431\\\\. p. 8. Details: different textural applications. Pissarro's method of implying depth in this taut and confined picture relies in part on the careful control of light, colour and contrast. Throughout the painting, combinations in close proximity of different colours and tones are observed. At the foreground, physically neighbouring colours and tones are at their darkest and most densely compact. This use of immediate‚Äîsometimes incongruous‚Äîcontrasts has an exaggerative effect on the foreground's strong colour saturation; itself a component in the effect of aerial perspective. In addition to this local differentiating of the range and compactness of contrasting pigments, Pissarro also variegated the work in a more general way; the predominant colour at the foreground is green, and as the picture recedes, the use of greens is gradually discounted and hues of red are subtly amplified. Just after the completion of this painting, Pissarro made prints such as his Paysage en long, and Paysage sous bois, √† l‚ÄôHermitage (both 1879) wherein he experimented with similar methods of deploying degrees of light and contrast to denote depth.Camille Pissarro, Impressionism, Landscape and Rural Labour, Richard Thompson, The South Bank Centre and The Herbert Press Limited, London, 1990, isbn 1853320528\\\\. p. 40. The surface of The C√¥te des B≈ìufs at L‚ÄôHermitage is heavily worked. In many parts of the painting, brush-strokes are applied over dried and hardened earlier layers of paint. In some places such as in the tree trunks, these layers appear as having been being applied in long and sometimes thin strokes of parallel‚Äîor near parallel‚Äîdirections. Sometimes the more lightly applied later layers are seen skipping along the peaks and valleys of an earlier layer. Although Pissarro went to these lengths to effect a particular textural plasticity at the painted surface, he did not always extend this in such a way as to fully represent the actual plasticity of the trees‚Äîgoing so far in some areas as to paint them with no clearly defined edges.Museum of Modern Art. C√©zanne and Pissarro, Layering the Paint. Paysage sous bois, √† l‚ÄôHermitage, 1879. In other areas such as that of undergrowth to the fore, shorter strokes have been criss-crossed, creating an effect not unlike that of a woven fabric. In addition to this labour-intensive technique of layer-building, Pissarro used the more traditional method of applying paint with impasto to consolidate the picture's texture. The technique of painting kaleidoscopically criss-crossing areas has the effect of attracting the eye and drawing it into the pattern, but the price of achieving this is the apparent submerging of details‚Äîsuch as those of the two people ambling down the hill‚Äîbeneath impasto and contending colours.Pissarro, Christopher Lloyd, Phaidon Press Ltd., London, reprinted 2006, isbn 0714827290\\\\. p. 10. The critic Charles Ephrussi commented in 1880 on the ‚Äòdoughy, fleecy, tormented surface‚Äô of Pissarro's work, and this imprisoning of matter beneath motif displeased Pissarro, who frequently complained that his method was lacking in visual clarity.Camille Pissarro, Impressionism, Landscape and Rural Labour, Richard Thompson, The South Bank Centre and The Herbert Press Limited, London, 1990, isbn 1853320528\\\\. p. 40.  Painting materials  Pissarro's handling of colour in this painting is intricate as is described in the above paragraph but his palette is rather limited. The subdued tonal structure was not achieved by the use of dull earth colours but by mixing pure strong pigments such as ultramarine, vermilion, emerald green and chrome yellow.Bomford D, Kirby J, Leighton, J., Roy A. Art in the Making: Impressionism. National Gallery Publications, London, 1990, pp. 158-165. In the last stages Pissarro added strong accents of pure ultramarine and vermilion in small areas of the painting.Camille Pissarro, 'The C√¥te des Boeufs at L'Hermitage' at ColourLex  History of the painting  Much of Pissarro's work from the 1860s and early 1870s was characteristically light, airy and panoramic, such as his painting of 1864-5, The Banks of the Marne at Chennevi√®res. With the Montfoucault works of the middle 1870s, Pissarro turned to explore a narrower theme of peasant rurality, and with the wooded sous bois (‚Äòundergrowth‚Äô) landscapes of the late 1870s, this quest for intimacy further constricted and darkened.Pissarro, His Life and Works, Ralph E. Shikes and Paula Harper, Horizon Press, New York, 1980, isbn 0818001283\\\\. p. 130.Camille Pissarro, Christopher Lloyd, Editions d‚ÄôArt Albert Skira S.A., Geneva, first published by Macmillan London Ltd., isbn 0333319087\\\\. p. 79. In spite of this aesthetic contraction, some of the sous bois paintings were quite large and The C√¥te des B≈ìufs at L‚ÄôHermitage is in fact one of Pissarro's largest paintings.Camille Pissarro, Joachim Pissarro, Harry N. Abrams Inc., 1993, isbn 0810937247\\\\. p. 121. The densely treated surface, the extensive use of tone, the fragmented and overlaying strokes, and the theme of buildings seen through a screen of trees are all characteristic of his work at the end of the 1870s, and the abstractly and closely conceived internal rhythms are very remote from the clear air of the earlier pictures.Pissarro, Fran√ßoise Cachin, Anne Distel, Christopher Lloyd, Barbara Stern Shapiro, John Walsh Jr., The Arts Council of Great Britain and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1980, isbn 0728702614\\\\. p. 110. The Banks of the Marne at Chennevi√®res, 1864-5. In 1877 what is now known as the third Impressionist exhibition (though it was not then so-called) was held in Paris. There exists in the exhibition catalogue a record that a painting by Pissarro entitled Le verger, c√¥te Saint-Denis, √† Pontoise was displayed in the third gallery of the exhibition. This painting is almost certainly The C√¥te des B≈ìufs at L‚ÄôHermitage. Among those viewing at the exhibition were the Impressionist apologist Georges Rivi√®re, who described it as ‚Äòa large landscape by Pissarro‚Äô, and the critic Amed√©e Descubes who remarked on the ‚Äòattractive painting, a small house hidden away in the forest, which struck us by the firmness and simplicity of its brushwork‚Äô.Camille Pissarro, Impressionism, Landscape and Rural Labour, Richard Thompson, The South Bank Centre and The Herbert Press Limited, London, 1990, isbn 1853320528\\\\. pp. 345-346. Pride of place in the third gallery at the exhibition was given to Pierre-Auguste Renoir‚Äôs Bal du moulin de la Galette, and The C√¥te des B≈ìufs at L‚ÄôHermitage was displayed next to it. The rude and wintry hillside features, the anonymous peasant figures, and the worked and reworked surface of the Pissarro landscape are in dramatic contrast with the neighbouring Renoir painting's fleeting display of a summertime dance in Paris. A modern conception of Impressionism frequently puts a premium on the swift or improvised application of paint to the canvas, but this important characteristic is clearly absent in Pissarro's laboriously constructed picture. The close proximity of these two works, painted by two artists then recognised to be at the centre of the movement now called Impressionism, graphically highlighted the artistic tensions native to the Impressionist school. Paul C√©zanne, The Orchard, C√¥te Saint-Denis, 1877. The same year Pissarro painted The C√¥te des B≈ìufs at L‚ÄôHermitage, his friend Paul C√©zanne painted his The Orchard, C√¥te Saint-Denis. The two artists had been friends for many years and had collaborated on a large number of works between 1865 and 1885. This C√©zanne painting was also displayed, along with Pissarro's C√¥te des B≈ìufs and Renoir's Bal and other paintings, in the third gallery at the exhibition, but it was listed in the catalogue simply as being one of four examples of C√©zanne's Paysage; Etude d‚Äôapr√®s nature.The New Painting, Impressionism 1874-1886, The Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, isbn 0884010473\\\\. pp. 194, 195, 204, 206\\\\. (The chapter beginning p. 189, The \\"First\\" Exhibition of Impressionist Painters, written by Richard R. Brettell) Although the place-names in the latterly adopted titles of both the C√©zanne painting and the Pissarro painting refer to the same location, it is not clear that both paintings actually show exactly the same spot. However, a number of very obvious themes such as those of the strongly coloured roof tiles, the precipitously dropping hillside, and of buildings seen through trees, are common to both pictures.The Paintings of Paul C√©zanne, John Rewald, A Catalogue Raisonn√©, Volume 1, The Texts, Harry N.

In 1923 when the painting was in the possession of the Knoedler Gallery (London), the artist Walter Sickert wrote, \\"The large canvas by Pissarro entitled La C√¥te des Boeufs, with its beautiful and highly complicated intricacies of design, its solidity of architecture, and a certain human warmth and tenderness, is perhaps as important an example of this insufficiently appreciated painter‚Äôs work as any that exists. A writer is to-day almost afraid to use of a work of art the term \\"laborious\\". He would probably be supposed to imply depreciation, or to be indulging in the irony that is almost de rigueur. But the charm of a picture like this lies chiefly in its immense and indefatigable laboriousness, in labour so cunning, so swift and so patient, that the more it is piled up, the greater the clarity and simplicity of the result. \\"Un travail de B√©n√©dictin,\\" as I have heard himself call it.\\"French Pictures at Knoedler‚Äôs Gallery.

In 1913, the artist's wife, Julie Pissarro, sold the painting to the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, who in turn sold to it to Knoedler (of Old Bond Street, London) in 1920.

Serving in the French Air Service, he was the oldest ace in the war, scoring his fifth (and sixth) victories when he was 43 years of age.The Aerodrome website Retrieved 4 August 2020. Early life d'Aische was born in Brussels in 1874. He was a scion (lineal descendant) of Walloon nobility whose lineage dated back to the 15th century. d'Aische moved to the Belgian Congo when his father opposed his desire to study engineering and attempted to arrange a suitable bride for his son. In 1904, he enlisted in the French Foreign Legion where he learnt to speak German and became a French citizen. d'Aische was living in Paris and working as an engineer when the Great War began in August 1914.Guttman, Jon. Reconnaissance and Bomber Aces of World War One. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015. p14-15 First World War d'Aische enlisted in the French army in 1914 and fought as an infantryman, seeing action on the Marne, the Argonne and at Vauquois. He was wounded in action in April 1915. After his recovery, he enlisted in the French A√©ronautique Militaire in July 1915, first serving as a mechanic at the Avord aviation school and later training to be an observer/gunner at Cazaux. d'Aische, with the rank of Corporal, was assigned to an operational unit, Escadrille F.71, in April 1916 which was based at Commercy near Saint-Mihiel. The unit was assigned to fly reconnaissance duties for the VIII French army corps at Verdun. The unit was equipped with Farman F40 two-seaters and d'Aische, flying as an observer with a pilot named Pierre Weiss, achieved his first confirmed aerial victory when he shot down a German Albatros over Varvinay on 22 May 1916. In January 1917, F.71 was transferred to Sainte-Menehould to support General Nivelle's coming spring offensive at Chemin des Dames. The squadron received the Salmson SM1 three-seat bombers and the unit experienced considerable action during this period. In early June, the SM1s were replaced with British-built Sopwith 1A2 two-seaters. On 3 June, d'Aische and pilot Jacques Fontaine were flying a patrol in a Sopwith when they were attacked by five German fighters. DuBois reported that he destroyed two of the enemy fighters and damaged a third which force-landed but he was officially credited with only one victory. In July 1917, the unit received the new Dorand AR1 two-seaters. On the 24th of that month, d'Aische and a pilot named Henri Betis flew a Dorand accompanied by three others on a patrol over German lines. Attacked by seven German fighters from above, one Dorand was shot down and another was damaged and forced to retreat, a third Dorand flying alongside as escort. Now on their own, Dubois and Betis fought off the German attackers, d'Aische, manning a Lewis machine-gun, shooting down two of them. However their Dorand was badly damaged and Betis was wounded. They managed to reach Allied territory before crash-landing. Betis later died of his injuries but d'Aische survived unhurt. For this exploit, d'Aische was promoted to Sergeant. Later in the summer of 1917, F71 was issued with three-seat Letord 1A3s and it was whilst flying as an observer in one of these that he achieved his final two victories. On 22 September, accompanied by pilot Jacques Fontaine and rear-seat gunner Lt Marcel Meunier, d'Aische destroyed an Albatros fighter over Cernay-en-Dormois and an enemy two-seater over Vouziers in a single sortie. Awarded the military medal, d'Aische was now officially an ace and, at the age of 43, was the oldest ace of the Great War. d'Aische wanted to become a pilot and he managed to secure a waiver on the normal age limit of 30 to train as a pilot. He left F71 in December 1917 and commenced his pilots training, securing his brevet in June 1918. However whilst undergoing advanced operational training in October 1918, he was injured in an accidental crash whilst piloting a SPAD fighter. The war ended the following month and d'Aische was demobilized in December 1918.Guttman, Jon. p. 15‚Äì16. Later life d'Aische worked in civil aviation in the inter-war period. He lived in France during the German Occupation in the Second World War. His ability to speak German saw him employed by the occupiers as a translator and administrator until he was caught passing on information to the French Resistance. Imprisoned by the Germans, he survived to be liberated by the Allies in 1944. He spent the remainder of his life employed as a Municipal Councillor.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of developed land as part of: new developments; cleaning up contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or public open space such as urban open space used by urban parks, community gardens; or larger open space reserves such as regional parks. Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of xenobiotic hazardous substances from historical previous uses or in situ land pollution, causing soil contamination and groundwater pollution, may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as brownfields.  Types of Land Recycling = Adaptive Building  The most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. Adaptive building is the development of an old abandoned building to repurpose it into a new building design and/or new purpose. Saving the old buildings and reusing the materials within the buildings is considered more environmentally sustainable than building all new structure with new materials. This repurposing of materials in the existing adaption or to a different building site could include wood, metals, roofing, brick, etc. and would provide products for new projects to prevent excessive waste. Site disruptions are also decreased due to less destruction and building. The adaptive process also provides a more sustainable way to promote environmentally friendly infrastructure. It also reduces the amount of pollutants that can contaminate the soil and water around the abandoned building. This can be particularly beneficial when repurposing buildings which are near schools, residential neighborhoods, or other workplaces by mitigating occupational hazards from such contaminants commonly found in construction. This is also thought of to be more economic friendly, including direct and indirect cost savings to the construction company and to the building owner. The cost of producing new materials and the services that come with manufacturing these products are much more costly thanrepurposing existing buildings.  Brownfield Redevelopment The EPA classifies a brownfield as \\"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields, which when improved have been shown to improve the surrounding environmental stress. Funding for these hazardous sites may be obtained through the EPA's Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program which empowers municipalities, landholders, and land developers to safely clean up and repurpose the land.  Non-Infrastructure Redevelopment  Land Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent. Benefits The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include: * Social and economic revitalization * Sustainability * An alternative to sprawl * Direction of development to urban cores * Addressing climate change  Treatment of brownfields  The US Government Accountability Office estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004 These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate and unattractive spaces within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes sustainable development, and preserves precious resources. Social and economic revitalization Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering community spirit, creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues. The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and environmental health. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxins and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment. By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of businesses and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of poverty, creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much- needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.  An alternative to sprawl  Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing urban sprawl and unplanned, low-density, automobile-dependent developments. Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog. By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center. Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources. Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce vehicle use and carbon dependence. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them. Directing development to urban cores Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities. Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing. Addressing climate change Land recycling effectively curbs greenhouse-gas emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces vehicle dependence. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change. A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent Urban Land Institute. Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change. Available at because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.  Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification  LEED Gold Plaque in a Certified Building the green movement has started to emphasize the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources. LEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability . In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends. Sustainability  Sustainability involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes smart growth and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, of undeveloped land is conserved. Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials . As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.  Sustainable Land Remediation and Planning  ZETOR building before demolition - inserted here as an example of buildings which are demolished for land reuse Land development is an aspect of land recycling which involves urbanization and development of land, by reusing previously abandoned and unused land in commercial areas of larger cities. Sustainable Remediation is an aspect of land development where there is an increased focus the costs and benefits of certain aspects of land recycling. It aims to look at land remediation holistically considering not just the current environmental implications but also the long term social and economic implications. Co-design, is much more intentional and focuses on a multitude solutions by completing cost-benefit analyses, engaging in more inclusive conversations with stakeholders along with environmental impacts like energy and resources which may be consumed during land recycling projects. The Society of American Military Engineers have focused on using policy implemented by the American department of defense to ensure more sustainable practices. Looking more specifically some efforts being implemented by the S.A.M.E include composition of a sustainability remediation tool which allows for estimates of specific technologies to be considered when analyzing land remediation. Planning and design for land development and transformation by using co-design has resulted in better shared information on systems. These have worked well on sustainable land development as well as improved communication and handling of barriers, ultimately creating a better integrated program on a global scale. It has been used in cities in Australia as part of global urban research programs to create land remediation solutions. The overall process involves four phases which included co-design which resulted in outcomes for policy and practice, research and knowledge and solution development. In this case, the sustainable remediation framework was created and used to create better co-design processes starting small scale locally and extending out to global scales. The process was split into three components starting with assisting in creating urban goals on each level of the scale which align with world views and influence, the policies which are in place and finally, to local technology and knowledge. Then shifting to look at how the urban goals affect urban systems like finances, environmental, and social capital as well as more physical systems like energy and water. Allowing better understanding of the costs and benefits of different land remediation goals. Then the process then looks more long term and focuses on the outcomes over time to understand the overarching effects of the implemented land remediation goals. Finally, the process looks at the major parts of the framework which need to be improved or need more focus. Striving for sustainable development goals to create more sustainable cities A push for sustainable land remediation can be seen all over the world, when looking at urban planning and can also be connected to large public health scares or changes in social norms. In the UK after cholera outbreaks in the 19th century, people started to pay more attention to the way homes were being built and where they were being built. Now as urbanization has increased, the push is for using land which has already been partially or completely developed and transforming it into something different. The inclusion of garden cities, which are cities built with the intention of avoiding disrupting previously present natural ecosystems. An example is the Hampstead Garden Suburb which began formulating plans that focused on preservation of natural beauty in the area by avoiding the removal of plant life that was already there and working to build around it. This also spread to other countries in Europe with Germany building its first garden city in 1909 and Canberra in Australia where the main goal was to reestablish and maintain forest cover around the city. Later, Design with Nature written by Ian McHarg, influenced a lot of the sustainable development goals which were implemented all over the world. In the US, a city beautification movement started in the early 20th century, many cities were redeveloped as part of the movement but Chicago was the most influenced. As the city was being physical improved they found that there was a need for more focus on development and its social implications. As time went on there were also more conversations about the influence that people have on their environment with more literature about the effects of environmental degradation became more mainstream. This allowed more intersectional land development goals to be implemented when looking at the different needs of people in different countries. Challenges While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges. Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or greenfields, remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include: * market factors * environmental-liability risks * uncertainty and cost * complicated/confusing regulatory requirements * difficulty in obtaining project financing * the lure of greenfields Market factors As the saying goes, in real estate only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites. =Greenfields competition= Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called greenfield land. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development. Brownfields As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a brownfield site is ‚Äúreal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant‚Äù. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination. Brownfield Remediation Brownfield sites are not being repurposed or reused because of the amount of toxins left over from urban industrialization. These sites can cause serious health risks to a large number of people. Since these sites have a high levels of land contamination, there is a high cost of remediation. Processes to reduce land contamination, either physical or chemical technologies can also cause more infectivity and loss of land function. Nature-based solutions is an idea being talked about to produce a more environmental space. Nature-based solutions can be looked at as policies and approaches to environmental issues that are in benefit to human health and biodiversity. These nature-based solutions promote environmentally friendly strategies instead of your regular industrial approaches that have climate hazards. An example would include developing a permeable green area, from these brownfield sites. Phytoremediation is another environmentally friendly approach for brownfield remediation. Phytoremediation programs reduce contaminants in the soil, water and air through planting different types of plants. Important metals that are harmful to human health, such as selenium, zinc, nickel and iron, are removed from contaminated soil through this process. These procedures are inexpensive because the plants rely on sunlight and the recycled nutrients in the ground. Although, phytoremediation cannot be used the same way in every destination due to different types of plants being nurtured differently in different types of environments. It depends on the soil, where the plant is placed, if it is getting enough nutrients to thrive, etc. The plants end up being so greatly polluted from heavy metals that they need to be disposed of. Thermal treatment is used as a disposal option. Thermal treatment implicates the combustion of the waste materials through machines that produce high enough temperatures, which decomposes the organic molecules within the plant. This treatment is typically used in the residential and industrial scale, making it useful for brownfield sites. =Uncertainty and costs= Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo. =Project financing= Obtaining private front- end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process. Since financing is more readily available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over. = Environmental Justice = The concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination. Environmental-liability risks Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or ‚Äúmothball‚Äù a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability. =Regulatory requirements= The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals. Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.  Gentrification  Because most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.  Global Land Recycling = Developed Countries  Land Recycling in the EU = An in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling. The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems. Beginning with research, a database maintained by the Copernicus Programme is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA). Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure. For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators. The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets. The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries. The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved. = Land Recycling in Germany = depiction of soil relating to the way in which land use can affect soil quality On a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30 ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy. They also incentivized urban development and improvement by making it easier for contractors to obtain permits to develop urban areas. Studies were done to see the effectiveness of the implementation of this policy by looking at Stralsund. The city was chosen for its ability to be developed as a mostly rural part of Germany as well as for its appeal for not only younger families looking for in expensive places to settle but also for companies looking for places to develop. The land development of Stralsund was then monitored from 1992 to 2018, the focus of development started with industrialization of the outskirts of the town, then brownfield transformation and finally, residential development. Cost benefit also played a big role in the conversion of pieces of land which hadn't been in use for a long period of time like, a military property. As development continued, there was also compensation for interference with ecosystems and natural spaces by addition of green spaces and by planting trees. When comparing both the old land use plan and the new land use plan, they found that the cost of the new had the potential to save 55% of costs, but ultimately there wasn't much change between the results of the old and the new land use plans. The application of an accelerated inner urban development plan was neither advantageous nor non-advantageous, for Stralsund, Germany, because of the previous structure of the policy. The country of Germany also had goals to reach land degradation neutrality by 2030 by reaching its sustainable development goals specifically based on soil improvement. Germany has focused a lot on brownfield development as much of Europe with that including not just contaminated land but also land which was previously developed. The push for target amounts of recycled land stems from status quo influence with other countries development of brownfield mitigation work. In Leipzig, Germany improvement of land and community quality was done by creating more urban forestry. With increased research of the people‚Äôs response to the improved brownfields generally quality of life was improved. Some research shows that the greenspaces though positive needed to be made more useable for improvement of quality of life. Mainly stakeholders have a say in the way greenspace is allocated in Germany, so there is more of a push to ensure policy matches with what is beneficial for the people who would be using greenspaces not just in Germany but in other European countries.  Land Recycling Programs in the United States = Pennsylvania  In Pennsylvania a land recycling program was established to promote the voluntary clean up and reuse of contaminated sites. This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups.  Examples = Ghirardelli Square  Ghirardelli Square is in San Francisco, California and is the center of many examples of land recycling and building reuse. Designed by Lawrence Halprin and William Wurster opening in 1964, this was one of the first examples of major land recycling in the United States. Surrounding this square is many buildings and waterfront properties that were originally used for production of local goods as well as transportation through the bay. No longer needed for their original uses, these buildings have been transformed and retrofitted to accommodate the needs of the community and attract tourism. The inclusion of new retail spaces, offices, and residential properties in these existing abandoned buildings not only put to use otherwise empty spaces but also prevent the erection of new structures and therefore use less materials, energy, and land. In addition to this, Ghirardelli Square also shows the change of building use to reflect the needs of the residents. Churches specifically have changed from predominantly Christian to other religious uses or convert into secular uses such as housing and businesses.  Foundation Hotel  Foundation Hotel in Detroit, Michigan The Foundation Hotel in Detroit, Michigan is an Adaptive reuse project designed by local firm McIntosh Poris Associates (MPA) with collaboration with Simone Deary Design group. This project actually combined two adjacent buildings that were not in use. The main building was built in 1929 and originally housed the city‚Äôs oldest fire department. The additional building was once home to Pontchartrain Wine Cellars. In 2013 the fire department moved out and the building was left unoccupied for over a year until bought by Aparium Hotel Group. This project focused on the new needs of the community while still preserving the aesthetic and incorporated Historic preservation in their work. This is significant because as stated above, gentrification can be a major negative effect during land recycling and the attempt to maintain the existing exterior of the building counteracts this.  Wonder Bread Factory  Washington, D.C.‚Äôs Wonder Bread Factory sat in Shaw neighborhood from early 1913 to the mid 1980s in full production. After the company moved out of the space the building was abandoned and vacant for almost 20 years until Douglas Development, founded by Douglas Jemal, bought it in 1997. The building sat vacant for another 15 years until it was redeveloped and converted it into offices in 2013. This building also pulled on Historic preservation by minimizing the level of exterior renovation as much as possible while still creating a new use for a space that was highly needed in the community. This building is 98,000 square feet and is now Loft styles offices available to the public.

It is the second game in the Entdecker trilogy of games, a series of games featuring the mechanics of Teuber's previous game, Entdecker, adapted to new themes. Unlike the previous game, Realm of the Jade Goddess, Desert Sons was available for a wide release, though there are no plans to publish the game outside of the original German language. However, a computer implementation has been available on the Catan GmbH website, with a full English language translation. Desert Sons is considered to be the middle game in terms of complexity in the trilogy, roughly on par with the original Entdecker.  Gameplay  The game takes place on a board 11 tiles wide by 11 tiles tall. Initially, only the tiles in the middle row and column are uncovered. Each tile consists of portions of desert and oasis, with connecting lines in brown or white through the centers of each tile (brown through desert portions and white through oasis portions). In addition, oasis portions may contain \\"action icons\\", which are used in the game. Each player begins the game with a camel representing the player's caravan, and four explorers of different heights. The heights of explorers of different players are also different, but such that the total height of a player's four explorers are the same. At the start of the turn, players place their camels on the first or last tiles on the middle row or column, with each player placing their camel on different tiles. Each player is also given one tile in reserve, and two water stones, which act as the game's currency. At the start of each turn, the player may first move their camel. Camels may freely move along the brown lines, but must stop once the camel moves over a white line; once per game, a player may pay one water stone in order to freely move the camel along the white lines. Camels may not be placed on tiles where occupied by other camels, but may move over them. If the camel ends at a location facing unexplored terrain (where no tile exists), discovery occurs and the player may either draw a tile and place it or place a tile from their reserve. Once per game, the player may also pay one water stone to place a tile from another player's reserve (the player then draws a new tile and place it in their reserve). Tiles placed must be adjacent to the camel's position, such that the lines connecting it to neighboring tiles are of the same color, and such that tiles placed on the edge of the game board are placed with the desert sides out (as if the edge of the board has a brown connecting line); if no such placement is possible the tile is placed in the player's reserve, and the player's turn ends. If a new tile is placed, the camel is then moved to the newly discovered tile. If the tile is entirely composed of desert, the player may move the caravan again and place tiles, if necessary. After discovery occurs, the players may either place an explorer on the newly discovered tile, or remove an explorer already on the board. Explorers must be placed on oasis sections of tiles, and may not be placed on the same portion as an action icon. Oases are considered complete if they are entirely surrounded by desert or the edge of the game board, when they are scored. If there are at least two explorers (even if they belong to the same player) in the completed oasis, the player with the tallest explorer must pay one water stone or remove the explorer from further scoring. Each explorer then claims an action icon by order of their height; if there are not enough action icons for all the explorers the remainder get nothing. Then, after each player then takes the action indicated by the action icon, the explorers are returned to the player's reserves. (As all explorers are of different heights, one explorer is always taller than the others. To counteract this, one player is given the turban, which is assigned to the player's tallest explorer. The explorer with the turban is always considered to be the tallest regardless of its actual height, and the turban is passed around when the explorer with the turban is involved in the scoring of an oasis.) Action icons allow players to earn water stones, claim one of four merchandise items and place it in their caravans (which initially may hold four items), expand the capacity of their caravan by two items, or place a \\"rumor tile\\" on a small board. If in the event a player with a full caravan claims a merchandise item, they may discard the newly acquired merchandise item or discard a caravan item to make room. Rumor tiles add or subtract the victory point value of each item of merchandise by up to two points. There are six rumor tiles, but only two rumor tiles may be assigned to a particular merchandise item. Players may look at a rumor tile when they are placed, but they are placed face-down on a special rumor board that keeps track of the merchandise values. If all six rumor tiles are in place and a player chooses a rumor tile action, they may remove a rumor tile, which can be replaced by a later rumor tile action. Once per game, the player may pay one water stone to take a second turn at the conclusion of their turn. The game ends when the last tile is played, and one last turn is taken by each player. The rumor tiles are turned face-up, and the player with the greatest total value of merchandise wins, with the number of water stones as a tiebreaker.

Kwaku Duren (born April 14, 1943; a.k.a., Robert Donaldson Duren and Bob D. Duren) is a controversial African American former lawyer, educator, writer, editor, Black Panther, long-time social, political and community activist; and a former convict who now lives and practices law in South Central Los Angeles. He has run for United States Congress three times and once for Vice President of the United States.New York psychologist and independent party activist Lenora Fulani ran for President of the U.S. in 1988 on the New Alliance/Peace and Freedom Party ticket. The campaign was historic inasmuch as she was the first woman and first African American to run for president and achieve ballot access in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. As a result, she received over one million dollars in matching federal funds. Fulani chose seven vice-presidential candidates to run with her, including a Latina, a gay man, a Native American woman, and two African Americans (Duren and Mamie Moore). As a young man, he spent nearly five years in California prisons for armed robbery.Duren, 1976, p. 108. He began reading extensively and taking college classes while incarcerated and after his parole in the fall of 1970, he founded and chaired the National Poor People's Congress. A couple of years later, he and his younger sister, Betty Scott, along with Mary Blackburn and other community activists, founded an alternate school ‚Äì the Intercommunal Youth Institute (1972‚Äì1975) ‚Äì in Long Beach, California. In the wake of the shooting death of his sister by a California Highway Patrol officer during a routine traffic stop, Duren helped found and was a co-chair of the Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA) from 1975‚Äì77. From 1976 to 1981 he was the Coordinator of the Southern California Chapter of the Black Panther Party (SCC/BPP). From 1979 until 1991 he worked for the Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, beginning as a Community Outreach Worker; later, as a paralegal and attorney; he was one of the founding members and first president of the Union of Legal Services Workers of Los Angeles (AFL-CIO/UAW). Duren attended law school at the Peoples College of Law in Los Angeles. He graduated in fall of 1989 and was admitted to the California State Bar on August 8, 1990.California State Bar membership records He has worked as a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs‚Äù lawyer and community activist in South Central Los Angeles ever since. A founding member of Community Services Unlimited, Inc., he was its Executive Director from 1977‚Äì2008. As Chairman of the New Panther Vanguard Movement ‚Äì since 1994 ‚Äì Duren was co-editor-in-chief, with his ex-wife, Neelam Sharma, of The Black Panther International News Service, a quarterly newspaper published in Los Angeles from 1995 to 2001. Early life B. Kwaku Duren was born in Beckley, West Virginia, the hometown of his father, William Preston ‚ÄúBrack‚Äù Duren, and his mother, Willie Wade Bennett. Duren is the only son in a family of four children. His father worked as a miner, a prizefighter, and a steel mill worker. During the Second World War, when Duren was an infant, his parents moved to Cleveland, Ohio. They lived in various places around Cleveland until settling into some new ‚Äúhousing projects.\\" His mother was a housewife for many years but also worked as a housekeeper and seamstress. When ‚ÄúBrack‚Äù Duren had his hand severely mauled in an industrial accident at Midland Steel (he lost two-and-a-half fingers of his right hand), and the company dismissed him with a tiny settlement, Willie Duren was forced to seek work cleaning the houses of whites to help support her family. In 1959, Duren's mother relocated from Cleveland to Long Beach, California. Her husband followed his family to Long Beach shortly thereafter. In 1960, Brack Duren was arrested in a house raid by the FBI and charged with committing armed robberies of illegal gambling joints in Cleveland, which he had done after being injured and unable to find work. He was extradited to Ohio where he served many years in Chillicothe Correctional Institution before becoming a jailhouse lawyer, doing research on his own case (with the help of his eldest daughter, Joyce), appealing, and ultimately winning his release on a technicality. He rejoined and remarried his wife after his release from prison and lived the remainder of his life in Long Beach. At the age of 17 years, Kwaku Duren was arrested for breaking and entering into a television shop. He served six months in an L.A. county jail facility before being placed on probation. Following his release he worked in a pool hall in Long Beach, sold drugs, and, with a partner, committed a series of convenience-store holdups over several years. In spring of 1966, he was arrested for sticking up a cab driver, convicted, and sentenced to five years to life. He spent four-and-a- half years in Chino and Soledad prisons. (In a bit of irony, he worked as a cab driver while putting himself through law school.) During his three-and-a- half years in Soledad, a black counselor introduced Duren to the writings of the African American historian and sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois ‚Äì especially The World and Africa. Even before his slide into criminality, Duren had been a voracious reader. He thus began an intensive study of African‚ÄìAmerican history while in prison, reading books such as The Autobiography of Malcolm X. He also devoured works by writers such as J. A. Rogers, Erich Fromm, Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx, and Vladimir Lenin. He ordered these books through the California State Library and the U.N‚Äôs UNESCO library. One particular area that he devoted himself to was the history of slavery and its effects on, and reverberations in, contemporary life. In addition to his autodidact pursuits, Duren enrolled in and completed classes in economics, sociology, and psychology, as well as astronomy, at San Francisco State University. He was paroled in September 1970 at the age of 27. The Intercommunal Youth Institute Duren, his younger sister, Betty Scott (aka Betty Scott-Smith), and other community activists founded the non-profit Intercommunal Youth Institute (IYI) in Long Beach during the summer of 1973. This alternative school, a project of the Experimental Educational Institute, Inc., was organized by Duren and was modeled after the highly successful Black Panther Party community school in Oakland, California. Duren was the Institute Director and taught world history. Betty Scott was the business manager. The IYI received a certification from the state board of education and also received Title I [federal] funds. The IYI's motto, ‚ÄúThe World is a Classroom,‚Äù captured the school's methodology. As well as giving instruction in the ‚Äúthree Rs‚Äù, the IYI strove to teach its students self-awareness strategies to avoid gangs, drugs, and the criminal life. In the summer of 1975, the Venceremos BrigadeThe Venceremos Brigade is a coalition of young people that was formed in 1969 as a means of showing solidarity with the Cuban Revolution by working side by side with Cuban workers and challenging U.S. policies towards Cuba, including the economic blockade and the U.S.‚Äôs government‚Äôs ban on travel to the island. The first Brigades participated in sugar harvests and subsequent Brigades have done agricultural and construction work in many parts of the island. The Venceremos Brigade is the oldest Cuba solidarity organization in the world. More at venceremosbrigade.net/. chose him to lead a delegation of youth to an international youth summer camp in Cuba to meet with and to discuss youth issues with other students, and to learn about the Cuban Revolution. Upon Duren's return to the U.S., the FBI and INS detained him. He was released after a lengthy interrogation about his purpose for visiting Cuba. Death of Betty Scott On September 20, 1975, while on her way to the Monterey Jazz Festival, Betty Scott and her partner, George Smith, were pulled over at 4 a.m. in Pleasanton, California, near Oakland, reportedly for a speeding violation. Ms. Scott was driving. During the stop, two California Highway Patrol officers, Curtis Engberson and Gordon Robbins, approached the car. Engberson was young, a recent recruit to the CHP. He approached Ms. Scott on the driver's side of the vehicle; Robbins took the passenger's side. There is a conflicted claim as to whether the officers had their guns drawn, which would not be routine in a traffic stop. Other details of the subsequent events are disputed as well. What is on record is that Scott was shot once in the neck by Engberson, fell into Smith's lap, and died almost instantly. The shooting was probably without malice ‚Äì though Engberson and Robbins could still have been held responsible ‚Äì and occurred as a reaction by the young, nervous officer to Robbins's shout, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a gun!‚Äù Smith did keep a gun in the glove compartment, and Ms. Scott had been reaching into the compartment to produce the car's registration in response to Engberson's order to do so. However, powder burns on the victim's neck, the trajectory of the bullet, other physical evidence, and Smith's account strongly suggested that the police testimony was, in crucial details, a fabrication after the fact in order to diminish culpability. An Alameda County grand jury did exonerate the officers (returning a verdict of justifiable homicide), thereby concurring with the police report that Ms. Scott had pointed the gun at the officer and yet this pistol had somehow managed to fall back into the glove compartment after the officer shot her. Smith, who had been in the front seat beside Scott, was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, although he did not have a gun in his possession and was in shock due to Scott's shooting. Charges against him were later dropped after a series of demonstrations organized by the Scott-Smith Defense Committee. Off-the-record testimony by another CHP officer to a member of the Duren family stated that the officer who killed Scott subsequently suffered emotional trauma as a result of his action.Duren, 1985, p. 18. Betty Scott‚Äôs killing was first reported in the Sunday edition of the Oakland Tribune, September 21, 1975, under the sensationalized, all-caps headline: ‚ÄúWOMAN SPEEDER SLAIN ‚Äì PULLED GUN ON COP.‚Äù Subsequent reports of the incident in the Los Angeles Free Press (December 2‚Äì9, 1975) and The Black Panther newspaper (December 27, 1975 and January 31, 1976) shifted the balance of the story to questionable police behavior and evidence in the case, and the demand by the Duren family for a public probe into the events of Scott‚Äôs untimely death. Duren and his family, including Duren's first wife, Virginia Harris, and Mary Blackburn formed the Scott-Smith Committee for Justice to investigate the incident and then sued the CHP for three million dollars in a wrongful death suit. The suit was unsuccessful. Following Scott's death, the IYI dissolved. In February 1976, Duren helped create ‚Äì along with former Black Panthers Michael Zinzun and Anthony Thigpenn ‚Äì the Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA). Duren became its co-chair. The Coalition, notable for its broad-based alliance between the black and Mexican communities in L.A., had as its purpose to prevent, expose, and resist abuse and misconduct by police, and to seek legal redress for such abuse. Duren has been involved in police abuse and brutality issues ever since the formation of The Scott-Smith Committee for Justice and CAPA.  Citizens Against Police Abuse In 1981, Kwaku was a founding member and co-chair of the Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA), a multi-racial community-based organization with activists in East and Southcentral Los Angeles. He later became a lead plaintiff in the ACLU's domestic spying lawsuit against Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates which sought to eliminate the LAPD's Public Disorder and Intelligence Division (PDID). CAPA, et al. vs. Gates, et al., was settled for $1.3 million and the disbanding of the Public Disorder and Intelligence Division (PDID) and the establishing of the LAPD's Anti-Terrorist Division (ATD). Black Panther In the summer of 1976, Duren first enrolled in the Peoples College of Law in Los Angeles. Concurrently, he and some other black activists formed a political study group. He and these activists went to Oakland and met with Elaine Brown, Chairwoman of the Black Panther Party, to discuss reforming the Party in L.A. In October, nearly a year after his sister's killing, and after meeting with members of the Central Committee of the Party, Duren officially joined the Black Panther Party. In January 1977, while LAPD helicopters circled overhead, Duren inaugurated the new office of the Southern California Chapter of the Black Panther Party (SCC/BPP) on Central Avenue in South Central. He believed that the Party had the potential for raising the consciousness of black youth and others in the continuing struggle for ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs power.‚Äù In the summer of the same year, Huey Newton, who had co-founded the Party in 1966 with Bobby Seale, returned from political exile in Cuba. Late in 1977 Elaine Brown quit the BPP as the result of a conflict with Newton, whose behavior had become increasingly erratic, perhaps due to a power struggle exacerbated by Newton's cocaine use. Nonetheless, Duren continued to work with the Party, reorganizing the Southern California Chapter, growing its membership, and carrying out its community involvement agenda. However, his strong stand against the use and trafficking of cocaine by Party members apparently put him in conflict with Newton and other members of the BPP leadership. The re-established SCC under Duren's Coordinator status was always small in member numbers. Duren kept it this way because he felt that many prospective applicants were drawn to the Party more for its public and symbolic role rather than for the serious political agenda that the BPP promulgated. Still, the chapter thrived organizing its ‚Äúsurvival programs.‚Äù These included martial arts training for youth and adults, a Tutorial/Liberation School Program for youth, and a Seniors Against a Fearful Environment (SAFE) escort program. David Bryant, an African American, who was an LAPD officer under orders of the then Police Chief, Daryl Gates, illegally infiltrated the SCC. This ‚Äúdomestic spying case‚Äù became part of the larger civil rights lawsuit, entitled CAPA vs. Gatesagainst the LAPD, and was settled in 1983. In early 1982 the Oakland BBP leadership decided to disband the BPP, and the leadership of the re-organized SCC, collectively, decided to cease operations.CAPA vs, Gates, et al. lawsuit. from A People‚Äôs Lawyer Duren began taking law classes at the Peoples College of Law (PCL) in August 1976. He dropped out about six months into the program and devoted himself to organizing around police abuse/misconduct issues, resulting in the formation of CAPA, as mentioned above, and the reopening of the SCC/BPP in 1977. In late 1979, he was hired as a Community Outreach Worker by Linda Ferguson, Director of the Watts Legal Aid Office (located at Manchester and Broadway in South Central). When a Legal Assistant opening became available about a year later, he was moved into that position; simultaneously, he took paralegal classes at the University of Southern California's Paralegal Program and received a Certificate of Completion. Around 1981, Duren started an independent law study program with Linda Ferguson. However, his involvement with CAPA v. Gates split his focus, so he withdrew from the study program. He returned to the formal study of law by re-enrolling in the PCL in 1985. He graduated in June 1989, received his JD degree, and took the bar for the first time in October 1989. He received confirmation that he had passed in November 1989. The California Committee of Bar Examiners delayed his admission to the state bar as the Subcommittee on Moral Fitness put his attorney application on hold. Duren wrote the State Bar's Governing Board and threatened to sue. He was then admitted and continued to work for legal aid, but as a staff attorney. Duren was sworn in by Judge Richard Paez ‚Äì at the time a superior court judge who had been a former executive director of Legal Aid ‚Äì in Paez‚Äô courtroom in 1990. Paez was later appointed as a federal judge. Duren left Legal Aid for private practice in 1991 due to political pressure from the National Legal Services Corporation in the form of heightened scrutiny of his several campaigns for political office (including running for Congress in 1982 and 1986). There was at the time, and still is, a Congressional prohibition of attorneys employed with Legal Aid running for political office (the legislation that proscribes Legal Aid attorneys running for political office was sponsored by the Republican senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch). In 1993, Duren was certified to practice law in Federal Court and in 1998 certified to practice in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He was appointed to the Superior Court Arbitration/Mediation Panel in 1997 and to the Federal Court's Settlement Officer Panel and Pilot Prisoner Mediation Program in 2000. New Panther Vanguard Movement In 1994 Duran was a founding member and chairman of the New African American Vanguard Movement, which later became the New Panther Vanguard Movement. The organisation was mainly an attempted recreation of the original Black Panther Party but as a response to the heightened racial tensions of the early 1990s being felt in America. Disbarment B. KWAKU DUREN [#147789], 70, of Compton was suspended for two years, stayed, and placed on two years of probation with an actual 30-day suspension and was ordered to take the MPRE and to pay restitution. The order took effect May 10, 2013. (http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/147789) Duren stipulated that he failed to perform legal services with competence by not showing up at a hearing which led to his client's foreclosure case being dismissed. Duren also did not inform the client of significant developments in her case, failed to promptly refund $10,000 in unearned fees and failed to give her a proper accounting when she asked for a refund. He later, belatedly, returned $2,000 of the fees. In mitigation, Duren had more than 20 years of discipline-free practice prior to the misconduct, has been involved in numerous pro bono activities and cooperated with the State Bar by entering into a stipulation before trial. As part of the stipulation, Duren was ordered to pay $8,000, plus interest, to the former client. On March 12, 2017, the Supreme Court of California disbarred Duren after he failed to participate in State Bar Court proceedings related to three counts of misconduct involving a single client matter, which led the State Bar Court to enter his default. The default meant that the court deemed admitted the factual allegations against Duren. ReferencesBibliography * DeSantis, John. The New Untouchables.

It was built by the Works Progress Administration and opened in 1936. History Clermont County was established in 1804 under an enabling act passed by the Ohio General Assembly. The county seat was located at Williamsburg and construction of a courthouse began soon after. The cost of the courthouse was $1,499 and was designed by Nicholas Sinks. The two story stone structure was rectangular and was located in the public square. The courthouse remained in use until 1823. When Brown County was established in 1817, a large chunk of Clermont County went with it. During this time the General Assembly moved the county seat to New Richmond despite protests from Williamsburg. A site was planned and set aside for the courthouse in New Richmond but nothing was ever built. The General Assembly convened again and changed the county seat to Batavia on February 24, 1824. The Commissioners held a contest for the design of the courthouse and chose the plans from Ezekiel Dimmit for $3,484. The courthouse was designed in a combination of the Federal and Greek Revival styles. The building was rectangular in shape and contained a central projection containing a clock and capped by a cupola. The courthouse remained in service for nearly 108 years, until the county decided a larger courthouse was needed. Unfortunately for the county, an elaborate replacement was not feasible, due to the Great Depression. Exterior Milford. The Clermont County Bicentennial Bell hangs in front of courthouse, commemorating the Ohio Bicentennial in 2003. The current courthouse was designed by the architectural firm of Hunt & Allan in the Neoclassical style for $100,000. The building has a rectangular footprint and is three stories high. The facade of the building is lined with red brick and limestone trimwork. The building's main entrance is accessed by a flight of stairs and is framed by four large Tuscan piers supporting an entablature above. A window is located to each side of the central door with a window directly in line on the second floor. The wings to either side of the entrance projection contains three windows on each floor. The flat roof is hidden behind a solid balustrade. An addition behind the old courthouse was finished in 1998. The design was approved by the commissioners and was submitted by Steinkamp, Steinkamp & Hampton. The building was designed in Greek Revival style and contains a central pediment supported by Tuscan columns with brick bases. The pediment contains an elliptical window. A drum rises from the roofline and is topped by a clock tower capped by a dome.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is a Marine with the G.I. Joe Team and debuted in 1986. Profile His real name is Wendell A. Metzger, and his rank is that of gunnery sergeant (E-7). Leatherneck was born in Stromsburg, Nebraska. Leatherneck's primary military specialty is infantry, and his secondary military specialty is drill instructor. Before joining the G.I. Joe Team, Leatherneck was a corporal in Gitmo, a tech sergeant in the 1st Recon Bn in Vietnam, a drill instructor on Parris Island, and a gunny at Camp Lejeune. He earned a reputation for toughness in all of these places, and while he may not come off as likable, he has proven himself trustworthy. As a drill instructor, Leatherneck assumes the role of an enemy when training Joes, turning himself into an insurmountable obstacle. He's proof that you don't need to like your fellow soldiers in order to fight beside them. Leatherneck is ill tempered, obnoxious, and holds irrational grudges against those who don't fit his definition of \\"worthy\\". The only teammate he seems to connect with is Wet Suit, and according to rumor, the two can't stand each other. Their rivalry stems from the tradition of competition between the Navy and the Marine Corps, but their constant bickering conceals a shared respect. Toys Leatherneck was first released as an action figure in 1986. A new version of Leatherneck was released in 1993 as part of the Battle Corps line. Comics In the Marvel comics G.I. Joe series, he first appeared in issue #49. He is a featured supporting character in the next issue, as the focus of an assault team going through the Cobra held-town of Springfield. His squad battles holding-forces led by the newly created Serpentor.G.I.

Joe: A Real American Hero\\" Vol2 #24 Animated series=Sunbow He first appeared in the Sunbow/Marvel G.I. Joe second-season episode \\"Arise, Serpentor, Arise!: Part I\\". He was often arguing with fellow Joe Wet-Suit (who was a Navy Seal). He was known for being uncouth loud and hot headed. Leatherneck was voiced by Chuck McCann. Leatherneck played a part in the episode \\"Let's Play Soldier,\\" where he has an encounter with street orphans in an Asian town, at the same time that Doctor Mindbender and the Dreadnoks are harvesting a special sap, which causes anyone who comes in contact with it to act like mindless zombies. Doctor Mindbender tries twice to offer Leatherneck a piece of gum, which contained the sap as one of the ingredients. Once Doctor Mindbender's plot is thwarted, Leatherneck is able to get the local innkeeper to take the street orphans in as fellow workers much to the objection of the other Joes (who wanted the street orphans to end up in American foster care). In the episode \\"The Rotten Egg,\\" it is shown in flashbacks that Leatherneck worked at the CEC Military Academy, where he had problems with a tough cadet named Buck McCann. For instance, when the drill instructor witnessed him injuring a fellow cadet with sadistic glee, Leatherneck immediately punished him by withdrawing his recommendation for him for Officer Candidate School. One night, Leatherneck caught Buck and two men smuggling weapons, but was knocked out during the conflict. Some years later, Leatherneck returns to the military academy only to discover that Buck has taken over the CEC Military Academy (renaming its acronym to Cobra Elite Corps) and has allied himself with Serpentor with Buck being served by cadets Mike P. Randall and Sheila McDermott. Leatherneck is trapped following a hunt on him (where he was knocked out by Sheila McDermott despite rescuing her from the river) and Buck leads the cadets to attack the Parris Island Military Academy. Leatherneck escapes and manages to borrow one of the Dreadnoks' motorcycles. Upon claiming an outfit from one of Buck McCann's soldiers, Leatherneck helps the Joes fight the soldiers which ends with Leatherneck defeating Buck McCann. Buck and his soldiers are then arrested by G.I. Joe with Mike P. Randall ripping off the CEC patch from his shoulder and Sheila McDermott still claiming that Cobra will be victorious. Leatherneck was featured in a PSA where he explains to two girls the horrors of not applying suntan lotion when at the beach. G.I. Joe: The Movie Leatherneck also appeared briefly in the 1987 animated film G.I. Joe: The Movie. Other works Leatherneck's figure is briefly featured in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures to set up a battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. As he imagined the characters in his head, he described four of the Joes on front lines of the battle: Hawk, Leatherneck, Wet Suit, and Sci-Fi \\"stood in procession, weapons raised, adrenaline pumping feverishly. Anxious for another victory over the dreaded Cobra.\\" He described how Leatherneck, \\"always the traditional soldier, stood just behind Hawk, his gray rifle at his side\\".

The English language libretto by Richard Henry Hart is based on August Strindberg's 1889 play of the same name. It premiered at the White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut on August 9, 1952 and was dedicated to that theatre's founder, the actress Lucille Lortel. About the opera The Stronger is an approximately 25 minute staged duodrama that is in many respects a monologue with one singing role, Estelle (coloratura soprano), and one silent role, Lisa. The opera takes place at a bar on Christmas Eve. The two women meet at the establishment and Estelle talks to her friend Lisa about her family. In the course of the conversation Estelle informs Lisa that she knows that Lisa is in love with her husband Harold. As Estelle leaves the bar she comes to the conclusion that she, Estelle, is the stronger of the two women. The Stronger at usopera.com But is she? Weisgall said of the opera: > \\"From the first I regarded this piece as an experiment, a kind of operatic > exercise. My primary task was to find ways to translate Strindberg‚Äôs > psychological monodrama, with its rapid, constantly changing moods and its > almost total lack of sustained moments, into musical terms. The chief > problem was that the music had to function alternately as background and > foreground‚Äîat times pure atmosphere, then shifting between characterizing > the protagonist, Estelle, and picturing the physical movements of the > wordless Lisa. Also I sought somehow to balance the two roles more equally. > Rather than conform to the traditional theatrical interpretation in which > ‚Äúthe star‚Äù plays the silent role and comes out on top, I tried to leave open > the question as to which of the two women is really ‚Äúthe stronger.\\"Hugo > Weisgall on The Stronger, 1971 Performance history and recordings The Stronger was first performed at the White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut for four performances in August 1952 by the Hilltop Opera Company of Baltimore, Maryland. The production used piano accompaniment and soprano Eva Bober portrayed Estelle for three of the four performances. Weisgall had composed the work specifically for the group during the spring and summer prior to its premiere. The first performance of the work with an orchestra (scaled for only 8 musicians) was given at the Composers Forum at Columbia University in New York City, New York in January 1955 with soprano Adelaide Bishop and the Columbia Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Siegfried Landau. That 1955 performance was recorded and another recording of the opera was made with soprano Johanna Meier and the Aeolian Chamber Players on the New World Records label in 1972. Bishop also sang the role for the opera's New York City premiere in 1950 and directed the opera for a 1995 production starring soprano Darynn Zimmer at the White Barn Theatre. The Baltimore Opera Company staged the work in 1985 in a triple bill titled \\"American Portraits\\" that also included Thomas Pasatieri's La Divina (1952) and the world premiere of Lee Hoiby's Italian Lesson. Initially Weisgall had intended for The Stronger to be a work that could be performed as a pair with his opera The Tenor (1952). However, years later he determined that it would fit better as part of a trilogy with two other operas he composed: Purgatory (1958) and Will You Marry Me? (1989). The Stronger and Weisgall's The Golden Peacock were performed at the occasion of the latter work's premiere by the Opera Ensemble of New York with Cecelia Wasson as Estelle.
