Most large print rooms have an example of this print A print room is either a room or industrial building where printing takes place, or a room in an art gallery or museum, where a collection of old master and modern prints, usually together with drawings, watercolours, and photographs, are held and viewed. The latter meaning is the subject of this article. A further meaning is a room decorated by pasting prints onto the wall in a quasi-collage style to form a sort of wallpaper, an 18th-century fashion, of which several examples survive. One of the largest, though atypically the prints are cut out round shapes, that are pasted well spaced apart, is at The Vyne, Basingstoke, Hampshire. Appearance For conservation reasons, works on paper cannot be permanently displayed, as light, temperature, and humidity conditions leave them vulnerable to damage, normally limiting an open display to no more than 6 months. They are kept in inert, acid-free boxes, albums, or portfolios behind closed doors; which considerations of space would dictate in any case for the vast majority. Where possible, they are mounted on archivally safe supports, but large collections still contain less important items loose inboxes. Storage may be in the same room as the viewing is done (the 'Reading-' or 'Study Room'), but as the largest collections have well over a million items stores are often located 'behind the scenes', along with the curators' offices. Typically, a large print room appears like a library reading room, and the visitor sits at a desk equipped with a stand or easel, fills in a request slip, and the material requested is brought out for them by curatorial staff, who are able to offer further information about works and artists. Visitors are often able to compare a selection of works by different artists, aiding connoisseurial study.  Visiting Drawing of martyrs John and Paul by Guercino, Courtauld Institute, London Most national collections can be seen by the public more easily than is often realised. Usually, visitors of all sorts, whether researchers or not, are entitled to view works on paper not on display in the galleries, which will form the great majority of an institution's collection, thereby making print rooms an essential resource for enabling our understanding and appreciation of works on paper ‚Äì in particular, how artists conceive of finished paintings through preparatory studies, and how printmaking traditions and techniques have evolved over the centuries. On a national level, print rooms tend to differ, each having their own specialism, though collections often overlap in content. There are links to lists of print rooms at the end of this article; most lead to the gallery's or museum's web-pages, which explain visiting arrangements. In many cases, appointments need to be made in advance, and proof of identity should usually be provided. While it is helpful to outline what you would like to see (including artists' names and catalogue numbers, which may be available online or in books), visitors are also usually welcome to discuss their needs more casually by phoning or emailing in advance of their appointment. It is important to remember that not all material will be available to view, depending on current loans and exhibitions commitments and the condition of works. Some especially fragile or valuable items may not normally be available for viewing. Within the print room setting rules and regulations will vary from institution to institution. Some print rooms may allow visitors to photograph works (without a flash), while others may permit sketching. The V&A;'s Prints and Drawings Study Room allows photography but Tate Britain's Prints and Drawings Rooms do not, though Tate visitors are allowed to sketch and paint in watercolour with appropriate precautions. Print Rooms need not be 'passive' spaces ‚Äì though they are places for study (perhaps suggestive of quiet contemplation), they are also geared towards fostering creative engagement in diverse audiences. Several internationally renowned print rooms lead or contribute to, a range of public educational programmes, including talks, tours, and study days for groups. In particular, university print rooms, including those of the Yale University Art Gallery, are regularly set aside for art-historical lectures.  Often not in the expected museum  Ukiyo-e coloured woodcut by Hokusai Because of the historical development of museums, and also funding, prints, and drawings are sometimes associated with library collections rather than collections of paintings. For example, in Paris, the main print (but not drawings) collection is in the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, not the Louvre. In New York and Washington, both the main art museums (Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Gallery of Art Washington) and the libraries (New York Public Library and Library of Congress) all have important, though very different, collections. Sometimes, material from non-Western traditions ‚Äì in particular, Asian material, including Japanese prints ‚Äì may or may not be held in the same department, or the same institution. In the US public libraries are officially more accessible than art museum print rooms, which are often privately funded and only open to academic researchers. But most public libraries with prints and drawings collections tend to house these in discrete rooms, where they are tended to by specialist works on paper curators (see, for example, the Art and Architecture Room and Prints and Photographs Room of New York Public Library). In the UK national collections of art on paper are, in the main, publicly funded and thus widely accessible in gallery and museum print rooms; they rarely form part of library holdings. The UK's main collection of Western prints and drawings is held in the British Museum and includes fine examples by the Old Masters. The National Gallery holds no works on paper; only paintings and sculptures of the European tradition. Originally known as the national gallery of British art, Tate Britain holds British prints and drawings, which include the world's largest collection of watercolours, sketches and engravings by JMW Turner, historic works on paper from the late 18th and 19th centuries, and modern and contemporary British and International prints. The Victoria and Albert Museum's works on the paper collection have a particularly broad remit, encompassing works of fine and applied art (including posters) as well as ephemera. When the British Museum's main collection and library collection separated in 1997, evinced by the establishment of the British Library (on separate premises in St Pancras), art on paper remained within the British Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings, with, for example, the exception of the library's East India Company collection which largely comprises maps and topographical drawings, now held within the Asia, Pacific and Africa Department of the British Library. Because of a decision in the late 19th century, where the bulk of the collection of topographical prints was classed with maps and put under the British Museum Library rather than the Prints and Drawings Department, these are now also in the British Library. The decision reflected the traditional view going back to the Renaissance that fine art required the use of the imagination, and that mere illustration of real scenes (often in practice considerably rearranged by the artist) did not qualify. When, conversely, the Victoria and Albert Museum united its art and library collections, with the establishment of the Word and Image division, the Prints and Drawings Study Rooms and the National Art Library remained discrete entities, each with their own specialist staff (with different areas of academic and professional training) and facilities and services catered to the public's and collections' needs. One of the relatively few print rooms to exist as a separate institution (rather than as part of a larger museum or library), the Albertina (Vienna) is by general consent the world's greatest collection of Western art on paper. The Berlin Kupferstichkabinett at Kulturforum is, similarly, a major museum with an exclusive focus on prints and drawings. Though housed in the same building as the main paintings collection, the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, it has separate direction and administration. (The list of museums with major collections of European prints and drawings has some very incomplete figures on the holdings of major collections.)

Life Schoeck, born in Graz, spent his early years in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, finishing high school in Ludwigsburg. He then studied medicine, philosophy and psychology at the universities of Munich and T√ºbingen. With a dissertation on Karl Mannheim, Schoeck would obtain his doctorate under Eduard Spranger. For fifteen years, starting in 1950, Schoeck would work as a professor at various U.S. universities. In 1953, he taught philosophy at Fairmont State College, followed by a two-year stint at Yale. At Emory University he was awarded a full professorship in sociology. During the 1950s, Schoeck published some works in German, and translated Joachim Wach's Sociology of Religion into German. In 1965, Schoeck returned to Germany, where he obtained a chair in sociology at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, which he would occupy until his retirement in 1990. Schoeck, who was also a columnist of the Welt am Sonntag for twenty years, died of cancer in 1993. Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior Schoeck gained international fame with his book Der Neid: Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft (Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior), published in 1966, with the first English translation appearing in 1969. Written without much technical jargon, the book would receive widespread appreciation, even outside the academic community. The book became somewhat of a bestseller, and was translated into more than ten languages. Paul Dumouchel said in the book Schoeck speaks about \\"the origin of envy,...its cause and function within society\\" and also \\"documents the importance of envy in literature, philosophy, and in many social sciences\\". He went on to say that Shoeck puts forward two propositions - first, that envy has played a large part in forming human society, and that, secondly, the role of envy often remains hidden. Shoeck also argued that as envy was a natural part of human evolution and could not be suppressed, it was important to channel the emotion. He also suggested that socialism and democracy were put forward as ideas by members of society who were not able \\"to deal with their own envy\\", and Karl Marx's idea of communism was \\"entirely mistaken\\". A polemicist against the New Left movements of the 1960s, Schoeck criticized their ideas from a conservative-liberal viewpoint. The egalitarian and anticapitalist mentality of the leftish generation was the particular target of Schoeck's ire.

It ran from 1886 until 1955 and was sometimes known as the New Plymouth Mail due to the Railway Travelling Post Office carriages included in its consist. The Express was notable amongst NZR's provincial expresses as being both the first and, until the commencement of the Gisborne Express in 1942, the longest in distance travelled.  Introduction  On 23 March 1885, NZR opened the railway line between Palmerston North and New Plymouth, with a short branch from Aramoho to Wanganui. A year and a half later, on 3 November 1886, the privately owned Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company opened from Wellington to Longburn, a small village just south of Palmerston North, where it interchanged with NZR. This allowed a direct train to be run between Wellington and New Plymouth; this also formed part of a newer, quicker route to Auckland through connections with steamers between New Plymouth and Auckland's Onehunga Wharf.  Operation  The earliest incarnation of the Express took 14 hours 50 minutes to complete its journey, with a change of trains at Longburn. It began operating from the start of December 1886 and ran twice weekly. Its northbound run left the WMR's Thorndon station in Wellington at 7am on Tuesdays and Fridays, with NZR's southbound service departing New Plymouth at the same time; the two trains met at Longburn, where passengers had to change. The WMR introduced dining cars not long after it began operating, but NZR trains made refreshment stops at Halcombe and Patea. In 1901, NZR and the WMR co-operated to accelerate the train by eliminating the change of trains at Longburn. By this stage, the train ran every day except Sunday, and on four days a week NZR's train ran all the way through to Wellington, while on the other two days the WMR's train ran to New Plymouth. This cut the travelling time down to 12 hours and 50 minutes, and in 1902, NZR eliminated refreshment stops by introducing dining cars of its own. The Express was the second train in New Zealand to be equipped with dining cars, after the South Express, and thus the first in the North Island. On 7 December 1908 the WMR was acquired by NZR, although the already established practice of through running meant this acquisition had little effect on the Express, except for some changes to the Railway Travelling Post Office and the north- and southbound trains crossing at Marton rather than Longburn. A more dramatic change for the Express was the 1908 opening of the North Island Main Trunk Railway, providing a more direct and quicker route between Wellington and Auckland than the combination of the Express and the steamship to Onehunga. Another change was forced on the train in 1917 by restrictions due to World War I: refreshment stops were re-introduced when the dining cars were withdrawn, never to return. In 1925, AB class steam locomotives were allocated to the Express, allowing its journey time to be reduced from 12 hours to 9 hours 38 minutes. Although the Express had always been augmented by slower mixed trains, the Taranaki Flyer was introduced in 1926 as an alternative service between Wanganui and New Plymouth, and in April 1938 the RM class Standard railcars began operating an evening service between Wellington and New Plymouth. The railcars eventually took over from the Express, but not for almost two decades. During the 1930s, the Great Depression impacted the Expresss loadings, reducing it from nine or ten carriages to only six, but as the economy improved it expanded to eight or nine carriages by the start of World War II, equipped with the most modern carriages. During the War, the Express's carriages were dispersed and it ran with a wide variety of rolling stock; this situation was not rectified until it was re-equipped in 1948. The Turakina Deviation on the Marton - New Plymouth Line opened in 1947, allowing the journey time to be reduced to 9.25 hours. = Motive power = The WMR typically operated the New Plymouth Express with its premier locomotives: Nos. 16 and 17 hauled the train over the hilly section between Wellington and Paekakariki, sometimes banked by No. 3 \\"Jumbo\\". From Paekakariki to Longburn, Nos. 19 and 20 took the train across the plains of the Kapiti Coast and Horowhenua. After the WMR was acquired by NZR, Nos. 19 and 20, now classified as UD class, worked the train through to Marton for a few years before being replaced by A class locomotives. Tank locomotives were the primary motive power on the Marton - New Plymouth Line for many years. These included E, M, WA, WB, WD, WF, and WW classes at various times between 1886 and 1925, plus BB class tender locomotives. 1925 saw AB class tender engines used throughout, and in the late 1930s the K and KA classes were phased in, followed by the JA class after WWII. The final regular steam-hauled Express was hauled by JA 1289\\\\. = The Ferry = The Ferry was a short twice-daily passenger service between Wanganui and Aramoho on the main line, where the Express stopped. During the era of the AB class working the Express locomotives were changed at Aramoho, and The Ferry was closely tied to this procedure. The first Ferry of the day from Wanganui met the southbound Express to Wellington at Aramoho. The Ferrys AB and any carriages from Wanganui for Wellington were attached to the Express, and the Express's AB and any New Plymouth carriages for Wanganui were detached. The Express continued south, while its original engine hauled The Ferry back to Wanganui. This engine and The Ferry returned to Aramoho to meet the northbound Express to New Plymouth, where the engine and any Wanganui carriages for New Plymouth were attached to the Express after the Expresss AB and any Wellington carriages for Wanganui were detached. The Express then continued to New Plymouth, headed by the engine that had hauled the southbound Express to Aramoho and the Ferry to Wanganui and back, while the engine from Wellington took the final Ferry of the day to Wanganui. When the K and KA locomotives were introduced, The Ferry was retained. However, in later years the locomotive change took place in Palmerston North, with the same locomotive running the train between New Plymouth and Palmerston North. This eliminated the locomotive workings around which The Ferry was based, and it was replaced with a bus service.  Replacement  The demise of the Express came in 1955. That year the 88-seater railcars were introduced, allowing redeployed Standard railcars to replace the Express. This took effect on 31 October 1955, with the journey accelerated to 7.25 hours. As the 88-seater fleet expanded, they joined the Standards on the Wellington-New Plymouth run and operated it until 17 December 1972. In 1968 three 88-seaters were extensively refurbished and renamed \\"Blue Streaks\\" because of their distinctive paint scheme, and in 1972 they were allocated to the Wellington-New Plymouth service. The Blue Streaks operated the Express's former run while unrefurbished 88-seaters continued on the evening service, which was reduced to running on Fridays and Sundays. The evening service was soon withdrawn, and the Blue Streaks were cancelled on 30 July 1977.

It was described mainly by Karl Kautsky. Post-imperialism is sometimes used as a synonym of ultra-imperialism, although it can have distinct meanings.  Origin of the term  The suggestion of a possible ultra-imperialism is normally attributed to Karl Kautsky, the leading theoretician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the era of the Kaiserreich. Kautsky coined the term in 1914, but he had speculated on the issue several times in 1912 already. He postulated that in the field of international relations a \\"stage [approaches], in which the competition among states will be disabled by their cartel relationship\\".Karl Kautsky, Der erste Mai und der Kampf gegen den Militarismus, Neue Zeit 30 (1912), Vol. 2, p. 107-108 (translated from German). Thus, Kautsky‚Äôs ultra-imperialism concept was shaped by the idea of cartels made up by states for the purpose of international policy. However, the basic idea of a possible pacification of imperialism did not really originate from Kautsky. The British left-liberal John Atkinson Hobson had written in 1902 in a similar context about a potential inter-imperialism which could be established by a combination of great powers (combination or combine then being used to designate cartels).John A. Hobson: Imperialism, London 1902, 311. In 1907, Karl Liebknecht stated in his brochure Militarismus und Antimilitarismus that \\"a trustification of all actual and potential colonies among the colonial powers, so to speak, [‚Ä¶] a disabling of the colonial rivalry among the states [could take place in the future], as it occurred to some extent for the private competition among capitalist entrepreneurs in the cartels and trusts\\".Karl Liebknecht: Schriften. Vol. 1., Berlin 1958, p. 269-270 (translated from German). On the eve of World War I, these peace-loving social-democrats and liberals in Europe hoped that the great powers‚Äîbeginning with the British Empire and the German Reich‚Äîwould unite into a states' cartel or a combination of states giving the rivals organization and reconciliation.Holm A.

Karl Kautsky's statements in 1914  In 1914, Kautsky published an article on imperialism which subsequently was translated into English and published in the United States. In these, he argued there could be a way out of direful wars among the imperialist powers, a solution now named ultra-imperialism or super-imperialism.Karl Kautsky, Der Imperialismus, in: Die Neue Zeit. 32 (1914), Vol. 2, p. 908‚Äì922; Karl Kautsky: Imperialism and the War, in: International socialist review, 15 (1914). Kautsky elucidated this thought in the September 1914 issue of Die Neue Zeit. He described the current phase of capitalism as imperialism. In Marxist theory, imperialism consists of capitalist states superexploiting labour in agrarian regions in order to increase both the imperialist nation's productivity and their market. However, imperialism also required capitalist states to introduce protectionist measures and to defend their empires militarily. He believed that this was the ultimate cause of World War I.Karl Kautsky, Ultra-imperialism. Kautsky noted that before the war while industrial accumulation had continued, exports had dropped as a result of a tendency of industry to expand out of proportion to agriculture. He pointed out that growing nationalism in the more industrially advanced colonies would necessitate a continuation of the arms race after the war and that should this occur, economic stagnation would worsen. In Kautsky's view, the only one way in which capitalists would be able to maintain the basic system while avoiding this stagnation would be for the wealthiest nations to form a cartel in the same manner as which banks had co-operated, agreeing to limit their competition and renounce their arms race in order to maintain their export markets and their systems of superexploitation. In doing so, he postulated that war and militarism were not essential features of capitalism and that a peaceful capitalism was possible.  Vladimir Lenin's criticism Vladimir Lenin disagreed with Kautsky's approach. In an introduction to Nikolai Bukharin's Imperialism and World Economy written in 1916, he conceded that \\"in the abstract one can think of such a phase. In practice, however, he who denies the sharp tasks of to-day in the name of dreams about soft tasks of the future becomes an opportunist\\".Lenin's introduction to Nikolai Bukharin, Imperialism and the World Economy. Lenin developed Bukharin's theories of imperialism and his own arguments formed the core of his work Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism. He wrote that Kautsky's theory supposed \\"the rule of finance capital lessens the unevenness and contradictions inherent in the world economy, whereas in reality it increases them\\". He gives examples of disparities in the international economy and discusses how they would develop even under a system of ultra-imperialism. He asks under the prevailing system \\"what means other than war could there be under capitalism to overcome the disparity between the development of productive forces and the accumulation of capital on the one side, and the division of colonies and spheres of influence for finance capital on the other?\\"Lenin, Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism.  Recent positions on the idea of ultraimperialism  Some Marxists have pointed out similarities between the co-operation between the capitalist states during the Cold War and ultra-imperialism.Lenin, Kautsky and \\"ultra-imperialism\\", World Socialist Web Site.\\"Ultra-imperialism\\": a debate, Workers Liberty. Martin Thomas of Workers Liberty points out that \\"since the collapse of the Stalinist bloc in 1989-91, that 'ultra-imperialism' has extended to cover almost the whole globe\\". Thomas goes on to say that it is not simply ‚Äúa sharply polarised world of industrial states on one side, agrarian states on the other, with the industrial states joining together to keep the agrarian states un-industrial by force‚Äù. Rather, ‚Äúit is a very unequal but multifarious system, with political independence for the ex-colonies, rapidly-permuting new international divisions of labour, and many poorer states exporting mostly manufactured goods\\".Martin Thomas, Introduction to Kautsky's \\"Ultra- imperialism\\", Workers Liberty. Other commentators have pointed to similarities between Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's theory of empire and Kautsky's theory, although the authors themselves claim their theory is founded in Leninism.Bashir Abu-Manneh, The Illusions of Empire, Monthly Review. Opponents of the theory of ultra-imperialism argue that whatever similar forms may have existed during the Cold War, since its end inter-capitalist competition has tended to increaseJuan Chingo and Gustavo Dunga. Empire or Imperialism?, Fourth International - Trotskyist Fraction. and that the nature of capitalism makes it impossible for capitalists to make conscious decisions to avoid behaviour if in the short term it proves beneficial.  Related theories  State cartel theory, a new concept in the field of international relations theory, uses the basic conception of Kautsky's ultra-imperialism, but it is not a Marxist theory.

It was the first film in which aromas were integral to the story, providing important details to the audience. It was produced by Mike Todd, Jr., who, in conjunction with his father Mike Todd, had produced such spectacles as This Is Cinerama and Around the World in Eighty Days. The film was released in Cinerama under the title Holiday in Spain without Smell-O-Vision. In 2012, the film was restored, reconstructed and re-released by David Strohmaier. In 2015, a version complete with reconstructed scents was presented at screenings in Los Angeles, Denmark and England. Jack Cardiff called it the \\"one film I want to erase from my memory. The reason for this is that, through no fault of my own, the film was a complete disaster.\\" Plot A mystery novelist, played by Denholm Elliott, discovers a plan to murder an American heiress, played by Elizabeth Taylor in an uncredited role, while on vacation in Spain. He enlists the help of a taxi driver, played by Peter Lorre, to travel across the Spanish countryside in order to thwart the crime. Cast * Denholm Elliott as Oliver Larker * Peter Lorre as Smiley * Beverly Bentley as The Decoy Sally Kennedy * Paul Lukas as Baron Saradin * Liam Redmond as Johnny Gin * Leo McKern as Tommy Kennedy * Peter Arne as Robert Fleming * Mary Laura Wood as Margharita * Diana Dors as Winifred Jordan * Judith Furse as Miss Leonard * Maurice Marsac as Pepi * Michael Trubshawe as English Aviator * Juan Olaguivel as Truck Driver * Billie Miller as Constance Walker Ghost of a Chance The screenplay was adapted from the 1947 novel Ghost of a Chance by Kelley Roos, the pen name of husband- and-wife mystery writers Audrey Kelley and William Roos. The novel was set in locations in New York City and was about a husband and wife investigating a possible murder of a woman about whose existence they are unsure. Kelley Roos also wrote a 1959 paperback novelization of the screenplay, reset in Spain. The New York Times wrote that \\"... unlike almost all other film adaptations, it's a highly entertaining book ‚Äì so light and bright and gay in its wild adventure in southern Spain that you never care whether it makes much sense or not.\\" Smell technology According to the Los Angeles Times, in 1954, Mike Todd Sr. was introduced to the Smell-O-Vision process, which enabled certain odors to be released into a theater during a screening. Todd was enthusiastic about the process, which was invented by a Swiss professor named Hans Laube (1900‚Äì76). Laube had demonstrated the concept at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Todd Sr. considered incorporating it into Around the World in Eighty Days but decided against it. When Todd died, his son decided to use Laube's process in a film that would incorporate the sense of smell into the actual storytelling process. For the film's director, Todd Jr. chose Jack Cardiff, a leading cinematographer whom Todd Sr. had wanted to shoot the never-filmed Don Quixote and who had just made his directorial debut with Sons and Lovers. Cardiff later said that \\"... using smells in a film was also an ambition I had had for years.\\" Some scenes were designed to highlight Smell-O-Vision's capabilities. In one, wine casks fall off a wagon and roll down a hill, smashing against a wall, at which point a grape scent was released. Other scenes were accompanied by aromas that revealed key points to the audience. For example, the assassin was identified by the smell of a smoking pipe. =Casting= Cardiff says that he recommended Peter Sellers to play the lead role, but a nervous Sellers made a poor impression on Todd during a lunch meeting. The lead instead went to Denholm Elliott. Production During production, the film was titled The Chase Is On. Filming started April 1959 near Barcelona, and took three months. The film was shot entirely in Spain and involved traveling 100,000 kilometres. It was filmed in color using the Todd- AO process. Locations included Seville's San Tomo Bridge, El Chorro, Granada, C√≥rdoba, Madrid, Barcelona, Pamplona, the Alhambra and M√°laga Cathedral. Filmink argued that Beverly Bentley's role should have been played by Diana Dors, who instead had a cameo. Bentley was a television actress from Atlanta whom Todd had discovered. In May, Peter Lorre suffered a heart attack while filming near Grenada. Cardiff says that a double was then employed for most of Lorre's subsequent scenes. Cardiff has said, \\"Shooting the film was exciting and we were all convinced we had a great movie.\\" However, halfway through filming, he asked Todd if he had actually experienced the Smell-O-Vision effect, but Todd had not, so samples were sent to them by Dr. Laube, the inventor of the process. \\"It's hard to believe but each labelled glass smelled exactly the same as the others‚Äìlike a very cheap eau de cologne,\\" said Cardiff, \\"... it was such a sad thing that the film was made ... as integral part of the film was of course the use of smells, and it didn't come off because the smells were nothing, they were a fake.\\" Todd said, \\"... we want to make a good picture with laughs, entertainment and thrills ‚Äì and we hope it will be received with critical approval. Already our film has been referred to as the original smellodrama and the first picture that smells. But no matter what we call the process we are pioneers, and its got to be good or the boys will take full advantage of the connotation. I hope it is the kind of picture they call a scent-sation.\\" =Scents used in the film= *Pipe tobacco: Smoked by the villain *Coffee *Roses *Wine *Gunpowder *peppermint *Shoe polish * Gasoline *Perfume: The method to identify the girl whose life is in danger *Flowers *Brandy *Fresh sea air *Peaches *Bananas *Wine *Wood shavings Rival film Scent of Mystery was not the only attempt to combine cinema and smell. The AromaRama system, which released scents through the air conditioning system of a theater, was first used for the travelogue Behind the Great Wall in December 1959. Release Costs of the Smell-O-Vision system were high. It took an estimated $25 to $30 per seat to install and use Smell-O-Vision at a time when a movie tickets cost less than $1. Ads for the film proclaimed: \\"First they moved (1895)! Then they talked (1927)! Now they smell!\\" Producer Mike Todd, who was a bit of a showman, engaged in such hyperbole, saying, \\"I hope it's the kind of picture they call a scentsation!\\" He also got help from newspaper columnists such as Earl Wilson, who lauded the system, claiming that Smell-O-Vision \\"can produce anything from skunk to perfume, and remove it instantly.\\" New York Times writer Richard Nason believed that it was a major advance in filmmaking. As such, expectations for the film were great. =Previews= The film opened in three specially equipped theaters in February 1960, in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. However, the mechanism did not work well. According to Variety, aromas were released with a distracting hissing noise, and audience members in the balcony complained that the scents reached them several seconds after the action was shown on the screen. In other parts of the theater, the odors were too faint, causing audience members to sniff loudly in an attempt to catch the scents. Cardiff recalled that the Chicago screening worked well: \\"Exactly on cue you'd get the whiff of the smell coming up from the seat in front of you, so you'd smell it\\", adding that the \\"press and everybody, they all said the same thing: there is no particular smell about anything. It was all a kind of cheap eau de cologne. This was a disaster. And then later on we ran it in New York, and that was the end of that because it had terrible notices because it was not a genuine Smell-O-Vision at all. It was a very interesting story with a marvellous photographic background of Spain, but the smell, for which it was made, didn't exist.\\" The daughter of Smell-O-Vision inventor Hans Laube's later claimed that the technology used at these screenings was different from what her father had envisioned. She wrote, \\"The producers realized they could save a fortune if they air-conditioned the scents in rather than install the elegant, costly little units in front of each theatre seat. Hans's concept was, install the scent emitters in front of a certain number of seats. Send the scent; send some neutralizer. Personalized. Tidy and elegant. (And apparently, costly.) So very late in the game, one of the producers decided they could make much more $ by using the air conditioner to waft in the scents. And, screw the neutralizer. So the film became known as Mike Todd Jr's only Stinker.\\" Technical adjustments by Smell-O-Vision's manufacturers solved these problems, but by then it was too late. Negative reviews, in conjunction with word of mouth, caused the film to fail miserably, with theatrical rentals of only $300,000 in the United States and Canada. Comedian Henny Youngman quipped, \\"I didn't understand the picture. I had a cold.\\" Todd later said that his press agent Bill Doll \\"... had an idea that would have saved the damned thing if we'd thought of it before the film opened. And that was to reverse the pump. It sucked air back, so that there was no overhang on the previous smell. Otherwise it just sort of drifted in between smells. It wasn't over powering, but just enough not to make the clearest delineation. Bill got this idea after the third opening. It was used, and it worked perfectly, but by that time the ship had sailed.\\" =Critical= Variety said that the film \\"... has many elements that are derivative of a Hitchcock chase film, the late Mike Todd's \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\", and the Cinerama travelogue technique ... The travelog is neatly integrated as part of the chase.\\" The New York Times said: > As theatrical exhibitionism, it is gaudy, sprawling and full of sound. But > as an attempt at a considerable motion picture it has to be classified as > bunk... It is an artless, loose-jointed \\"chase\\" picture... Whatever novel > stimulation it might afford with the projection of smells appears to be > dubious and dependent upon the noses of the individual viewers and the > smell-projector's whims... Indistinct is the right word for the whole silly > plot of the film and the casual, confused performance of it, which is > virtually amateur. Except for the job of Peter Lorre... the acting is > downright atrocious. The Los Angeles Times called the film \\"... good family entertainment and while it is doubtful whether the smellies are here to stay you'll find this one worth a look... and smell.\\" =Box office= The film made only $300,000 in North America. Todd later said that he felt that the idea \\"... was just a novelty gimmick. Maybe, if it was a gigantic hit, you might make a second film, and at the most, a third, but that would have been it.\\" Todd did not produce another film until 1979's The Bell Jar, which was also his last film. Holiday in Spain release The film was retitled as Holiday in Spain and re- released, but without the odors, by Cinerama, which needed new product for its specially equipped theaters. The film was converted into three-strip prints that could be exhibited on the very wide, deeply curved screens in the special theaters. However, having been converted from Smell-O-Vision, as The Daily Telegraph described it, \\"... the film acquired a baffling, almost surreal quality, since there was no reason why, for example, a loaf of bread should be lifted from the oven and thrust into the camera for what seemed to be an unconscionably long time.\\" Scent of Mystery was aired once on television by MTV and syndicated on local TV stations in the 1980s. A convenience-store promotion, similar to that for the movie Polyester, offered scratch-and-sniff cards for viewers to recreate the theater experience. Restoration In 2012, Holiday in Spain was completely restored and digitally reconstructed by film editor and Cinerama restoration specialist David Strohmaier. Only portions of the original camera negative remained in usable condition, so the remaining parts of the film were reconstructed from two archival 70-mm Eastmancolor prints. Not enough of the deleted footage from the original Scent of Mystery was recovered to be able to restore that version as well. The newly restored film was released on Blu-ray in 2014 by Screen Archives. In 2015, Australian film producer Tammy Burnstock and artist and scent creator Saskia Wilson-Brown revived the Smell-O-Vision experience, presenting Strohmaier's restored film at screenings in Los Angeles, Denmark and England. The only information about the scents used in the original production was a list with entries such as \\"happy odor of baking bread\\" and \\"the faint smell of a yellow rose.\\" Without any perfumers' or chemists' specifications, Wilson-Brown recreated the film's smells from scratch by blending possible aroma ingredients.

It is considered to be the authoritative treatise in Indian classical music by both the Hindustani music and the Carnatic music traditions. ≈öƒÅr·πÖgadeva was born in a Brahmin family of Kashmir. In an era of Islamic invasion of the northwest regions of the Indian subcontinent and the start of Delhi Sultanate, his family migrated south and settled in the Hindu kingdom in the Deccan region ruled by the Yadava dynasty near Ellora Caves (Maharashtra). Sarangadeva worked as an accountant with freedom to pursue his music interests in the court of King Singhana II (1210‚Äì1247).Ramanlal Chhotalal Mehta, Musical Musings: Selected Essays, Indian Musicological Society (1996), p. 46 Ideas ≈öƒÅr·πÖgadeva presented his ideas on music and dance in seven chapters of Sangita Ratnakara, but integrated it with philosophical context. He systematically presented his ideas on the nature of sound, register, the smallest distinct sounds that humans can hear and musical instruments can produce (shruti), musical scales and modes, 264 ragas, beats and role of time (tala), prosody (Chandas), relation between performance arts and human emotions and sentiments, musical and vocal ornaments, the composition of drama and songs, and the limitless opportunities available to the artist to express and affect her audience. According to Peter Fletcher ‚Äì a professor of Music and Drama, ≈öƒÅr·πÖgadeva states in Sangita Ratnakara that \\"the composer was expected to be a competent performer, but he also made clear that the composer was expected to know his audience, and how their minds work, rising above his own likes and dislikes, in order to bring delight to everyone\\". Sarangadeva's views on music, states Fletcher, exemplified ideas in the Bhagavad Gita relating to non-attachment. Influence ≈öƒÅr·πÖgadeva is one of the most influential medieval era music theorists of the Indian subcontinent, and his book has been called \\"the first modern book on Indian classical music\\". The book is considered by some to be as significant as Bharata's Natya Shastra.

Synopsis  The short film is presented as a trailer for a faux Peanuts television special.Cartoon Brew The \\"special\\" is said to be due for broadcast on Tuesday night at 8:00 p.m., and to be sponsored by a foods company called Madison Barns, \\"makers of Ding Dongs, Twinkies, pooftas and wussy cakes,\\" but the advertisements were only announced and was not shown on the picture. The short begins with the camera moving the left side to Linus, Lucy, and Schroeder, who are freaking out by The Great Pumpkin who literally smokes a cigarette in front of the cast, as he puts a bounty on Charlie Brown's head on a wall, knowing that he is dead or alive, and was prompting the entire Peanuts cast to try to kill him.Simpsons director's Peanuts parody student film online-Animated Views The first clip demonstrates Charlie Brown backing up while Lucy sets up for Charlie. He tells her that she is ready, but she gives him a moment as she strikes a match as she tries to get Charlie Brown to kick a bomb disguised as a football. When she lights the bomb up and calls him a blockhead, Charlie immediately rushes off to the football but when he kicks, it explodes, and goes to the title card. Schroeder then appears acting like normal without his tiny-piano in his hands. Then Charlie came to him and asked Schroeder a question about his piano, but ends up that he dumps his (full- sized, not toy) piano on Charlie Brown's head while Schroeder disobeys Charlie's question as he continues playing his piano while Charlie apologizes to him. Snoopy then prepares to fly like the flying ace from the Great Pumpkin special from 1966, but ends up getting shot by machine guns. Charlie then holds a York Peppermint Pattie (not the character as it was mentioned, as the character does not appear in the short film), and Snoopy bites off his hand (which gushes blood),. Then it goes to the Kite-Eating Tree who falls on him to the left, and goes into the famous bricks area where Linus begins talking to Charlie, but Linus ends up strangling him with his blanket after Charlie recognizes that everyone is after him. Finally tired of running and as he turned to the right while wearing a coat and has a bit of hair, finding Linus, Lucy (holding a spiked bat), Schroeder, and Snoopy; Charlie Brown suddenly dons a mohawk and arms himself with a pump-action shotgun, a submachine gun, and an M16 assault rifle, and says to the other characters to burn in heck with the camera showing Charlie's face while his eyes closed tight. He then systematically kills off the entire Peanuts cast one by one (with an exception of Snoopy being almost shot, but with his brain showing). Charlie then gets shot in the left shoulder by Lucy with a pistol, but then Charlie brings the spiked bat and decapitated Lucy, resulting another blood gush. The film then goes on a strange montage in which Charlie Brown guns down everyone in his way: scores of Mexican banditos, a Wehrmacht machine gun nest behind which Adolf Hitler is painting a picture of a flower while 2 other militiamen were hunting (then gets shot), and Richard Simmons doing jumping jacks (who also gets shot. Not only he gets shot, but also falls off a window while shots were fired at him). This is followed by his innocent sister, Sally, being decapitated by an ax. Following this is a montage of a small dragon breathing flames, Pig Pen vomiting profusely in Violet's face, two biplanes colliding in midair, Dagwood Bumstead getting kicked in the groin by his wife, Blondie (which causes his head to pop off, resulting in yet another blood gush), Mickey Mouse getting hit over the head by a lead pipe while laughing, Rocky Balboa getting punched in the face by Popeye, and Godzilla squeezing Dr. Pepper out of a giant soda can. It then ends with the camera moving to the right with various characters, including some taken to the hospital, some lying on ground, and even one committing suicide by hanging on gallows. Charlie Brown then announced while holding his 2 guns that \\"Happiness is a warm Uzi\\" in a thick Arnold Schwarzenegger accent, and cuts to him smoking a cigarette in bed with the Little Red-Haired Girl (who, fittingly, is not fully seen), who asks Charlie Brown to turn off the bedroom light and goes to sleep.BCDBLetterboxd The song \\"Charlie Brown\\" by The Coasters plays over the end credits (where it is incorrectly attributed to The Platters). The credits end with a note from Jim Reardon:  References to other media  Jim Reardon makes several references to Sam Peckinpah films throughout the short. For example, the title itself ‚Äì as well as the basic plot ‚Äì is a play on Peckinpah's Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. The title is borrowed from National Lampoon 's parody of TV Guide. The Peanuts massacre is a major satire of the climax in Sam Peckinpah's classic film The Wild Bunch. There are slow- motion death scenes intercut with rapid shots, much like Peckinpah's editing style. Violet's death scene, in which she spins around with her revolver, is a copy of Herrera's death scene at the start of the gun battle. The sequence in which Lucy shoots at Charlie Brown from behind and he spins around screaming and consequently kills her with a shotgun is shot-for-shot taken from the sequence where the prostitute shoots William Holden in the back. There is even a part where Charlie Brown waves his submachine gun around, screaming the famous Warren Oates scream, and the camera pan across several Mexican bandits being blown away. An interesting note is that Reardon actually uses sound bites from the movie in these two previous scenes. The references to Peckinpah are made even more clear at the end of the film when Reardon dedicates it to Sam \\"The Man\\" Peckinpah. There are some non-Peckinpah references made in the short, such as Charlie Brown's mohawk (a reference to Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver) and Lucy's speaking in a John Wayne drawl. Reardon also identifies Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz as \\"Charles M. 'Dutch' Schulz,\\" as in mobster Dutch Schultz. Godzilla squeezing the giant Dr. Pepper can is a reference to the then-recent Dr. Pepper ad campaign featuring the famed monster surrounding the 1985 American release of The Return of Godzilla (retitled Godzilla 1985 for that release). When Charlie Brown's arm is bitten off by Snoopy, the screaming sound effect is that from the Tom and Jerry cartoons (and not Peter Robbins's similar-sounding yell that was used in most Peanuts specials up to that point). When Charlie Brown is being strangled by Linus, the sound effects are from the Monty Python skit \\"Farewell to John Denver\\".Farewell To John Denver by Monty Python-Topic on YouTube The brief image of a small fire-breathing dragon is from Snookles, an animated short by Juliet Stroud, which, like this film, was produced at the California Institute of the Arts in 1986.Snookles (1986)-IMDB  Cast and credits  *Charlie Brown ‚Äì Etienne Badillo, Rich Moore, Mike Reardon, William Holden *Linus van Pelt ‚Äì Ethan Kafner *Lucy van Pelt ‚Äì Bret Haaland *Great Pumpkin ‚Äì Jeff Pidgeon *Additional Voices ‚Äì Ed Bell, Bruce Johnson, Mike Reardon, Bret Haaland *Narration ‚Äì Rich Moore *\\"Aided and Abetted by\\" ‚Äì Ed Bell, Dale McBeath, Bob Winquist, Mike Giaimo, Craig Smith, Bret Haaland, Nate Kanfer, Doug Frankel, Mike Reardon, Rich Moore, Russ Edmonds, Hal Ambro, Dan Hansen, Jim Ryan, Tony Fucile, Jeff Pidgeon, Bob McCrea, Sarge Morton, Mom, Eileen, and Beverly * Dedicated to Sam \\"The Man\\" Peckinpah * \\"Peanuts Theme ‚Äì Vince Guaraldi * \\"Charlie Brown\\" ‚Äì The Coasters * A Jim Reardon Cartoon ‚Äì Made at Cal Arts, U.S.A.

Organized by personality, it is an exhaustive inventory of those involved in international cinema, whether contemporary or historical, elite or esoteric. Beyond its scope, the tome is most notable for infusing subjectivity into its fact-based form; the technique may best be described as a playful deconstruction of the \\"reference book.\\" It is currently available in its sixth edition, released in May 2014. The New Biographical Dictionary of Film has garnered wide acclaim throughout the releases of its various editions; in a 2010 poll by the British Film Institute, it was voted the greatest of all books about film. Overview Fourth edition press notes from Random House: :: For almost thirty years, David Thomson‚Äôs Biographical Dictionary of Film has been not merely ‚Äúthe finest reference book ever written about movies‚Äù (Graham Fuller, Interview), not merely the ‚Äúdesert island book‚Äù of art critic David Sylvester, not merely ‚Äúa great, crazy masterpiece‚Äù (Geoff Dyer, The Guardian), but also ‚Äúfiendishly seductive‚Äù (Greil Marcus, Rolling Stone). ::This new edition updates the older entries and adds 30 new ones: Darren Aronofsky, Emmanuelle B√©art, Jerry Bruckheimer, Larry Clark, Jennifer Connelly, Chris Cooper, Sofia Coppola, Alfonso Cuaron, Richard Curtis, Sir Richard Eyre, Sir Michael Gambon, Christopher Guest, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Spike Jonze, Wong Kar-Wai, Laura Linney, Tobey Maguire, Michael Moore, Samantha Morton, Mike Myers, Christopher Nolan, Dennis Price, Adam Sandler, Kevin Smith, Kiefer Sutherland, Charlize Theron, Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, Lew Wasserman, Naomi Watts, and Ray Winstone. ::In all, the book includes more than 1300 entries, some of them just a pungent paragraph, some of them several thousand words long. In addition to the new ‚Äúmusts,‚Äù Thomson has added key figures from film history‚Äìlively anatomies of Graham Greene, Eddie Cantor, Pauline Kael, Abbott and Costello, No√´l Coward, Hoagy Carmichael, Dorothy Gish, Rin Tin Tin, and more. ::Here is a great, rare book, one that encompasses the chaos of art, entertainment, money, vulgarity, and nonsense that we call the movies. Personal, opinionated, funny, daring, provocative, and passionate, it is the one book that every filmmaker and film buff must own. Time Out named it one of the ten best books of the 1990s. Gavin Lambert recognized it as ‚Äúa work of imagination in its own right.‚Äù Now better than ever‚Äìa masterwork by the man playwright David Hare called ‚Äúthe most stimulating and thoughtful film critic now writing.‚Äù Although it looks very much like a dictionary or encyclopedia, each of the book's approximately 5,000 brief biographical sketches is highly subjective: a typical entry may begin with a birthplace and filmography but always concludes with something closer to criticism and memoir as the author examines his connection to the subject's career both academically and personally. Thomson‚Äôs entry on Tom Cruise, for example, opens by considering the actor‚Äôs age, recognizing that detractors see him as ‚Äúrepresentative of all that is most immature in American cinema today.‚Äù Thomson notes that Clark Gable was a rising star at thirty: ‚ÄúNow, in our collective recollection, Gable may seem older, worldlier, and more grown-up than Cruise was at thirty. But when did Gable ever risk playing the jerk to whom Cruise was totally committed in The Color of Money? When was Gable as uninhibitedly tender as Cruise managed in Risky Business? And could Gable have survived the black-hole narcissism of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man?‚Äù The entry closes with the actor‚Äôs late-90s comeback, calling his work in Magnolia, ‚Äúhis most searching and self- critical performance,‚Äù and abandoning objectivity altogether: ‚ÄúSo, after bad years, I remain hopeful, even if all the [Mission:] 'Impossibles' put a greater load on things that might be.‚Äù History The Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd-published first edition‚Äîthe 600-page Biographical Dictionary of Cinema-- was followed by Biographical Dictionary of Film, published by William Morrow & Co in June, 1980; the third, entitled A Biographical Dictionary of Film, would be released on November 17, 1994, by Andre Deutsch Ltd. 328 pages longer than the first edition, it added 200 new entries including Molly Ringwald. The 2004 edition was a major overhaul. Although the book's first edition contained 600 pages, the fourth was enlarged to 1,080 pages, updating older entries and adding 30 new personalities.

It is one of the top clubs in the country. History One of the oldest clubs in Zimbabwe, it was formed in 1931 out of several teams which had their origins from Shona speaking areas but based in Bulawayo. The name Mashonaland United FC was adopted up until 1975 when nationalist leaders such as Dr Herbert Ushewokunze and Dr Joshua Nkomo (both late) felt tribal names were causing divisions among African people. It then changed its name to Zimbabwe Saints Football Club. Among some of its early players include the late Vice President of Zimbabwe and the patron of ZIFA, Honourable Joseph Msika. The \\"Chauya Chikwata\\" as it's nicknamed was arguably one of the best teams in the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League in the 1980s and early 1990s. Famous for its youth development, the club has been home to some of the finest footballers to ever grace the Zimbabwean national team such as Joseph Machingura, Agent Sawu, Muzondiwa Mugadza, Ronald Sibanda, Henry McKop, Ephraim Chawanda, Gibson Homela, John Sibanda, Ebson \\"Sugar\\" Muguyo to name just a few. The most famous class of 1988 coached by Roy Baretto went on a 23-game unbeaten streak to capture the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League Championship in style. They were also losing semi-finalists of CECAFA Club championships in 1988. It went on to play in the CAF Club Champions Cup in 1989 and was eliminated in the quarter finals. In-club fighting has been the major cause of the club's decline. The club was demoted 2 times in 2004 and 2006. In 2007 a new executive led by seasoned administrator Elliot Manduna was elected into office. Since then the club has been on a rebuilding exercise. It introduced a development side currently playing in Division Two. Club House Zimbabwe Saints F.C. is one of the few teams in Zimbabwe who own sporting facilities. The sports club or clubhouse as it is popularly known is situated in Queens Park East, north-east of Bulawayo. Besides a soccer pitch, other sporting facilities at the clubhouse include tennis courts, netball court, volleyball court and darts. There is also a sports bar used by the members and supporters. Merger On Saturday 31 January 2009, the Life members of the club voted in favour of a merger with Njube Sundowns Football Club another Bulawayo based club. This was not successful but in February 2011, they bought the franchise of Chitungwiza-based Zimbabwe Premier League outfit Eagles. Zimbabwe Saints were relegated from the Premier Soccer League in 2006. The return of Zimbabwe Saints in 2011 into the premiership would bring more excitement into the league in Bulawayo. The city already has Highlanders and Chicken Inn in the Premier League. On May 3, 2016, Zimbabwe Saints have been expelled from the Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Two League, for failing to affiliate and fulfil three consecutive matches.

Jamieson (also known as Jamie Jamieson) was a native of Evanston, Illinois and studied at Northwestern University. He began his career in ballet, but by the mid-1940s was an internationally recognized Scottish dance champion. In 1947, de Mille hired Jamieson to coach the cast of Brigadoon in traditional Scottish dancing, which inaugurated a decades-long association with the musical. (He had earlier worked with de Mille on the first national tour of Oklahoma!) Jamieson replaced James Mitchell as Harry Beaton, then went on to play Harry on tour, overseas, and in assorted stock productions. In New York, he recreated de Mille's choreography for Brigadoon at New York City Center in 1957, on Broadway in 1980, and at New York City Opera in 1986 and 1991; in addition, he was de Mille's assistant for the 1963 City Center revival, which starred Edward Villella as Harry. De Mille also featured Jamieson in the Agnes de Mille Dance Theatre and the Heritage Dance Theatre, as well as in television specials. Besides his various productions of Brigadoon, Jamieson choreographed for a number of regional and stock theatres, working with such stars as Judy Holliday. He had considerably greater influence, however, as a dance teacher. With Helena Antonova, he opened the Academy of the Dance in 1956 in Wilmington, Delaware; his students there included modern dancer Tina Fehlandt, Scottish dancer Victor Wesley, and choreographer Susan Stroman. In 1967, he began his celebrated productions of Tchaikovsky‚Äôs \\"The Nutcracker Ballet\\" and for 27 consecutive years, produced, directed and performed various roles in the work.The Scottish-American History Club Newsletter, July, 1996, Page 3 Mr. Jamieson died on Christmas Day, 1993, nine days after he appeared as the grandmother in the opening night presentation of the Academy of the Dance's 27th production of \\"The Nutcracker\\".Highland Highlights, by Loraine Ritchey The Delaware Community Foundation offers the James Jamieson Memorial Scholarship to ballet students on a competitive basis.

The history of The 'Burg starts back in 1958 when small broadcast facility, KCAT, started broadcasting on 880 AM. The 'Burg, now KCWU, has expanded its broadcast facility. It now broadcasts 430 watts effective radiated power at a frequency of 88.1 MHz. The 'Burg offers a wide variety of programming, including new college alternative rock (that is reported to CMJ), talk radio, and specialty shows during the night hours that feature spotlights on specific genres (they have shows highlighting electronica, hip-hop, world music, local northwest music, blues, heavy metal, punk rock, classic rock, reggae, singer/songwriter music and many other unique subgenres of rock). History =KCAT (1958‚Äì1998)= KCAT began transmitting on 880 AM in 1958 as a carrier current station. In 1962, The FCC granted the Central Washington College of Education Board of Trustees a non-commercial, educational FM broadcast license to operate KCWS, a 10-Watt FM Broadcast station. KCWS 91.5 FM signed on the air on April 29, broadcasting from the same building as KCAT 880 AM. Ten years later, Central Washington State College of Education lost its FM broadcast station. It was unpopular with most students due to its classical music and talk/documentary format . In 1973, KCAT AM broadcast facility moved to the Student Union Building, but it was destroyed in a fire in the Summer of 1976. In 1980, KCAT then switched from carrier current AM to and FM cable station, transmitting its signal through King Video Cable in Ellensburg. In April 1992, KCAT officially separated from the CWU Communications Department because of limited faculty and budget, and declining student interest in radio degrees. In March 1995, The CWU Service and Activities Fee Committee granted money to KCAT to once again facilitate the process of obtaining an FCC broadcast license. On July 1, 1995, KCAT became an officially recognized department under the CWU Division of Student Affairs. KCAT obtained its Construction Permit on March 3, 1998, to build a 500-Watt, non-commercial educational FM broadcast station at 88.1 MHz, with tower site located at 1300 North Pfenning Road in Ellensburg. Two months later, KCAT was given the call letters \\"KCWU\\" by the FCC, to use once it signs over the air. The call letters were changed because \\"KCAT\\" already existed in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. =KCWU in the SUB (1998‚Äì2006)= On September 19, 1998, KCWU-FM began 24/7 live operation, under the leadership of General Manager Chris Hull. The Burg's first remote broadcast aired April 30, 1999 at noon from the gazebo at 4th and Pearl in downtown Ellensburg. In October 2001, The 'Burg began the Fireside Chat broadcast series, featuring (for the first time in the station's history) live broadcasts from the CWU President's home once every quarter. The broadcast occurs before a live studio audience of CWU students, and is designed as an intimate forum for them to discuss and address their concerns and issues to the President and the four University Vice Presidents in a very informative Q&A; format. In the same month, then Promotion Director Kevin Tighe began \\"Rock Night with The 'Burg\\" now known as \\"Alley Ice with The 'Burg\\", was implemented as a live music and contest broadcast from the local Rodeo Bowl bowling alley every Wednesday night from 9pm to Midnight. =KCWU in the SURC (2006‚Äì)= On March 6, 2006, The Burg temporarily suspended live talent as they transitioned into their new state-of-the-art facility in the new SUB/Recreation Facility. On August 3, 2006, KCWU-FM began audio transmission from its new broadcast studios in the SURC. They also adapted for live radio streaming from their website, broadcasting worldwide. In March 2015, KCWU was named 2015 Best College Radio Station (With enrollment of 10,000 students or more) by the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System at their 75th annual College Media Conference, held in New York City. Program funding The radio station is largely funded by fees paid by the Central Washington University student body and from local underwriting. Guests KCWU has hosted several notable guest interviews, and live in-studio performances. Many of these were made possible by the upgrade of station facilities in 2006, including the addition of a performance studio (\\"The SoundHouse\\"). =Interviewees= *Aileen Paron *Steve Anderson, F*CK director *Alison Arngrim, Little House on the Prairie *Dan Bern *Brendan B.

Keenan has won the NLL GM of the Year award and the Les Bartley Award for Coach of the Year three times each; he won both awards in 2006, 2010, and 2014 though he shared the 2010 Bartley Award with Chris Hall. After a long amateur career, (with the Oshawa Green Gaels and the Brooklin Redmen of the Ontario Junior and Senior Leagues respectively, and Ithaca College where he made All-American), and appearances with the Canadian National Field team at several world championships, Keenan began professional play in 1992 with the Buffalo Bandits, where he won the 1992 Rookie of the Year Award. The Bandits won the Champions Cup in both of Keenan's seasons with the team. After a five-year break, he played six games with the Toronto Rock in 1999, before becoming an assistant coach under Les Bartley. The Rock won the 1999 NLL Championship, and with Bartley at the helm and Keenan and Ed Comeau as assistant coaches, the Rock went to the championship game in each of the next four seasons, winning three times, in 2000, 2002, and 2003. In November 2003, Bartley stepped down due to his battle with colon cancer, and Keenan was promoted to interim general manager, while Comeau was given the job of interim head coach. However, less than four months later, after a 2‚Äì4 start, both Keenan and Comeau were fired by the Rock, replaced by Terry Sanderson. In 2005, Keenan was hired by the Anaheim Storm, becoming their head coach and general manager. He improved the Storm from a dismal 1‚Äì15 record in 2004 to a 5‚Äì11 record in 2005. However, the Storm folded after the 2005 season due to low attendance. In July 2005, Keenan was named head coach and general manager of the then-unnamed Portland expansion franchise. The team was named the \\"LumberJax\\", and finished the 2006 season 11‚Äì5, becoming the first expansion team in NLL history to finish first in its division. Keenan was awarded both the GM of the Year Award and the Les Bartley Award for coach of the year. As of November 2012 he was the coach of the Edmonton Rush of the National Lacrosse League. He was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in November, 2012http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/11/17/edmonton-rush- coach-and-gm-named-to-canadian-lacrosse-hall-of-fame Keenan is the second cousin of NHL head coach Mike Keenan.

The company also had a key role in time-temperature research done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1895 to 1896, which led to the development of food science and food technology as a profession.  History  = Canned foods = William Underwood (1787-1864). Before moving to the United States in 1819, William Underwood worked as an apprentice at Mackey & Company in London, bottling food and exporting it to South America. He moved to the United States in 1817, arriving at New Orleans. The William Underwood Company of Boston was established by William Underwood (1787‚Äì1864) in 1822 in Boston, Massachusetts, as a condiment company using glass packing techniques. Among the condiments and other items glass packed were mustard, ketchup of various kinds, many types of pickled vegetables, and cranberries, primarily focusing on mustard and pickling. By 1836, Underwood shifted his packing from glass to steel cans coated with tin on the inside because glassmakers in the Boston area could not keep up with product demands from the canning company.Shaw, F. H. (1957). The history of the William Underwood Company, 1821-1954. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Harvard University. (HU 90.7263, film 6209.) Pp. 13-14. The company shipped its products to South America, the West Indies and in Asia. In 1939, the bookkeepers of the William Underwood Company standardized the use of the word 'can' instead of 'tin canister'. Underwood's canned foods proved valuable to settlers during the Manifest Destiny period of 1840‚Äì60. Later, Underwood sold numerous canned foods to Union troops during the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì65. The amount of products canned increased to include seafood products, such as lobster, oyster, and mackerel. William Underwood died in 1864, the same year that William Lyman Underwood, one of his three grandsons, was born. Underwood's son, William James Underwood, would head the business as new retort technology continued to be developed for use. In 1880, Underwood opened the first sardine factory in Jonesport, Maine, known as one of the largest sardine factories in the world. In 1896, the William Underwood Company started to export its spread ham to Venezuela, leading to the creation of the brand 'Diablitos Underwood deviled ham' in 1960 by General Mills. In 1906, the Massachusetts Board of Health banned all deviled meats, except Underwood's, from sale in Massachusetts.Shaw, pp. 95‚Äì96 The National Billposters' Association, based in Chicago, center of America's meat packing industry at the time, then banned its members from posting bills with devil images on them.Shaw, p. 96 In 1907, a shipment of Underwood canned goods was denied entry on the territory by the Argentinian customs because small traces of boric acid were found in the canned foods. = Research with MIT = From its beginning, the company encountered the problem of cans swelling, causing a great deal of product loss. In late 1895, William Lyman Underwood, a grandson of the founder, asked MIT for assistance with this problem. Underwood approached William Thompson Sedgwick, the chair of the biology department at MIT about the concerns he had with product swells and explosion of cans of clams. Sedgwick conferred with his assistant, Samuel Cate Prescott, and from late 1895 to late 1896, Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon, focusing on canned clams. They discovered that the clams contained heat-resistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing; then they learned that these spores' presence depended on the clams' living environment, and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250¬∞F (121¬∞C) for 10 minutes in a retort.Goldblith, pp. 21-3. These studies prompted the similar research of canned lobster, sardines, peas, tomatoes, corn, and spinach.Goldblith, p. 22 Prescott and Underwood's work was first published in late 1897. This research, which was never patented,Goldblith, p. 24 proved beneficial to the William Underwood Company, the canning industry, the food industry, and food technology itself.Goldblith, p. 28 In the mid-1950s, outgoing company president W. Durant brought new president George Seybolt to MIT to meet Prescott.Goldblith, p. 125 At the Institute of Food Technologists Northeast Section (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) meeting at Watertown, Massachusetts, in April 1961, the William Underwood Company dedicated a new laboratory in honor of both Prescott and William Lyman Underwood.Goldblith, pp. 125-6. Following Prescott's death in 1962, the William Underwood Company created the Underwood Prescott Memorial Lectureship in memory of both Underwood and Prescott.Goldblith, p. 128 This Lectureship would run until 1982. In 1969, Seybolt donated $600,000 to MIT to create the Underwood Professorship, followed up with an Underwood Prescott Professorship in 1972.Goldblith, p. 130. Three MIT faculty have held this professorship since its inception: Samuel A. Goldblith, Gerald N. Wogan, and since 1996, Steven R. Tannenbaum. = Expansion in 1960s = Underwood acquired the Appert label in 1964, and the Burnham & Morrill (B&M;) Company of Portland, Maine, in 1965.B&M; History B&M; had actually purchased canned clams and tomatoes from Underwood in the late 1860s for resale before producing these products on its own. Baked beans were the best known product that B&M; produced, which it began doing in the 1920s with its Brick Oven Baked Beans. Piermont Foods, a food company in Montreal, Canada, was acquired in 1968 in order for Underwood to sell its products north of the border. In 1974, Underwood acquired the canned goods producer Shippam's. = Sale to PET = Underwood, which up to this point had been privately owned by the Underwood family, was sold to Pet, Inc., in 1982.B&G; History at FundingUniverse B&M; Foods was included as part of the sale, and the Underwood headquarters building in Westwood, Massachusetts, was closed as a result. Thirteen years later, in 1995, the Pillsbury Company acquired Pet, Inc., and began a modernization process that included warehousing, production, and processing. In 1999, New York's B&G; Foods acquired the Underwood foods business, including the line of Underwood's canned meat spreads, sardines, B&M; products, and Accent.  Deviled ham and devil logo  Underwood first canned deviled ham in 1868 as a mixture of ground ham with seasonings; deviling would also be done with other meat and seafood products, including turkey, chicken, tongue and lobster. Deviling consists of adding such spices as pepper sauce, cayenne pepper, Dijon mustard, or chopped chili peppers. Deviled eggs are one well-known example of this process. The devil logo was trademarked in 1870 and the company claims in its own literature that it is the oldest food trademark still in use in the United States. The red devil that debuted in 1895 and started as a demonic figure evolved into a much friendlier version when compared to the original. The older version, in use during the first half of the 20th century, can be seen in many old magazine advertisements, such as one from Woman's Home Companion, August 1921.Woman's Home Companion. (Aug, 1921). P. 65. It lacks the pitchfork and smile of the modern version, but has long fingernails or claws not found in the modern version. The barbed tail is in the shape of the letter W, and along with the lower-case M to the right of the devil forms the abbreviation \\"Wm.\\", for William, as in William Underwood. The lettering in the logo and on the can are also spouting small flames, reinforcing the spicy devil concept. In 2008, B&G; Foods updated the devil logo by adding color to the previously all-red image. The pitchfork became black, and small amounts of yellow were added in the tail and horns, along with shading to add depth. The yellow in the tail and horns, however, was later removed. The devil logo has appeared on Underwood products that are not deviled as part of the overall brand identity, such as sardines, liverwurst spread and chicken breast. In the 1980s, an animated version of the devil logo was created for TV advertising. Other companies have made deviled ham products. In 1895, at least seven other companies produced their own versions of a deviled ham, among them Armour and Company, and in 1900 Libby's entered the market with its own deviled ham product.Shaw, pp. 93‚Äì94.

They mainly live in the east of the country, in the province of Overijssel, in such cities as Enschede, Hengelo, Rijssen, Almelo and Borne. The main reason that the Assyrians are concentrated there is because it is an industrial area which lies at the Germany‚ÄìNetherlands border, where a large German Assyrian population resides. Many Assyrians in the Netherlands have relatives in Germany. History The first Assyrians came to the Netherlands in the 1970s as a result of fights between the PKK and the Turkish army. Most of them were from the province of Mardin in southeastern Turkey, where the aforementioned conflict took place. In the 1980s, Assyrians from Syria, with almost all of them being from the originally Assyrian city of Qamishli (Syriac: ‹í‹¨ ‹ô‹†‹ù‹¢ Bet Zalin), began to emigrate to the Netherlands. The latest group of Assyrians to migrate to the Netherlands are from Iraq, and they have been arriving there since the first Gulf War. The large majority of Turkish and Syrian Assyrians in the Netherlands belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church since they are from the western part of the Assyrian homeland, where the Syriac Orthodox Church is the most prominent. In the 1980s, as with other immigrants in Europe, a strong feeling of nationalism started to develop among the Assyrians in the Netherlands. This sentiment started to make Assyrians be active in working for projects that helped them preserve their identity. A few projects that started out were Assyrian society building, Assyrians churches and Assyrians language classes, which were being given in Dutch schools to Assyrian children and also on weekends in so-called Bible school classes. They also started camps for Assyrians youth and Assyrian music and dance classes were offered in the community. For adult Assyrians, lectures on society building and many social events were organized. Since 1981 there has been a Syriac Orthodox monastery in the village Glane near the German border. The Assyrians began to organize demonstrations to bring their situation in the Assyrian homeland to the attention of the media and to bring the 20th century Assyrian genocide to the attention of the Dutch government. Current situation The Assyrians have managed to both integrate into Dutch society and maintain their own ethnic identity, as there are a lot of social events organized by Assyrian clubs. Some of the latest projects which Assyrians in the Netherlands have started are: the Seyfo Center, the Assyrian Church Choir, representation of Assyrians in the Dutch government (such as Attiya Gamri), and the foundation of the Assyrian Youth Movement (AJF). Assyrians in the Netherlands mostly belong to Syriac Orthodox Church, but there is also a small community belonging to the Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church. The first Assyrians mainly worked in factories or opened restaurants, but today, mostly attend university and work in all sectors of the economy.

Introduction  The primary passenger service on the Marton‚ÄìNew Plymouth Line was the New Plymouth Express between Wellington and New Plymouth. It was augmented by three slower mixed trains that ran south from New Plymouth daily. In 1926, patronage was sufficiently high to justify replacing one of the mixed trains with a dedicated passenger service between New Plymouth and Whanganui. This train came to be known as the Taranaki Flyer.  Operation  For most of its life, the Taranaki Flyer was a carriage train hauled by steam locomotives, and when it was introduced, it took approximately 4.5 hours to complete its journey. On 31 October 1955, the carriage trains were replaced by more economical railcars. The railcars were of the Standard and 88 seater types of the RM class. During the railcar period, the northbound train was no. 524 and the southbound train was no. 525.Tony Hurst, Farewell to Steam: Four Decades of Change on New Zealand Railways (Auckland: Harper Collins Publishers, 1995), pg. 74.  Demise  During the 1950s, the effect of commercial airlines and private cars started to reduce patronage on New Zealand's passenger trains significantly. Although the introduction of railcars prolonged the life of many other provincial services in New Zealand, it was not successful for the Taranaki Flyer. On 7 February 1959, the service ran for the last time. The final train no. 524 was handled by an 88-seater, RM 116, and a Standard railcar ran train no. 525, RM 30 Aotea.Hurst, Farewell to Steam, pg. 74.  AB 745 Taranaki Flyer Project  There is also a locomotive that has been nicknamed the Taranaki Flyer, AB class no.745. This locomotive, made in 1922 by the North British Locomotive Company, is currently under restoration by the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust. It derailed on 16 July 1956 as a result of a washout near Hawera while hauling a freight train from Whanganui to New Plymouth. Both crew survived, but the locomotive was too expensive to recover and was buried in situ, with the repaired railway embankment built directly over it. The engine lay undisturbed until November 2001, and in 2002 it was salvaged minus tender, which was in poor condition, and taken to Waitara. In 2007, the Taranaki Flyer Society formed to restore the locomotive, and it was transported to the old railway goods shed at Stratford. The Society, however, became low on funds and lost its lease on the shed. It offered the locomotive to other preservation groups and accepted an offer from the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust. The locomotive has been based at that group's workshops in Maymorn since October 2013. It is currently under restoration, with the long-term objective of returning it to operation.Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust, Steam locomotive Ab 745.

The film is about a tour guide whose life takes a personal detour, while her group gets entangled in comic situations among the ruins, with a series of unexpected stops along the way. The film was released on June 5, 2009 in the United States, and May 7, 2009 in Greece. Hollywood Entertainment. Retrieved on March 19, 2009 Plot Georgia (Nia Vardalos) is a Greek American teacher who came to Greece to teach at a local college about Classic Greece. However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything. Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico (Alistair McGowan), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours. As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis). In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour and Maria can find another tour guide more tolerant to her and Nico. One day, an older traveller named Irv Gideon (Richard Dreyfuss), helps Georgia see why she can't connect with the group: she finds them annoying and is bored with her current job. Therefore, he shows her how to have fun and teach her how to be more engaging to the tourists. This helps Georgia learn more about the current group of tourists she has and open her eyes to the different places where they come from. In doing so, she also teaches them the origins of the Olympic Games, which they take genuine interest in. While they become more immersed in Greek culture, Poupi begins to show interest in Georgia. However, Georgia's antics distract him while driving, and he narrowly avoids causing an accident on the road. At the hotel they're staying at, Georgia's attractive female members of her group manages to stall a hurt Nico as Georgia, Irv and Poupi secretly sabotage his tour bus by stealing the air conditioning from it to install in her own bus. As the group begins to enjoy themselves at the beach, Irv becomes sick and they take him to the hospital. Georgia is unsure if she should continue and is concerned for Irv's health until Poupi encourages her to do so. During her group's tour of the Parthenon, Georgia tells them why she likes coming there because at the right time, she could feel the wind from the ruins. While his own group looks around, Nico confronts Georgia and her group. Georgia realizes she ended up with the better group when he reveals that without air conditioning on his tour bus, Nico got a serious headache from having to hear his group complaining the entire time and he never bothered getting to know them. When Nico openly insults his group in front of Georgia and her group by calling them Americans, the Canadians are offended by this and start trying to beat him up. Georgia and her group visit the hospital where Irv is recovering well. At night when the group is celebrating the farewell party at a Greek buffet, Maria confronts Georgia for the letter and convinces her to stay with a promise of a raise after she produces the review logs with good reviews with her current group of tourists. She even admitted that she was glad Nico quit since she never liked being around him and only tolerated Nico because she knew his parents very well. Georgia begins a relationship with Poupi.

It was a Lutheran Church, consecrated in 1868. Under the patronage of The Norwegian Seamen's Mission provided home comforts, communication with family and a place of worship for Scandinavian sailors and the Norwegian community in Cardiff for over a hundred years. History In the 19th century, Cardiff was one of Britain's three major ports, along with London and Liverpool. The Norwegian merchant fleet at the time was the third largest in the world, and Cardiff became one of the major centres of its operations. Sj√∏mannskirken ‚Äì the Norwegian Church Abroad organisation, which is part of the Church of Norway ‚Äì followed in its footsteps. Under Carl Herman Lund from Oslo, a Church was built in 1868 in Cardiff Bay between the East and West Docks on land donated by the John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, to serve the religious needs of Norwegian sailors and expatriates. Consecrated in December 1868, the church was clad in iron sheets on the instruction of the harbourmaster, to allow it to be moved if necessary. However, the construction form allowed it to be extended many times: *1883: Reading room enlarged *1885: Gallery and bell- tower added *1894: Reading room enlarged, reclad in wood Known until this point as the Norwegian Iron Church, it now became known as the Little White Church, and became a welcome home point for sailors. Resultantly, and open to all sailors as a mission offering food and shelter, between 1867 and 1915 the number of visiting sailors to the church rose from 7,572 to 73,580 seamen per annum. = Original Community = When the church was in its prime it had a lot of public activity; from the Nordic community settling in Cardiff and making roots there, to the Norwegian sailors using the place as a rest stop on their travels. The church had become a home away from home for the sailors during World War II as they weren't able to go back to Norway due to Nazi occupation. The church hosted many important family occasions, such as weddings and christenings, for the community as well as more educational projects like cookery classes. =Decline= Even pre-World War I, coal exports from Cardiff were in decline. Post World War II, shipping trade had moved from Cardiff, and in 1959 the mission's work was discontinued. In the early 1960s, the Norwegian Seamen's Mission withdrew its patronage, and the last seaman's priest Per Konrad Hansen was withdrawn. The residual congregation and other Lutheran organisations funded its continued use by the resident expatriate Norwegian community. It was closed and de-consecrated in 1974. =Preservation= Norwegian Church, Cardiff In light of developments in Cardiff Bay in the late 1980s, and the proposed building of new roads around Atlantic Wharf, the now derelict and vandalised church was threatened with total destruction. The community formed the Norwegian Church Preservation Trust, to save the building in the redeveloped docks. In partnership with the Norwegian Support Committee in Bergen, the trust raised ¬£250,000, enabling the church to be dismantled in 1987, preserved and stored pending reassembly. The remaining original features were rescued, including the pulpit, one side- window, the chandelier and the model-ship; all of which were returned to the church. With the Wales Millennium Centre built on its original site, with land donated by Associated British Ports, in 1992 reconstruction on the current site was started. In April 1992, the church was re-opened by Princess M√§rtha Louise of Norway.  Roald Dahl  The writer Roald Dahl, who was born in Cardiff to Norwegian parents, was baptised in the church, as were his sisters. The family worshipped in the church. Throughout his life Dahl had ties with the church and in the 1970s when the church first fell into a state of disrepair, Dahl was at the forefront of a campaign to raise money to save it. This led to Dahl being appointed the first president of The Norwegian Church Preservation Trust after it was set up in 1987 by the church. A room in the church is named 'The Dahl Gallery', in memory of Dahl and to commemorate what he did for the church. In this room is; * The silver christening bowl used to baptise Dahl and his siblings. * A shield given to the church's pastor as a gift, as during WW2 the church was home to sailors who couldn't return to their homeland. * An anchor and oars in the shape of a cross. The oars are believed to be from a Norwegian sailing ship and the anchor is a gift to honour the church's maritime heritage. As well as this honour, Dahl is also celebrated yearly in September, the month of his 1916 birth. In 2016 Cardiff Bay celebrated the centenary of Dahl's birth, with a project launched by The Norwegian Church. Present day In 2006 the Norwegian Church Preservation Trust was transferred to Cardiff County Council, under the management of the Cardiff Harbour Authority. The building is now used as an arts centre, and is known as the Norwegian Church Arts Centre. The centre includes a caf√© and an art gallery. In May 2011 the church underwent a ¬£500,000 refurbishment, including a new outdoor terrace and a DDA compliant lift. The Grieg room hosts a diversity of local arts and culture. = Present community = The church has been refurbished, moved and opened in Cardiff Bay, and continues to receive a large number of visitors. Though no longer primarily a resting place and home for Norwegian sailors, it is still open to the public with a gallery and a small caf√© for the remaining Norwegian community to relax and meet in. As the church has a strong link with Roald Dahl, every September the church honours him and his work. As well as this, the community in Cardiff and those involved with the church gather together every year for an annual celebration of Dahl's birthday and Christmas. In 2016 the Norwegian Church led Cardiff Bay's celebrations of the centenary of Dahl's birth. Popular culture A 2008 episode of the BBC Television drama series Torchwood, \\"To The Last Man\\", had some scenes shot outside the church.

She also had fond memories of studying with Los Angeles dance teacher [Dorothy Lynda-ll . In 1932, aged 16, Collins auditioned with success for the prestigious Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, but as she was required to paint her face and skin white in order to be able to perform, she did not join the company. In the 1940s, Collins collaborated with well-known dancer Katherine Dunham and joined the Dunham Company. A turning point in her dance career came in November 1948, when she performed in a one-night program at the Las Palmas Theater in Los Angeles. She earned excellent notices. In 1948, she moved to New York and got the chance to dance her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street YMHA.Pocantico Hills School . In 1949, Collins earned glowing reviews in a variety of performances, including the Broadway production of Cole Porter's musical Out of This World for which she received the Donaldson Award for best dancer on Broadway in 1951. It was in that role that she was noticed by Zachary Solov, then the ballet master of the Met.Janet Collins receiving a kiss from ballet master Zachary Solov after her performance in Aida, Nov. 1951She also performed in Aida, Carmen, and was the first Black ballerina to perform at the Metropolitan Opera in 1951 which she joined the next year and performed at until 1955.

Janet Collins died in 2003 at the age of 86, in Fort Worth, Texas. Legacy Janet Collins' dance reputation today resides primarily in her role in breaking the colour barrier; the constraints on Black classical dancers were too strong for her to have a vibrant performing career. In some Southern cities, race laws kept her off the stage, and her parts were played by understudies. After a performance in Toronto, Dance Magazine reported some years ago, she and a colleague approached the door of an obviously crowded restaurant only to be turned away with the curt statement that the establishment was closed. In 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance. Collins received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1989. In 2007, in recognition of Collins' great work and dedication, her renowned cousin Carmen De Lavallade established the Janet Collins Fellowship to honor aspiring talented ballet dancers.\\"The Carmen De Lavallade Awards for Dance: Janet Collins Fellowship\\" , New York Institute of Dance & Education.

Also winner of the International Youth Jury's prize, the President of the Italian Senate's Gold Medal, and the UNICEF Award at the 1997 Venice Film Festival. The film is about a young woman, Katya (Yekaterina Rednikova), and her 6-year-old son Sanya (Misha Philipchuk), who, in 1952, meet a veteran Soviet officer named Tolyan (Vladimir Mashkov). Katya falls in love with Tolyan, who turns out to be a small time criminal, but who also becomes a father figure to Sanya. Plot Katya, a poor and desperate widow, and her young son Sanya try to survive in the post-World War II Soviet Union during the early 1950s. While on a train, the two meet a handsome, rakish officer, Tolyan, who seduces the mother. Katya stays with Tolyan, who pretends to be her husband and acts as a stepfather to Sanya, who is at first highly distrustful of the man, resenting his presence and authority. There are several allusions to Hamlet. Through his good looks, apparent generosity, and his status as a war veteran, Tolyan charms his way into a variety of situations that enable him rob people. Katya and Sanya both realize the harsh and increasingly abusive nature of the new head of their family, but, although alarmed, neither mother nor child seem willing to leave the man. The extent of Tolyan's love for his new family remains ambiguous throughout the film and provides one of the more compelling elements of the story.

Media coverage Hemant Mehta with Victoria Osteen Nearly a month after the auction, an article about Mehta's experiences appeared on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, leading to a flurry of media coverage. He was featured in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Seattle Times, and the Village Voice, and on National Public Radio. Mehta and Henderson were interviewed about the project on the Fox News program Big Story Primetime in March 2006. Book I Sold My Soul on eBay, published by WaterBrook Press, contains Mehta's observations and critiques of the churches he visited, along with background on how he became an atheist. The foreword was written by Rob Bell of Mars Hill Bible Church. The book also features his latest critiques, including descriptions of his visits to some of the best-known churches in the country including New Life Church (Pastor Ted Haggard), Mars Hill Bible Church (Pastor Rob Bell), and Lakewood Church (Pastor Joel Osteen). It was released on April 17, 2007 and is available as a paperback, e-book, and audiobook.

Discovery and reputation It was discovered in the early 17th century,It makes its first appearance as the first piece of sculpture engraved in the Galleria Giustiniani, 1631, vol. I, pl. 3. reputedly in the ruins of a ten-sided nymphaeum on the Esquiline Hill which thus mistakenly identified as a \\"Temple of Minerva Medica\\"The site of the actual Temple of Minerva Medica, known from ancient references, has not been securely identified. (Platner and Ashby 1929). Pietro Santi Bartoli, also in the 17th century, gave an alternative discovery site, in the Orto di Minerva adjacent to the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, which was widely thought to have been built over a temple of Minerva (dedicated by Pompey the Great in 62 BCE).Haskell and Penny (1981:269) find that \\"both locations seem suspiciously appropriate, and the latter may have been suggested by the connection between the snake and Aesculapius, the god of Medicine\\". On the basis of its quality, it was reputed well into the 19th century to be a copy of a statue by Pheidias, and was included among stucco casts representing Europe's great sculpture that formed part of the German pavilion at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, 1904.The casts are conserved at the Southeast Missouri State University (news release ). The statue receives its name from having been in the collection of Vincenzo Giustiniani in the Palazzo Giustiniani, which was luxuriously engraved and published as the Galleria Giustiniana (Rome, 1631). Apparently the sculpture was never copied during the time it was in the Giustiniani collection: Winckelmann never mentioned it, though the austere classical style it exhibits was first isolated and described by him. Towards the end of the century it had become an object of admiration especially among the British visitors: a custodian of the Giustiniani told Goethe that the restored hand was whiter than the rest of the work because the English had kissed it so often.Noted in the exhibition catalogue for Pompeo Batoni, prince of painters in 18th-century Rome, (Edgar Peters Bowron and Peter Bj√∂rn Kerbep, curators), Houston and London, 2007, p. 79.

When the French sculptor Claude Michel, who adopted the Greek name \\"Clodion\\", was a pupil at the French Academy in Rome (1762‚Äì71), he made a refined and highly finished terracotta Minerva that is a pastiche of several approved antiquities, notably the Minerve Giustiniani.Now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 1975.312.6 (on-line catalogue entry). The Minerva Giustiniani as it was called, escaped the fate of the rest of the Giustiniani collection, which had been removed in 1807 during the Napoleonic occupation to Paris, where it was to some extent broken up. In 1815 all that remained of it, in particular about 170 paintings, was purchased by Frederick William III of Prussia and removed to Berlin, where it formed a portion of the royal museum. The Minerva however had been bought by Lucien Bonaparte in 1805, and was installed in the grand hall of his Roman residence, the Palazzo Nunez. In 1817 he sold it to Pope Pius VII who was commissioning the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican Museums. When the Braccio Nuovo was opened in 1822, the sculpture was installed as it is today.

The painting gives the viewer the impression that the wife was a willing party to the sale, which was \\"a genial affair\\" marked by laughter. Wife selling in England was a way of ending an unsatisfactory marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's 1886 novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife at the beginning of the story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him. Although the custom had no basis in law and frequently resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, the attitude of the authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses. Wife selling persisted in England in some form until the early 20th century; according to the jurist and historian James Bryce, writing in 1901, wife sales were still occasionally taking place during his time. In one of the last reported instances of a wife sale in England, a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court in 1913 claimed that she had been sold to one of her husband's workmates for ¬£1. Legal background Wife selling in its \\"ritual form\\" appears to be an \\"invented custom\\" that originated at about the end of the 17th century, although there is an account from 1302 of someone who \\"granted his wife by deed to another man\\". With the rise in popularity of newspapers, reports of the practice become more frequent in the second half of the 18th century. In the words of 20th-century writer Courtney Kenny, the ritual was \\"a custom rooted sufficiently deeply to show that it was of no recent origin\\". Writing in 1901 on the subject of wife selling, James Bryce stated that there was \\"no trace at all in our [English] law of any such right\\", but he also observed that \\"everybody has heard of the odd habit of selling a wife, which still occasionally recurs among the humbler classes in England\\". It was often claimed to be common in rural England, but cleric and folkloricist Sabine Baring-Gould dedicated a whole chapter to it in his book on Devonshire folklore. As a child he witnessed the local poet return from market with a bought wife, and when confronted by the local JP and vicar (both related to SBG) he claimed the sale had been carried out correctly and that it was both legal and Christian.Sabine Baring-Gould, Devonshire Characters and Strange Events, John Lane The Bodley Press, London, 1908 =Marriage= Until the passing of the Marriage Act of 1753, a formal ceremony of marriage before a clergyman was not a legal requirement in England, and marriages were unregistered. All that was required was for both parties to agree to the union, so long as each had reached the legal age of consent, which was 12 for girls and 14 for boys. Women were completely subordinated to their husbands after marriage, the husband and wife becoming one legal entity, a legal status known as coverture. As the eminent English judge Sir William Blackstone wrote in 1753: \\"the very being, or legal existence of the woman, is suspended during the marriage, or at least is consolidated and incorporated into that of her husband: under whose wing, protection and cover, she performs everything\\". Married women could not own property in their own right, and were indeed themselves the property of their husbands. But Blackstone went on to observe that \\"even the disabilities the wife lies under are, for the most part, intended for her protection and benefit. So great a favourite is the female sex of the laws of England\\". =Separation= Five distinct methods of breaking up a marriage existed in the early modern period of English history. One was to sue in the ecclesiastical courts for separation from bed and board (a mensa et thoro), on the grounds of adultery or life-threatening cruelty, but it did not allow a remarriage. From the 1550s, until the Matrimonial Causes Act became law in 1857, divorce in England was only possible, if at all, by the complex and costly procedure of a private Act of Parliament. Although the divorce courts set up in the wake of the 1857 Act made the procedure considerably cheaper, divorce remained prohibitively expensive for the poorer members of society. An alternative was to obtain a \\"private separation\\", an agreement negotiated between both spouses, embodied in a deed of separation drawn up by a conveyancer. Desertion or elopement was also possible, whereby the wife was forced out of the family home, or the husband simply set up a new home with his mistress. Finally, the less popular notion of wife selling was an alternative but illegitimate method of ending a marriage. The Laws Respecting Women, As They Regard Their Natural Rights (1777) observed that, for the poor, wife selling was viewed as a \\"method of dissolving marriage\\", when \\"a husband and wife find themselves heartily tired of each other, and agree to part, if the man has a mind to authenticate the intended separation by making it a matter of public notoriety\\". Although some 19th-century wives objected, records of 18th-century women resisting their sales are non-existent. With no financial resources, and no skills on which to trade, for many women a sale was the only way out of an unhappy marriage. Indeed, the wife is sometimes reported as having insisted on the sale. A wife sold in Wenlock Market for 2s 6d in 1830 was quite determined that the transaction should go ahead, despite her husband's last-minute misgivings: e [the husband] turned shy, and tried to get out of the business, but Mattie mad' un stick to it. 'Er flipt her apern in 'er gude man's face, and said, 'Let be yer rogue. I wull be sold. I wants a change'.\\" For the husband, the sale released him from his marital duties, including any financial responsibility for his wife. For the purchaser, who was often the wife's lover, the transaction freed him from the threat of a legal action for criminal conversation, a claim by the husband for restitution of damage to his property, in this case his wife. Sale It is unclear when the ritualised custom of selling a wife by public auction first began, but it seems likely to have been some time towards the end of the 17th century. In November 1692 \\"John, ye son of Nathan Whitehouse, of Tipton, sold his wife to Mr. Bracegirdle\\", although the manner of the sale is unrecorded. In 1696, Thomas Heath Maultster was fined for \\"cohabiteing in an unlawful manner with the wife of George ffuller of Chinner ... haueing bought her of her husband at 2d.q. the pound\\", and ordered by the peculiar court at Thame to perform public penance, but between 1690 and 1750 only eight other cases are recorded in England. In an Oxford case of 1789 wife selling is described as \\"the vulgar form of Divorce lately adopted\\", suggesting that even if it was by then established in some parts of the country it was only slowly spreading to others. It persisted in some form until the early 20th century, although by then in \\"an advanced state of decomposition\\". In most reports the sale was announced in advance, perhaps by advertisement in a local newspaper. It usually took the form of an auction, often at a local market, to which the wife would be led by a halter (usually of rope but sometimes of ribbon) around her neck, or arm. Often the purchaser was arranged in advance, and the sale was a form of symbolic separation and remarriage, as in a case from Maidstone, where in January 1815 John Osborne planned to sell his wife at the local market. However, as no market was held that day, the sale took place instead at \\"the sign of 'The Coal-barge,' in Earl Street\\", where \\"in a very regular manner\\", his wife and child were sold for ¬£1 to a man named William Serjeant. In July the same year a wife was brought to Smithfield market by coach, and sold for 50 guineas and a horse. Once the sale was complete, \\"the lady, with her new lord and master, mounted a handsome curricle which was in waiting for them, and drove off, seemingly nothing loath to go.\\" At another sale in September 1815, at Staines market, \\"only three shillings and four pence were offered for the lot, no one choosing to contend with the bidder, for the fair object, whose merits could only be appreciated by those who knew them. This the purchaser could boast, from a long and intimate acquaintance.\\" Although the initiative was usually the husband's, the wife had to agree to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that \\"after several biddings she [the wife] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a quart of ale\\". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife \\"in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse\\". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth. Such \\"divorces\\" were not always permanent. In 1826 John Turton sold his wife Mary to William Kaye at Emley Cross for five shillings. But after Kaye's death she returned to her husband, and the couple remained together for the next 30 years. The French widely believed that it was common practice for a man tired of his wife to take her to London's Smithfield to be sold to the highest bidder, but cleric/historian challenged a French cleric who claimed he had read it from a reliable source. He then asked Baring Baring Gould if he knew of the practice, and was forced to admit he had witnessed the sale of the local poet as a child. Despite both the vicar and Justice of the Peace explaining the sale was not legal, the poet insisted it to be so, and they had a happy life together.Sabine Baring-Gould, Devonshire Folk and Folklore Sales became more common in the mid 18th century, the result of husbands being abroad in the military, navy, or being transported to the colonies. It was commonly believed that an absence of 7 years constituted a divorce, so when the first husband returned to find his wife had a new family, the dilemma was solved by the first husband selling his wife in the market place for a nominal sum. It was not recognised as legal, as one wife had to wait for her first husband to die before being able to marry the father of her children. She was given away by her grandson.Barb Drummond, Frolicksome Women & Troublesome Wives: Wife Selling in England, 2018 =Mid-19th century= It was believed during the mid-19th century that wife selling was restricted to the lowest levels of labourers, especially to those living in remote rural areas, but an analysis of the occupations of husbands and purchasers reveals that the custom was strongest in \\"proto-industrial\\" communities. Of the 158 cases in which occupation can be established, the largest group (19) was involved in the livestock or transport trades, fourteen worked in the building trade, five were blacksmiths, four were chimney-sweeps, and two were described as gentlemen, suggesting that wife selling was not simply a peasant custom. The most high-profile case was that of Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos, who is reported to have bought his second wife from an ostler in about 1740. Prices paid for wives varied considerably, from a high of ¬£100 plus ¬£25 each for her two children in a sale of 1865 (equivalent to about ¬£ in ) to a low of a glass of ale, or even free. The lowest amount of money exchanged was three farthings (three-quarters of one penny), but the usual price seems to have been between 2s. 6d. and 5 shillings. According to authors Wade Mansell and Belinda Meteyard, money seems usually to have been a secondary consideration; the more important factor was that the sale was seen by many as legally binding, despite it having no basis in law. Some of the new couples bigamously married, but the attitude of officialdom towards wife selling was equivocal. Rural clergy and magistrates knew of the custom, but seemed uncertain of its legitimacy, or chose to turn a blind eye. Entries have been found in baptismal registers, such as this example from Perleigh in Essex, dated 1782: \\"Amie Daughter of Moses Stebbing by a bought wife delivered to him in a Halter\\". A jury in Lincolnshire ruled in 1784 that a man who had sold his wife had no right to reclaim her from her purchaser, thus endorsing the validity of the transaction. In 1819 a magistrate who attempted to prevent a sale at Ashbourne, Derby, but was pelted and driven away by the crowd, later commented: In some cases, such as that of Henry Cook in 1814, the Poor Law authorities forced the husband to sell his wife rather than have to maintain her and her child in the Effingham workhouse. She was taken to Croydon market and sold for one shilling, the parish paying for the cost of the journey and a \\"wedding dinner\\". =Venue= By choosing a market as the location for the sale, the couple ensured a large audience, which made their separation a widely witnessed fact. The use of the halter was symbolic; after the sale, it was handed to the purchaser as a signal that the transaction was concluded, and in some instances, those involved would often attempt further to legitimate the sale by forcing the winning bidder to sign a contract, recognising that the seller had no further liability for his wife. In 1735, a successful wife sale in St Clements was announced by the common cryer, who wandered the streets ensuring that local traders were aware of the former husband's intention not to honour \\"any debts she should contract\\". The same point was made in an advertisement placed in the Ipswich Journal in 1789: \\"no person or persons to intrust her with my name ... for she is no longer my right\\". Those involved in such sales sometimes attempted to legalise the transaction, as demonstrated by a bill of sale for a wife, preserved in the British Museum. The bill is contained in a petition presented to a Somerset Justice of the Peace in 1758, by a wife who about 18 months earlier had been sold by her husband for ¬£6 6s \\"for the support of his extravagancy\\". The petition does not object to the sale, but complains that the husband returned three months later to demand more money from his wife and her new \\"husband\\". In Sussex, inns and public houses were a regular venue for wife-selling, and alcohol often formed part of the payment. For example, when a man sold his wife at the Shoulder of Mutton and Cucumber in Yapton in 1898, the purchaser paid 7s. 6d. (¬£ in ) and of beer. A sale a century earlier in Brighton involved \\"eight pots of beer\\" and seven shillings (¬£ in ); and in Ninfield in 1790, a man who swapped his wife at the village inn for half a pint of gin changed his mind and bought her back later. Public wife sales were sometimes attended by huge crowds. An 1806 sale in Hull was postponed \\"owing to the crowd which such an extraordinary occurrence had gathered together\\", suggesting that wife sales were relatively rare events, and therefore popular. Estimates of the frequency of the ritual usually number about 300 between 1780 and 1850, relatively insignificant compared to the instances of desertion, which in the Victorian era numbered in the tens of thousands. =Distribution and symbolism= A French depiction of Milord John Bull, heading to Smithfield Market to sell his wife Wife selling appears to have been widespread throughout England, but relatively rare in neighbouring Wales, where only a few cases were reported, and in Scotland where only one has been discovered. The English county with the highest number of cases between 1760 and 1880 was Yorkshire, with forty-four, considerably more than the nineteen reported for Middlesex and London during the same period, despite the French caricature of Milord John Bull \\"booted and spurred, in [London's] Smithfield Market, crying '√† quinze livres ma femme!' [¬£15 for my wife], while Milady stood haltered in a pen\\". In his account, Wives for Sale, author Samuel Pyeatt Menefee collected 387 incidents of wife selling, the last of which occurred in the early 20th century. Historian E. P. Thompson considered many of Menefee's cases to be \\"vague and dubious\\", and that some double-counting had taken place, but he nevertheless agreed that about three hundred were authentic, which when combined with his own research resulted in about four hundred reported cases. Menefee argued that the ritual mirrored that of a livestock sale‚Äîthe symbolic meaning of the halter; wives were even occasionally valued by weight, just like livestock. Although the halter was considered central to the \\"legitimacy\\" of the sale, Thompson has suggested that Menefee may have misunderstood the social context of the transaction. Markets were favoured not because livestock was traded there, but because they offered a public venue where the separation of husband and wife could be witnessed. Sales often took place at fairs, in front of public houses, or local landmarks such as the obelisk at Preston (1817), or Bolton's \\"gas pillar\\" (1835), where crowds could be expected to gather. There were very few reported sales of husbands, and from a modern perspective, selling a wife like a chattel is degrading, even when considered as a form of divorce. Nevertheless, most contemporary reports hint at the women's independence and sexual vitality: \\"The women are described as 'fine- looking', 'buxom', 'of good appearance', 'a comely-looking country girl', or as 'enjoying the fun and frolic heartily. The selling of husbands misses the point of the sales. When a woman married the husband became legally responsible for her, so if he abandoned her, he faced imprisonment. Whereas if a woman left a man, she faced penury so if she was passed to another man, this ensured her financial security. As she was not at risk of being a burden on the local parish the practice was generally accepted. This was especially so if the woman had become involved in a new man. Many press accounts claimed that the practice was illegal, outrageous and much more, but if this was really the case, then a law would have been passed to prevent it. Crucially, there is no record of any cleric condemning it in print. When a young woman was taken before the justices at Smithfield, one of them remarked that if it were legally possible for a man tired of his wife to dispose of her at market, Smithfield would not be big enough. This suggests there were a lot of unhappy marriages at the time.Barb Drummond, Frolicksome Women & Troublesome Wives: Wife Selling in England, Barb Drummond, 2018, UK Along with other English customs, settlers arriving in the American colonies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries took with them the practice of wife selling, and the belief in its legitimacy as a way of ending a marriage. In 1645 \\"The P'ticular Court\\" of Hartford, Connecticut, reported the case of Baggett Egleston, who was fined 20 shillings for \\"bequething his wyfe to a young man\\". The Boston Evening-Post reported on 15 March 1736 an argument between two men \\"and a certain woman, each one claiming her as his Wife, but so it was that one of them had actually disposed of his Right in her to the other for Fifteen Shillings\\". The purchaser had, apparently, refused to pay in full, and had attempted to return \\"his\\" wife. He was given the outstanding sum by two generous bystanders, and paid the husband‚Äîwho promptly \\"gave the Woman a modest Salute wishing her well, and his Brother Sterling much Joy of his Bargain.\\" An account in 1781 of a William Collings of South Carolina records that he sold his wife for \\"two dollars and half [a] dozen bowls of grogg\\". Changing attitudes Towards the end of the 18th century, some hostility towards wife selling began to manifest itself amongst the general population. One sale in 1756 in Dublin was interrupted by a group of women who rescued the wife, following which the husband was given a mock trial and placed in the stocks until early the next morning. In about 1777, a wife sale in Carmarthenshire produced in the crowd \\"a great silence\\", and \\"a feeling of uneasiness in the gathering\\". When a labourer offered his wife for sale on Smithfield market in 1806, \\"the public became incensed at the husband, and would have severely punished him for his brutality, but for the interference of some officers of the police.\\" Reports of wife selling rose from two per decade in the 1750s, to a peak of fifty in the 1820s and 1830s. As the number of cases increased so did opposition to the practice. It became seen as one of a number of popular customs that the social elite believed it their duty to abolish, and women protested that it represented \\"a threat and insult to their sex\\". JPs in Quarter Sessions became more active in punishing those involved in wife selling, and some test cases in the central law courts confirmed the illegality of the practice. Newspaper accounts were often disparaging: \\"a most disgusting and disgraceful scene\\" was the description in a report of 1832, but it was not until the 1840s that the number of cases of wife selling began to decline significantly. Thompson discovered 121 published reports of wife sales between 1800 and 1840, as compared to 55 between 1840 and 1880. William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield (1705‚Äì1793), viewed wife selling as conspiracy to commit adultery. Lord Chief Justice William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, considered wife sales to be a conspiracy to commit adultery, but few of those reported in the newspapers led to prosecutions in court. The Times reported one such case in 1818, in which a man was indicted for selling his wife at Leominster market, for 2s. 6d. In 1825 a man named Johnson was charged with \\"having sung a song in the streets describing the merits of his wife, for the purpose of selling her to the highest bidder at Smithfield.\\" Such songs were not unique; in about 1842 John Ashton wrote \\"Sale of a Wife\\". The arresting officer claimed that the man had gathered a \\"crowd of all sorts of vagabonds together, who appeared to listen to his ditty, but were in fact, collected to pick pockets.\\" The defendant, however, replied that he had \\"not the most distant idea of selling his wife, who was, poor creature, at home with her hungry children, while he was endeavouring to earn a bit of bread for them by the strength of his lungs.\\" He had also printed copies of the song, and the story of a wife sale, to earn money. Before releasing him, the Lord Mayor, judging the case, cautioned Johnson that the practice could not be allowed, and must not be repeated. In 1833 the sale of a woman was reported at Epping. She was sold for 2s. 6d., with a duty of 6d. Once sober, and placed before the Justices of the Peace, the husband claimed that he had been forced into marriage by the parish authorities, and had \\"never since lived with her, and that she had lived in open adultery with the man Bradley, by whom she had been purchased\\". He was imprisoned for \\"having deserted his wife\\". A contemporary French print of an 1820 English caricature of a wife sale. The scene is set at a cattle market, which places it in the context of livestock sales and implies that the wife already has a lover, as the husband is shown apparently \\"wearing horns\\", a traditional symbol that he has been cuckolded. The return of a wife after 18 years results in Michael Henchard's downfall in Thomas Hardy's novel Mayor of Casterbridge (1886). A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her to a stranger for five guineas. He becomes a successful businessman and rises to the position of mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury. The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, Le March√© de Londres. Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: \\"They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [... They] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife exactly as he sells his horse or his dog.\\" Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20 years later; in The Book of Days (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that \\"the occasional instances of wife- sale, while remarked by ourselves with little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [who] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation.\\" Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: \\"It is a vulgar error that a husband can get rid of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate.\\" Originally published in 1869, Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer states that \\"publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an indictable offence ... And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted\\". Another form of wife selling was by deed of conveyance. Although initially much less common than sale by auction, the practice became more widespread after the 1850s, as popular opinion turned against the market sale of a wife. The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government. In 1881, Home Secretary William Harcourt was asked to comment on an incident in Sheffield, in which a man sold his wife for a quart of beer. Harcourt replied: \\"no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate\\", and \\"that no such practice as wife selling exists\\", but as late as 1889, a member of the Salvation Army sold his wife for a shilling in Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer's house, the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned. The most recent case of an English wife sale was reported in 1913, when a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court during a maintenance case claimed that her husband had sold her to one of his workmates for ¬£1 (equivalent to about ¬£ in ). The manner of her sale is unrecorded. Those involved in wife selling were often claimed to be ignorant degenerate etc. But before divorce was widely available, the solution to an unhappy marriage was a life of misery. There were several cases of men committing suicide, of women sold with the contents of the room in which they lived with their children. Voltaire is said to have claimed that the English were an ungovernable race, but the many and varied examples of wife selling show them to be on the contrary, innovative, creative and often humorous in their attempts to resolve such an impossible situation. When a young woman was taken before the justices for an attempted sale, she was told that if any couple unhappy with their marriage could resolve it in this way, Smithfield would not be big enough. This confirms how many unhappy marriages there were at the time. The problem was exacerbated by the many social changes in Britain at the time, with movement from the land to the cities, the rise of industry, and the increasing independence of the young, with alternatives to meet than the traditional parish church.Barb Drummond, Frolicksome Women Troublesome Wives: Wife Selling in England, 2018 References = Notes = =Citations= =Bibliography=         External links * Discussion and examples * Documented examples Category:Divorce in the United Kingdom Category:Women in England Category:English culture Category:Social history of England Category:17th century in England Category:18th century in England Category:19th century in England Category:20th century in England Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in England Category:Human commodity auctions ","title":"Wife selling (English custom)"},{"id":"7672461","text":"Jessica Litman and her son Ari Litman-Weinberg Jessica Litman is an American expert on copyright law and author of Digital Copyright:Protecting Intellectual Property on the Internet (2001), which traces the history of lobbying that led to the passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

The current headmaster is Mick Gee. There are 100 teachers, with approximately 32 high school teachers. Founded in 1867, Rowland Hall is the oldest school in Utah.  History  Rowland Hall traces its roots to St. Mark's School, which was founded in Salt Lake City by Episcopal Bishop Daniel Sylvester Tuttle in 1867. In support of newly established public schools in the Utah Territory, St. Mark's School was closed in the early 1890s. However its sister school, Rowland Hall, remained open. Rowland Hall has operated as a school continuously since St. Marks was founded by Bishop Tuttle in 1867. Rowland Hall opened in 1880 as a boarding school for girls from ranches in neighboring states; the school opened on the First Avenue campus in Salt Lake City. The historic building was originally a home built by George D. Watt in about 1862. and Rowland Hall is the oldest school in continuous operation in Utah, predating the establishment of public schools in the Utah territory. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the Episcopal Diocese of Utah could no longer afford to support the school, graduates and parents assumed financial responsibility and reorganized Rowland Hall as an independent school. In 1956, St. Mark's re-opened as an independent day school for boys in two historic houses and a so-called tin shed that were located next door to Rowland Hall, sharing the same city block. St. Mark's merged with Rowland Hall in 1964 to become Rowland Hall-St. Mark's, an independent coeducational school. The Middle and Upper Schools moved to the Lincoln Street Campus in 1984. The Lower and Beginning Schools moved to the McCarthey Campus on Guardsman Way in 2002. The historic campus on First Avenue was sold to the Madeleine Choir School.  Campus  Rowland Hall is currently housed on two campuses in Salt Lake City. The Beginning School and Lower School are on the McCarthey Campus, located at 720 Guardsman Way in Salt Lake City, a few blocks from the University of Utah. The Middle School and Upper School are located just over a mile away in a renovated public school building on Lincoln Street. In 2013, Rowland Hall broke ground on a new campus that will one day house all divisions: the Richard R. Steiner Campus. Soccer fields on the new campus were finished in the spring of 2014. The 13.2-acre property that will house the new campus for the Middle School, Upper School, and athletics complex is immediately adjacent to the western edge of the existing McCarthey Campus. Academics The average class size is 15 and student to teacher ratio is 10:1. 54% of faculty have advanced degrees. Faculty members have an average of 17 years teaching experience in the classroom.  Arts  Arts are taught by faculty who are professional directors, dancers, visual artists, musicians, and writers. Visual art and music are integrated throughout the curriculum. The school offers additional formal instruction and training starting in the Lower School. The Middle School and Upper School arts programs include formal dance, dramatic and musical theater, visual art, ceramics, and music opportunities through the orchestra, choral group, jazz bands, and chamber groups. Sports The Rowmark Ski Academy was founded in 1982 as part of Rowland Hall's upper school. It offers a combination of academics and complete year-round competitive ski racing program for its student-athletes, who train at Park City Mountain Resort‚Äôs 2002 Olympic Race Arena. Seventeen Rowmark athletes have been named to the U.S. Ski Team including Breezy Johnson, Alice McKennis, Andy Phillips, Erik Fisher, Keely Kelleher and Robert Saunders. Other notable Rowland Hall alumni include Hilary Lindh, Picabo Street, James \\"Gerbs\\" Bauer and Levi Leipheimer. Rowland Hall has 14 sports teams in the Upper School and six sports teams in the Middle School. Rowland Hall‚Äôs Upper School is classified as a Division 2A school in Region 17 of the Utah High School Activities Association (UHSAA). Middle School student-athletes compete in the Wasatch Athletic Conference. The school's Winged Lions have won 29 state championship titles and 64 region titles since 2007; the 2017-2018 2A Directors Cup for success in sportsmanship, academics, and state tournaments; and the annual UHSAA Sportsmanship Award. Debate Rowland Hall is recognized as a National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) School of Excellence. In the last five years, Rowland Hall Debate has produced seven State Champions, 19 National Qualifiers, and 14 Academic All-Americans, and has sent dozens of students to college on scholarships. NSDA named debate coach Mike Shackelford Utah's Educator of the Year in 2017 and Policy Debate Coach in 2014. The high school team is made up of approximately 50 debaters who participate in a variety of events, styles, and divisions, attending 10 to 12 tournaments a year and may travel all over the country. The school has a total of 13 bids to the 2015 and 2016 Tournament of Champions, 9 bids to the 2010 Tournament of Champions and 7 bids to the 2008 TOC. The RHSM top team reached quarterfinals of the 2008 and 2010 TOC, the best finish for any Utah team in the state's history. In 2015, 2 RHSM teams made it to the octafinals, making the school the only one to clear two teams at the TOC. In 2019, Rowland Hall reached the semifinals of the TOC, which is the best finish for a Utah school ever. Additionally, the team recorded the best finish ever for a Utah school at NFL Nationals, taking 3rd place in June 2009, and 2nd place in 2010. A similar record was set in the 2015 National Debate Coaches' Association Championship, which ended with RHSM taking 3rd place.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts at 1,000 watts, daytime and nighttime, from a two tower array adjacent to its studios in the Arlington section of the Town of Poughkeepsie. It uses a directional antenna in the daytime, but changes to a non-directional antenna at night, an unusual switch from standard practice where many AM stations are non-directional by day and directional at night. Weekdays begin with a local morning show, \\"Hudson Valley Focus Live with Tom Sipos.\\" The rest of the day features nationally syndicated shows, mostly from co-owned Premiere Networks, including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Mark Levin, Buck Sexton, Clyde Lewis, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal. Weekends feature shows from Kim Komando, Joe Pags, Gary Sullivan, Leo Laporte, Ric Edelman, Bill Handel, Bill Cunningham and The Jesus Christ Show. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. Most hours begin with world and national news from Fox News Radio. To supplement coverage, WKIP programming is also heard on an FM translator station on 98.5 MHz. History =Early Years= Originally owned by Poughkeepsie Newspaper Incorporated, WKIP signed on the air on June 6, 1940, with 250 watts of power at 1420 kilocycles.Broadcasting Yearbook 1941 page 60 It was the first radio station in Dutchess County since the move of WOKO from Beacon to Albany a decade earlier. Like many other \\"local\\" frequency stations, the Federal Communications Commission had it move to a new frequency in 1941, after the NARBA treaty and realignment, 1450 kHz. WKIP began as an NBC Blue Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio. In 1945, the Blue Network became today's ABC Radio Network. WKIP's involvement with ABC would last for the remainder of the 20th Century. With the shift of network programming from AM to TV, WKIP evolved into a full service Middle of the Road and news format in the 1950s, a time where WKIP also added FM coverage when it purchased the former WHVS at 104.7 MHz in 1958. Rechristened WKIP-FM, the station was sold a decade later and is now WSPK. =Top 40 Era= WKIP maintained its original format and ownership until late 1967 when the station was sold to Star Broadcasting, which changed the format the next year to Top 40. Around the same time, the ABC Radio Network switched to four sub- networks. WKIP signed up with the Top 40-leaning American Contemporary Network feed. The station was not successful with its new format against competitor 950 WHVW and that October returned to its prior MOR format. In 1970, WKIP was sold again, this time to Olympian Broadcasting (to whom Star had sold WKIP-FM to two years earlier and who would resell that station to WBNR owner Lance Broadcasting). Modifying the format to full service adult contemporary, WKIP rose from being in last place to first place with a combination of increased local involvement and help from format changes at WHVW and WEOK, until the mid-1980s. =Switch to Talk= When Richard Novick purchased WKIP from Olympian in 1987, assorted changes started to take place starting with Novick allowing veteran morning host Van Risthie to leave for WHVW. This move plus the imminent decline of full-service AM formats led WKIP to go through a short-lived Fun and Games (hybrid oldies/talk) format with the station going to a talk radio format in 1989. At that time, Novick launched FM station 92.1 WRNQ, which had the spirit of WKIP's former format, as well as Van Risthie. WRNQ was an automated station. The talk radio format would last for the entire 1990s, surviving a simulcast attempt with the Novick-controlled 96.9 MHz which also sported the WKIP-FM calls. After Straus Media purchased Novick's stations in November 1996, elements of WKIP's programming began to be heard on sister stations in Ellenville, Hudson, and Catskill. =Adult Standards= WKIP and all of Straus's stations were sold to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in June 2000 with Clear Channel taking control of the stations that October. With the ownership change came a new format, the \\"Music of Your Life\\" adult standards format, as part of the Hudson Valley Nostalgia Network (a simulcast, minus commercials, with WELV in Ellenville, WGHQ in Kingston, and WHUC in Hudson). =Return to Talk= The \\"Nostalgia Network\\" was dismantled in 2004 with WKIP keeping the standards format for three more years. Then in October 2007, the station returned to talk radio programming, carrying mostly shows from iHeart's Premiere Radio Networks. On June 10, 2008 WKIP dropped Quinn and Rose and began running the syndicated Don Imus morning show until October 1, 2012 when he was replaced by Hudson Valley Focus Live with Tom Sipos.

Consisting of nearly three thousand students, faculty, and staff,https://www.ics.uci.edu/about/about_factsfigures.php the school maintains three buildings in the South-East section of UCI's undergraduate campus, and maintains student body and research affiliations throughout UCI. The school of ICS consists of three departments: Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics. The combined groupings focus the school around the fields of computing and processing of information. The departments confer eight undergraduate, eleven masters, and seven doctoral degrees in total, with some degree programs cooperating with affiliated schools.  History  Beginning in 1968, three years after UCI's founding, the Department of Information and Computer Science was created as an independent department, not belonging to any school. In 2002, the 35-year-old department was elevated to the status of a school, and its faculty were partitioned into two departments, the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Informatics. The Department of Statistics, founded earlier in 2002, was included as a third department in the newly created school.http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/ During 2004, the school received a $20 million anonymous donation. The donation was later revealed to be from Donald Bren, a wealthy real estate developer and head of the Irvine Company. The school was renamed in his honor. The donation is primarily being used to seek out and seed prestigious researchers.http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/bren/  Academics  The school of ICS is one of less than fifty independent computer science schools in the United States, and the only one in the University of California system. The US News and World Report ranks Bren School as 29th in the United States for Computer Science ,http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best- colleges/university-of-california-irvine-110653/overall-rankings and 14th in public university programs. Among some ICS subareas, the school is ranked 4th in human-computer interaction, 9th in software engineering, and 8th in databases. =Undergraduate= The school possesses 8 undergraduate majors, ranging from lower level hardware to high level social computing, each providing a bachelor of science degree (notably, Computer Engineering is not part of ICS, and resides in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering). Out of the 8 undergraduate majors in the Donald Bren School, 3 are unique interdisciplinary studies shared between the Paul Merage School of Business, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the School of Biological Sciences. The majors that are available include Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science & Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer Science, and Software Engineering. Non-interdisciplinary majors are: *The school's primary major is Information and Computer Science, focused on computer science theory and software engineering. In contrast to engineering majors, additional natural sciences (such as physics) are not required to complete the major. Two upper division theoretical mathematics courses are required, along with basic calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and discrete mathematics. The program allows students more freedom to pursue a selected field in computer science. Though not required for a degree, the school certifies specializations within the major: **Artificial Intelligence **Computer Systems **Implementation and Analysis of Algorithms **Information Systems **Networks and Distributed Systems **Software Systems * The second most popular major within the school is Computer Science, similar in composition to ICS. Though more limiting in electives, the major was formed around the recommended courses set by ACM and IEEE, and features a more classical computer science curriculum.Bren School, Undergraduate degrees, 12 March 2012. URL accessed June 8, 2011. * Informatics, a major unique in the UC system. The higher level of social abstraction prepares students in such fields as software analysis, management, design, and interfaces. Undergraduate interdisciplinary majors are: * Computer Science and Engineering - hosted jointly by The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.UC Irvine, Undergraduate Major in Computer Science and Engineering, 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006. * Business Information Management (BIM) is administered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences as an interdisciplinary degree program with The Paul Merage School of Business. * Biomedical Computing (BMC) = Graduate = ICS provides 11 master's level and 7 doctorate level graduate programs. Since computing is a part of many other fields (which use or interact with computing technology), ICS collaborates with other schools in many of its programs.Bren School, Graduate Studies, Information on all the degrees offered by the school, 20 October 2006. URL accessed December 14, 2006. The Department of Computer Science offers a general major to those who have no specialized field, and is awarded as Information and Computer Science (M.S.). Computer Science (M.S.,Ph.D.) allows for a wide range of fields, similar to the general degree; however, doctoral degrees require a particular research interest within the field, unlike the general degree. Embedded Systems (M.S.) more narrowly focuses students on the implementation of specialized computer systems. Knowledge Discovery and Data (M.S.) applies to informatics fields like information processing and to computer science fields such as artificial intelligence. The Department of Informatics offers its own general degree Informatics Track in General Informatics (M.S.,Ph.D.), however doctoral candidates must have a specific research interest. Informatics Track in Interactive and Collaborative Technology (M.S.,Ph.D.) narrows its general degree to the field of human‚Äìcomputer interaction, with end parties as wholly human or man and machine. Software engineering is researched under the Informatics Track in Software (M.S.,Ph.D.) degree, as software development processes are directly related to human interaction and information systems. Three multi-discipline fields exist, spread across more than one school. Networked Systems (M.S.,Ph.D.) involves both the School of Engineering and the school of ICS. The research area covers high and low levels of telecommunications and computer networks. Arts Computation Engineering (M.S.), as its name suggests, covers both the School of Engineering and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts in addition to ICS. The field relies heavily on high level informatics principles, applying science to the arts. Informatics in Biology & Medicine (M.S.,Ph.D.), requires classes within the wide fields of Biology. Research may range from microscopic systems, such as proteins, or macro-level systems, such as populations. Though the Department of Statistics currently has no undergraduate degrees, it offers one graduate program: Statistics (M.S.,Ph.D.). The graduate program may help model many different problems, and is highly applicable to researchers in other fields such as economics and biology.

However, this belief has never been proven to be the case and therefore is only considered to be a possibility. His date of birth and death are unknown. According to historical documents, the daimy≈ç Uesugi Kenshin had heard of Danz≈ç's reputation, which had led for him to invite Danz≈ç to his prime castle. Kenshin decided to test Danz≈ç's abilities by challenging him to sneak into a certain castle and to retrieve a prized naginata (a sword in another version of this story) from one of his retainers, Naoe Kanetsugu. Danz≈ç infiltrated Kanetsugu's heavily guarded castle and not only succeeding in stealing the naginata, but also captured a young servant girl. Kenshin then realized that Danz≈ç would be a very useful ally and took him into his service. However, Kanetsugu plotted to kill Danz≈ç (according to another version it was Kenshin himself who ordered his death, perceiving him to be too skillful and thus dangerous), forcing him to try to defect to Takeda Shingen, Kenshin's rival. Suspecting Danz≈ç to be a double agent, Shingen however ordered him to be killed.Joel Levy, Ninja: The Shadow Warrior, pp. 171‚Äì172 Danz≈ç was captured by Takeda's men and executed through decapitation.

The largest Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac diaspora is located in Metropolitan Detroit, with a figure of 150,000. High concentrations are also located in Chicago, Phoenix, San Jose, Modesto, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Turlock, among others. The first large wave of Assyrian immigration to the United States was due to the Assyrian genocide, which occurred 1914‚Äì1920. History =Early history= Assyrians have been present in the United States since the late 19th century. The first recorded Assyrian in America was Zia Attala. He reportedly immigrated to Philadelphia in 1889 and found work in the hotel industry. Most early Assyrian immigrants, however, were young men sent by Western missionaries for religious training. =Second wave of immigration= Following the turn of the century, Assyrian immigration to America mostly came to a halt due to the Immigration Act of 1924 which effectively cut off any legal immigration to the United States for Assyrians and other non-Western European groups. The second large wave of immigration occurred in the 1960s and 70s, mainly from northern Iraq due to conflicts and persecution by the Baathist government of Iraq. Many Assyrians arrived during this period and took advantage of the ongoing White flight in Detroit. As a result of the situation, Assyrians gained a monopoly over grocery stores and other small businesses, and in many cases used their finances and newfound wealth to benefit the Assyrian community there and take in Assyrian refugees from Iraq. More Assyrians arrived throughout the 80s and 90s for similar reasons, with newer residents moving out of Detroit into suburbs such as Royal Oak and Sterling Heights due to the Crack epidemic in Detroit, while others began to move to San Diego, establishing a new Assyrian community there. In 2005, the first Assyrian school in the United States, the Assyrian American Christian School, opened in Tarzana, Los Angeles. =In Michigan= Chaldean Catholic Church in Detroit. Assyrian Catholic immigration, mainly to Detroit, Michigan, began in the early 20th century. Assyrian immigration to the cities in Michigan began in the early 20th century. The cities in the state include, but are not limited to, Detroit, Southfield, Sterling Heights, Oak Park, Troy, West Bloomfield, Commerce, Walled Lake, Rochester Hills, Farmington Hills, Ferndale, Warren, Bloomfield Hills and Ann Arbor. More and more Assyrians, as they establish themselves financially, quickly move out of Detroit and into the other locations, including San Diego and cities in Arizona. Before the 1970s, Assyrians came to the United States in search of greater economic opportunities. After the 1970s, many Assyrians fled for political freedom, especially after the rise of Saddam Hussein and, after the Persian Gulf War. Some were drawn by the economic opportunities they had seen successfully affect their family members who had already immigrated. Less stringent immigration laws during the 1960s and 1970s facilitated increasing numbers, with the 1970s seeing the highest number of Assyrians coming to the United States. In 1962, the number of Assyrian owned grocery stores was 120, but grew to 278 in 1972. The main cause of this were the 1967 Detroit riots, after which Jewish grocery store owners left the area and left the opportunity open for Assyrians to take over. Often these Jews sold their old stores to Assyrians.Chafets, Ze'ev. Devils Night: and Other True Tales of Detroit. New York: Random House, 1990 Iraqi president Saddam Hussein donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Chaldean Catholic churches in Detroit and received a key to the city in the 1980s on behalf of mayor Coleman Young, when the Baath regime was an ally of the United States government. Mostly all new Assyrian Chaldean Catholic immigrants and low- income senior citizens tend to reside in Detroit, in the 7 Mile Road between Woodward Avenue and John R Street. This area was officially named Chaldean Town in 1999. There are eight Chaldean Catholic churches in Metropolitan Detroit, located in West Bloomfield, Troy (where there are two), Oak Park, Southfield, Warren, Sterling Heights and Detroit. =In California= After World War II, several Assyrian men who had been educated in Iraq by American Jesuits traveled to the United States. They were to teach Arabic to U.S. officers at the Army Language School who were going to be stationed in the Middle East. The men started the San Diego-area Chaldean Catholic community. Yasmeen S. Hanoosh, author of The Politics of Minority Chaldeans Between Iraq and America, wrote that the Chaldean Catholic Church in San Diego \\"continued to grow in relative isolation from the family-chain-migration based communities in and around Michigan.\\"Hanoosh, p. 195. =In Illinois= Rev. Peter Elia from Iran was the first priest of the Chaldean Catholic community in Chicago which originated in 1907. In 1912, the St. Ephrem Chaldean Parish of Chicago was formed by Rev. Warda Mirza, also from Iran. Geographic distribution According to the 2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates there are 110,807 Assyrian people in the United States. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 82,355 Assyrians/Chaldeans/Syriacs in the country, of whom most lived in Illinois.

(c1986) Danbury, Conn.: GrolierFrye, R. N. (October 1992). \\"Assyria and Syria: Synonyms\\" (PDF). Journal of Near Eastern Studies 51 (4): 281‚Äì285. doi:10.1086/373570. and historically meant Assyrian (see Etymology of Syria). In addition, the Syrian Arab Republic is home to many ethnicities, including Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians, Kurds, and Turcomans, and is thus not an exclusively Arab nation. The Syriac Orthodox Church was previously known as the Syrian Orthodox Church until a Holy Synod in 2000 voted to change it to Syriac, thus distinguishing from the Arabs. Mor Cyril Aphrem Karim wrote a letter to the Syriacs in 2000 urging them to register in the census as Syriac with a C, and not Syrian with an N to distinguish the group. He also urged them not to register as the country of origin. Chaldean refers to ethnic Assyrians who are (traditionally) Roman Catholic, having split from the Assyrian Church between the 17th and 19th centuries. On the U.S. census, there is a section for the Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriacs, which is listed separately from Syrian, Syrian being a subcategory for Arab.

She was also a teacher whose studio was important to the careers of a generation of artists who would become nationally known. She worked for equal rights for African Americans in the arts. Early life and work Augusta Christine Fells was born in Green Cove Springs (near Jacksonville), Florida on February 29, 1892, to Edward Fells, a Methodist minister, and Cornelia Murphy. Augusta began making figures as a child, mostly small animals out of the natural red clay of her hometown, Green Cove Springs Florida. Her father was a poor Methodist minister who strongly opposed his daughter's early interest in art. \\"My father licked me four or five times a week,‚Äù Savage once recalled, ‚Äúand almost whipped all the art out of me.‚Äù This was because at that time, he believed her sculpture to be a sinful practice, based upon his interpretation of the \\"graven images\\" portion of the Bible. She persevered, and the principal of her new high school in West Palm Beach, where her family relocated in 1915, encouraged her talent and allowed her to teach a clay modeling class.Heller, Nancy G., Women Artists: An Illustrated History, Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 This began a lifelong commitment to teaching as well as to creating art. Augusta Savage with sculpture, 1938 In 1907 Augusta Fells married John T. Moore. Her only child, Irene Connie Moore, was born the following year. John died shortly thereafter. In 1915, she married James Savage;Florida State Division of Cultural Affairs http://dos.myflorida.com/cultural/programs/florida-artists-hall-of- fame/augusta-savage/1920 US Census, taken January 17‚Äì19, for 916 Banyan Street, West Palm Beach, Florida: James Savage, 25, born Florida, occupation Chauffeur for Private Family; Augusta Savage, 27, born Florida, occupation Laundress for Private Family; Irene Moore, 12.

After their divorce in the early 1920s, Augusta Savage moved back to West Palm Beach. Savage continued to model clay, and in 1919 was granted a booth at the Palm Beach County Fair where she was awarded a $25 prize and ribbon for most original exhibit. Following this success, she sought commissions for work in Jacksonville, Florida, before departing for New York City in 1921. She arrived with a letter of recommendation from the Palm Beach County Fair official George Graham Currie for sculptor Solon Borglum and $4.60. When Borglum discovered that she could not afford tuition at the School of American Sculpture, he encouraged her to apply to Cooper Union, a scholarship-based school, in New York City where she was admitted in October 1921. She was selected before 142 other men on the waiting list. Her talent and ability so impressed the Cooper Union Advisory Council that she was awarded additional funds for room and board when she lost the financial support of her job as an apartment caretaker. From 1921 through 1923, she studied under sculptor George Brewster. She completed the four-year degree course in three years.Augusta Savage. By: Kalfatovic, Martin R., American National Biography (from Oxford University Press), 2010 In 1923 Savage applied for a Summer art program sponsored by the French government; although being more than qualified, she was turned down by the international judging committee solely because they refused to award a spot to a Black person.Bearden & Henderson, AHOAA, p. 169‚Äì170 Savage was deeply upset and questioned the committee, beginning the first of many public fights for equal rights in her life. Though appeals were made to the French government to reinstate the award, they had no effect and Savage was unable to study at the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts. The incident got press coverage on both sides of the Atlantic, and eventually, the sole supportive committee member sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil ‚Äì who at one time had shared a studio with Henry Ossawa Tanner ‚Äì invited her to study with him. She later cited him as one of her teachers. After completing studies at Cooper Union, Savage worked in Manhattan steam laundries to support herself and her family. Her father had been paralyzed by a stroke, and the family's home destroyed by a hurricane. Her family from Florida moved into her small West 137th Street apartment. During this time she obtained her first commission for a bust of W. E. B. Du Bois for the Harlem Library. Her outstanding sculpture brought more commissions, including one for a bust of Marcus Garvey. Her bust of William Pickens Sr., a key figure in the NAACP, earned praise for depicting an African American in a more humane, neutral way as opposed to stereotypes of the time, as did many of her works. In 1923 Savage married Robert Lincoln Poston, a prot√©g√© of Garvey.Ancestry.com shows Florida Divorce Index dated 1941 for James Savage from Augusta, in Palm Beach County. Poston died of pneumonia aboard a ship while returning from Liberia as part of a Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League delegation in 1924. In 1925 Savage won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. This scholarship covered only tuition, and she was not able to raise money for travel and living expenses. Thus, she was unable to attend. In the 1920s writer and eccentric Joe Gould became infatuated with Savage. He wrote her \\"endless letters,\\" telephoned her constantly, and wanted to marry her. Eventually, this turned to harassment.Lepore, Jill, \\"Joe Gould's Teeth: The long-lost story of the longest book ever written\\". The New Yorker, 07-27-2015 Savage won the Otto Kahn Prize in a 1928 exhibition at The Harmon Foundation with her submission Head of a Negro. Yet, she was an outspoken critic of the fetishization of the \\"negro primitive\\" aesthetic favored by white patrons at the time. She publicly critiqued the director of The Harmon Foundation, Mary Beattie Brady, for her low standards for Black art and lack of understanding in the area of visual arts in general. In 1929 with pooled resources from the Urban League, Rosenwald Foundation, a Carnegie Foundation grant, and donations from friends and former teachers, Savage was able to travel to France when she was 37. She lived on Montparnasse and worked in the studio of M. [F√©lix] Benneteau [-Desgrois]. While the studio was initially encouraging of her work, Savage later wrote that \\"...the masters are not in sympathy as they all have their own definite ideas and usually wish their pupils to follow their particular method...\\" and began primarily working on her own in 1930. Knowledge of Savage's talent and struggles became widespread in the African-American community; fundraising parties were held in Harlem and Greenwich Village, and African-American women's groups and teachers from Florida A&M; all sent her money for studies abroad. In 1929, with assistance as well from the Julius Rosenwald Fund, Savage enrolled and attended the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, a leading Paris art school. In Paris, she studied with the sculptor Charles Despiau. She exhibited and won awards in two Paris Salons and one Exposition. She toured France, Belgium, and Germany, researching sculpture in cathedrals and museums. Later work Savage returned to the United States in 1931, energized from her studies and achievements. The Great Depression had almost stopped art sales. She pushed on, and in 1934 became the first African- American artist to be elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. She then launched the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts, located in a basement on West 143rd Street in Harlem. She opened her studio to anyone who wanted to paint, draw, or sculpt. Her many young students included the future nationally known artists Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis, and Gwendolyn Knight. Another student was the sociologist Kenneth B. Clark whose later research contributed to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education that ruled school segregation unconstitutional. Her school evolved into the Harlem Community Art Center; 1500 people of all ages and abilities participated in her workshops, learning from her multi-cultural staff, and showing work around New York City. Funds from the Works Progress Administration helped, but old struggles of discrimination were revived between Savage and WPA officials who objected to her having a leadership role.AHOAAA p. 174. Savage was one of four women and only two African Americans to receive a professional commission from the Board of Design of the 1939 New York World's Fair. She created Lift Every Voice and Sing (also known as \\"The Harp\\"), inspired by the song by James Weldon and Rosamond Johnson. The 16-foot-tall plaster sculpture was the most popular and most photographed work at the fair; small metal souvenir copies were sold, and many postcards of the piece were purchased. The work reinterpreted the musical instrument to feature 12 singing African-American youth in graduated heights as its strings, with the harp's sounding board transformed into an arm and a hand. In the front, a kneeling young man offered music in his hands. Savage did not have funds to have it cast in bronze or to move and store it. Like other temporary installations, the sculpture was destroyed at the close of the fair. Augusta Savage working on a sculpture Savage opened two galleries whose shows were well attended and well reviewed, but few sales resulted and the galleries closed. The last major showing of her work occurred in 1939. Deeply depressed by her financial struggle, in the 1940s Savage moved to a farmhouse in Saugerties, New York. While in Saugerties, she established close ties with her neighbors and welcomed family and friends from New York City to her rural home. Savage cultivated a garden and sold pigeons, chickens, and eggs. The K-B Products Corporation, the world's largest growers of mushrooms at that time, employed Savage as a laboratory assistant in the company's cancer research facility. She acquired a car and learned to drive to enable her commute. Herman K. Knaust, director of the laboratory, encouraged Savage to pursue her artistic career and provided her with art supplies. Savage created and taught art and sculpted friends and neighbors. Her last commissioned work was for Knaust and was that of the American journalist and author Poultney Bigelow, whose father, John, was U.S. Minister to France during the Civil War. Her few neighbors said that she was always making something with her hands.AHOAAA, p. 179. Much of her work is in clay or plaster, as she could not often afford bronze. One of her most famous busts is titled Gamin which is on permanent display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.; a life- sized version is in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art. At the time of its creation, Gamin, which is modeled after a Harlem youth, was voted most popular in an exhibition of over 200 works by black artists. Her style can be described as realistic, expressive, and sensitive. Though her art and influence within the art community are documented, the location of much of her work is unknown. In 1945 Savage moved to Saugerties, New York. She taught art to children and wrote children's stories. Savage died of cancer on March 26, 1962, in New York City. While she was all but forgotten at the time of her death, Savage is remembered today as a great artist, activist, and arts educator; serving as an inspiration to the many that she taught, helped, and encouraged. Legacy The Augusta Fells Savage Institute of Visual Arts, a Baltimore, Maryland public high school, is named in her honor. In 2001 her home and studio in Saugerties, New York were listed on the New York State and National Register of Historic Places as the Augusta Savage House and Studio. It is the most significant surviving site associated with the productive life of this renowned artist, teacher, and activist. Her home has been restored to evoke the period when she lived there, and serves to interpret her life and creative vision. In 2007 the City of Green Cove Springs, Florida nominated her to the Florida Artist Hall of Fame; she was inducted the Spring of 2008. Today at the actual location of her birth, there is a Community Center named in her honor. A biography of Augusta Savage intended for younger readers has been written by Alan Schroeder. In Her Hands: The Story of Sculptor Augusta Savage was released in September 2009 by Lee and Low, a New York publishing company. The papers of Augusta Savage are available at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at New York Public Library.  Works  * Busts of W.E.B.

Lancefield is a town in the Shire of Macedon Ranges local government area in Victoria, Australia north of the state capital, Melbourne and had a population of 2,357 at the 2011 census. History The area was used by the indigenous aboriginal people as a quarry site for the manufacture of stone axes and was first settled by European squatters in 1837. The main source of these stone tools was at Mount William, to the north east of Lancefield. A Lancefield Post Office opened on 16 January 1858 in the Romsey/Five Mile Creek area, to the south. In 1860 this was renamed Five Mile Creek when Lancefield Post Office opened in the present township. Lancefield's elevation and climate made it a popular summer resort in the 1880s. In recent years, many local wineries have been established in the area. The town has a connection to the Kelly Gang; for it was here that Constable Fitzpatrick, the instigator of the Kelly Outbreak in 1878 was finally found by the Victorian police to be no good and for his actions was finally discharged from the force.Victorian Parliamentary Papers, 1881 & 1883, 'Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria'Cf. J.J. Kenneally, Inner History of the Kelly Gang, 1929 plus all subsequent editions, Ch II [2] Lancefield district had a reputation for some of the best fertile soils in Victoria. Prior to being cut up into small blocks during the early 1970s the region produced high yields per acre of potatoes, fat lambs, fat cattle, wheat and other cereal crops. A large fossil deposit from the Pleistocene epoch was discovered at Lancefield Swamp, containing the remains of many species of extinct megafauna, including ; Macropus titan, a giant kangaroo; Diprotodon, a rhinoceros-sized wombat; and Genyornis, a giant flightless bird. The local Australian rules football team, Lancefield Football Club competes in the Riddell District Football League. Golfers play at the course of the Lancefield Golf Club on Heddle Road. Burke and Wills The Burke and Wills expedition camped at Lancefield on their journey to cross Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. They arrived here on 23 August 1860 and made their fourth camp out of Melbourne. A marker at the site of the original town at Mustey's Bridge on Deep Creek commemorates the site of their camp. The route of their departure northwards from the town is commemorated by the road to Mia Mia, which was named 'Burke and Wills Track' in their honour. Railway The former Lancefield railway station A railway branch line off the Melbourne-Bendigo line originated at Clarkefield (known then as Lancefield Junction), opening as far as Lancefield on 6 June 1881. This section of the line was closed on 13 August 1956. By 6 April 1892, the line was extended out of Lancefield to Kilmore.The Heathcote Junction to Bendigo and Associated Railways, Turton, Keith Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, April 1970 pp69‚Äì88 However, this section of the line was so unsuccessful that it was closed on 1 June 1897.Some Notes on the Lancefield- Kilmore Section, Poole, L.G.

Witton of the Bushveldt Carbineers was charged along with Breaker Morant and Peter Handcock of murdering captured Boers during the Anglo-Boer War. Witton was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be shot, but this was commuted to life of penal servitude. Morant and Handcock both found guilty and sentenced to be shot were executed in Pretoria on 27 February 1902. Witton (who had never been to England) was sent to England and held in prison until released due to public pressure from Australia. It was to Lancefield that he came in broken health on his return to Australia and wrote his angry book, Scapegoats of the Empire (1907). In the introduction to his book that he stated he was living in Lancefield. When due for publication a fire destroyed all but several copies of the book. In 1982, Angus and Robertson in the United Kingdom re-published the book following the success of the movie Breaker Morant. George Witton's cousin, Cecily Adams of Castlecrag Sydney, owned the copyright for \\"Scapegoats of the Empire\\" following George's death. Cecily was also aware of some additional documentation written by George Witton, which he asked not to be released until after his death. Cecily was determined a further edition, which included this additional material, should be published and in 1989 an edition was published by ADLIB BOOKS of Bath, by arrangement with Cecily Adams as the copyright owner and Angus & Robertson (UK).

The western terminus of the highway begins east of the Little Traverse Bay of Lake Michigan and ends a few blocks from Lake Huron in Rogers City. M-68 skirts just south of Indian River and Burt Lake. The first incarnation of M-68 existed in the Upper Peninsula before being absorbed into M-35. The current designation was created in 1936. A segment of highway once used by US Highway 23 (US 23) was incorporated into the trunkline as a discontinuous section in the early 1940s until it was later connected in 1946. Route description M-68 starts in the community of Alanson east of Little Traverse Bay in Emmet County. US 31 runs along Burr Avenue parallel to the former Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad line and depot in town. M-68 starts at an intersection between Chicago Street and Burr Avenue. The trunkline runs southeasterly from this intersection and on a bridge over the Crooked River. After leaving town, the highway curves to run due east through hilly terrain. After crossing the Cheboygan County line, the roadway meets the community of Burt Lake. It curves southeasterly along the shoreline of the lake of the same name. The roadway rounds the south end of Burt Lake and approaches the community of Indian River. South of Burt Lake State Park, the trunkline meets Straits Highway, the former routing of US 27 through Indian River. M-68 turns north along Straits Highway through downtown and then turns east toward Interstate 75 (I-75). It is along this section of M-68 that the roadway crosses the Sturgeon River. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measured the highest annual average daily traffic (AADT) figures for M-68 along the section of highway west of Indian River. AADT is a measure of the average number of vehicles using a segment of roadway on any given day of the year, and for 2007, MDOT measured it at 9,200 vehicles daily. After crossing I-75 at exit 310, M-68 heads southeasterly, parallel to the Crumley Creek, out of town. The roadway continues through hilly terrain and crosses the Pigeon River on the route to Afton. M-68 merges with M-33 east of Afton. M-33 curves from the north toward the east. There is a small connector in this intersection to allow southbound M-33 traffic to turn west along M-68 instead of merging into the combined eastbound M-33/M-68 traffic. The two highways continue together in a concurrency through the wooded, hilly terrain to the unincorporated community of Tower, where they cross the Black River. It is east of this river crossing where the highway meets the southern end of F-05, a County-Designated Highway that runs along Black River Road. M-33/M-68 cross into Presque Isle County just west of Onaway. M-68 turns northwest along Washington Avenue, and M-33 turns south along Michigan Street. M-68 turns east on State Street through downtown and runs out of town to cross the Rainy River in rural Presque Isle County. East of the Ocqueoc River crossing, M-68 turns north along Millersburg Road. The highway later curves back to the east near Ocqueoc Falls Highway, home of a bridge that carried the highway before 1954. M-68 continues to follow Hutchinson Road eastward over the Little Ocqueoc River and on to the Rogers City area. This section of highway had the lowest AADT levels in 2007 at 1,400 vehicles daily. The highway turns northeasterly after intersecting Airport Highway on the outskirts of town. Renamed as Erie Street, M-68 meets US 23 southwest of downtown. The highway continues along Erie Street until meeting Bus. US 23, which runs along Third Street. This intersection marks the end of M-68, four blocks from Lake Huron, from its start in Alanson. History =Previous incarnation= The first highway to bear the M-68 designation was located in the western Upper Peninsula. It ran north from Rockland to Ontonagon and then westerly toward Silver City in 1919. This roadway was redesignated by 1927 as a segment of M-35. =Current incarnation= M-68 was designated along a segment of its current roadway in 1936. The roadway connecting Alanson and Indian River was given the M-68 designation, while US 23 was routed between Rogers City and Afton. When US 23 was moved to its current lakeshore routing between Rogers City and Cheboygan in 1940, M-33 was extended westerly from Onaway to Afton and north to Cheboygan over the former US 23 roadway. The Afton‚ÄìOnaway segment of M-33 and the remainder of the former US 23 east of Onaway was designated as a second segment of M-68 as well. The gap between these two segments was eliminated by July 1946. Two realignments were made to the highways routing. The first bypassed a bridge over the Ocqueoc River in Presque Isle County in 1954. This bridge was built in 1920 at a cost of $8,849 (equivalent to $ in ) in the filled spandrel arch style. A second change in the routing between 1961 and 1962 moved the trunkline to a more direct connection between Indian River and Afton. This change also bypassed the last remaining gravel section of the highway.

Today, he is most often associated with the Language poets. Life and work Alan Davies was born in Lacombe, a town in central Alberta, Canada. By the mid-1970s, he was editing a poetry journal, Occulist Witnesses, in the Boston area where he had stayed for a few years after attending Robert Creeley's poetry class at Harvard Summer School in 1972. By this time he had hand-published John Wieners' treatise on and for young poets, \\"The Lanterns along the Wall,\\" which Wieners had written especially for Creeley's class.http://jacketmagazine.com/21/kimb-rev1.html John and the Four Dunn(e)s and began more actively publishing his own poetry. Soon, Davies was forming relations with an experimental group of writers whose practice became determining features of what grew into the Language School. This 'school' was not a group precisely, but a tendency in the work of many of its so-called practitioners. Davies edited A Hundred Posters, one of the important \\"little\\" magazines of the \\"Language\\" movement. Subsequently, Davies was included in the crucial anthology devoted to \\"language-centred\\" writing: In the American Tree, edited by Ron Silliman (National Poetry Foundation, 1986; 2002).

He was known for cutting out middlemen in the drug trade and buying heroin directly from his source in the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia. Lucas boasted that he smuggled heroin using the coffins of dead American servicemen,\\"The Return of Superfly\\" New York, 14 August 2000. but this claim is denied by his Southeast Asian associate, Leslie \\"Ike\\" Atkinson. Rather than hide the drugs in the coffins, they were hidden in the pallets underneath, as depicted in the feature film American Gangster (2007) in which he was played by Denzel Washington, although the film fictionalized elements of Lucas' life for dramatic effect. In 1976, Lucas was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 70 years in prison; however, after becoming an informant, his sentence was reduced to five years. He was convicted of the same offense in 1984, and sentenced to seven years in prison. He died in 2019. Early life Lucas was born in La Grange, North Carolina, and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina.\\"Frank Lucas, Between Issues\\" Metro Magazine, 8 November 2007. He was the son of Mahalee (n√©e Jones; 1909-2003) and Fred Lucas.https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VHRJ-WD8 accessed 8/11/14 He said that the incident that sparked his motivation to embark on a life of crime was having witnessed his 12-year-old cousin's murder at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan, for apparently \\"reckless eyeballing\\" (looking at) a Caucasian woman, in Greensboro. He drifted through a life of petty crime until one occasion when, after a fight with a former employer, with whose daughter he had been having. In the ensuing fight, Lucas hit the father on the head with a pipe, knocking him unconscious. He then stole $400 from the company till and set the establishment on fire, and then fled to New York City at the behest of his mother, who feared that he would either be imprisoned for life or lynched. Once in Harlem, he quickly began indulging in petty crime and pool hustling before he was taken under the wing of gangster Bumpy Johnson. Lucas' connection to Johnson has since come under some doubt; he claimed to have been Johnson's driver for 15 years, although Johnson spent just five years out of prison before his death in 1968. According to Johnson's widow, much of the narrative that Lucas claimed as his actually belonged to another young hustler named Zach Walker, who lived with Johnson and his family and later betrayed him. Criminal career After Johnson's death, Lucas traveled around and came to the realization that, to be successful, he would have to break the monopoly that the Italian Mafia held in New York. Traveling to Bangkok, Thailand, he eventually made his way to Jack's American Star Bar, an R&R; hangout for black soldiers. It was here that he met former U.S. Army sergeant Leslie \\"Ike\\" Atkinson, who was from Goldsboro, North Carolina and married to one of Lucas' cousins. Lucas is quoted as saying, \\"Ike knew everyone over there, every black guy in the Army, from the cooks on up.\\" When interviewed for a New York magazine article published in 2000, Lucas denied putting the drugs among the corpses of American soldiers. Instead he flew with a North Carolina carpenter to Bangkok and: Lucas' January 1975 federal mug shot However, Atkinson, nicknamed \\"Sergeant Smack\\" by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),Chepesiuk, Ron (January 17, 2008). \\"New Criminologist Special - Frank Lucas, 'American Gangster,' and the Truth Behind the Asian Connection\\" . has said he shipped drugs in furniture, not caskets. Whatever method he used, Lucas smuggled the drugs into the United States with this direct link from Asia. Lucas said that he made US$1 million per day selling drugs on 116th Street though this was later discovered to be an exaggeration. Federal judge Sterling Johnson, who was the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York at the time of Lucas' crimes, called Lucas' operation \\"one of the most outrageous international dope-smuggling gangs ever, an innovator who got his own connections outside the U.S. and then sold the narcotics himself in the street.\\" In an interview, Lucas said, \\"I wanted to be rich. I wanted to be Donald Trump rich, and so help me God, I made it.\\" Lucas only trusted relatives and close friends from North Carolina to handle his various heroin operations. Lucas thought they were less likely to steal from him and be tempted by various vices in the big city. He stated his heroin, \\"Blue Magic\\", was 98‚Äì100% pure when shipped from Thailand. Lucas has been quoted as saying that his worth was \\"something like $52 million\\", most of it in Cayman Islands banks. Added to this is \\"maybe 1,000 keys (kilograms), (2,200 pounds), of dope on hand\\" with a potential profit of no less than $300,000 per kilo (per 2.2 lb). This huge profit margin allowed him to buy property all over the country, including office buildings in Detroit, and apartments in Los Angeles and Miami. He also bought a several-thousand-acre ranch in North Carolina on which he ranged 300 head of Black Angus cattle, including a breeding bull worth $125,000. Lucas rubbed shoulders with the elite of the entertainment, politics, and crime worlds, stating later that he had met Howard Hughes at one of Harlem's best clubs in his day. Though he owned several mink and chinchilla coats and other accessories, Lucas much preferred to dress casually and corporately so as not to attract attention to himself. When he was arrested in the mid-1970s, all of Lucas' assets were seized. Arrests and releases In January 1975, Lucas' house in Teaneck, New Jersey, was raided by a task force consisting of 10 agents from Group 22 of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and 10 New York Police Department detectives attached to the Organized Crime Control Bureau (OCCB). In his house authorities found $584,683 in cash. He was later convicted of both federal and New Jersey state drug violations. The following year he was sentenced to 70 years in prison. Once convicted, Lucas provided evidence that led to more than 100 further drug- related convictions. For his safety in 1977, Lucas and his family were placed in the witness protection program.Cruz, Alicia (May 24, 2010). \\"Julianna Farrait, wife of ‚ÄòAmerican Gangster\\" Frank Lucas, arrested for trying to sell cocaine\\" . newjerseynewsroom.com.Jailal, Sarada (February 25, 2008). \\"The daughter of American Gangster Frank Lucas speaks at Ambler\\" . The Temple News. In 1981, after five years in custody, his 40-year Federal term and 30-year state term were reduced to time served plus lifetime parole. In 1984, he was caught and convicted of trying to exchange one ounce of heroin and $13,000 for one kilogram of cocaine. He received a sentence of seven years and was released from prison in 1991. Depictions in media =American Gangster (2007)= Lucas' life was dramatized in the Universal Pictures crime film American Gangster (2007), in which he was portrayed by Denzel Washington. Lucas was often on set during the filming providing advice, on how he carried his gun, for example. In an interview with MSNBC, Lucas expressed his excitement about the film and amazement at Washington's portrayal, though he admitted only a small portion of the film was true, much of it fabricated for narrative effect. In addition, Lucas's former defense lawyer Richie Roberts, criticized the film for portraying him in a custody battle while in real life Roberts never had a child; he also criticized the portrayal of Lucas, describing it as \\"almost noble\\". Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. described the film as \\"one percent reality and ninety-nine percent Hollywood.\\" In addition, Johnson described the real life Lucas as \\"illiterate, vicious, violent, and everything Denzel Washington was not.\\" Former DEA agents Jack Toal, Gregory Korniloff, and Louis Diaz filed a lawsuit against Universal, saying the events in the film were fictionalized and that the film defamed them and hundreds of other agents. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon. McMahon noted the intertitle at the end of the film was \\"wholly inaccurate\\", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished, \\"It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films\\", she stated the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to \\"show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent\\". Many of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as his being the right-hand man of Bumpy Johnson, rising above the power of the Mafia and Nicky Barnes, and being the mastermind behind the Golden Triangle heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a Lucas biographer, said there was no evidence to confirm Lucas' claim that he once (in 2008, and not frequently, as some sources had suggested) used coffins to ship heroin. Associated Press entertainment writer Frank Coyle noted, \\"[T]his mess happened partially because journalists have been relying on secondary sources removed from the actual events.\\" =Television= * American Gangster, Season 2, Episode 5, featured Lucas. * The Gangland episode \\"American Gangster\\" (November 1, 2007) features Lucas, Nicky Barnes, and The Council drug syndicate. * Lucas was featured in the third episode of the first season of the Netflix documentary series Drug Lords, in which he told his side of the story. Personal life Lucas married Julianna Farrait-Rodriguez (n√©e Farrait), a homecoming queen from Puerto Rico. The two often bought each other expensive gifts, including a coat for which she paid $125,000 and a matching hat for which she paid $40,000 cash. Farrait was also jailed for her role in her husband's criminal enterprise, and spent five years in prison. After she was released, the couple lived separately for some years, and Farrait moved back to Puerto Rico. However, they reconciled in 2006. They had been married for more than 40 years. Farrait was arrested again in May 2010, and sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to sell two kilograms of cocaine to a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant at a hotel in Puerto Rico. Lucas fathered seven children, including a daughter, Francine Lucas-Sinclair, and a son, Frank Lucas, Jr. Lucas-Sinclair entered the witness protection program with Lucas in 1977 and has since started a website, Yellow Brick Road, containing resources for the children of imprisoned parents. Final years and death In his last years, Lucas was confined to a wheelchair due to a car accident which broke his legs. Lucas died at the age of 88 on May 30, 2019, in Cedar Grove, New Jersey.Daniel Kreps: Frank Lucas, ‚ÄòAmerican Gangster‚Äô Drug Kingpin, Dead at 88.

Rivers III is an American activist, and Pentecostal minister based in Boston, Massachusetts.  Biography  Eugene Franklin Rivers, III, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 9, 1950. His parents were Eugene F. Rivers II and Mildred Bell Rivers. He grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, graduating high school from the Murrell Dobbins Vocational High School in 1968. He was a gang member in Philadelphia, but left the gang, after being mentored by Reverend Benjamin Smith, the pastor of Deliverance Evangelistic Temple. Rivers wanted to be a painter, and enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While a student, he increased his involvement in grassroots activism in Philadelphia and beyond. He joined Black Church-affiliated movements working on black liberation, economic empowerment and urban redevelopment. He was connected with the Black Economic Development Conference, and supported James Forman's efforts to obtain reparations from churches and synagogues in the United States. Rivers moved to Boston, and began studying at Harvard College in 1976. In 1984, he founded the Azusa Christian Community in Dorchester, serving as pastor. He also founded the Ella J. Baker House, in Dorchester, as a community youth center. Concerned about gang violence, and the high number of youth being killed by gun violence, he joined with other black clergy to found the Boston TenPoint Coalition in 1992. The Coalition's efforts succeeded in reducing violence in Boston's neighborhoods, and led to what has been called the \\"Boston Miracle.\\" Rivers became co-chair of the National TenPoint Leadership Foundation, and was widely seen as an expert on strategies for reducing urban violence that impacts African Americans. Rivers served as an advisor to Presidents George H.W. Bush in urban issues. He has appeared on national television shows, including Hardball with Chris Matthews with Michael Rogers defending Rick Warren. He was featured on the cover of Newsweek Magazine in 1998, and he was written about in Commonwealth Magazine 1999. He is also an adviser to Bishop Charles Blake for Save Africa's Children.

The Chiefs of Clan Fraser often use the Gaelic patronym MacShimidh, meaning Son of Simon. Simon is the favoured family name for the Chiefs of Clan Fraser. They are often numbered 1st MacShimidh, 2nd MacShimidh, 3rd MacShimidh, etc. There is some debate on where exactly the numbering should start, as Fraser ties to Lovat land go back at least as far as 1253. The line does not necessarily represent a direct line of descent, though most Chiefs took on their responsibility upon the death of their father.

The Lord Lyon did not grant the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser, simply a description of \\"Chief of the name and arms.\\" The Lord Lyon does not have power over the Chiefship of a Highland Clan.Maclean of Ardgour v. Maclean 1941 S.C. 613 from Documents of the Lord Lyon, from Heraldica.org Since this decree, there has been much confusion as to the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser. When Simon the Pater's descendants first acquired the Lovat lands of the Ard, in the Highlands, they took to the Gaelic customs of the area. This included everything from language, ways of warfare, to clothing and fashion, even giving their children Gaelic names. By the time Simon's son came of age to lead the family, he was deemed to be the 1st Chief of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh.\\"The Frasers of Philorth, Now Saltoun\\" from the Clan Fraser Association for California Frasers who stayed in the Lowlands, however, maintained Teutonic (Germanic), or Norman culture. They became a very respectable and well-to-do family, but stayed well out of Clan affairs. They took no part in Clan warfare, spoke Scots, and dressed like Lowlanders. According to Alexander Fraser, 18th Lord Saltoun, his family \\"continued to have their principal seat in the Lowlands, and those of the surname who remained in that section of Scotland, where Teutonic institutions prevailed, and whence the patriarchal system of Clans and Clanships had long been banished, had nothing to do with the origin or formation of the Highland Clan, and never belonged to it.\\" According to the Lady Saltoun, his descendant, \\"The Frasers of Philorth, the Lords Saltoun, being the senior line, are Chiefs of the name of Fraser, although a lowland family. Lord Lovat is Chief of the very numerous Highland Clan Fraser of Lovat, based in Inverness-shire.\\" Two Chiefs from FraserChief, the website of the Lady Saltoun The Lady Saltoun is not a descendant of the Shimidh, the Simon from whom the Clan Fraser traces its lineage. As explained elsewhere, she is descended from the Shimidh's older brother. So, though the Lord Lovat is still the Chieftain of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh, the Lord Lyon has made official the seniority of the Lady Saltoun's line. The selection of a clan chieftain is traditionally very different than the Teutonic/Norman system of inherited titles. A Clan would elect and follow whatever chief it chose. Unfortunately, from a history student's perspective, in the case of the Clan Fraser, this decree has muddied the waters a bit, regarding both what the Clan truly is and has been. Frasers differ on the matter, but most Lovats still regard the Lord Lovat as their chief, while many lowland Frasers, who have latched on to the romanticised view of Clans and the Highlands, are happy to have found a way to link themselves to Highland culture. There is, of course, some cross-over of opinions, and Frasers tend to respect each other as fellow Frasers, regardless of where they come from. See also *Scottish clan chief Notes References * J.R.

Wilkin won numerous awards over the years and was referred to as \\"The Den Mother of Music Row,\\" as chronicled in her 1978 biography Lord, Let Me Leave a Song (authored with Darryl E. Hicks). It was honored as ‚ÄúOne of the 100 Most Important Books about Nashville‚Äôs Music Industry.‚Äù Biography Wilkin was born in Kemp, Texas and raised in Sanger, Texas, north of Dallas. She became a teacher, and was widowed when her husband Bedford Russell was killed in World War II. She remarried in 1946, with one son; her 1950 marriage to Art Wilkin, Jr. was her third. Her father, a baker, had been a fiddle player. From 1955 she toured with Red Foley, and in 1956 her songs were recorded by Mitchell Torok and Wanda Jackson. In 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and had major hits, written with John D. Loudermilk, for Stonewall Jackson (the number one country hit \\"Waterloo\\", which made the pop top ten) and Jimmy C. Newman. Wilkin also wrote \\"The Long Black Veil\\" for Lefty Frizzell (with Danny Dill), \\"Cut Across Shorty\\" for Eddie Cochran (with Wayne P. Walker), and \\"I Just Don't Understand\\" which became a pop hit for Ann-Margret and was covered by The Beatles. Although she was primarily a country songwriter, her songs have been recorded by several pop and rock acts, including Rod Stewart and Mick Jagger. Wilkin also recorded occasionally for Columbia Records and Dot Records in the 1960s and at times worked as a background vocalist. he is billed simply as Marijohn on a few of her recordings. On DOT records, she recorded under the name Romi Spain. Marijohn Wilkin may be most famous for \\"One Day at a Time\\", often considered the biggest gospel song of the 1970s. Wilkin wrote the song in 1973 with some assistance by her former prot√©g√© Kris Kristofferson. The song won a Dove Award from the Gospel Music Association in 1975 (see also: Dove Award for Song of the Year). The song was a top 20 country single for Marilyn Sellars in 1974 and hit No. 37 on Billboard's Hot 100 pop chart. It also launched a career as a gospel recording artist for Wilkin, who released several albums on Word Records. A remake became a No. 1 country hit for Cristy Lane in 1980 and has since been recorded more than 200 times. Even though written as a personal worship song, it has also been recognized as \\"One of the Top 50 Southern Gospel Songs.\\" Johnny Duncan and Ed Bruce were among the many songwriters she helped get a foothold in the music business. Kris Kristofferson was in the army with one of her distant cousins, so he sent some of his work to her at Buckhorn, her publishing company. She became the first to publish his songs, notably \\"For the good times\\". In 1970, it became a massive pop and country hit for Ray Price. Wilkin is credited for the discovery of Kristofferson and being the first person to give him work as a legitimate songwriter. Wilkin's son John \\"Bucky\\" Wilkin became the frontman of the 1960s surf rock group Ronny & the Daytonas, whose 1964 debut single \\"G.T.O.\\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.

In the 1920s, the highway originally connected Sterling in southwest Arenac County with Prescott in southeast Ogemaw County. The route was later adjusted to run from M-76 near Sterling along a convoluted route through Maple Ridge and Prescott to end at M-55 in Nester's Corners. The highway was still a gravel road when the designation was removed by 1960. Route description The final route used by M-70 followed Melita Road starting at M-76 northwest of Sterling. The highway ran north and crossed the Rifle River at a point between sections of the Ogemaw State Forest. The highway turned east on Main Street Road in Melita. From there, M-70 ran east on Main Street Road to the junction with Reed Road where it turned northward to Maple Ridge Road. The highway followed Maple Ridge Road east into Maple Ridge and turned north on Briggs Road. Crossing the Ogemaw‚ÄìArenac county line, the road name changed to Sage Lake Road into the village of Prescott. From there, it turned westerly on Greenwood Road through downtown Prescott, and north on Clark Road to end at M-55 one mile (1.6 km) west of Nester Corners, which is the intersection of South Sage Lake Road and M-55. History M-70 was first shown on a state map on July 1, 1919, with the debut of the Michigan state trunkline highway system. The original routing was shown between M-76 at Sterling and M-55 at Prescott. In 1929, M-55 was shifted to run due east from Selkirk to US Highway 23 north of Whittemore. The segment east of Prescott to Whittemore was turned over to the county, but the section north of Prescott was added to M-70. This extended M-70 north to its terminus in Nester's Corners. The designation was decommissioned by July 1, 1960. At the time, the highway was still a gravel road.

It is a part of the Wayne-Westland Community Schools district. History One of two traditional high schools serving the Wayne- Westland Community Schools, John Glenn High School is located in the city of Westland, Michigan. The school, which opened in 1964, was named for astronaut John Glenn, who just two years prior had become the first American to orbit the earth. The \\"space\\" theme dominates at JGHS, including the nickname (Rockets), yearbook (the Satellite), newspaper (the Explorer, formerly the Echo), and school store (the Gantry). When John Glenn High School opened its doors in 1964, it did not have its own football field, having to play home games on the field of rival Wayne Memorial High School for the better part of its first decade. The building was only a fraction of its current size. To keep up with expanding enrollment in the 1970s and 1980s, new wings were added for Fine Arts and Special Education, as well as a new gymnasium and its own football and baseball fields. Fitting for a school named for an astronaut, JGHS is one of the few high schools in the state to feature a planetarium. When John Glenn High School opened under principal Frank Higgins, it served students in grades 7-11, expanding to grades 8-12 from 1965-67. After a brief stint as a four-year high school (9-12), it stabilized as a 10-12th grade school in 1970, finally returning to its 9-12 status in 1995 when the Wayne- Westland district adopted a middle school format. Demographics The demographic breakdown of the 1,840 students enrolled in 2014-2015 was: *Male - 51.3% *Female - 48.7% *Native American/Alaskan - 0.2% *Asian/Pacific islanders - 1.5% *Black - 41.5% *Hispanic - 3.9% *White - 51.6% *Multiracial - 1.3% 54.3% of the students were eligible for free or reduced lunch.

It serves as a connector between M-21 in Owosso to Interstate 69 (I-69) near Durand. The highway runs along a rail line in a northwest-to- southeast direction in rural Shiawassee County connecting a few small towns along its path. The highway dates back to the start of the state highway system in 1919. There were some changes made to the routing in the 1930s which increased its length. Two adjacent highways have been rerouted which affected the locations of M-71's termini. The last such change was made in the 1960s when the M-78 freeway (now I-69) was completed near Durand. Route description M-71 starts in downtown Owosso at the corner of Main Street (M-21) and Water Street. It follows Water Street southeasterly until it reaches Washington Street. The highway follows Washington Street south and over the Shiawassee River and turns southeasterly on Corunna Avenue. M-71 runs parallel to, and in between, the river and a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Corunna Avenue continues this way through the community of Middletown and into Corunna. M-71 turns south through downtown Corunna on Shiawassee Street to McNeil Street. It is along this stretch of the highway that the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measured the highest traffic volumes for M-71. In their 2009 survey, MDOT calculated that 10,577 vehicles used this section of roadway in a measurement called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value is a count for the average traffic in a day for any average day of the year. From that junction, M-71 turns easterly and then southeasterly out of town. The highway continues to run alongside the rail line through farmland to the outskirts of Vernon. M-71 crosses the Shiawassee River for a second time. The rail line and the highway diverge and run on opposite sides of town; the highway rounds the northeast side and the rail line runs along the southwest side. This section of trunkline through Vernon had the lowest AADT value in 2009 with 4,371 vehicles. M-71 continues to the interchange with I-69 at exit 118 northwest of Durand, where the highway designation terminates. No part of M-71 has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. History M-71 was formed by July 1, 1919 as a spur route from M-21, which ran along Lytle Road, southerly to Durand. Around 1925, a realignment of M-21 produced changes in M-71. M-21 was rerouted to its current alignment between Owosso and Lennon, and M-71 took over the roadway between Owosso and Corunna. At the same time, M-71 was shifted to run through Vernon. The section of M-71 between Durand and M-78 was transferred to M-78 and M-71 was shortened by 1934. This transfer was reversed in 1935 when M-78 construction was completed. A new section of M-71 was built parallel to the Ann Arbor Railroad between Durand and Corunna in 1938. This construction paved the last remaining unpaved segment of M-71. The section of M-71 south of M-78 into Durand was turned back to local control in early 1939, and M-71 was shortened one final time with the completion of the M-78 freeway (now I-69) in the area in late 1960 or early 1961. At that time, the eastern terminus was shifted to the freeway interchange instead of the old route of M-78 along Lansing Road.

The railroad interchanges with the Canadian Pacific Railway in Kenmare, North Dakota and Thief River Falls, Minnesota; the Minnesota Northern Railroad in Thief River Falls, Minnesota; and the BNSF Railway in Ardoch, North Dakota. The railroad has its headquarters in Fordville, North Dakota, where it operates its largest yard facility, and also has a field office located in Lansford, North Dakota, where it operates another large yard and roundhouse. As of 2006, the Northern Plains Railroad employed 43 people and handled approximately 17,000 carloads per year. The primary commodities hauled included wheat, barley, durum, and soybeans. History = Formation = The Northern Plains Railroad was formed in January 1997 after the Soo Line Railroad, under control as a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway, decided to lease of branch line trackage in Minnesota and North Dakota. The track originally leased to the railroad consisted of the Devils Lake Subdivision between Thief River Falls, Minnesota, and Harlow, North Dakota, and the Bisbee Subdivision between Fordville, North Dakota, and Kenmare, North Dakota. The two lines formed the Soo Line Railroad's so-called \\"wheatline\\" that served as a connection between its main line from Glenwood, Minnesota, to Noyes, Minnesota, (and on to Winnipeg, Manitoba, via the Canadian Pacific) and its main line from Glenwood, Minnesota, to Portal, North Dakota, (and on to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, via the Canadian Pacific). Before coming under control of the BNSF Railway, the Sarles Subdivision had been owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad and, before that, by the Great Northern Railway. The line was one of the latter railroad‚Äôs many branch lines built in the early twentieth century to serve communities in northern North Dakota = Merger = In 2000 and 2001 the Mohall Central Railroad and the Northern Plains Railroad teamed up to begin operating track sold by the BNSF Railway. The Mohall Central Railroad agreed to purchase and then let the Northern Plains Railroad operate over both a portion of the Drayton Subdivision between Honeyford, North Dakota, and Voss, North Dakota, and a portion of the Granville Subdivision between milepost 5.25 (north of Granville, North Dakota) and Mohall, North Dakota. In the fall of 2005, the Northern Plains Railroad and the Mohall Central Railroad came together once more to begin operations over a portion of the BNSF Railway‚Äôs Sarles Subdivision between milepost 3.75 (north of Lakota, North Dakota) and Sarles, North Dakota. The BNSF Railway agreed to sell its track to the Mohall Central Railroad. In turn, the Mohall Central Railroad agreed to let the Northern Plains Railroad begin operating over the line. Connecting track near Munich, North Dakota, where the Sarles Subdivision crosses the Bisbee Subdivision, was also put in place. On October 29, 2007, the Mohall Central Railroad filed a notice of exemption to abandon a portion of the line between milepost 3.75 north of Lakota, North Dakota, and milepost 48.19 at Alsen Junction, North Dakota, approximately south of Munich, North Dakota. = Cutbacks = After the Mohall Central Railroad purchased the Granville Subdivision, it quickly abandoned a portion of it between milepost 5.25 and milepost 35.00 (at Forfar siding south of Lansford, North Dakota). The part of the subdivision still in service, , was then renamed the Mohall Subdivision. Likewise, the portion of the Drayton Subdivision that the Mohall Central Railroad had also acquired was renamed the Gilby Subdivision. The portion of the line between Forest River, North Dakota and Voss, North Dakota would later be abandoned. Both portions of track purchased by the Mohall Central Railroad had been owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad before coming under ownership of the BNSF Railway. Before that, the Mohall Subdivision had formed a branch line on the Great Northern Railway that stretched from Granville, North Dakota to Sherwood, North Dakota. The Gilby Subdivision, on the other hand, had formed the Northern Pacific Railway‚Äôs main line from Manitoba Junction, Minnesota (near Hawley, Minnesota) to Winnipeg, Manitoba. In October 2004, the Northern Plains Railroad‚Äîacting through its parent, the Soo Line Railroad‚Äîabandoned a portion of the Devils Lake Subdivision between Harlow, North Dakota and Devils Lake, North Dakota. Part of the roadbed had become submerged in the steadily increasing water level of Devils Lake. In December 2009, the Northern Plains Railroad‚Äîagain acting through the Soo Line Railroad‚Äîabandoned of the Bisbee Subdivision between Bisbee, North Dakota and Kramer, North Dakota. Locomotive and freight car fleet The Northern Plains Railroad operates around 25 locomotives, mostly largely rebuilt EMD GP35s of various heritages. The railroad‚Äôs official paint scheme contains yellow and navy blue colors arranged in much the same way as the colors on the \\"yellowbonnets\\" that once operated on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway were arranged. The words Northern Plains are spelled out on both the nose and the long hood. Many of the locomotives operating on the Northern Plains Railroad continue to wear the colors of their former owners. This includes at least four former Union Pacific Railroad EMD SD40T-2 locomotiveshttp://www.railpictures.net/photo/629057/. Most of the freight cars that the Northern Plains Railroad uses are provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway, while the rest are provided by the BNSF Railway and Minnesota Northern Railroad. Northern Plains rail services The Northern Plains Railroad also operates a railcar repair and locomotive repainting facility in Fordville, North Dakota under the name Northern Plains Rail Services. The facility contracts with other railroads, shippers, industries, processors, owners, and lessors to make either small-scale or large-scale repairs to freight cars or provide new paint to locomotives. Some of the past locomotive repainting customers have included the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Belt Railway of Chicago.

Biography Johann's father, farmer and butcher Georg Schicht, started to produce soap in his house in Rynoltice in 1848. Commercial success allowed him to buy a new house and in 1867 to set a soap boiling plant. In 1878 he handed the factory, named \\"Georg Schicht\\", to his four sons. The name was kept as a trademark until 1951. Johann Schicht, the oldest son, most competent and skilled suggested in 1873 moving the factory into √öst√≠ nad Labem to reduce problems with transportation of bulk raw material. Now he took the chance to realise his plans and in 1880 a new soap- making plant was built between the villages of Kramoly and Novosedlice, in what is today St≈ôekov, part of √öst√≠ nad Labem. Since 1885 the small company (12 employees) grew rapidly, selling among others candles, margarine, water glass, stearin and glycerin. Very popular was their \\"soap with a stag\\" (m√Ωdlo s jelenem), produced since the end of 19th century until 2002. As an adversary of alcoholism Schicht started production of fruit juice named \\"Ceres saft\\". The brand name \\"Ceres\\" (after a Roman goddess) was used for several food products and is seen until today. The company established its own mechanical engineering plant and a forge, operated coal mines and power plant and invested in range of companies in chemical and food processing industry. A branch in Moravsk√° Ostrava was set up in 1906. Because of health problems Johann Schicht changed, in 1906, the family business into a joint-stock company (members of Schicht family owned 80%). At the moment of Schicht's death in 1907 the concern employed over 1,800 people. Heinrich Schicht, son of Johann, followed as the company's president. Johann Schicht was an active member of many commercial and cultural clubs and associations. In 1898 he was awarded with the title of Imperial Councilor for his contribution to the development of industry in Austria-Hungary. Schicht had been compared to other Czech industrialists Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a and Emil ≈†koda; like them he tried to build a large integrated business empire, provided extensive social care for the employees and used modern technology, management and marketing to stay ahead of competition.

It is one of the only two naval aerobatic teams in the world, the other being the Blue Angels of the US Navy. The team uses four Hindustan Aeronautics HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 trainer aircraft, and is based at the Naval Air Station INS Hansa in Dabolim, Southern India. The colour scheme used by the aircraft is dark blue on white. The team started training for aerobatics in late 2001. The Squadron Commander of INAS 551, then, was Cdr J.S. Tewatia. The work-up at that time was, however, informal. The drive gained formal momentum in the latter half of 2002. The paint scheme of the aircraft was changed to the current one and the aircraft were modified for smoke emission with the inboard stations modified for carriage of kerosene tanks mixed with colour dyes (without a dye, kerosene puts out white smoke). The Team was initially called as Sagar Kiran and it is under this name that the team made its formal inaugural debut display (then with only three aircraft) in Kochi, India on 11 May 2003 for the Golden Jubilee of the Indian Naval Aviation. The founding Leader of the Team was Cdr. Surendra Ahuja. The formation of the team gave the Indian Naval Air Squadron 551 a new role. The squadron had on some occasions in the past also attempted to set up an aerobatic team and but the attempts were informal and were not sustained for long enough to assume any significant formality. The other members of the inaugural team in 2003 were Lt. Cdr. Yogesh Garud (who later, as a Commander, led the team) and Lt. Cdr. N. Thiagarajan. The team's name was later changed to the present name of Sagar Pawan. The new name was selected from among a few others that were suggested by the then Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command Vice Admiral Arun Prakash (later Admiral and CNS). The team is also referred to as INSPAT - Indian Navy Sagar Pawan Aerobatic Team or SPAT. Since then the other team leaders have been Cdr. Sameer Mehra, Cdr. Yogesh Garud and Cdr. Satyen Vartak. The team is led by Cdr Yashwant Hemant Karkare.

Its purpose was to serve as an aerial umbrella for the defense of the U.S. Marine Corps Khe Sanh Combat Base on the Khe Sanh Plateau, in western Quang Tri Province of the Republic of Vietnam. The base was under siege by an estimated three-divisional force of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). Niagara I During the last four months of 1967 a series of fierce border battles erupted in South Vietnam that cast a shadow on what had been a positive year for U.S. forces in Southeast Asia. Beginning in mid-September, PAVN began the continuous shelling of a Marine outpost located at Con Thien, near the Demilitarized Zone in northern Quang Tri Province. After an aerial onslaught dubbed Operation Neutralize, PAVN pressure abated at the end of October. At the beginning of November, PAVN was discovered operating in force near the Special Forces outpost at Dak To, in the Central Highlands. After one month of intense fighting, the PAVN forces had faded back across the border. Quang Tri Province and the DMZ. In January 1968, the recently installed electronic sensors of Operation Igloo White, which were undergoing their test and evaluation phase in southeastern Laos, were alerted to a flurry of PAVN activity along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos opposite the northwestern corner of South Vietnam. It was due to the extensive nature of these activities that Operation Niagara I ‚Äì an intelligence collection effort by CIA roadwatch teams, the recon teams of the highly secret Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group, and aerial photo reconnaissance aircraft, was launched. Intelligence confirmed that PAVN forces were indeed in the process of building up for an offensive, but what was to be its target? Later in the month Marine patrols from the Khe Sanh Combat Base tripped off a series of actions that confirmed that three PAVN divisions: the 304th, 320th, 325C and a regiment of the 324th were already near, or advancing toward, Khe Sanh. It was at this point that the U.S. commander in Vietnam, General William C. Westmoreland, decided to reinforce the Marine position (Khe Sanh was a key border surveillance outpost and was also considered a prime jump-off point for any future incursion into Laos. This was a risky proposition, considering that the North Vietnamese were expected to isolate the base by cutting off Route 9, the only roadway into the area. Aerial resupply would have to make up the difference, but the ongoing northwest monsoon, which was bound to shroud the area in rain, mist, and fog, would make this attempt problematic. Westmoreland was undaunted. He believed that American air power would prevent a repeat of the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which rapidly became the point of comparison, both among military officers and the media. Inter- service rivalry Westmoreland and his deputy commander for air operations, General William W. Momyer (who was also commander of the Seventh Air Force) had been awaiting exactly such an opportunity. PAVN forces would be massing in a single geographic area in divisional strength in a remote unpopulated region where there would be no restrictions on bombing missions. Westmoreland gave Momyer the responsibility of coordinating all air assets during the operation to support Khe Sanh. This caused problems for the Marines, however, who possessed their own aviation squadrons and operated under their own close air support doctrine. They were reluctant to relinquish authority to an Air Force general. General Westmoreland commanded forces only in geographical South Vietnam and in its air space (through the Seventh Air Force). The bombing campaign against North Vietnam was controlled by CINCPAC in Honolulu, while responsibility for the aerial interdiction campaigns in Laos were split between the Seventh and Seventh/Thirteenth Air Forces. This arrangement went against the grain of Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transfer them as the situation changed. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On January 19, Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up to the chain of command to CINCPAC, Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, Jr., in Honolulu. Meanwhile, heated debate ensued among Westmoreland, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Marine Corps Commandant Leonard F. Chapman Jr., Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson backed the Marine position due to his concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option. The perennial interservice rivalry over missions and assets (which had plagued the services since the creation of the National Security Act of 1947) raged anew. Westmoreland went so far as to threaten to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, for the first time during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed, if only temporarily, under the control of a single manager. Niagara II On 21 January the PAVN opened a continuous artillery barrage directed at Khe Sanh. It was also the launch day for Operation Niagara II. The Marine Direct Air Support Center (DASC), located at the Combat Base, was responsible for the coordination of air strikes with artillery fire. An airborne battlefield command and control center (ABCCC), in the form of a C-130 Hercules, directed strike aircraft to targets called in by ground troops and marked by forward air control (FAC) aircraft. When weather conditions prevented FAC-directed strikes, the strike bombers were directed to their targets by either a Marine TPQ-10 radar installation located at the combat base or by Air Force Combat Skyspot MSQ-77 radar stations. This Ground Directed Bombing (GDB) radar system could direct aircraft to their targets in inclement weather and in absolute darkness. Thus began what many considered the most concentrated application of aerial firepower in the history of warfare. On an average day 350 tactical fighter- bombers, 60 B-52 Stratofortress, and 30 observation aircraft operated near the base. Westmoreland ordered Operation Igloo White to assist in the defense of Khe Sanh even though the system was only then undergoing its test and evaluation phase in Laos. On 20 January the first sensor drops took place by Observation Squadron Sixty-Seven (VO-67) and by the end of the month 316 acoustic and seismic sensors had been dropped in 44 strings. The Marines credited 40 percent of intelligence available to their fire support coordination center at the base to the sensors. B-52 strikes supporting the Marines were originally restricted by the Marine commander, Colonel David E. Lownds, to bombing no closer than two miles from his front lines. The PAVN utilized this gap to move forward and \\"grab the enemy by the belt\\" and avoid the bombing. Momyer demonstrated the effectiveness of the Stratofortress as a tactical platform by bringing the B-52 strikes safely to within three-quarters of a mile of the base and the restriction was lifted. One PAVN prisoner reported that three- quarters of his entire regiment was lost to one B-52 raid alone. Even though Westmoreland was concentrating an unprecedented amount of firepower against PAVN forces in the vicinity of Khe Sanh, he feared that it might not be enough. For the first time, the American commander seriously considered the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. In 1976, he revealed that \\"Although I established a small secret group to study the subject, Washington so feared that some word of it might manage to reach the press that I was told to desist.\\" During January, PAVN and the Marines contested the outlying hills for control of the high ground and carried out daily artillery and mortar duels. On 7 February, however, North Vietnamese infantry, backed by Soviet-built PT-76 tanks, overran the Special Forces border camp at Lang Vei, only seven miles west of Khe Sanh Combat Base. This was the first instance of the use of armor by PAVN during the conflict. Although the North Vietnamese continued to probe the American's defenses, the attack on Lang Vei was the last major effort by PAVN. Canberra bombers operated by No. 2 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force also flew close air support missions as part of Operation Niagara. Riddle of Khe Sanh During the campaign, the USAF had flown 9,691 sorties and dropped 14,223 tons of bombs. The Marine Corps's aviation wing flew 7,098 sorties and carried 17,015 tons of mixed munitions. Naval aviation (even though concurrently conducting the bulk of Operation Rolling Thunder missions over the DRV) contributed 5,337 sorties and 7,941 tons of bombs. By the end of March the PAVN had begun to withdraw from the area. General Westmoreland, accepting Air Force estimates that claimed 9,800‚Äì13,000 PAVN troops killed or wounded, considered American air superiority to be an important contributor to the battle.

The highway ran through rural Missaukee County connecting Pioneer with Merritt. The highway was designated by 1919 along a longer route. It was shortened before it was totally removed from the highway system in the late 1930s. Route description M-74 started at a junction with M-66 near the community of Pioneer. It ran east on Moorestown Road through Stittsville to Moorestown before turning south on Nelson Road. There it ran through the community of Star City, turning west briefly on Walker Road and running south on Star City Road before terminating at a junction with M-55 west of Merritt. All of M-74 was a gravel highway. History On July 1, 1919, M-74 ran between Pioneer and M-55 west of Merritt. There it turned east running concurrently with M-55 to Merritt where it turned south to Moddersville and terminated. The spur south of Merrit remained a state highway through at least late 1938. Late that year or early the next, the roadway between Merritt and Moddersville was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. By late 1939, the entire highway was decommissioned in its entirety. The highway designation has not been used since.

S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans). The best-known defender of the argument is the Christian writer C. S. Lewis. Briefly and roughly, the argument states that humans‚Äô natural desire for eternal happiness must be capable of satisfaction, because all natural desires are capable of satisfaction. Versions of the argument have been offered since the Middle Ages, and the argument continues to have defenders today, such as Peter Kreefthttp://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/desire.htm and Francis Collins.https://afterall.net/quotes/francis-s-collins-on-lewis-moral-argument/ Older forms of the argument Versions of the argument from desire were commonplace during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Here is how Aquinas states the argument: \\"[I]t is impossible for natural desire to be unfulfilled, since ‚Äònature does nothing in vain.‚Äô Now, natural desire would be in vain if it could never be fulfilled. Therefore, man's natural desire is capable of fulfillment, but not in this life . . . . So, it must be fulfilled after this life. Therefore, man's ultimate felicity comes after this life.\\"Thomas Aquinas, On the Truth of the Catholic Faith, Book 3, Part 1. Garden City, NY: Hanover House, 1945, p. 166. In this form, the argument depends crucially on the Aristotelian dictum that \\"nature does nothing in vain\\".Aristotle, Politics. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1948, p. 7. Medieval critics of the argument, such as Duns Scotus, questioned whether the dictum is strictly true. Scotus pointed out that many animals seem to have an instinct for self- preservation.Duns Scotus, Philosophical Writings: A Selection. Trans. by Allan Wolter, O.F. M.. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill, 1962, p. 168. Isn't this an example of an unfulfillable natural desire for eternal life? C. S. Lewis's version of the argument The most prominent recent defender of the argument from desire is the well-known Christian apologist C. S. Lewis (1898 ‚Äì 1963). Lewis offers slightly different forms of the argument in works such as Mere Christianity (1952), The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress (1933; 3rd ed., 1943), Surprised by Joy (1955), and \\"The Weight of Glory\\" (1940). Unlike medieval versions of the argument from desire, Lewis does not appeal to a universal, ever-present longing for eternal happiness but to a specific type of ardent and fleeting spiritual longing that he calls \\"Joy.\\" Lewis uses the term \\"Joy\\" in a special sense to refer to a particular type of desire, longing, or emotional response that he assumes will be familiar to at least most of his readers. Joy is a form of desire, Lewis claims, but of a unique sort. Experiences of Joy are brief, intense, thrilling \\"pangs\\" or \\"stabs\\" of longing that are at once both intensely desirable and achingly painful. Though Joy is a form of desire, it differs from all other desires in two respects. First, whereas other desires \\"are felt as pleasures only if satisfaction is expected in the near future,\\" with Joy \\"the mere wanting is felt to be somehow a delight.\\" Joy thus \\"cuts across our ordinary distinctions between wanting and having. To have it is, by definition, a want: to want it, we find, is to have it\\".C. S. Lewis, The Pilgrim's Regress. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1977, pp. 7-8. Second, Joy differs from all other desires in the mysteriousness or elusiveness of its object(s). With Joy, it is not clear exactly what is desired, and false leads are common. Many suppose, wrongly, that Joy is a desire for some particular worldly satisfaction (sex, aesthetic experience, etc.). But all such satisfactions, Lewis argues, turn out to be \\"false Florimels,\\" delusive images of wax that melt before one's eyes and invariably fail to provide the satisfaction they appear to promise. It is this second unique feature of Joy‚Äîthe fact that it is a strangely indefinite desire that apparently cannot be satisfied by any natural happiness attainable in this world‚Äîthat provides the linchpin for Lewis's argument from desire. As John Beversluis argues,John Beversluis, C. S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2007, p. 40. Lewis seems to offer both deductive and inductive versions of the argument from desire. In The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress, Lewis appears to argue deductively as follows: # Nature makes nothing (or at least no natural human desire) in vain. # Humans have a natural desire (Joy) that would be vain unless some object that is never fully given in my present mode of existence is obtainable by me in some future mode of existence. # Therefore, the object of this otherwise vain natural desire must exist and be obtainable in some future mode of existence.This is Peter S. Williams' formulation of the deductive version. See Peter S. Williams, \\"Pro: A Defense of C. S. Lewis's Argument from Desire,\\" in Gregory Bassham, ed., C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, p. 41. Elsewhere, however, Lewis uses cautious terms such as \\"probable\\" that suggest that the argument should be understood inductively. He writes, for example: \\"Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for these desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.\\"C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity. London: Fount, 1997, p. 113. \\"[W]e remain conscious of a desire which no natural happiness will satisfy. But is there any reason to suppose that reality offers any satisfaction of it? . . . A man‚Äôs physical hunger does not prove that that man will get any bread; he may die on a raft in the Atlantic. But surely a man‚Äôs hunger does prove that he comes of a race which repairs its body by eating and inhabits a world where eatable substances exist. In the same way, though I do not believe . . . that my desire for Paradise proves that I shall enjoy it, I think it a pretty good indication that such a thing exists and that some men will.\\"C. S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses. New York: Macmillan, 1949, p. 6. The inductive version of Lewis's argument from desire can be stated as follows: # Humans have by nature a desire for the transcendent. # Most natural desires are such that there exists some object capable of satisfying them. # Therefore, there is probably something transcendent.This is Trent Dougherty's formulation of the inductive argument from desire. Quoted by Peter S. Williams in \\"Pro: A Defense of C. S. Lewis's Argument from Desire,\\" p. 39. Modern variants The Catholic philosopher Peter Kreeft has phrased the argument from desire as follows: # Every natural, innate desire in us corresponds to some real object that can satisfy that desire. # But there exists in us a desire which nothing in time, nothing on earth, no creature can satisfy. # Therefore, there must exist something more than time, earth and creatures, which can satisfy this desire. He argued similarly to both Lewis and Aquinas in his formulation, as well as answering a set of objections. The first is whether the argument begs the question- to which he states that the opposite is true. The second is the question of whether everyone has such a desire- from which he argues that all do, although many deny such a need. The third of these is whether the argument is just Proslogoion rephrased, to which he responds that the two are separated by data and observed facts.http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/desire.htm The Catholic philosopher and Thomist Edward Feser has argued that the argument from desire is effective, but relies upon many other beliefs that require proofs to be given before it can work as a convincing argument; Feser thus believes it to be of less practical usage for persuading people than other arguments.https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2017/06/arguments-from- desire.html#more Criticisms Critics of the Lewis's argument from desire, such as John Beversluis and Gregory Bassham, claim that neither the deductive nor the inductive forms of the argument are successful. Among the questions critics raise are: * Is Joy, as Lewis describes it (as a \\"pang,\\" \\"stab\\" \\"fluttering in the diaphragm,\\" etc.), more properly characterized as an emotion rather than as a type of desire? * If Joy is a desire, is it a natural desire in the relevant sense? (Is it innate and universal, for example, like the biological desires Lewis cites?) * Is Joy (in the sense of a spiritual longing for the transcendent) relevantly similar to the kinds of innate, biological desires Lewis mentions (desires for food and sex, for example)? Or does the argument depend on a weak analogy? * Do we know, or have good reason to believe, that all natural desires have possible satisfactions? Is this Aristotelian claim still plausible in the light of modern evolutionary theory? Don't humans naturally desire many things that don't seem to be attainable (e.g., to possess superhuman or magical powers, to know the future, to remain youthful and unaffected by the ravages of time, and so forth)? Is the natural desire for perfect and eternal happiness more like these fantasy-type desires, or more like the innate, biological desires that Lewis mentions?

Biography  She was born in Queens as Nellie Yvonne Reynolds, to parents who were Jamaican immigrants. She was private about her age but was probably born between 1931 and 1947, according to colleagues. She graduated with a B.A. in English from Queens College in 1969, a master's in English and American literature from Harvard in 1971, and a Ph.D. in the same field from Harvard in 1977. McKay was Assistant Professor of English and American Literature at Simmons College and Visiting Professor of Afro-American Literature at MIT between 1973 and 1978. McKay joined the faculty of UW‚ÄìMadison in 1978, receiving tenure in 1984. Her research specialties included 19th- and 20th- century American and African American literature, black women's literature and multicultural women's writings, all fields that essentially did not exist when she was a student, and whose modern curricula, by many accounts, became heavily indebted to her scholarship. Her colleague at UW‚ÄìMadison, Craig Werner, said, \\"When she came here there was not a single university that was paying any attention to black women‚Äôs literature. Now, there isn‚Äôt a single university that isn‚Äôt.\\" A former student recalls that, in 1979, McKay provided the class with photocopied versions of Native Son by Richard Wright and Black Manhattan by James Weldon Johnson, books that were then out of print, from her own rare copies. According to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, in 1991 she was offered the Harvard University post in Afro-American Studies that was later taken by Gates, whom she had recommended in her stead. By the time she collaborated with Gates on the Norton Anthology of African-American Literature, in 1996, she was already widely known as a pre-eminent scholar in the field of black American literature, and Gates specifically sought her out. The book became a worldwide standard in the field and remains in print in a second edition. It was selected by former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove in 2000 for the National Millennium Time Capsule created by the White House to be stored by the National Archives until the 22nd century, with Dove calling it \\"a lucid and eloquent history of one of this country's most significant subcultures\\". Her edited book Critical Essays on Toni Morrison (1988) is \\"largely credited with establishing the critical acclaim\\" that led to Morrison's Nobel Prize in Literature. She played a key role in establishing the UW‚ÄìMadison Lorraine Hansberry Visiting Professorship in the Dramatic Arts. At the time of her death, McKay had been working on a revised edition of the seminal 1982 black feminist anthology All the Women Are White, All the Blacks are Men, But Some of Us Brave: Black Women‚Äôs Studies, originally edited by Gloria T. Hull, Patricia Bell-Scott, and Barbara Smith. She was also advisory editor for the African American Review, president of the Midwest Consortium of Black Studies and a member of the Board of Directors of the Toni Morrison Society. McKay died January 22, 2006, of liver cancer or colon cancer at a hospice in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. She was believed to be in her 70s. The university held a national symposium in her honor April 1, 2006, including a short film Remembering Nellie McKay by Pete McPartland Jr., and readings by over 40 fellow academics from across the country.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ), was a Chilean poet-diplomat and politician who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. Neruda became known as a poet when he was 13 years old, and wrote in a variety of styles, including surrealist poems, historical epics, overtly political manifestos, a prose autobiography, and passionate love poems such as the ones in his collection Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair (1924). Neruda occupied many diplomatic positions in various countries during his lifetime and served a term as a Senator for the Chilean Communist Party. When President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla outlawed communism in Chile in 1948, a warrant was issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months in the basement of a house in the port city of Valpara√≠so; Neruda escaped through a mountain pass near Maihue Lake into Argentina. Years later, Neruda was a close advisor to Chile's socialist President Salvador Allende. When Neruda returned to Chile after his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Allende invited him to read at the Estadio Nacional before 70,000 people. In Spanish and English. Neruda was hospitalized with cancer in September 1973, at the time of the coup d'√©tat led by Augusto Pinochet that overthrew Allende's government, but returned home after a few days when he suspected a doctor of injecting him with an unknown substance for the purpose of murdering him on Pinochet's orders. Neruda died in his house in Isla Negra on 23 September 1973, just hours after leaving the hospital. Although it was long reported that he died of heart failure, the Interior Ministry of the Chilean government issued a statement in 2015 acknowledging a Ministry document indicating the government's official position that \\"it was clearly possible and highly likely\\" that Neruda was killed as a result of \\"the intervention of third parties\\". However, an international forensic test conducted in 2013 rejected allegations that he was poisoned and concluded that he was suffering from prostate cancer.https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo- way/2013/11/08/243949324/poet-pablo-neruda-was-not-poisoned-officials-in- chile-say Pinochet, backed by elements of the armed forces, denied permission for Neruda's funeral to be made a public event, but thousands of grieving Chileans disobeyed the curfew and crowded the streets. Neruda is often considered the national poet of Chile, and his works have been popular and influential worldwide. The Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez once called him \\"the greatest poet of the 20th century in any language\\", and the critic Harold Bloom included Neruda as one of the writers central to the Western tradition in his book The Western Canon. Early life Neruda as a young man Pablo Neruda was born Ricardo Eli√©cer Neftal√≠ Reyes Basoalto on 12 July 1904, in Parral, Chile, a city in Linares Province, now part of the greater Maule Region, some 350 km south of Santiago,Tarn (1975) p. 13 to Jos√© del Carmen Reyes Morales, a railway employee, and Rosa Neftal√≠ Basoalto Opazo, a schoolteacher who died two months after he was born. Soon after her death, Reyes moved to Temuco, where he married a woman, Trinidad Candia Malverde, with whom he had another child born nine years earlier, a boy named Rodolfo de la Rosa.Feinstein (2005) p. 7 Neruda grew up in Temuco with Rodolfo and a half-sister, Laura Herminia \\"Laurita\\", from one of his father's extramarital affairs (her mother was Aurelia Tolr√†, a Catalan woman). He composed his first poems in the winter of 1914. Neruda was an atheist.Adam Feinstein (2005). Pablo Neruda: A Passion For Life. Bloomsbury Publishing USA. p. 97. . Despite their political differences and the fact that she was religious and Neruda was an atheist, Pablo had far more in common with Bombal than with Maruca. =Literary career= Neruda's father opposed his son's interest in writing and literature, but he received encouragement from others, including the future Nobel Prize winner Gabriela Mistral, who headed the local school. On 18 July 1917, at the age of thirteen, he published his first work, an essay titled \\"Entusiasmo y perseverancia\\" (\\"Enthusiasm and Perseverance\\") in the local daily newspaper La Ma√±ana, and signed it Neftal√≠ Reyes.Feinstein (2005) p. 19 From 1918 to mid-1920, he published numerous poems, such as \\"Mis ojos\\" (\\"My eyes\\"), and essays in local magazines as Neftal√≠ Reyes. In 1919, he participated in the literary contest Juegos Florales del Maule and won third place for his poem \\"Comuni√≥n ideal\\" or \\"Nocturno ideal\\". By mid-1920, when he adopted the pseudonym Pablo Neruda, he was a published author of poems, prose, and journalism. He is thought to have derived his pen name from the Czech poet Jan Neruda,Pablo Neruda. Biography.com. though other sources say the true inspiration was Moravian violinist Wilma Neruda, which name appears in Arthur Conan Doyle's novel A Study in Scarlet. The young poet's intention in publishing under a pseudonym was to avoid his father's disapproval of his poems. In 1921, at the age of 16, Neruda moved to Santiago to study French at the Universidad de Chile, with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, he was soon devoting all his time to writing poems and with the help of well- known writer Eduardo Barrios, he managed to meet and impress Don Carlos George Nascimento, the most important publisher in Chile at the time. In 1923, his first volume of verse, Crepusculario (Book of Twilights), was published by Editorial Nascimento, followed the next year by Veinte poemas de amor y una canci√≥n desesperada (Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song), a collection of love poems that was controversial for its eroticism, especially considering its author's young age. Both works were critically acclaimed and have been translated into many languages. Over the decades, Veinte poemas sold millions of copies and became Neruda's best-known work, though a second edition did not appear until 1932. Almost one hundred years later, Veinte Poemas still retains its place as the best-selling poetry book in the Spanish language. By the age of 20, Neruda had established an international reputation as a poet, but faced poverty. In 1926, he published the collection Tentativa del hombre infinito (The Attempt of the Infinite Man) and the novel El habitante y su esperanza (The Inhabitant and His Hope).Tarn (1975) p. 15 In 1927, out of financial desperation, he took an honorary consulship in Rangoon, the capital of the British colony of Burma, then administered from New Delhi as a province of British India. Rangoon was a place he had never heard of before. Later, mired in isolation and loneliness, he worked in Colombo (Ceylon), Batavia (Java), and Singapore. In Batavia the following year he met and married (6 December 1930) his first wife, a Dutch bank employee named Marijke Antonieta Hagenaar Vogelzang, known as Maruca. {{Mark Eisner : Pablo Neruda ‚Äì The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 190 While he was in the diplomatic service, Neruda read large amounts of verse, experimented with many different poetic forms, and wrote the first two volumes of Residencia en la Tierra, which includes many surrealist poems. Diplomatic and political career =Spanish Civil War= After returning to Chile, Neruda was given diplomatic posts in Buenos Aires and then Barcelona, Spain.Tarn (1975) p. 16 He later succeeded Gabriela Mistral as consul in Madrid, where he became the center of a lively literary circle, befriending such writers as Rafael Alberti, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, and the Peruvian poet C√©sar Vallejo. His only offspring, his daughter Malva Marina (Trinidad) Reyes, was born in Madrid in 1934. She was plagued with severe health problems, especially suffering from hydrocephalus.Feinstein (2005) p. 109 She died in 1943 (nine years old), having spent most of her short life with a foster family in the Netherlands after Neruda ignored and abandoned her, forcing her mother to take what jobs she could. Half that time was during the Nazi occupation of Holland, when for the Nazi mentality birth defects denoted genetic inferiority at best. During this period, Neruda became estranged from his wife and instead began a relationship with , an aristocratic Argentine artist who was twenty years his senior. Grave of Malva Marina, sole daughter of Pablo Neruda As Spain became engulfed in civil war, Neruda became intensely politicised for the first time. His experiences during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath moved him away from privately focused work in the direction of collective obligation. Neruda became an ardent Communist for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends, as well as that of del Carril, were contributing factors, but the most important catalyst was the execution of Garc√≠a Lorca by forces loyal to the dictator Francisco Franco. By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the Spanish Republic, publishing the collection Espa√±a en el coraz√≥n (Spain in Our Hearts, 1938). He lost his post as consul due to his political militancy. Neruda's marriage to Vogelzang broke down and Neruda eventually obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1943. His estranged wife moved to Monte Carlo to escape the hostilities in Spain and then to the Netherlands with their very ill only child, and he never saw either of them again.Feinstein (2005) p. 434 After leaving his wife, Neruda lived with Delia del Carril in France, eventually marrying her (shortly after his divorce) in Tetecala in 1943; however his new marriage was not recognized by Chilean authorities as his divorce from Vogelzang was deemed illegal.{{Mark Eisner : Pablo Neruda ‚Äì The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 306 Following the election of Pedro Aguirre Cerda (whom Neruda supported) as President of Chile in 1938, Neruda was appointed special Consul for Spanish emigrants in Paris. There he was responsible for what he called \\"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\\": transporting 2,000 Spanish refugees who had been housed by the French in squalid camps to Chile on an old ship called the Winnipeg.Feinstein (2005) p. 141 Neruda is sometimes charged with having selected only fellow Communists for emigration, to the exclusion of others who had fought on the side of the Republic.Feinstein (2005) p. 145 Many Republicans and Anarchists were killed during the German invasion and occupation. Others deny these accusations, pointing out that Neruda chose only a few hundred of the 2,000 refugees personally; the rest were selected by the Service for the Evacuation of Spanish Refugees set up by Juan Negr√≠n, President of the Spanish Republican Government in Exile. =Mexican appointment= Neruda's next diplomatic post was as Consul General in Mexico City from 1940 to 1943.Tarn (1975) p. 17 While he was there, he married del Carril, and learned that his daughter Malva had died, aged eight, in the Nazi- occupied Netherlands. In 1940, after the failure of an assassination attempt against Leon Trotsky, Neruda arranged a Chilean visa for the Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros, who was accused of having been one of the conspirators in the assassination.Feinstein (2005) p. 340 Neruda later said that he did it at the request of the Mexican President, Manuel √Åvila Camacho. This enabled Siqueiros, then jailed, to leave Mexico for Chile, where he stayed in Neruda's private residence. In exchange for Neruda's assistance, Siqueiros spent over a year painting a mural in a school in Chill√°n. Neruda's relationship with Siqueiros attracted criticism, but Neruda dismissed the allegation that his intent had been to help an assassin as \\"sensationalist politico-literary harassment\\". =Return to Chile= In 1943, after his return to Chile, Neruda made a tour of Peru, where he visited Machu Picchu,Feinstein (2005) p. 244 an experience that later inspired Alturas de Macchu Picchu, a book-length poem in twelve parts that he completed in 1945 and which expressed his growing awareness of, and interest in, the ancient civilizations of the Americas. He explored this theme further in Canto General (1950). In Alturas, Neruda celebrated the achievement of Machu Picchu, but also condemned the slavery that had made it possible. In Canto XII, he called upon the dead of many centuries to be born again and to speak through him. Mart√≠n Espada, poet and professor of creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has hailed the work as a masterpiece, declaring that \\"there is no greater political poem\\". =Communism= Bolstered by his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, Neruda, like many left-leaning intellectuals of his generation, came to admire the Soviet Union of Joseph Stalin, partly for the role it played in defeating Nazi Germany and partly because of an idealist interpretation of Marxist doctrine. This is echoed in poems such as \\"Canto a Stalingrado\\" (1942) and \\"Nuevo canto de amor a Stalingrado\\" (1943). In 1953, Neruda was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize. Upon Stalin's death that same year, Neruda wrote an ode to him, as he also wrote poems in praise of Fulgencio Batista, \\"Saludo a Batista\\" (\\"Salute to Batista\\"), and later to Fidel Castro. His fervent Stalinism eventually drove a wedge between Neruda and his long- time friend Octavio Paz, who commented that \\"Neruda became more and more Stalinist, while I became less and less enchanted with Stalin.\\"Roman, Joe. (1993) Octavio Paz Chelsea House Publishers Their differences came to a head after the Nazi-Soviet Ribbentrop‚ÄìMolotov Pact of 1939, when they almost came to blows in an argument over Stalin. Although Paz still considered Neruda \\"The greatest poet of his generation\\", in an essay on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn he wrote that when he thinks of \\"Neruda and other famous Stalinist writers and poets, I feel the gooseflesh that I get from reading certain passages of the Inferno. No doubt they began in good faith [...] but insensibly, commitment by commitment, they saw themselves becoming entangled in a mesh of lies, falsehoods, deceits and perjuries, until they lost their souls.\\"Paz, Octavio (1991) On Poets and Others. Arcade. p. 127 On 15 July 1945, at Pacaembu Stadium in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Neruda read to 100,000 people in honor of the Communist revolutionary leader Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes.Neruda, La vida del poeta: Cronolog√≠a, 1944‚Äì1953, Fundaci√≥n Neruda, University of Chile. Retrieved 29 December 2006. Neruda also called Vladimir Lenin the \\"great genius of this century\\", and in a speech he gave on 5 June 1946, he paid tribute to the late Soviet leader Mikhail Kalinin, who for Neruda was \\"man of noble life\\", \\"the great constructor of the future\\", and \\"a comrade in arms of Lenin and Stalin\\". Neruda later came to regret his fondness for the Soviet Union, explaining that \\"in those days, Stalin seemed to us the conqueror who had crushed Hitler's armies.\\"Feinstein (2005) pp. 312‚Äì313 Of a subsequent visit to China in 1957, Neruda wrote: \\"What has estranged me from the Chinese revolutionary process has not been Mao Tse-tung but Mao Tse-tungism.\\" He dubbed this Mao Tse- Stalinism: \\"the repetition of a cult of a Socialist deity.\\" Despite his disillusionment with Stalin, Neruda never lost his essential faith in Communist theory and remained loyal to \\"the Party\\". Anxious not to give ammunition to his ideological enemies, he would later refuse publicly to condemn the Soviet repression of dissident writers like Boris Pasternak and Joseph Brodsky, an attitude with which even some of his staunchest admirers disagreed.Feinstein (2005) p. 263 On 4 March 1945, Neruda was elected a Communist Senator for the northern provinces of Antofagasta and Tarapac√° in the Atacama Desert.Shull (2009) p. 69Feinstein (2005) p. 181 He officially joined the Communist Party of Chile four months later. In 1946, the Radical Party's presidential candidate, Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, asked Neruda to act as his campaign manager. Gonz√°lez Videla was supported by a coalition of left- wing parties and Neruda fervently campaigned on his behalf. Once in office, however, Gonz√°lez Videla turned against the Communist Party and issued the Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia (Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy). The breaking point for Senator Neruda was the violent repression of a Communist-led miners' strike in Lota in October 1947, when striking workers were herded into island military prisons and a concentration camp in the town of Pisagua. Neruda's criticism of Gonz√°lez Videla culminated in a dramatic speech in the Chilean senate on 6 January 1948, which became known as \\"Yo acuso\\" (\\"I accuse\\"), in the course of which he read out the names of the miners and their families who were imprisoned at the concentration camp.Feinstein (2005) p. 199 In 1959 Neruda was present as Fidel Castro was honored at a welcoming ceremony offered by the Central University of Venezuela where he spoke to a massive gathering of students and read his Canto a Bolivar. Luis B√°ez summarized what Neruda said: \\"In this painful and victorious hour that the peoples of America live, my poem with changes of place, can be understood directed to Fidel Castro, because in the struggles for freedom the fate of a Man to give confidence to the spirit of greatness in the history of our peoples\\". During the late 1960s, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was asked for his opinion of Pablo Neruda. Borges stated, \\"I think of him as a very fine poet, a very fine poet. I don't admire him as a man, I think of him as a very mean man.\\"Burgin (1968) p. 95. He said that Neruda had not spoken out against Argentine President Juan Per√≥n because he was afraid to risk his reputation, noting \\"I was an Argentine poet, he was a Chilean poet, he's on the side of the Communists; I'm against them. So I felt he was behaving very wisely in avoiding a meeting that would have been quite uncomfortable for both of us.\\"Burgin (1968) p. 96. Hiding and exile, 1948‚Äì1952 Neruda with his wife and Erich Honecker in 1951 A few weeks after his \\"Yo acuso\\" speech in 1948, finding himself threatened with arrest, Neruda went into hiding and he and his wife were smuggled from house to house hidden by supporters and admirers for the next thirteen months. While in hiding, Senator Neruda was removed from office and, in September 1948, the Communist Party was banned altogether under the Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia, called by critics the Ley Maldita (Accursed Law), which eliminated over 26,000 people from the electoral registers, thus stripping them of their right to vote. Neruda later moved to Valdivia, in southern Chile. From Valdivia he moved to Fundo Huishue, a forestry estate in the vicinity of Huishue Lake. Neruda's life underground ended in March 1949 when he fled over the Lilpela Pass in the Andes Mountains to Argentina on horseback. He would dramatically recount his escape from Chile in his Nobel Prize lecture. Once out of Chile, he spent the next three years in exile. In Buenos Aires, Neruda took advantage of the slight resemblance between him and his friend, the future Nobel Prize-winning novelist and cultural attach√© to the Guatemalan embassy Miguel √Ångel Asturias, to travel to Europe using Asturias' passport.Feinstein (2005) pp. 236‚Äì7 Pablo Picasso arranged his entrance into Paris and Neruda made a surprise appearance there to a stunned World Congress of Peace Forces, while the Chilean government denied that the poet could have escaped the country. Neruda spent those three years traveling extensively throughout Europe as well as taking trips to India, China, Sri Lanka and the Soviet Union. His trip to Mexico in late 1949 was lengthened due to a serious bout of phlebitis.Feinstein (2005) p. 290 A Chilean singer named Matilde Urrutia was hired to care for him and they began an affair that would, years later, culminate in marriage. During his exile, Urrutia would travel from country to country shadowing him and they would arrange meetings whenever they could. Matilde Urrutia was the muse for Los versos del capit√°n, a book of poetry which Neruda later published anonymously in 1952. While in Mexico, Neruda also published his lengthy epic poem Canto General, a Whitmanesque catalog of the history, geography, and flora and fauna of South America, accompanied by Neruda's observations and experiences. Many of them dealt with his time underground in Chile, which is when he composed much of the poem. In fact, he had carried the manuscript with him during his escape on horseback. A month later, a different edition of five thousand copies was boldly published in Chile by the outlawed Communist Party based on a manuscript Neruda had left behind. In Mexico, he was granted honorary Mexican citizenship.Tarn (1975) p. 22 Neruda's 1952 stay in a villa owned by Italian historian Edwin Cerio on the island of Capri was fictionalized in Antonio Skarmeta's 1985 novel Ardiente Paciencia (Ardent Patience, later known as El cartero de Neruda, or Neruda's Postman), which inspired the popular film Il Postino (1994).Feinstein (2005) p. 278 Second return to Chile Neruda recording his poetry at the U.S. Library of Congress in 1966 By 1952, the Gonz√°lez Videla government was on its last legs, weakened by corruption scandals. The Chilean Socialist Party was in the process of nominating Salvador Allende as its candidate for the September 1952 presidential elections and was keen to have the presence of Neruda, by now Chile's most prominent left-wing literary figure, to support the campaign. Neruda returned to Chile in August of that year and rejoined Delia del Carril, who had traveled ahead of him some months earlier, but the marriage was crumbling. Del Carril eventually learned of his affair with Matilde Urrutia and he sent her back to Chile in 1955. She convinced the Chilean officials to lift his arrest, allowing Urrutia and Neruda to go to Capri, Italy. Now united with Urrutia, Neruda would, aside from many foreign trips and a stint as Allende's ambassador to France from 1970 to 1973, spend the rest of his life in Chile. By this time, Neruda enjoyed worldwide fame as a poet, and his books were being translated into virtually all the major languages of the world. He vigorously denounced the United States during the Cuban Missile Crisis and later in the decade he likewise repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its involvement in the Vietnam War. But being one of the most prestigious and outspoken left-wing intellectuals alive, he also attracted opposition from ideological opponents. The Congress for Cultural Freedom, an anti-communist organization covertly established and funded by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, adopted Neruda as one of its primary targets and launched a campaign to undermine his reputation, reviving the old claim that he had been an accomplice in the attack on Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940.Feinstein (2005) p. 487 The campaign became more intense when it became known that Neruda was a candidate for the 1964 Nobel Prize, which was eventually awarded to Jean-Paul SartreFeinstein (2005) pp. 334‚Äì5 (who rejected it). La Sebastiana, Neruda's house in Valpara√≠so In 1966, Neruda was invited to attend an International PEN conference in New York City.Feinstein (2005) pp. 341‚Äì5 Officially, he was barred from entering the U.S. because he was a communist, but the conference organizer, playwright Arthur Miller, eventually prevailed upon the Johnson Administration to grant Neruda a visa. Neruda gave readings to packed halls, and even recorded some poems for the Library of Congress. Miller later opined that Neruda's adherence to his communist ideals of the 1930s was a result of his protracted exclusion from \\"bourgeois society\\". Due to the presence of many Eastern Bloc writers, Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes later wrote that the PEN conference marked a \\"beginning of the end\\" of the Cold War. Upon Neruda's return to Chile, he stopped in Peru, where he gave readings to enthusiastic crowds in Lima and Arequipa and was received by President Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry. However, this visit also prompted an unpleasant backlash; because the Peruvian government had come out against the government of Fidel Castro in Cuba, July 1966 saw more than one hundred Cuban intellectuals retaliate against the poet by signing a letter that charged Neruda with colluding with the enemy, calling him an example of the \\"tepid, pro-Yankee revisionism\\" then prevalent in Latin America. The affair was particularly painful for Neruda because of his previous outspoken support for the Cuban revolution, and he never visited the island again, even after receiving an invitation in 1968. After the death of Che Guevara in Bolivia in 1967, Neruda wrote several articles regretting the loss of a \\"great hero\\".Feinstein (2005) p. 326 At the same time, he told his friend Aida Figueroa not to cry for Che, but for Luis Emilio Recabarren, the father of the Chilean communist movement, who preached a pacifist revolution over Che's violent ways. Last years and death La Chascona, Neruda's house in Santiago In 1970, Neruda was nominated as a candidate for the Chilean presidency, but ended up giving his support to Salvador Allende, who later won the election and was inaugurated in 1970 as Chile's first democratically elected socialist head of state.Feinstein (2005) p. 367 Shortly thereafter, Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France, lasting from 1970‚Äì1972; his final diplomatic posting. During his stint in Paris, Neruda helped to renegotiate the external debt of Chile, billions owed to European and American banks, but within months of his arrival in Paris his health began to deteriorate. Neruda returned to Chile two and a half years later due to his failing health. Buenos Aires 1971 In 1971, Neruda was awarded the Nobel Prize, a decision that did not come easily because some of the committee members had not forgotten Neruda's past praise of Stalinist dictatorship. But his Swedish translator, Artur Lundkvist, did his best to ensure the Chilean received the prize.Feinstein (2005) p. 333 \\"A poet,\\" Neruda stated in his Stockholm speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize, \\"is at the same time a force for solidarity and for solitude.\\"Pablo Neruda (1994). Late and posthumous poems, 1968‚Äì1974. Grove Press. The following year Neruda was awarded the prestigious Golden Wreath Award at the Struga Poetry Evenings. As the coup d'√©tat of 1973 unfolded, Neruda was diagnosed with prostate cancer. The military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet saw Neruda's hopes for Chile destroyed. Shortly thereafter, during a search of the house and grounds at Isla Negra by Chilean armed forces at which Neruda was reportedly present, the poet famously remarked: \\"Look around ‚Äì there's only one thing of danger for you here ‚Äì poetry.\\"Feinstein (2005) p. 413 Neruda laid out in his coffin, 1973 It was originally reported that, on the evening of 23 September 1973, at Santiago's Santa Mar√≠a Clinic, Neruda had died of heart failure;\\"Pablo Neruda, Nobel Poet, Dies in a Chilean Hospital\\", The New York Times, 24 September 1973.Neruda and Vallejo: Selected Poems, Robert Bly, ed.; Beacon Press, Boston, 1993, p. xii.Earth-Shattering Poems, Liz Rosenberg, ed.; Henry Holt, New York, 1998, p. 105. However, ‚Äú(t)hat day, he was alone in the hospital where he had already spent five days. His health was declining and he called his wife, Matilde Urrutia, so she could come immediately because they were giving him something and he wasn‚Äôt feeling good.\\" On 12 May 2011, the Mexican magazine Proceso published an interview with his former driver Manuel Araya Osorio in which he states that he was present when Neruda called his wife and warned that he believed Pinochet had ordered a doctor to kill him, and that he had just been given an injection in his stomach. He would die six and a half hours later. Even reports from the pro-Pinochet El Mercurio newspaper the day after Neruda's death refer to an injection given immediately before Neruda's death. According to an official Chilean Interior Ministry report prepared in March 2015 for the court investigation into Neruda‚Äôs death, \\"he was either given an injection or something orally\\" at the Santa Mar√≠a Clinic \\"which caused his death six-and-a-half hours later. The 1971 Nobel laureate was scheduled to fly to Mexico where he may have been planning to lead a government in exile that would denounce General Augusto Pinochet, who led the coup against Allende on September 11, according to his friends, researchers and other political observers\\". The funeral took place amidst a massive police presence, and mourners took advantage of the occasion to protest against the new regime, established just a couple of weeks before. Neruda's house was broken into and his papers and books taken or destroyed. In 1974, his Memoirs appeared under the title I Confess I Have Lived, updated to the last days of the poet's life, and including a final segment describing the death of Salvador Allende during the storming of the Moneda Palace by General Pinochet and other generals ‚Äì occurring only twelve days before Neruda died. Matilde Urrutia subsequently compiled and edited for publication the memoirs and possibly his final poem \\"Right Comrade, It's the Hour of the Garden\\". These and other activities brought her into conflict with Pinochet's government, which continually sought to curtail Neruda's influence on the Chilean collective consciousness. Urrutia's own memoir, My Life with Pablo Neruda, was published posthumously in 1986. Manuel Araya, his Communist Party-appointed chauffeur, published a book about Neruda's final days in 2012.  Controversy  =Rumored murder and exhumation= In June 2013, a Chilean judge ordered that an investigation be launched, following suggestions that Neruda had been killed by the Pinochet regime for his pro-Allende stance and political views. Neruda's driver, Manuel Araya, stated that doctors had administered poison as the poet was preparing to go into exile. In December 2011, Chile's Communist Party asked Chilean Judge Mario Carroza to order the exhumation of the remains of the poet. Carroza had been conducting probes into hundreds of deaths allegedly connected to abuses of Pinochet's regime from 1973 to 1990. Carroza's inquiry during 2011‚Äì12 uncovered enough evidence to order the exhumation in April 2013. Eduardo Contreras, a Chilean lawyer who was leading the push for a full investigation, commented: \\"We have world-class labs from India, Switzerland, Germany, the US, Sweden, they have all offered to do the lab work for free.\\" The Pablo Neruda Foundation fought the exhumation under the grounds that the Araya's claims were unbelievable. In June 2013 a court order was issued to find the man who allegedly poisoned Neruda. Police were investigating Michael Townley, who was facing trial for the killings of General Carlos Prats (Buenos Aires, 1974), and ex Chancellor Orlando Letelier (Washington, 1976).Washington Post, 2 June 2013, \\"Chilean judge issues order to investigate poet Neruda's alleged killer\\" The Chilean government suggested that the 2015 test showed it was ‚Äúhighly probable that a third party‚Äù was responsible for his death. Test results were released on 8 November 2013 of the seven-month investigation by a 15-member forensic team. Patricio Bustos, the head of Chile's medical legal service, stated \\"No relevant chemical substances have been found that could be linked to Mr. Neruda's death\\" at the time.\\"Forensic tests show no poison in remains of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda\\" 8 November 2013 Washington Post. However, Carroza said that he was waiting for the results of the last scientific tests conducted in May (2015), which found that Neruda was infected with the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium, which can be highly toxic and result in death if modified. A team of 16 international experts led by Spanish forensic specialist Aurelio Luna from the University of Murcia announced on 20 October 2017 that \\"from analysis of the data we cannot accept that the poet had been in an imminent situation of death at the moment of entering the hospital\\" and that death from prostate cancer was not likely at the moment when he died. The team also discovered something in Neruda's remains that could possibly be a laboratory-cultivated bacteria. The results of their continuing analysis were expected in 2018. Reuters. His cause of death was in fact listed as a heart attack. Scientists who exhumed Neruda's body in 2013 also backed claims that he was suffering from prostate cancer when he died as well. =Rape admissions and feminist protests= In November 2018 the Cultural Committee of Chile's lower house voted in favour of renaming Santiago's main airport after Neruda. The decision sparked protests from feminist groups, who highlighted a passage in Neruda's memoirs in which he describes raping a maid in Ceylon in 1929. Several feminist groups, bolstered by a growing #MeToo and anti-femicide movement stated that Neruda should not be honoured by his country. Today Neruda remains a controversial figure for Chileans, and especially for Chilean feminists.

He created the gisant figures of the two deceased children of Charles VIII of France on their monument (1506) in Tours Cathedral. However, his most important surviving works were for the magnificent tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany, in Nantes Cathedral (1502‚Äì1507), and for the mausoleum of Philibert II of Savoy, at Notre-Dame de Brou, his masterwork. The Francis II monument was designed by Jean Perr√©al; it was disassembled and buried for safekeeping during the French Revolution.(Nantes Cathedral) Le tombeau de Fran√ßois II An Entombment at the Abbey of Solesmes (1494‚Äì1498) is attributed to him.

Volcano Mountain is called Nelr√∫na in the Northern Tutchone language. Geology Volcano Mountain is the youngest volcano in the Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field and one of the youngest in the northern section of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. The lava at Volcano Mountain is olivine nephelinite, which is an uncommon type of lava. This type of lava is believed to have come from much deeper inside the Earth than basaltic lava. The last eruption from Volcano Mountain produced young nephelinitic lava flows that remain unvegetated and appear to be only a few hundred years old. However, dating of sediments in lake impounded by the lava flows indicate that the youngest flows could not be younger than mid-Holocene and could be early Holocene or older. Volcanic hazards Future eruptions from Volcano Mountain would probably be lava flows, since there is a lack of pyroclastic material. The main hazards from Volcano Mountain are forest fires started by the lava flows and poisonous gases. Older volcanic deposits south of Volcano Mountain indicate that lava flows may have once partly blocked or at least altered the course of the Yukon and Pelly Rivers. Any future activity in this area could disrupt the course of both of these major rivers and could have a serious impact on people living or working downstream.

The Court of Appeal held that a defendant can be deemed liable for all consequences flowing from his negligent conduct regardless of how unforeseeable such consequences are. The case is an example of strict liability, a concept which has generally fallen out of favour with the common law courts. The case may now be considered \\"bad law\\", having been superseded by the landmark decisions of Donoghue v Stevenson and The Wagon Mound (No 1). Facts The defendant stevedore's employees were loading cargo into a ship. An employee negligently caused a plank to fall into the ship's hold. The plank caused a spark, which ignited some petrol vapour in the hold, causing an explosion that resulted in the ship becoming a total loss. The matter was taken to arbitration. Judgment The arbitrator held that the consequences of the spark could not have been anticipated and therefore no liability arose. The claimant appealed. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant was liable. Although the fire itself may not have been foreseeable, it was held that the defendant would nevertheless be liable for all direct consequences of his actions. The court reasoned that if the act would or might probably cause damage, the fact that the damage it in fact causes is not the exact kind of damage one would expect is immaterial, so long as the damage is in fact directly traceable to the negligent act and not due to the operation of independent causes. Significance Although the stevedore would have foreseen that careless loading might cause some damage to the workers, cargo, or the ship, it was beyond probability that the actual total loss would occur, yet the defendant was held fully liable. The Re Polemis decision was disapproved of, and its test replaced, in the later decision of the Privy Council in the Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961].Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961] 1 All E.R. 404 (P.C.) Re Polemis has yet to be overruled by an English court and is still technically \\"good law\\". However, it was disapproved by the Privy Council, whose decisions are not binding but are strongly persuasive on English courts. The upshot is that the strict liability principle in Re Polemis has not been followed, and the case may be considered \\"bad law\\". Street on Torts *The move away from strict liability meant that it was more likely that a defendant would not be liable, and the Scots court in Hughes v Lord Advocate tried to find a middle way. It created the concept of \\"foreseeability of the class of harm\\"; that is, one need not foresee the actual harm, provided one could foresee a \\"class of harm\\" into which the unforeseeable result fell. Happily, this allowed two young boys who had suffered burns to be compensated; but in the English case of Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Case report Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company [1964] 1 QB 518the claimant was less favoured: this factory worker who was injured in an eruption when a fellow employee careless dropped a lid into a vat of hot liquid was unable to recover as the court held that whist \\"splashing\\" was foreseeable, the actual \\"eruption\\" fell outside the \\"foreseeable class of harm\\". * Since 1932, defendants will be liable in negligence only if could have been foreseen that the breach of the duty of care towards the claimant would cause loss, damage or injury. An exception that still applies is the talem qualem rule, (or \\"eggshell skull rule\\"), which means \\"you take your victim as you find him\\"; but this applies ONLY to personal injury, as in Smith v Leech Brain.Smith v Leech Brain [1962] 2 QB 405 See also *English tort law * Negligence per se *Palsgraf v.

Eruption information  This Holocene volcano erupted in the year 2220 ¬± 300 years B.C. When Dotsero blew, it created small scoria cones that were constructed along a NNE-SSW line on either side of the maar. The eruption date is based upon radiocarbon dating of wood found underneath some of the scoria.

The bridge links the Grafton central business district with South Grafton, and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. A parallel New Grafton Bridge, located east of the original bridge and initially consisting of two lanes, opened to traffic on 12 December 2019.  History  A bridge over the Clarence River in Grafton was first conceived in 1915. The original design called for a railway bridge with a footway, but in 1922 the design was changed to accommodate vehicular traffic as well. The bridge was built from 1927 to 1932, although planning for the bridge had been under way as early as 1921. The bridge was designed and built by the New South Wales Public Works Department with steelwork from Clyde Engineering. The department decided to construct the bridge itself after being unhappy with the high cost proposed by private tenderers for the project. It was formally opened by Governor-General of Australia Sir Isaac Isaacs on 19 July 1932.  First bridge  The upper level of the bridge supports a two way road for traffic via Bent Street (Summerland Way), and its lower level supports a rail bridge that carries the North Coast railway line, a water main, and footbridges on either side. There is provision for a second track across the bridge but at this time it is being used as an easement for a water main. The bascule span was operational from its opening in 1932 until 1969. The bascule can no longer be raised due to an added water main. With the decline in shipping along the Clarence River, the opening span was sealed shut and it can no longer be opened. The bridge heritage listing also includes the three remnant spans of the 1915 timber viaduct south of Grafton railway station, which now remain in situ amidst parkland. = Heritage listing = This bridge is a double-deck road/rail structure, the only one of its type in New South Wales. There is a lift span to allow passing of river traffic that is no longer in use. The bridge presents a commanding visual reminder of rail and road to residents of Grafton. Opening of the bridge in 1932 completed the North coast standard gauge line between Sydney and Brisbane, avoiding the winding route via Tenterfield. The viaduct along with the wharf remains are important relics of the development of the north coast railway. The viaduct is representative of similar structures constructed at a range of locations, many of which have been replaced. The Grafton Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.  Second bridge  In 2002, the NSW Government commissioned a study into an additional crossing over Clarence River, released in early 2003. In October 2008, federal, state and local government representatives inspected the existing bridge. It was claimed that this bridge was not coping with the increasing volume of traffic. Estimates of replacing the bridge were in the range of 100 million. In December 2012, the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) announced that a preferred option of an additional crossing of the Clarence River had been identified and went on public display for comment. RMS also announced that a final decision was expected during 2013. Construction commenced on the new crossing, known as New Grafton Bridge, in November 2016 and the bridge was opened on 12 December 2019 by Chris Gulaptis, the Member for Clarence. The New Grafton Bridge consists of two lanes and has been designed to be increased to four lanes when traffic levels require it. The bridge also carries a grade- separated footpath and cycleway.

It connects NY 23A in the village of Hunter with NY 23 near the Windham hamlet of Hensonville. The route follows a mountainous track between the two locations, climbing up from the Schoharie Creek valley before descending again into the Batavia Kill watershed. NY 296 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, the highway had been state-maintained since the early 1910s. Route description NY 296 heading north through Hunter on a winter morning NY 296 begins at an intersection with NY 23A (Main Street) along the banks of Schoharie Creek just west of the village of Hunter in the town of Hunter. Located within the Catskill Forest Preserve, NY 296 passes the small Hunter Airport, where views of Rusk Mountain are visible. Winding into the town of Jewett, NY 296 is a two-lane asphalt roadway running through the Catskills. Near the junction with Beaches Corners Road, the route turns northwest, paralleling the East Kill, before crossing the waterway a short distance later. Just after crossing the East Kill, NY 296 crosses Beaches Corners Road one more time before intersecting with County Route 23C (CR 23C), which proceeds east towards NY 23A and west towards the hamlet of Jewett. NY 296 continues northeast after CR 23, passing a local church near the junction with Peck Road. The route proceeds due north after Peck Road, quickly entering a junction with CR 14 (Goshen Street), which merges into the state highway. NY 296 winds through the Catskills past Thomas Cole Mountain. After winding down the side of the mountain, NY 296 enters the hamlet of Hensonville, located adjacent to Batavia Kill, a tributary of Schoharie Creek. Here, the route intersects with the western terminus of CR 40 (Maple Crest Road). At this junction, NY 296 turns northwest on the CR 40 right-of-way, while CR 65 (Brooksburg Road) continues north towards NY 23. Leaving Hensonville, NY 296 continues northwest along Batavia Kill, serving a line of homes on the fringe of the hamlet. Crossing into the town of Windham, the route intersects with CR 12 (South Street) before turning north and crossing Batavia Kill to reach its north end at a junction with NY 23 just east of downtown Windham. History The origins of NY 296 date back to the early 1910s when the highway was improved by the state of New York over the course of two separate projects. On February 19, 1910, the state awarded a contract to rebuild of roads in Windham, including the northernmost of what is now NY 296\\\\. The reconstructed highways were added to the state highway system on January 5, 1911, as State Highway 797 (SH 797). The remainder of modern NY 296 was improved under a contract let on April 25, 1912, and accepted into the state highway system on December 19, 1913, as SH 998\\\\. Both state highway numbers are unsigned. NY 296 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to its current alignment.

Kelser finished his career at Michigan State as a 2-time Academic All- American, something he credits Jud Heathcote for keeping him on task to achieve. He was the very first Big-10 player, and remains the only player in Spartan Basketball history, to score over 2,000 points with over 1,000 rebounds.http://www.msuspartans.com/genrel/022208aaa.html NBA career He was drafted by the Pistons in 1979, but was later traded to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Vinnie Johnson in 1981. Kelser also spent a season with the San Diego Clippers and part of a season with the Indiana Pacers. Kelser noted that Larry Bird brutally went after Kelser whenever one of Kelser's teams played Boston, surmising that this was because Kelser's Michigan State team beat Bird's Indiana State Sycamores for the 1979 title; Kelser also said that he never sought or wanted to have a friendly relationship with Bird (Bird said when asked for a response that he didn't recall Kelser ever doing anything of note in the NBA). Post-NBA career Since leaving the NBA, Kelser has worked extensively as a sports announcer and/or commentator on radio and television. He is a commentator for Pistons games on Fox Sports Detroit with his partner George Blaha and on the Big Ten Network. Personal life Kelser, who likes to diversify his activities, has had many interests away from basketball, including collecting soul and jazz records, fishing for silver bass and walleye, playing softball, criminal law, with a special interest in juvenile delinquents, and he has worked in a Lansing, Michigan television station in which he and Magic Johnson had a vested interest.USA Today.

After revolting and killing the Safavid Persian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan in April 1709, he declared the Loy Kandahar (\\"Greater Kandahar\\") region in what is now southern Afghanistan independent. He is widely known as Mƒ´rwais Nƒ´k…ô (ŸÖŸäÿ±ŸàŸäÿ≥ ŸÜŸä⁄©Ÿá) or Mƒ´rwais BƒÅbƒÅ (ŸÖŸäÿ±ŸàŸäÿ≥ ÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿß, \\"Mirwais the father\\") in the Pashto language.http://www.beepworld.de/members4/wolas/mirwaisneeka.htm Rise to power In 1707, Kandahar was in a state of chaos, fought over by the Shi'a Safavid state of Persia and the Sunni Mughal state of India. Mirwais Khan, a Sunni tribal chief whose influence with his fellow-countrymen made him an object of suspicion, was held as a political prisoner by Gurgin Khan, the Persian governor in the region, who then sent him to the Safavid court at Isfahan. He was later freed and even allowed to meet with the Shah, Sultan Husayn, on a regular basis. Having ingratiated himself with the Persian court, Mirwais sought and obtained permission to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca in the Ottoman Empire (after which he was known as Hajji). At that time the once powerful Safavids were declining politically and militarily, riven by internal strife, royal intrigues, and endless wars against their arch rivals, the Ottomans. During his time in Persia, Mirwais tried to learn all the military weaknesses of the Safavids. The Greater Kandahar region (Candahar) during the Safavid dynasty and Mughal period While in Mecca, he sought a fatwa from the leading religious authorities against the foreign rulers who were persecuting his people in his homeland. The Pashtun tribes rankled under the ruling Safavids because of their continued attempts to forcefully convert them from Sunni to Shia Islam. The fatwa was granted and he carried it with him to I·π£fahan and subsequently to Kandahar, with permission to return and strong recommendations to Gurgin Khan. He began organizing his countrymen for a major uprising, and in April 1709, when a large part of the Persian garrison was on an expedition outside the city, he and his followers fell on the remainder and killed the majority of them, including Gurgin Khan. With the death of Gurgin Khan, the Hotaki soldiers took control of the city and then the province. Mirwais entered Kandahar and made an important speech to its inhabitants: Mirwais and his forces then defeated a large Persian army that was sent to regain control over the area. Mirwais Khan became the governor of the Greater Kandahar region. To the northwest were the Abdali Pashtuns and to the east lay the Moghul Empire. Refusing the title of king, Mirwais was referred to as \\"Prince of Qandah√°r and General of the national troops\\" by his Afghan countrymen. Death and legacy The mausoleum of Mirwais Hotak in the Kokaran section of Kandahar, Afghanistan. Mirwais remained in power until his death in November 1715 and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was later killed by Mirwais' son Mahmud, allegedly for planning to give Kandahar's sovereignty back to Persia. In 1717, Mahmud took advantage of the political weakness of the Persian Shah (Sultan Husayn) and briefly conquered large parts Persia. Mirwais is buried in his mausoleum in the Kokaran section of Kandahar, which is in the western end of the city. He is regarded as one of Afghanistan's greatest national heroes and admired by many Afghans, especially the Pashtuns. Steven Otfinoski referred to him as Afghanistan's George Washington in his 2004 book Afghanistan. There is a neighborhood called Mirwais Mina as well as a hospital called Mirwais Hospital, a high school and a business center named after him in Kandahar. There are also schools and a number of institutions or places across Afghanistan built to honor him. A few direct descendants of Mirwais are living today among the Hotak tribe.

Born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt, he is currently distinguished professor at the Graduate Center of City University of New York, where he teaches the history of literary theory and the works of Marcel Proust. Aciman previously taught creative writing at New York University and French literature at Princeton and Bard College. In 2009, he was Visiting Distinguished Writer at Wesleyan University. He is the author of several novels, including Call Me by Your Name (winner, in the Gay Fiction category, of the 2007 Lambda Literary Award and made into a film) and a 1995 memoir, Out of Egypt, which won a Whiting Award. Although best known for Call Me by Your Name, Aciman stated in an interview in 2019 that his best book is the novel Eight White Nights. Early life and education Aciman in 2009 Aciman reads Find Me in 2019 Aciman was born in Alexandria, Egypt, the son of Regine and Henri N. Aciman, who owned a knitting factory. His mother was deaf. Aciman was raised in a French-speaking home where family members also spoke Italian, Greek, Ladino, and Arabic. His parents were Sephardic Jews, of Turkish and Italian origin, from families that had settled in Alexandria in 1905. As members of one of the Mutamassirun (\\"foreign\\") communities, his family members were unable to become Egyptian citizens. As a child, Aciman mistakenly believed that he was a French citizen. He attended British schools in Egypt. His family was spared from the 1956‚Äì57 exodus and expulsions from Egypt. However, increased tensions with Israel under President Gamal Abdel Nasser put Jews in a precarious position and his family left Egypt nine years later in 1965. After his father purchased Italian citizenship for the family, Aciman moved with his mother and brother as refugees to Rome while his father moved to Paris. They moved to New York City in 1968. He earned a B.A. in English and Comparative Literature from Lehman College in 1973, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Harvard University in 1988. Out of Egypt Aciman's 1996 memoir Out of Egypt was reviewed widely. In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani described the book as a \\"remarkable memoir...that leaves the reader with a mesmerizing portrait of a now vanished world.\\" She compared his work with that of Lawrence Durrell and noted, \\"There are some wonderfully vivid scenes here, as strange and marvelous as something in Garc√≠a M√°rquez, as comical and surprising as something in Chekhov.\\"  Personal life  Aciman is married to Susan Wiviott. They have three sons, Alexander and twins Philip and Michael. His wife Susan, a Wisconsin alumna and Harvard Law graduate, is the CEO of the Bridge, Inc., a NYC-based NPO that offers rehabilitative services.

Part of the Grupo Bandeirantes de Comunica√ß√£o, it aired for the first time in 1967. Currently it is the fourth TV network in Brazil by the ratings.  History  Rede Bandeirantes was founded on May 13, 1967, by Jo√£o Saad, nephew of S√£o Paulo state governor Ademar de Barros and owner of R√°dio Bandeirantes. In 1969 the main TV building suffered a massive fire, which forced Saad to replace his broadcasting equipment. By 1972, TV Bandeirantes was the first Brazilian television network to broadcast fully in color, the same year that Rede Globo did the same. Later in the 1970s Bandeirantes became a national broadcasting network, helped partly by the hit Saturday afternoon program Clube do Bolinha, the Japan-theme program Japan Pop Show and a 2nd wave of drama programs which started in 1979. Walter Clark took over the network in 1982 and remodeled the station's programming after Rede Globo, while the network's present logo debuted that same year, with Cyro Del Nero as its designer. The logo was also shown nationwide given the fact that it ‚Äì together with Rede Globo ‚Äì had also at the same time begun nationwide satellite broadcasting as well. This was also the same year that the network began an 18-year tradition of broadcasting the biannual electoral debates at the local levels. In 2007, the network launched a digital over-the-air feed in S√£o Paulo. In 2008, Band began to have the support of the Argentinean production company Cuatro Cabezas. Since then, the station has gained more ratings and media attention, thanks to the comedy show CQC - Custe o Que Custar and later to other Cuatro-Cabezas-produced shows. In 2012, the founder and head of the production company, Diego Guebel, became artistic director of the network. With his direction, Band enjoyed a new growth of ratings; those responsible for this new achievement were the shows P√¢nico na Band - comedy show with the cast of former P√¢nico na TV, on RedeTV!, Quem Fica em P√©? - Brazilian version of Who's Still Standing? - and MasterChef. = Programming = See also * Torre TV Bandeirantes * BandNews * BandSports References External links * Official web site  Category:Television stations in Brazil Category:Companies based in S√£o Paulo Category:Television networks in Brazil Category:Portuguese-language television networks Category:Television channels and stations established in 1967 Category:Mass media in S√£o Paulo Category:1967 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Rede Bandeirantes"},{"id":"7673619","text":"The unnamed album (known colloquially as Black Album (, Chorny albom, and sometimes just named Kino) is the eighth and final studio album of the Soviet rock group Kino.

He is supported by a senior management team composed of: Allison Dewar, MaryJane Hunter, Graeme Nolan and Claire O'Neill  History  Founded in 1849, Airdrie Academy exists today in its third incarnation. The Academy moved to its current site on South Commonhead Avenue in 1941. When it was built in the midst of World War II, the new building cost a little over ¬£100,000 at the time. It was first located on Cairnhill Road in a building that housed Alexandra Primary School. The original building has since been demolished to make way for housing. Former building =Grammar school= From its inception, Airdrie Academy was the senior secondary school in Airdrie: pupils who did not pass an exam on leaving primary school would go to the now defunct Airdrie High. =Comprehensive= This system changed in the late 1960s when it became a full six-year comprehensive, nearly tripling the school roll to 1800. To cope with the increase the South Commonhead Avenue site's existing 'A-Block' was expanded into a larger campus with specific buildings for Science and Technology and a fourth 'House Block' with six dining halls and three floors of modern classrooms. Though enhanced and expanded over the years, the building fell into disrepair with students having to be taught in portable buildings during the early 2000s whilst asbestos was removed from the Science Block. After 60 years of service, the building was reaching the end of its serviceable life and North Lanarkshire Council began exploring alternatives. In December 1988 there was a meningitis outbreak, resulting in the death of a 40-year-old teacher. =New building= Aerial view of the modern campus, 2017 Vigorous lobbying from the school's pupils, teaching staff and the local MSP stopped the school from merging with Caldervale High in a proposed super-campus with over 2000 pupils. Instead, parents and pupils were invited to select a design for a new Airdrie Academy to be built on the playing fields of its current site. The selected design - similar to most other new schools in the county - was completed in October 2006 and is considerably smaller. The new building cost ¬£26 million. Over the remaining academic year, the old buildings were demolished and the land prepared for new sports fields. During this time one wing of the old A-Block was set on fire by vandals. Demolition moved on and in January 2007 the 'Dome' part of the old building was pulled down...

Interested in politics, he was a Democratic presidential elector in 1852, supporting Franklin Pierce's candidacy. Quarles helped incorporate Stewart College in 1856. He was the state's bank inspector in 1858 and was judge of the circuit court for a year, filling in for an ill incumbent. Quarles was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Congress from Tennessee in 1858. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in both 1856 and 1860. Quarles joined the Freemasons and became a Master Mason in 1856. He was appointed President of the Memphis, Clarksville and Louisville Railway Company, and helped oversee the construction of railroad lines in Tennessee and Kentucky. His brother, James Minor Quarles, was a United States Congressman representing Tennessee from 1859 until 1861 when the state seceded from the Union. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, Quarles organized the 42nd Tennessee Infantry and was commissioned on November 28, 1861, as its first colonel. His brother James would serve under Quarles for the rest of the war. In February 1862, Quarles and his men were present at the Battle of Fort Donelson, where they were among the thousands of men forced to surrender. He was sent north to the Johnson's Island prisoner-of-war camp in Ohio. After being sent to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in early August 1862 and formally exchanged, Quarles resumed command of his regiment. Quarles was promoted on August 25, 1863, to brigadier general and given command of a brigade initially consisting of the 42nd, 46th, 48th, and 53rd Tennessee infantry regiments, serving in the division of Edward C. Walthall. Later augmented by two regiments from Louisiana, another from Tennessee, and an artillery battery, Quarles' brigade missed the Chattanooga Campaign as his brigade did not arrive in time for the defense of Missionary Ridge. He was ordered back to Mississippi after it seemed certain that Braxton Bragg's army would not be attacked again after retreating to Dalton, Georgia, but he and his men returned to Georgia after the start of the Atlanta Campaign. At Pickett's Mill, Quarles was severely wounded. After recovering, Quarles led his brigade into Tennessee when army commander John Bell Hood moved northward from Atlanta. He was wounded on November 30, 1864, at the Battle of Franklin while leading his brigade against the Union works, and two weeks later captured while recuperating from his wound in a nearby field hospital. Quarles spent the rest of the war as a Union prisoner. He was finally paroled and exchanged at Nashville in May 1865 following the cessation of hostilities. Postbellum Following the war, Quarles resumed his law career in Clarksville and was a trustee of the Tennessee Orphans Society in 1867. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and continued his Masonic activities, becoming a Royal Arch Mason in 1865 and joining the Knights Templar in 1871. He was again a presidential elector in 1872, supporting Horace Greeley in his unsuccessful candidacy. Resuming his own political career, Quarles failed to garner enough support for the United States Senate in 1874, finishing well behind former President Andrew Johnson in balloting in the Tennessee legislature. He was subsequently elected to the State Senate, serving in the 39th (1875‚Äì77) and 45th (1887‚Äì89) General Assemblies. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1880 and 1884 and served on Democratic State Executive Committee in 1882. Quarles was married three times--first to a cousin, Miss Poindexter, then to Alice Vivian, and the third marriage to yet another cousin, Mrs. Louisa (Meriwether) Barker, daughter of Dr. Charles Hunter Meriwether. Quarles had one son, William A. Quarles died at his father-in-law's estate, \\"Meriville,\\" in Todd County, Kentucky, and was buried in Flat Lick Presbyterian Church graveyard, Christian County, Kentucky.

The ship was built in 1921 by the New York Shipbuilding Corp., of Camden, New Jersey, as SS Blue Hen State, but was renamed President Garfield in 1923 and then SS President Madison in 1940 for service with American President Lines. Acquired by the Navy from the War Shipping Administration on 11 April 1942 the ship was commissioned as the transport USS Kenmore until conversion to a hospital ship. Construction Blue Hen State was an Emergency Fleet Corporation Design 1095 passenger/cargo design more frequently known in the industry as the \\"502\\" type for the design length of between perpendiculars. The design had been for troop transports until signing of the armistice ending World War I made completion as civilian passenger and cargo ships desirable. New York Shipbuilding had the contract for all seven of the \\"502\\" class and nine of the \\"535\\" class, an order requiring expansion and construction of the company's South Yard, that were to be delivered to the United States Shipping Board (USSB). The design specifications for the seven ships were for combined passenger and cargo ships with elaborate accommodations for 78 passengers served by a crew of 115 and a bale cargo capacity of of which was cargo cold storage. Blue Hen State, along with Centennial State, was modified during completion to carry several hundred steerage passengers. Merchant service Blue Hen State, named after a nickname for Delaware, was renamed President Garfield by the USSB in 1922 in a mass renaming of the previously \\"State\\"-named ships. She was transferred to Dollar Line in 1923. On 26 August 1925, she ran aground at Nantucket, Massachusetts, but was refloated the next day. Dollar Line ship SS President Garfield in the Hunters' Point Dry Dock, San Francisco, California in 1932 President Garfield was sold in 1926 to Dollar Line. On 1 June 1928, she rammed the American cargo ship in the Atlantic Ocean off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Kershaw sank with the loss of seven crew members. President Garfield rescued 30 survivors from Kershaw. On 20 January 1929, President Garfield ran aground on Matanilla Reef in the Bahamas. Her passengers were taken off by the American passenger ship . She was refloated on 23 January. President Garfield was transferred from Dollar Line to American President Lines in 1938 and renamed President Madison in 1940. President Madison was delivered to the United States Government for World War II service at Boston on 6 September 1941 in a precursor of the procedure later followed by ships delivered to the War Shipping Administration (established 7 February 1942) and was operated by American President Lines as agent. World War II President Madison had just sailed from Manila when war came to the Pacific arriving at the blacked out Surabaya unaware of the war with lights lit and a big United States flag visible as they passed Japanese fishing boats. On being told to turn off lights and of war both passengers and crew began painting the ship grey and the carpenter fabricated an imitation wooden gun in hopes of keeping submarines from surfacing and being able to outrun the ship on its voyage to New York. The ship was dubbed the Phantom Ship, for dodging submarines while fleeing the Japanese under strict radio silence and presumed sunk to arrive safely in New York 92 days later. President Madison was purchased by the Navy at Baltimore on 11 April 1942. The ship was converted to a troop transport, renamed, classified as a transport with hull number AP-62 and commissioned on 5 August 1942 as USS Kenmore at Baltimore, Maryland with Commander Myron T. Richardson in command. =Commissioned as USS Kenmore (AP-62)= Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, Kenmore put in at Norfolk, Virginia, on 6 September and embarked men and equipment of the 13th Marine Defense Battalion and the 18th and 19th Naval Construction Battalions.

The division was formed in 1922 and was known also as the 76th Armenian Mountain Division. It was a Soviet infantry fighting unit of the Red Army that fought on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. The 76th was made up primarily of Armenians from the newly established Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia, but also included among its ranks several different nationalities. The division became the 51st Guards Rifle Division on 23 November 1942 for its actions in Operation Uranus. The division was reformed in 1943 from a rifle brigade. The division's second formation was disbanded in the summer of 1945.  Interwar period  The division was originally formed as the Armenian Rifle Division by an order of the Separate Caucasus Army on 5 September 1922 from the Consolidated Armenian Brigade, which had itself been formed from the Armenian Red Army on 18 November 1921, after the Red Army invasion of Armenia. The division was part of the Separate Caucasus Army. The 76th was led by several non-Armenian commanders including Major Generals S. V. Chernikov, E. F. Pryakhin, K. E. Goryunov, N. E. Kaladzen, N. T. Tavarkiladze (the latter two were ethnic Georgians), Colonel G. G. Voronin, and subordinate commanders A. P. Melik-Shahnazaryan, H. T. Atoyan (the latter two being Armenians).

Instruction was carried out in Armenian and the unit published a military newspaper, The Red Soldier, and a newsletter The Red Fighting Man (both in Armenian). During the Second World War, a third paper, Voroshilovets, under the aegis of Armenian novelist Hrachya Kochar, began publication in Russian. The division was reorganized as the Armenian Mountain Rifle Division in 1931. In 1935, the division became part of the Transcaucasian Military District when the Separate Caucasus Army was reorganized. On 2 December of that year, the division was named after Soviet Central Committee member (and later Marshal of the Soviet Union) Kliment Voroshilov. On 21 May 1936 it was redesignated as the 76th Armenian Mountain Rifle Division when the Red Army standardized its numbering system. The division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 29 May in commemoration of its fifteenth anniversary. In 1938, soldiers of other Soviet nationalities began to enter the ranks of the division, though it remained in the Armenian SSR and retained its flag, its number, and traditions. On 16 July 1940, the division's Armenian designation was removed when the Red Army officially converted national formations into regular units. The Second World War =Iran= In the summer of 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and drove into the large landmass of Russia and Ukraine on three fronts. The southernmost drove through the Caucasus with the objective of capturing the petroleum fields and reserves in Baku, Azerbaijan. By autumn, the German Wehrmacht had pushed far into the regions and was nearing the outlet of the northern Caucasus. In order to prevent a possible link up between Iran, whose leader Reza Shah Pahlavi harbored pro-German leanings, the Allies launched a joint mission to invade and occupy the country. The 76th Division, as part of the 47th Army of the Transcaucasian Front, crossed the Araks River in August at the border town of Julfa, Nakhichevan and settled in the northern Iranian city of Tabriz. =Ukraine, Stalingrad, Don= In September, the 76th was relocated to the North Caucasus in an attempt to halt the advance towards Rostov-on-Don of the German Army Group South. It fought in the Battle of Rostov in November, which temporarily retook the city and pushed Army Group South back to the Mius River. On 9 December, the 76th Mountain Rifle Division was redesignated as the 76th Rifle Division, part of the Southwestern Front's 38th Army. It was transferred to the 21st Army in May 1942. With Iran pacified, in September 1941 the division was sent to Ukraine in September and incorporated into the 38th Army. It took part in major fighting in Poltava, Kharkiv and Vovchansk during the First Battle of Kharkov. In February 1942, the division advanced westward and was reassigned and integrated into the 21st Army. In May 1942, the Voroshilov Division was once more on the offensive and advanced toward the Donets River. where it confronted the entrenched German Army Group South. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the division was able to cross the riverbank, and retake a line of towns straddling the Russian- Ukrainian border: Grafovka, Nekhotevka, Shamino and Arkhangelskoye. In June 1942, the 76th helped close a gap between the 21st and 38th Armies and halt German counter-offensives at Surkovo, Gavrilov-Yam and Pesyano. In July 1942, the division was sent to Stalingrad. After taking part in fighting there until October, it was ordered to weaken Army Group South's defensive lines near the Don River. It overran its lines at the railway terminus in Kletskaya, a feat which earned it the status of a Guards unit (November 23, 1942) and subsequent reorganization as the 51st Guards Rifle Division. =Second Formation= The division was reformed in the Tula area on 20 April 1943 from the 87th Rifle Brigade.

It originally premiered at the Theatre at Rutgers University in 1979. It was printed in 1981. The play is William Mastrosimone's first play. It has been produced a number of times and has won awards, including the L.A. Drama Critics Award in 1982. Plot It is a two-act play, set entirely in a small apartment in South Philadelphia. It centers around Rose and Cliff, two neurotic people searching for love. Rose is a nervous and flighty woman who is haunted by the past and obsessed with destruction; due to her hemophilia, she's closed herself off from the world. She works at a five-and-dime behind the candy counter. She dreams of true love and how she'll meet a man one day who is perfect for her. Cliff is a foul- mouthed, wise-cracking transcontinental truck driver who gets stuck in town when his truck breaks down. While he is waiting for his rig to be repaired, he wanders into Rose's store looking for a one-night stand. Rose then invites him over to her apartment and they start to argue about issues like her old and cranky neighbor and her boarded up window. Towards the end of the play, the reader finds out that Rose does a number of strange things including putting on perfume and a hair ribbon before going to sleep. Cliff thinks that another man is there, so he forces himself in and looks around expecting to find a lover, but instead finding a collection of men's sweaters in her closet. He soon finds out about her weird collection of men's sweaters. Earlier in the play, Rose recalls a story from her past. She was watching some birds at the zoo, when a group of boys started antagonizing her and throwing stones at the birds. The boys kill the birds, she panics and the police come and take her to the hospital to calm her down. Hints throughout the play suggest that the boys did more to her than talk dirty and kill the birds. It is a possibility that the birds were a metaphor, and the boys actually raped or hurt her physically. Like the birds, her spirit or some part of her could have been metaphorically \\"killed\\". This point in the play is when you can really start to tell that Rose is mentally unstable. Despite their differences, the two characters end up falling in love at the end of the play.

After playing college football at Washington State, Brink was drafted by the Houston Texans in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL Draft. In 2010, he joined the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. Brink has also played for the Toronto Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes. Early years A native of Eugene, Oregon, Alex Brink attended Sheldon High School, and becoming a letterman in football, basketball and baseball. In football, as a senior, he led his team to the state championship, with a 31-24 win over Lake Oswego. During that season he passed for 3946 yards and 36 touchdowns, while being named Oregon Player of the Year. He passed for over 3,500 yards in his junior season as well. His record as a high school starter was 35-3, with one state championship. In baseball, he was a standout player and threw a perfect game. He graduated from Sheldon High in 2003 with a 3.91 GPA. College career Brink finished his career as one of Washington State's all-time greats, holding the school career records in passing yards, touchdowns, attempts, completions and total offense. His senior year, he threw for 3,818 yards, the second highest single-season total in school's history. He is the only Cougar to have five 400-plus yard games and has five of the top 10 and three of the top four passing games in WSU history. Although the program was coming off three consecutive 10 win seasons when Brink inherited the team, he failed to lead the Cougars to a single winning season in four years as a starter. Brink finished his career as the third leading passer, in terms of yards, in Pac-10 history, behind Carson Palmer and Derek Anderson and fifth leader in touchdowns. He is also only the sixth signal caller in conference history to throw for more than 10,000 yards and toss 70-or-more touchdowns. In his college career, Brink completed 58.4 percent of his passes for 10,913 yards. He threw 76 touchdowns but also 43 interceptions. Brink led the Cougars to four straight seasons without a bowl berth. As a starter, Brink was 17-23 over four seasons. During a game against Oregon State University in the 2005 season Brink set a new school record with 531 passing yards. Ahead 30-16 at the break, the Cougars, however, lost that game due in part to defensive and special teams lapses and other mistakes, but also because Brink threw one touchdown against four interceptions. For much of the 2006 season, Brink led the Pac-10 in passing yards. He was named second team All-Pac-10 for his efforts. The Cougars were at one point in the 2006 season ranked No. 25 in the nation with a 6-3 record, but lost their final three games to finish the year at 6-6. In 2006-2007 Pac-10 rankings, he led the league in total offense with 242.2 yards per game, was second in passing at 241.6 ypg, and fourth in passing efficiency. Brink finished his senior year as the 2007 Pac-10 leader in total offense and named second team All-Pac-10. His final game as a Cougar resulted in a come-from-behind, 42-35 victory over rival University of Washington in the annual Apple Cup in which he threw for 399 yards and five touchdowns. He remains the only WSU quarterback ever to beat Washington three times.

Despite working for the government, he was openly against the Tokugawa regime. He is known for his role as leader in the rebellion against the Tokugawa shogunate.  Early life  ≈åshio was born as the eldest son in a samurai family in 1793. At the age of 15 he discovered he had a shameful ancestor who spent his days writing documents in the company of prisoners and municipals. This finding was the immediate cause of his decision to become a disciple of Neo-Confucianism. At the age of 24 he read a book about the morals and precepts of Chinese philosopher L√º Kun (1536-1618) and he then became inspired by L√º Kun's master: Wang Yangming.L√º Kun was a disciple of Wang Yangming and used a lot of his theories in his own scripts.  Career  From the age of 13, ≈åshio was employed as a Yoriki.A Yoriki is the assistant of a daimy≈ç, a Japanese warlord from feudal Japan Additionally, he was a police inspector in ≈åsaka. He proved his integrity by never accepting bribes and to oppose corruption. After 14 years he discovered that the new court official was a corrupt man which led to his resignation in 1830. Henceforth he began a pilgrimage to a place called ≈åmiThe ≈åmi province is an old Japanese province; today it includes the Shiga Prefecture. which led to his spiritual awakening. When he returned to ≈åsaka, he began writing and teaching about the Y≈çmeigaku and founded his own private school called the Senshind≈ç (Ê¥óÂøÉÊ¥û). ≈åshio spent the rest of his retirement teaching his students. Later on he published a book called Senshind≈ç Sakki (Ê¥óÂøÉÊ¥ûÁÆöË®ò), a compilation of scripts used in his lectures.  Philosophy  ≈åshio built upon the teachings of confucianism and the interpretation that learning innate knowledge could lead to inner peace, wisdom and the transcendence of life and death. His metaphysicsMetaphysics are a branch of philosophy which includes ontology and cosmology (philosophy of nature). was based on Wang Yangming's theory about Taiky≈ç (absolute spirit) and Makoto (sincerity). = Taiky≈ç (ËÉéÊïô) = Taiky≈ç is the fundamental creative power and the source of everything in the universe. One must turn to the absolute spirit if one wants to overcome the false, conventional categories of distinction. The re- identification with this absolute spirit makes life easier. One should adopt an attitude of true nature, sincere acts and an indifference to the concept of death. = Makoto (Ë™†) = Sincerity (Makoto, Ë™†) is known in Buddhism for acting according to distinct rules and standards. ≈åshio adopted the idea of sincerity from Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming and gave the idea a unique Japanese interpretation. One must act as a brave samurai who knows no fear of death. This inner quality is known as sincerity. It also reflects the course of action ≈åshio took during the rebellion.  The rebellion  = Cause = Image of the uprising led by ≈åshio The shogunate of the Edo-period, founded and influenced by the Tokugawa family since the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, was, next to climate, the biggest cause of suffering. Both the peasants and lower sub-caste samurai were affected by their actions. Agriculture and food production experienced a crisis due to a failed harvest in 1833 and 1836 and the government demanded high tax rates from ordinary citizens. This crisis was very rare in the ever-prosperous Kansai and unrest spread into the big cities. The population protested against the high-rise rice prices and as an act of resistance began to ushi kowashi (literal translation: 'break houses'). This led to the destruction of a large part of ≈åsaka. The unrest alarmed the Tokugawa shogunate and simultaneously ≈åshio, who at that moment was employed as a Yoriki. In 1837 ≈åshio sought help from the administrators and wealthy merchants of ≈åsaka, but his efforts were fruitless. There was no movement at the time for the rights of ordinary citizens, so ≈åshio ensured that the anger of the population was channeled to an organized uprising. Despite the fact that he had a lot of influence and was a member of the elite of Japan, he helped them fight the government's corruption. The failed harvest, which caused famine and high rice prices, together with exacerbating fiscal problems and problems with foreign countries (opium wars), is called the Tenp≈ç Crisis (1830-1844). This was the direct reason for the uprising led by ≈åshio Heihachir≈ç. = Resistance = ≈åshio Heihachir≈ç pictured by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi ≈åshio and his allies were forced to start the rebellion earlier than planned because a traitor informant had informed the authorities. On February 19, 1837, ≈åshio set fire to his house in ≈åsaka as a signal for his followers to start the rebellion before the Bakufu troops had the chance to suppress them. He ordered the farmers to burn tax archives and ordered the poor to rob the warehouses of the rich and redistribute the rice among the hungry population. Although planned in detail, the uprising was a fiasco. The insurgents were poorly trained in the use of weapons and combat techniques, but also the bakufu troops were inadequate. Eventually, the government soldiers were able to suppress the uprising and ≈åshio, together with his son, fled to the mountains. He was followed, but lit his shelter on fire before the bakufu troops could arrest him. He burned himself and his son alive. = Effects = One can conclude that this bold action was a failure. More than 3,000 houses burned and 30,000 to 40,000 koku riceKoku (Áü≥ È´ò) is a volume unit in Japan. 1 koku is about 278,3 liters. The koku was originally a means of measurement for the amount of rice that can feed one person for one year. were destroyed. The majority of his followers committed suicide and from the 29 insurgents who were captured, only five survived the interrogations. The survivors were salted so their bodies could be crucified.In ancient Japan, convicts were crucified to T-shaped wooden beams and were killed by spears. Despite all the hype, it is still unclear what ≈åshio's political program and strategy was. One suspects that he only wanted to help the population for symbolic and confucian reasons. A positive outcome was that it sparked the country's interest in international politics and that social and economic problems were addressed.  Footnotes   Sources  * Cullen, L. M.

Camp Joe Scherman (often abbreviated Camp Scherman) is a camping and recreation facility owned and operated by the Girl Scout Council of Orange County, that is located off the Pines to Palms Highway in Riverside County, Southern California. The camp is in the southern San Jacinto Mountains, at in elevation. The scenic property features rolling foothills of California montane chaparral and woodlands habitats below Pine Mountain, a junior Olympic-size pool, two ponds, and miles of trails for hiking and exploring. Camper's' activities include backpacking, sailing, canoeing, archery, horseback riding, swimming, arts & crafts, nature exploration, camping skills, games, drama, rock climbing, campfires, and outdoor cooking. History The land was originally the homeland the Cahuilla Indians, and many locations in the camp have names derived from the Cahuilla language. Joe Scherman (born 1902) was California's first state ranger and was intimately involved in GSCOC's purchase of the property upon which Camp Scherman was established. All were originally owned by James Wellman, a somewhat legendary big game hunter and good friend of Joe Scherman. Scherman helped GSCOC negotiate with Wellman for the property, and in 1959 the first were purchased for $96,500. Eighteen years later, in 1977, the final were purchased from the Wellman family to complete the property within Camp Scherman today.  Units  = Upper Camp = Upper Camp refers to the part of camp up the hill from Morris Ranch Road, the main road through camp. The Upper Camp portion contains the main kitchen that serves the entire camp.  Keeway  Keeway means \\"North Wind\\". The unit consists of two-sided rustic cabins with six bunks on each side. It shares a biffy and a shelter with Wabanino. The shelter is unenclosed. Keeway borders the dirt road from TC-4, making it very easy to access from anywhere in camp. Two trailheads lead away from Keeway: one goes to Kitchiwani and the other goes to Adoette.  Kitchiwani  Kitchiwani is a portmanteau of \\"Kitchino\\" and \\"Shawani\\", which mean South and West Wind. Kitchiwani, often called Kitchi, is the only unit in camp that has both tents and cabins. The cabins are rustic, two-sided cabins with six bunks on each side. The tents are platform tents which sleep eight campers in cots with mattresses. The Kitchi shelter is unenclosed. It also contains a costume closet, which is used for theater units. A stage is set up on the grass and props and costumes from the Kitchi closet are used. Kitchiwani is adjacent to TC-4, and is the first unit campers see upon arrival there. It is very centrally located and provides easy access to the rest of camp. Two trailheads lead away from Kitchiwani: one goes to Keeway/Wabanino and the other goes to Morris Ranch Rd., the main road through camp.  Pa Sol√©  Pa Sol√© means \\"Sitters on the Hill\\". Pa Sol√©, often called Paso, is made up of rustic cabins with four bunks. The shelter is unenclosed. Due to a lack of water pressure, Paso is not currently being used as a unit for campers, but is sometimes used for special events. Pa Sol√© sits at the top of the steepest hill in camp, just up the hill from the Dining Hall, Health Center, Holly Tree, and the Ark, as well as Ribbonwood and Snoqualamie. Despite its proximity to these buildings, Pa Sol√© is not easily accessible from the rest of camp due to the hill one must climb to reach it. A major trailhead leads away from Paso, which splits into the Sr. Loop Trail, 6064, and Red Rock.  Ribbonwood  Ribbonwood is named for the tree of the same name, which is very prevalent in the area, whose bark peels away in long ribbons. Ribbonwood consists of platform tents with four beds each. Ribbonwood shares its fully enclosed shelter with Snoqualamie, and the biffy is attached to the shelter. Ribbonwood is just past the flagpole, near the Dining Hall, Holly Tree, and Health Center. A trailhead leads away from Ribbonwood to an off-property rock-climbing program area.  Snoqualmie  Snoqualmie means \\"Moon People\\". Snoqualmie, often referred to as Snoq, is made up of rustic cabins with eight bunks each. The shelter, which it shares with Ribbonwood, is fully enclosed, and the biffy is attached. Snoqualamie is very close to the Dining Hall, Health Center, and Holly Tree, as well as the main dirt road which runs through Upper Camp. Because of its accessibility and convenience to the rest of camp, Snoqualmie is usually used for younger campers. Campers who stay there are often referred to as \\"Snoqers\\".  Wabanino  Wabanino means \\"East Wind\\", and is often referred to as Waba. The unit consists of two-sided rustic cabins with six bunks on each side. It shares a biffy and a shelter with Keeway. The shelter is unenclosed. Wabanino borders the dirt road from TC-4, making it very easy to access from anywhere in camp. Two trailheads lead away from Wabanino: one goes to Kitchiwani and the other goes to Adoette.  Whispering Winds  Whispering Winds is made up of eight-person rustic cabins. The shelter is enclosed, and the biffy is attached. It lies just off the main road, downhill a bit from the Dining Hall. Its accessibility to the road makes it very easy to get anywhere in camp very quickly.  Wyeena  Wyeena is a platform tent unit, with four girls to a tent. It has a small unenclosed shelter. Wyeena is past Whispering Winds, set far back in the canyon. It is not very accessible, and therefore it takes a while to get most places in camp. Rattlesnake Trail leads away from Wyeena towards the Dining Hall. = Lower Camp = Lower Camp refers to the part of camp downhill from Morris Ranch Rd., the main road through camp. It contains most of the program areas.  Adoette  Adoette means \\"Big Trees\\". The unit consists of two-sided rustic cabins with six bunks on each side. Adoette, often referred to as Ado, has its own enclosed shelter, but shares a biffy with nearby Tawasi. Ado is mainly used for horseback riding units, due to its proximity to the Tack House and Arena. Adoette is a bit far back from the road, but is very convenient to the nearby program areas. A trail leads away from Ado towards the 101 Meadow.  Prim  Prim is the primitive unit in camp. Girls sleep outside on mattresses on tarps. Prim was originally in a clearing past the Ranch House Cabins, although recently it has been in the 101 Meadow. The old Prim had a steel frame shelter with a canvas over it, a fire pit, and Porta-Biffs. The new Prim, however, does not have a shelter, but has its own biffy. Two tents are put up each session: one for the campers' gear and changing, and the other for the counselors' gear and changing. If weather is poor, campers in Prim are relocated to another unit, often Tawasi.  Ranch House Cabins  The Ranch House Cabins are very different from the other units in camp. The cabins have heating and electricity, as well as attached biffies. Each cabin typically has four bedrooms, each with six bunks. The unit is very close to Massey Hall, although a bit far from the rest of camp. Due to its higher-end accommodations, the Ranch House Cabins are usually used for younger, new campers. Many weekend camps also use the Ranch House Cabins.  Tawasi  Tawasi is the newest and smallest unit in camp. It is made up of two-sided rustic cabins with six bunks each. The shelter is enclosed, and Tawasi shares a biffy with the adjacent Adoette. A trailhead leads away from Tawasi towards the 101 meadow.  Wanish  Wanish means \\"Stream\\". It consists of two-sided rustic cabins with six bunks on each side. The shelter is enclosed, and the biffy is at the top of a small hill. Wanish is very close to Promise Lake, and is therefore usually used by waterfront units. Wanish is very close to all the program areas, as well as Adoette and Tawasi, and is therefore extremely convenient to the rest of camp.  Program Areas  Program Areas refer to the various locations in camp where campers can participate in recreational activities specific to that area. = Archery = = Arena and Tack House = The Arena and Tack House area is between Adoette and Wellman Road. It consists of the tack house, riding arena, and stables. All the horses at camp live here, and all the tack is stored here. Girls learn to ride in the arena before advancing to trail rides. Tack House Parties and Rodeos are also held here. Tack House Parties are an all-camp activity where girls from different units can play games or have a dance in the arena and eat desserts, and Rodeos are an all-camp activity that allows the girls in the horseback riding units an opportunity to demonstrate what they learned that session. = Arts and Crafts = Arts and Crafts is the located just across the road from the museum. Camper can participate in numerous art projects here, from candle dipping to pet-rocks. There is also a rack of lanyard string that anyone can use for lanyards and other various projects. The Arts and Crafts building has an indoor space with tables, as well as an outdoor area with picnic tables. All Camp Dinner is often served from these picnic tables. It also has a large refrigerator where extra food can be taken and stored. Arts and Crafts used to be located on the other side of the road, in a building which has not been used for many years due to safety concerns. It is now in the BOMB (Big Old Maintenance Building), which used to hold maintenance equipment downstairs and campers upstairs. = Honor Lake = The smaller of the two lakes at camp, Honor Lake is located just downhill from the pool, on the way to OCR and Archery. It is used primarily for canoeing, and campers are not allowed to swim in this lake. Due to the recent drought conditions, camp is no longer pumping extra water into the lake, and the water level has steadily been getting lower. Because of this, the lake has not been used much in recent summers. The lake was named for Honor E. Haynes, a Girl Scout volunteer who helped purchase the land for camp. = Pooh Corner = Pooh Corner is a small area in the trees behind the Dining Hall where Pooh and his friends live. This is a great place for younger campers to have Pooh Parties, where they read stories and eat Pooh Food (graham crackers and frosting). = Pool = The Pool area is located next to the Golf Course and the Meadow, across the road from Promise Lake. It consists of a junior-olympic sized pool, cubbies, a biffy, a picnic area, camper changing area and showers, pool house, and staff changing room and showers. Summer resident campers go swimming at the pool every day. The pool is also available for other programs, such as night swims, polar bear swims, and swamping. Certified lifeguards are always on duty when anyone is on the pool deck. The pool consists of a deep end, middle end, and shallow end. Campers must pass a basic swim test to swim in the deep or middle ends during summer resident camp. = Ropes Course = New as of Summer 2016, the Ropes Course is located just past Wanish and Promise Lake. It consists of a shaded picnic area as well as several structures related to each challenge in the course. The Ropes Course at Camp Scherman is a low-ropes course. The elements are focused mostly on teamwork rather than heights. Elements rage greatly in difficulty in order to make the course suitable for both younger and older campers. Some of the major elements include the Team Wall, Spiderwebs, and tightropes. Scherman Helmets must be worn any time a person is being lifted in any way.

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Naps (1911), Brooklyn Dodgers (1912‚Äì13), Cincinnati Reds (1914) and Washington Senators (1918). Yingling was born in Chillicothe, Ohio and attended Steele High School in Dayton. Yingling began his professional career with the Dayton Veterans from 1907 to 1909 and the Toledo Mud Hens from 1910 to 1911. He married Florine Sausser in 1908 after she said she would marry him if he struck out the next hitter, which he did. His best season between Toledo and Dayton was 1910, finishing the year with a win-loss record of 22-9 in 287 innings pitched. Yingling made his major league debut for the Cleveland Naps on April 12, 1911, and pitched in four games for the team. After the 1911 season, he along with Pat Paige were selected by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the rule 5 draft. He spent the next two seasons with the Dodgers, going 6-11 with a 3.59 earned run average (ERA) in 1912 and 8-8 with a 2.58 ERA in 1913; he also had a .383 batting average in 40 games for the team in 1913. In one game for the Dodgers, Yingling threw only one pitch against the Cincinnati Reds, causing the batter to ground into a double play before being replaced; coming into a game to face one batter was a rare move at the time. After the 1913 season, Yingling was purchased by the Reds, where he had a 9-13 record and a 3.45 ERA in 34 games. He then spent the next two seasons with the Minneapolis Millers, winning 19 and 24 games, respectively. After considering retirement, the Washington Senators signed him to a contract just before the 1917 season. Yingling served in the military during World War I, and returned to Washington for the 1918 season. He pitched in five games for the team, then spent three more seasons with Minneapolis before retiring from the game. He died in Columbus, Ohio in 1962 at the age of 73.

It describes the first interstellar voyage, undertaken to escape the tyranny that rules the Earth.Harrison, I.R. and R.C. Schlobin, Andre Norton; A Primary and Secondary Bibliography, Pg 4, , NESFA Press, Framingham, MA Norton wrote a sequel, Star Born, which was published in 1957. Plot summary =Back story= The Moon, Mars and Venus have been explored and found unsuitable for colonization. Back on the Earth, two very different factions compete to determine the future of humanity: the Free Scientists, who refuse to accept political, racial and religious divisions, and the nationalists. Armed men seize control of one of the space stations orbiting the planet, convert it into a weapon, and (perhaps accidentally) devastate most of the world's heavily populated areas. A fanatic named Arturo Renzi rises up, blaming the catastrophe on the scientists and \\"techneers\\" and espousing a return to a simpler, less technological life. When he is assassinated, the Free Scientists are hunted down. Within a period of three days, most are killed; the few remaining survivors are either enslaved by the ruling Peacemen of the Company of Pax or go into hiding, to be tracked down one by one in the following years. Society is structured into three classes, the Peacemen nobility and their landsmen overseers, a vast peasantry, and the work-slaves, composed of actual or suspected scientists. Most technology is rejected and civilization ebbs. =In hiding= Chemist Lars Nordis, his daughter Dessie, and younger brother Dard, are among the lucky ones. They escape the great purge (though Lars is crippled as a result) and find a precarious refuge on a small farm. There, Lars continues his research as best he can and stays in touch with an underground network of scientists working on some great project. One day, Lars finishes his work and notifies his contacts. As a precaution, he makes Dard and Dessie memorize what seems to them to be meaningless words and patterns. But before they can be taken to the last secret stronghold of the scientists, the suspicious local landsman, Hew Folley, calls in the Peacemen to raid their home. Dard and Dessie escape, but Lars is killed. Dard contacts Sach, an agent of the scientists, who agrees to guide them to the refuge. Once inside, Dard learns that the scientists and their supporters are feverishly building a starship to escape the tyranny. They desperately need what Lars was working on: suspended animation. Only it can bring the stars within reach, for the journey will take many, many years. The information that Dard and Dessie had memorized turns out to be what they have been waiting for. But the scientists are racing against time, for the Peacemen are hunting for them. Before they can leave, there is one more task. They need to plot a course using a computer. The only one they know of that still works is located in Pax headquarters. Dard volunteers to lead pilot-astrogator Simba Kimber to it, since he visited the place years ago. They succeed, though they barely avoid capture, and manage to return with the priceless calculations. Then the refuge is found and comes under attack. Fighting a desperate rearguard action, the defenders manage to hold off the Peacemen long enough to blast off. Then, trusting in Lars' invention, they set their course and undergo suspended animation. =Ad astra (To the stars)= When they awaken (though a few never do), they find themselves near a star with a hospitable planet. They land and begin to build their new colony. While exploring the surroundings, they discover a cargo container; though they detected no signs of technology from orbit, the planet may still be inhabited by an intelligent race. Dard goes along on a scouting expedition. The explorers find the remains of a road, which leads to a war-wrecked, abandoned city. While travelling in their rocket sled, they barely survive being shot down by decrepit, automated anti-aircraft guns. The sled can barely fly, so some of the explorers have to walk back. When they return, they find a thriving settlement. Soon afterwards, Dessie protects a \\"sea baby\\" from small flying \\"dragons\\". It turns out that the creature is intelligent. Its parents appear out of the ocean and retrieve their offspring. Seeing that the humans are friendly, their tribe or clan is soon trading goods and information. They are telepathic and can communicate with the newcomers if they hold hands. They reveal that they were once the slaves of the species that built the city. They escaped when the Others warred with each other. Now there are none of the Others left on the continent, but they still live across the sea. But that is a problem for another day. For now, the humans have found a new home.

History =Formation and early performances= French writer and artist Beno√Æt Morel was working as a designer at publishing house √âditions Gallimard in Paris‚Äôs Belleville quarter when he met Pierre Payan, a multi-instrumentalist who was in need of lyrics. Morel had already written lyrics for neo-realist group Les T√™tes Raides, and discovered that he and Payan shared an interest in 'literary‚Äô music such as the work of Georges Brassens, L√©o Ferr√©'s song interpretations of the poetry of Louis Aragon, Les Fr√®res Jacques' performances of the poems of Jacques Pr√©vert, and anarchist singer-songwriter Gaston Cout√©. The two were soon joined by Eric \\"Fil\\" Philippon, and began playing out in October 1990 with the release of a self-financed 10\\" vinyl EP and as openers for Les T√™tes Raides. By 1992 La Tordue were headlining gigs that featured a rotation of many instruments, including concertina, guitar, piano, double bass, musical saw and saucepans. This versatility of instrumentation allowed the band to play a variety of venues from informal gigs on the street to large festivals, and soon La Tordue found themselves headed on a 400-date tour. In 1993, they opened the Transmusicales rock festival in Morel's hometown of Rennes. The following year they were selected by FAIR (Fonds d'Aide √† l'Initiative Rock) and went on to win the Tremplin du Chorus des Halles competition, following this up with the Grand Prix du Sentier des Halles and the Prix du Coup de C≈ìur Francophone. In June 1994 they performed at the Music Festival of Romania, a month later they were guests at the Francofolies festival in La Rochelle. =Recording and later years= For five years La Tordue played without releasing an album. Their 1995 debut release, Les Choses de Rien sold 3,000 copies in less than three months without any publicity. Their second album, 1997's T'es Fou, was awarded the prestigious Acad√©mie Charles Cros Grand Prix du Disque. A long tour followed, including a two weeks in Eastern Europe and a three-week stint at L'Europ√©en in Paris. La Tordue's third album, 2000's Le Vent t'Invite (\\"The Wind Invites You\\") broke through with French music fans, establishing the group as one of the most interesting acts on the French Nouvelle Chanson scene. In their first decade as a band, La Tordue had played over 1,000 concerts and sold some 150,000 albums. For the band's tenth anniversary, they released the live album En Vie and embarked on a 40-stop mini-tour with the addition of a fourth member, percussionist Mathieu Morel. In late 2002, Sony Music released La Tordue's major label debut, Champ Libre (\\"Open Field\\"). More slickly produced, the album mixed reggae and ska with La Tordue's more traditionally French chanson style. The album's final track, Le P√©trin, is a protest against France's \\"double punishment\\" law that deports immigrants from France after they have served a prison sentence. The track was sung in a dozen foreign languages by numerous artists such as Robert Wyatt, Lo‚ÄôJo Triban, Magyd Cherfi of Zebda, Sergent Garcia, Samy Birnbach, Dezoriental, Danyel Waro, and the Tuvan throat singing of Yat Kha. Their track \\"Ren√© Bouteille\\" was also included in the 2002 compilation 'Cuisine Non-stop' on David Byrne's Luaka Bop label. La Tordue disbanded in 2003. Beno√Æt Morel continued his work as an illustrator and went on to record a solo album, F√©lin pour l‚ÄôAutre, released in 2007.

Graphic novels and zines Coming from a professional music background in the 1960s, Kunkel met and became friends with fan newsletter/fanzine writers Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley in 1971 in New York City. Katz and Worley hosted monthly science fiction fanzine parties at their apartment and these were attended by several notable figures in the fanzine and comic scenes. At one of these parties, Kunkel met Denny O'Neil and their friendship led to Kunkel writing comics for DC, Marvel, and Harvey.Williams, Carl. \\"The Game Doctor Is In...\\". RetroMags.com. 31 May 2009. Kunkel wrote several comic book stories which were published by DC Comics in 1977‚Äì1978 including Action Comics, \\"Madame Xanadu\\" in Doorway to Nightmare, and \\"Vigilante\\" in World's Finest Comics. At Marvel Comics, he wrote two issues of Marvel Team-Up in 1978‚Äì1979. By the late 1970s, Kunkel's freelancing efforts for Harvey had led to his becoming the primary scripter for the Richie Rich comics. Professional wrestling journalism Alongside his work with comics, Kunkel also worked during the 1970s in the niche field of professional wrestling journalism and became known as a ground-breaking wrestling journalist. Working in collaboration with Arnie Katz, Joyce Worley, and his wife Charlene, Kunkel edited, published, and served as photographer for Main Event magazineKunkel, Bill; Meikle, Betty A.; WWF: Warzone 64.

Gamasutra. 28 December 2009. Kunkel soon became a \\"must-read\\" columnist and played a key part during the early days of Pro Wrestling Torch in turning the small newsletter into a wrestling newsletter powerhouse. Adopting the moniker, \\"Potshot\\", Kunkel later moved to Wrestling Perspective as a featured columnist and cartoonist. Along with the Phantom of the Ring, Kunkel's work for Wrestling Perspective attracted respect and prestige to the publication. During the late 1980s, Kunkel co-designed the first professional WWF-based wrestling video game, MicroLeague Wrestling (C64, Subway Software), and in 1989 he co-hosted a local Las Vegas professional wrestling radio show with Ric \\"Hotline\\" Carter. Video game journalism Discovering common interests in the then-nascent video game industry, Kunkel, Katz and Worley approached Video editor, Bruce Apar in 1978 about writing a video game column for his magazine. Apar agreed and \\"Arcade Alley\\" was launched that Spring,Federico, Chris. \\"A Lifetime to Master - An Interview with Bill Kunkel\\". Orphaned Computer & Game Systems. 14 June 2002. with Katz writing under the pseudonym \\"Frank T. Laney II\\". Although Video publisher, Jay Rosenfield (of Reese Publishing Co.) had initial concerns over whether there was sufficient reader interest to justify Arcade Alley, the column proved to be of significant interest to readers. Working in direct consultation with game designers, Kunkel, Katz (who began writing under his real name starting in April 1982), and Worley popularized the new \\"sport\\" of \\"electronic gamesmanship\\",Apar, Bruce. \\"Switch On! - A Message to Readers of E.G.\\" Electronic Games. Vol.1, No.1. Winter 1981. and by 1981 they had secured the blessing of Rosenfield to launch a new magazine under Reese Publishing that would be entirely dedicated to video games. The first issue of Electronic Games, and first dedicated video game magazine published in the United States, was released in October 1981.Plunkett, Luke. \\"A Little Background On The World's First Ever Video Game Magazine\\". Kotaku. 29 December 2009. Bill Kunkel was the executive editor of Electronic Games Magazine in the early 1980s. Kunkel was also editor-in-chief of Tips & Tricks magazine from January 2007 until August 2007 when it ceased publication. Following staff cuts at Reese Publications in 1984‚Äì1985, Kunkel left Reese to join his two lifelong friends, Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley (who had both been laid off) and formed Katz Kunkel Worley, Inc. (KKW) to focus on journalistic content, and Subway Software to focus on game design. Kunkel's nickname, \\"The Game Doctor\\", was based on a column he wrote for several magazines (including both versions of Electronic Games, VG&CE;, EGM, and CGW) and game sites (including HappyPuppy.com, PostalNation.net and J2Games.com). Kunkel remained active in the industry until his death, having served as editor-in-chief of Tips & Tricks during its final year of publication (2007). He continued to be active as a member of Running With Scissors and EIC of Postal Nation (PostalNation.net) and wrote regularly for J2Games.com. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Classic Gaming Expo in 1999 along with the other co-founders of the original Electronic Games magazine, Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley-Katz. The trio revived the Electronic Games title for several years in the early 1990s for Sendai/Decker. Dubbed \\"The Grandfather of video game journalism\\", Kunkel wrote numerous retrospective \\"memoir pieces\\" for DigitPress as an irregular series entitled \\"The Kunkel Report\\" (a reference to one of Kunkel's columns by the same name in Electronic Games), and for GoodDealGames.com. In articles like these Kunkel detailed his role in the video game industry from its earliest years, discussed his decision to testify on behalf of smaller video game companies in lawsuits against larger corporations, and described the difficult task of maintaining journalistic integrity and critical neutrality in the face of lucrative investment opportunities such as the offer by Steve Case to invest in AOL precursor Quantum Link that Kunkel (who was reviewing software for the Commodore 64) was forced to turn down in order to maintain credibility as a journalist.Fulton, Steve. \\"The Game Doctor Confesses to GamerDad\\".

Family =Parents= Prince Felix was the heir of one of the wealthiest families of Russia and of Europe. Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia was the daughter of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, the elder daughter of Tsar Alexander III and sister of Tsar Nicolas II. After the February Revolution, the Yusupovs fled Russia and settled in Paris, leaving behind most of their wealth. At first, the little girl was raised by her paternal grandparents until, at the age of nine, they returned the little princess to her parents. According to her father, Prince Felix Yusupov Feliksovitch, his daughter received a poor education causing an alteration in the character of the girl, who became capricious. Princess Irina Felixovna Yusupova was raised by nannies and, whilst she adored her father, she was very distant with her mother. =Marriage= Princess Irina married on 19 June 1938 in Paris, France, Count Nikolai Dmitrievich Sheremetev (28 October 1904, Moscow, Russia ‚Äì 5 February 1979, Paris, France), son of Count Dmitri Sergeievich Sheremetev and his wife Countess Irina Ilarionovna Vorontsova-Dashkova. His ancestors include Boris Petrovich Sheremetev and Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov. He worked with the shipping company, Vlasoff.

First detected using long term strain measurements, most slow earthquakes now appear to be accompanied by fluid flow and related tremor, which can be detected and approximately located using seismometer data filtered appropriately (typically in the 1‚Äì5 Hz band). That is, they are quiet compared to a regular earthquake, but not \\"silent\\" as described in the past. Slow earthquakes should not be confused with tsunami earthquakes, in which relatively slow rupture velocity produces tsunami out of proportion to the triggering earthquake. In a tsunami earthquake, the rupture propagates along the fault more slowly than usual, but the energy release occurs on a similar timescale to other earthquakes. __TOC__ Causes Common Cross Section of a Subduction Zone Earthquakes occur as a consequence of gradual stress increases in a region, and once it reaches the maximum stress that the rocks can withstand a rupture generates and the resulting earthquake motion is related to a drop in the shear stress of the system. Earthquakes generate seismic waves when the rupture in the system occurs, the seismic waves consist of different types of waves that are capable of moving through the Earth like ripples over water. The causes that lead to slow earthquakes have only been theoretically investigated, by the formation of longitudinal shear cracks that were analysed using mathematical models. The different distributions of initial stress, sliding frictional stress, and specific fracture energy are all taken into account. If the initial stress minus the sliding frictional stress (with respect to the initial crack) is low, and the specific fracture energy or the strength of the crustal material (relative to the amount of stress) is high then slow earthquakes will occur regularly. In other words, slow earthquakes are caused by a variety of stick-slip and creep processes intermediated between asperity-controlled brittle and ductile fracture. Asperities are tiny bumps and protrusions along the faces of fractures. They are best documented from intermediate crustal levels of certain subduction zones (especially those that dip shallowly ‚Äî SW Japan, Cascadia, Chile), but appear to occur on other types of faults as well, notably strike-slip plate boundaries such as the San Andreas fault and \\"mega- landslide\\" normal faults on the flanks of volcanos. Locations Cascadia Subduction Cross Section Faulting takes place all over Earth; faults can include convergent, divergent, and transform faults, and normally occur on plate margins. some of the locations that have been recently studied for slow earthquakes include: Cascadia, California, Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, and Alaska. The locations of slow earthquakes can provide new insights into the behavior of normal or fast earthquakes. By observing the location of tremors associated with slow-slip and slow earthquakes, seismologists can determine the extension of the system and estimate future earthquakes in the area of study.  Types  Teruyuki Kato identifies various types of slow earthquake: * low frequency earthquakes (LFE) * very low frequency earthquakes (VLF) and deep-low-frequency earthquakes * slow slip events (SSE) * episodic tremor and slip (ETS)  Low frequency earthquakes  Plots of seismic events based on their average amplitudes and frequencies. Low frequency earthquakes are peaked between 1 and 3 Hz. Low frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are seismic events defined by waveforms with periods far greater than those of ordinary earthquakes and abundantly occur during slow earthquakes. LFEs can be volcanic, semi-volcanic, or tectonic in origin, but only tectonic LFEs or LFEs generated during slow earthquakes are described here. Tectonic LFEs are characterized by generally low magnitudes (M<3) and have frequencies peaked between 1 and 3 Hz. They are the largest constituent of non-volcanic tremor at subduction zones, and in some cases are the only constituent. In contrast to ordinary earthquakes, tectonic LFEs occur largely during long-lived slip events at subduction interfaces (up to several weeks in some cases) called slow slip events (SSEs). The mechanism responsible for their generation at subduction zones is thrust-sense slip along transitional segments of the plate interface. LFEs are highly sensitive seismic events which can likely be triggered by tidal forces as well as propagating waves from distant earthquakes. LFEs have hypocenters located down-dip from the seismogenic zone, the source region of megathrust earthquakes. During SSEs, LFE foci migrate along strike at the subduction interface in concert with the primary shear slip front. The depth occurrence of low frequency earthquakes is in the range of approximately 20‚Äì45 kilometers depending on the subduction zone, and at shallower depths at strike-slip faults in California. At \\"warm\\" subduction zones like the west coast of North America, or sections in eastern Japan this depth corresponds to a transition or transient slip zone between the locked and stable slip intervals of the plate interface. The transition zone is located at depths approximately coincidental with the continental Mohorovicic discontinuity. At the Cascadia subduction zone, the distribution of LFEs form a surface roughly parallel to intercrustal seismic events, but displaced 5‚Äì10 kilometers down-dip, providing evidence that LFEs are generated at the plate interface. Subducting plate geometry and the kinematically defined interplate zones. The locked zone is the most shallow where the two plates are locked together, the transient slip zone is downdip of the locked zone and is the site of SSEs, and the stable slip zone is where the two plates are continuously slipping at their interface. Low frequency earthquakes are an active area of research and may be important seismic indicators for higher magnitude earthquakes. Since slow slip events and their corresponding LFE signals have been recorded, none of them have been accompanied by a megathrust earthquake, however, SSEs act to increase the stress in the seismogenic zone by forcing the locked interval between the subducting and overriding plate to accommodate for down-dip movement. Some calculations find that the probability of a large earthquake occurring during a slow slip event are 30‚Äì100 times greater than background probabilities. Understanding the seismic hazard that LFEs might herald is among the primary reasons for their research. Additionally, LFEs are useful for the tomographic imaging of subduction zones because their distributions accurately map the deep plate contact near the Mohorovicic discontinuity. = History = Low frequency earthquakes were first classified in 1999 when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began differentiating LFE's seismic signature in their seismicity catalogue. The discovery and understanding of LFEs at subduction zones is due in part to the fact that the seismic signatures of these events were found away from volcanoes. Prior to their discovery, tremor events of this style were mainly associated with volcanism where the tremor is generated by partial coupling of flowing magmatic fluids. Japanese researchers first detected \\"low-frequency continuous tremor\\" near the top of the subducting Philippine Sea plate in 2002. After initially interpreting this seismic data as dehydration induced tremor, researchers in 2007 found that the data contained many LFE waveforms, or LFE swarms. Prior to 2007, tremor and LFEs were believed to be distinct events that often occurred together, but contemporarily LFEs are known to be the largest constituent forming tectonic tremor. LFEs and SSEs are frequently observed at subduction zones in western North America, Japan, Mexico, Costa Rica, New Zealand, as well as in shallow strike slip faults in California. = Detection = Low frequency earthquakes do not exhibit the same seismic character as regular earthquakes namely because they lack distinct, impulsive body waves. P-wave arrivals from LFEs have amplitudes so small that they are often difficult to detect, so when the JMA first distinguished the unique class of earthquake it was primarily by the detection of S-wave arrivals which were emergent. Because of this, detecting LFEs is nearly impossible using classical techniques. Despite their lack of important seismic identifiers, LFEs can be detected at low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) thresholds using advanced seismic correlation methods. The most common method for identifying LFEs involves the correlation of the seismic record with a template constructed from confirmed LFE waveforms. Since LFEs are such subtle events and have amplitudes that are frequently drowned out by background noise, templates are built by stacking similar LFE waveforms to reduce the SNR. Noise is reduced to such an extent that a relatively clean waveform can be searched for in the seismic record, and when correlation coefficients are deemed high enough an LFE is detected. Determination of the slip orientation responsible for LFEs and earthquakes in general is done by the P-wave first-motion method. LFE P-waves, when successfully detected, have first motions indicative of compressional stress, indicating that thrust-sense slip is responsible for their generation. Extracting high quality P-wave data out of LFE waveforms can be quite difficult, however, and is furthermore important for accurate hypocentral depth determinations. The detection of high quality P-wave arrivals is a recent advent thanks to the deployment of highly sensitive seismic monitoring networks. The depth occurrence of LFEs are generally determined by P-wave arrivals but have also been determined by mapping LFE epicenters against subducting plate geometries. This method does not discriminate whether or not the observed LFE was triggered at the plate interface or within the down-going slab itself, so additional geophysical analysis is required to determine where exactly the focus is located. Both methods find that LFEs are indeed triggered at the plate contact. = Low frequency earthquakes in Cascadia = Cascadia subduction zone. GPS data recording episodic slip events in the Cascadia from Albert Head Station, Victoria The Cascadia subduction zone spans from northern California to about halfway up Vancouver Island and is where the Juan de Fuca, Explorer, and Gorda plates are overridden by North America. In the Cascadia subduction zone, LFEs are predominantly observed at the plate interface down-dip of the seismogenic zone. In the southern section of the subduction zone from latitudes 40¬∞N to 41.8¬∞N low frequency earthquakes occur at depths between 28‚Äì47 kilometers, whereas farther north near Vancouver Island the range contracts to approximately 25‚Äì37 kilometers. This depth section of the subduction zone has been classified by some authors as the \\"transient slip\\" or \\"transition\\" zone due to its episodic slip behavior and is bounded up-dip and down-dip by the \\"locked zone\\" and \\"stable-slip zone\\", respectively. The transient slip section of the Cascadia is marked by high Vp/Vs ratios (P-wave velocity divided by S-wave velocity) and is designated as a Low Velocity Zone (LVZ). Furthermore, the LVZ has high Poisson's ratios as determined by teleseismic wave observations. These seismic properties defining the LVZ have been interpreted as an overpressured region of the down-going slab with high pore fluid pressures. The presence of water at the subduction interface and its relation to the generation of LFEs is not fully understood, but hydrolytic weakening of the rock contact is likely important. Where megathrust earthquakes (M>8) have been repeatedly observed in the shallow sections (<25 km depth) of the Cascadia subduction zone, low frequency earthquakes have recently been discovered to occur at greater depths, down-dip of the seismogenic zone. The first indicator of low frequency earthquakes in Cascadia was discovered in 1999 when an aseismic event took place at the subduction interface wherein the overriding North American Plate slipped 2 centimeters south-west over a several week period as recorded by Global Positioning System (GPS) sites in British Columbia. This apparent slow slip event occurred over a 50-by-300-kilometer area and took approximately 35 days. Researchers estimated that the energy released in such an event would be equivalent to a magnitude 6‚Äì7 earthquake, yet no significant seismic signal was detected. The aseismic character of the event led observers to conclude that the slip was mediated by ductile deformation at depth. After further analysis of the GPS record, these reverse slip events were found to repeat at 13- to 16-month intervals, and last 2 to 4 weeks at any one GPS station. Soon after, geophysicists were able to extract the seismic signatures from these slow slip events and found that they were akin to tremor and classified the phenomenon as episodic tremor and slip (ETS). Upon the advent of improved processing techniques, and the discovery that LFEs form part of tremor, low frequency earthquakes were widely considered a commonplace occurrence at the plate interface down-dip of the seismogenic zone in Cascadia. Low frequency tremors in the Cascadia subduction zone are strongly associated with tidal loading. A number of studies in Cascadia find that the peak low frequency earthquake signals alternate from being in phase with peak tidal shear stress rate to being in phase with peak tidal shear stress, suggesting that LFEs are modulated by changes in sea level. The shear slip events responsible for LFEs are therefore quite sensitive to pressure changes in the range of several kilo-pascals. = Low frequency earthquakes in Japan = Japan subduction setting. The discovery of LFEs originates in Japan at the Nankai trough and is in part due to the nationwide collaboration of seismological research following the Kobe earthquake of 1995. Low frequency earthquakes in Japan were first observed in a subduction setting where the Philippine Sea plate subducts at the Nankai trough near Shikoku. The low-frequency continuous tremor researchers observed was initially interpreted to be a result of dehydration reactions in the subducting plate. The source of these tremors occurred at an average depth of around 30 kilometers, and they were distributed along the strike of the subduction interface over a length of 600 kilometers. Similar to Cascadia, these low frequency tremors occurred with slow slip events that had a recurrence interval of approximately 6 months. The later discovery of LFEs forming tremor confirmed the widespread existence of LFEs at Japanese subduction zones, and LFEs are widely observed and believed to occur as a result of SSEs. The distribution of LFEs in Japan are centered around the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate and not the Pacific plate farther north. This is likely due to the difference in subduction geometries between the two plates. The Philippine Sea plate at the Nankai trough subducts at shallower overall angles than does the Pacific plate at the Japan Trench, thereby making the Japan trench less suitable for SSEs and LFEs. LFEs in Japan have hypocenters located near the deepest extent of the transition zone, down- dip from the seismogenic zone. Estimates for the depth occurrence of the seismogenic zone near Tokai, Japan are 8‚Äì22 kilometers as determined by thermal methods. Furthermore, LFEs occur at a temperature range of 450‚Äì500 ¬∞C in Tokai, indicating that temperature may play an important role in the generation of LFEs in Japan.  Very low frequency earthquakes  Very low frequency earthquakes (VLFs) can be considered a sub-category of low frequency earthquakes that differ in terms of duration and period. VLFs have magnitudes of approximately 3-3.5, durations around 20 seconds, and are further enriched in low frequency energy (0.03‚Äì0.02 Hz). VLFs predominantly occur with LFEs, but the reverse is not true. There are two major subduction zone settings where VLFs have been detected, 1) within the offshore accretionary prism and 2) at the plate interface down-dip of the seismogenic zone. Since these two environments have considerably different depths, they have been termed shallow VLFs and deep VLFs, respectively. Like LFEs, very low frequency earthquakes migrate along-strike during ETS events. VLFs have been found at both the Cascadia subduction zone in western North America, as well as in Japan at the Nankai trough and Ryukyu trench. VLFs are produced by reverse fault mechanisms, similar to LFEs.  Slow slip events  Slow slip events (SSEs) are long lived shear slip events at subduction interfaces and the physical processes responsible for the generation of slow earthquakes. They are slow thrust-sense displacement episodes that can have durations up to several weeks, and are thus termed \\"slow\\". In many cases, the recurrence interval for slow slip events is remarkably periodic and accompanied by tectonic tremor, prompting seismologists to term episodic tremor and slip (ETS). In the Cascadia, the return period for SSEs is approximately 14.5 months, but varies along the margin of the subduction zone. In the Shikoku region in southwest Japan, the interval is shorter at approximately 6 months, as determined by crustal tilt changes. Some SSEs have durations in excess of several years, like the Tokai SSE that lasted from mid-2000 to 2003. Slow slip event's locus of displacement propagate along the strike of subduction interfaces at velocities of 5‚Äì10 kilometers per day during slow earthquakes in the Cascadia, and this propagation is responsible for the similar migration of LFEs and tremor.  Episodic tremor and slip  Earthquake FW-HW diagram Slow earthquakes can be episodic (relative of plate movement), and therefore somewhat predictable, a phenomenon termed \\"episodic tremor and slip\\" or \\"ETS\\" in the literature. ETS events can last for weeks as opposed to \\"normal earthquakes\\" occur in a matter of seconds. Several slow-earthquake events around the world appear to have triggered major, damaging seismic earthquakes in the shallower crust (e.g., 2001 Nisqually, 1995 Antofagasta). Conversely, major earthquakes trigger \\"post-seismic creep\\" in the deeper crust and mantle. Every five years a year-long quake of this type occurs beneath the New Zealand capital, Wellington. It was first measured in 2003, and has reappeared in 2008 and 2013. It lasts for around a year each time, releasing as much energy as a magnitude 7 quake.

Prior to the creation of the Fishing Creek Reservoir and other artificial lakes by Duke Power, the falls were a major landmark on the river. The rapids could be heard from long distances away, while a major pre-Columbian trading path ran near the left bank. Historically the Great Falls of the Catawba were approximately 4 miles long, with a total elevation drop of 121 feet. (The word \\"falls\\" was an 18th-century appellation, when any river rapids and vertical waterfalls alike were both referred to as falls.) The creation of the dams at Great Falls, South Carolina has resulted in the top 2 miles of it being completely dry (dewatered) except during times of very high flow. The bottom portion of historical Great Falls is drowned by Cedar Creek dam, another hydroelectric project. As of 2006, interest groups have formed in the Carolinas to restore the Great Falls by altering the dam and restoring flow to the dewatered stretch of Great Falls as part of a major restoration project of the Catawba River.

History The town name is the product of a misspelling of Rokeby (after Henry Montagu, the 6th Baron Rokeby of Armagh, after whom Rokeby Road in Subiaco is also named). The nearby Mount Rokeby was named by John Septimus Roe in 1835, but when a station on the Great Southern Railway was opened in 1889, it was incorrectly spelt Mount Kokeby. The name stuck and the nearby hill's name was changed in 1950. In 1899 the government land agent in Beverley suggested blocks of land be made available adjacent to the station, and following survey a townsite was gazetted here in 1902. An agricultural hall was built, but has since been demolished. The locality is predominantly used for wheat and sheep farming. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

Early life and career Eaton was born in Washington, D.C., and was the daughter of Charles Henry Eaton. She began attending dance lessons in Washington D.C., along with her sisters Doris and Mary, at a young age. In 1911, all three sisters were hired for a production of Maurice Maeterlinck's fantasy play The Blue Bird at the Shubert Belasco Theatre in Washington. While Eaton had a minor role in the show, it served as her introduction to the world of professional theatre. After The Blue Bird, in 1912, the three Eaton sisters and their younger brother Joe began appearing in various plays and melodramas for the Poli stock company. They quickly gained reputations as professional, reliable, and versatile actors, and were rarely out of work. In 1915, all three sisters appeared in a new production of The Blue Bird for Poli; Doris and Mary were given the starring roles of Mytyl and Tytyl. The siblings were subsequently invited to reprise their roles for a New York and road tour of the play, produced by the Shubert Brothers. Although Pearl had a minor role in The Blue Bird, her dancing impressed the Shuberts, who offered her a place in the chorus of Al Jolson's latest show at the Winter Garden Theatre, Robinson Crusoe, Jr. It marked the beginning of her career as an adult musical theatre performer. Success onstage and onscreen Following her performance in Robinson Crusoe, Jr., Eaton appeared in The Passing Show. When the production went on tour, Eaton remained with the cast. While on the road, she fell in love with one of the company musicians, violinist Harry Levant. The two were married in 1917; the following year, Eaton gave birth to a daughter, Doris. However, shortly after giving birth, she regained her dancing form and was back at the Winter Garden, appearing as a specialty dancer in Sinbad. Levant and Eaton were divorced in November 1928. In the spring of 1918, Eaton was hired as a chorus dancer for the latest edition of the Ziegfeld Follies. She would remain with Ziegfeld for five years, appearing in the Follies in 1918, 1922, and 1923 and the Midnight Frolics of 1919, 1920, and 1921. While she never was made a principal dancer with the Follies, from 1918 onwards, she also worked as an assistant to choreographer Ned Wayburn. In April 1923 Eaton starred in Plunder at Poli's Majestic Theater in New York City. On one occasion she filled in for Marilyn Miller in a Ziegfeld chorus when the star had the mumps. Eaton was reputed to have the most beautiful legs in America. It was reported that each time Ziegfeld encountered Eaton he asked her, \\"How are the legs?\\". After her final appearance with the Follies, in the 1923 road company, Eaton became associated with producer Charles Dillingham, becoming the only female musical comedy producer in New York at that time. She worked on Dillngham's productions for several years, both as a performer and a dance director. During this period she was a popular and respected presence on Broadway, and was even honored with a caricature on the walls at the theatrical restaurant Sardi's. Her final Broadway show was She's My Baby at the Globe Theatre in 1928. In the late 1920s Eaton moved to Los Angeles and worked as a dance director and choreographer for RKO Studios, where her first film was Street Girl (1929). She created dances for such films as Hit the Deck with Jack Oakie, and RKO's largest hit of the decade, the Ziegfeld musical extravaganza, Rio Rita. She was selected by Hungarian artist Erno Bakos for a portrait of the most typical American blonde, in December 1928. Bakos studied stage and screen beauties and went to both Vassar and Smith College in his search for an ideal girl. He believed Eaton possessed the perfect combination of beauty, intelligence, personality, charm, and spirit.Indiana, Pennsylvania Evening Gazette, Owner of Prettiest Legs Picked Also As Typical American By Bakos, December 24, 1928, Page 3. 1930s and beyond Pearl, along with the rest of her family, found her career in sharp decline during the Great Depression. In spite of her well-respected work at RKO, she was let go by the studio in 1930. She continued performing in motion pictures throughout the 30s, albeit in small roles. In July 1931, she began teaching at the Ernest E. Ryan School of Dancing. Eaton also dabbled in various other careers, opening a dance studio, writing songs and stories, training to be a realtor, and working for the Los Angeles County Census Bureau. As with several of her siblings, she also battled alcoholism and dependence on prescription drugs. After the death of her second husband, oil company executive Richard Curtis ‚ÄúDick‚Äù Enderly, she became reclusive and rarely left her home. Pearl Eaton was found dead, at the age of 60, in her Manhattan Beach apartment on September 10, 1958. While the police investigation ruled that the death was a homicide, the case was never solved.

The first US edition appeared under the title The Complete Compleat Enchanter, and replaces the foreword with a preface by David Drake. That edition was published by Baen Books in 1989, and has been reprinted a number of times since. Orion Books published an edition in the UK under the title The Compleat Enchanter in 2000 as volume 10 of their Fantasy Masterworks series.

Situated in Phyllis Township, the mine produced 34,000,000 dollars Canadian with 80 million pounds of copper, 230,028 ounces of silver and 13,271 ounces of gold. It was considered to be the largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada. A mill was not initially needed because the ore was 28% copper. The mine closed in 1972 and is now flooded by water. Ruins of the Copperfields mill are present as foundations. It is possible to find mineral specimens in the spoil heaps of the old mine, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, malachite, dolomite, hessite, merenskyite, millerite, palladium, quartz and others. The Lake Temagami Access Road was created to ship ore from the mine site. Copper-nickel mineralization at the mine is associated with semi-massive to disseminated pyrite at the lower contact between altered gabbro and rhyolite of the Temagami Greenstone Belt. The gabbro is steeply dipping, approximately 250 m thick and has a strike extent of at least 5 km. The intensity of mineralization varies greatly but is present over most of the defined strike length of the gabbro. Copper is associated with chalcopyrite.

Coming at the height of the McCarthy era in the US, the six musicians - Ruth Budd, Dirk Keetbaas, William Kuinka, Abe Mannheim, John Moskalyk, and Steven Staryk - were denied visas on the suspicion of being involved in communist activities. The TSO sent other musicians in their place and completed its tour. The six musicians resumed playing with the orchestra upon its return to Canada. At the end of the 1951-1952 season, the TSO refused to renew the contracts of these musicians, stating that they had not fulfilled their contractual agreements. The six musicians appealed this decision to its union, the Toronto Musicians' Association; the Mayor of Toronto; the Canadian Civil Liberties Association; and many other bodies, without success. They received support from the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts, but not from the Canadian Congress of Labour. The incident garnered extensive media coverage in both Canada and the United States, and sparked a protest against the TSO's decision. The orchestra's director, Ernest MacMillan, did not speak about the matter in public, which also prompted criticism, and two members of the TSO board resigned. The six musicians were viewed with suspicion by their colleagues and people avoided them to protect themselves from guilt by association. Budd and Staryk later returned to the TSO, while the four other musicians continued their careers elsewhere. Background The Toronto Symphony Orchestra was founded by Luigi von Kunits in 1922. From 1931 to 1956 it was conducted by Sir Ernest MacMillan, who achieved renown as \\"the leading figure in Canadian music\\". By the 1940s the orchestra's popularity had increased, but its financial condition did not allow it to tour or invite many guest conductors and soloists. In 1951-52 it received CA$56,000 in donations and grants, CA$10,000 less than the amount raised by the smaller Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Some TSO musicians freelanced for the CBC Symphony Orchestra and a few left the TSO to work for the CBC. MacMillan hoped that the TSO could boost its reputation through international engagements. Event alt=A photograph of the Detroit Masonic Temple The Toronto Symphony Orchestra was invited to perform at the Detroit Masonic Temple auditorium on November 27, 1951 as part of the Major Symphony Series, which also featured the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. TSO director MacMillan viewed this first-ever US invitation as a golden opportunity to garner more international invitations for the orchestra. He added vocal soloist Lois Marshall to the orchestra, as well as a piece by an American composer, Herbert Elwell's work Pastorale, and Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, to the repertoire. At this time in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, generating fear and suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required to submit to United States immigration authorities all the names of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. The immigration department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One of the musicians was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry. These six musicians, who became known as the Symphony Six, were: *Ruth Budd, double bassist. Born in Winnipeg, she joined the TSO in 1947, becoming Canada's first professional female bassist. *Dirk Keetbaas, Jr., principal flautist. Born in the Netherlands, Keetbaas was a naturalized Canadian citizen. He also performed in the CBC Symphony Orchestra and in chamber music groups. He joined the TSO in 1949. *William Kuinka, double bassist. Born in British Columbia, he had served in the Second World War. He was self-taught in mandolin and guitar as well. The 1951-1952 season was his first and last year in the TSO. *Abe Mannheim, bassist. This was his fourth season with the orchestra. Immigration officials had questioned him for 4 hours. *John Moskalyk, violinist. He joined the TSO in 1945. *Steven Staryk, violinist. Born in Toronto, he studied violin as a child with, among others, John Mosklyk, and performed in his first recital on CBC Radio at the age of 14. He joined the TSO in 1950 when he was still in his teens. Several of the six musicians had been involved with Canadian-Russian friendship organizations formed in the 1940s for the purposes of artistic collaboration; however, they denied charges of political involvement. Staryk related that he had played at Ukrainian and other ethnic events, and Budd admitted to being a member of a left-wing youth group. John Moskalyk's surname was listed in the TSO's programs as \\"Moscow\\"; he had conducted the Budapest orchestra for two concert performances in August 1949. Keetbaas could not recall any association with left-wing groups. Harry Freedman, who was on the board of the Toronto Musicians' Association at the time and whose vote thwarted unanimous decisions against the Symphony Six, stated that he was not aware of any of the six musicians promoting communism. Later, he felt that he should have taken \\"more direct action\\". MacMillan himself had been involved in the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship in the 1940s, though he had since quit that organization. In 1950, with an eye to taking the orchestra on international tours, he had written a letter to the American consul in Toronto admitting his former affiliation. He received his visa in November 1951 without any difficulties. After the six musicians were denied entry and before the orchestra had left for the United States, MacMillan solicited help for them from the Canadian ambassador in Washington, but his plea was unsuccessful. In January 1952 he wrote to US immigration officials trying to clear Staryk's name, lauding him as \\"an exceptionally talented violinist and valuable member of the orchestra. I have no reason to doubt that he has no Communist affiliations other than that he played from ages twelve to fourteen with a Ukrainian orchestra that is under some suspicion\\". His entreaties on behalf of Staryk did not help to exonerate the musician. The TSO board sent other musicians in place of the six who had been denied visas, and the concert went on as planned. The orchestra's performance was a success and received positive reviews from both the American and Canadian press. After the TSO returned to Canada, the six musicians resumed their positions. Refusal to renew contracts At the end of the 1951-1952 season, with more American concerts planned for the orchestra in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia in the coming season, the TSO did not renew its contracts with all six musicians. Jack Elton, manager of the orchestra, discussed the problem of these six players with the TSO board in a meeting held on April 21, 1952. At the meeting, Elton said that \\"for artistic reasons there could be no substitutes for such an important concert\\". The board agreed with Elton's arguments and contended that the six musicians had not fulfilled their contractual agreement to join the orchestra on international tours, and that being barred from entering the United States would prevent them from joining the orchestra in future US appearances. Ernest MacMillan was not present at the meeting. The incident and the board's decision not to renew the musicians' contracts created controversy when it became public, garnering media attention both nationally and internationally. Members of the press castigated the TSO for not cancelling the US tour in protest over the immigration department‚Äôs decision, citing a similar case in which the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam had cancelled its US tour when several of its musicians were denied entry. One reporter, Langford Dixon of The Globe and Mail, \\"defended the six so vehemently that it led to his dismissal from the paper\\". Many people wrote letters to the TSO and some even cancelled their subscriptions. For its part, the TSO board blamed the newly established Canadian television for the unprecedented decline in subscriptions. A letter to the editor of Toronto Daily Star called the firing \\"an offence against Canadian independence.\\" alt=A 1957 photograph of Lester B. Pearson The TSO board gave orchestra manager Jack Elton the authority to decide what steps should be taken. Elton asked the Toronto Musicians' Association to intervene. The union upheld the board's decision. The six musicians appealed but the union turned them down, stating that they had not fulfilled their contractual agreements and so the orchestra had the right not to renew their contracts. Walter Murdoch, president of the Toronto Musicians' Association, said that it was \\"a straight contractual matter\\" and \\"there is nothing wrong in the orchestra's not rehiring musicians\\". On May 26, 1952 twelve members of the TSO board met to review their decision not to renew the contracts. Nine of the members voted in favor of the decision while three voted against it. It was decided that the contracts would not be renewed, but if the United States immigration officials would issue entry permits to the six musicians by September 1, the TSO would renew the contracts. This decision created a controversy and a split within the TSO board, which eventually led to the resignation of two members, Mrs. Edmund Boyd and Mrs. R. B. Whitehead, although these two remained members of the orchestra's women's committee. The Assembly for the Canadian Arts called a rally in support of the Symphony Six on May 29. The Toronto Musicians' Association instructed its members not to attend and sent members to stand outside the entrance \\"to intimidate members from entering\\". Aspersions were cast on the Assembly for the Canadian Arts as being a communist front organization, and the Toronto Evening Telegram called the gathering \\"a communist meeting\\". Several members of the Assembly quit the group in fear \\"of being labelled communists\\". On June 4 the United Church of Canada urged the TSO board to reconsider its decision. The controversy continued into the orchestra's 1952-1953 season. The six musicians appealed again to the TSO board and the Toronto Musicians' Association, but made no headway. The musicians also held meetings with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Toronto Board of Control, and pleaded their case to the Mayor of Toronto, Allan A. Lamport, and the American Federation of Musicians, without success. While the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts supported the six musicians, the Canadian Congress of Labour rejected a proposal to back them. In 1952 then-Canadian foreign minister Lester Pearson was quoted as saying that it would not \\"serve any useful purpose to take the matter up again\\". Pearson blamed the Cold War for such incidents, and added that the Canadian government was also denying entries to people wishing to attend communist meetings and was providing US officials with \\"security information\\". A special committee was set up by the TSO board to screen all its members. MacMillan stayed out of the matter; he did not attend meetings of the TSO board and maintained a public silence through the spring and summer of 1952. According to TSO archivist Warren, MacMillan's correspondence indicates that he supported the board's decision not to rehire the six musicians. While the Symphony Six garnered support from many corners, they did not receive widespread support from their peers. While some orchestra members were \\"genuinely supportive\\", according to Budd, many others publicly shunned them for fear of being perceived as communist sympathizers and losing their own jobs. Aftermath alt=A portrait photograph of Ernest MacMillan Only two of the Symphony Six eventually returned to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra: Ruth Budd and Stephen Staryk. After her contract was not renewed, Budd played with orchestras in Halifax and other Canadian cities. She was rehired by the TSO in 1964 and continued as a double bassist until 1989, becoming \\"one of the most beloved members of the orchestra\\". Staryk played in the CBC Symphony Orchestra from 1952 to 1956 and then traveled to London, where he was appointed concertmaster of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1960 he became concertmaster of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and toured the US with them, although he had not been officially cleared by the US immigration department. Staryk was the first Canadian concertmaster of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1963 to 1967. He returned to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1982, serving as concertmaster until 1986. Keetbaas became the principal flautist for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and the CBC Winnipeg Orchestra from 1953 to 1968. From 1956 to 1966 he directed and performed with the Dirk Keetbaas Players, a wind quintet featuring flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and French horn. Kuinka performed with the Toronto Renaissance Quintet from 1963 to 1965. In 1964 he formed the Toronto Mandolin Chamber Ensemble, which existed until 1969. He also performed with the orchestra of the National Ballet of Canada. He received a research grant from the Canada Council to study European teaching methods and repertoire in 1966. Mannheim later performed in the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. Moskalyk joined the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto and also became a faculty member of The Royal Conservatory of Music. The TSO board had not renewed the musicians' contracts hoping that it would receive more concert invitations from the United States. However, it received only eight invitations in the following four years, all from the state of Michigan. The eighth tour had to be cancelled because of a snowstorm. In a letter written to Dan Cameron, President of the Canadian Federation of Music Teachers, in November 1952, MacMillan reflected that \\"the orchestra, far from suffering musically, has in some respects improved.\\" See also * Human rights in Canada * McCarthyism References Bibliography  * Further reading * Category:Classical music in Canada Category:History of human rights in Canada Category:Canada‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Works about McCarthyism ","title":"Symphony Six"},{"id":"7674266","text":"Don Bosco School Manila (full school name: Don Bosco School (Salesian Sisters), Inc. - Manila, also known as DBS), is an educational institution owned and operated by the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians (FMA), otherwise known as Salesian Sisters of St. John Bosco . It was founded in 1989. DBS has its own informational handbook which comprises the guidelines and all other information about the school. History Founded in 1989, the Salesian educational institution started its humble operations. Don Bosco Technical College (DBTC) in Mandaluyong City is a pioneer of Salesian Schools in Metro Manila. It belongs to the priests or Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB). DBTC gradually phased out their pre-school and primary levels. DBTC also temporarily transferred some of their primary level faculty to Don Bosco School Manila. The administration and policies applied to this agreement followed the DBTC Manual for students, faculty and staff. The Salesian Sisters Administration of DBS Manila and the Salesian Fathers Administration of DBTC Mandaluyong worked in close supervision and collaboration until April 1993 when the last group of transferees had finished their Grade 4 and enrolled back at DBTC to finish their Intermediate and High school. Faculty members who were temporarily transferred to DBS Manila were offered a choice as to their preferred employer. However, this agreement did not hinder the administration of DBS to start its own co-educational pre-school and grade school levels and to employ directly its new faculty and staff in 1989. In April 1993, DBS Manila and DBTC Mandaluyong finally ended its temporary phase in and phase out agreement. In 1994, the first class of Grade 5 students (all females) started the intermediate level. In 1996, the school held its first Commencement Exercises of its 59 graduates in the Elementary Course. In 2000, the program for the Secondary Education was completed. The school started to accept boys in the Grade 5 level during the school year 2004-2005. These male students were accepted into the secondary level (S.Y. 2006-2007) after a consultation made by the Educating Community Core Group. The results of the consultation showed that majority of prefer to send their in DBS until they finish their secondary school.

It has the shape of a truncated cone, usually made of black or embroidered felt, cotton or velvet. It is also worn by males in formal occasions such as weddings and funerals or festive occasions such as the Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha holidays. In Indonesia, the peci is also associated with the nationalist movement. Names Murad Ebrahim, Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, southern Philippines It is called \\"songkok\\" in the Ethnic Malay cultural sphere in Malay Archipelago. While in Java, it is called \\"kopiah\\" or \\"kopeah\\". It is also known widely in Indonesia as \\"peci\\", although peci has a more ellipse shape and sometimes decorated. The name \\"peci\\" was probably derived from the Dutch word petje means literary \\"small hat\\", or possibly derived from the Turkish fez instead. All names refer to the same object. Origin Men of the Royal Malay Regiment (Rejimen Askar Melayu DiRaja) wearing songkok at bayonet practice, Singapore Island (1941). The origin of the songkok can be traced to the fez, which was adopted by the Ottomans in 1826 and subsequently spread to South Asia and to the Malay Archipelago (now called Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei). The songkok used to be worn during the Ottoman Empire and in some parts of Africa. However this may only be part true, as the words themselves can be traced earlier. Kopiah is recorded as being used by Majapahit elite troops (Bhayangkara). Kupiah is recorded in Pigafetta's Italian-Malay vocabulary of 1521. One Brunei newspaper account erroneously states that the songkok became a norm in Malay Archipelago in the 13th century with the coming of Islam in the region. The earliest written mention of the word songkok is in Syair Siti Zubaidah (1840).Syair Siti Zubaidah MCP text While traditional triangular Malay headress of Tengkolok or destar is associated with traditional Malay nobles and royalties, songkok on the other hand has become part of traditional Malay men's costume associated with Islam, traditionally worn by local ulamas. The Royal Malay Regiment of the Malaysian Army have been using the songkok as part of their uniform since under British rule. Current use EWP Tambunan, a Christian, was known for his habit of wearing red songkok. Female version of peci with curved back, worn by Indonesian flag raising girls squad (Paskibra). Traditionally songkok are associated with Muslim men's cap. However, in Indonesia, the songkok has become the national headress with secular nationalist connotations made popular by Sukarno. Numbers of Indonesian nationalist movement activist in early 20th century wore peci such as Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, and Agus Salim. However, as the first president of Indonesia it was Sukarno that popularised peci ‚Äî more precisely plain black velvet peci ‚Äî as national men's cap of Indonesian, and Indonesian male presidents have worn peci as part of their official presidential attire ever since. Indonesian official palace guards also wore peci as part of their uniform. The Paskibraka (Indonesian: pasukan pengibar bendera pusaka) or flag raising squad in Indonesian independence day ceremony also wear peci, and there is even female peci version with curved back. The Betawi people wear the Songkok as their traditional headdress usually colored dark red. In Malaysia, traditional male Malay attire consists of a songkok, shirt, matching pants, and waist wrap that is called a baju melayu. In a Dewan Undangan Negeri or in Dewan Rakyat, a member is required to wear the songkok to comply with the dress code of the assembly. In Singapore, the songkok is not allowed to be worn in government schools as part of the uniform as Singapore is officially a secular state and all religious headgear is not allowed to be worn. It is part of the standard uniform at madrasahs (Islamic religious schools). In the Philippines, the songkok, known as kopiah or kupya, plays a role in the heraldry of the Sultanate of Sulu, and is part of the traditional wear of Bangsamoro men. It is worn by Bangsamoro and other Filipino Muslim men throughout the archipelago as a formal cap for prayers, and for religious and social functions.

It is located a few minutes west of London, Ontario northeast of Delaware, Ontario. It hosts stock car racing every Friday night during the summer. The track opened in 1952 as a quarter- mile dirt track that was paved in 1960. In August 1969, the track was expanded to a 1/2 mile paved oval and continues today.  Divisions  The track hosts seven different divisions as part of its home classes (Late Model, Modified, Street Stock, Truck, Enduro, Junior Late Model) as well as one entry-level class, the Bone Stock Chaos Cars. They also host the King of the Hill spectators races. = Late Model = Late Model Late Models are purpose-built race cars. They are the fastest weekly class at the speedway and drivers in the series make occasional trips to other speedways in the province for large special events. The signature event for the Late Models is \\"The Great Canadian Race\\" held annually. = Super Stock = Delaware Super Stock This class is made up of mid-1970s through mid-1980s North American vehicles. The cars are sometimes described as \\"The Late Model of Yesterday\\" in reference to their similar look to the old Late Model class. The cars have been modified with safety and performance in mind but still retain a stock frame, body and many chassis components. The division was known as the \\"Street Stock\\" class until its name was changed to \\"Super Stock\\" several races into the 2007 season. The change occurred as a result of gradual improvements to the quality of the cars in recent years and the signing of a new sponsor to the division. The speedway announced that more modern muscle car body packages will be introduced for the 2011 season including Dodge Challenger, Chevrolet Camaro, and Ford Mustang. = Trucks = Delaware Trucks racing in practice in 2006 Considered an entry level class that is a proving ground for future street stock, modified or late model drivers. The trucks use automatic transmissions to be easier to drive. The trucks were the largest division at the speedway in the 2005‚Äì2006 seasons before being regularly overtaken by the Super Stock class. By 2010, the Super Stocks and Trucks had comparable vehicle counts a trend which continued through the 2011 season. = Enduro = Enduro The endurance division runs on a separate day from the regular divisions with an emphasis on staying out and making as many laps as possible. The division sees upwards of 80 drivers competing at the same time on the track. The minimum length for an enduro race during its prime was 250 laps. Several times a year the top drivers face off in a Friday 25-lap format \\"All-Star Race\\" or \\"Challenge\\" event. At its height in the mid-1990s the enduro class boasted races of almost 200 cars competing in a single race. Today's enduro car has evolved from the original in significant safety strides but experienced a decline in vehicle count to between 60-80 cars. Many drivers and fans have offered different explanations for the decline, but many see the decrease in cars a result of lower availability of affordable rear-wheel drive V-8 cars which were used cars that were available in the early 1990s. Speedway officials hinted during the 2008 season that steps were going to be taken to correct imbalances in the class. The result was the \\"Next-Generation\\" program which introduced a separate payout for drivers running cars with six or less cylinders, the introduction of 30-lap heat races and a 150-lap main event. The program did not see significant changes in vehicle count as a result of the \\"Next-Generation\\" program or format changes, but counts remained stable. In the 2011 season officials have signaled their intention to revisit the \\"Next-Generation\\" program and make adjustments to the class aimed at improving the class. Minor format tweaks were introduced which allowed for a tighter restart format and improvements to rookie driver incentive programs. = Junior Racing League = The Junior Racing League races on Wednesday nights on a special roadcourse in the infield. The drivers (aged 8‚Äì17) years old race 1/2 scale late model stock cars. The program was formerly known as the \\"CASCAR Junior Program\\" and was founded in 1997. Racing is divided into two divisions - Junior (8‚Äì12 years old) and Senior (13‚Äì17 years old). The program has seen many drivers graduate to higher divisions in racing, including J.R. Fitzpatrick. = Chaos Cars / Bone Stocks = In an effort to create an easy entry level and add additional entertainment value to the track, the speedway announced in the 2008 Rule package the introduction of a 4-cylinder \\"Chaos Car\\". The division was developed by track announcer John Houghton. The class ran in \\"Novelty\\" type events before Enduro races and occasionally at the conclusion of the Friday program. Over ten different vehicles were entered into competition in the first year. Race courses included \\"barrel turns\\" where drivers had to drive 360 degrees around a barrel before continuing, weaving cones, stop boxes as well as small launch ramps in the season finale. The inaugural \\"Chaos Car\\" champion in 2008 was \\"SnotRod\\", built by Mark Thyssen and piloted by Tyssen Toll. In 2009, Spencer Rabideau in \\"Bush Bomb\\" claimed the title at the season finale in which nine drivers competed. The car count held steady into the beginning of the 2010 season, which finished the year with 12 vehicles competing in the finale in which the championship was won by \\"Blue Thunder\\". The 2011 season built on the success regularly starting more than 10 drivers and finishing the year with 15 drivers at the season finale. The series experienced the largest single-day growth of a division in speedway history with the introduction of the \\"Bone Stock\\" format, which updated the Chaos Car rules to fit an old-school 1990's Enduro-type race. The Bone Stock 75 made its debut on October 15, 2011 in which 30 drivers arrived to compete, nearly doubling the size of the division. = Modified = Modified The modified class is similar to the Late Model class but are open wheeled. The maximum speed of the cars is slightly slower than their late model counterparts. The class struggled for drivers in the early 2000s (decade), but briefly bounced back in the years that followed with the introduction of a more aggressive body style, as well as increased participation in invitational events. By the end of the 2009 season the number of drivers participating dropped to below 10 cars per race. The collapse in count left the speedway and drivers searching for a solution for the open-wheel class. In 2010 the speedway reduced the number of races for the Open Wheel Modifieds in hopes of making the competition more affordable. The drivers formed an association known as the MRA (Modified Racing Association) with the goal of promoting Open-Wheel racing in Ontario. At their first invitational held at Sauble Speedway on July 3, 2010, the MRA drew 23 competitors. The MRA continued to enjoy strong success in invitational events throughout the 2011 season, however, struggled to find competitors for weekly events held at the track. After 21 years as a weekly series with a home track schedule, in 2012 the division was discontinued as a weekly class. The modifieds continue to run at the speedway at special invitational events. History = Opening (1952) = The track was opened in 1952 by Hugh Brodie as a 1/4 mile dirt track and operated as such until it became a 1/4 paved oval in 1960. Expansion to its present-day 1/2 mile paved track configuration took place in 1969. = Super Modifieds (1970s) = The 1/2 Mile asphalt surface is said to have been specifically built to accommodate super modified racing. The \\"Supers\\" raced at the speedway from the 1970s through the 1980s before being dropped from the racing card and replaced with Super Late models. Super Modified racing did not return to Delaware Speedway until 2006 when the International Supermodified Association (ISMA) touring series made a stop. The series continues to attend the track each season, currently running two-day race weekends. = CASCAR era (1981‚Äì2005) = The history of CASCAR and Delaware Speedway are very closely connected together. Delaware is widely recognized as the \\"Birthplace of CASCAR\\". The promoter of CASCAR, Tony Novotny was simultaneously promoter of both CASCAR Operations and Delaware Speedway before selling the track in 2001. The track hosted CASCAR Super Series races from 1986 until 2005 when Delaware Speedway dropped CASCAR from its schedule in the same year the track left the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series after a two-year membership. The reason for the drop was delays in the delivery of the CASCAR schedule, prompting Delaware to fill the 2 annual CASCAR dates with its own events. Observers also cited strained relations between the track and CASCAR over the series' operations being controlled by its impending buyer NASCAR. All of the CASCAR Super Series' races in 1986 were held at the track, Ken Johnston was the champion. = NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series (2004‚Äì2005) = Delaware Speedway became the first Canadian track to be a member of the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series in the 2004 season. At the conclusion of the 2005 racing season, the speedway cancelled its NASCAR sanctioning at the same time as it dropped its CASCAR Super Series events. During the period after a series of rainouts and under the NASCAR rules at the time, the speedway was forced to run a number of double feature nights to make the minimum number of races required under the NASCAR program. With double feature nights increasing the weekly payout and not increasing the number of fans, the speedway reconsidered its place within NASCAR. = Independent period (2006‚Äì2008) = Following the end of NASCAR sanctioning the speedway management set about a focus on building the profile of its weekly racing programs. The track worked with the Ontario-based inter-speedway organization Weekend Warrior Series (WWS) in an attempt to increase travel between Ontario-based speedways and also introduced new Late Model events such as the annual Canada Day PartSource 140 and giving the former CASCAR 300-lap Labour Day race to the division. At the beginning of the 2007 racing season the track General Manager and Operations Director resigned from the speedway. Jeff Wilcox was put in place as Operations Manager and the 2007 race season went ahead as scheduled. Wilcox would remain operations manager until the conclusion of his term at the end of the 2008 racing season. = New ownership and return to NASCAR (2009‚Äì2011) = On January 21, 2009 the speedway formally announced that one of the business's part owners, Arlen Scherba, had bought out the other business partners to become the sole owner of the speedway business. In the same release, the track announced its return NASCAR weekly sanctioning under the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series banner. The release also indicated that the speedway land lease was no longer a concern. A new operations manager had been put in place before the new year, Paul Houghton, who had previously directed the track's Junior Racing League (JRL) program. Jeff Wilcox continued his role as Race Director, and John Houghton continued as Public Relations manager. Joe Czernai would later be added as the track's general manager, part way through the season. The speedway successfully executed its first NASCAR Canadian Tire Series event on Saturday, June 6, 2009 and repeated the event one year later on June 5, 2010. D.J. Kennington was the winner of both events. The 2009 season also featured numerous track renovations including repaving the majority of the front stretch, new corner lights, and electronic timing and scoring as well as a new ticketing system. The 2010 Delaware Speedway season schedule was similar to that of 2009, with the addition of a special Summer Showdown featuring NASCAR drivers Kyle Busch, David Reutimann, and Jason Leffler. The event was won by Kyle Busch and was his first win in Canada. The 2010 schedule reduced the Open Wheel Modified series to a smaller schedule as part of retooling efforts for the weekly program, while increasing the number of races for Late Models, Super Stocks, and Trucks. In 2011, the track hosted a NASCAR Whelen Modified event in September. It also announced plans to expand seating capacity by 600 and replace a number of grandstands to accommodate larger events, but the installation of those grandstands was put on hold shortly after the announcement to make additional preparations. Ron Sheridan, champion in the track's Late Model class, took over as race director in December 2010. = DeMelo‚ÄìSpivak partnership (2012‚Äìpresent) = On December 1, 2011, Arlen Scherba withdrew as owner of the track and the DeMelo and Spivak families became owners of the speedway. The change in ownership was considered historically significant as it represented the first time the lease-holding Spivak family was to have a direct interest in the speedway business. = Speedway museum = In celebration of the track's 60th Anniversary in 2011, a speedway museum was opened in the base of the track's broadcast tower. The exhibition included original programs from the opening of the speedway, original posters, as well as reproductions of photos and other items.

Written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Andy Kubert, the story was published in four parts in the comic book Batman starting in #655 and ending in #658. The story was the beginning of Morrison's run in the Batman comic as well as his long-term take on the character of Batman through multiple titles over the next seven years. The arc introduced Batman's son, Damian Wayne, bringing him into the mainstream continuity of the DC Universe. Morrison was hired by DC editors to give his take on Batman after having recently given his definitive take on the character of Superman in All Star Superman. In writing the arc, he took ideas from past Batman stories, especially the 1987 story Batman: Son of the Demon. Morrison brought back the idea of a son, Damian, being born from a love affair between Batman and Talia al Ghul, the daughter of his nemesis, Ra's al Ghul. The boy had been trained from birth by the League of Assassins and was sent by Talia to live with Batman in a plot to disrupt his crime-fighting and distract him. It also includes the use of sometime Batman adversary, Dr. Kirk Langstrom and the serum he uses to become the creature Man-Bat. The arc served as the beginning of Morrison's Batman run and was followed by a prose story about the Joker in Batman #663 and then the fan-named story arc The Three Ghosts of Batman (Batman #664‚Äì666). These two arcs and the Joker story were ultimately collected together in trade paperback form since many elements introduced in the first arc were used and expanded upon in the second arc. The story had a lasting impact on the DC Universe, introducing the character of Damian who would go on to co-star in two on-going monthly series for DC and appear in other comic books frequently. Background The character of Batman was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane. He was introduced in the anthology comic book series Detective Comics #27 in May 1939 published by National Allied Publications (later renamed DC Comics), though at the time was referred to as \\"The Bat-Man\\". The character was quickly deemed a success, and followed Superman's lead with the debut of a second on-going self-named title. Batman #1 premiered in spring 1940. The two titles quickly added new characters to the Batman mythos, including the Detective Comics #38 debut of a sidekick for Batman, Robin. Super-villains and other nemeses for the duo were created as well, with Talia al Ghul introduced in Detective Comics #411, and her father, Ra's al Ghul in Batman #232. The cast of characters in Batman expanded over the years as characters evolved and left for their own comic books. The original Robin left to become his own character, Nightwing, in 1984, and new characters took over the secret identity of Robin throughout the years. In 2005, the character of Tim Drake was Robin. In that year, the miniseries Infinite Crisis was released. The series was a crossover event of all of the characters of the DC Universe, and had universe-changing consequences. At the end of the series, Batman decides that he needs to focus on keeping his family safe and close, so leaves Gotham City with Nightwing, Robin, and his butler Alfred Pennyworth for a year. After his return, he adopts Tim Drake, formally making him his son in the storyline Batman: Face the Face. Batman also had many interactions with the al Ghul family through the years. Early in their interactions it was established that Talia would be a love interest for Batman even against her father's wishes. Ra's eventually decides that Batman is the perfect mate for his daughter, and after a test where Batman saves her from apparent kidnappers, he considers the two married despite Batman's objections. This idea was later explored in 1987's Batman: Son of the Demon, where the two have a child, Damian. Though the story was never in continuity, themes and plot points from it would be used in other stories. In the 2003 story, Batman: Death and the Maidens, Ra's is apparently killed and Talia psychologically tortured until she disavows her love of Batman. After the story, Talia was portrayed more as Batman's enemy than his lover. Production Senior editor at DC Comics, Peter Tomasi, was the editor of the Batman books in 2006. He was supposed to be the editor of Grant Morrison's Superman story, All Star Superman, however when that changed and he was exclusively on Batman, he decided to work with Morrison. Tomasi spoke with DC's executive editor, Dan Didio and convinced him to hire Morrison for the main Batman book. Morrison had previously worked with the character of Batman in the graphic novel Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, where he explored the psyches of Batman and a number of his enemies,Morrison, Grant. Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth 15th Anniversary Edition (DC Comics, 2005) . and in the storyline, Batman: Gothic, where he created a story about the past of Gotham City and Batman himself, coupled with his modern re- defining of Batman in his lengthy JLA run. Morrison would used these previous stories to conceive his new Batman arc which would eventually lead into, as well as become Batman R.I.P.. Morrison told Didio what he was working towards, and when Didio agreed to his ideas, Morrison used Batman and Son to start to work towards this story. After Morrison was chosen as writer, an artist was needed. It was decided that he would be paired with Andy Kubert, who had started his career at DC Comics and had just signed a three-year exclusive contract with the company. Plot Cover from Batman #658, the concluding issue of Batman and Son. Art By Andy Kubert. The story begins in medias res as the Joker has managed to poison Commissioner Gordon and is crouched over what appears to be a bloody and beaten Batman. As Joker gloats over his \\"victory\\", the beaten Batman pulls out a handgun and manages to shoot the Joker in the face. At that moment, the real Batman appears and captures the Joker, throwing him into a dumpster. When he later visits a recovering Gordon in the hospital, he learns that in his short time back in Gotham, he has managed to rid the city of supercrime. In the Batcave, Alfred tells Batman that he has been so focused on his war on crime that he has started to lose touch with his Bruce Wayne identity. Robin states that he believes a vacation away from Gotham could be beneficial, so Batman decides to attend a charity event at the London Pop Art museum where he can spend time rejuvenating the playboy Bruce Wayne identity. Although he is troubled by a quick meeting by Dr. Kirk Langstrom, the former Man-Bat, he attends the party talking with a myriad of women. One woman that intrigues him is millionaire Jezebel Jet, former supermodel and newly named leader of a small African country. They chat for a while before she claims that she does not want to be one of Bruce Wayne's conquests. Meanwhile, Langstrom is confronted by Talia al Ghul, who threatens that if he does not give his Man- Bat serum to the League of Assassins she will poison his wife Francine, rendering her blind and crippled. While Bruce is at the party, Kirk and Francine are thrown out the back of a van in front of Alfred. He asks them what is wrong, and Kirk tells him that Talia now has the Man-Bat serum. Inside, the party is interrupted as an army of ninja Man-Bats attacks. Bruce changes to his Batman costume and faces down the army in an effort to save the attendants of the gala until he is rendered unconscious. When he awakens, he finds himself in front of Talia, who explains to him that he is the father of her son Damian. Batman and Damian return to Gotham City where the Dark Knight introduces his son to the Batcave, Alfred, and his adopted son, Tim. Damian is immediately hostile towards Tim, as he believes he alone is truly Batman's son and rightful heir. His petulant attitude gets him locked up in one of Wayne Manor's many rooms, but he easily escapes. Later, Tim is searching for Alfred (who has been locked in a room by Damian) in the Batcave when he comes across Damian, armed with a sword that Batman had taken from him. Suspicious, Tim tries to befriend Damian when the younger child reveals that he went out and beheaded a criminal known as the Spook, and placed a grenade in his mouth. Shocked, Tim yells at Damian that killing is not their way. Damian responds by tossing the head in the air, which explodes when it hits the ground. The two spar until Tim helps Damian off the snapping Tyrannosaurus rex jaws. Damian then punches out Tim and takes Jason Todd's displayed Robin costume with him. Later, the Bat-Signal is lit and Batman finds Damian wearing the costume. Batman asks how he got out of the Batcave without being seen and then asks what he has done with Tim. Back at the cave, Batman cares for Tim and reluctantly agrees to take Damian with him to stop Talia and save the British Prime Minister's wife, when Damian reveals he has worked out that Talia wishes to trade her hostage for control over Gibraltar. Batman wants to keep Damian under his control, as he realized that Talia sent him with Batman to cause havoc in his life. The two soon reach Gibraltar where they confront Talia. Damian appeals to both of them that he wants them all to be a family, but Britain's Royal Navy bomb the ship on where they are fighting. Batman escapes, while Talia and Damian vanish in an explosion. Aftermath After the four- issue interlude Batman: Grotesk, Morrison returned with the prose story \\"The Clown at Midnight\\" in Batman #663. The story was acclaimed and called one of the definitive Joker stories. Den of Geek called it one of 10 essential Joker stories, and it was revealed that Heath Ledger read the story to help him become the character for the film, The Dark Knight. Many of the plot points in the story were used later in Morrison's run during the story arc Batman R.I.P. when the Joker would return. Morrison's next three issues have been called by the title of the first one, in Batman #664, The Three Ghosts of Batman. The ghosts referred to in the title were three individuals who wear variants of Batman's costume and take his crime fighting to the extreme. The first was the fake Batman who shot the Joker in Morrison's first issue. Later in that issue, he had been revealed to be an ex-cop who had become a vigilante. The second ghost showed up in #664 when a pimp that had been supplying an ex-policeman who lived on an abandoned facility with prostitutes told Batman that the women turned up dead. Batman tracked him down and was severely beaten by the man, who was dressed in a mixture of Batman's and Bane's costumes. Batman suspected the imposter had used Hugo Strange's monster serum and daily Venom shots to gain his size and strength. Batman is able to stop this ghost with Robin's help. He tells Alfred of a vision he had of three ghost Batmen who had taken his crime-fighting to the extreme limits. He had written of these visions in The Black Casebook and knew after these encounters that he may have to revisit the strange cases in the book. The third Batman was introduced in a future story in Batman #666. The story is presented as a possible future where Damian has taken over the job as Batman. Police Commissioner Barbara Gordon blames him for the death of Bruce Wayne and wants him arrested while Damian is pursuing the third ghost, who claims to be the Antichrist. Damian eventually kills the man by snapping his neck, after battling him at the Hotel Bethlehem. In Morrison's next story arc, Batman takes Robin with him to the Island of Mister Mayhew where he learns that the organization the Black Glove is out to kill him. After a two-issue interlude in the Batman title crossover The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul, the true history of the three ghosts is revealed. The third ghost showed up at police headquarters looking for Commissioner Vane and killed a number of officers. Batman, who had started a love affair with Jezebel Jet as Bruce Wayne, was attacked by the ghost on the roof of the headquarters. His heart stopped and he had visions of old cases of his which had many unexplained phenomena as well as a vision of Joe Chill, the thief who had murdered his parents when he was a child. When he awoke from the visions, he was a captive of the ghost. As the man talked to him, Batman remembered from where the ghosts had come. What Batman thought was a hallucination turned out to be a forgotten memory in which three men were chosen from the police force to train with Batman to replace him should anything ever happen to him. During the test, Batman had himself isolated so that a Doctor Simon Hurt could study what drives him. When the three replacement Batmen came in to challenge him, Batman took them down easily. Dr. Hurt decided that the three Batmen needed to be driven by rage and sorrow to become like Batman. The first, Josef Muller, was an ace marksman as a cop, but had both hands broken by Batman in their fight causing him to have to retire. Hurt killed the third man's, whose name was Lane, family, and began adding Venom and monster serum to Branca, the second man's, diet until he was driven to kill his own family in rage. Doctor Hurt put hypnotic suggestions into Batman's head to help him forget the whole experience and dismiss it as a bad dream. The three replacement cops were hidden away to await the day they would return. Batman is eventually able to escape, but Lane warns him that Hurt is after him and his luck would soon be gone. In recent events, Lane was revealed to be Michael Washington Lane. He became the new Azrael, the agent of the Order of Purity, a splinter group of the Order of Saint Dumas, in Azrael: Death's Dark Knight #1. In keeping with his imitation of Batman, he wears the \\"Suit of Sorrows\\" given to Bruce Wayne by Talia al Ghul during Batman: The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul. Lane accepts the Order's offer to become Azrael as a way of atoning for his perceived role in the demise of Batman. As Azrael, his mission is to spread \\"God's justice\\" through Gotham City in the chaos resulting from the absence of Bruce Wayne as Batman. Collected editions The story has been collected into a single volume in both hardcover and softcover formats. This volume includes the \\"Three Ghosts of Batman\\" arc as well as the prose Joker story. It covers issues 655-658 and 663-666 of Batman. *Batman and Son (200 pages, hardcover, August 2007, , softcover, July 2008, ) *Batman and Son - An expanded edition was released in 2014, collecting Batman issues #655-658, 663-669 and 672-675.

The movie differs from the comic in many points, making Deathstroke the main antagonist and severely downplaying Talia's and Damian's negative traits. Much of Talia's role in the story arc is adapted to Deathstroke in the movie. Impact and legacy Morrison's first run in Batman has had generally positive reviews, however, the first arc has been called weaker than the second. The issues of Batman and Son were given a B+ grade by Batman-On-Film saying that though the first two issues were well paced and interesting, it suffered from too fast an ending. Tor.com, however, claimed the story began an epic ultimate definition of Batman. In IGN's review of the three issues of The Three Ghosts of Batman arc, they called #672 great, # 673 awesome, and #674 awesome. The storyline was not universally praised, however, with it being called inconsistent, frustrating, and disjointed. The story had a lasting impact on Batman stories as well as the DC Universe as a whole with the introduction of the character of Damian Wayne and the set-up of plot elements in Morrison's stories. Damian would eventually become the fifth Robin and co-star in Morrison's on-going Batman and Robin title since. He has also appeared in other titles, especially those set around Gotham City. Morrison himself knew that the character was hated from the start, but he was glad people warmed to the character and used him in other books. The plot points introduced in the story would be continued throughout Morrison's run on Batman and his continuation in the other Batman titles of which he was head writer.

Early years June Hildegarde Flanner was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Frank Flanner and Mary Ellen Hockett. She had two older sisters, noted journalist Janet Flanner and Marie Flanner, a musician and composer. Frank Flanner was Indiana's first licensed embalmer and in 1881 he founded a company that is still in business as Flanner and Buchanan Funeral Centers. In 1898, Frank Flanner founded the Flanner Guild, a not-for-profit community service center for African-Americans in Indianapolis, now called Flanner House. Later life Hildegarde Flanner attended Sweet Briar College in Virginia before moving to California in 1919 to attend the University of California, Berkeley. At the university, she studied poetry with Witter Bynner and was on the literary staff of The Occident. Flanner was honored with the Emily Chamberlain Cook Prize in 1920 for her poem Young Girl. Along with her mother, Flanner lost her home and most of her possessions in the Berkeley Fire of 1923, prompting them to move to southern California. On June 29, 1926, Flanner married architect and artist Frederick Monhoff and lived in Altadena with their child, John, born in 1941. Hildegarde Flanner continued to write under her maiden name, chronicling events in her life as well as the changing landscape of California in the twentieth century. Flanner's contributions were published in The Nation, The New Republic and Poetry. She was named the New Directions Poet of the Month in 1942. One of their neighbors in Altadena was Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen and in 1977 Flanner's elegy on Nielsen was included in The Unknown Paintings of Kay Nielsen. Flanner and Monhoff spent their later years on their property in Calistoga, Napa Valley, California. Flanner was an avid gardener, with particular interests in ornamental grasses and bamboo. It was thought that Flanner had the largest collection of bamboo varieties in California.

According to published sources, Georgian Byzantine Rite Catholics no longer exist. History Towards the end of the 19th century, when almost all Georgian Catholics were of the Latin Church, some wished to use the Byzantine rite used by the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Russian Tsarist government, which had controlled Georgia since the beginning of that century, made use of that rite exclusive to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Accordingly, some of these Georgians, clergy as well as laity, adopted the Armenian Rite and joined the Armenian Catholic diocese of Artvin, which had been set up in Russian Transcaucasia in 1850. Only after the granting of religious freedom in Russia in 1905 did some Catholics in Georgia adopt the Byzantine rite. Notre Dame de Lourdes, Istanbul In 1861, outside of Georgia, indeed outside of the whole of the Russian Empire, Father Peter Kharischirashvili (P√©tre Kharistshirashvili) founded in Constantinople two religious congregations of the Immaculate Conception, one for men, the other for women. These served Georgian Catholics living in the then capital of the Ottoman Empire. They also served in Montauban, France. These congregations are long extinct, although some of their members were still alive in the late 1950s. The building that housed the male congregation, in Ferik√∂y district, still stands in Istanbul, now in private ownership. Their clergy served a small parish in Constantinople, giving Georgian Catholics in the city the possibility to worship in accordance with the Georgian Byzantine rite. This church, Notre-Dame de Lourdes, is still in service, although in the hands of Italian Catholic priests, gravestones in Georgian can still be seen in its courtyard. In the brief period of Georgian independence between 1918 and 1921, some influential Georgian Orthodox expressed an interest in union with the Church of Rome, and an envoy was sent from Rome in 1919 to examine the situation. As a result of the onset of civil war and Soviet occupation, this came to nothing. History Some have treated Catholics within the Georgian Catholic Church who follow the Byzantine Rite as a separate particular Church with either 1861 or 1917 as the date of reunion with Rome. Methodios Stadnik says that, in the 1930s, they had an Exarch named Fr. Shio Batmanishvili, thus implicitly saying that an apostolic exarchate specifically for Georgians of Byzantine Rite had been established. The Forgotten: Catholics of the Soviet Union Empire from Lenin through Stalin by Father Christopher Zugger says that in the early 1920s nine missionaries of the congregation of the Immaculate Conception in Constantinople, headed by Bishop Shio Batmalashvili (possibly referring to Shio Batmanishvili), came to Georgia to establish the Byzantine Catholic Church there, and that by 1929 the community had grown to 8,000. By then the Byzantine Catholic Mission had come to an end with the arrest in 1928 of Bishop Batmalashvili and the murder of his priests. Bishop Batmalashvili himself was executed in 1937. Nevertheless, Zugger cites a report that by 1936 \\"the Byzantine Catholic Church of Georgia had two communities, served by a bishop and four priests, with 8,000 believers\\", figures very similar to what elsewhere he gives as the 1929 situation. Zugger does not state that the Georgian Byzantine Catholics were ever formally established as an autonomous particular Church, and no mention of the erection of such a jurisdiction for Byzantine Georgian Catholics exists in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, the official gazette of the Holy See. There is no evidence therefore that the Georgian Catholics of Byzantine Rite constituted at any time an autonomous (sui iuris) Church, since canon 27 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches defines these Churches as under a hierarchy of their own and recognized as autonomous by the supreme authority of the Church. Until 1994, the annual publication Catholic Almanac used to list \\"Georgian\\" among the Byzantine Rites or autonomous particular Churches. This was abandoned in 1995.

He moved to Herkimer, New York in 1792 with his friend Thomas R. Gold, with whom he practiced law. Griswold was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1796 to 1798. Griswold was elected as a Federalist to the Eighth Congress, holding office from March 4, 1803 to March 3, 1805. During his term Griswold played a leading role in drafting and passing the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. During the 1804 election for Governor of New York between Morgan Lewis and Aaron Burr, both Democratic-Republicans, Burr actively courted the support of Federalists. Griswold authored a private letter advocating that Federalists support Burr, arguing that it was the best way to keep the Federalist Party viable for future elections. Griswold's letter was eventually made public, and appeared in an 1807 handbill accusing the Federalists of unseemly political intriguing, to the party's detriment.

At the time of his death on 8 June 2012 he was the (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics at the University of Adelaide. Early life Pearce was born in Wellington. His early schooling was in Wellington and he was dux of Hutt Valley High School in 1957. He earned his Bachelor of Science (a double major in Applied and Pure Mathematics and a further double major in Physics and Mathematical Physics) and in 1962 he earned a Masters of Science with first class honours in Mathematics, all from Victoria University of Wellington. The bachelor's degree was from the University of New Zealand, as the constituent colleges of UNZ, of which Victoria University College was one of four, had proliferated into four autonomous Universities by the time Pearce completed his master's degree. New Zealand origins Pearce always remained proud of his New Zealand origins. Being descended from Maori people, he claimed his New Zealand ancestry was longer than almost all his peers from New Zealand. Pearce is descended from Alexander Gray, one of just five Scots who settled in New Zealand as part of the original and largely strong interest in Maoritanga and claimed ancestral connection to three waka (canoes) in the heke (migration): Aotea, Kurahaupo and Takatimu. His principal tribal connection was with the Ngati Ruanui, based in the southern Taranaki. Life and career In 1963 Pearce left New Zealand for doctoral study at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, under the supervision of Pat Moran. Thereafter followed short stints (1 to 3 years) as lecturer at: ANU; University of Queensland (visiting Professor); Universit√© de Rennes 1, France; and University of Sheffield (1966‚Äì68). He was appointed to the University of Adelaide in 1968 and remained there for the ensuing years, having been promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1971, Reader in 1982 and Professor in 2003. He was a leading figure in the Department of Applied Mathematics there, being appointed in 2005 to the Elder Chair of Mathematics. While at ANU, he met and married Frances (n√©e O'Connor), and they brought up their two daughters, Emma and Ann, in Adelaide.

Pearce's death, www.abc.net.au, 10 June 2012 Pearce's fatal car accident, au.news.yahoo.com Mathematical work He is known for probabilistic and statistical modelling. Pearce published prolifically in the area of probabilistic and statistical modelling and analysis, with strong contributions being made in both theory and practice. His book with Dragomir addresses the fine points of the Hermite‚ÄìHadamard inequality and is published by Kluwer Academic Press. His applied interests included queuing theory, road traffic, telecommunications, and urban planning. With former student Bill Henderson, who followed him from Sheffield to Adelaide, he helped establish the successful Teletraffic Centre in the University of Adelaide. Publications are numerous and include three books, 23 book chapters, and over 300 research articles. With the formation of the Division of Applied Mathematics of the Australian Mathematical society, Pearce soon emerged as a key figure. The most enduring significant role was as Chief Editor of their Applied Mathematics Journal, now called The ANZIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics. The formation of ANZIAM in 1993 was close to Pearce's heart, as it encapsulated the union he espoused of joint activity in Applied Mathematics involving both Australia and New Zealand. He was a strong worker for ANZIAM and it was fitting that this, along with his outstanding research work, was recognised by the award of the ANZIAM Medal in 2001.

He had two siblings, Marytje (or Maria) Van Alen and John Isaac Van Alen. After the death of his father, his mother married Abraham Van Buren in 1776. His mother had five more children with Van Buren,Brooke, p. 481 including Dirckie \\"Derike\\" Van Buren, Jannetje (called \\"Hannah\\" or \\"Jane\\") Van Buren, future U.S. President Martin Van Buren, Lawrence Van Buren, and Abraham Van Buren Jr. Van Alen attended the common schools, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1794. Career After being admitted to the bar in New York, he practiced in Kinderhook, later practicing in partnership with Martin Van Buren. From 1797 to 1801 he was Kinderhook's Town Clerk. New York Evening Post note on Van Alen's successor as surrogate. September 19, 1822. He was a member of the State constitutional convention of 1801, and was a justice of the peace from 1801 to 1804. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1804. Van Alen was surrogate judge of Columbia County from 1804 to 1808. =U.S. Congress= Van Alen was elected to the 10th Congress as a Democratic- Republican, succeeding Henry W. Livingston and holding office from March 4, 1807 to March 3, 1809. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1808 and John Thompson replaced him in the House. =Later career= He later returned to the surrogate judge's position, serving from 1815 until his death. He was succeeded by his half-brother, Abraham A. Van Buren. Personal life Van Alen never married or had children. He died in Kinderhook on May 18, 1822, and was buried at Kinderhook Cemetery.

It was created by member Hawk, an ex-Tech Support worker, in March 2000, originally as a web comic, but quickly grew into a bulletin board for reader submissions, and soon added the ability for members to comment on the submissions. Since then, the site has grown in both membership and content daily, with over 9,000 members and more than 60,000 story submissions. The site was closed after a DDOS attack in April 2015. Submissions to TSC included Tech Stories, Customer Misconceptions, Tech Support Rules, Customer Types, Co- worker Types, Customer E-mails, End User Phrase of the Day (or \\"EUPOTD\\"), Tech Songs, Cool Links, SoapBox, and finally Tech Calls, where actual calls to tech support can be heard. Also, an IRC chatroom exists: channel #TSC on the Nightstar IRC network. Membership in the IRC channel is open to all; it is not restricted to members of the site. Access to most TSC content was unrestricted. Everyone might view it, but only members could add comments, or submit content. What you could submit, and how you could submit it was determined by your level of membership, which was separated into two levels. These levels were \\"Regular Membership\\" (a free membership), and \\"Star Membership\\" (given to members who have made a monetary donation to the site). While all members could post stories, tech support rules, customer misconceptions, customer and co-worker types, e-mails, EUPOTD's (End User Phrase of the Day), and cool links (see below for further details on each type) only Star Members could use HTML formatting when doing so. Star members also gained the ability to post Tech Songs, full access to the complete archive of Tech Calls and ability to post to the SoapBox, a specific area on the main page that everyone could see. Star members Star Members used to have special privileges: *Ability to **Post to the SoapBox **Post Tech Songs **Post a Cool Link of the Day **Include a signature in each post **Use HTML code in posts *Access to **Full Tech Calls archive Also, Star Members' nicknames were preceded by a small yellow star icon. One-year Star Memberships were granted to members who gave a monetary donation to the site. These donations helped to maintain the site. After a year has passed, a Star Member reverted to a Regular Membership. There were two levels of Star Memberships: *US$20 **Included all Star Member benefits *US$35 **Included all Star Member benefits **Included most recent TSC Star Member T-shirt However, the T-shirt option has been suspended. TSC Community Tech Support Comedy members pride themselves on being a strong, close knit community. To this end, they have not only provided tech support to each other, but also emotional support when needed (see karma request section below), whether through submissions, comments, the TSC Forum, chat rooms, or even real world meetings, including group barbecues. Privacy on TSC Privacy is taken quite seriously on TSC. When members submit anything, they make it a point to alter or obliterate any names, e-mail addresses or other identifying information on the posting to something generic. This is done to guard the privacy of all those concerned in the post. For example, members that post to TSC often change their own names to their usernames in posted conversations, replace the name of other parties to starfish, EU or some other amusing (but generic) name, and obliterate the e-mail address and/or phone numbers to something that deliberately leads nowhere, or simply black it out or obscure it. Place of employment is often purposefully omitted or otherwise altered into something very basic and unidentifiable, since a number of companies frown upon any discussion of internal events, and doing so can potentially result in the member being disciplined, including the possibility of being suspended or terminated from their job, should the company discover and identify the person making the post. Karma requests Occasionally, a member may be going through difficulties in their life or job in one form or another, may be interviewing for a big promotion at their job, or may just need a positive boost in their lives, so they put in a karma request. These requests provide a show of support and solidarity for fellow members, since at other times, that member may have given karma to another in a previous karma request. Often, each member has their own unique way of providing karma, and can also provide any advice or assistance as requested/needed. Not only does it show the aforementioned support, but it can also help serve to cheer up the member who posted the request, since the karma delivery can often be done in a very humorous way. Traditionally, after the trouble passes or the tech receives the promotion they interviewed for, the member makes a follow-up post, thanks all who helped, and symbolically returns any unused karma to the pool. DDOS attack In April 2015, Tech Support Comedy suffered a DDOS attack, and as such, the site was temporarily taken down so that Hawk could fix issues caused by the attack. As of August 2015, the site returns only a blank page with the embedded HTML comment \\"Silence Is Golden\\".

Usually for sales/services transactions it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the \\"acquiring bank\\") pays a customer's bank (the \\"issuing bank\\"); and for cash transactions the interchange fee is paid from the issuer to acquirer, often called reverse interchange. In a credit card or debit card transaction, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or independent sales organization (ISO), which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card- issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine). Thus, the Interchange Fee is understood to be mainly the compensation for the Issuing Bank for the statement accumulation period and the post-statement 'Grace Period'. In substance, it is best viewed as the discounting of merchants' receivables until the 'Payment Due Date' when the customer settles the bill either from own sources, or the credit line inherent in the card automatically pays it, and the bank starts charging credit card interest on it. These fees are set by the credit card networks,\\"United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1\\", November 9, 2007. and are the largest component of the various fees that most merchants pay for the privilege of accepting credit cards, representing 70% to 90% of these fees by some estimates, although larger merchants typically pay less as a percentage. Interchange fees have a complex pricing structure, which is based on the card brand, regions or jurisdictions, the type of credit or debit card, the type and size of the accepting merchant, and the type of transaction (e.g. online, in-store, phone order, whether the card is present for the transaction, etc.). Further complicating the rate schedules, interchange fees are typically a flat fee plus a percentage of the total purchase price (including taxes). In the United States, the fee averages approximately 2% of transaction value. In the EU, interchange fees are capped to 0.3% of the transaction for credit cards and to 0.2% for debit cards, while there is no cap for corporate cards. In recent years, interchange fees have become a controversial issue, the subject of regulatory and antitrust investigations. Many large merchants such as Wal- Mart have the ability to negotiate fee prices,The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics James Lyon, Jan. 19, 2006. and while some merchants prefer cash or PIN-based debit cards, most believe they cannot realistically refuse to accept the major card network‚Äìbranded cards. This holds true even when their interchange-driven fees exceed their profit margins.\\"A Puzzle of Card Payment Pricing: Why Are Merchants Still Accepting Card Payments?\\" Fumiko Hayashi, March 2006. Some countries, such as Australia, have established significantly lower interchange fees, although according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office study, the savings enjoyed by merchants were not passed along to consumers.\\"Rising Interchange Fees Have Increased Costs for Merchants, but Options for Reducing Fees Pose Challenges\\", U.S. Government Accountability Office, November 2009 The fees are also the subject of several ongoing lawsuits in the United States. Terminals for swiping credit cards, and origin of the term \\"swipe fee\\" Overview Image from a GAO report explaining how the interchange fee works. Interchange fees are set by the payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. In the US, card issuers now make over $30 billion annually from interchange fees. Interchange fees collected by Visa and MasterCard totaled $26 billion in 2004. In 2005 the number was $30.7 billion, and the increase totals 85 percent compared to 2001. The origins of the interchange fee are a matter of some controversy. Often they are assumed to have been developed to maintain and attract a proper mix of issuers and acquirers to bank networks. Research by Professor Adam Levitin of Georgetown University Law Center, however, indicates that interchange fees were originally designed as a method for banks to avoid usury and Truth-in-Lending laws. Typically, the bulk of the fee goes to the issuing bank. Issuing banks‚Äô interchange fees are extracted from the amount collected by the merchants when they submit credit or debit transactions for payment through their acquiring banks. Banks do not expect to make a significant amount of money from late fees and interest charges from creditworthy customers (who pay in full every month), and instead make their profits on the interchange fee charged to merchants.The World's Most Exclusive Credit Cards Forbes, July 3, 2007. Interchange rates are established at differing levels for a variety of reasons. For example, a premium credit card that offers rewards generally will have a higher interchange rate than do standard cards. Transactions made with credit cards generally have higher rates than those with signature debit cards, whose rates are in turn typically higher than PIN debit card transactions. Sales that are not conducted in person (also known as card-not- present transactions) such as by phone or on the Internet, generally are subject to higher interchange rates, than are transactions on cards presented in person. This is due to the increasing risk and rates of fraudulent transactions. It is important to note that interchange is an industry standard that all merchants are subject to. It is set to encourage issuance and to attract issuing banks to issue a particular brand. Higher interchange is often a tool for schemes to encourage issuance of their particular brand. For one example of how interchange functions, imagine a consumer making a $100 purchase with a credit card. For that $100 item, the retailer would get approximately $98. The remaining $2, known as the merchant discountMerchant account and fees, gets divided up. About $1.75 would go to the card issuing bank (defined as interchange), $0.18 would go to Visa or MasterCard association (defined as assessments), and the remaining $0.07 would go to the retailer's merchant account provider. If a credit card displays a Visa logo, Visa will get the $0.18, likewise with MasterCard. Visa's and MasterCard's assessments are fixed at 0.1100% of the transaction value, with MasterCard's assessment increased to 0.1300% of the transaction value for consumer and business credit volume on transactions of $1,000 or greater. On average the interchange rates in the US are 179 basis points (1.79%, 1 basis point is 1/100th of a percentage) and vary widely across countries. In April 2007 Visa announced it would raise its rate .6% to 1.77%.Visa Hikes Overall Interchange 0.6%, Effective April 14 Digital Transactions, April 12, 2007. Retrieved May 22, 2007. According to a January 2007 poll by Harris interactive, only about a third of the public had heard of interchange fees; once explained to them, 90% said that the United States Congress \\"should compel credit card companies to better inform consumers\\" about the fee. Controversy =Price-fixing= Regulators in several countries have questioned the collective determination of interchange rates and fees as potential examples of price-fixing. Merchant groups in particular, including the U.S.-based Merchants Payments Coalition and Merchant Bill of Rights, also claim that interchange fees are much higher than necessary,Merchants, pay attention to rising credit-card fees Indianapolis Star, May 22, 2007.

Issuing banks argue that reduced interchange fees would result in increased costs for cardholders, and reduce their ability to satisfy rewards on cards already issued. =Consumer welfare= A 2010 public policy study conducted by the Federal Reserve concluded the reward program aspect of interchange fees results in a non- trivial monetary transfer from low-income to high-income households. Reducing merchant fees and card rewards would likely increase consumer welfare.Who Gains and Who Loses from Credit Card Payments? Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, August 31, 2010 The Merchants Payments Coalition is fighting for a more competitive and transparent card fee system that better serves American consumers and merchants alike. Because swipe fees are hidden, consumers are unable to weigh the benefits and costs associated with choosing a particular form of payment.

A proposed settlement received preliminary approval from the judge overseeing the case in November 2012 but the majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and many have vowed to opt out of the settlement.

As a result, banks have begun to limit the incentives offered with their checking account products, and some have announced that they would begin to charge their customers a fee for the use of the cards. In the same month, Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust case focused on the issue of competitiveness in the interchange market. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards, or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards. =European Union= In 2002 the European Commission exempted Visa's multilateral interchange fees from Article 81 of the EC Treaty that prohibits anti-competitive arrangements. However, this exemption expired on December 31, 2007. In the United Kingdom, MasterCard has reduced its interchange fees while it is under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. In January 2007, the European Commission issued the results of a two- year inquiry into the retail banking sector. The report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees. Upon publishing the report, Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the \\"present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified.\\" The report called for further study of the issue. On December 19, 2007, the European Commission issued a decision prohibiting MasterCard's multilateral interchange fee for cross-border payment card transactions with MasterCard and Maestro branded debit and consumer credit cards. The Commission concluded that this fee violated Article 81 of the EC Treaty that prohibits anti-competitive agreements. MasterCard has appealed the Commission's decision before the EU Court of First Instance; while the appeal is pending MasterCard has temporarily repealed its multilateral interchange fees. On March 26, 2008, the European Commission opened an investigation into Visa's multilateral interchange fees for cross- border transactions within the EEA as well as into the \\"Honor All Cards\\" rule (under which merchants are required to accept all valid Visa-branded cards). The antitrust authorities of EU member states other than the United Kingdom are also investigating MasterCard's and Visa's interchange fees. For example, on January 4, 2007, the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection fined twenty banks a total of PLN 164 million (about $56 million) for jointly setting MasterCard's and Visa's interchange fees.http://www.uokik.gov.pl/en/press_office/press_releases/art72.html.

The caps apply only to personal cards where there is an intermediary, not to cards issued to businesses or to cards issued by American Express. =Australia and New Zealand= In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%. One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also removed the \\"no surcharge\\" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards, and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether. In February 2016 the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Payment Surcharges) Act 2016 became law. In 2006, the New Zealand Commerce Commission issued proceedings against Visa and MasterCard, alleging that interchange fees constitute price fixing and result in a substantial lessening of competition.COMPETITION POLICY AND CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE FEES IN NEW ZEALAND - Dr. Stephen Gale and Ben Gerritsen Shortly before the court case was due to start in Autumn 2009, the suit was settled out of court; the \\"no surcharge rule\\" was prohibited, allowing retailers to pass on the cost of MasterCard and Visa transactions to the customer, and card issuers were allowed to set their own interchange fees, within a maximum limit set by Visa or MasterCard.Commerce Commission and Visa reach agreement to settle credit card interchange fee proceedings - Commerce Commission, 12 August 2009 All issuers of MasterCard cards in New Zealand announced they would be charging the maximum rate.Mastercard New Zealand: Understanding Interchange - retrieved 8 March 2015 The Commission released a report in 2013 reviewing the outcome of the settlement, showing that many merchants were paying higher fees for accepting credit cards than before the settlement.Evaluation of the 2009 interchange and credit card settlements: Research report - Commerce Commission, Date: 19 December 2013 References Category:Merchant services Category:Credit card terminology ","title":"Interchange fee"},{"id":"7674617","text":"Peter Swart (July 5, 1752 ‚Äì November 3, 1829) was a United States Representative from New York.

Canyon was founded in 1951 by Ray and Mary Boley, who had opened the first recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona Recording Productions, in 1948. The Boley's involvement with Native American music began when Ray was asked by the Phoenix Little Theater to record a Navajo singer named Ed Lee Natay. Boley was so taken with what he heard that he recorded a collection of songs titled Natay, Navajo Singer, an album still in active release. To promote the album, the Boleys took a booth at the 1951 Arizona State Fair. For most fairgoers, the recording was only a curiosity, but for Native Americans it was a revelation. They had never seen any of their music available on record before, and the album was well received within the Native community. Before the close of the fair, a Hopi jeweler at a booth next to the Boleys suggested they record Hopi music. The Boleys took the idea to heart and soon began recording music from tribes throughout the southwest. Their new label, Canyon Records, was a sister company to Canyon Films, a company also founded in 1951 specializing in documentaries and commercial work. Prior to the Boleys' efforts, most recordings were produced and released for the benefit of scholars and academics. The Boleys saw their Native American neighbors as customers, tailoring their releases to fit the needs and requests of the Native community. In an era when Native Americans were a little- understood, often ignored, and frequently oppressed minority, Canyon Records served as an important validation of their music, artists, culture, and community. In 1971, the Boleys sold Canyon Films and expanded the efforts of Canyon Records. They opened a retail operation in Phoenix, and began building a distribution network. This development was laborious, and involved extensive travel by motor home across the country. Many store owners didn't see the potential of selling Native American music. One shopkeeper in Bemidji, Minnesota (adjacent to a significant reservation) responded with, \\"Indian music...who wants it?\\" and thus ignoring the potential customers passing his door. Despite this resistance, the Boleys succeeded in building a distribution network throughout the western United States and Canada to sell Canyon titles as well those of other Native American music producers. In 1984, in an attempt to semi-retire, the Boleys sold their store and distribution company (which still operates under the name Drumbeat Indian Arts) to focus solely on production. At this time, Boley made contact with a Native American flutist named R. Carlos Nakai (Boley had known Nakai's father, Raymond Nakai, who played Canyon music on his Navajo language radio program before becoming Navajo tribal chairman). R. Carlos Nakai had produced a recording of solo flute music called Changes, and Boley asked to distribute it. Nakai, who had been turned down by several record labels, agreed. Prior to Changes, most of Canyon's sales were to the Native American community. With the release of Changes Canyon began to place this recording in gift shops, art galleries, and new age oriented retailers. As it became clear that Nakai's music had significant cross-over potential in the gift/tourist and new age markets, Canyon began to build new distribution. The soothing, transporting quality of Nakai's flute music was instantly attractive, and for non-Native listeners, his recordings quickly defined Native American music. Nakai's music would lead the expansion of Native American music into mainstream retailing in the 1990s and Nakai would release more than thirty-five albums and publish a book with Canyon. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the growth of other styles of Native American music such as Pow-wow, peyote song, and contemporary fusions (rock, rap, new age) as the Native American community increased in population and acculturation. The non-Native community began to share greater interest in Native American culture, fueled by major media productions like Dances with Wolves, Geronimo: An American Legend, 500 Nations, and others. In 1992, Boley sold Canyon to his long-time executive assistant, Robert Doyle and retired (Mary died in 1991, Ray would die in 2002). Canyon continued to develop its relationship with Nakai and both traditional and contemporary artists. In 2000, Canyon, needing more warehouse space, purchased its present location and acquired a commercial recording studio (Jack Miller Productions) while adding a website management and graphic design company (Nile Graphics). Canyon has earned the only two gold records for Native American music, both by Nakai, for Canyon Trilogy and Earth Spirit. Additionally, Canyon albums have received twenty-two Grammy nominations with one win for Primeaux & Mike's Bless the People. Canyon has won four INDIE Awards (the Grammy for independent record labels) as well as twenty-five Native American Music Awards (Nammies). Canyon has also developed new forms of Native American music by such artists as Louie Gonnie; Cheevers Toppah, Alex Smith & Kit Landry; Randy Wood; Jay & Tiinesha Begaye among many talented performers. Canyon also continues to work with artists in Pow-Wow music (Black Lodge, Northern Cree, Tha Tribe, Elk Soldier, Warscout) Native Church Music (Verdell Primeaux, Kevin Yazzie, Louie Gonnie, Gerald Primeaux) and chicken scratch (Thee Express, Southern Scratch).

He was the only North Shore City mayor to be elected for three terms and later represented North Shore ward on the Auckland Council between 2010 and 2016. He is now the Deputy Chair of the Devonport- Takapuna Local Board. Early life Wood was born in Birkenhead on Auckland's North Shore. He was educated at Birkdale Primary School, Northcote Intermediate School and Northcote College. Police career Wood originally worked for the New Zealand Police, primarily as a crime investigations manager. As a Police investigator, he worked on many inquiries and served at various times in Auckland, Rotorua and Palmerston North. In his final years of service (1995‚Äì98), he was the manager of Police services within North Shore City. A graduate of the Royal New Zealand Air Force Command and Staff College and the Australian Institute of Police Management Sydney from where he gained a Graduate Certificate in Applied Management. He is the recipient of a New Zealand Police long service and good conduct medal awarded in 1980. Political career = Mayor of North Shore City = In October 1998 Wood was elected Mayor of North Shore City following a fiercely contested election. Wood was able to bring together a new style of council administration with only three standing committees and all councillors members of these committees.Local Governance Statement, 11 November 2008 During his three consecutive terms as mayor (1998‚Äì2007), Wood was most successful in melding the council together and pushed through major reforms in relation to sewerage (waste water) infrastructure improvements, revamping the strategic plan and long term funding programme for North Shore City and developing and building the Northern Busway project.  Chairman of the Auckland Mayoral Forum  Following the 2001 local government elections Wood was elected to the position of chairman of the Auckland Mayoral Forum. In this role Wood pushed through a major joint programme between the Government and Auckland councils for transport funding. This culminated in the Government passing the Local Government Auckland Amendment Act 2004 and the provision of an additional $1.6 billion of transport funding over the following ten years. This extra funding has resulted in huge improvements to the Auckland roading and public transport networks. = Falun Gong = In April 2007, Wood acceded to pressure from Chinese officials not to attend an international cultural show by Divine Performing Arts, which contained scenes depicting the oppression of people who practice the Falun Gong spiritual system. Wood was planning to attend the show with his wife, but after a phone call from the Chinese Consular General's office he backed out, and was quoted as saying: > I don't want to get involved in internal People's Republic of China politics > but I also want to maintain a reasonable relationship with the People's > Republic of China. They said that [the show] was involved in Falun Gong, > they indicated Falun Gong, and I don't know what the true impact of that is, > but it obviously has some concerns for them. > I had indicated that I probably would go to the show, but I'm not going to > cause an international kerfuffle by going to something that I don't know > anything about. I don't know anything about the Falun Gong or whatever it > means. I am a mayor of a city not an international diplomat and I haven't > really got the time to analyse the thing out. =Hiatus from political office= Wood stood for a fourth term as an independent mayoralty candidate in the 2007 North Shore City elections but was defeated by Andrew Williams. In the period since the October 2007 election Wood has worked behind the scenes on a number of projects mainly relating to transport. He is particularly vocal over the need to upgrade or replace the Auckland Harbour Bridge. Wood has also strongly urged the improvement of public transport across the Auckland region whilst at the same time warning about the huge escalation in operational costs. In 2009, in the lead up to the formation of Auckland Council, he questioned whether the new Auckland mayor would be able to control the proposed Auckland Transport Agency under the new proposed model. In the 2008 New Year Honours, Wood was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to local-body affairs. = Involvement in Auckland local government reform = In 2006, Wood indicated his support for the amalgamation of Auckland's seven city councils and boards into one 'supercity' Auckland council. Wood was one of four mayors who asked Prime Minister Helen Clark to reform the Auckland region's local government in September 2006. Subsequently the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance was formed to enquire into the future of local government across the Auckland region. Wood submitted to the Commission with Wyn Hoadley. Their submission was well received by the three commissioners and received a positive report in the NZ Herald. Wood and Hoadley called for one Auckland council across the region with a mayor elected at large, 13 elected and 5 appointed specialist councillors and 13 boroughs to replace the existing councils and community boards. They also recommended that an Environmental Protection Agency be appointed. The high level of debt that the seven territorial councils and the Auckland Regional Council would bring to the new council, along with the negativity by existing councils, was a major concern to Wood. The figure of $3 billion debt that the new Auckland council will need to deal with has been quoted in the media. Wood was concerned as to how the report of the Royal Commissioners on Auckland Governance would be implemented. He believed it should be a report delivered on a broad front and not implemented in a piecemeal manner. =Auckland Council= Wood was a councillor on the Auckland Council from its inception in 2010 until 2016. He joined the Citizens and Ratepayers Association (C&R;) and was elected to the council on the Citizens and Ratepayers‚ÄìNorth Shore ticket to represent the North Shore ward. He topped the poll for this ward in the election. In his inaugural speech to the council, Wood made particular reference to the need to address the recommendations of the Royal Commission report. He made a strong plea to the new council to become actively involved in pursuing improved social conditions and trying to ensure that fewer young people end up in prison. Since the election he has spoken out to ensure that rates for property owners are kept under control. He voiced disappointment in not getting a lead position, especially in the transport area. In his first term (2010‚Äì13), Wood was appointed chairman of the Community Safety Forum, and Deputy Chairman of the Accountability and Performance committee. A major revamp of the graffiti control and removal plan across the Auckland Region was undertaken under the direction of the Community Safety Forum chaired by Wood. The Auckland Council Graffiti Strategy document brought a number of organisations under one umbrella. In mid-2013, Wood abandoned the Citizens and Ratepayers ticket and set up a new ticket named Fair Deal For Shore in order to contest that year's October council elections. He was re-elected as councillor for North Shore ward. Wood is now the chairman of the Auckland Council's Regional Strategy and Policy committee. This is a committee of the whole of council, meaning that it consists of the mayor, 20 councillors and two representative of the Independent Maori Statutory Board. The preparation of the Auckland Plan, a spatial plan for the future development of the Auckland Region over the next 40 years and adopted by Auckland Council in 2012, has been a major interest for Wood. Wood announced in early August 2016 that he would not stand for Auckland Council in the 2016 local elections, but for the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board. He did not stand for re-election to Auckland Council, but was elected to the Devonport-Takapuna local board on the Team George Wood ticket. Wood has been a critic of the Auckland Council's draft Unitary Plan that was adopted in August 2016. Locations such as Milford and Browns Bay have resisted the idea of taller residential buildings than what was proposed in the plan. This was despite plaintive pleas from Mayor Len Brown. Personal life Wood is married to Myra Wood.Mt Albert Presbyterian church, 22 January 1972 m. Myra Grace Keucke He has three adult children and five grandchildren. Wood is a keen supporter of North Harbour sports teams,Birkenhead/Northcote Rugby Club player and supporter since 1957 enjoys spending time with his family and helping community groups. He is also a full-time member of the Takapuna Rotary club, and in the 2009/10 Rotary year was the club's president. His father Oliver Wood operated a trucking business.Beach Haven Transport which amalgamated with G&K; Mills to become Bridge Freighters Ltd (Bridge Freight) Wood senior was a councillor on the Birkenhead Borough Council between 1959 and 1968, serving as the deputy mayor.Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman.

Such claims are wrongful, at least under U.S. and Australian copyright law, because material that is not copyrighted is free for all to use, modify and reproduce. Copyfraud also includes overreaching claims by publishers, museums and others, as where a legitimate copyright owner knowingly, or with constructive knowledge, claims rights beyond what the law allows. The term \\"copyfraud\\" was coined by Jason Mazzone, a Professor of Law at the University of Illinois.\\"Jason Mazzone, Professor, Lynn H. Murray Faculty Scholar in Law\\" , University of Illinois College of Law, accessed June 17, 2015Katyal, Sonia K. and Simone C. Ross. \\"Can technoheritage be owned?\\" , The Boston Globe, May 1, 2016 Because copyfraud carries little or no oversight by authorities and few legal consequences, it exists on a massive scale, with millions of works in the public domain falsely labelled as copyrighted. Payments are therefore unnecessarily made by businesses and individuals for licensing fees. Mazzone states that copyfraud stifles valid reproduction of free material, discourages innovation and undermines free speech rights.Mazzone, Jason. \\"Too Quick to Copyright\\", Legal Times, volume 26, no. 46 Other legal scholars have suggested public and private remedies, and a few cases have been brought involving copyfraud. Definition Mazzone describes copyfraud as: * Claiming copyright ownership of public domain material. * Imposition by a copyright owner of restrictions beyond what the law allows. * Claiming copyright ownership on the basis of ownership of copies or archives. * Attaching copyright notices to a public domain work converted to a different medium. Legal issues =False claims of copyright= According to copyright experts Jason Mazzone and Stephen Fishman, a massive amount of works in the public domain are reprinted and sold by large publishers that state or imply they own copyrights in those works.Fishman, Stephen. The Public Domain, Nolo (2006), pp. 24‚Äì29 While selling copies of public domain works is legal, claiming or implying ownership of a copyright in those works can amount to fraud. Mazzone notes that although the US government protects copyrights, it offers little protection to works in the public domain.Mazzone, Jason. Copyfraud, Stanford Law Books (2011) Consequently, false claims of copyright over public domain works (copyfraud) is common. The profits earned by publishers falsely claiming copyrights have been immense. Section 506(c) of United States Code (U.S.C.) Title 17 prohibits three distinct acts: (1) placing a false notice of copyright on an article; (2) publicly distributing articles which bear a false copyright notice; and (3) importing for public distribution articles which bear a false copyright notice. The prosecution must prove that the act alleged was committed \\"with fraudulent intent\\". Violations of sections 506(c) and 506(d) are each punishable by a fine of up to $2,500. No private right of action exists under either of these provisions.\\"Protection of Copyright Notices ‚Äì 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 506(c) and 506(d)\\", Justice.gov, accessed April 2, 2019 No company has ever been prosecuted for violating this law. Mazzone argues that copyfraud is usually successful because there are few and weak laws criminalizing false statements about copyrights, lax enforcement of such laws, few people who are competent to give legal advice on the copyright status of material, and few people willing to risk a lawsuit to resist the fraudulent licensing fees that resellers demand. =Restricting use with licenses= \\"Migrant mother,\\" by Dorothea Lange Companies that sell public domain material under false claims of copyright often require the buyer to agree to a contract commonly referred to as a license. Many such licenses for material bought online require a buyer to click a button to \\"accept\\" their terms before they can access the material. Book publishers, both hard copy and e-books, sometimes include a license-like statement in compilations of public domain material purporting to restrict how the buyer can use the printed material. For instance, Dover Publications, which publishes collections of public domain clip art, often includes statements purporting to limit how the illustrations can be used. Fishman states that while the seller cannot sue successfully for copyright infringement under federal law, they can sue for breach of contract under the license. Public domain photos by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, available for unrestricted downloads from the Library of Congress, are also available from Getty Images after agreeing to their terms and paying license fees of up to $5,000 for a six-month term.\\"Getty Images will bill you thousands to use a photo that belongs to the public. Is that legal?\\", Los Angeles Times, August 2, 2016 When photographer Carol M. Highsmith sued Getty Images for asserting they owned copyrights to photos she donated to the public domain, Getty admitted that her images were in the public domain, but said it nonetheless had a right to charge a fee for distributing the material, since \\"Distributing and providing access to public domain content is different from asserting copyright ownership of it\\".\\"Photographer sues Getty Images for $1 billion after she's billed for her own photo\\", Los Angeles Times, July 29, 2016 Fishman believes that because US federal law preempts state law when it conflicts with federal law, that such copyright-like licenses should be unenforceable. However, the first two cases dealing with violations of such licenses decided that the licenses were enforceable, despite the fact that the material used was in the public domain: see ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg (1996) and Matthew Bender v. Jurisline (2000).Matthew Bender v. Jurisline, 91 F.Supp.2d 677 (2000) Types of material =Printed works= Collections: A collection of public domain material, whether scanned and digitized, or reprinted, only protects the arrangement of the material, but not the individual works collected.\\"Copyright in Derivative Works and Compilations\\", \\"U.S. Copyright Office Circular 14\\", accessed April 5, 2019 However, publishers of many public domain collections will nonetheless place a copyright notice covering the entire publication. U.S. Government publications: Most of the text, illustrations and photos published by the U.S. government are in the public domain and free from copyright. Some exceptions might include a publication that includes copyrighted material, such as non- government photo. But many publishers include a copyright notice on reproduced government documents, such as one on the Warren Report.Warren Commission Report, Unites States Warren Commission, Barnes & Noble Books copyright notice Knowing that the penalty for making a false copyright claim on a copied government publication is small, some publishers simply ignore the laws. =Digital libraries= Camille Pissarro's The Boulevard Montmartre at Night (1898) Art and photography: Publishers have often placed copyright notices and restrictions on their reproductions of public domain artwork and photos. However, there is no copyright for a reproduction, whether by photograph or even a painted reproduction, since there is no original creativity. One famous court case which explained that was Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp. in 1999: The \\"skill, labor or judgment merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality . . . .\\"\\"BRIDGEMAN ART LIBRARY, LTD. v. COREL CORP., 36 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)\\", Cornell Law School Despite the clear ruling of a U.S. federal court, however, Mazzone notes that the Bridgeman Art Library has been \\"undeterred by its loss in court and continues to assert copyright in reproductions\\" of countless public domain works by famous artists of previous centuries, such as Camille Pissarro.Pissarro's \\"The Boulevard Montmartre at Night,\\" 1897 Mazzone also uses the example of Corbis, founded by Bill Gates, which was merged with Getty Images, a similar stock photo company. Getty has over 200 million items for sale, most of which have been scanned and digitized to be sold and distributed online. Its vast collection includes many images of two-dimensional public domain works. Other digital libraries, including ARTstor and Art Resource, have claimed copyright over images they supply and imposed restrictions on how the images can be used. =Original artworks, manuscripts and archives= Besides online digital libraries, a number of libraries, archives and museums which hold original manuscripts, photos and fine art, have claimed to have a copyright over copies they make of those items because they possess the original. However, many of those items were created before the 20th century and have become part of the public domain. One example that Mazzone gives is that of the American Antiquarian Society, which has a large archive of early American documents. Its terms and conditions for obtaining a copy of any of those documents requires agreeing to their license, along with payment.American Antiquarian Society license Another repository, the New York State Historical Association's Fenimore Art Museum in New York, similarly requires that a user of its archive first agree to their terms before visiting or reproducing anything from its collection of nineteenth and early twentieth century photographs, most of which have long become part of the public domain.Fenimore Art Museum terms and conditions Reproductions of public domain works by artists such as van Gogh are often printed by museums with a questionable copyright notice. According to Mazzone, archives and museums typically assert ownership of copyrights where none exists, and wrongly require a user agree to their license and terms and conditions. Former president of the Society of American Archivists, Peter Hirtle, has written that \\"many repositories would like to maintain a kind of quasi-copyright-like control over the further use of materials in their holding, comparable to the monopoly granted to a copyright owner.\\"Hirtle Peter.\\"Archives or Assets?\\", The American Archivist: Fall/Winter 2003, Vol. 66, No. 2, pp. 235-247 Mazzone, for one, finds the trend of false claims of copyright by public, taxpayer supported institutions, especially troubling: \\"We should be able to expect in return that public domain works be left in the public domain.\\" Although he credits the Library of Congress among the shrinking list of archives that properly states whether a work is copyrighted. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for example, includes in its vast collection of artworks many from the nineteenth century. Although they have become part of the public domain, the museum claims they own the copyrights to them and therefore requires a visitor to agree to its terms before obtaining a copy of any works, i.e.: \\"The Images are not simple reproductions of the works depicted and are protected by copyright... The MFA regularly makes images available for reproduction and publication in, for example, research papers and textbooks ...\\"MFA-Boston Terms and Conditions In the United Kingdom, it remains standard practice for museums and repositories to claim rights over images of material in their collections, and to charge reproduction fees. In November 2017, 27 prominent art historians, museum curators and critics wrote to The Times newspaper, to urge that \\"fees charged by the UK's national museums to reproduce images of historic paintings, prints and drawings are unjustified, and should be abolished\\". They commented that \\"[m]useums claim they create a new copyright when making a faithful reproduction of a 2D artwork by photography or scanning, but it is doubtful that the law supports this\\". They argued that the fees inhibit the dissemination of knowledge, the very purpose of public museums and galleries, and so \\"pose a serious threat to art history\\". Therefore, they advised the UK's national museums \\"to follow the example of a growing number of international museums (such as the Netherlands' Rijksmuseum) and provide open access to images of publicly owned, out-of-copyright paintings, prints and drawings so that they are free for the public to reproduce\\". =Public domain films= The owners of the actual physical copies of public domain footage often impose restrictions on its use along with charging licensing fees. The result is that documentary filmmakers have in many cases found it nearly impossible to either make a film or else have dropped projects entirely. In one example, filmmaker Gordon Quinn of Kartemquin Films in Chicago learned that the public domain federal government footage he wanted to use in a film was considered copyrighted by a director who then wanted payment to use it. Similarly, Stanford professor Jan Krawitz needed to incorporate a public domain clip into an instructional film, but the archive who had the film made no distinction between copyrighted works and public domain works, thereby requiring her to pay a substantial fee. According to Matt Dunne, who wrote about this problem in a popular filmmaking trade journal, filmmakers are now \\"abandoning projects because of cost or self- censoring materials...the sense in the independent filmmaker community is that the problem [of clearance authorization] has reached a crisis point.\\"Dunne, Matt. \\"The Cost of Clearance\\", The Independent, April 2005 pp. 30-31 As a result, MovieMaker magazine, another trade journal, suggests that producers should \\"never assume that any film clip is in the public domain.\\"\\"How to Avoid a Lawsuit in Waiting\\", MovieMaker, Feb. 11, 2003 Mazzone describes this new \\"licensing culture\\" as becoming an entrenched norm built on fear of using any prior work without permission. These clearance fees are typically a major portion of a film's budget, which leads more producers to simply cut any footage out of a film rather than deal with obtaining permissions. The industry motto, according to entertainment attorney Fernando Ramirez, is \\"When in doubt, cut it out.\\"\\"The Many Meanings of ‚ÄúFair Use\\", Independent magazine, Dec. 1, 2005 Analysis Mazzone places blame on both violators and the government: He also adds that \\"[C]opyfraud upsets the constitutional balance and undermines First Amendment values\\", chilling free expression and stifling creativity. Relevant laws Modern editions of public domain books hundreds of years old, such as Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776), are often sold under a claim of copyright by the new publisher. In the U.S. Copyright Act, only two sections deal with improper assertions of copyright on public domain materials: Section 506(c) criminalizes fraudulent uses of copyright notices, and Section 506(e) punishes knowingly making a false representation of a material fact in the application for copyright registration. Section 512(f) additionally punishes using the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove material the issuer knows is not infringing. But the U.S. Copyright Act does not expressly provide for any civil actions to remedy illegal copyright claims over public domain materials, nor does the Act prescribe relief for individuals who have been damaged: either by refraining from copying or by paying for a license to use public domain material. Professor Peter Suber has argued that the U.S. government should \\"make the penalties for copyfraud (false claim of copyright) at least as severe as the penalties for infringement; that is, take the wrongful decrease in the circulation of ideas at least as seriously as the wrongful increase in the circulation of ideas.\\"Suber, Peter. \\"Open Access and Copyright\\", SPARC Open Access Newsletter, July 2, 2011, accessed July 17, 2016 In Australia, section 202 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968, imposes penalties for \\"groundless threats of legal proceedings\\" and provides a cause of action for any false claims of copyright infringement. This includes false claims of copyright ownership of public domain material, or claims to impose copyright restrictions beyond those permitted by the law. American legal scholar Paul J. Heald wrote that payment demands for spurious copyright infringement might be resisted in civil lawsuits under a number of commerce- law theories: (1) Breach of warranty of title; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud; and (4) false advertising.Heald, Paul J. \\"Payment Demands for Spurious Copyrights: Four Causes of Action\\" , Journal of Intellectual Property Law, vol. 1, 1993‚Äì1994, p. 259 Heald cited a case in which the first of these theories was used successfully in a copyright context: Tams-Witmark Music Library v. New Opera Company. Cory Doctorow, in a 2014 Boing Boing article, noted the \\"widespread practice of putting restrictions on scanned copies of public domain books online\\" and the many \\"powerful entities who lobby online services for a shoot now/ask questions later approach to copyright takedowns, while the victims of the fraud have no powerful voice advocating for them.\\"Doctorow, Cory. \\"Copyfraud, uncertainty and doubt: the vanishing online public domain\\", Boing Boing, June 25, 2014, accessed June 16, 2015. See also Coleman, Ron. \\"Who owns the copyright in scans of public domain works?\\", Likelihood of Confusion, September 19, 2012, accessed October 30, 2018 Professor Tanya Asim Cooper wrote that Corbis's claims to copyright in its digital reproductions of public domain art images are \\"spurious ... abuses ... restricting access to art that belongs to the public by requiring payment of unnecessary fees and stifling the proliferation of new, creative expression, of 'Progress' that the Constitution guarantees.Cooper, Tanya Asim. \\"Corbis & Copyright?: Is Bill Gates Trying to Corner the Market on Public Domain Art?\\" , Intellectual Property Law Bulletin, vol. 16, p. 1, University of Alabama 2011 Charles Eicher pointed out the prevalence of copyfraud with respect to Google Books, Creative Commons' efforts to \\"license\\" public domain works, and other areas. He explained one of the methods: After you scan a public domain book, \\"reformat it as a PDF, mark it with a copyright date, register it as a new book with an ISBN, then submit it to Amazon.com for sale [or] as an ebook on Kindle. Once the book is listed for sale ... submit it to Google Books for inclusion in its index. Google earns a small kickback on every sale referred to Amazon or other booksellers.\\"Eicher, Charles. \\"Copyfraud: Poisoning the public domain\\" , The Register, June 26, 2009, accessed June 16, 2015 This image from The White House's flickr account is in the public domain because it is a US federal government work. Yet, it bears a claim that the \\"photograph may not be manipulated in any way\\".Photo at the White House , The White House flickr account, posted December 6, 2009.

Techdirt wrote of another White House photo, \\"the White House is ignoring what that license says in claiming that the photograph 'may not be manipulated in any way.'

In 1582 he was named judge in Bordeaux, and in 1608 King Henry IV commanded him to put an end to the practice of witchcraft in Labourd, in the French part of the Basque Country, where over four months he sentenced to death several dozen persons.Jonathan L. Pearl, 'French Catholic Demonologists and Their Enemies in the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries,' Church History, Vol. 52, No. 4, 1983, p. 461. He wrote three books on witchcraft, analysing the Sabbath, lycanthropy, and sexual relationships during the Sabbath. In his opinion, Satan had little sexual intercourse with single women, because he preferred married women for that implied also adultery, and the incest between mothers and sons at the end of the Sabbath was essential to give birth to demonic children, as well as a sexual act between a witch and a he-goat (believed to be Satan present at the reunion). He also thought that Satan was pleased with a clean body but not a clean (or pure) soul, inducing people to wash their bodies and embellish themselves with ornaments. Views His grandfather, Bernard de Rostegui (cf. Basque surname Aroztegi, 'home of the smith'), a native of Lower Navarre, had changed his Basque surname for the French one of de Lancre upon migrating to Bordeaux. This familial denial seems to have influenced him into a deep hate against everything Basque. He considered Basques to be ignorant, superstitious, proud and irreligious. Basque women were in his eyes libertines and Basque priests were for him just womanizers with no religious zeal. He believed that the root of the natural Basque tendency towards evil was love of dance. All these prejudices are reflected in his work Tableau de l'Inconstance des Mauvais Anges et Demons, published in 1612, not long after the process. Quoting from the Tableau at length, P.G. Maxwell-Stuart clarifies De Lancre's legal orientation on the evidence of witchcraft in Labourd: > The confessions of male and female witches are in agreement with indicia so > strong that one can maintain they are genuine, real, and neither deceptive > nor illusory. This relieves judges of any misgiving they may have. For when > they confess to infanticide, parents find their children have been > suffocated or their blood completely sucked out of them. When they confess > to digging up corpses and violating the sacred nature of graves, one > discovers that bodies have been torn from their graves and are no longer > found where they had been put. When they confess they have given a piece of > their clothing to Satan as a pledge, one finds this tell-tale scrap upon > their person. When they say they have cast evil on such and such a person or > animal, (and sometimes they confess they have cured them), it is self- > evident they have been subject to malefice, they have been wounded, or they > have been cured. Consequently, this is not an illusion. Here is the first > rule which makes us see clearly what the witch has done, either through her > confession strengthened by compelling indicia and very great, very strong > presumptions, or by irreproachable witnesses. (Tableau Book 6, discourse 5, > section 5, in Maxwell-Stuart's Witch Hunters: Professional Prickers, > Unwitchers and Witch Finders of the Renaissance, 2003, 1st ed., p. 33) In 1622, he published a second book: L'incredulit√© et mescreance du sortil√®ge, that is an extension of his first one. Thanks to these books we know something of what happened in the process that de Lancre directed against the people of Labourd, because the judicial records vanished during the French Revolution. P.G. Maxwell-Stuart writes on De Lancre in his Witch Hunters that: > ...L'incredulit√© et mescreance du sortil√®ge plainement convaicue (1622), > produced twelve years after his long personal engagement with witches and > witchcraft, spends an impressive amount of learning upon showing that magic > of any kind is not an illusion and should not be dismissed by those who are > pleased to think otherwise. This work aroused the ire of Gabriel Naud√©, at > one time physician to Louis XIII and later librarian to Cardinal Barberini, > who in 1625 published a fierce response, Apologie pour tous les grands > personages qui ont est√© faussement soup√ßonn√©s de magie, to which De Lancre, > duly irritated, replied two years later with his final work, Du sortil√®ge. > (p. 38) On reconsidering de Lancre and his works, Professor Jonathan Pearl says the following in his Crime of Crimes: Demonology and Politics in France 1560‚Äì1620: > As already indicated, many historians have described de Lancre as a > ridiculous obsessed fanatic. Terms like \\"gleeful,\\" \\"gloating,\\" \\"infantile,\\" > \\"sadistic\\" and \\"bigoted\\" have all been applied to him. But in his writing, > de Lancre constantly emphasized the distastefulness of the task in which he > was engaged. Certainly, he believed totally the testimony that he heard, > sentenced people to death based on that testimony, and worked to convince > his colleagues to follow his lead. But there is little evidence in his work > to support the picture that has so often been drawn. (p. 142-143) And that: > It would also be a mistake [...] to dismiss de Lancre as a crank, a bizarre > or ridiculous figure. He was an earnest advocate of a worldview that was not > insignificant in his time. He took seriously his instruction from > respectable orthodox scholars, and did not waver from them for his long > life. (p. 147) The Labourd witch-hunt of 1609 The process began with a dispute between the Lord of Urtubi and some people who had accused him and his men of being witches. This dispute evolved in sporadic fight and soon the authorities of Donibane-Lohizune asked for the intervention of the Judge of Bourdeaux, who happened to be de Lancre. In less than a year some 70 people were burnt at the stake, among them several priests. De Lancre wasn't satisfied: he estimated that some 3,000 witches were still at large (10% of the population of Labourd in that time). But the Parlement of Bordeaux eventually dismissed him from office. In his Portrait of the Inconstancy of Witches, de Lancre sums up his rationale as follows: > To dance indecently; eat excessively; make love diabolically; commit > atrocious acts of sodomy; blaspheme scandalously; avenge themselves > insidiously; run after all horrible, dirty, and crudely unnatural desires; > keep toads, vipers, lizards, and all sorts of poison as precious things; > love passionately a stinking goat; caress him lovingly; associate with and > mate with him in a disgusting and scabrous fashion‚Äîare these not the > uncontrolled characteristics of an unparalleled lightness of being and of an > execrable inconstancy that can be expiated only through the divine fire that > justice placed in Hell? from the Foreword of the Tableau, page 5 in the Scholz Williams translation Works *Tableau de l'inconstance des mauvais anges et d√©mons.

The town itself is small but services a considerable agricultural region in the eastern Shire of Dumbleyung. At the 2016 census, Kukerin and its surrounding areas had a population of 166.  History According to an official source, Kukerin's name is of Aboriginal origin, was first recorded as the name of a local soak and gully in 1908 and has also been spelled \\"Cookerin\\", but the precise meaning is not known. However, in local languages, words such as karkar mean \\"east\\", and the townsite is near the eastern edge of country traditionally owned by the Wiilman people.Nicholas Thieberger 1996, \\"4.2.9 Wiilman\\", Handbook of Western Australian Aboriginal Languages, South of the Kimberley (2 February 2015).[South Australian Museum, 2014, \\"Wudjari (WA)\\", Tindale Tribes (2 February 2015). There is no evidence for a popular theory that the area was named after sandalwood cutters named \\"Cooke\\" and \\"Ring\\". Until 1912, the area was known as Merilup (a name that now refers to an area to the south). In the 1870s, John Holland took up a pastoral lease of in the area and established a sandalwood depot. Sandalwood cutters opened up much of the surrounding area, and in 1904 the Rabbit-Proof Fence was built near the town. In 1912, the town was gazetted when it became the terminus of an extension of the Wagin to Dumbleyung train line in 1912. The primary school and hall were built in 1914, and Kukerin Hotel began trading in 1928--all are still open to this day. Present day Kukerin is largely an agricultural town, with wheat and sheep farming being the main occupations. The town contains a secondary receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling and one of the state's three Bunge grain depots west of the main town. It functions as a service town for the surrounding agricultural area, and contains a general store, primary school, hotel, newsagency/post office, and the Nenke Park sports fields. The TrachMach Fair used to be held with various vintage and modern vehicles on display. In recent years this has transformed into the Kukerin Creekbed and Burnout Competition, which is held during the Queen's Birthday long weekend and is hosted at Nenke Park.

It continued as an independent company until November 1958, when it merged with Rothmans of Pall Mall. In 1972 the name was used as the vehicle for the merger of various European tobacco interests to form Rothmans International.  History  =19th century= The antecedents of the Carreras business stem back into the eighteenth century (their products and advertising materials consistently bore the legend 'Established 1788'), and forebears of the founder‚Äôs family were Spanish apothecaries. The founder of the business was a Spanish nobleman, Don Jos√© Carreras Ferrer, who fought in the Peninsular War under the Duke of Wellington (1808‚Äì1814). After serving with distinction and receiving the highest military honours, it is believed he was obliged to leave Spain on account of his political views. During the early years of the 19th century Carreras began trading in London at a time when cigars were increasing in popularity and Don Jos√© became a pioneer in his field. However, although the business prospered it did not become a major concern until his son, Don Jos√© Joaquin, began to specialise in the blending of tobaccos and snuff. By 1852 Don Jos√© Joaquin Carreras had established himself near Leicester Square at 61 Prince's Street W1, and in 1853 was granted a warrant as the sole supplier of cigars and tobacco to the Spanish Legation in London. His fame as a tobacco blender soon spread, and he produced blends to suit the individual tastes of the highest members of society, with customers visiting his showrooms to select their own tobaccos. One of Don Jos√©'s most famous customers was the third Earl of Craven. A special blend, to become known as Craven Mixture, was created specially for him and this blend has since spread in popularity throughout the world. Some of Don Jos√©'s tobacco brands became world famous, including Guards' Mixture and Hankey's Mixture. Over one thousand brands of cigar could be bought from Carreras, together with snuffs, cigarettes, pipes and all the usual requisites of the trade. In 1860 Carreras became the founder committee member of the Tobacco Trade Benevolent Association, and soon opened another shop, this time in the Arcade in London's newly developed and fashionable Regent Street W1. The business remained in the hands of the Carreras family until 1894, when Mr W J Yapp, a well-known figure in the shoe leather industry, took control. Prince's Street became part of Wardour Street in 1878, and Number 61 became known as Prince's House, No 7 Wardour Street. The House of Carreras became a London landmark, and it was here that Prince Edward (later Edward VII) often came to select the finest cigars. =Early 20th century= In 1881, the first cigarette making machine was patented in the United States by James Bonsack and by 1883 one of the British manufacturers, W. D. & H. O. Wills, had pioneered the use of the Bonsack in England. Wills joined with twelve other companies to form the Imperial Tobacco Group, from which both Rothmans and Carreras chose to remain independent, and by 1901 the Bonsack machine, making 200 cigarettes a minute, was exclusively available only to members of this Group. However, another of the cigarette machine makers, Bernhard Baron, had returned to London from the United States in 1896 with a patent for a new machine which could make 450 cigarettes a minute, and his progress was watched with interest by Mr Yapp who was by then running the Carreras business but who was keen to make cigarettes a paying venture. Having been deprived of the opportunity to sell his machines to the newly formed Imperial Tobacco Company, which had a monopoly on the Bonsack machines, Yapp was able to negotiate a business arrangement with Baron in 1903. On 6 June 1903, Carreras became a public company with Yapp and Baron as directors and, under the leadership of Bernhard Baron, heralded the beginnings of defiant competition for the now powerful Imperial Tobacco Group and the new American invader, James Buchanan Duke, who was also capturing large slices of the British market with Ogden‚Äôs Guinea Gold, the first Virginia cigarette made in this country. The original Carreras prospectus was heavily criticised in the City press, but within a short time the shares were fully subscribed, particularly by members of the tobacco trade who were quick to realise the potential of the new venture. The Baron family had a reputation as good employers who treated their staff well. Bernhard Baron would walk amongst his employees daily, enquiring after their families, and his son, Louis, and his grandson, Maurice, also made regular visits to the factory floor. A tradition developed that on Bernhard's birthday, each December, all employees were given two weeks' wages and a cake to take home. In 1904, an allied company was established. Called Carreras and Marcianus Ltd and operating from St James's Place, Aldgate EC3, the former Baron Machine Company works, the company‚Äôs purpose was to commence production of machine made cigarettes. During the last six months of 1904 three brands made their debut, including Black Cat, the first cigarette in the United Kingdom to contain coupons which were redeemable for gifts. In 1905 yet more brands were introduced such as Chick, Jetty and Sweet Kiss and Carreras began coupon trading in Black Cat. Business prospered and in 1906 additional premises were opened nearby, introducing new brands such as Carreras Ovals and Seven Up. Baron chose many novel schemes for the promotion of Carreras‚Äô pipe tobacco and cigarette brands. In 1909, the company introduced the Baron automatic pipe filler in cartridges, which revolutionised pipe smoking and sold by the million. In 1907 Carreras introduced an early version of the football pools. Coupons listing forthcoming matches were available from tobacconists and prizes were given for both the best forecast and to the owner of the shop from where the coupon had been purchased. Expansion of the business continued and, in 1907, the first Arcadia Works was built on City Road EC1. More developments were made in the pipe field, including a cartridge case. Other brands were introduced before the First World War including Fireball, Golden Clipper, Red Route Mixture and Life Ray. In 1913, Carreras acquired the prestige business of Alexander Boguslavsky and opened a showroom at 55 Piccadilly W1 which still retained many of its grand, privately occupied houses and clubs. The medallion which is still reproduced on each packet of Piccadilly Filter was acquired with the purchase of Boguslavsky's company. The 1914-18 war caused a rapid acceleration in cigarette smoking and Carreras was to the fore in supplying cigarettes to the armed forces. Cigarettes were in short supply but Baron did not deviate from his object of better quality marketing of better quality products than his competitors. As an example, he enclosed French dictionaries in the containers of all cigarettes sent to the Front and supplied millions of copies of phrase and grammar books. The Arcadia works at Mornington Crescent In 1921, immediately after the launch of Craven A, Carreras launched yet more brands such as Wall Arms, Piccadilly and Turf. By 1927 the business had outgrown the Arcadia premises in City Road, the war had increased demand for cigarettes and, despite taking on additional London premises at Aldgate, Carreras had to find a new factory. In 1928, the famous Arcadia Works was opened in Mornington Crescent NW1, formerly a favourite residence of artists and writers. This building, which has become a major London landmark, was as revolutionary in its concept as it was unusual in its design. It was the first factory in Britain to make use of pre-stressed concrete technology, the first to contain air conditioning and a dust extraction plant and the company was the first to provide full welfare services for its employees. Such was the fame of the Arcadia Works that it was often visited by royalty, including the Duke of Windsor when he was the Prince of Wales, King George VI when he was the Duke of York, and the late Duke of Kent. Many other important visitors from every part of the globe were entertained at Mornington Crescent. Dominating the entrance to the building were two large bronze cats. Cast at the Haskins Foundry in London, these versions of the Egyptian god Bastet were each eight feet six inches tall and stood guard over Arcadia Works until 1959 when Carreras merged with Rothmans of Pall Mall and moved to a new factory in Basildon, Essex. The cats were separated, with one making the short journey to Essex, but one went to bask in the sun outside the Carreras factory at Spanishtown, Jamaica. Between the two World Wars, Carreras' sales in the United Kingdom and overseas increased and more brands were launched. In 1929 valuable trade-marks were acquired with the purchase of John Sinclair Ltd of Newcastle upon Tyne (including Barneys Tobacco, Barneys Punchbowle and Parson's Pleasure). Soon after the purchase of Sinclairs the grandson of the founder of the firm, John Alexander Sinclair, was elected to the Board of Carreras and later became Joint Managing Director. =Post World War II= Once again a World War brought a sharp increase in the nation‚Äôs demand for cigarettes, coinciding with an inevitable scarcity of tobacco leaf. This brought about a shortage of both Carreras and its competitors' products, a situation which was not alleviated until the early 1950s. In 1953, Carreras acquired the assets of R & J Hill Limited of London and the entire share capital of Murray, Sons & Company Limited of Belfast who were manufacturing a fine range of popular pipe tobaccos, including Erinmore Mixture and Erinmore Flake. By now Alfred Dunhill Ltd, the tobacconists which had been established in 1907 at No 30 Duke Street SW1, was a subsidiary of the Carreras Group. Carreras also had an associate in Jamaica and an interest in P J Carroll, Ireland‚Äôs largest cigarette manufacturer. The Dutch cigar company, Schimmelpenninck, was also part of the Group. The Baron family, which had held a controlling interest in Carreras since the early 1900s, decided to sell their shares in 1958 but, before doing so, were responsible for two major projects which became decisive in the progress of the Company. Firstly it was decided to transfer the manufacturing plant to the new town of Basildon in Essex as the Arcadia Works in Mornington Crescent had become uneconomic and mass production techniques were being carried out on different floor levels. Secondly, with the beginning of the swing towards filtered cigarette smoking, Carreras launched a brand which came to have national appeal - Guards. In November 1958, with the sale of the Baron family shares, Carreras merged with Rothmans of Pall Mall which by now had markets in some 120 countries around the world. Two factors played an important part in bringing together Rothmans and Carreras. The first was the trend towards filter cigarettes which was beginning in the 1950s. Both Rothmans and Carreras had pioneered filtered brands. The second was Carreras‚Äô decision to move manufacturing to the large, modern factory in Basildon which could provide much-needed production capacity for Rothmans with its expanding international trade. A manufacturing agreement was entered into and by 1961 the business had expanded to the point where Carreras had acquired the Rothmans cigarette and tobacco business in Britain and some of its overseas markets. As a result of this deal, the biggest shareholder in the enlarged operation became Rothmans Tobacco (Holdings). As the business expanded so new trading links were forged and new businesses opened up. Carreras Rothmans Ltd was formed in 1972, when Carreras Limited was used as the vehicle for the merger of various European tobacco interests to form Rothmans International. Famous customers Carreras's Regent Street store was visited by royalty from many lands and as early as 1866 he received Royal Warrants from the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Shortly after in 1874, Carreras received a Warrant from King Alfonso XII of Spain. The hand-written sales ledgers of this period show accounts held by nobility, statesmen, men of letters and high-ranking service officers. J. M. Barrie, the famous novelist and author, was a valued customer during the 1890s. When he wrote My Lady Nicotine which was published in 1890, he referred to a mythical tobacco called Arcadia Mixture. It was not long before Carreras realised that Barrie's sole supply of tobacco was the Craven Mixture he sold at Wardour Street, and in January 1897 Barrie confirmed to Don Jose that Arcadia Mixture and Craven Mixture were one and the same. Shortly afterwards, Carreras began using Barrie's endorsement in his advertising and Craven Mixture benefited as sales at home and abroad increased rapidly. Products = Craven A = Soon after the end of the 1914-18 War the market resumed its normal competitive spirit with Carreras once more well to the fore. Baron knew that in order to compete successfully his product had to be better than his competitors' and in 1921 the House of Carreras recorded a first in the industry by launching a brand destined to become a household name in over 120 countries worldwide with the now famous slogan \\"Will Not Affect Your Throat.\\" This was the first ever machine-made cork-tipped cigarette, selling under the brand name of Craven A, again using the name of the Earl of Craven whose family remain close friends of the Rothmans International Group of companies. Craven A became such a huge success in the United Kingdom that various cork- tipped brands were launched to compete against it by Imperial Tobacco Company and other tobacco houses. But the competition fell by the wayside and Craven A is still marketed around the world. At the same time as Craven A was pioneering a new fashion in cigarette smoking, the competition was moving in on the coupon business. But once again, Carreras stayed in front with their well-known coupon brand Black Cat. = Black Cat = Black Cat is now a cigarette brand sold around the world, but its name sprang from humble origins. The original black cat was an ordinary domestic cat which spent hours curled up asleep in the window of Don Jos√©‚Äôs Wardour Street shop, well before the turn of the 20th century. Because the cat became such a familiar sight to the passers-by, the shop began to be known as the ‚Äúblack cat shop‚Äù. Don Jos√© decided to adopt the cat as part of the company's image and in 1886 it became the first trademark to be registered by Carreras. Eventually the cat became an integral part of the design of the Black Cat pack where it appeared in a white circle surrounded by a black border above the initials ‚ÄúJJC‚Äù (Don Jos√© Joaquin Carreras). The Black Cat cigarette was introduced in 1904 as one of the first machine-made cigarettes manufactured in Britain. The cat was used in some of the earliest cigarette promotions, including the Black Cat stamp album which was issued free to smokers. Stamps were available inside the cigarette packs and ¬£325 in prizes was offered for the best completed albums. The first item to be given away inside Black Cat cigarette packets was the Black Cat Library of Short Stories which appeared in 1909. This was a series of forty adventure stories with titles ranging from ‚ÄúA Fight with the Spaniards‚Äù, to ‚ÄúThe Gunpowder Plot‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho Was the Man in the Iron Mask?‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Revenge‚Äù. In 1910 Black Cat began full-scale coupon trading, offering gifts such as pipe fillers and other smokers' requisites. One of the most ambitious promotions took place on 18 October 1913 - designated by the company as ‚ÄúBlack Cat Day‚Äù. Advertised extensively in the national press, Black Cat salesmen could give a golden half-sovereign to anyone they approached in the street who could prove they were in possession of a Black Cat pack. During the First World War Carreras sent gift parcels to the British troops which included French phrase books inside cigarette packs. These were to enable the soldiers to ‚Äúget on better terms with our French allies‚Äù. In 1914 Black Cat cigarettes offered smokers a chance to collect small cardboard flags of the Allies and in 1916 the first set of cigarette cards was included in the packs. This was a set of 140 war cartoons by Louis Raemaekers which could fetch a considerable price at auction today. The next series of cards quickly followed, featuring Women on War Work. This was succeeded in 1915 by a series on the Science of Boxing. During the early 1920s enthusiasm for the Black Cat was at a peak, with many people wearing badges and stickers featuring the cat and even going to fancy dress parties in black cat costumes. By now, coupon trading was fiercely competitive and the Black Cat gift catalogue offered gramophone records, gardening equipment, gentlemen's razors, automobile accessories and wirelesses. The cigarette manufacturers agreed to withdraw coupons on 1 January 1934 but the number and variety of cigarette card series continued to increase, with Carreras amongst the most prolific of the issuing companies. During the Second World War many cigarette brands were withdrawn from sale and Black Cat was one of these. The brand didn‚Äôt appear again until 1957, but it was reintroduced as a plain cigarette at a time when huge sales were being made by filter cigarettes. The market for plain brands continued to diminish and Black Cat was withdrawn again in 1959. It made another appearance on the UK market in 1976, this time as a filter cigarette, but finally disappeared in November 1993. However, the trademark continues in the ownership of the British American Tobacco Group of companies. = Coupons = In 1931, with the coupon war at its height, Carreras made a move which not only registered yet another first for the industry but also rocketed its sales at the expense of its competitors. Coupons were introduced to small cigarettes and sold under the brand name Clubs. An outstanding piece of marketing, this was a departure from the usual wide range of gifts, offering in their place a limited range of carefully selected, high quality articles covering more personal day-to-day requirements. The brand was very successful. At one time there were no fewer than 14 factories devoted entirely to the production of clothing to be given in return for coupons for Clubs cigarettes. Sales increased rapidly and again the competition swung into action with at least six other brands of a similar type. Clubs' success even persuaded Gallaher Tobacco to introduce coupons into Park Drive, a move which all through the coupon war they had steadfastly maintained they would never do. Finally the coupon war careered out of control. Competition was cut-throat. Eventually the companies agreed to end the war in 1933 with the formation of the Tobacco Trade Association, now the UK Tobacco Manufacturers' Association. To increase sales of this once prestigious brand of cigarettes and offer a cheaper price, there was the introduction of the Flip top 20 pack a design submitted by Frederick Willis. Although the package was used by the company no patent was issued for the design and therefore no residuals paid for its ingenious design and use. Today most brands of cigarettes can be purchased in these 20 Flip Top packages.

The word tomography is used to link the field, in concept, to other processes that infer the internal characteristics of an object from external observation, as is done in magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography (even though the term tomography strictly refers to imaging by slicing). The field is a recent development in electrical engineering and computer science, founded in 1996. Network tomography advocates that it is possible to map the path data takes through the Internet by examining information from \\"edge nodes,\\" the computers in which the data are originated and from which they are requested. The field is useful for engineers attempting to develop more efficient computer networks. Data derived from network tomography studies can be used to increase quality of service by limiting link packet loss and increasing routing optimization. Recent developments There have been many published papers and tools in the area of network tomography, which aim to monitor the health of various links in a network in real-time. These can be classified into loss and delay tomography. A summary can be found in and. =Loss tomography= Loss tomography aims to find \\"lossy\\" links in a network by sending active \\"probes\\" from various vantage points in the network or the Internet. Published work in this area (not exhaustive) includes, and. =Delay tomography= The area of delay tomography has also attracted attention in the recent past. It aims to find link delays using end-to-end probes sent from vantage points. This can potentially help isolate links with large queueing delays caused by congestion. Related papers include one by Tsang et al. More applications The area of network tomography also includes that of inferring network topology using end-to-end probes. Topology discovery is a tradeoff between accuracy vs overhead. In network tomography, the emphasis is to achieve as accurate a picture of the network with minimal overhead. In comparison, other network topology discovery techniques using SNMP or Route analytics aim for greater accuracy with less emphasis on overhead reduction. Other example applications of network tomography include finding links which are shared by multiple paths (and can thus become potential bottlenecks in the future). It has also been suggested that Network Tomography can improve the control of the smart grid See also *Network science *Computer network References Category:Networks Category:Electrical engineering ","title":"Network tomography"},{"id":"7674822","text":"Asayama Ichiden-ry≈´ (ÊµÖÂ±±‰∏Ä‰ºùÊµÅ) is a Japanese kory≈´ martial art founded in the late Muromachi period by Asayama Ichidensai Shigetatsu (ÊµÖÂ±±‰∏Ä‰ºùÊñéÈáçÊô®). Asayama Ichidensai Shigetatsu There are often conflicting stories among Martial art schools that have many branches about who actually founded the school and how. In some cases this stems from Japanese Samurai being fond of changing their names. Asayama Ichiden Ryu Taijutsu is one of those schools. The founder went by many names and there are many different and conflicting stories about the founder and school. Several website discuss the same figure but with a different given names. History Asayama Ichiden Ryu Taijutsu was founded by Asayama Mitsugoro Ichidensai in 1566. He was the third son of a military expert (gunshi) who was named Asayama Genban Minamoto no Yoshitada Ichiyosai. His father was in the employ of Akai Aku Uemon Kageto, who was the Lord of the Amada and Hikami Districts. The story goes that at the age of 12, Ichidensai had a dream with Fudo Myo Oh, which resulted in enlightenment for him and the subsequent founding of Asayama Ichiden Ryu. This is not the only story other traditions state that the Ichiden Ryu lineage begins with Marume Mondonosh√¥ Norikichi,a student of his Kuniie Yauemon, instructed Asayama Ichidensai Shigetatsu. Ichidensai then spread his tradition across the country. Another tradition claims that he learned from a variety of teachers, including Kamiizumi Hidetsuna, Okuyama Saemondayu Tadanobu, Nakamura Senjur√¥, and the Yoshioka family in the capital there also may be a connection with Tamiya Ryu. Ichidensai died on the 5th day of the first month of the 4th year of J√¥ky√¥ (1687) at the age of 78. He had numerous students, and many schools spawned off of the main branch. The school Asayama Ichiden-ryu was founded by Asayama Ichidensai Shigetatsu as solely an atemi (striking) and (reversal) art, aside from jujutsu, the art also contains gyakute-jutsu, a rare reversal art utilizing a short wooden pole 37 cm or 25 cm in length. The art is learned first bare-handed, but its techniques may also be used with a steel fan. There are many different branches in different parts of Japan and in the United States, each with their own characteristics. The art was initially taught in the Aizu domain, which is the same area that Daito Ryu originated hence a possible reason for some experts noting similarities in the various waza that are shared. Eventually the art was promoted throughout the region by the Tanaka House, who were elders on council to the Lord of that area. During the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), the head of the art was named Tamatso Tanaka, the 12th generation head of the art. Its current popularity was due to Tanaka's appointment of Okura Hisajiro Naoyuki as Style head. Okura had a dojo in the Koiskikawa area of Tokyo. He had two senior students, Adachi Yushio who continued the tradition and also Naganuma Tsuneyuki, who married his daughter. As a result, Naganuma was given the responsibility of heading the art. He subsequently appointed his second son, Yoshiyuki, as the head of the art, he left the position and turned it over to a senior student named Ueno Takashi, after his fathers (Tsuneyuki) death, Yoshiyuki returned and began teaching the art again. There are conflicting stories as to who was appointed the successor to Ueno Takashi. Several branches sprang up in the coming years from various senior students. These senior students had no claims to succession. Each Started their own branches with their own characteristics. One such divergence belongs to the Nagano Ryu branch which teaches characteristics founded by Yukio Nakamura who was a student of the Head Master Okura Hisajiro Naoyuki in the Koikikawa Dojo near present-day Tokyo. However, there is another branch that claims Sato Kinbei as the successor in 1954, while another claims Kaminaga Shigemi was appointed. Kinbei taught many people the art of Asayama Ichiden Ryu. Given the amount of divergence in the art, it is entirely possible that many of these claims have some merit. The structure of the School Some of the schools teaching Asayama Ichiden Ryu are predominantly kenjutsu schools now. Many of those schools that teach the jujutsu/ taijutsu aspects of the art have codified the art into various levels including Shoden (first transmission), Chuden (middle level transmission), Okuden (hidden transmission), Kuden (oral transmission) amongst others. The original art's three main areas known as the: # Ten no Maki (Heaven Scroll) This scroll focused upon kenjutsu or the sword art # Jin no Maki (Man / Person Scroll) This scroll focused upon the arts of the staff known as bojutsu # Chi no Maki (Earth Scroll) This scroll focused upon empty hand defence techniques (jujutsu) Ueno Takashi attempted to keep the transmission of the art as pure as possible and to this end began an e-maki (picture scroll) which showed the kata of the school. Within this lineage, however, the transmission of waza was limited to the Chi no Maki and some Hishigi Den (literally ‚Äòcrushing transmission‚Äô or joint manipulation techniques) and kuden (oral transmission of \\"secrets\\") as these were the only areas transmitted forward by Naganuma Tsuneyuki.The Chi no Maki of traditional Asayama Ichiden Ryu is structured into several areas, versus the shoden, chuden, okuden etc. that are seen in many schools. The Chi no Maki has the following areas: # Gedan no Kurai # Chudan no Kurai # Jodan no Kurai # Okuden no Kurai # Shio no Kurai # Idori no Kurai There are several traditions still alive. Some of the better known traditions from the Asayama Ichiden Ryu Taijutsu are Chi no Maki, Okura-den, Yokohama-den, Jinenkan under Fumio Manaka, Genbukan under Tsunehisa (aka: Shoto) Tanemura, Nagano Ryu Heihou (Nagano Ryu Kyokai) under Jamie Ellerbe teaches a branch of Asayama Ichiden Ryu founded by Yukio Nakamura. This branch today is called Nagano Ryu Heihou but it is a rapidly growing branch in the United States and Japan. A student of Sato Kinbei, Duke Meade, lives in the US and teaches Asayama Ichiden-ryu amongst the other traditions he received from Sato Kinbei. Llermo Vendiola, menkyokaiden ( license holder ) of this school, is actively teaching Asayama Ichiden-ryu. Nakashima Atsumi, one of the menkyokaiden (license holder) of this school, is actively teaching Asayama Ichiden-ryu. A student of Kaminaga Shigemi Sensei, David Alonso (menkyo kaiden), lives in Japan and teaches Asayama Ichiden-ryu and Yagyu Shinkage-ryu in Nara Pref. Arts Taught The system teaches several weapon arts including kenjutsu, iaijutsu, kamajutsu', b≈çjutsu and unarmed arts (taijutsu). Jujutsu, Gyakute-jutsu. References * Skoss, Diane. Editor.

The programme featured ventriloquist Peter Brough and his doll Archie Andrews.The Sunday Post: Ventriloquism. Andrew Martin, BBC Genome Blog, 20 July 2017. Retrieved 23 July 2017. The show was very popular, despite its unlikely central premise of a ventriloquist act on radio. Educating Archie averaged 15 million listeners, and a fan club boasted 250,000 members. It was so successful that in 1950, after only four months on the air, it won the Daily Mails Variety Award. The programme introduced comedians who would go on to become well known, including Tony Hancock as Archie's tutor, who would greet Archie with a weary \\"Oh, it's you again\\" and always replied to any put-down from him with \\"flipping kids\\". Other \\"tutors\\" included Benny Hill, Harry Secombe, Dick Emery, Bernard Bresslaw, Hattie Jacques, and Bruce Forsyth ‚Äì together with a young Julie Andrews as Archie's girlfriend. Later, Beryl Reid took this role, playing the St Trinian's School-esque Monica with such catchphrases as \\"jolly hockey sticks\\" and \\"as the art mistress said to the gardener\\". Reid also played young Brummie girl Marleen, whose catchphrase was \\"Good evening, each\\". Max Bygraves later played Archie's tutor, with the catchphrases \\"I've arrived, and to prove it, I'm here\\" and \\"That's a good idea ... son!\\". The duo recorded two songs from the show on the HMV label: \\"The Dummy Song\\" and \\"Lovely Dollar Lolly\\".  ITV sitcom adaptation  In 1958, Educating Archie was adapted as a television sitcom produced by the ITV company Associated-Rediffusion and broadcast under the same name. This version, which was broadcast in 1958‚Äì9, featured the ventriloquist's dummy Archie Andrews taking on a life of its own, talking and walking all over its creator Peter Brough, aided and abetted by a housekeeper played by Irene Handl, a non-paying lodger played by Freddie Sales (later Ray Barrett), and a jack-of-all-trades played by Dick Emery.

It provides reportage, opinion and analysis of news, current affairs and sport in the towns of Falkirk, Grangemouth, Larbert and Denny as well as the neighbouring villages of Polmont, Redding, Brightons, Banknock and Bonnybridge. The paper's circulation area has a total population of 151,600, the fifth largest urban area in Scotland. The Falkirk Herald had an audited circulation of 21,937 in the six months from July-December 2012, making it the biggest selling local weekly newspaper in Scotland.Product Page - ABC It was named Weekly Newspaper of the Year at the 2013 Scottish Press Awards.Scottish Press Awards winners announded including Herald and Scotsman - Journalism News from HoldtheFrontPage Early years The front page of the first edition of The Falkirk Herald, published on 14 August 1845 The Falkirk Herald and Stirlingshire Monthly Advertiser was established by Alexander Hedderwick, a Glasgow-based lawyer. The first edition went on sale on Saturday, 14 August 1845.Your Falkirk Herald ... made in 1845 - Falkirk Herald Less than a year later the fledgling title was sold to Archibald Johnston, whose grandfather had first established a printing business in 1763. Johnston moved production of the Herald to Falkirk, and the first edition to be printed in the town went on sale on 13 August 1846. The Herald was the first newspaper purchased by the Johnston family, and the title's increasing size and influence would play a crucial part in growing the company which would become the present day Johnston Press publishing empire. The Falkirk Herald switched from monthly to weekly publication in 1851 and its first full-time editor, Mr J. Finlay, was appointed on the recommendation of Alexander Russell, editor of The Scotsman. During its first decade of publication the newspaper campaigned vigorously for Falkirk to be granted municipal burgh status. This would allow for the creation of a modern council to replace the medieval system of 'stentmasters' who had controlled local affairs for centuries and were widely viewed as incompetent. Burgh status would also mean the town could raise money needed to fund urban improvements, such as water supply and roadworks. A parliamentary bill enshrining these changes in law was eventually passed in 1859. Following the death of Archibald Johnston in 1877, control of the paper passed to his fourth son James, and eventually to Frederick, his youngest son, in 1882. Frederick Johnston was to remain as publisher of The Falkirk Herald for 53 years. Under his leadership, circulation of the Herald grew from around 7000 to 15,000 a week as public literacy rates improved and the demand for reading materials increased. In 1891, Johnston established the Linlithgow Gazette to serve the neighbouring county of Linlithgowshire. The author Neil Munro worked briefly as a journalist for the paper in 1890. The newspaper's staff moved into a purpose-built two-storey office in Falkirk High Street in 1909. Charity appeals The Falkirk Herald launched several notable appeals in the first decades of the 20th century. A fundraising drive on behalf of Belgian refugees from the First World War earned a formal thank you from the King of Belgium. In the aftermath of the Redding pit disaster in 1923, The Falkirk Herald appealed for its readers to give generously on behalf of the victims. The appeal raised a staggering ¬£63,000 ‚Äì equivalent to several million pounds today. In 1940 an appeal was launched to raise money to buy a Spitfire for the RAF. The paper's readership subsequently donated ¬£5,000, which was used to build a plane which was named ‚ÄòThe Falkirk Bairn‚Äô. It took to the skies in 1941, serving with three squadrons before being written off in combat in September 1942. Following the end of the war in 1945, The Falkirk Herald War Relief fund was launched to help injured soldiers, their families and prisoners of war. It raised ¬£8,100. Modern era The masthead was changed to The Falkirk Herald and Scottish Midlands Journal in the early 1920s, reflecting the paper's readership across central Scotland. Publication day was switched to Saturday, with a smaller 'pictorial' edition being produced on Wednesday. Frederick Mair Johnston became managing director of the Herald's parent company in 1936. Under his leadership, the family firm of F. Johnston & Company grew from publishing two newspapers to a total of 24. His son, Frederick Patrick Mair Johnston, took over the chairman's role, remaining at the helm until his retirement in 2001. Under his charge, the company made its first English acquisition, the Derbyshire Times. Further acquisitions followed in Yorkshire, Sussex and the Midlands. Circulation of The Falkirk Herald peaked at 40,000 in 1979, around the time production of the paper was threatened by a printer's strike. The Falkirk Herald left its office in the High Street in 1982, moving a short distance to Newmarket Street. The former Herald building is now a branch of W.H. Smith. In 1988, the Herald's parent firm F. Johnston & Co. Ltd was renamed Johnston Press and was floated on the Stock Exchange. Johnston Press went on to become the third largest publisher of regional newspapers in the United Kingdom. The paper celebrated its 150th anniversary on 14 August 1995. Letters of congratulation were received from Her Majesty The Queen and Prime Minister John Major, amongst others.Another milestone in Herald‚Äôs history - Falkirk Herald Production and printing of the newspaper moved to Camelon, a suburb of Falkirk, in 2001. In November 2010, all editorial and advertising staff moved to a new office in Grangemouth. A small office in Manor Street was opened to maintain a presence in Falkirk town centre. Under the editorship of George Guthrie, The Falkirk Herald was named Weekly Newspaper of the Year in 2000 the Scottish Press Awards and also took the title in 2008, 2009 and 2013 with Colin Hume at the helm. On 16 November 2018, Johnston Press announced it would place itself into administration after it was unable to find a suitable buyer to refinance its debt. The Falkirk Herald and the other Johnston Press titles were bought by JPIMedia on 17 November 2018 after a pre-packaged deal was agreed with creditors. Relaunch It was announced in the edition published on 26 October 2011 that the newspaper would switch to tabloid format the following week. The decision to end the paper's 166 years as a broadsheet was taken following the results of a consultation in which readers were asked to comment on the newspaper and its coverage. The Scottish Midlands Journal section of the masthead was dropped, with the paper now simply titled The Falkirk Herald. Digital age The first Falkirk Herald website was set up in 1996 by chief reporter Graeme Smith. It has undergone a series of relaunches in the years since and is now updated on a daily basis with breaking local news and sport, a range of columnists and items first published in the newspaper. It also has active Facebook and Twitter accounts.

On November 25, 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The church was founded on Easter Sunday in 1844, with the assistance of the Rev. Dr. Nicholas Hamner Cobbs, who was then rector of St. Paul's Church in Cincinnati. He helped \\"the Church-minded people in Newport\\" to organize their new congregation and the vestry considered him to be St. Paul's founder. Six months later the Rev. Mr. Cobbs was elected Bishop of Alabama. Later in 1844, the vestry bought the small Methodist brick church building on Court Place for $500. The \\"Methodist Meeting House was 30x40 feet, with side walls 11 feet high\\". In the front of the Methodist Church interior of the building there was a low gallery, without handrails, for the use of slaves, who came to meetings with their masters.\\" In 1845 St. Paul's was admitted into union with the Episcopal Diocese of Kentucky. In 1871 the cornerstone of the present St. Paul's was laid on the site of the old brick Methodist church. It is a Kentucky landmark designed by J. R. Neff. On a Sunday in August 1873, the bell in the tower first summoned parishioners to Morning Prayer. The cost of construction rose from $19,452 to over $33,000; the church was consecrated in 1888. Although the congregation continued to grow (by 1894 it was the largest parish in the Diocese), the vestry struggled with debt well into the twentieth century. The church and its people have weathered natural disasters of every magnitude, including an earthquake in 1880, the record-breaking Ohio River floods of 1884 and 1937, and the tornadoes of 1915 and 1986. Here worshipped Gen. James Taylor Jr., War of 1812; Henry Stanbery, who defended President Andrew Johnson at his impeachment trial, 1868; Brent Spence, 37 years in the United States Congress, a lifetime member. Today, St. Paul's has an active congregation. The Reverend S. Matthew Young serves as Rector. The congregation has now regained parish status in the Episcopal Church. In addition, St. Paul's operates the St. Paul's Food Pantry in Newport serving hundreds of households monthly. Holy Eucharist is celebrated at St. Paul's at 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. and holy days as announced.

A water salute occurs for ceremonial purposes when a vehicle travels under plumes of water expelled by one or more fire fighting vehicles. At an airport, typically an even number of vehicles will line up perpendicularly on the sides of the taxiway or apron, and the plumes of water will form a series of arches. Symbolically, the procession looks similar to a bridal party walking under a wedding arch or the saber arch at a military wedding. Water salutes have been used to mark the retirement of a senior pilot or air traffic controller, the first or last flight of an airline to an airport, the first or last flight of a type of aircraft, or other notable events. When the Concorde flew its last flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport, blue, white and red coloured plumes were used. United States President Donald Trump received a water salute on his first departure from LaGuardia Airport after winning the presidential election in 2016.

The kanji for Choken Battojutsu Kagery≈´ (ÊôØÊµÅ) means keshiki, or a scene. This is the original name of a ry≈´ from Yanagawa fief in Kyushu and it has not been changed since inception in the mid sixteenth century. There are many makimono (scrolls) and manuscripts and other evidence that contain the teachings of the school. The tradition also includes oral teachings (kuden) that have been handed down throughout the generations. History The founder of the Kagery≈´ was Yamamoto Hisaya Masakatsu of Akizuki domain. It is said that Yamamoto had observed a \\"scene\\" of a monkey reaching out with stick to retrieve a fruit from a tree. He then had the idea to use a longer weapon to \\"reach out\\". Others may hasten to add that a long blade is impractical. However, the added advantage is that, in learning to use a longer, heavier blade, a smaller, shorter one becomes even easier to wield. The Tokugawa shogunate standardized the size of swords in Japan to jo-sun. This is written as tei-sun meaning designated length.

The judge is removed from office if a majority of votes are cast against retention. A judicial retention vote differs from a regular election in that voters are not asked to choose from a list of candidates ‚Äî the judges on the ballot do not have opponents. Rather, the voter chooses between electing the incumbent judge to a further term in office (i.e. voting in favor of \\"retention\\") or voting against. In addition, the judge's party affiliation is typically not listed on the ballot. A judge is deemed to have been retained if ballots cast in favor of retention outnumber those against. By way of example, judicial retention elections are used in the U.S. state of Illinois. In the 2008 general election, the voters of Cook County, Illinois were asked to vote on the following: Additional instructions on the ballot made clear that \\"no judge listed is running against any other judge\\" and that voters were able to vote \\"yes\\" on both, \\"no\\" on both or \\"yes\\" on one and \\"no\\" on the other. History =California= In 1934, Judicial retention elections were first used by California's state court system to fill vacancies. (Text of the law may be seen below.) These retention elections served as an alternative to elections which were previously contested. After appointment by the governor and confirmation by the Commissioner on Judicial Appointments, an incumbent judge would appear on the ballot without an opponent and voters would vote for or against. If the judge received a majority of votes, he or she would be elected to serve. :California State Constitution: Article VI, Section 16 d. > (1) Within 30 days before August 16 preceding the expiration of the judge's > term, a judge of the Supreme Court or a court of appeal may file a > declaration of candidacy to succeed to the office presently held by the > judge. If the declaration is not filed, the Governor before September 16 > shall nominate a candidate. At the next general election, only the candidate > so declared or nominated may appear on the ballot, which shall present the > question whether the candidate shall be elected. The candidate shall be > elected upon receiving a majority of the votes on the question. In 1937, the American Bar Association endorsed retention elections for judges. =Missouri Plan= Growing distaste of politics and corruption affecting the gubernatorial appointments of judges brought about the reform when selecting judges. In 1940, the state of Missouri adopted the Missouri Plan, which contained a judicial retention process similar to that of California. This plan which is also known as the merit system, was proposed by Albert M. Kales, co-founder of the American Judicature Society. Under the Missouri Plan, judges were to be nominated by a council of lawyers and laypersons. A list of candidates would then go to the governor, who would choose a candidate. It was noted that the Missouri Plan needed a form of public accountability so it was decided that, after an election cycle had passed, the judicial candidate would be subject to periodic, public retention elections. Usage =Japan= The Constitution of Japan, drafted by the U.S. authorities during the occupation of Japan following World War II, effected a similar arrangement for justices of the Supreme Court of Japan. =United States= Retention elections are used in many U.S. state court systems to retain trial court and appellate court judges. The following 20 states use retention elections for at least some judges: *Alaska1,2 *Arizona1,2 (some trial judges are elected). *California1 *Colorado1,2 *Florida1 *Idaho2 *Illinois1,2 *Indiana1 *Iowa1,2 *Kansas1,2 *Maryland1 *Missouri1,2 *Nebraska1,2 *New Mexico1,2 (57% 'yes' votes needed for retention) *Oklahoma1 *Pennsylvania1,2 *South Dakota1 *Tennessee1 *Utah1,2 *Wyoming1,2 1 Appellate court retention election 2 Trial court retention election Criticism Many legal scholars disapprove of any form of judicial elections on the grounds that they may undermine the independence of the courts and encourage judges to act as politicians. It is argued that of the three branches of government (legislature, executive, and judiciary) the judicial branch should be the least concerned with public opinion, but that retention elections cause judges to take into account the view of the electorate when deciding cases. It is also argued that retention elections may lead to corruption because to successfully run for public office money and campaigning is needed. This may allow interest groups to take advantage of the system by giving money in exchange for favourable rulings by individual judges.

The Preservation Resource Center is a non-profit organization which promotes the historic preservation of buildings and architecture in New Orleans. Mission New Orleans is a city famous for its architecture. From the townhouse apartments of the French Quarter to the shotgun houses of Uptown, New Orleans features a wide array of architectural styles, styles which are often unique to the city. It is a visible testament to the rich history and culture of the city. However, New Orleans has suffered from the same problems with sinking property values and urban decline as other major cities. Many historic structures have been threatened with demolition. Even the now famous French Quarter was once a neglected immigrant ghetto in the early 20th century, which was also threatened with destruction. In the 1960s, there had been a serious attempt by the federal government to demolish the French Quarter's scenic riverfront and replace it with an interstate highway.http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/neworleans.htm The Preservation Resource Center promotes the protection of historic architecture in New Orleans, which it believes are vital to the economy, culture, and aesthetics of the city. The organization also advocates the involvement of citizens and communities in the restoration of historic neighborhoods and buildings. Most of the organization's programs are directed toward several target historic neighborhoods in the city. Organization The Preservation Resource Center was founded in 1974. It is governed by a president and a board of directors. As of 2006, the Preservation has 21 full-time and part-time employees and annual budget of $1.4 million. Its numerous outreach and renovation projects rely on federal grants, donations, and a community of volunteers and members. The offices of the Preservation Resource Center are located in the historic Leeds-Davis Building in the Warehouse District, near the National World War II Museum and Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. The building was built by the noted New Orleans architect James Gallier in 1853, during the antebellum period of New Orleans history. The structure features a restored cast-iron Gothic Revival facade. Preservation purchased the Leeds-Davis Building in March 1998, and financed an extensive modernization and renovation of the structure for the next two years. It moved into its new office on November 11, 2000. The building features a classroom and a showroom on the first floor. The office is located at 923 Tchoupitoulas Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130. Phone: (504) 581.7032. E-Mail: prc@prcno.org. Activities =Advocacy= The Preservation Resource Center is politically active in supporting legislation which favors historic preservation and works to prevent legislation which favors unrestricted development. In the past, the organization has lobbied for legislation which saved the federal tax credit for historic rehabilitation, created a property tax abatement for home renovation, and established zoning measures which favored historic neighborhoods and properties. The organization frequently joins neighborhood associations in city planning sessions with the New Orleans City Council and other government agencies. It has been involved in legal cases which have prevented the demolition of specific houses and neighborhoods. =Education= The Preservation Resource Center sponsors several events and information workshops for homeowners each year. Many of these seminars are held in the organization's office building, and they are open and free of charge to the general public. The organization also publishes material relating to the renovation of historic homes and buildings. The organization has a monthly magazine, Preservation in Print, which publicizes events relating to historic preservation, and features articles on historic neighborhoods and buildings. =Operation Comeback= Operation Comeback promotes the purchasing and renovation of vacant historic properties, instead of the demolition of existing structures and the construction of new buildings. Established in 1987, the original objective of the program was the revitalization of the Coliseum neighborhood in the Lower Garden District. Today, Operation Comeback helps prospective homeowners locate and purchase renovated historic houses throughout the city. The program also holds interviews with homeowners and helps them finance and organize renovation projects. =Rebuilding Together= Originally established as \\"Christmas in October\\" in 1988, Rebuilding Together is a neighborhood revitalization program which renovates the homes of elderly, low-income, disabled homeowners. Homeowners who own a historic house can apply to have their homes renovated, and the renovations are done at no cost to the homeowners. The program relies on volunteer labor and donated supplies to perform the renovations. Both skilled and unskilled labor are invited to join the program.

In euphorbia milii-large A cyathium (plural: cyathia) is one of the specialised pseudanthia (\\"false flowers\\") forming the inflorescence of plants in the genus Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae). A cyathium consists of: * Five (rarely four) bracteoles. These are small, united bracts, which form a cup-like involucre. Their upper tips are free and in the beginning cover the opening of the involucre (like the shutter of a camera). These alternate with: * Five (1 to 10) nectar glands, which are sometimes fused. * One extremely reduced female flower standing in the centre at the base of the involucre, consisting of an ovary on a short stem with pistil, and surrounded by: * Five groups (one group at the base of each bracteole) of extremely reduced male flowers, which each consist of a single anther on a stem. The flower-like characteristics of the cyathia are underlined by brightly coloured nectar glands and often by petal-like appendages to the nectar glands, or brightly coloured, petal-like bracts positioned under the cyathia. The paired petal-like bracts of Euphorbia section Goniostema are called cyathophylls. here female to male flower ratio is 1:Œ± The cyathia are sometimes solitary, but are usually in cymes, inflorescences of the second order, in pseudumbels, on dichotomously branched stalks or in so-called simple cymes which consist of one central and two lateral cyathia. In one group of Madagascan species in the subfamily Euphorbia section Goniostema (E. aueoviridiflora, E. capmanambatoensis, E. iharanae, E. leuconeura, E. neohumbertii, E. viguieri) there is a tendency for a further pseudanthium to grow from the cyme. Probably as an adaptation to pollination by birds, the cyathia have become specialised: Most cyathia have upright cyathophylles which surround them protectively, but render the nectar glands inaccessible. To compensate, between them are naked sterile cyathia whose only job is to produce nectar.  References  * Sandro Pignatti, Flora d'Italia, Edagricole, Bologna 1982.

The Russian word \\"Eralash\\" means \\"jumble\\". Description Like whist and bridge, Eralash is played by foursomes divided into two partnerships facing each other, although it is possible to play variants of the game with only two or three players. It was a popular game in Russia before the Soviet era. Gameplay A full bridge deck of 52 cards is completely dealt out to the players for each hand. The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Like whist, partners are determined by drawing cards, trump is determined by the last card dealt, and verbal strategy and planning (table talk) is not allowed. Partners work together to secure as many tricks as possible. Points are awarded for any tricks taken in a hand in excess of 7 ‚Äî in other words, a partnership taking 8 tricks is awarded 1 point. The first partnership to gain 13 points wins the robber. =Terminology= * Leva A trick * Robber A game consisting of 13 points * Secant A few cards in the same suit, starting from Ace. * Singleton A hand containing a single card of any suit. * Comet When a card is trumped by both opposing players. * Invit One player plays the lowest card of the strongest suit, inviting their partner to play the highest card. * Sext major Six cards in order, from ace to nine inclusive. * Quarte major Four cards in order, from ace to jack inclusive. * Terz Major Ace, King and Queen. * Force By leading a suit that your opponent does not have, you force the player to trump. * To have tenas To have the first and third of the highest cards and be the last in the game in order. Mentions in Russian literature Fyodor Dostoevsky, Demons : His whole figure seemed to exclaim ‚ÄúCards! Me sit down to jumble with you! Is it consistent? Who is responsible for it? Who has shattered my energies and turned them to jumble? Ah, perish, Russia!‚Äù and he would majestically trump with a heart. Ivan Turgenev, Fathers and Sons : \\"Indeed? After dinner, then, we will have a jumble, and I will despoil him utterly.\\" : \\"Ha, ha, ha!

Founded by Adam Werbach in 1991, it now has about 14,000 members and is almost entirely student-led.  National-level  The Sierra Student Coalition is directed by a paid National Director. The SSC is governed by a seven-member volunteer Executive Committee (Ex-Com). The Ex-Com sets the national campaign priorities of the SSC and is responsible for allocating the annual budget, prioritizing national campaigns, and serving the volunteer membership and Chapter structure of the SSC. Every ExCom member also serves on a subcommittee, the venues where the rest of the SSC's national activities are organized. The current SSC Ex-Com, for 2015-2016, consists of Caroline Engle, Courtney Pal, Mitchelle De Leon, Gabby Benavente, Maria Langholz, Drew O'Bryan, and Jacqueline Yap. The other major committees include: The Campaign Committee (CampCom). Camp-Com is responsible for planning and developing the SSC's national campaign priorities, including development of relevant campaign resources in coordination with SSC staff. The SSC's current priority campaign is \\"Campuses Beyond Coal\\". The campaign is designed to be run on college campuses or in local communities. The Trainings Committee. Trainings-Com teaches the skills that the SSC's member activists use to organize. In coordination with the SSC Trainings Director, the Trainings-Com is responsible for conducting Summer Environmental Training Programs (SPROG) during the summer. They also run workshops at regional and national conferences and train students who want to become trainers themselves. The Anti-Oppression Committee (AO Com). AO Com works to establish Anti- Oppression as an integral part of the SSC in order to encourage diversity, inclusivity, and the open exchange of ideas. In addition, AO Com also creates an open and safe space for the SSC through the implementation of AO curriculum in SSC gatherings, including SPROG. AO Com adamantly creates and/or adjusts any projects, policies, or initiatives to integrate AO principles within the SSC at both a grassroots and national level. Collaboration and input from all SSCers between all committees is used to accomplish these goals.SSC Committees Web Page  Chapter-level  The lifeblood of the SSC is a nationwide network of Campus and Community Organizers. These organizers are the students who win the victories that advance the SSC and the student environmental movement. Campus Organizers organize SSC groups that run local campaigns on their high school or college campus. These local campaigns are usually consistent with SSC priority issue focus at the national and state-level. Community Organizers bring together existing SSC campus groups and group leaders and/or recruiting non-SSC groups to the SSC that are within a close geographic proximity. These groups pursue a local campaign that is usually consistent with the SSC's national issue focus. A community organizer position only becomes available once there are at least two functioning and registered SSC campus groups within a community to organize and coordinate. Community Organizers often utilize Sierra Club as a recruitment partner. A Chapter Organizing Team (or State ExCom) is formed when there are multiple campus groups or community campaigns that work together on a statewide campaign. The Chapter Organizing Team is a collection of the Community Organizers throughout a state. They mentor Campus Organizers and planning state trainings or conferences.  Priority Campaign: The Campus Climate Challenge  The Campus Climate Challenge is a project of more than 30 leading youth organizations throughout the U.S. and Canada, including the Sierra Student Coalition. The Challenge leverages the power of young people to organize on college campuses and high schools across Canada and the U.S. to win 100% clean energy policies at their schools. The goal of the Challenge is to grow a generation-wide movement to stop global warming, by reducing carbon emissions from their high schools and colleges down to zero, and leading society to a clean energy future.Campus Climate Challenge Website During the summer of 2007 the Sierra Student Coalition worked in partnership with the Sierra Club and the US Steelworks Union, in New Hampshire and Iowa to reach out to citizens to call for action to cut carbon emissions 80% by 2050 and to create 2 million new jobs in a clean energy economy.

History After gaining its independence in 1917 and after the Finnish Civil War of 1918, large numbers of Model 1891 Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles were in the hands of the Finnish military. As the old barrels were worn out, they were replaced by new 7.83 mm (.308 in) barrels and the leftover 7.62√ó54mmR cartridges being in short supply, a domestic product was needed. This gave birth to the 7.62√ó53mmR. In the late 1930s the Finnish Army started loading military cartridges with domestically produced 7.87 mm (.310 in) diameter D166 bullets as the production of new M39 \\"Ukko-Pekka\\" rifles barreled for 7.62√ó54R diameter bullets started. This change was due in part to allow the use of captured Soviet ammunition and machine gun ammunition which often was of a slightly greater bore diameter than its Finnish counterparts. The rifling twist rate was also changed from 300 mm (1 in 11.81 in) to 254 mm (1 in 10 in).Finnish Model 1939 (M39) Service Rifle The 7.62√ó53mmR cartridge remains in military use to this day, although it is now only used by the 7.62 TKIV 85 sniper rifle. PKM machine guns and other Russian weapons in use by the Finnish Defence Forces use the 7.62√ó54mmR exclusively. The Finnish Defence Forces issued instructions that when ever possible, personnel issued with a rifle chambered for 7.62√ó53mmR (effectively the TKIV 85 rifle) should use 7.62√ó53mmR ammunition only, and that use of 7.62√ó54mmR is only allowed when 7.62√ó53mmR is not available. Cartridge dimensions The 7.62√ó53mmR has 4.16 ml (64 grains) H2O cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions. 400px 7.62√ó53mmR maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions.All sizes in millimeters (mm).C.I.P.

The Russian ammunition maker Barnaul states that Russian cartridges marked 7.62√ó53 are the same as 7.62√ó54. From their web site: \\"Some hunters have been confused because there have been varying marking on the package, case bottom and stamps: 7.62√ó53: 7.62√ó53R: 7.62√ó54: 7.62√ó54R. This happened because the 53.72 mm case length was rounded off differently in various countries. After Russia became a member of the European Permanent Coordinated Commission, the final name - \\"7.62√ó54R\\" - of the cartridge was accepted. \\" Additionally, Russian ammunition manufacturer LVE (Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant) states, \\"The cartridges cal.7,62√ó54R are produced by various producers around the world. Producers mark these cartridges differently, and this leads to confusion among the customers ‚Äì 7.62—Ö53; 7.62√ó53R; 7.62—Ö54; 7.62√ó54R. The confusion is based on difference in rounding out (rounding up or rounding down) the case length (case length of our cartridges is 53.65-0.2 mm). The letter \\"R\\" indicates a case rim. After Russia‚Äôs joining European Commission (–ü–ú–ö) a definite name of this cartridge was determined ‚Äì 7,62√ó54R.

The trunkline travels from the city of Saginaw at the junction with M-13 to the junction with M-53 east of Cass City over the county line in Greenleaf Township in northwestern Sanilac County in The Thumb area of the state. Outside of the cities and villages along its route, M-81 passes through mostly rural farm country. Near Saginaw it intersects the freeway that carries both Interstate 75 (I-75) and US Highway 23 (US 23) in an industrial area. A road bearing the M-81 designation has existed since at least July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was the construction of a pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US 23 interchange in 2006. Route description M-81 starts at a junction with M-13, with the two directions of each highway separated by a median. This central feature ends for M-81 immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of Saginaw. The trunkline follows Washington Road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with I-75/US 23 in an industrial area of Buena Vista Township. This interchange, exit 151 along the freeway, is built with roundabouts on either side of the bridge that carries Washington Road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called a dumbbell interchange. After leaving the industrial properties on the east side of I-75/US 23, M-81 follows Washington Road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. North of the community of Arthur, the highway intersects M-15 (Vassar Road). Further east, M-81 crosses out of Saginaw County; across the border in Tuscola County, the highway follows Saginaw Road. In the village of Reese, M-81 crosses the Huron and Eastern Railway twice. East of town, the highway follows Caro Road through more farm fields through the community of Watrousville. Near the south side of the Tuscola Area Airport, M-81 turns to the northeast running along the Cass River to Caro. In the city, the trunkline follows State Street past the fairgrounds. At the intersection with Ellington Street, M-81 crosses M-24. The highway continues northeasterly out of town and through the community of Ellington. Northeast of Elmwood, M-81 turns due east along Cass City Road. The trunkline runs to the village of Cass City where it follows Main Street through residential neighborhoods and the central business district. East of Cass City, the highway crosses the Cass River before crossing the county line into Sanilac County. Approximately into the county, M-81 ends at the intersection with M-53 (Van Dyke Road). M-81 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-81 were the 17,839 vehicles daily between Van Gelsen Road and Frank Street in Caro; the lowest counts were the 3,527 vehicles per day east of Cass City to the M-53 intersection. No sections of M-81 have been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History When originally signed around July 1, 1919, M-81 ran from Bay City southeast and east to the Munger area; from there it ran south concurrently with M-31 to the Reese area before running northeasterly to the east of Cass City to M-53. By 1921, the eastern end was extended southerly from Caro to Mayville along a highway that is now part of M-24. In late 1926, the western end was changed so that M-81 followed the former M-31 from Reese into Saginaw and the eastern end was rerouted from Caro northeasterly to the Cass City area. With the exception of the routing through downtown Saginaw, the highway followed the approximate routing of the current highway. In the latter half of 1929, the highway was rerouted between Saginaw and Reese, using a set of parallel roadways to the south of the previous routing; this change was reversed in 1933. M-81 was fully paved when the last section between Ellington and Elmwood in Tuscola County was finished in late 1946 or early 1947. Starting in 1953, the westernmost approximately of M-81 was also used for a US 23 concurrency. When the bypass of Saginaw was completed in late 1961, M-81 was extended along M-13 southwesterly into downtown Saginaw where it turned west across the Saginaw River to Midland Road west of the city. This routing across the city was removed in 1971 when I-675 was completed; west of that freeway the highway became M-58, the rest was either removed from the highway system and turned back to local control, or it had the M-81 designation removed. Since this truncation, M-81 has ended at its junction with M-13 north of downtown Saginaw. In 2006, MDOT completed the reconstruction of the interchange between M-81 and I-75/US to incorporate a pair of roundabouts along Washington Road.

Despite breaking up in 1999, they have reunited several times in order to raise money for charity, and have produced a DVD. History Billy Campion met Bill and Brendan Ryan in the late 1970s. Sharing a passion for music, they started a band, The Plummers. During college, the group picked up bassist Mark Wike, drummer Clive Tucker and percussionist P. J. O'Connor. With this lineup, the band called itself The Bogmen, in honor of what Campion called its \\"tribal, huntish\\" sound.The Bogmen: biography In 1995, after playing at every bar, club and retirement home in the Tri state area, the band from Long Island was signed to Arista Records and released its first album \\"Life Begins at 40 Million\\" which was produced by Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads.(May 24, 2010) The band then concentrated on live shows and toured around the US with bands such as Barenaked Ladies, before releasing the 1997 live album \\"Bogmen Live\\" which was also released by Arista. After switching producers, the band then tapped Bill Laswell and Godfrey Diamond before heading back into the studio and recorded the album _Close Captioned Radio_ in 1998 before disbanding.

The section between Newaygo and Howard City travels through Fremont and along the southern edge of Manistee National Forest. The current version of M-82 is actually the second in the state; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919. The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s. Various extensions and truncations have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or Hesperia in the past. The current route was finalized in the late 1970s Route description M-82 begins at a junction with M-120 and B-96 west of Fremont. This junction is at a tripoint of county lines. M-120 forms the north‚Äìsouth Newaygo‚ÄìOceana and Newaygo‚ÄìMuskegon county lines. B-96, which forms the east‚Äìwest Oceana‚ÄìMuskegon county line runs due west of the intersection. M-82 exits the intersection to the east. The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of Fremont. The road, now called Main Street, passes through the downtown area and M-82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town. The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land. As the trunkline approaches Newaygo, the terrain becomes more wooded near the Muskegon River. M-82 follows Fremont Street east to a junction with M-37. The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street. South of downtown, M-82 turns east again, independent of M-37, and runs along 82nd Street on the southern edge of the Manistee National Forest. The east end of M-82 is at exit 118 on US 131/M-46 west of Howard City. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), as a part of its maintenance responsibilities, tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways. These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year. In 2009, the department's measurements indicated that a segment of M-82 west of Fremont had the peak volume for the highway at 16,532 vehicles daily. The traffic nadir was 4,018 vehicles east of Newaygo. In addition, MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History =Previous designation= The first usage of M-82 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1, 1919. The trunkline started at M-25 and ran north of Newberry to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner. It was later replaced by M-48 in 1926. =Current designation= The current M-82 dates back to 1926. It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M-46 in Howard City. The highway was routed through Ferry, Hesperia and Fremont, replacing M-41. In late 1936, M-46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City, forming a M-46/M-82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M-46 routing. This concurrent section became just M-46 in 1938, shortening M-82 back to the northern M-37 junction in Newaygo. The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948. Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart, it was continued west to end in Shelby. Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again. This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era, bypassing Ferry. A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County. M-20 replaced M-82 west of Hesperia, to end at New Era instead of Muskegon. The new M-120 designation replaced M-20 south of Hesperia. M-82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only. The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City. M-46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs, and replaced M-57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia. This freed up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M-82 designation. The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M-120 was eliminated in favor of M-120. The M-82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont, resulting in the current highway routing.

Music publisher Frank Harding has been credited with innovating the sales method. Tin Pan Alley Typically, the pianist sat on the mezzanine level of a store and played whatever music was sent up to him by the clerk of the store selling the sheet music. Patrons could select any title, have it delivered to the song plugger, and get a preview of the tune before buying it. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, those who worked in department and music stores were most often known as \\"song demonstrators\\", while those who worked directly for music publishers were called \\"song pluggers.\\" Musicians and composers who had worked as song pluggers included George Gershwin, Ron Roker, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and Lil Hardin Armstrong. Movie executive Harry Cohn was a song plugger.

Biography He was born in Cotignola in 1409, an illegitimate son of the famous condottiero Muzio Attendolo Sforza. Alessandro collaborated actively with his brother Francesco in his military campaign, and with him he conquered Milan, Alessandria and Pesaro. In 1435, at Fiordimonte, he won the battle in which the riotous Niccol√≤ Fortebraccio was killed. In 1442 at Assisi he commanded the troops besieged by Pope Eugene IV's condottiero Francesco Piccinino. He was forced to leave the city, abandoning the city to ravages and massacres. In 1444 he obtained the lordship of Pesaro by Galeazzo Malatesta. Here he enlarged the Ducal Palace to conform it to the Renaissance standards. During the Wars in Lombardy in support of Francesco he presided Parma and, in February 1446, he proclaimed himself lord of the city. After Francesco's conquest of the Duchy of Milan, the Peace of Lodi (1454) confirmed him in Parma. In 1464 he obtained by Pope Pius II the seigniory of Gradara, which he defended by the Malatesta attempts of reconquest. He died in 1473 from an attack of apoplexy. His son Costanzo succeeded him in Pesaro. Family He married Costanza Varano (1428‚Äì1447), the daughter of Pietro Gentile I da Varano, on 8 December 1444. She died while bearing Costanzo. The following year he married to Sveva da Montefeltro (1434‚Äì1478), daughter of Guidantonio da Montefeltro, count of Urbino. In 1457, fearing a possible conjure of the Malatesta family to regain the seigniory of Pesaro, he obliged her to become a nun in a monastery in the city. By Costanza he had two children, Battista (1446‚Äì1472), who became the wife of Federico III of Urbino, and Costanzo. He also had an illegitimate daughter, Ginevra (c. 1440‚Äì1507), known as a patron of the visual and literary arts. She married Sante Bentivoglio in 1454 and, after his death, Giovanni II Bentivoglio, duke of Bologna.

He was mobilized in August 2005 and deployed to Iraq in November 2005. During his tenure in the United States Army, Altaie served as a linguist.Ryan, John, \\"Search for Iraq-born soldier still ongoing\\", Military Times, 27 December 2011. =Prisoner of war= On 23 October 2006, Al-Taie left his military base in Iraq without authorization or the knowledge of his superiors. It is believed that he was in the Karrada neighborhood in central Baghdad, Iraq to visit the family of his second wife, Israa Abdul-Satar, a student at al-Mustansiriya University. He was captured by armed men and forced into a waiting vehicle outside. On 2 November 2006, a ransom demand for Altaie was relayed to his uncle Entifadh Qanbar, a former spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress and recently an official in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. Qanbar made contact with an intermediary trusted by the kidnappers. In a secret location in Baghdad, the mediator met with members of the group who showed Qanbar a grainy video on a cell phone screen of a man they claimed was Altaie, beaten up and bloody, and demanded $250,000 from the soldier's family to secure his release. Qanbar stated that he would not talk about a price until he had seen for himself some proof that Altaie was still breathing. Qanbar suggested they have his nephew describe the inside of his home in Ann Arbor or that the kidnappers photograph the soldier holding a current newspaper by 4 November 2006 at 12:00pm. The U.S. government said on 11 November 2006 that it was offering a US$50,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of Altaie's body. On 14 February 2007, a proof of life video of Al-Taie was posted on a militant Shiite website. A previously unknown group called the \\"Ahel al-Beit Brigades\\" claimed responsibility for Altaie's abduction. The eight second video showed Altaie reading from a paper but no audio was heard. He appeared thin but in good health. His uncle identified him as the man in the video. Al-Taie was the last U.S. serviceman to be accounted for in Iraq. He was captured when he was the rank of specialist and was promoted to sergeant, then staff sergeant. On 26 February 2012, U.S. military officers knocked on the door of the family home in Ann Arbor, Michigan with news that Army Staff Sgt. Ahmed Al-Taie was confirmed dead. The remains of Al- Taie were turned over as part of an amnesty exchange agreement between the Iraqi government and the militant group Asaib Ahl al-Haq.

M-83 is primarily a north‚Äìsouth trunkline that passes by such landmarks as Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn before leaving town. The landscape in the remainder of the area is composed of farm fields between Frankenmuth and the northern terminus at M-15 near Richville. Previously, the M-83 designation was used for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in The Thumb area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. The gap between the two roads was eliminated within a year. By the end of the 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing The Thumb area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962. Route description M-83 starts at exit 136 along I-75/US 23 just north of the outlet mall in Birch Run; this interchange is also the northern terminus of M-54. The two highways run concurrently east from the freeway along Birch Run Road, crossing Dixie Highway. The landscape away from the freeway is predominantly fields through the area. Traveling eastward along this roadway, a motorist is on either northbound M-83 or southbound M-54, making these a wrong-way concurrency. At the intersection with Gera Road, the two trunklines diverge when M-54 turns southward. From here, M-83 turns due north for about into Frankenmuth. Wrong-way concurrency along Birch Run Road The trunkline curves to the northwest around Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, which bills itself as the \\"World's Largest Christmas Store\\"; the store has under one roof devoted to Christmas merchandise. Further north, M-83 follows Main Street over the Cass River into downtown Frankenmuth. North of the river are Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn, restaurants known for their \\"world famous\\" chicken dinners. The city is known as \\"Michigan's Little Bavaria\\"; the area was settled by German Lutherans in the 19th century. Today, buildings and even road signs are erected in the Bavarian theme. North of downtown, the highway passes through a commercial area and out of the city. The landscape returns to farm fields as M-83 follows Gera Road due north again. The highway passes through the community of Gera and crosses a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. North of the railroad, the trunkline intersects M-46 (Holland Road). After this intersection, M-83 continues about a mile and a half (2.4 km) and ends at a four-way intersection with M-15 (Vassar Road) near Richville while Gera Road continues as a county road. M-83 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2011 showed that the highest traffic level along M-83 was 17,240 vehicles daily between the I-75/US 23 interchange and Dixie Highway in Birch Run; the lowest count was 2,316 vehicles per day at the northern terminus. No section of M-83 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History =Previous designation= The first designation of M-83 was in place by July 1, 1919, for a routing along the Mohawk‚ÄìGay Road between the communities of the same name in Keweenaw County in the Upper Peninsula. This designation lasted until late 1926 when it was replaced by a northerly extension of M-26. The second designation of M-83 replaced M-31 across The Thumb between Bay Port and Harbor Beach, along what is today M-142. =Current designation= The current designation was assigned in 1929 as a second, disconnected section of highway. This new routing ran from US 10/US 23 in Clio by way of Frankenmuth to Reese. The gap between the two sections was filled in a year later when M-84 in Tuscola County was redesignated as part of M-83. After this change, M-83 continued north from Reese through Gilford and Akron to Unionville. There it ran concurrently along M-29 to Bay Port, connecting the two segments. The eastern segment first designated in 1926 was separated from the rest of the highway in 1939. The northern end was scaled back to M-15/M-24 in Saginaw County. The concurrency along M-81 was removed, the section northeast to Gilford was transferred to local control, and the section northeast of Guilford to Unionville was added to M-138. The Bay Port‚ÄîHarbor Beach section was redesignated M-142. The last changes came around 1962 when the I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway was completed between Pontiac and Flint. M-83 was rerouted on its south end to turn west along Birch Run Road to the freeway, concurrent with the new M-54, which replaced M-83 south of Birch Run Road.

It is the former New Orleans city hall, and continues in civic use. Built 1845‚Äì1853, it is a nationally significant example of Greek Revival architecture, and one of the finest works of architect James Gallier. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Description and history Gallier Hall is located on St. Charles Avenue at Lafayette Square in the Central Business District. The building was originally designed to be the city hall of New Orleans by the architect, James Gallier Sr. Construction began in 1845, and the building was dedicated on 10 May 1853. Gallier Hall is a three- story marble structure fronted by two rows of fluted Ionic columns in the Neoclassical style. It is one of the most important structures built during the antebellum period of the city. After its dedication in 1853, Gallier Hall remained the city hall for just over a century. Many important events during the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the era of Louisiana governor Huey Long took place at Gallier Hall. After the City Hall was moved to the modern complex at Duncan Plaza in the 1950s, old Gallier Hall nonetheless continued its traditional place of honor during Mardi Gras. Viewing galleries in front of the hall are reserved for Mardi Gras royalty, and parades on the St. Charles route pause in front of them. Marching bands typically perform shows here during the parades. On Mardi Gras Day the mayor of New Orleans toasts the kings of the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and Rex Parade here. Gallier Hall is currently a convention center, reception hall, and home of the Ty Tracy Theatre, named for the late artistic director of the New Orleans Recreation Department (NORD) Theatre. The Ty Tracy Theatre is home to Julie Condy's Crescent City Lights Youth Theatre organization. The building also serves as the venue for special civic functions such as mayoral inaugurations. The remains of particularly distinguished citizens sometimes lie in state here following their death, as a sign of deep citywide respect.

The three-hour event is held in Salt Lake City starting at 9:00 a.m. MDT on July 24, the same day as Pioneer Day, a Utah state holiday.  History  On July 24, 1847, Brigham Young and a company of Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, where the Latter-day Saints settled after being forced from Nauvoo, Illinois and other locations in the eastern United States. Pulling handcarts or driving wagons with oxen or horses, thousands of pioneers carried a firm commitment to America's belief in freedom of religion as they made the trek across the plains to a vast desert landscape that became known as the Utah Territory. According to Days of '47 Inc. \\"This trek of the early Utah pioneers exemplifies the courage, foresight, and faith that continue to inspire modern-day pioneers. By remembering those remarkable 1847 pioneers and all those who followed, The Days of '47 seeks to make their accomplishments and hardships live today through a variety of activities and celebrations each year. We believe the example of past and present pioneers' courage is a beacon to the world.\\" A parade was held on July 24, 1849, in Salt Lake City, long before Days of '47 became an official organization. Beginning in 1931, the \\"'Covered Wagon Days\\" parade became an annual event. Since the 1940s, the parade has been known by its current name. LDS Church wards and stakes, businesses, and community groups have always sponsored floats in the parade. Recently, the parade has become more inclusive, with other churches participating and celebrating their own Utah pioneers. Native Americans march in the pre-parade, which travels down the parade route ahead of the pioneer floats. The military has always been well represented, and of course it always includes horses, bands, children and queens. For many years, pioneers who arrived in the valley before 1869 were honored with a dinner each July 24. The last living pioneer died 1 Jan 1968. Her name was Hilda Erickson and she was 108 years old. There was no parade in 1943 because of World War II or in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Performers and acts  In addition to the well-known floats, the parade also features live music and other performances. High school marching bands from across the state participate in the parade, and the television broadcasts feature performances by the bands.  Television coverage  The parade is televised throughout the intermountain area on NBC affiliate KSL-TV.  Parade route  The parade route starts at South Temple and State Street, goes east to 200 East, south to 900 South, then east to Liberty Park at 600 East. Traditionally a fair is held at Liberty Park, with games and rides. For many decades, the parade started at Temple Square, went south on Main Street, turned east at 9th South, and continued heading east toward Liberty Park where the parade always ended.  Controversy and criticism  In 2014, Mormons Building Bridges, a group which works to improve relations between the LDS and LGBT communities, sought entry to march in the parade, but was denied because the group was deemed too controversial by the parade organizers. In response, the Salt Lake City Council considered boycotting their invitation to participate in the parade, but ultimately decided against a boycott as a Council, instead opting to simply express their opposition to the exclusion of Mormons Building Bridges. Council member Erin Mendenhall chose to decline her invitation to participate in the parade when after submitting the bio of her guest, a gay stay-at-home father married to a man, the organizers of the parade returned that only immediate relatives were eligible as guests of the Council. Previously, the Council had been informed they could bring \\"one adult guest\\".

First elected in 1942, he was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives for eleven terms, from January 3, 1943 to January 3, 1965. Horan represented the Fifth Congressional District of Washington, which included Spokane and Wenatchee. Early life A fruit grower and packer, Horan was born and raised near Wenatchee, the younger son of Michael and Margaret A. (Rankin) Horan. His father Mike (1854-1919) was a pioneer fruit grower in the valley and the son of Irish immigrants. Walt served in the U.S. Navy as a gunner's mate during World War I, and earned a bachelor's degree from Washington State College in Pullman in 1925. His wife, Helen L. \\"Sally\\" Campbell of Eureka, Montana, was a college classmate. Horan and his older brother John (1896-1954) operated one of the largest fruit ranches in the state. He ran for Congress in 1942, primarily to improve the representation of the agricultural sector.  Congressional career  Horan ran for Congress in 1940 from the 5th congressional district, but lost the general election to the two-term incumbent, Democrat Charles H. Leavy. Leavy resigned in August 1942 to become a federal judge on the U.S. District Court in western Washington, which left the seat vacant. In the Republican primary in September, Horan defeated Spokane attorney and civic leader Joe Albi, then easily defeated former two-term U.S. Senator and 1940 gubernatorial candidate Clarence Dill in the general election in November. Horan's victory was the first win by a Republican in the district in twenty years.

It runs from near North Branch eastward to Lexington situated on Lake Huron. The highway is a lightly traveled roadway that runs through rural farmlands. The trunkline runs mostly east‚Äìwest with two short north‚Äìsouth segments where it turns to run concurrently with other state highways. Along the routing, there are two river crossings and one railroad crossing. The current highway that bears the M-90 designation is the second to carry number. The first is now a section of M-69 in the Upper Peninsula. A section of current highway gained the number by 1927. Extensions of the highway further east resulted in the current routing by 1934. Route description M-90 starts at an intersection with M-24 in Deerfield Township in northern Lapeer County. The intersection is near the Lapeer State Game Area. After a short jog northeast to cross the Flint River, it runs due east on North Branch Road through rural farmland. The highway passed through North Branch on its way to M-53 in Burnside Township. There it turns south and runs concurrently with M-53 on Van Dyke Road for about before turning east on Burnside Road. M-90 continues east to pass through Brown City near the Sanilac County line. In Brown City, M-90 follows Main Street and crosses a branch of the Huron and Eastern Railway before it becomes Burns Line Road. South of Peck, M-90 turns north along M-19 on Brockway Road. M-90 once again turns east as a solo route on the east side of Peck and follows Peck Road. The trunkline crosses the Black River on the south side of Croswell before ending at M-25 near Lake Huron in Lexington. None of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. The traffic levels, as measured in terms of average annual daily traffic, a calculation of the average number of vehicles along a section of roadway for any given day, vary between 1,132 vehicles west of M-53 and 7,029 vehicles in Croswell. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) also computed the number of commercial vehicles in the 2009 survey and found that the highway was used by 120‚Äì163 commercial trucks each day on average. History =Previous designation= The first designation of M-90 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1, 1919. This highway started at M-45 (now M-95 south of Sagola and ran east to Foster City. It was replaced by M-69 by late 1927. =Current designation= M-90 in the Lower Peninsula replaced the M-38 designation between M-36 near North Branch and M-19 near Melvin. In 1930, when M-24 was extended north, M-90 was extended west to intersect the new highway north of Lapeer. The eastern end was extended in 1934 to US Highway 25 in Lexington.

Career Edwards began her broadcast career with a job at Radio Disney out of Dallas, Texas the fall after she graduated from high school. She interned for eight months before landing the more permanent jobs of writer, producer, voice actress and children's voice director. In July 1997, she became co-host of the Squeege and Kara Show on syndicated Radio Disney with friend and fellow voice actor Kyle Hebert.The Geek Fighters Interview. She did voice-over work in commercials for companies such as Blockbuster, Levi Strauss & Co. and Clinique. During the latter part of her Radio Disney tenure, Edwards voiced in a number of English-language versions of Japanese anime series for Funimation. Her most notable voice role as the child version of Goten and Videl in Dragon Ball Z. In March 2002, Edwards was hired as a producer and occasional \\"sidekick\\" for the Sander Walker in the Morning radio show on WSSS 104.7 FM in Charlotte, North Carolina. She stayed in this position until October 31, 2003. After that morning's airing finished, the entire Sander Walker show cast and crew were informed that WSSS was switching its format to Christmas music around the clock and subsequently were all terminated. Edwards was not off the airwaves for long, however. In February 2004, she became the co-host of the Jeff Roper Morning Show syndicated from WSOC 103.7 FM, also out of Charlotte. In January 2005, Jeff Roper left WSOC to take a morning job at WWNU 92 FM in Columbia, South Carolina. WSOC management assigned Edwards to take up co-hosting duties with Rob Tanner as part of the new Tanner in the Morning show. The show's mix of regional humor and parodies made it one of the higher-rated morning shows in the Charlotte area's country music radio market and Edwards continued her co-hosting duties for nearly two years. Although Edwards enjoyed her radio work, she began to feel strongly about voice acting. In August 2006, Edwards and fellow voice actors Sean Schemmel, Christopher Sabat, and Jason Liebrecht attended the Wizard World Comics Convention in Chicago, Illinois. When Dragon Ball fans waited in line up to five hours to get her autograph, Edwards began seriously considering making voice acting her full-time job. A few weeks later, Edwards brought her feelings to WSOC management during a monthly performance strategy meeting and told them of her desire to go into voice acting full-time and leave her position as co-host. WSOC and the Tanner show staff accepted Edwards's decision and her departure was handled amicably. Since then, Edwards has resided in Dallas doing commercial and documentary voice-over, but occasionally returns to Funimation to reprise her Dragon Ball roles and other anime.Kara Edwards Voice Over Talent, young, real, animation .

The group of local Catholic intellectuals, known as Serb- Catholics (–°—Ä–±–∏ –∫–∞—Ç–æ–ª–∏—Ü–∏ / Srbi katolici) or Catholic Serbs (–∫–∞—Ç–æ–ª–∏—á–∫–∏ –°—Ä–±–∏ / katoliƒçki Srbi), espoused strong pro-Serbian sentiments against the Austrian occupation since 1815. The most prominent incarnations of the movement were the early pan-Slavic phase under Matija Ban and Medo Puciƒá, and more Serbian nationalists phase active between the 1880s and 1908, led by a large number of Dubrovnik intellectuals at the time. Background Before the 19th century, it is difficult to ascertain the precise number of residents in Dubrovnik who self-identified as Serbs. Prior to the twentieth century, Dubrovnik had never been ruled over by a Slavic nation, although it did have close trade and political ties with medieval Serbian states. In the early Middle Ages, Dubrovnik lay at a crossroads between the Balkan regions inhabited by the Croat and Serb tribes. Most sources from the later medieval and early modern period simply refer to Dubrovnik's Slavic inhabitants generically as \\"Slav\\" and their language as \\"Slavic.\\" With the increased emphasis on ethnic distinction in the nineteenth century, there are increased references to \\"Serbs\\" and \\"Croats\\" as distinct peoples of Dubrovnik. The Republic of Ragusa enforced a single state religion of Roman Catholicism, while Orthodoxy was given equal status with Catholicism only in 1848, by which time there were hundreds of Orthodox immigrants from Herzegovina in the city who maintained their religious affiliation with the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Eparch of Dalmatia Josif Rajaƒçiƒá dispatched the first Orthodox priest to Dubrovnik, ƒêorƒëe Nikolajeviƒá, in 1833. History The cultural and political movement of Serbs in Dubrovnik was started around this time, notably by Nikolajeviƒá's 1838 article in the newspaper Srbsko-Dalmatinski Magazin (published in Zadar by Bo≈æidar Petranoviƒá), where he claimed the entire Ragusan Slavonic literary corpus for Serbian literature. In 1841, Medo Puciƒá, a writer from an old Catholic noble family, became acquainted with pan-Slavists J√°n Koll√°r and Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik, and started to espouse a Serb national sentiment. Matija Ban, another Catholic from Dubrovnik, was influenced by pan-Slavists and romantic nationalists Micha≈Ç Czajkowski and Franti≈°ek Zach in Istanbul, so much that he moved to Belgrade in 1844 in an attempt to promote his idea that Serbian patriotism must extend beyond Serbian Orthodoxy and the borders of the Principality of Serbia. In Serbia, Ban's group of enthusiasts worked with Serbia's minister of the interior Ilija Gara≈°anin, the author of Naƒçertanije, to enter the upper reaches of Serbian political life. They were not, however, met with uniform acceptance - Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá and others, with support of the Church in Serbia, protested against their ideas and by extension against Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's notion that Serbian language and nationality extended beyond Orthodoxy. Serb sports society Du≈°an the Mighty with Dr.Mato Graciƒá in the center, Dubrovnik, 1910 During the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas (1848-1849), the Serbian government was involved on the side of the South Slavs in Serbian Vojvodina, and at the same time Matija Ban traveled to Croatian lands and advocated for pan-Slavic as well as pro-Serbian ideas, claiming the Kingdom of Dalmatia should be unified with the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, but also describing the language of Dubrovnik as Serbian. By 1850, the revolution was over and Ban, particularly because he had acquired Serbian citizenship in 1844, became suspicious to the Austrian police in Dubrovnik, who started to monitor him. At that point, he was summoned to Belgrade where Gara≈°anin suspended all of his operations and ordered him to permanently return to Belgrade. He hesitated, but was persuaded by Prince Aleksandar and others to comply. He did however leave his family in Dubrovnik and published two more issues of the journal Dubrovnik in Ljudevit Gaj's publishing house in Zagreb in 1851 and 1852. Three decades later, in the 1880s a sizable group of Ragusan intellectuals independently developed a Serb- Catholic feeling, but at that point it was a political movement that was openly hostile to the Croats and whose leaders cooperated with the pro-Italian Autonomist Party (i.e. it was not pan-Slavic). Following the 1878 Congress of Berlin, the Habsburg Empire occupied Bosnia and created the Austro-Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which prompted a confrontation between the Serb and Croat national ideologies, and the new \\"Serb-Catholic\\" circle of Dubrovnik increasingly broke with the pan-Slavic tradition of its founders, Puciƒá and Ban. The same year, Serbia obtained independence. In the preparation for the Imperial Council election of 1879, the Serb Party of Dalmatia severed ties with the People's Party, which marked a significant shift in Dalmatian politics at the time. Subsequently, in 1890, a coalition of the Autonomist Party and the Serb Party won the municipal election in Dubrovnik, where the Autonomists were considered to be \\"Serb-Catholics\\". In the elections of 1899, local Croats saw their big mistake and a coalition of the People's Croatian Party (from 1899 new name of the People's Party in Dalmatia) and the Party of Rights came into power. Literature of Dubrovnik, published by the Serb Academic Youth of Dubrovnik (1900). In 1904/1905, a cultural society \\"Croatian and Serbian People's Home\\" from Cavtat (south of Dubrovnik) promulgated pan- Slavic ideas.Narodna zastava ujedinjenih Srba i Hrvata, Dubrovnik 1905 In 1908 (Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) all Serbian unions, clubs and newspapers in the city were closed and forbidden by Austrian authorities, which led to massive emigration of Serbian-oriented high society from the city of Dubrovnik. Matica Srpska of Dubrovnik was founded in 1909 by the last will of Serbian businessman Konstantin Vuƒçkoviƒá. Legacy After World War I, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia those Serbs who were left in Dubrovnik opted for the Yugoslav national unity, in contrast to Croats in the city who opted for the preserving of autonomous status of Croatia in Yugoslavia and unification of Dalmatia with Croatia-Slavonia. In 1939 Dubrovnik with its district became part of Banovina of Croatia which was established the same year. Those circumstances intensified emigration. During the Independent State of Croatia (1941-1945), the city completely reoriented itself to Croatian culture. In a personal correspondence with author and critic dr. Milan ≈†eviƒá in 1932, Murat complained that Orthodox Serbs are not acknowledging the Catholic Serb community on the basis of their faith. In recent times, the prominence of the 19th century Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik was misused by proponents of the idea of Greater Serbia. Today, Serbs in Dubrovnik make up 2.73% of the town's population according to the 2011 census.

The film generally opposes the patenting of living organisms, and describes the disappearance of traditional cultural practices. It also criticizes the cost of a globalized food industry on human lives around the world. It states that international companies are gradually driving farmers off their land in many countries, that monoculture farming might lead to global dependence of the human race on food corporations, and that there is an increased risk of ecological disasters caused by a reduction of biological diversity. For example, the local varieties of Mexican corn are being replaced by subsidized US corn. The film also describes a fear of major losses to local food systems and states that these gene banks will no longer be available to save global industrial agriculture when a new pest arises, and that if they spread to plants in the wild, terminator genes could lead to a widespread catastrophe affecting the food supply. Legal stories reported by the film related how a number of farmers in North America have been sued by the Monsanto Company.  Cast  ;interviewees: * Dr. Charles M.

It has since been released on DVD in both NTSC and PAL formats. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has score of 81% based on reviews from 26 critics. The websites consensus states: \\"The Future of Food is a one-sided, but revelatory documentary about the dangers of genetically modified food.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe made a tongue-in-cheek comparison to the horror genre by writing \\"Anyone looking for a more practical horror film than The Fog should try The Future of Food, a new documentary about the slippery slope of genetic modification in agriculture\\", and shared that in 1998 Monsanto publicly abrogated any responsibility for ensuring the long-term safety of their GMO products and passed that responsibility to the Food and Drug Administration. Variety wrote that the film \\"is a disturbing‚Äîif somewhat bland and partisan‚Äîstudy of agribusiness' aggressive push for genetically-modified food,\\" and expressed \\"it's a shame writer-director Deborah Koons Garcia opts to show only one side of the argument\\". They also felt that seen as \\"a rallying cry for organic and slow-food fans everywhere\\", the film would find a large audience \\"in public interest tube play and activist vid circulation.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film a \\"sober, far-reaching polemic against genetically modified foods\\" with its good guys and bad guys clearly identified. The Georgia Straight speaks toward Deborah Koons Garcia advocacy and her opposition to the genetic engineering done by Monsanto. While noting the film's beginning awkwardly with Koons-Garcia's pointing the finger of shame at the political motivation of Monsanto, they concluded it \\"gets slightly more hopeful as it goes along\\". San Francisco Chronicle wrote the filmmaker \\"has taken a complex subject and made it digestible for anyone who cares about what they put into their stomachs,\\" but also noted that \\"Monsanto will attack Garcia's documentary as a piece of unbalanced journalism\\". Victoria Gilman of Chemical & Engineering News criticized the lack of balance in the film, noting that Garcia defended farmers being deprived of the ability to raise non-GMO canola oil despite canola oil itself being a creation of a sort of \\"genetic engineering\\" (not to be confused with GM technologies) using the science at the time. New York Post called the film \\"enlightening\\", noting it \\"takes dead aim at genetically altered food, [by] arguing that grocery shelves are filled with potentially dangerous items.\\" New York Daily Newsgave the film 3 stars and spoke toward the film's tone, writing \\"Garcia's somber narration is a turnoff, but this plucky little diatribe gets you thinking about the larger implications facing future generations\\". The Hollywood Reporter wrote the film \\"is a powerful, if one-sided, attack on the GM food industry,\\" because the filmmaker \\"builds a strong case against GM food and its producers\\", but a \\"major weakness is that the GM producers are not given time to explain their side of the story.\\" Seattle Times noted that the film used \\"every propagandist trick in the book\\", supported by \\"foreboding background music\\", and a \\"relentlessly downbeat tone and gloom-and-doom hand-wringing over the way corporate greed is poisoning the globe\\" to force their point across, and wrote \\"Most of us have some awareness about the debate over genetically engineered food. But it‚Äôs a good bet that far fewer people know how insidious these possibly dangerous man-made organisms have become as their invasion into the world‚Äôs food supply grows\\". The Denver Post referred to the film as a \\"propaganda documentary\\", and commented that while the film's concept had great possibilities with hopes that it would \\"become a worthy champion of the little guy\\" in its covering of Percy Schmeiser's battle with Monsanto, the film failed because \\"filmmaker Deborah Koons Garcia isn't much of a journalist\\" and she \\"strays from this fascinating case to a generalized attack on biotechnology and corporate farming\\", through using \\"loose accusations and emotionally dishonest footage to argue her cause\\". =Awards and nominations= * 2005, won WFCC award as 'Best Documentary: Above and Beyond' by Women Film Critics Circle * 2005, won Audience Award as 'Best Documentary Film' at Ashland Independent Film Festival See also * Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life * Deconstructing Dinner * The Jungle * A Place at the Table * Food, Inc.

Abortion  Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution says, in part, \\"Section 12. The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.\\" The act is criminalized by Philippine law. Articles 256, 258 and 259 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines mandate imprisonment for women who undergo abortion, as well as for any person who assists in the procedure. Article 258 further imposes a higher prison term on the woman or her parents if the abortion is undertaken \\"in order to conceal [the woman's] dishonor\\". There is no law in the Philippines that expressly authorizes abortions in order to save the woman's life; and the general provisions which do penalize abortion make no qualifications if the woman's life is endangered. It may be argued that an abortion to save the mother's life could be classified as a justifying circumstance (duress as opposed to self-defense) that would bar criminal prosecution under the Revised Penal Code. However, this has yet to be adjudicated by the Philippine Supreme Court. Proposals to liberalize Philippine abortion laws have been opposed by the Catholic Church, and its opposition has considerable influence in the predominantly Catholic country. However, the constitutionality of abortion restrictions has yet to be challenged before the Philippine Supreme Court. The constitutional provision that \\"[The State] shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception\\" was crafted by the Constitutional Commission which drafted the charter with the intention of providing for constitutional protection of the abortion ban, although the enactment of a more definitive provision sanctioning the ban was not successful. The provision is enumerated among several state policies, which are generally regarded in law as unenforceable in the absence of implementing legislation. The 1987 Constitution also contains several other provisions enumerating various state policies.These provisions include, e.g., the affirmation of labor \\"as a primary social economic force\\" (Section 14, Article II); the equal protection of \\"the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception\\" (Section 12, Article II); the \\"Filipino family as the foundation of the nation\\" (Article XV, Section 1); the recognition of Filipino as \\"the national language of the Philippines\\" (Section 6, Article XVI), and even a requirement that \\"all educational institutions shall undertake regular sports activities throughout the country in cooperation with athletic clubs and other sectors\\" (Section 19.1, Article XIV). Whether these provisions may, by themselves, be the source of enforceable rights without implementing legislation has been the subject of considerable debate in the legal sphere and within the Supreme Court.The Court, for example, has ruled that a provision requiring that the State \\"guarantee equal access to opportunities to public service\\" could not be enforced without implementing legislation, and thus could not bar the disallowance of so-called \\"nuisance candidates\\" in presidential elections. However, in another case the Court held that a provision requiring that the State \\"protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology\\" did not require implementing legislation to become the source of operative rights. Any legal challenge to abortion restrictions in the Philippines would necessarily have to evaluate the legal force given to Section 12, Article II of the Constitution. An analysis by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs concluded that although the Revised Penal Code does not list specific exceptions to the general prohibition on abortion, under the general criminal law principles of necessity as set forth in article 11(4) of the Code, an abortion may be legally performed to save the pregnant woman's life.\\"Philippines: Abortion Policy\\" , part of World Abortion Policies 2007 , United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.  Abortion incidence  A 1997 study estimated that, despite legal restrictions, in 1994 there were 400,000 abortions performed illegally in the Philippines and 80,000 hospitalizations of women for abortion-related complications; It was reported in 2005 that official estimates then ranged from 400,000 to 500,000 and rising, and that the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate was 800,000. Seventy percent of unwanted pregnancies in the Philippines end in abortion, according to the WHO. Approximately 4 in 5 abortions in the Philippines are for economic reasons, often where a woman already has several children and cannot care for another. While some doctors secretly perform abortions in clinics, the 2,000 to 5,000 peso (US$37 to US$93) fee is too high for many Filipinos, so they instead buy abortifacients on the black market, e.g. from vendors near churches, sari-sari stores and bakeries. Two-thirds of Filipino women who have abortions attempt to self- induce or seek solutions from those who practice folk medicine.Juarez, Fatima, Cabigon, Josefina, Singh, Susheela, & Hussain, Rubina (2005). \\"The Incidence of Induced Abortion in the Philippines: Current Level and Recent Trends\\" . International Family Planning Perspectives, 31 (3). Retrieved November 11, 2006. One hundred thousand people end up in the hospital every year due to unsafe abortions, according to the Department of Health, and 12% of all maternal deaths in 1994 were due to unsafe abortion. Some hospitals refuse to treat complications of unsafe abortion, or operate without anesthesia, as punishment for the patients. In 2000, the Department of Health expanded a 1998 policy called Prevention and Management of Abortion and Its Complications (PMAC) aimed at addressing the complications of unsafe abortion to improve availability of quality of humane post-abortion care services by competent, compassionale, objective and non-judgmental service providers in well-equipped institutions complimented by a supportive environment.

The , right-hander was signed by the New York Giants as an amateur free agent before the 1944 season. He played for the Cincinnati Redlegs (1954‚Äì57), Los Angeles Dodgers (1959), and Los Angeles Angels (1961‚Äì64), and went on to be associated with manager Billy Martin as a coach with five major league teams, including four stops with the New York Yankees. Career Fowler was born in Converse, South Carolina. His brother Jesse pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals. Jesse was nearly 24 years older than Art, and the Fowlers hold the record for the largest age difference between brothers who played Major League baseball. Art Fowler pitched 10 years in the minor leagues with a record of 140‚Äì94. He led Southern Association pitchers in games pitched (54), innings pitched (261), hits allowed (273), and ERA (3.03) while playing for the Atlanta Crackers in 1953, and led Carolina League pitchers with 23 wins while playing for the Danville Leafs in 1945. Finally reaching the major leagues at the age of 31, Fowler made his major league debut in relief on April 17, 1954 against the Milwaukee Braves at Milwaukee County Stadium. His first big league win came in his first start, a 3‚Äì2 victory over the Chicago Cubs on April 25 at Crosley Field. He had a good rookie season, finishing 12‚Äì10 with a 3.83 earned run average. He ranked ninth in the National League with 227 innings pitched. In 1955 and 1956, his last years as a regular starter, he combined for a 22‚Äì21 record with an ERA of 3.97. He started seven games for Cincinnati in 1957, and then appeared almost exclusively in relief thereafter. After a poor year with the Dodgers in 1959, Fowler resurfaced in the major leagues in 1961 at age 38 with the expansion Los Angeles Angels. He, along with Tom Morgan, and later Jack Spring and Julio Navarro, were the Angels' most reliable pitchers out of the bullpen during their first three seasons. Fowler's combined record from 1961 to 1963 was 14‚Äì14 with 26 saves and a 2.96 ERA in 158 games. He was released by the Angels on May 15, 1964 at age 41, the oldest player to appear in an American League game that season. His major league career totals include a 54‚Äì51 record in 362 games pitched, 90 games started, 25 complete games, 4 shutouts, 134 games finished, 32 saves, and an ERA of 4.03.Goldstein Richard, Art Fowler, 84, Who Coached for Yankees Again and Again, Is Dead, New York Times, January 30 2007.Art Fowler, 84; Dodgers, Angels pitcher became Yankees coach, Los Angeles Times, January 30 2007.

She acted in quite a few Hindi and Bengali films. Personal life Tista was diagnosed with gender identity disorder (GID) at an early stage of life and consequently underwent sex reassignment surgery under Dr. Sheila Rohatgi, a prominent plastic surgeon from Kolkata who specializes in SRS procedures. Following this Tista went public with her identity and was a source of much controversy and social upheaval regarding stereotypes associated with the transsexual community. Her case played a pivotal role in changing the misconceptions in Indian society about transsexuality and went on to provoke a positive national debate in the press and the media on the ethics of sex change and transsexual rights in India. A social activist in transsexual issues and a vocal proponent of transsexual rights, Tista is also a prominent actress with a string of film and television soap appearances to her credit. Tista is regarded by many as an icon of empowerment and choice for the transsexual community in India.

In Hrisikesh Mondal's docu-feature Achena Bondhutto Tista played as a Psychological counselor. Her role in Achena Bondhutto is about the battle to gain acceptance and convince people that the Transgender community has many more things to do than clapping hands and exposing offences.

Receiving little support, he then resorted to armed insurrection (the Saga Rebellion), gathering some 3000 followers, attacking a local bank for funds, and capturing government offices. The revolt was quickly suppressed by government forces under ≈åkubo Toshimichi, and Et≈ç, along with 13 other ringleaders, was executed. Then their heads were displayed in public.

It links both Camp Grayling and Hartwick Pines State Park with Interstate 75 (I-75). Both termini of M-93 end at locations, rather than junctions with another road. The western end of M-93 ends in a traffic circle before it turns into Howe Road as it travels through Camp Grayling. The highway dates back to 1919 as a connection with the predecessor to Camp Grayling. Since that time, it has been extended through Grayling along first US Highway 27 (US 27) and now Business Loop I-75 (BL 75) to connect with the state park. Route description M-93 starts at the main gate of Camp Grayling. From there it runs north and east along Sharon Road parallel to the shore of Lake Margarethe through the edge of the base complex. The highway continues through forested terrain to a junction with M-72 west of the city of Grayling. M-93 turns east, running concurrently along M-72 into town. As the highway approaches downtown, the landscape becomes more urbanized after crossing the Au Sable River. In Grayling, M-93 turns north along the former route of US 27, which is now BL I-75. M-72 turns south with BL I-75 along James Street, ending the M-72/M-93 concurrency. The roadway runs north through town passing the Grayling Army Airfield, and BL I-75/M-93 becomes Grayling Highway. Together they make a right turn onto Hartwick Pines Road when they intersect Old 27 Road, turning back towards I-75; this area is part of the Grayling State Forest. The BL I-75 designation ends at I-75 while M-93 continues along Hartwick Pines Road. The M-93 designation ends at the park's former main gate. The roadway continues further into Hartwick Pines State Park as White Road, a rural road that intersects unsigned route County Road 612 north of the park boundaries. History On July 1, 1919, M-93 was a spur routing from M-18 to the \\"State Military Camp\\", what is now Camp Grayling. The designation was extended in 1929 along North Down River Road, and several back roads to Bob Cat Trail and Hartwick Pines State Park. A new routing was completed in 1932 north of downtown Grayling to the park. The highway extended north of the park to County Road 612 east of Frederick at this time as well. When I-75 was completed in the area in 1963, the US 27 designation was dropped, and BL I-75 was designated through town in its place. The northern end was truncated to the state park in 1968. When the park's entrance was moved in the early 1990s, the highway designation was not truncated again, and MDOT still maintains M-93 to the former park entrance at Bob Cat Trail.

When parties agree to a mediation process, they then have the power vested in them to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute. The mediator has power over the process, but not the outcome. The mediator should be impartial and have no influence or control over the outcome. The mediation is an endeavour by the parties to reach an agreement, usually to avoid, or in preference to a court based processes. Neutrality of the process The success of mediation as a \\"win/win\\" alternative dispute resolution method is most often attributed to its qualities as a consensual, voluntary and fair process. Therefore mediation is framed as a process which is neutral and procedurally fair, designed to increase party participation and self- determination through decision-making and to create a mutually acceptable outcome. Katsh, E. & Wing, L. p.14, 2006 The expectation is for all parties to participate in the mediation process. However, because the participation of the parties and the mediator is voluntary, the parties and or the mediator have the freedom to leave the process at any time. Refusal to participate Procedural fairness could become an issue in an employment dispute where a worker refuses to participate in a mediation process, especially if a dismissal was the end result. In the instance of legitimate reasons for absence, such as ill health, a representative may be nominated to act in that party's best interests. Parties are expected to act in a civil and courteous manner, to act in a positive way and be prepared to be flexible in order to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Mediators are expected to facilitate constructive participation by the parties. Party participation is an important indicator since mediation is a voluntary decision and cannot progress without all the parties‚Äô agreement to participatory commitment.

Science fiction writing Born in Colac, Victoria, and an enthusiastic fan of science fiction, Harding was among the founding members of the Melbourne Science Fiction Club. Other members of the club were Race Mathews, Bertram Chandler, Bob McCubbin, Merv Binns and Dick Jenssen. Harding's first published work appeared in the Sydney photographic magazine PHOTO DIGEST in 1958: a photographic coverage of the filming of Nevil Shute's novel ON THE BEACH in Melbourne and Frankston locations, accompanied by a personal written record of his adventures there. This led to a request for a regular monthly column for the magazine on 35mm photography, and a subsequent photographic and written coverage of the filming of THE SUNDOWNERS, in Cooma, NSW. In 1961 Harding's first published short story, Displaced Person, was published in Science Fantasy. He continued to write and submit stories to a range of magazines, including New Worlds, Science Fantasy, and Science Fiction Adventures in the U.K. In 1966, John Bangsund started the Australian SF Review (ASFR) and he and Harding and John Foyster became editorial partners in producing this fanzine publication. In 1969 Harding then went on to write for the joint Australian/UK SF magazine Vision of Tomorrow, set up by Ron Graham, plus stories in U.S magazines Galaxy, If and Odyssey, and also Australian magazines, including the Melbourne SUN newspaper. These stories were widely translated and dramatised. He also wrote two 12 part science fiction serials for ABC Education Radio and dramatised an H.G. Wells story for the same programme. From 1972 Harding switched from photography to writing full-time. He published four short PB novels in Cassel's (aust.) education series for reluctant readers : The Fallen Spaceman, Children of Atlantis, The Frozen Sky & Return to Tomorrow. The success of this series was beyond expectations: the time was right to introduce the genre more widely in Australia. His first adult novel, A WORLD OF SHADOWS, followed in 1976 (Robert Hale, London) and in the same year he edited the seminal Australian SF anthologies BEYOND TOMORROW and THE ALTERED I, with assistance from Rob Gerrand and Ursula K. Le Guin, and followed this with ROOMS OF PARADISE in 1978, which was also published in the U.S. and U.K. Several stories from the latter were also re-printed in the annual U.S. publication, THE YEAR'S BEST SF. Four SF novels followed, culminating in the ground-breaking classic DISPLACED PERSON, adapted from his earlier short story, and his winning the Children's Book of The Year Award in 1980 accelerated the acceptance of the \\"young adult\\" genre to Australian fiction. With HEARTSEASE, he finally moved away from science fiction with his first mainstream novel, also for the young adult market. Harding has also written short stories using the pseudonym, Harold G Nye.

One of the popular catabiotic theories is the entropy theory of aging, where aging is characterized by thermodynamically favourable increase in structural disorder. Living organisms are open systems that take free energy from the environment and offload their entropy as waste. However, basic components of living systems‚ÄîDNA, proteins, lipids and sugars‚Äîtend towards the state of maximum entropy while continuously accumulating damages causing catabiosis of the living structure.

In this map, Puncak Trikora is indicated, though Puncak Mandala is widely recognised as the taller summit. The Seven Second Summits are the second-highest mountains of each of the seven continents. All of these mountain peaks are separate peaks rather than a sub- peak of the continents' high point. The Seven Second Summits are considered by many mountaineers and geographers as a much harder challenge than the traditional Seven Summits. Austrian mountaineer Christian Stangl became the first person to successfully climb the Second Seven Summits. Stangl climbed all possible candidates for the Second Seven Summits quest (K2, Mt. Logan, Ojos del Salado, Batian, Mt. Tyree, Dych Tau, Dufourspitze, Sumantri, Ngga Pulu, Puncak Trikora, Puncak Mandala and Mt. Townsend) to exclude any errors and to satisfy all geographers. He finished the quest on 15 January 2013 and was certified by Guinness World Records on 17 September 2013. Later, he also completed the Challenge for the Seven Third Summits.British Mountaineering Council: Christian Stangl completes the Triple Seven Summits (english)skyrunning.at: Three records for Austrian Alpinist Christian Stangl (english)climbing.com: Stangl Completes Triple Seven Summits by Dougald MacDonald, Climbing (USA) 8/28/13 In 2012 the Italian mountaineer Hans Kammerlander claimed to be the first person to complete the Seven Second Summits, but doubts were raised about his ascent of Mount Logan. Kammerlander also climbed Puncak Trikora, which is now believed to be slightly lower than Puncak Mandala.  Seven Second Summits definitions The definition of what constitutes a continent is a matter of some dispute among mountaineers seeking to complete this challenge. The main ridge of the Greater Caucasus range is generally considered to form the boundary between Europe and Asia. In that case, Mount Elbrus, () situated some 10 km north of the continental divide, is the highest mountain in Europe. Excluding the Caucasus Mountains, Mont Blanc () would be Europe's highest mountain. The Australian continent is defined as comprising the mainland of Australia and proximate islands on the same continental shelf, including Tasmania and New Guinea. In the convention of the seven continents, one of the continents is the region of Australasia, which includes, for example, the mountainous islands of New Zealand. For both the geological and conventional continent, New Guinea's Carstensz Pyramid () is the highest summit. When considering a continent as a continuous landmass surrounded by oceans, mainland Australia would be its own continent, with Mount Kosciuszko () as its highest summit. =The Bass and Messner lists= The Seven Second Summits list follows the Seven Summits list created by Richard Bass, who chose the highest mountain of mainland Australia, Mount Kosciuszko (2,228 m), to represent the Australian continent's highest summit. Reinhold Messner proposed another list (the Messner or Carstensz list), replacing Mount Kosciuszko with Western New Guinea's Carstensz Pyramid, which is part of Indonesia (4,884 m). Following the Bass list, Mount Townsend is the second-highest summit (2,209 m) in Australia. According to the Messner list, Puncak Mandala (4,760 m) on New Guinea is the second highest of the Australian continent.See for example the lists at peaklist, peakbagger.com, and gunungbagging.comSeveral other summits of Mount Carstensz besides Carstensz Pyramid, like Ngga Pulu (4,862 m) and Carstensz East (4,820 or 4,840 m) are higher than both Mandala and Trikora, but because of their low prominence (200‚Äì300 m) and isolation (2.2‚Äì2.6 km) these are usually not regarded as separate mountains. Heights of mountain peaks in West Papua are poorly established, and Puncak Trikora has been listed as the second-highest summit on the island, but SRTM data do support a higher elevation for Mandala. Both lists count Mount Elbrus as the highest peak in Europe. This makes Dykh-Tau (5,205 m), located in Russia, the second-highest summit in Europe. Those who consider Mont Blanc to be the highest mountain in Europe would consider Monte Rosa (4,634 m), located in Switzerland, to be the second-highest summit. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !colspan=\\"8\\"Seven Second Summits (sorted by elevation) - ! width= 100  Peak ! width= 50  Bass list ! width= 50  Messner list ! width= 100  Elevation ! width= 100  Prominence ! width= 100  Continent ! width= 100  Range ! width= 100  Country -align=center K2 align=center‚úî align=center‚úî align=center align=center Asia Karakoram Pakistan / China -align=center Ojos del Salado align=center‚úî align=center‚úî align=center align=center South America Andes Argentina / Chile -align=center Mount Logan align=center‚úî align=center‚úî align=center align=center North America Saint Elias Canada -align=center Dykh-Tau align=center‚úî align=center‚úî align=center align=center Europe Caucasus Russia -align=center Mount Kenya align=center‚úî align=center‚úî align=center align=center Africa  ‚Äì Kenya -align=center Mount Tyree align=center‚úî align=center‚úî align=center align=center Antarctica Sentinel  ‚Äì -align=center Puncak Mandala align=center align=center‚úî align=center align=center Australia (continent) Jayawijaya Indonesia -align=center Mount Townsend align=center‚úî align=center align=center align=center Australia Snowies Australia }  Difficulty versus Seven Summits  The presentation of the Second Seven Summits concept and its relative difficulty was first published in January 1997 by Rock and Ice Magazine (#77) in the article The Second Seven Summits written by mountaineer and writer David D. Keaton. Later that year, the author Jon Krakauer in his book Into Thin Air echoed those sentiments by writing that it would be a bigger challenge to climb the second- highest peak of each continent instead of the highest. In the climbing community, mountaineers such as Rob Hall had previously discussed the idea. In Asia, K2 () demands greater technical climbing skills than Everest (), while altitude-related factors such as the thinness of the atmosphere, high winds, and low temperatures remain much the same. In Africa, the summit of Mount Kenya () is a rock climb, while Mount Kilimanjaro () can be ascended without any technical difficulty. In North America, some sources consider Mount Logan a more difficult climb than Denali, although the climbing and outdoor recreation website Summitpost considers Logan no more difficult than Denali because it is neither technical nor steep. Mountaineer Mark Horrell, in a 2012 post on his blog, considered Mount Logan to be no more difficult technically than Denali, but much more difficult to approach. Denali's base camp, at elevation, is regularly served by air, while climbers without the means to charter a plane face must tow their supplies by sledge for over to reach Mount Logan. In South America, Ojos del Salado involves a short scramble while Aconcagua is just a walk.John Biggar: The Andes ‚Äì A Guide for Climbers, Horrell acknowledged that Ojos del Salado was more technically difficult, but considered Aconcagua a greater challenge because of physical demands. Aconcagua's base camp, at , is accessible by mule, but from that point on, climbers must carry all of their supplies to as many as three higher camps before the final ascent. By contrast, Ojos del Salado is accessible by four- wheel-drive vehicles up to ; from that point on, climbers need only carry supplies to a mountain hut at before making their final push to the summit. In Europe, Dykh-Tau is a considerably harder climb than Mount Elbrus.Bender: Classic Climbs of the Caucasus According to Horrell, the main route on Elbrus is \\"long and physically tiring, but it‚Äôs not technically difficult,\\" while Dykh-Tau's \\"easiest is graded at Russian alpine 4B, which involves steep rock sections and 55 degree snow and ice slopes.\\" In Australasia, the continent's Second Summit on the Bass list, Mount Townsend, is more challenging than Mount Kosciuszko, but still just a walk-up.Geehi Bushwalking Club: Snowy Mountains Walks The normal route on the highest peak of the Messner list, Carstensz Pyramid, is technically difficult (UIAA grade V+). Puncak Mandala, however, is extremely challenging with respect to the approach route, which is arguably the more significant problem in climbing the New Guinea peaks. There have been perhaps only two successful approaches (and climbs) reported.Puncak Mandala at the gunung bagging website In Antarctica, Mount Vinson presents little difficulty beyond normal challenges of Antarctica (the guiding company Adventure Peaks rates the ascent at PD/AD on the Alpine scale), but Mount Tyree requires technical climbing, and it has been climbed by a total of fifteen people since its discovery.

It pitted the British South Africa Company against the Ndebele (Matabele) Kingdom. Lobengula, king of the Ndebele, had tried to avoid outright war with the company's pioneers because he and his advisors were mindful of the destructive power of European-produced weapons on traditional Matabele impis (units of warriors) attacking in massed ranks. Lobengula reportedly could muster 80,000 spearmen and 20,000 riflemen, armed with Martini-Henry rifles, which were modern arms at that time. However, poor training meant that these were not used effectively. The British South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company's Police, with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana (Bechuana) allies. Cecil Rhodes, who was Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and Leander Starr Jameson, the Administrator of Mashonaland also tried to avoid war to prevent loss of confidence in the future of the territory. Matters came to a head when Lobengula approved a raid to forcibly extract tribute from a Mashona chief in the district of the town of Fort Victoria, which inevitably led to a clash with the Company.  Events leading to war  An inhabitant of Bulawayo, pictured in 1890 The British government agreed that the British South Africa Company would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to the Zambezi under royal charter. Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889. Cecil Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Company's Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare). Throughout 1891 and 1892, Lobengula ensured that his raiding parties were directed away from their main target areas of Mashonaland and so precluded possible clashes between his zealous young commanders and the white settlers. However, in 1893, a chief in the Victoria district named Gomara refused tribute, asserting that he was now under the protection of the laws of the settlers. In order to save face, Lobengula was impelled to send a raiding party of several thousand warriors to bring his vassal to heel. The raiding party destroyed several villages and murdered many of the inhabitants. (In this they were more restrained than usual as they generally abducted the suitably aged young men and women and killed everyone else.) However, the local British South Africa Company administration felt that they had to intervene to avoid losing the confidence of the local people who complained that they were not being given any support against the raid. As a result the Company officials demanded from the raiders that they leave immediately. The Ndebele refused and in the hostilities that developed the Ndebele sustained about 40 casualties; this led to their withdrawal. King Lobengula had given stern warning to his fighters when they started the raid. \\"If you shed one drop of the white man's blood on this raid into Mashonaland, I will have every one of you killed when you return\\".  Start of the war  There was a delay of just over two months (August to October) while Jameson corresponded with Rhodes in Cape Town and considered how to amass enough troops to undertake an invasion of Matabeleland. BSAP columns rode from Fort Salisbury and Fort Victoria, and combined at Iron Mine Hill, around the centre point of the country, on 16 October 1893. Together the force totalled about 700 men, commanded by Major Patrick Forbes and equipped with five Maxim machine guns. Forbes' combined column moved on the Matabele king's capital at Bulawayo, to the south-west. An additional force of 700 Bechuanas marched on Bulawayo from the south under Khama III, the most influential of the Bamangwato chiefs, and a staunch ally of the British. The Matabele army mobilised to prevent Forbes from reaching the city, and twice engaged the column as it approached: on 25 October, 3,500 warriors assaulted the column near the Shangani River. Lobengula's troops were well-drilled and formidable by pre-colonial African standards, but the pioneers' Maxim guns, which had never before been used in battle, far exceeded expectations, according to an eyewitness \\"mow[ing] them down literally like grass\\". By the time the Matabele withdrew, they had suffered around 1,500 fatalities; the BSAP, on the other hand, had lost only four men. A week later, on 1 November, 2,000 Matabele riflemen and 4,000 warriors attacked Forbes at Bembesi, about north-east of Bulawayo, but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major's Maxims: about 2,500 more Matabele were killed. Lobengula fled Bulawayo as soon as he heard the news from Bembesi; in keeping with traditional custom, he and his subjects torched the royal town as they went. In the resultant conflagration, the city's large store of ivory, gold and other treasure was destroyed, and its ammunition magazine exploded. The flames were still rising when the British marched into the settlement the next day; they set up base in the \\"White Man's Camp\\" already present, and nailed the company flag and the Union Jack to a tree. The reconstruction of Bulawayo began almost as soon as the fires were out, with a new Company-run city rising atop the ruins of Lobengula's former residence.  Destruction of Bulawayo  The column of Khama's men from the south had reached the Tati River, and won a victory on the Singuesi river on 2 November. Advanced scouts for the colonial forces, including Burnham and Selous, reached Bulawayo that same day, only to watch as Lobengula blew up his arsenal of ammunition rather than allow it to be captured by the company. The town, mostly made up of wood-beam huts with mud (dagga) walls, was largely destroyed. On 3 November, Bulawayo was reached by the Victoria column from Mashonaland, accompanied by Jameson and Sir John Willoughby. By this time, Lobengula and his warriors were in full flight towards the Zambezi. An attempt was made to induce Lobengula to surrender, but no replies were received to the messages. The United Salisbury Column later arrived in Bulawayo, and on 13 November, Major Patrick Forbes organized his column and started in pursuit of Lobengula.  Shangani Patrol  The pursuing party was delayed by difficult routes and heavy rains, and did not catch up with Lobengula until December 3. Major Allan Wilson, in command of thirty-four troopers known as the Shangani Patrol, crossed the Shangani river and bivouacked close to Lobengula's quarters. In the night the river rose, and early the next morning the Matabele surrounded the Shangani Patrol, overwhelming Wilson and his followers. 31 men of the Shangani Patrol perished in the encounter, while the remaining three (American scouts Frederick Russell Burnham and Pearl \\"Pete\\" Ingram, and an Australian named Gooding) crossed the swollen river under orders from Wilson, and returned to Forbes to request reinforcements. However, Forbes' forces were unable to cross the river in time. Defeat of the Matabele =Death of Lobengula, and submission of the izinDuna= Matabeleland, 1887 Lobengula would die from smallpox on January 22 or 23 1894. Meanwhile, the Ndebele warriors gradually succumbed to the company's superior firepower. Soon after the king‚Äôs death, the Ndebele izinDuna submitted to the British South Africa Company. Charges were later made in the British House of Commons against the company, accusing them of having provoked the Ndebele in order to secure their territory. However, after enquiry the company was exonerated from the charge by Lord Ripon, the Colonial Secretary. =Lobengula's box of sovereigns= Following the end of the war, one of Lobengula's izinDuna said that just before Forbes' column had reached the Shangani on 3 December 1893, the king had attempted to buy the pioneers off. According to this story, two Matabele messengers, Petchan and Sehuloholu, had been given a box of gold sovereigns, and instructed to intercept the column before it reached the river. They were to tell the whites that the king admitted defeat, and offered this money in tribute if the BSAP would turn back. \\"Gold is the only thing that will stop the white men,\\" Lobengula reportedly said. Petchan and Sehuloholu reportedly reached the column on 2 December 1893, and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard. No man who had been attached to the column confirmed this, but company authorities thought it unlikely that the Matabele would simply invent such a story. Two officers' batmen were accused of accepting the gold, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message. The evidence against them was inconclusive, but they were found guilty and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour by the Resident Magistrate. They were released after two years, however, because the maximum term the Magistrate could give was three months; the convictions were ultimately quashed altogether on a re-assessment of the evidence by the High Commissioner's legal team. The truth of the matter has never been conclusively resolved. Aftermath In every step taken by the company, the guiding hand was that of Cecil Rhodes, a fact which received recognition when the company's territory officially received the name \\"Rhodesia\\" on May 3, 1895. During this year there was great activity in exploiting Matabeleland, with \\"Stands\\" or plots being sold at extraordinary prices in Bulawayo. Within nine months the rebuilt town of Bulawayo had a population of 1,900 colonials with over 2,000 more prospectors in the various goldfields. A new company, the African Transcontinental Company, was founded under the auspices of Col. Frank Rhodes, brother of Cecil, with the ultimate purpose of connecting the Cape with Cairo. The railway from Cape Town passed Mafeking, and approached the Rhodesian frontier, reaching Bulawayo in 1897. The east coast line to connect Salisbury (now Harare) with Beira, Mozambique (then Portuguese East Africa Colony) was completed in 1899. Maxim gun, 1895 vintage  Maxim gun  The First Matabele War was the first wartime use of a Maxim gun by Britain and it proved to have a decisive impact. In less than optimal situations, such as hilly or mountainous terrain or dense vegetation with poor lines of sight, the Maxim gun resulted in little direct impact on enemy deaths. But as a psychological weapon, the Maxim gun was truly phenomenal. It generated a sense of fear in the Ndebele and made the British South Africa Police seem invincible. In one engagement, for example, 50 company soldiers with just four Maxim guns fought off 5,000 Ndebele warriors.

It is based on the Dorothy Macardle novel Uneasy Freehold (1941), published in the United States as The Uninvited (1942). The film stars Ray Milland, Ruth Hussey, and Donald Crisp, and introduces Gail Russell. Its plot follows a brother and sister who purchase a home in Cornwall plagued by paranormal events. Set in England, The Uninvited was filmed at Paramount's Hollywood studios as well as locations in San Francisco and Phoenix, Arizona in 1943. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures, which released it theatrically in the United States in February 1944. Edith Head designed the costumes. The film has been claimed by contemporary film scholars as being among the first films in history to portray ghosts as legitimate entities rather than illusions or misunderstandings played for comedy. It depicts various supernatural phenomena, including disembodied voices, apparitions, and possession. Plot In 1937, London music critic and composer Roderick \\"Rick\\" Fitzgerald and his sister Pamela fall in love with Windward House, an abandoned seaside home, during a holiday on Cornwall's rocky coast. They purchase it for an unusually low price from Commander Beech. Rick and Pamela meet Beech‚Äôs 20-year-old granddaughter, Stella Meredith, who lives with her grandfather in the nearby town of Biddlecombe. Stella is deeply upset by the sale because of her attachment to the house, despite its being where her mother, Mary Meredith, fell to her death from a nearby cliff. The commander has forbidden Stella to enter the house or to see Rick. However, she gains access to Windward House through Rick, who becomes infatuated with her. The Fitzgeralds' initial enchantment with the house diminishes when they unlock an artist's studio where they feel an inexplicable chill. Just before dawn, Rick hears the sobs of an unseen woman, a phenomenon that Pamela investigates whilst awaiting her brother's return with their Irish housekeeper, Lizzie Flynn. The superstitious Lizzie notices a peculiar draft on the stairs. Rick and Pamela must face the obvious: Windward House is haunted. When Stella comes to Windward for dinner, she senses a spirit. Rather than fearing it, she associates the calming presence with her mother. Suddenly she dashes out towards the very cliff from which her mother Mary fell to her death seventeen years earlier. Rick catches her just before she reaches the edge. Stella professes to have no recollection of the near-fatal incident. The Fitzgeralds and the town physician, Dr. Scott, investigate. They learn that Stella's father, a painter, had had an affair with his model, a Spanish gypsy named Carmel. Mary, from all accounts a beautiful and virtuous woman, found out and took Carmel to Paris, leaving her there. Subsequently, Carmel returned to England, stole the infant Stella from Windward, and, during a confrontation, pushed Mary off the cliff to her death. Shortly afterward, Carmel became ill and died. Rick tries to dissuade Stella from her dangerous attraction to Windward by staging a s√©ance to convey the \\"message\\" that her mother wants her to stay away. However, the ghost takes over and communicates that it is guarding Stella. Stella becomes possessed by the spirit and begins muttering in Spanish. Distressed by Stella's renewed involvement with Windward, Beech sends Stella to a sanitorium run by Miss Holloway, Mary's friend and confidante. The Fitzgeralds visit and question Holloway, unaware that Stella is confined there. Holloway explains that after Mary's death, she took care of Carmel, who had contracted pneumonia and eventually died of it. Looking through the records of the previous village physician, Dr. Scott discovers that Holloway may have hastened Carmel's death. The doctor is called away to care for an ailing Beech, who tells him that Stella is at the sanitorium. Rick, Pam, and Scott telephone Miss Holloway to inform her that they are on their way. Holloway deceives Stella, saying that the Fitzgeralds have invited her to live with them. Stella happily takes the train home. Holloway tells the would-be rescuers that Stella is on her way to Windward House. There Stella finds only her grandfather in the studio. He begs Stella with his last strength to get out, but she remains at his side. When a ghost manifests, the commander succumbs to a heart attack. Stella welcomes the ghost, believing it to be her mother, but the apparition frightens her, and she flees towards the cliff. Rick and Dr. Scott get there just in time to pull Stella from the crumbling cliff to safety. Back inside, the group is drawn again to the physician's journal, which the friendly spirit has opened to a certain page. They discover that Carmel gave birth to a child in Paris, where Stella herself was born. The truth becomes clear: Carmel is Stella's mother. Stella's realization of her true parentage frees Carmel's spirit to leave Windward. Something evil, though, has remained. After sending everyone away, Rick confronts the spirit of Mary Meredith, telling her that they are no longer afraid of her and that she has no power over them any longer. Defeated, Mary's spirit departs.

Production The Uninvited was shot in San Francisco, California, and Phoenix, Arizona. It is among the first dramatic Hollywood feature films to portray a haunting as an authentic supernatural event.Hal Erickson‚Äôs Allmovie, via The New York Times Previously, ghosts had often been played for comedy (The Ghost Goes West, 1936; Topper, 1937), were revealed to be practical jokes (Blondie Has Servant Trouble, 1940) or as a subterfuge to obscure an illegal activity (The Cat and the Canary, 1939; Abbott and Costello‚Äôs Hold That Ghost, 1941). Paramount added special effects to the film, having decided at the last moment to emphasize its \\"supernatural premise\\"; those effects were removed by censors when the film was distributed in England. Music Victor Young's score produced a melody which became a standard, \\"Stella by Starlight\\", based on the film‚Äôs main theme. \\"Stella by Starlight\\" is prized by jazz musicians for its haunting and rich harmony. It has been recorded numerous times, by such artists as Miles Davis, Stan Getz and Dexter Gordon, and as a vocal (with lyrics by Ned Washington) by singers Dick Haymes, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald among others. Reception Upon the film's February 1944 release, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that The Uninvited was \\"as solemnly intent on raising gooseflesh as any ghost-story weirdly told to a group of shivering youngsters around a campfire on a dark and windy night.\\" A review in the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film very good technically with \\"some beautiful coastal scenery\\" and attempts at reconstructing a Devon village, as well as \\"beautiful interiors\\" of the haunted house. The reviewer concluded, \\"It remains a question, however, whether such a film should ever be made, producing visual evidence of unexplained occult phenomena which, to say the least, have never yet been photographed.\\" It received critical praise, and the film's cinematographer, Charles Lang, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography at the 17th Academy Awards, losing to Joseph LaShelle, who won for his work on Laura. As of March 2016, the film holds a rating of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 8/10. According to Turner Classic Movies, the film is a \\"handsomely mounted thriller with a first-rate cast, atmospheric cinematography by Charles Lang, Victor Young's emotionally gripping score, and a highly original story that invites Freudian interpretations of the characters while inserting a lesbian subtext and a droll sense of humor.... While it might have chilled audiences of its era, The Uninvited is not a frightening film by contemporary standards. It is, however, an intriguing mood piece, as subtle and suggestive in its imagery as the best of Val Lewton's work.\\" In 2009, director Martin Scorsese placed The Uninvited on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Guillermo Del Toro also lists the film as one of the horror films to have scared and affected him. The character of Miss Holloway has been cited as a lesbian caricature.Uninvited: Classical Hollywood Cinema and Lesbian Representability by Patricia White, Indiana University Press, 1999; Adaptations The Screen Guild Theater presented a half-hour radio adaptation of The Uninvited on August 28, 1944, with Ray Milland, Ruth Hussey and Betty Field.

It pitted the British South Africa Company against the Matabele people, which led to conflict with the Shona people in the rest of Southern Rhodesia. In March 1896, the Matabele revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company. The Mlimo (or M'limo, or Umlimo) the Matabele spiritual leader, was credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. He convinced the Matabele and the Shona that the settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time. The Mlimo's call to battle was well-timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid. This left the country nearly defenceless. The British immediately sent troops to suppress the Matabele and the Shona, but it cost the lives of many on both sides. Months passed before the British forces were strong enough to break the sieges and defend the major settlements and, war raged on until October of the following year. The War in Matabeleland =Rebellion= The Mlimo planned to wait until the night of 29 March, the first full moon, to take Bulawayo by surprise immediately after a ceremony called the Big Dance. He promised, through his priests, that if the Matabele went to war, the bullets of the settlers would change to water and their cannon shells would become eggs. His plan was to kill all of the settlers in Bulawayo first, but not to destroy the town itself as it would serve again as the royal kraal for the newly reincarnated King Lobengula. The Mlimo decreed that the settlers should be attacked and driven from the country through the Mangwe Pass on the Western edge of the Matobo Hills, which was to be left open and unguarded for this reason. Once the settlers were purged from Bulawayo, the Matabele and Shona warriors would head out into the countryside and continue the slaughter until all the settlers were either killed or had fled. However, several young Matabele were overly anxious to go to war, and the rebellion started prematurely. On 20 March, Matabele rebels shot and stabbed a native policeman. Over the next few days, other outlying settlers and prospectors were killed. Frederick Selous, the famous big-game hunter, had heard rumours of settlers in the countryside being killed, but he thought it was a localised problem. When news of the policeman's murder reached Selous on 23 March, he knew the Matabele had started a massive uprising. Nearly 2,000 Matabele warriors began the rebellion in earnest on 24 March. Many, although not all, of the young native police quickly deserted and joined the rebels. The Matabele headed into the countryside armed with a variety of weapons, including: Martini-Henry rifles, Winchester repeaters, Lee-Metfords, assegais, knobkerries and battle-axes. As news of the massive rebellion spread, the Shona joined in the fighting, and the settlers headed towards Bulawayo. Within a week, 141 settlers were slain in Matabeleland, another 103 killed in Mashonaland, and hundreds of homes, ranches and mines were burned. A particularly tragic case occurred at the Insiza River where Mrs. Fourie and her 6 small children were found mutilated beyond recognition on their farmstead. Two young women of the Ross family living nearby were similarly killed in their newly built home.One Man's Vision by W.D.Gale 1935 p240 =Siege of Bulawayo= Sketch by Robert Baden-Powell of a Ndebele warrior With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager of sandbagged wagons in the centre of Bulawayo on their own. Barbed wire was added to Bulawayo's defences. Oil-soaked fagots were arranged in strategic locations in case of attack at night. Blasting gelatin was secreted in outlying buildings that were beyond the defence perimeter, to be exploded in the event the enemy occupied them. Smashed glass bottles were spread around the front of the wagons. Except for hunting rifles, there were few weapons to be found in Bulawayo. Fortunately for settlers, there were a few working artillery pieces and a small assortment of machine guns. Rather than wait passively, the settlers immediately mounted patrols, called the Bulawayo Field Force, under such figures as Selous and Frederick Russell Burnham; these rode out to rescue any surviving settlers in the countryside and went on attack against the Matabele. Selous raised a mounted troop of forty men to scout southward into the Matobo Hills. Maurice Gifford, along with 40 men, rode east along the Iniza River. Whenever settlers were found, they were quickly loaded into their wagons and closely guarded on their way to Bulawayo. Within the first week of fighting, 20 men of the Bulawayo Field Force were killed and another 50 were wounded. Map of Bulawayo-Matobo Hills, drawn by Baden-Powell In the First Matabele War, the Matabele had experienced the effectiveness of the settlers' Maxim guns, so they never mounted a significant attack against Bulawayo even though over 10,000 Matabele warriors could be seen near the town. Conditions inside Bulawayo, however, quickly became unbearable. During the day, settlers could go to homes and buildings within the town, but at night they were forced to seek shelter in the much smaller laager. Nearly 1,000 women and children were crowded into the city, and false alarms of attacks were common. Although they kept up their siege, the Matabele made one critical error: they neglected to cut the telegraph lines connecting Bulawayo to Mafeking. This gave both the relief forces and the besieged Bulawayo Field Force far more information than they would otherwise have had. Several relief columns were organised to break the siege, but the long trek through hostile countryside took several months. Late in May, the first two relief columns appeared near Bulawayo on almost the same day but from opposite directions ‚Äì Cecil Rhodes and Col. Beal arriving from Salisbury and Fort Victoria in Mashonaland 300 miles to the north; and Lord Grey and Col. Plumer (of the York and Lancaster Regiment) from Kimberley and Mafeking, 600 miles to the south. The southern relief forces were nearly ambushed on their approach to Bulawayo, but Selous discovered the whereabouts of the Matabele and the Maxim guns of the relief forces drove back the attackers. Not long after relief forces began arriving in Bulawayo, General Frederick Carrington arrived to take overall command along with his Chief of Staff, Colonel Baden-Powell. With the siege broken, an estimated 50,000 Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matobo Hills near Bulawayo. This region became the scene of the fiercest fighting between the settler patrols and the Matabele. By June, the Shona kept their promise and joined the fighting on the side of the Matabele. But lacking a clear leader similar to Mlimo, the Shonas mostly stayed behind their fortifications and conducted few raids. =Assassination of Mlimo= Rhodes makes peace with the Ndebele in Matobo Hills, 1896; sketch by Baden-Powell Military intelligence at the time thought that capturing the Mlimo would be the speediest way to end the war. The location of the Mlimo's cave had been disclosed to the native commissioner at Mangwe, Bonar Armstrong, by an unnamed Zulu informant. Armstrong immediately brought this information to the Chief of Scouts, Burnham, and the two men presented it to the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, Earl Grey. The Administrator instructed them to present this information to the military commander, General Carrington, who called in his Chief of Staff, Baden-Powell. Carrington instructed Burnham, Armstrong, and Baden-Powell to leave that very night to \\"Capture the Mlimo if you can. Kill him if you must. Do not let him escape.\\". Intervening news of enemy movements near Bembezi forced Baden-Powell to go there instead, so Burnham and Armstrong proceeded on their own to the Matopos. Burnham and Armstrong travelled by night through the Matobo Hills and approached the sacred cave. Not far from the cave was a village of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two scouts tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow and cautious movements with branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Once Mlimo started his dance of immunity, Burnham shot him just below the heart, killing him. The two men then leapt over the dead Mlimo and ran down a trail towards their horses. Hundreds of warriors, encamped nearby, picked up their arms and started in pursuit. Burnham set fire to the village as a distraction. The two men hurried back to Bulawayo, with warriors in pursuit After the assassination, overseas press hailed Burnham and Armstrong as \\"heroes of the British Empire.\\" But in Rhodesia, sections of the press were sceptical about the assassination of the Mlimo. It had been a mistake on the part of British military intelligence to think of the Mlimo and the high priest, or prophet, in the Matopos as one and the same. Based on British Army reports, Carrington believed that the Mlimo was a central authority and that \\"his orders fly about from one end of the country to another with great rapidity\\". Historian Terence Ranger writes that \\"Carrington was almost certainly over-estimating the centralization (of the Mlimo)\\", and that \\"Baden-Powell and other reporters tended to run the various shrines in the Matopos into one\\". Frederick Selous believed that the head priest of the Mlimo lived in the Matopos, but that \\"there are other priests, or so-called Umlimos, in other parts of the country through whom they believe that the commands of the Almighty can be conveyed to them.\\" Burnham had carried out his instructions from Carrington and, like Carrington, he relied heavily on Armstrong and military intelligence for his information. Armstrong, the instigator and active participant in the operation, \\"was an authority on the Native, his language, customs and mentality\\", according to fellow native commissioner E.C. Harley. Armstrong was also a Major in the Mangwe Field Force, and Selous describes him as young, but \\"shrewd and capable\\". Selous and Harley say that Armstrong was in command at the Mangwe laager, although Baden- Powell and other sources name van Rooyen and Lee as the commanders. Some writers also describe Armstrong as young and moody and claim that he too expressed doubts about the identity of the man killed, but only after the assassination. Initially the Company declined to review the matter and Burnham left Rhodesia on 11 July 1896, a week after the Bulawayo Field Force disbanded, to return to the United States and later joined the Klondike Gold Rush. However, at Armstrong's insistence a court of inquiry was later appointed to investigate the assassination. Although several writers have commented on the outcome, the official report itself has been lost. Referring to the court's report, Harley writes, \\"The finding of the Judge (Watermeyer) was that the native killed was the Chief Priest of the M'limo. Whether there was another occult personage associated with the M'limo deception is problematical, for with the death of the Chief Priest, the M'limo deception also died.\\" But historian Hugh Marshall Hole writes, \\"On their return they were greatly applauded for having achieved their dangerous errand, but some time later, when it was found that Mlimo was still at work, an official inquiry was held, with the result that the whole affair was exposed as an elaborate hoax.\\" In contrast to Hole, historians Mary and Richard Bradford, Mary Clarke, Peter Emmerson, and Jack Lott all agree with Harley that the court of inquiry favoured Armstrong. Emmerson cites an 1899 report from chief native commissioner H.J. Taylor as evidence that Watermeyer ruled in favour of Armstrong. Mary and Richard Bradford studied Taylor's 1899 report, and Hole's correspondence, and they suggest specific errors made by Hole in his interpretation of Taylor's report. Clarke and Lott both point out that Armstrong was given a gold watch and a letter of appreciation from the Board of the British South Africa Company after the verdict was rendered. As to the identity of the man assassinated and his role, there is much confusion. In June 1896, Father Prestage, captain van Rooyen, Hans Lee, and Armstrong met at Mangwe with \\"Several hundred natives assembled to hear the statement made by witnesses that Gotani the man shot by Burnham was the M'limo of the Matabele.\\" Harley states that \\"At (the Watermeyer) enquiry, Father Prestage from his knowledge of the Umlimo and the power he exercised was able to supply authoritative information which greatly assisted the enquiry.\\" But chief native commissioner Taylor's 1899 report, written three years after the event and after Armstrong resigned from the Company over unrelated grievances, says that \\"Armstrong by threats and bribes caused certain natives to perjure themselves and to swear to what was not true\\". Taylor includes in his report an affidavit by \\"one Jonas, head messenger at the A.N.C's office at Mangwe,\\" who says, \\"I swore on oath that Jobane was the M'limo, I knew I was lying at the time, I have never received any cattle from Mr. Armstrong but he paid me the five shillings.\\" Taylor also states in his report that \\"Dshobane, (was) the supposed Mlimo\\" assassinated, however, he does not make it clear if \\"Jobane\\" and \\"Dshobane\\" are different spellings for the same person. Over the years, historians have postulated several more names for the man assassinated and his role. In 1966, Ranger hypothesized that the man assassinated was not from the Matopos at all, but rather a \\"loyal\\" priest of the Kalanga tribe from the Southwest of Matabeleland, and Ranger quotes an 1879 report from a missionary, Joseph Cockin, that states that the priest from the Southwest was named Umkombo. But in 1967, Ranger states that Jobani (or Tshobani) had been the high priest in the Southwest and that \\"They obtained from the indunas of the Mangwe area affidavits that the dead man, Jobani or Habangana, had been the High Priest of the Mwari and the chief instigator of the rebellion.\\" In 1976, Lott said that Ranger relied on \\"the American scholar Richard Werbner\\" for his assessments, and that \\"recent research has confirmed that Burnham killed the rainmaker (Iwosana) of the tribe (Makalanga) who was Hobani or Tshobani (Sindebele), fourth son of Banko's family.\\" In 1994, Mary and Richard Bradford state that \\"Burnham may have shot an innocent man, but if so, there was no premeditated plan. He was acting under orders.\\" The Bradfords further remark, \\"If Jobani was innocent, he was a victim not of Burnham but of white misconception of the M'limo cult and of the difficulty in distinguishing friend from foe that marks irregular warfare.\\" While there appears to be no clear consensus about either the identity of man assassinated in the Matopos or his role, historian Howard Hensman states \\"With the downfall of Wedza and shooting of the M'Limo in a cave in the Matoppos by the American scout, Burnham, the Matabele rebellion may be said to have come to an end.\\" Upon learning of the death of Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and persuaded the Matabele warriors to lay down their arms. With the war in Matabeland effectively over, the Bulawayo Field Force disbanded on 4 July 1896. With regard to the regular forces under Carrington, Hensman writes \\"As the rainy season approached and peace was arranged in Matabeleland, the forces, or a considerable portion of them, were moved up into Mashonaland\\". War in Mashonaland War broke out on 17 June 1896 at Mazowe with an attack by the Hwata dynasty on Alice Mine. This was followed by the medium Nehanda Nyakasikana capturing and executing Mazowe Native Commissioner Pollard. Other religious figures who led the rebellion included Kaguvi Gumboreshumba, who was active in the Goromonzi area and Mukwati, a priest of the Mwari shrinePena, L. 2000. The Revolt of the Zimbabwean Masses: Part 1: How Did it Begin? who was active throughout Mashonaland.M. Sibanda, H. Moyana et al. 1992. The African Heritage. History for Junior Secondary Schools. Book 1. Zimbabwe Publishing House. In addition to the mediums, traditional leaders played a major role in the rebellion, notably Chief Mashayamombe, who led resistance in his chieftaincy in Mhondoro, south of the colonial settlement of Salisbury barracks (now Harare). He was amongst the first chiefs to rebel and the last to be defeated.Keppel-Jones, A. 1983. Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe, 1884‚Äì1902. McGill-Queen's University Press. He was supplied by many of the surrounding districts, such as Chikomba (then Charter).Beach, D.N. 1970. Afrikaner and Shona Settlement in the Enkeldoorn Area, 1890‚Äì1900. Zambezia, 1, 5‚Äì34. Other chiefs who played an important role included Gwabayana, Makoni, Mapondera, Mangwende and Seke.Adu Boahen, A. 1990. Africa Under Colonial Domination, 1880‚Äì1935. James Currey. With the war in Matabeleland ending, Gen. Carrington was able to concentrate his forces on Mashonaland and the rebels retreated into granite kopjes. With no central command to oppose him, Carrington was able to bring Maxim guns against each stronghold in turn, until resistance ended. Nehanda Nyakasikana and Kaguvi Gumboreshumba were captured and executed in 1898, but Mukwati was never captured and died in Mutoko. Legacy The rebellion failed completely and did not result in any major changes in BSAC policy. For example, the hut tax which remained in place. The territories of Matabeleland and Mashonaland had become known as South Zambesia, and both the Matabele and Shona became subjects of the Rhodes administration. It was only 25 years later in 1924 that the entire region became officially named a British Crown Colony. Until 1924, the region was owned by a private company which had purchased it from various chieftains and Lobengula; facts often neglected in 21st century history lessons. However, the legacy of leaders such as Kaguvi, Mapondera and Nehanda was to inspire future generations.Maritz, J. 1989. Towards a Zimbabwean Aeneid: a pedagogical exercise. Zambezia, 16, 151‚Äì157 . =Birthplace of Scouting= Burnham, Matobo Hills, 1896 Soon after the outbreak of the war, Baden-Powell was assigned to Matabeleland as Chief of Staff to Gen. Carrington and it was here that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British. This would become a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. Burnham had been a scout practically his entire life in the United States when he went to Africa in 1893 to scout for Cecil Rhodes on the Cape-to-Cairo Railway. As Chief of Scouts under Major Allan Wilson, Burnham became known in Africa as he-who-sees-in-the-dark and he gained fame in the First Matabele War when he survived the British equivalent of Custer's Last Stand, the Shangani Patrol. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham began teaching Baden-Powell woodcraft, inspiring him and giving him the plan for both the programme and the code of honour of Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British, but well known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and it was here that Baden-Powell acquired his Kudu horn, the Matabele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first boy scouts and to call them together in training courses. =1901 Mapondera Rebellion= In 1901, Chief Kadungure Mapondera, who had in 1894 proclaimed his independence of company rule, led a rebellion in the Guruve and Mount Darwin areas of Mashonaland Central. He led a force of initially under 100 men, but had over 600 under his command by mid-1901. He was captured in 1903 and died in jail in 1904 after a hunger strike.Beach, D.N. 1989. Mapondera: heroism and history in Northern Zimbabwe, 1840‚Äì1904. Mambo Press, Gweru, =Monuments= In his will, Rhodes directed that he be buried in the Matopos Hills; when he died in the Cape in 1902 his body was brought to Bulawayo by train. His burial was attended by Ndebele chiefs, who asked that the firing party not discharge their rifles, as this would disturb the spirits. Then, for the first and probably the only time, they gave a European person the Matabele royal salute, \\"Bayete\\". Rhodes is buried alongside Jameson and the 34 company soldiers killed in the Shangani Patrol.

Gen. Leonidas Paraskevopoulos and his chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Theodoros Pangalos. Aristeidis Stergiadis () (1861, in Kandiye (Herakleion), Girit Eyalet, Ottoman Empire - 22 June 1949, in Nice, France) was the Greek high commissioner, or governor-general, of Smyrna during the Greek occupation of the city from 1919 to 1922. Aristidis Stergiadis was appointed the High Commissioner of Smyrna in February and arrived in the city four days after the 15 May 1919 landing. Stergiadis immediately went to work in setting up an administration, easing ethnic violence, and making way for permanent annexation of Smyrna. Stergiadis punished Greek soldiers responsible for the violence on 15‚Äì16 May with court martial and created a commission to decide on payment for victims (made up of representatives from Great Britain, France, Italy and other allies). When the French ceded Cilicia to the Ottomans in 1921 under the terms of the Treaty of Ankara (1921), the French withdrew their protection from the Greek population. It is estimated that 6,500 Rum left Cilicia as a result. Some of the refugees were transported to Cyprus but the British would only accept refugees holding British nationality or those who had relatives on the island. The others were sent to Smyrna, only to find that Stergiadis would not permit the landing of refugees. Stergiadis took a strict stance against discrimination of the Turkish population in Smyrna and opposed church leaders and the local Greek population on a number of occasions. Historians disagree about whether this was a genuine stance against discriminationClogg, Richard. A Concise History of Greece, page 93 . Cambridge University Press, 20 June 2002 ‚Äì 308 pages. or whether it was an attempt to present a positive vision of the occupation to the Entente. This stance against discrimination of the Turkish population often pitted Stergiadis against the local Greek population, the church and the army. He reportedly would carry a stick through the town with which he would beat Greeks that were being abusive of Turkish citizens. Troops would disobey his orders to not abuse the Turkish population often putting him in conflict with the military. On 14 July 1919, the acting foreign secretary sent a long critical telegraph to Venizelos suggesting that Stergiadis be removed and writing that \\"His sick neuroticism has reached a climax.\\" Venizelos stuck with support of Stergiadis despite this opposition, while the latter oversaw a number of projects planning for a permanent Greek administration of Smyrna. At one point, Stergiadis interrupted and ended a sermon by the bishop Chrysostomos that he believed to be incendiary. George Horton writes: :On one occasion I was present at an important service in the Orthodox Cathedral, to which the representative of the various powers, as well as the principal Greek authorities had been invited. The high-commissioner had given the order that the service should be strictly religious and non-political. Unfortunately, Archbishop Chrysostom (he who was later murdered by the Turks) began to introduce some politics into his sermon, a thing which he was extremely prone to do. Sterghiades, who was standing near him, interrupted, saying: \\"But I told you I didn‚Äôt want any of this.\\" The archbishop flushed, choked, and breaking off his discourse abruptly, ended with, \\"In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, Amen,\\" and stepped off the rostrum. He abandoned Smyrna on 25 September 1922 on a British ship, and was transported to Britain. He died 22 June 1949. His Herakleion residence houses the Public Archives and Library of Nicolas Kitsikis (1887‚Äì1978), the father of Dimitri Kitsikis. Stergiadis was the stepfather of Beata Kitsikis n√©e Petychakis, Dimitri Kitsikis's mother.

Wedigo von Plotho, who saved the life of Margrave Waldemar at Gransee in 1316 History The family is documented as early as 946 in a writ of Otto the Great as already in possession of their ancient seat at Burg Plote in Altenplathow, Elb-Havelland in Brandenburg. Its line of recorded continuous descent dates from the 12th century, with Hermann I von Plotho. The family's extensive possessions, from the 11th and 12th centuries, centred on the old Prignitz region and included Kyritz, Wusterhausen and Genthin, the territory of Schollene, the castle at Plote (Altenplathow), the Gaue of Lietzici, Zemzizi and Drenzile, and the lordship of . It was also closely associated with the Bishops of Magdeburg: Hermann I, whose Romanesque monumental effigy is still to be seen in the church of Altenplathow was a vassal of the bishops and other members of the family were canons of Magdeburg Cathedral. Its vassals included the von Blumenthal family, whom it brought from Blumenthal in the diocese of Magdeburg to Blumenthal in the Prignitz. In the Middle Ages the family ramified throughout Northern Germany and numerous different branches descend from them - among others, the lines of von Plotho zu Grabow, R√§ckendorf, Codlewe and Zerben, and of particular note the Flanders branch of von Plotho zu Ingelmunster - many of which survive today. In 1643 Wolfgang Edler von Plotho was made a baron of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Ferdinand III for his military services. In modern times the family is best known for the fact that Elisabeth von Plotho (1853-1952) was the model for Effi Briest in Theodore Fontane's novel of that name.

The Atlanta Journal called him \\"the South‚Äôs first world champion in any sport.\\" Biography Hamm was born in 1906, to Charles Edward Hamm, a plumber and electrician, and Zilpah Dare Harris Hamm. He was the oldest of five brothers and one sister. Raised in Lonoke, he excelled in sports, especially track and field. At Lonoke High School, he won the state long jump for three years straight, 1923 to 1925, setting a state record of 23'2\\" his sophomore year. He won the state 220-yard dash all three years and the state 100-yard dash twice, despite attacks of malaria, which first affected him in his junior year and undoubtedly prevented him from bettering his records. Hamm and teammate Hubert Davis were the only two Lonoke competitors to enter a high school invitational meet at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville in 1925. He won first in the 100-yard dash, the 200-yard dash, the long jump, and the high jump, as well as finishing third place in the 440. Though the two could not enter the relays, together they won the meet by two points over Little Rock High School. In his junior year (1924) Hamm set a world high school record of 24'2‚Öù\\" (7.38 m), which qualified him for the Olympic trials in Boston, Massachusetts. To pay for his trip, he borrowed $100 from Little Rock (Pulaski County) coach Earl Quigley. He failed to qualify for the Olympics, but the next year he went to Little Rock, regularly bringing Quigley two to five dollars until he repaid the money. At Georgia Tech, Hamm won the Southeast Conference championship (now the Southeastern Conference) in 100 yd and 220 yd sprints and the long jump three years straight. In 1928, he broke the SEC record in the long jump with a leap of 25'6¬æ\\", won the National Intercollegiate meet, and broke the world record in the 1928 Olympic trials with a jump of 25'11¬Ω\\". On July 31, at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Holland, Hamm broke the Olympic record and won a gold medal with a leap of 25'4¬æ\\". After the Olympics, he was part of a track and field team that toured England and Germany. He won the long jump in every meet. Hamm graduated from Georgia Tech in 1928, served as the school's track coach for a few years, and then spent the rest of his life in private business, much of it as an executive with Coca-Cola on the West Coast and in Alaska. He was married three times, and died in June 1982 in Oregon. His ashes were scattered over his beloved Clear Lake in Oregon's Willamette National Forest, where he had fished many times. He was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 1971, and the Arkansas Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1996. Hamm donated his trophies to Georgia Tech in 1970 which were displayed in the Student Center on campus.

It chronicles his early life in Western Australia, his experiences as a private during the Gallipoli campaign of World War I and his return to civilian life after the war. It also documents his extraordinary life of hardship, loss, friendship and love. During the initial days of its publication, Albert Facey became a nationwide celebrity. Notwithstanding the interest in it, Facey considered his life to be simple and \\"had no idea what all the fuss was about\\". When asked in an interview, where the name of the book originated, he replied, \\"I called it 'A Fortunate Life' because I truly believe that is what I had\\". It has become a classic piece of Australian literature and is one of Australia‚Äôs most beloved books. it has sold over one million copies since its publication in 1981 and become a primary account of the Australian experience during World War I. It is also featured in many Australian primary and secondary schools as a recommended book for young adults. Overview =Plot summary= The autobiography begins at his birth. Albert Barnett Facey was born in Maidstone, Victoria, Australia, in 1894, the youngest of seven children. His father died in 1896 of typhoid fever after moving to the Goldfields of Western Australia with Bert‚Äôs two eldest brothers. In 1898, Bert's Grandpa became ill and died in October that year. Bert's mother then left the rest of her children to be looked after by their grandmother Mrs Jane Carr (born 1832 ‚Äì died 1932), to go to the Goldfields, but met and married another man and had nothing further to do with Bert's upbringing. In 1899 Bert moved from Victoria to the Goldfields in the care of his grandmother, together with three of his six older siblings: Roy, Eric and Myra. Most of his childhood was spent in the Wickepin area, some south east of Perth. His aunt and her husband had been granted an agricultural lease there, so the children moved with them and Mrs Carr to start a farm. At the age of eight, although two older brothers remained, when a neighbouring farmer offered a wage and all found, Bert was put into service. His new employer, a horse thief, was given to violent drunken rages, but after being given a severe horsewhipping, Bert managed to escape. Work on subsequent farms were much better experiences and Bert's appreciation of life in the bush grew. Bert had not lost touch with his uncle's farm, his grandmother and siblings. At the age of 14, when Roy and Eric resolved to go to live with their mother, who was by then in Perth, he took the decision to leave the very companionable family set-up he had found himself working for and go to live with her. He had had no contact with her for 12 years and it soon became clear that although his mother was pleased to see them all, she was more interested in the money they could provide. Bert left, took up work as a cattle drover, had another spell at his mother's, then worked as a railway line navvy. Bert had developed an interest in boxing while in Perth, which was put to use dealing with the vindictive line construction overseer. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, there had been no possibility of formal education, but Bert taught himself to read and write. Looking for work in the pre-war years, he realised that he was not comfortable with paperwork, offices and cities, far preferring life in the bush. He had become an accomplished horseman, bushman, and at 18 was a professional boxer. In August 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign of the First World War, Joseph and Roy, two of his brothers, were killed, and Bert was badly injured. He suffered severe problems, which the medics were unable to either explain or treat. Whilst recuperating, he met his future wife Evelyn Mary Gibson. The medics had given him two years to live, but they resolved to enjoy every day together and were married in Bunbury in August 1916. The Faceys lived in East Perth before returning to Wickepin six years later with their children, where they lived until 1934. His wife died in 1976, shortly before what would have been their sixtieth wedding anniversary. The couple had seven childrenthe eldest, Barney, was killed during the Second World Warand twenty-eight grandchildren. =Origins and publishing history= Facey had been making notes on his life since an early age, and had been entertaining family and friends for decades with his stories which, over the years, became more and more polished (at times at the cost of historical accuracy). At the urging of his wife, he eventually wrote them up into a full manuscript, by hand, in a series of exercise books, working at the kitchen table. He then had the manuscript typed up and sent it to Fremantle Arts Centre Press, requesting that twenty copies be printed and bound for family members and friends. Facey's story was so remarkable, however, that it was immediately accepted for commercial publication. It appeared just nine months before his death on 11 February 1982, in his 88th year. Achievements =Awards and honours= Albert Facey and A Fortunate Life have been the recipients of a host of award nominations since the initial publication of the book but have only won two major book awards. It won the 1981 Banjo Award for Australian Literature and then the 1981 New South Wales Literacy Award. In 2004 the book was named as Australia's 10th most popular on the ABC's My Favourite Book list. Other media =Mini series= A Fortunate Life was a mini series based on the novel, which screened in 1986 on the Nine Network. It was narrated by Bill Kerr and featured many well known Australian actors. It starred a cast of young actors who started their careers in this series: Scott Bartle (plays Bert aged 5), Antony Richards (Bert aged 9), Benedict Sweeney (Bert aged 14) and Donovan Curyer Oshlack (plays Roy aged 14‚Äì16). It was filmed in Mount Tom Price, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Mullewa, Fremantle and Victoria Park. The mini-series was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in March 2008 and is compatible with all region codes. it was available for streaming on Prime Video in Australia.

Because the collection has the overall appearance of a single flower, the collection of flowers in the head of this sunflower is called a pseudanthium or a composite. A pseudanthium (Greek for \\"false flower\\"), also called a flower head, composite flower, or capitulum, is a special type of inflorescence, in which anything from a small cluster to hundreds or sometimes thousands of flowers are grouped together to form a single flower-like structure. Pseudanthia take various forms. The individual flowers of a pseudanthium commonly are called florets. The real flowers (the florets) are generally small and often greatly reduced, but the pseudanthium itself can sometimes be quite large (as in the heads of some varieties of sunflower). Pseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower family (Asteraceae), whose flowers are differentiated into ray flowers and disk flowers, unique to this family. The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium are actinomorphic and the corolla is fused into a tube. Flowers on the periphery are zygomorphic and the corolla has one large lobe (the so- called \\"petals\\" of a daisy are individual ray flowers, for example). Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some plants: Senecio vulgaris lacks ray flowers and Taraxacum officinale lacks disk flowers. The pseudanthium has a whorl of bracts below the flowers, forming an involucre. In all cases, a pseudanthium (inflorescence) is superficially indistinguishable from a flower, but closer inspection of its anatomy will reveal that it is composed of multiple flowers. Thus, the pseudanthium represents an evolutionary convergence of the inflorescence to a reduced reproductive unit that may function in pollination like a single flower, at least in plants that are animal pollinated. Related terms =Head= This is an equivalent term for flower head and pseudanthium when used in the botanical sense. =Capitulum (plural capitula)= Capitulum can be used as an exact synonym for pseudanthium and flower head; however its use is generally but not always restricted to the family Asteraceae. At least one source defines it as a small flower head. In addition to its botanical use as a term meaning flower head it is also used to mean the top of the sphagnum plant. =Calathid (plural calathids or calathidia)= This is a very rarely used term. It was defined in the 1966 book, The genera of flowering plants (Angiospermae), as a specific term for a flower head of a plant in the family Asteraceae. However, on-line botanical glossaries do not define it and Google Scholar does not link to any significant usage of the term in a botanical sense. Plant families Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum cochlearispathum) pseudanthium Pseudanthia occur in the following plant families: *Apiaceae ‚Äî pseudanthia are called umbels *Araceae ‚Äî pseudanthia are called spadices *Asteraceae *Campanulaceae *Centrolepidaceae *Cornaceae *Cyperaceae *Dipsacaceae *Euphorbiaceae ‚Äî pseudanthia are called cyathia *Eriocaulaceae *Hamamelidaceae *Moraceae *Myrtaceae ‚Äî in Actinodium *Poaceae *Pontederiaceae ‚Äî in Hydrothrix *Proteaceae *Rubiaceae *Saururaceae ‚Äî in Anemopsis In some families it is not yet clear whether the 'flower' represents a pseudanthium, because the anatomical work has not been done (or is still ambiguous due to considerable evolutionary reduction).

History Trundle lay on the southern boundary of the Wangaibon people's traditional lands. Trundle Lagoon Post Office opened on 1 May 1889 and was renamed Trundle in 1892. The (NSW) Geographical Names Board's only record of the origin of the name is a State Rail Authority's archives document on station names which indicates that the name probably originated from Trundle (hill-fort), about 24 km north-east of Portsmouth, England. ['Trundle' is an old English word for 'circle'.] The archives document also said that it was the name of William Cumming's leased runs in 1859, which he called Trundle Lagoon; that the 1866 Gazetteer recorded that Trundle Lagoon was occupied by George and John Palmer; and that the school opened as Trundle Lagoon in 1883, then Trundle in 1885. =Hotel= Trundle Hotel early photo The Trundle Hotel was opened 17 March 1912, replacing an earlier 1888 building. The hotel was designed with long halls and corridors to allow cool draughts to flow through the building. The building was constructed by A.E.Ware for 5,000 pounds ($10,000). The hotel claims the second longest hotel balcony (with 68 metres facing Forbes St and 18 metres facing Parkes St), in New South Wales. (The longest hotel balcony in New South Wales is in Cobar, at 91 metres.) Today The town is noted for having one of the widest main streets in the country, at 60 metres.

She received lessons from Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, who directed a private family performance of Guy Mannering, Bertin's first opera, in 1825. This opera, never formally produced, took its story line from the book of the same name, written by Sir Walter Scott. Two years later, Bertin's second opera, Le Loup-garou, was produced at the Op√©ra-Comique. At the age of 21, Bertin began working on the opera semiseria Fausto to her own libretto in Italian, based on Goethe's Faust, a subject \\"almost certainly suggested\\" by her father.Eric Blom (ed.), Everyman's Dictionary of Music (1946; 1954), s.v. \\"Fausto\\". A performance of the completed opera was scheduled for 1830. However, due to many unforeseen complications, Fausto did not actually reach the stage until a full year later. It was not well received and only saw three performances. Shortly before this, Bertin became friends with Victor Hugo. Hugo himself had sketched out an operatic version of his book Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) and between the two of them, the opera La Esmeralda was born, Hugo providing the libretto. Bertin was the only composer to have collaborated directly with Hugo on an opera. However, as the opera's run began in 1836, there were accusations against Bertin and her family, claiming she had special privileges due to her brother Armand's connection to the government's opera administration. During the seventh performance, a riot ensued, and the run of La Esmeralda was forced to end, though a version of the opera continued to be performed over the next three years. The composer Hector Berlioz, who helped Bertin with the staging and production of La Esmeralda, was also accused of providing the better music of this work, a charge he vehemently denied.Hector Berlioz, Memoirs, chapter XLVII. In frustration, Bertin refused to write any more operas. In 1837, Franz Liszt transcribed the orchestral score for solo piano (S.476) and made a piano transcription of the \\"Air chant√© par Massol\\" (S.477). Bertin did, however, continue to compose in many different genres. Her later compositions include twelve cantatas, six piano ballades, five chamber symphonies, a few string quartets, a piano trio (which includes themes from both her early Fausto and La Esmeralda), and many vocal selections. Of these, only the ballades and the trio were published. Poetry Bertin also wrote and published two volumes of poetry, Les Glanes in 1842 and Nouvelles Glanes in 1876. The former of these received a prize from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Bertin died in Paris the year after the publication of Nouvelles Glanes.

Facey was an Australian writer and World War I veteran, whose main work was his autobiography, A Fortunate Life, now considered a classic of Australian literature. it has sold over one million copies and was the subject of a television mini-series. Early life Facey was born in Maidstone, Victoria, the son of Joseph Facey and Mary Ann Facey, n√©e Carr. His father died on the goldfields of Western Australia in 1896 of typhoid fever, when Albert was two years old. In 1898, Albert's mother departed for Western Australia to care for her older children, who had accompanied their father to the goldfields. She left her younger children, including Albert, to the care of their grandmother. When his grandfather died in 1898, the grandmother, Mrs Jane Carr, (n√©e Barnett), moved with Albert and his siblings Roy (born 1890), Eric (born 1889) and Myra (born 1892) in 1899 from Barkers Creek near Castlemaine, Victoria, to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He began his working life around 1902, aged eight, and hardly ever lived with his family again. He was never able to attend school, but he managed to teach himself to read and write when he was in his teens. On his first job as a farm boy, his employer subjected him to virtual slavery and violent beatings with a horse whip. After sustaining months of such abuse, Albert escaped by walking over through the bush and luckily finding some new settlers that had camped. Although the police were informed of the abuse, his employer was never prosecuted. The scars on his back and neck from the injuries he had sustained remained evident for the rest of his life. In 1908 Facey's mother remarried, and he travelled at her request to Perth to live with her and her second husband, a plumber named Arthur \\"Bill\\" Downie at Subiaco. However, he only stayed a short time before accepting work back in rural Western Australia. Thereafter Facey and his mother saw each other sporadically until she died suddenly in September 1914, aged 51. His childhood in Western Australia was spent in areas such as Kalgoorlie, Narrogin, Bruce Rock, Merredin, Yealering, Wickepin, Pingelly, and at Cave Rock, near Popanyinning, which he writes about in Chapter 2 of A Fortunate Life. By the age of 14 he was an experienced farm labourer and bushman, and at 20 he became a professional boxer with a troupe that toured South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. His boxing career continued until he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in January 1915. War service Facey joined the AIF on 4 January 1915, not long after the outbreak of the First World War. He travelled to Egypt as an infantryman with the 11th Battalion, 3rd Reinforcement, aboard the troopship and fought during the Gallipoli Campaign, including the battle of Leane's Trench. Much of his autobiography relates to the horror he endured during his wartime service and his vivid recollections of the plight of the ANZAC Diggers at Gallipoli. Two of his older brothers, Roy Barker Facey (1890‚Äì1915) and Joseph Thomas Facey (1883‚Äì1915) were killed during the campaign. Facey tells in his book of being wounded on more than one occasion at Gallipoli. This culminated on 19 August 1915although Facey \\"was uncertain about dates\\"when a shell exploded near him and he received severe internal injuries and wounds to his leg. However, his war records show no evidence of being wounded, only of heart trouble. While records make no mention of any ordnance exploding near any 11th Battalion troops on (or about) 19 Augustit was quiet, after a week in reserve the 11th Battalion was redistributed between the 9th and 10th Battalions at Anzac on 18 August. Facey was invalided back to Australia on the ship on 31 October 1915. Family life and career =Marriage= Albert Facey's house in Wickepin was moved into town and is now a tourist attraction After being returned to Australia, Facey met Evelyn Mary Gibson (1897‚Äì1976), whom he married at Bunbury on 24 August 1916. They were happily married for nearly 60 years before Evelyn died on 3 August 1976. He mourned her for the rest of his life. The couple had seven children, born between 1919 and 1939. Facey became an active public campaigner for improved conditions for Australian returned servicemen. The family lived at Victoria Park, before returning with their children to farm at Wickepin, from 1922 to 1934. After he returned from the war, Facey worked as a tram driver (1916‚Äì1922), and on his return from Wickepin, as a trolleybus driver (1934‚Äì1946) in Perth. He then spent the rest of his working life as a successful self-employed poultry and pig farmer and businessman (1947‚Äì1958) in areas such as Tuart Hill, Wanneroo, Gosnells and Mount Helena near Mundaring. Facey was active in public life and known in his community from the 1920s until he retired in the late 1950s. He was president of the Perth Tramways Union for five years and later an elected member of local government and the Perth Roads Board for over 20 years, and a justice of the peace. =Loss of son= Facey's eldest son, also named Albert Barnett Facey and known as Barney, 1919‚Äì1942, joined the Second AIF during the Second World War and served with the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion. He died in a bombing raid on 15 March 1942, during the Battle of Singapore against the Japanese Army. While his family were aware that he was missing in action, his death was not confirmed until May 1945. Facey stated in his memoirs that although he and his wife had assumed their son had been killed, they had not given up hope. After that wait of over three years, his wife's health deteriorated to such an extent that she suffered a major stroke. Two other sons, Joseph and George, also served in the Australian Army in World War II, both seeing action in New Guinea. They returned home safely at the end of 1945. =Later health= Facey attributed his later health issues to war- related injuries received at Gallipoli, including old bullet wounds and a ruptured spleen, although his war records show no evidence of being injured in his WWI service at all. He arrived at Gallipoli on 7 May 1915, after which the only issue to his health was tachycardia, diagnosed as heart trouble at Gallipoli on 19 August and the reason for his evacuation back to Australia in October 1915. He did not re-enlist. Facey suffered a major heart attack in 1958 (aged 64), and retired. =Memoirs and fame= Facey began making notes on his life, and at the urging of his wife and children, eventually had the notes printed into a book. He completed his memoirs on his 83rd birthday, in 1977. Two years later, at 85, he learnt that his autobiography, A Fortunate Life, had been approved for publication. It was published in 1981, just nine months before his death. Although Facey was delighted that his life story was appreciated on such a grand scale, his health was rapidly declining and he was losing his eyesight. He also needed a wheelchair due to a broken hip. His book became a bestseller and won New South Wales Premier's Literary Award for non- fiction and the National Book Council Prize. During the final six months of his life, Facey became a national celebrity and was nominated for the Australian of the Year award in 1981. Death While in an Aged Care Facility with his broken hip, Facey died of natural causes at Midland on 11 February 1982, aged 87. His body was buried at the local Midland Cemetery. He was survived by six of his seven children and his 28 grandchildren. Television adaptation Albert Facey House in Forrest Place, Perth is named after Facey His novel of A Fortunate Life was made into a four-part television film in 1985, based on Facey's life between 1897 and 1916. The cast included Bill Hunter, Val Lehman and Ray Meagher. Mundaring Legacy Facey's homestead in Wickepin was turned into a tourist attraction. A government building named Albert Facey House on Forrest Place in Perth was named in his honour ‚Äì it houses the Public Utilities Office of the Department of Finance and other agencies. His name is also borne by the Albert Facey Memorial Library in Mundaring, Facey Road in Gnangara, Albert Facey Street in Maidstone, Barney Street in Glendalough (named after his late son), and a motel in Narrogin. The manuscripts of A Fortunate Life are housed in the Special Collections in the University of Western Australia Library.

Between 2010 and 2011 she served as Undersecretary to the Ministry for the Implementation of the Government Program in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet. Studies and personal life Christened Daniela Garnero, Santanch√® was born in Cuneo, Piedmont. She moved to Turin to study political science, and at 21 married Paolo Santanch√®, a plastic surgeon. She was employed by his company in an administrative role. After studying political science, in 1983 she founded a company that focused on marketing. She later acquired shares of the Billionaire company, along with Flavio Briatore, Lele Mora, Paolo Brosio and Marcello Lippi. In 1995, she left her husband, Paolo Santanch√®, and began a relationship with Canio Mazzaro, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur from Potenza. Her marriage to Paolo Santanch√® was declared void by the Roman Rota. In politics she has continued to use the Santanch√® surname, despite an unsuccessful court case by her ex-husband to try to stop her. Her current partner is the journalist Alessandro Sallusti, editor of il Giornale, a daily newspaper owned by Paolo Berlusconi and Vittorio Feltri. Local politics with Alleanza Nazionale In the 1990s, Santanch√® became an assistant of Ignazio La Russa, and in 1995 joined the right-wing National Alliance. Santanch√® worked as a consultant for the Milan Municipality Board led by Gabriele Albertini, and in June 1999 was elected councillor of the Council of the Province of Milan. In 2001, Santanch√® unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, but instead took up a seat vacated by her colleague Viviana Beccalossi. From 2003 to June 2004, Santanch√® served as assessor of the Municipality of Ragalna, a town in the province of Catania, dealing with sports and events. National politics with Alleanza Nazionale Santanch√® held the position of chief of the department for equal opportunity for the National Alliance from 2005 to 2007. In 2005, Santanch√® was harshly criticised when she showed her middle finger, in a gesture of insult, towards a student protest against the Moratti school reform. Daniela Santanch√® risponde con un dito medio alzato ai contestatori fuori Montecitorio Raggiunta telefonicamente da Corriere.it sulla vicenda del dito medio In 2005, Santanch√® was nominated to hold the discussion of the annual Financial Law, the first woman in Italian history in such a role. In 2006, she was re-elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies with National Alliance in the constituency of Milan. On 22 October 2006, while she was participating in a live show, \\"Controcorrente\\", to discuss matters regarding the Islamic veil, Santanch√® was criticized by the Imam of Segrate. The prefect of Milan stated that her safety was at risk and he would consider the possibility of taking security measures to protect her.Police protection for Daniela Santanch√® La Destra (2008) More than a year later, on 10 November 2007, Daniela Santanch√® resigned from the National Alliance party to join Francesco Storace's new party The Right. The same day, she was appointed official speaker for the party La Santanch√® lascia An e va con Storace, 27-12-2007, Corriere della Sera Santanch√® was then the Prime Minister candidate for The Right in the 2008 Italian general election. Along with Flavia D'Angeli (Critical Left) and Fabiana Stefanoni (Communist Alternative Party), she was the first woman to be a candidate for Italian prime minister. The Right did not acquire the necessary share of votes (4% for the Chamber, 8% for the Senate) to enter the Parliament and Daniela Santanch√® therefore ended her parliamentary mandate. After seven years as deputy, she received ‚Ç¨65,534 as termination indemnities (trattamento di fine rapporto), and ‚Ç¨3,605 monthly as lifetime allowance. Francesca Schianchi, L'espresso n. 17, 1¬∞ May 2008, page 66 She declared that she will donate this to charity. Movimento per l'Italia (2008‚Äì10) On 28 September 2008, after arguing with party secretary Francesco Storace, Santanch√® left the party. Shortly afterwards, with Diego Zarneri and other former La Destra politicians, she founded the Movement for Italy (MpI) political movement, in order to come closer to Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom. On 20 September 2009, she appeared with Diego Zarneri at the Eid ul-Fitr religious holiday in Milan. According to Muslims, Santanch√® tried to unveil some women, causing a reaction by local men. In her version, Santanch√® says she asked the police to apply Italian law, which bans appearing in public with a veil, and that she made no contact with a Muslim woman. Afterwards, she declared she had been assaulted and beaten, but this was denied by Muslim eyewitnesses. At the hospital, she was examined and found to have chest bruises, that would take 20 days to heal. On 25 September on the il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper, a short video shot by peacereporter seems to disprove any alleged assault on Santanch√®. In the video, Santanch√® is shown trying to cross the police barrier, while no assault on her is shown. Peace Reporter Santanch√®'s lawyers dismissed the video as a fabrication, releasing a copy of the reports by the hospital and by the police.

Retrieved 2013-08-24. stating that although on her resume Santanch√® claimed to have an MBA from the Bocconi University, the university itself had no record of having awarded her any such degree. Santanch√® did not resign, claimed she was telling the truth and threatened to sue the magazine for libel. No evidence of her degree has turned up, although it appears that she did attend another, unspecified, course at the university.

Along with Sim√≥n Iturri Pati√±o and Carlos V√≠ctor Aramayo, one of the three so-called Bolivian tin barons. Additionally, he saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust by facilitating their legal admission to Bolivia. Early life Hochschild was born in Biblis, Germany, into a Jewish family which had already been active in the mining industry for over a generation. He was the eldest son of a general trader who had two cousins involved in the metal industry: brothers Berthold Hochschild, who founded the American Metal Company and Zachary Hochschild, a partner in Metallgesellschaft. After Hochschild graduated from school, he studied mining and engineering at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. He was agnostic. Career In 1905, he began his career in the field at the large industrial conglomerate Metallgesellschaft. and then as the company's agent in Spain and Australia and then finally moved to South America to work independently. After several years in Chile, he returned to Germany and stayed there until the end of the first World War. In 1918, he married K√§the Rosenbaum and in 1920, he returned once again to Bolivia. In 1920, his son, Gerardo Hochschild Rosenbaum, was born; his wife died in 1924. Known as Don Mauricio in South America, Hochschild built up an economic empire in Bolivia during the following two decades around the mining and trade of tin ore. His empire stretched from Peru to Chile. During this period of growth, more of his family followed him to South America to work for him, including his cousin Philipp Hochschild and Philipp's wife Germaine. Moritz and Germaine had an affair, and they married after Germaine divorced Philipp. The 1930s saw the peak of the Moritz Hochschild Group's economical and political influence. In 1938, using his influence with German Busch, Bolivia's military president from 1937 to 1939, Hochschild pushed Bolivia to open its doors to Jewish refugees from Hitler's Germany. An estimated 9,000 were admitted. Hochschild also funded the transport of the refugees and their housing once they arrived in the South American country. Mass media outlets have called him \\"Bolivia's Schindler.\\" In both 1939 and 1944, Hochschild was arrested by the Bolivian government and sentenced to death. Just two weeks after his release following his 1944 arrest, he was captured and held by kidnappers for two weeks. After he was freed he left Bolivia, never to return. In 1951, the Hochschilds donated the majority of their fortune to the Hochschild Trust and Foundation. In the following year, the Moritz Hochschild Group was nationalized during the Bolivian National Revolution; however, they were compensated with an allotment of 30% of the company's prior assets. The company, Hochschild Mining, grew further and expanded worldwide. In 1961 Hochschild inaugurated Mantos Blancos copper mine in Antofagasta, Chile, which became his most successful mining operation, although its best results were to come after his death. Holocaust savior Hochschild has been being called the \\"Bolivian Schindler,\\" after it was discovered that the Bolivian business tycoon with facilitated the escape of at least 9,000 Jews from Nazi Germany. It is now believed that he had strong connections with the Nazi resistance movement, despite being vilified in his time. Final years Moritz Hochschild died in 1965 in Paris. He is the great uncle of billionaire Eduardo Hochschild, who is now the Chairman of Hochschild Mining PLC.

Achievements In 2012, the tiny township was selected as the Most Outstanding Community in New South Wales and the ACT (with a population of 15,000 or less) in a competition organised by Prime7. =Airstrip= The town sealed its local airstrip, installed kangaroo- proof fences around the perimeter, and put in night lighting, with half of the costs coming from private donations. Locals had been upset that the Royal Flying Doctor Service had not been able to land there for a medical emergency involving one of the leading members of the local population. =Medical and other services= The town also successfully searched the world to recruit its own doctor, when the Health Department had said that no suitable doctor could be found. Five locals came forward to form a team of local volunteer ambulance officers, in support of the one full-time paramedic that is provided by the NSW Ambulance Service. Finally, the town constructed a spacious sports centre in a dollar for dollar agreement with the local Shire.

Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine in AllMusic remarked: \\"Universal is a rote collection of synth-pop and dance-pop from OMD, demonstrating only a fraction of the sophisticated craft that made its predecessor Liberator enjoyable, and none of the adventurous spirit of their '80s records.\\" Trouser Press wrote that \\"the album quickly settles into the type of pop OMD has offered since [1985's] Crush\\" and is \\"enjoyable enough for what it is\\".

A kayaker wearing a tuiliusaq (modern neoprene tuilik), in the starting position for a siukkut tunusummillugu rolling exercise. A tuilik is an Inuit watertight jacket, used when paddling a kayak. It is sealed at the face, at the wrists and around the cockpit coaming. In this way the paddler can capsize and come back upright (using an Eskimo Rescue or kayak roll) without getting wet, and without getting any water into the kayak. The air trapped in a tuilik makes rolling easier. If the paddler comes out of their kayak, a tuilik provides considerable initial buoyancy, and the legs may be drawn up into the air pocket.Tuiliks (tuillit) and Kayak Clothing PFDs may be worn over or under a tuilik or tuiliusaq. In summer months an akuilisaq (a spray skirt or spray deck) may be used instead. Many kayakers do not use a tuilik, but instead a separate spray skirt and kayaking top (often a drytop, something like a drysuit jacket), which usually seals around the waist, arms, and neck. A tuilik integrates the skirt and top into one piece of clothing, with a hood-edge seal rather than a neck seal. Tuiliks are generally less restrictive of motion, but the fit is finnickier. Fit A hunter in 1891 wearing a sealskin tuilik with a traditional narrow fit. The hood must fit snugly, but the arms and body fit loosely to allow free movement and clothing underneath. Rolling requires extra length in the torso. Quick-release suspenders were traditionally used to lift the front and prevent water from pooling in the excess length.Chapter Four: Building the Kayaks The tuilik must seal at the face and kayak cockpit coaming, and usually at the wrists (unless there are integrated mittens, as in the tuilikusaq image above). Traditional tuiliks are narrower, to fit narrow custom-fitted cockpits; mass-produced kayaks have larger cockpits (including long keyhole cockpits) and the tuilik must therefore be wider at the hem. Some tuiliks are made with double decks to fit a range of cockpits.Reed Tuiliqs Commercial tuiliks may be custom-fitted or made in a broad range of off-the-peg shapes and sizes (one manufacturer stocks 15 sizes). Materials and manufacture Yup'ik language of the Yup'ik and Cup'ik). Traditionally, a tuilik can be made from specially-prepared seal-skin, sewn with sinew, with draw-string seals. A sealskin tuilik is soaked, stretched, rubbed, and greased to keep it soft and waterproof. Garments to seal a person to a kayak coaming can also be made of gut.Yuungnaqpiallerput : Pissurcuutet Imarpigmi = Tools for Ocean Hunting Gut tuiliks are made of the intestines of sea mammals or bears.Reed, Fran (2008). \\"Embellishments of the Alaska Native gut parka\\". Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings, Paper 127. The gut is turned inside-out to clean both sides, then inflated to dry. Inflated gut dries quickly. If it is dried in cold, dark, windy weather, it becomes opaque and white, and is known as \\"winter gut\\". \\"Summer gut\\" is yellowish and transparent, and stiffer. The gut is then slit open lengthwise and the strips are sewn into a garment. The smoother inside of the gut becomes the outside of the garment.Yuungnaqpiallerput : Imarpigmiutarnek Piliat = Things Made from Sea Mammals Modern tuiliks made from neoprene are called tuiliusaq (tuilik- like).\\"Tuiliks: Versatile garments with variety\\", by Shawn Baker. \\"Masik\\", Fall 2003: Volume 1, Issue 3, p.14 Neoprene tuiliusaqs provide buoyancy and good insulation against the cold. This makes them feel quite unlike a sealskin tuilik. Thinner materials feel more like the traditional sealskin. Some tuiliks have been made of cotton canvas. They are also made from waterproof, breathable laminate fabrics similar to those used for rain jackets.Clothing & tow-belt (1) Some now use polyurethane laminate fabrics (including fleeces), which are less warm and buoyant than neoprene.Brooks Tuilik v Reed Tuiliq the great debate However, PUL is somewhat stretchy, less bulky and more durable,Thermal stretch materials and works better over a drysuit. Teflon laminate fabrics are also used. Seams are avoided in areas where their bulk would make the tuilik stiff or cause water to pool, such as on top of the shoulders. One Greenlandic traditional cut has a front which wraps yoke-like over the shoulder, dropped sleeves, a seam along each sleeve in line with the thumb, two vertical side seams, and a hood seam around the front and side base of the neck (the hood is cut in one piece with the back).Greenland National Championchips Sisimuit 2006 See lead illustration. =Seals= The tuilik must seal reasonably at the face and kayak cockpit coaming, and usually at the wrists. This is done using smooth, stretchy, grippy materials. Both laminate fabrics and neoprene will seal, but stretchier neoprene often seals better, so some non-neoprene tuiliks have neoprene rands.Making A Chris Cunningham Tuilik: A southern hemisphere interpretation, by Pete Notman and Tony Calvert. \\"Masik\\", Winter 2005, Volume 3, Number 1 Stretchier neoprene with one smooth side may grip and seal better, so even neoprene tuilikusaqs may use a different neoprene for the seals.Making a Tuilik, Akuilisaq, & Cockpit Cover, by Dana Rutherford \\"Masik\\", Spring/Summer 2010. Volume 2, p.28Making a neoprene TuilikTuilik Making Page 1 Elastic cords (including leather thongs), and sometimes velcro straps, are used to keep the seals in place. The hood edge must seal to the face, and usually has a draw-cord that wraps 1.3 times around the hood opening, with the cord doubled at the top and exiting the casing through holes near the ends of the wearer's eyebrows before tying adjustably behind the head. The entire hood may be made of stretchier materials for a closer fit. Any cuffs must be at least fairly water-tight. Cuffs may therefore may be made of neoprene (like the hood edge) or dry-suit wrist seals (which can be made of silicone rubber, or latex rubber similar to that used in bicycle inner tubes).

The United States Christian Commission (USCC) was an organization that furnished supplies, medical services, and religious literature to Union troops during the American Civil War. It combined religious support with social services and recreational activities. It supplied Protestant chaplains and social workers and collaborated with the U.S. Sanitary Commission in providing medical services. The Christian Commission was created in response to what the troops suffered in the First Battle of Bull Run. On November 14, 1861, the National Committee of the YMCA called a convention which met in New York City. Leaders outlined the work needed to support the soldiers, the design for the United States Christian Commission, whose organization was completed next day. Two of the founding members were Vincent Colyer, who was appalled by the aftermath of the battle of Bull Run, and George Stuart, a well-to-do businessman. The YMCA and Protestant ministers formed the USCC. Its five thousand volunteers (\\"delegates\\") included seminary students, but many were just concerned Christians. As civilians on the battlefield, they did not carry weapons. They distributed more than $6 million worth of goods and supplies in hospitals, camps, prisons and battlefields.Stories of the U.S. Christian Commission, Faith at Gettysburg, accessed 3 Mar 2009 The original plan of the USCC was to help the clergy of the armed services in their daily work, as the chaplaincy program was in its infancy, with only some 30 members, who were quickly overwhelmed by the scale of battles and casualties, and especially by the rapidly increasing number of deaths due to wounds and more so to disease. John Calhoun Chamberlain, brother of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Thomas Chamberlain, heroes of Little Round Top, served with the USCC during the Battle of Gettysburg. During the evening of July 2, John assisted at the medical field station set up for his brothers' regiment, the 20th Maine. John filed a report to the central office, describing the activities of the USCC at Gettysburg. This report is found in Chamberlain's Christian Commission diary, kept during the battle of Gettysburg and is recorded in Edinborough Press' book, Gettysburg and the Christian Commission. Women also participated. A national movement started in May 1864 with a view to organizing a Ladies Christian Commission in each evangelical congregation of the North as an auxiliary to the USCC. Increasing the network of collection, fundraising and support was the way the organization responded to meet a growing demand to serve the soldiers.Official U.S. Christian Commission website, accessed 3 Mar 2009 Annie Wittenmyer led dozens of female \\"lady managers\\" including Mary and Amanda Shelton, to begin diet kitchens in hospitals in the field to help reduce deaths related to poor quality diet in hospitals. The USCC continued to grow. More than three-quarters of the value of what it collected was distributed during 1864 and the four months of 1865. It represented both citizens' recognition of need and a more efficient organization. The Ladies Christian Commission (LCC) played a critical role in this success.Official U.S. Christian Commission website, accessed 3 Mar 2009 Louisa May Alcott was among many women who worked with the Commission. Others included Georgia McClellan, the sister of Jenny Wade, the only civilian killed during the Battle of Gettysburg, and Sarah Emma Edmonds, who worked as a nurse after serving with the Union Army as a soldier, spy, and as a male nurse under the name \\"Franklin Thompson.\\" According to an 1868 account, 45 men and 3 women members of the U.S.C.C. died during the Civil War.\\"The Annals of the United States Christian Commission\\" by the Rev.

The area lies east of the River Ness. The most prominent structure in the vicinity is the Holm Mills. The mill is known for its contribution to the Caledonian Canal, by weaving a cloth to prevent the embankments from leaking. Until recently, tartan was still being woven in the original building. The premises are now a shop and visitor centre. A building occupied by Dick Precast Concrete is situated slightly south of Holm Mills. Additionally a large electrical substation is sited on Dores Road and this facility serves most of Inverness. Local Services, Public Transport and Upcoming Developments On Dores Road there is a small convenience shop which includes Royal Mail Post Office facilities. As is the case in the rest of the City, a bus service is provided by Stagecoach. Buses to & from the City centre run approximately every 30 minutes Monday to Saturday and hourly on Sundays. Dores Road at Holm will soon be the site of the City's 4th Tesco store along with associated facilities. Building work began on Monday 7 March 2011. The company forecasts a construction period of 4 months, with the new superstore opening in July. As well as the main shop the site will include a filling station & car wash, GP surgery, community centre, 4 smaller retail units and a public square. There will be over 250 car parking spaces and the development is to be landscaped to include trees and green spaces, with a view to maintaining the current appearance of the area.

It ran in various forms from 1933 until 1983, though the Express designation was lost in 1956 and later incarnations did not operate at night and terminated in Taumarunui rather than Auckland. The New Plymouth Night Express should not be confused with the New Plymouth Express that operated between New Plymouth and Wellington.  Introduction  In 1933, the Stratford‚ÄìOkahukura Line was completed, providing a rail link through northern Taranaki between the Marton - New Plymouth Line and the North Island Main Trunk Railway. On 4 September 1933, the new line's ownership was handed over to NZR from the New Zealand Ministry of Works, and early that morning, the first passenger service was operated. This inaugural service left Auckland at 7pm on 3 September 1933 attached to the Night Limited, and it consisted of one first class carriage, one second class carriage, a sleeping car, and a guard's van. In Taumarunui, these carriages were detached from the Night Limited, as it was to continue to Wellington, and ran as a separate train to New Plymouth, departing Taumarunui at 12:45 am and arriving in New Plymouth just after 6 am. The return working left New Plymouth at 7:10 pm, connected with the Night Limited in Taumarunui, and was conveyed back to Auckland by the Limited for a 7:10 am arrival.  Operation  Joint running with the Night Limited for the Tauramunui-Auckland leg was the pattern for the 1930s, with the service provided thrice weekly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. AB class steam locomotives were typical motive power at this stage, and a train from Hawera connected with the Express in Stratford. At holiday times, the New Plymouth Night Express was run separately from the Night Limited due to large volumes of passengers, and as this service ran directly between New Plymouth and Auckland, it did not pass through Taumarunui, which is seven miles to the south of the junction in Okahukura; accordingly, a connecting train ran between Taumarunui and Okahukura. In 1940, the independent service began operating thrice weekly year-round. It departed Auckland at 7:50pm on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, made refreshment stops in Frankton and Taumarunui as NZR did not operate dining cars at this point in history, and arrived in New Plymouth at 7:19 am the next morning. The opposite working left New Plymouth at 7:08pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, made the same refreshment stops, and arrived in Auckland at 6:30 am the next morning. Operating through to Taumarunui removed the need for a connecting train between Taumarunui and Okahukura, but it did mean the front of the train at the start of the journey became the back for the second leg and the seats were reversed. Sleeping car facilities were removed in 1944 due to restrictions caused by World War II, and by 1950, the train ran only twice weekly due to coal shortages. At this stage, J class locomotives had become the primary motive power and the train typically comprised two first class carriages, three second class carriages, and a guard's van.  Replacement by railcars  The actual New Plymouth Night Express ceased to operate in 1956. RM class 88 seater railcars had recently been introduced to New Zealand and they provided a more economical service, so they replaced the carriage train. They offered a more regular daily service on a quicker timetable but continued the Expresss pattern of operating at night. The southbound service arrived in New Plymouth at 11:23 pm and departed for Auckland at 2:34 am. There was some speculation that the service was originally intended to only operate between Auckland and Taumarunui and its late running to New Plymouth was a result of this run being extended, but as it turned out, this section of the run was cancelled in 1971 and the railcars operated solely between New Plymouth and Taumarunui. Soon after this change, the service was altered to a daytime run in December 1973, with a departure from New Plymouth at 8:30 am and the return service leaving Taumarunui at 3:10 pm.  Return and demise of carriage trains  The new daytime service proved more popular with the local population and allowed mixed trains to cease to operate along the route from 1 December 1975. The 88 seater railcars were mechanically deteriorating by this stage and last operated on 11 February 1978, but unlike most other provincial railcar services, the New Plymouth- Taumarunui run was not outright cancelled. There was sufficient traffic to justify a replacement carriage train, and its consist initially comprised carriages made from de-motorised 88 seater railcars; these carriages were known as \\"grassgrubs\\" in New Zealand railfan jargon due to their paint scheme. However, the railcars were not designed to be hauled as carriages and were soon replaced by ordinary passenger carriages. Around this time, roads through the isolated area served by the train were improved, and as locals turned to the private car in greater numbers, NZR was no longer prepared to incur losses from the service. It last operated on 21 January 1983.
