Its common names include oleander aphid, milkweed aphid, sweet pepper aphid, and nerium aphid. Distribution The oleander aphid is widespread in regions with tropical and Mediterranean climates. In Poland, oleander aphid has only been reported from a glasshouse. Small populations of oleander aphid are present in gardens in London, England. Lifecycle Female aphids lay live young (nymphs), a process known as viviparity. Female aphids reproduce by parthenogenesis, males have never been observed in the wild but have been produced under laboratory conditions. Females may be wingless or winged (alate), the production of the alate form occurs a higher rate in those regions where it is necessary for oleander aphid to migrate each year on to temporary hosts. Oleander aphid has a wide range of hosts, but mainly feeds on plants in the dogbane family, including milkweeds, oleander and periwinkle. It is occasionally recorded feeding on plants in the bindweed family, daisy family and spurge family as well as rarely being recorded on Citrus. Virus Vector Oleander aphid can act as a vector of viruses in the genus Potyvirus and Cucumovirus. The following viruses are known to be vectored by oleander aphid: *Araujia mosaic virus *Bean yellow mosaic virus *Bittergourd mosaic virus *Citrus tristeza virus *Cucumber mosaic virus *Lentil mosaic virus *Papaya ringspot virus *Tobacco etch virus *Watermelon mosaic virus *Zucchini yellow mosaic virus Photos File:Aphis-nerii.jpg|Colony on Nerium oleander File:IMG 1437.w.jpg|Colony on Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed) File:IMG 5995.w.jpg|Colony on Asclepias syriaca inflorescence File:Aphis nerii parasitized.jpg|Mummified aphids, parasitized by Aphidiinae wasp, probably Lysiphlebus References nerii Category:Insects described in 1841 Category:Taxa named by √âtienne Laurent Joseph Hippolyte Boyer de Fonscolombe ","title":"Aphis nerii"},{"id":"43325855","text":"Stanka Gjuriƒá (; born 20 January 1956) is a Croatian poet, essayist, actress, filmmaker and ex model.

The single-track electrified main line is part of the German Unity Transport Project () No. 1 (L√ºbeck‚ÄìRostock‚ÄìStralsund).  History  The railway line was built to provide a direct rail link between the two Hanseatic cities of Rostock and Stralsund and to open up the area in between. Prussia proposed a single-track main line, while Mecklenburg considered that a branch line would be sufficient. The concession was authorised by a treaty of 15 December 1884. The track was built by the Prussian state railways and officially opened on 1 July 1888. The Mecklenburg government participated only financially. The line crossed the boundary between the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Prussian province of Pomerania between Ribnitz and Damgarten. The original plan was that the Stralsund‚ÄìRibnitz section would run via Barth. This section had been surveyed. However, the shorter connection via Velgast was selected to reduce the construction costs. The management of operations on Prussian territory, that is from Stralsund to Damgarten, was initially carried out by the Prussian state railways, while operations on the section through Mecklenburg were carried out by the Friedrich-Franz Railway. The necessary locomotives exchange took place in Ribnitz station (now Ribnitz-Damgarten West). After the maintenance of the Prussian locomotives in Rostock in Mecklenburg had been agreed under an international treaty, the operations were completely taken over by the Prussian state railways. Passenger services on the line ended at the station of the Friedrich-Franz Railway in the southeast of Rostock‚Äôs old town, which was later used as a freight yard. A direct connection to Rostock Hauptbahnhof was opened in 1905. During the following years more branch lines developed along the line. Thus, connections were gradually built to Prerow via Barth (the Dar√ü Railway of the Prussian state railways), to Tribsees (the Velgast‚ÄìTribsees/Franzburg railway) and Graal- M√ºritz (the R√∂vershagen‚ÄìGraal-M√ºritz railway). As a result of the construction of these branch lines the stations of R√∂vershagen and Velgast developed into railway junction. Velgast station gained special importance with the building of the branches to Prerow and Tribsees. The line initially built as a branch line was declared to be a main line in 1926. =1950‚Äì1989 = During the period of the German Democratic Republic, the line was connected to many military and business sidings. In the late 1950s a branch was built to the north of the line to the north port of Rostock with a link towards Rostock and towards Bentwisch on the line to Stralsund. The other major connection was the industrial railway to the fertilizer plant at Poppendorf. The military sidings connected from Ribnitz-Damgarten Ost to P√ºtnitz (airfield) and from Gelbensande to Schwarzenpfost, running for a few metres parallel and adjacent to the main line through the woods. Also the fiberboard plant in Ribnitz was connected with a works railway. The line was progressively electrificatied in the following stages from 1985: #Rostock Hauptbahnhof‚ÄìRostock freight yard: 15 December 1985 #Riekdahl‚ÄìBentwisch: 12 April 1986 #Bentwisch‚ÄìPoppendorf: 30 May 1986 #Bentwisch‚ÄìStralsund: 2 June 1991. The last scheduled steam train ran on this line on 29 March 1985. =1990‚Äì2010 = Construction work in Gelbensande station After Die Wende in 1989, many sidings and stations were closed and later partly dismantled (such as Rostock freight yard). The sidings for the military trains of the National People‚Äôs Army were no longer needed and have been completely dismantled, the stations of Schwarzenpfost, Altheide, Langenhanshagen, Starkov and Pantelitz have not been served since 1996. In addition the last local freight train operated in 1996. In 1999, the section between Ribnitz-Damgarten West and Stralsund was completely renovated. The appearance of the stations on the track changed greatly. The signal boxes were replaced by a new electronic interlocking in Velgast. Consequently, all signal boxes that were no longer needed and freight sidings were demolished and the interlocking equipment that was housed in the old station buildings was removed. The remaining buildings are largely empty, and have been secured against unauthorised entry. The closed stations were completely demolished in the course of the renovation. But, after the renovation of the track, a new station was opened in Stralsund Gr√ºnhufe. The redevelopment of the remainder of the section between Rostock and Ribnitz-Damgarten West was begun, but has been repeatedly deferred. As a result, almost all of the line on this section has not been upgraded. All stations are still manned and the line is protected by signals controlled by relay interlocking at local signal boxes. During the line upgrade, the track in the section between Rostock and Ribnitz‚ÄìDamgarten West was to be doubled because of the current high train density. A second track was also planned on the Velgast‚ÄìStralsund section. All culverts and bridges were already designed for a second track in 1999. After the outcome of the review of the demand plan for federal railway infrastructure of 11 November 2010, it was decided not to pursue the project because of its unfavourable benefit-cost ratio. =Construction = In March 2007, the first works were carried out for upgrading the Rostock‚ÄìRibnitz-Damgarten West section to be operated at 160 km/h. Substantial work was especially carried out in the stations of Bentwisch, Gelbensande and Ribnitz-Damgarten West. Further work took place in the spring of 2008. Additional platforms were restored along the line and refuge tracks and freight tracks were removed in stations. The western section was not initially connected to the electronic interlocking at Velgast. Passenger services =Regional services= Class 143 with double-deck carriages near Ribnitz-Damgarten Ost Deutschen Bahn Stadler FLIRT railcars running as the Hanse-Express Regional services operate on the line at two-hour intervals between the two cities. Since December 2007, these have been operated using Stadler FLIRT railcars, which, because of their greater acceleration and higher speed, have reduced travel time on some sections. Before the introduction of the new railcars, trains often consisted of three double-decker cars hauled by a class 143 locomotive. On the Rostock‚ÄìR√∂vershagen section there is an additional hourly direct train to Graal-M√ºritz. For this reason, the stations of Rostock-Kassebohm, Bentwisch and M√∂nchhagen are not generally served by Regional-Express trains towards Stralsund. Railcars of class 642 (Siemens Desiro) or class 628 are used towards Graal-M√ºritz. Every two hours Usedomer B√§derbahn (UBB) trains operated between Stralsund and Velgast using class 646 railcars until 2017. They continued on the UBB network to Barth. Since they now run only between Velgast and Barth, although approximately hourly, Kummerow (b Stralsund) station is no longer served by any trains. =Long-distance services = An IC train near Ribnitz-Damgarten The line is served several times a day by long-distance trains. The Intercity trains stop at the stations of Rostock Hauptbahnhof, Ribnitz-Damgarten West, Velgast and Stralsund Hauptbahnhof. Several trains continue from Stralsund to Ostseebad Binz on R√ºgen. These continue to Hamburg and the Ruhr. Until October 2007, a night train operated from Stralsund to Munich and to the Ruhr. In the summer a train regularly runs on the route from Dortmund to Sassnitz, carrying vacationers from the Ruhr to the Baltic Sea. Another Intercity train runs as the UrlaubsExpress (Holiday Express) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern from Cologne via Hamburg, Rostock and Stralsund to the seaside resort of Heringsdorf on the island of Usedom. A special feature of the line is that all long-distance trains between Rostock and Stralsund may be used with local public transport tickets. This excludes the so-called L√§ndertickets and Sch√∂ne-Wochenende-Tickets. Since the timetable change in 2005, there are no longer any strictly two-hour intervals services on the line. The reason for this was the only way to shorten the times taken by the long-distance trains to Hamburg. In order to speed up regional services and to offer the long-demanded trains from Rostock to R√ºgen, it was necessary for the long-distance trains to stop at crossing station to wait for regional services. Freight traffic The line is used for regional freight traffic, but it is also important for interregional traffic. So the big freight yards of Rostock Seehafen (seaport) and Sassnitz-Mukran on R√ºgen are served by freight traffic on the line. There are also two works sidings on the line that can be served. The biggest works sidings is the fertilizer plant in Poppendorf. It has its own works station. For some time, sidings and a works station was operated at Yara Rostock. The other siding is located in R√∂vershagen where a local gas supplier is served.

His only published book, They Don't Dance Much (1940), is an early example of what Daniel Woodrell identifies as \\"country noir\\", or a noir novel with a rural setting. Life James Ross was born in rural Stanly County, North Carolina in 1911. He briefly worked as a writer for the Savannah Morning News and then for the Greensboro Daily News (now News & Record), covering North Carolina politics and legislation. He died in 1990. Ross's first novel was published in 1940. His follow-up novel, In The Red, was never published, and Ross turned to writing short fiction for magazines like Collier's, The Sewanee Review and Argosy. In 1970, he became a highly regarded literary agent, and 1975 saw the reissue of They Don‚Äôt Dance Much, which saw the book become truly popular for the first time. Mysterious Press - James Ross (with photograph) They Don't Dance Much The novel is set in a Western North Carolina roadhouse in the fictional crossroads town of Corinth. It is narrated by a failed farmer who, upon taking a job at a filling station, becomes involved in a murder. The novel, despite being praised by crime-fiction authors such as Raymond Chandler, William Gay, and Flannery O'Connor, has been largely forgotten. In part, this is due to its tumultuous publication history; since its release, the book has been printed by five different publishers, most recently by Mysterious Press.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background According to a report written by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), there are \\"three primary ways for a household to receive broadcast television signals: by using an individual antenna that receives broadcast signals directly over-the-air from a television station; by subscribing to a cable television service that brings a wire into the house that carries the retransmitted signals of broadcast stations; or by subscribing to a satellite television service that puts a dish on the roof that receives the retransmitted signals of broadcast stations.\\" The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA) was the latest in a series of laws regulating satellite television services. If STELA were to expire, the CRS projects that \\"approximately 1.5 million satellite television households would likely lose distant network broadcast signals.\\" Provisions of the bill The STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 amends the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA), to extend until December 31, 2019. = Extended Provisions = * An exemption from retransmission consent requirements for satellite operators for the carriage of distant network signals to ‚Äúunserved households‚Äù; * The prohibition on exclusive retransmission consent contracts; * Requirement that television broadcast stations and MVPDs negotiate in good faith. = New Provisions = * Prohibits joint retransmission consent negotiation by two or more independently owned broadcasters; * Eliminates the prohibition against changing broadcast signals during the quarterly sweeps; * Extends deadline to unwind joint sales agreements for which broadcasters seek a waiver and are found non-compliant under the FCC's attribution rules adopted on March 31, 2014; * Repeal of the FCC's integration ban for cable set-top boxes. Procedural history The STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 6, 2014 by Rep. Greg Walden (R, OR-2). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On July 11, 2014, it was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-518. The bill passed the House via voice vote on July 22, 2014.160 Cong. Rec. H6588, 2014 President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on December 4, 2014. Debate and discussion The bill was supported by 21st Century Fox, Disney‚ÄìABC Television Group, the American Cable Association, the American Television Alliance, CBS, DirecTV, and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) supported the bill. The organization's president, Gordon Smith, announced that \\"NAB thanks Chairmen Goodlatte and Coble for guiding through the House Judiciary Committee a sensible, non-controversial STELA reauthorization bill ensuring that satellite TV subscribers without access to local TV signals can continue receiving popular programming from broadcast TV networks. NAB strongly supports this practical approach to STELA.\\" The United States Cattlemen's Association (USCA) supported the bill because it \\"will help provide continued access to local news and broadcasting services in rural regions.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4572 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4572 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4572 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4572 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4572 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4572 *Reauthorization of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELA) - a Congressional Research Service report by Lennard G.

Acacia fulva grows as a shrub or tree, ranging anywhere from 1.5 to 15 m in height. Young trees have smooth grey- green bark, which darkens and becomes rough and fissured with age. New growth is covered in red-brown velvety hairs. The silver-grey leaves are pinnate, with 4-12 pairs of pinnae, each 3-7.5 cm long. Each pinna in turn is made up of 11 to 28 pairs of 3‚Äì10 mm-long pinnules. Flowering occurs from November till June, the yellow flowerheads arranged in axillary and terminal panicles or racemes. Each small round flower head is composed of 20 to 40 individual flowers. Flowering is followed by the development of the 2‚Äì12 cm-long leathery seed pods, which are ripe between April and November. Specimens of Acacia fulva were previously assigned to the species A. mollifolia until Mary Tindale described it as a separate species in 1966. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma fulvum in 2003 amongst debate over the best way to deal with Acacia sensu lato's polyphyletic definition. When the dust settled, Acacia had been restricted to Australian species, returning A. fulva to its original name. It is found on soils derived from sandstone and basalt that are high in nutrients. It grows in woodland, associated with such species as forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis), grey box (E. moluccana), and narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra), and shrubs such as dogwood (Jacksonia scoparia), Exocarpus, Clerodendrum, Clematis and Senecio.

Plot Al Lewis and Willy Clark are two old comedians who were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as \\"Lewis and Clark\\" and also called the Sunshine Boys. After 43 years together, they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then. A reunion is planned for a major network special on the history of comedy.

His teleplay updated the setting and made the two comedians the product of the early days of television, the medium in which the playwright got his start. Unlike the film adaptation, although they are portrayed as cantankerous, their animosity was not as severe as Matthau's and Burns' characters' bad relationship. Woody Allen was originally asked to direct the 1975 film adaptation The Sunshine Boys, but he was more interested in playing the role of Lewis and declined the offer. 20 years later he would be cast as Lewis in this television adaptation.

The Airport Security Enhancement Act of 2014 would direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security) of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) conduct outreach to all U.S. airports at which the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) performs, or oversees the implementation and performance of, security measures; and (2) give necessary technical assistance to verify that such airports have in place individualized working plans for responding to security incidents inside the airport perimeter, including active shooters, acts of terrorism, and incidents that target passenger-screening checkpoints. The bill would require the Assistant Secretary to: (1) identify best practices that exist across airports for security incident planning, management, and training; and (2) establish a mechanism through which to share those best practices with other airport operators nationwide. The bill would require the Assistant Secretary also to: (1) certify annually to specified congressional committees that all screening personnel have participated in practical training exercises for active shooter scenarios, and (2) analyze for those same committees how TSA can use cost savings achieved through efficiencies to increase over the next five fiscal years the funding available for checkpoint screening law enforcement support reimbursable agreements. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4802 would direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), to undertake a variety of activities aimed at enhancing security at airports where TSA performs or oversees security-related activities. The bill would require TSA to verify that all such airports have plans in place for responding to security threats and to provide technical assistance as necessary to improve such plans. H.R. 4802 also would require TSA to disseminate information on best practices for addressing security threats and ensure that all screening personnel have received training in how to handle potential shooting threats. Finally, H.R. 4802 would require the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs (DHS‚Äôs) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications to report to the Congress on the capacity of law enforcement, fire, and medical response teams to communicate and respond to security threats at airports. Based on information from DHS, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4802 would cost about $2.5 million in 2015, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Of that amount, CBO assumes the department would spend about $1.5 million to provide additional technical assistance to airports and about $1 million to evaluate the interoperability of communication systems used by emergency response teams. H.R. 4802 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4802 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 5, 2014 by Rep. Richard Hudson (R, NC-8). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security. On July 22, 2014, the House voted in a voice vote to pass the bill. Debate and discussion According to Rep. Hudson, who introduced the bill, its goal is to use \\"the lessons learned from last year's shooting at Los Angeles International Airport.\\" An after-action report evaluating the events of the 2013 LAX shooting found that \\"there was a lack of communication among airport officials, police, EMS and federal authorities\\" and that some of the airport's emergency equipment (such as panic buttons) did not work. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) supported the bill, saying \\"the safety and security of our nation's airports and all of the workers and travelers who pass through them is of paramount importance.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *List of airports in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4802 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4802 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4802 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4802 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4802 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Transportation Security Administration Category:Acts of the 114th United States Congress ","title":"Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2014"},{"id":"43326738","text":"The Jewish Community Center of Berkeley The Jewish Music Festival is an annual festival of Jewish music held in Berkeley, California, hosted by the Jewish Community Center of the East Bay.

Career Kingfisher was one of a number of small sloops and brigs purchased on the stocks while under construction during the American War of Independence. Though built at Rochester on the River Medway, It is uncertain which yard Kingfisher was purchased from. Greaves & Nicholson is one possibility. Her name is often given as King‚Äôs Fisher. Kingfisher was fitted at Chatham Dockyard, and commissioned for service in May 1783 under Commander William Albany Otway. Commander George Lumsdaine took over in November 1786, and was in turned superseded by Commander Henry Warre in April 1788. Kingfisher went on to serve under a succession of commanders during the last years of peace and the early years of the French Revolutionary War. Commander Charles Jones was captain from May 1791, succeeded by Commander William Brown in June 1792, and Brown in turn by Commander Thomas Graves in November that year. From April 1794 she was under Commander Thomas Gosselyn, though he was replaced by Commander Alexander Wilson in August 1795. Wilson's command was short-lived, in September Kingfisher was under Commander Edward Marsh, who took her out to the West Indies in March 1796, and then to the Lisbon station in January 1797. Marsh was soon superseded by Commander John Bligh, who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, and been rewarded with a promotion to commander on 8 March 1797 and the command of Kingfisher. While cruising off Oporto he was able to capture the 14-gun French privateer G√©n√©ral on 29 March. In April 1797 Commander John Maitland took command. On 1 August he was almost the victim of a mutiny. Taking a direct approach he gathered his officers and marines and attacked the mutineers with swords and cutlasses, killing and wounding several. This decisive action quashed the mutiny, and was approved of by his commanding officer, Admiral John Jervis. Jervis described Maitland's actions as 'Doctor Maitland's recipe', and advised that it should be adopted in future instances of attempted mutiny. Maitland was promoted to post-captain on 11 August 1797 and was given command of , one of the prizes captured by Nelson at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Before his transfer he had time to repeat Kingfishers success against privateers, capturing the 2-gun privateer Espoir on 15 September that year. Maitland was replaced by Commander Charles Pierrepoint, who had even more success. The 16-gun privateer Betsey was captured on 8 January 1798, followed by the 10-gun privateer Lynx on 15 March 1798. Also serving aboard Kingfisher at this time was Lieutenant Frederick Lewis Maitland. Maitland had gained a reputation for courage, so much so that the ship's company subscribed ¬£50 to present him with a sword. Disaster struck when Kingfisher was bilged on the Portuguese coast after running onto the Lisbon Bar while leaving the Tagus on 3 December 1798, and was lost. Maitland had been temporarily in command at the time, and faced a court-martial, which honourably acquitted him.

He became the first Longhorn quarterback to throw and run for over 100 yards in a bowl game; set the Cotton Bowl records for total offense and most rushing yards by a quarterback (which as of 2014 he still held); and rushed for more yards than any quarterback ever had in any prior bowl game, but it was not enough for the Longhorns to win. Texas fumbled the ball 9 times, with 5 of those being turnovers, and the Joe Theisman-led Fighting Irish beat Texas 24-11, giving a share of the national title to the Nebraska Cornhuskers. In 1971, Phillips was again the starter for Texas, but he had an injury plagued season and was replaced several times by back-up Donnie Wigginton. Phillips missed six games with injuries to his hamstring, ribs and shoulder. He was replaced by Wigginton in the first game of the season against UCLA after re-injuring his hamstring which he originally injured in August, and again with the same injury during his return against Oregon. He didn't play his first complete game of the season until facing Baylor in early November. But the next week he left the TCU game in the 3rd quarter with an injured shoulder. Despite his many injuries he was the starter in the 1972 Cotton Bowl classic against Penn State, in which he shared quarterback duties with backup Wigginton. Many saw the game as a grudge match between the two teams who went undefeated in 1969, and Penn State dominated in a 30-6 win to avenge their denial of the 1969 National Championship. Phillips played in the 1972 Hula Bowl. Phillips finished with a 14-2 record as a starter and, at the time he graduated, he'd had the four top rushing games by a quarterback in Texas history. He was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 2005.http://www.texassports.com/news/2005/11/1/110105aaa_727.aspx =Records= * UT - Highest Average Gain Per Pass Completion (min. 30 completions), season (17.8), surpassed by Randy McEachern in 1977 * UT - Longest run by a quarterback (63 yards), surpassed by Bret Stafford in 1985 * UT - Most rushing yards in a bowl game (164), surpassed by Ricky Williams in 1999 * UT - Most rushing yards by a Quarterback, game (164), broke his own record twice, surpassed by Marty Akins in 1974 * UT - Most rushing yards by a Quarterback, career (1,211), surpassed by Akins in 1974 * UT - Lowest Percentage of Passes Had Intercepted, season (3.1%), surpassed by Donnie Wigginton in 1971 * UT - Fewest passes had intercepted, career - min 150 attempts (8) * UT - Total Offense, game (363), surpassed by Donnie Little in 1980 * UT - Longest run by a quarterback in a bowl game (63 yards) * Cotton Bowl - Total Offense, game (363), surpassed by Graham Harrell in 2009 * Cotton Bowl - Net rushing yards by a quarterback (164) * Bowl - Net rushing yards by a quarterback (164), surpassed by Mike Mosley of Texas A&M; in the 1977 Bluebonnet Bowl Bowl means active Later life  Phillips was drafted in the 5th Round of the 1972 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams, but with the intention of turning him into a safety. During the pre-season he played in several games and during one, he collided with rookie running back Ray Jamieson of the Oakland Raiders. The collision broke Jamison's neck and ended his career. Phillips was waived just before the start of the season, one of the last players cut to make room on the roster for the start of the season. After his career was over, Phillips married Tom Landry's daughter Kitty and became a banker in Austin. In the 2014 movie My All American, Phillips is portrayed by actor Mike Seitz.

The fair began in 1915 and has continued to grow and become one of the most well known events in New England, and the largest fair in New Hampshire. History The Hopkinton State Fair was originally started as a two-day agricultural event by the Contoocook Board of Trade, which held the first fair on October 5 and 6, 1915, at George's Park in Contoocook village. The event was named the \\"Hopkinton Fair\\" or the \\"Contoocook Valley Fair\\". The net profit for the first fair was just under $5. There was no fair in 1917 nor 1918. In 1921, the board expanded the fair to a three-day event from Tuesday through Thursday. World War II caused the fair to be cancelled between 1942 & 1945\\\\. The fair consisted of agricultural exhibits, food vendors, baseball games, horse races, games, amusement rides and sideshow tents. Other entertainment such as the Hopkinton Town Band concerts became quite popular over the years. Ribbon and monetary prize competitions were popular exhibits for livestock and other farm animals. After enduring tremendous growth, in 1947 the fair moved to its present location behind the Hopkinton High School, as it needed more land for its ever-expanding exhibits. In 1953, the Fair Association acquired more property for additional expansion. In 1980, the fair became a five-day event opening on Thursday and operating through Labor Day. In December 1985, the association directors voted to change the name of the fair to its current \\"Hopkinton State Fair\\". In 1986, the fair held a logo design competition. The winner was Doug Price of Contoocook with the original design of the current fair logo. In 2014, the association decided to shorten the fair back to a four-day event, running Friday through Labor Day. This fair will return in 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic caused 2020's cancellation.

From 1997 to 2012, she was the first deputy country farmer. Political positions In her role as a Commissioner on Narcotic Drugs, Mortler soon became the target of diverse criticism. Given her previous focus on agriculture, she was criticized as unqualified for the position. The German Cancer Aid has responded with praise to Mortler's initiative to ban tobacco advertising in Germany. Her initiative failed and nothing happened in this issue until April 2015. By 2014 they wanted to \\"hold intensive discussions in the federal government\\", she said in a Die Zeit article. In 2018, Mortler criticized the portrayal of smoking in television and film programs that received public funds and urged the German film industry to produce fewer scenes involving cigarettes. By early 2015, Mortler came under heavy criticism which mostly arose from social media. Under the Twitter hashtag #Mortler and on Facebook many concerned individuals and organizations voiced their discontent with the commissioner. A petition which called for her resignation garnered over 14,000 votes within a few days. She was criticized for incompetence, an inappropriate qualification in \\"rural home economics\\" (German: ) for the job, having a double standard (because of her promotion of alcohol consumption) and a preoccupation concerning suggestions about cannabis legalization. A main point of criticism are her justifications for the illegality of cannabis in contrast to the legality of alcohol - in interviews she stated that (translated) \\"in contrast to Cannabis alcohol is part of our culture\\" and \\"Because Cannabis is an illegal drug. Full stop.\\" Due to the severe criticism, Mortler deleted her Facebook account.

Its stated aim is to advance the profession of graphic design in Quebec and to help its members develop both professionally and financially. Its activities include professional development, co-organizing the Grafika design awards competition, lobbying, and the DGA certification program. The SDGQ has a reconciliatory role in the debate on graphic design certification in Canada. History The history of the SDGQ can be traced back to 1972 when Quebec graphic designers, Georges Beaupr√© and Roger Lafortune, formed a committee to found the (SGQ). However, SGQ was not officially founded until 1974 when the new association was incorporated. In 1995 the SGQ replaced the word ‚Äú‚Äù (graphic designers or graphic artists) in its name with ‚Äú‚Äù (graphic designers), changing its name to (SDGQ). On June 14, 2011, during its annual general meeting, the SDGQ officially launched its certification program for graphic designers in Quebec. In 2013 the SDGQ adopted a new visual identity, replacing its existing ‚Äúdg‚Äù wordmark with a new ‚ÄúSDGQ‚Äù wordmark. Certification SDGQ members working in the field of graphic design who have accumulated a minimum of 7 years of combined professional experience and education in graphic design can apply to be certified. Candidates are required to submit their portfolios to a panel of three DGA-certified judges for an anonymous review. During the review, the candidate‚Äôs work is evaluated according to three criteria, namely, pertinence, responsibility, and creativity. Certified members are accredited with a , DGA. DGAs are required to follow SDGQ‚Äôs code of ethics. There is a procedure in place to investigate DGAs who are accused of violating the code of ethics; violators can receive penalties up to and including having their DGA titles revoked. A plan to align the DGA and RGD certifications was announced in 2012, and the written examination portion of the process was set to harmonize within 5 years. The DGA title is considered by the Association of Registered Graphic Designers to be the French equivalent of its RGD title. Affiliations SDGQ is a member of Icograda, the (CIDQ), Mission Design, and the (CICQ). It also has formal partnerships with the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada, the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario, and Infopress, a publishing company. Publications SDGQ has published two books, the ' (the graphic designer‚Äôs guide to management and professional practice) for graphic designers in Quebec, and ' (becoming a graphic designer: a guide to graphic design education in Quebec).

But the Land of Unlimited Possibilities turns out to be anything but for our hapless heroes. Though the American public has demonstrated countless times, that they'll pay anything to hear German folk songs and other pop songs, the von Trapps on the verge of being penniless and suicidal, thanks to Father Wasner, who's determined to teach Americans to appreciate great church music ... no matter how much his \\"cultural mission\\" pushes the von Trapps to starvation. Only the insistence of paying patrons that they drop the holy roller music and the guffaws of the audience abandoning their shows finally convinces Maria, that it's time to start entertaining the paying public and give Palestrina a rest.

Founded in 1925, its heyday was in the 1970s under the name ASPO Tours, with two league titles in 1976 and 1980 and a European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1976. After going through financial strife and successive reorganisations, Union Tours Basket M√©tropole is now the heir of the bankrupt club, as of July 2015 it plays in the fourth-tier Nationale 2. History =ASPO Tours= The club was formed as the sports wing of railway company Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans in the city of Tours with the name Association Sportive du Paris-Orl√©ans. It therefore had close links to the railway industry, with a good portion of members either related to or themselves workers in the industry. As such the club later received subsidies from SNCF, the nationalised railway company, also enjoying in kind benefits such as reduced ticket fares.Roy (2006), 63 The basketball section was formed in 1925,Roy (2006), 44 a women's section was created in 1937.Roy (2006), 47 ASPO was Touraine champion every year from 1932 to 1940. During the 1950s, after the parent company had been amalgamated into the SNCF, the club was renamed Association Sportive de Pr√©paration Olympique, keeping the same initials. It reached the Nationale, the highest division in the country, in 1950, staying there until 1953 before returning in 1955.Roy (2006), 69 The club saw its first foreign recruits in 1956, two American soldiers from a military base in nearby Chinon.Roy (2006), 85 After beating Berck (crowned champions in 1973 and 1974) by two points in March 1976, Tours won the French league that same year.Roy (2006), 93 It also reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1976, in only its second participation in a European competition. However, the French would lose 83-88 to Cinzano Milano. The club had an unremarkable European Champions Cup, not repeating its success domestically either, with two successive seventh-place finishes before a fourth place in 1978‚Äì1979.Roy (2006), 95 ASPO Tours was again crowned French champion in 1980. =Tours Basket Club= In 1981, the ASPO basketball section became Tours Basket Club and became independent in all ways from the other sections of the organisation.Roy (2006), 116 After a series of mid-table finishes, Tours ended the 1988‚Äì89 season in the penultimate place and was relegated from the first division.Roy (2006), 136 =NPO= During the 1997‚Äì98 season, Tours Basket Club became NPO Tours (a pseudo-acronym in effect signifying New PO), also changing its historical colours of blue and white to red, white and black to mirror the successful Chicago Bulls. The club had been struggling financially for years and that season worsened the situation. NPO Tours was declared bankrupt on 5 June 1998 with debts of 4.5 million francs, its participation in the league had been earlier denied.Roy (2006), 165 =Later incarnations= Touraine Basket Club was formed the same year, playing in the Nationale 2, the amateur fourth division. In 2004, the municipalities of Tours and neighbouring Jou√©-l√®s-Tours pushed for a union between TBC and AS Jocondien from the latter town, which resulted in the fusion side Tours Jou√© Basket, playing in Nationale 2. However, it proved an awkward collaboration and the club amassed significant debts (‚Ç¨130,000 out of a budget of ‚Ç¨380 000) and was declared bankrupt in 2009. Touraine BC then played alone in the Nationale 3, the fifth division. After repeated requests from TBC, a union was formed with PLL Tours, then of Nationale 2, in June 2014 to form Union Tours Basket M√©tropole.

Its population was 1,000 as of the 2001 Ukrainian census. It is notorious for Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down by rebels supported by Russia and crashed in the south of the village. Hrabove is located beside the Mius River, some ten kilometers north-east of Shakhtarsk, and on the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast.  History  The village was founded in the late fifteenth century–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –∏ —Å–µ–ª –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –°–°–†: –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å. ‚Äî –ò–Ω.-—Ç –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ê–ù –£–°–°–†-–ö.: –ì–ª–∞–≤.—Ä–µ–¥. –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –°–æ–≤. –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏–∏. —Å—Ç—Ä. 745 on the left bank of Mius River; it was repositioned to its present site in 1787. A stone church, the Holy Trinity Church, was built in 1803. Its basic form survives to this day, though it was substantially rebuilt in 1903. Hrabove became part of the newly emerging Soviet Union in February 1918 under a revolutionary leader called Nestor Makhno. A more stable communist based regime was in place from 1921. In 1942 the area fell under German control: Christian (Orthodox) worship was again permitted and there was a partial restitution of lands that had been confiscated from the farmers under the communist regime. However, in 1952 the church was closed by the (now, once again, Communist) authorities and the church was converted into a dance hall. The authorities then moved to destroy the church, but local people successfully prevented its complete destruction. The village came to international attention as it became the site of much of the debris from the destruction of the aircraft for Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down in the region on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 on board. At the time, Hrabove was in the conflict zone of the War in Donbass, in an area controlled by separatists.  Politics and national identities  Since 2010 the head of the village council has been Volodymyr Berezhnyi (born 1955). The 2001 census indicated a population of 1,000 people, categorized according to preferred mother tongue as 77.5% Ukrainian speaking and 22.0% Russian speaking, with a handful of Belarusian speakers. Most people living in the village identify as Ukrainian.

Tan served in prominent municipal posts in Sichuan, first as Communist Party Secretary of Guang'an, then Party Secretary of Mianyang. He was subsequently transferred to take charge of party propaganda in Hainan Province, then became Vice Governor of Hainan beginning in 2010. In 2014, Tan was subject to a corruption investigation by the Communist Party's internal disciplinary body. His Hainan colleague Ji Wenlin was also implicated with corruption. Tan was removed from office in July 2014. He has been linked to disgraced security tsar Zhou Yongkang. Biography =Early life= Tan was born and raised in Chongqing, where he graduated from Chongqing Normal University. During the Down to the Countryside Movement, Tan worked as a sent-down youth in Changning County, Sichuan. After the resumption of university entrance examination, Tan was admitted to Chongqing Normal University and received a degree on political history. After college, he was assigned to Yibin department of education, and later a provincial party-run school. He taught administrative management. He was given the title of \\"professor\\" in December 1992. In September 1995, Tan was appointed the Communist Party Secretary of Pi County, a position he held until May 1998. He then worked as the head of the Chengdu propaganda department. In March 2001, Tan was transferred to Guang'an as the Party Secretary, then he was transferred laterally to serve as party chief in Mianyang in December 2004, where he served until March 2009. =Mianyang, Sichuan earthquake= The 2008 Sichuan earthquake struck the province in May 2008. Mianyang was particularly hard hit. The region was given special attention by the central government; both General Secretary and President Hu Jintao as well as Premier Wen Jiabao visited the region in the aftermath of the earthquake. In a widely circulated photo, Tan was seen smiling in the entourage of the Premier. In a television broadcast, Tan was also seen smiling amid the debris. Tan's smiling during the most destructive earthquake to hit the country since 1976 generated significant criticism online; internet users dubbed him \\"Tan Xiaoxiao\\" (, literally \\"the laughing Tan\\") or the \\"Smiling Secretary\\" (). Tan responded to his critics during a media interview, \\"I don't think people know the truth... behind that incident. The General Secretary and the Premier were both visiting, I was greeting them. I was happy to see them, of course I wanted to smile.\\" He also said that he faced immense stress coordinating the response to the earthquake, and that \\"as a public official, you need to withstand this stress [from the criticism], otherwise it will affect the work of the earthquake rescue activities. I'm the party secretary, like any politician, criticism comes with the job. In the aftermath of the earthquake, Tan lived in a makeshift office, on the first floor, and slept on a sofa. Southern Weekend reported that Tan would scream and cry at night due to dealing with too much stress. Tan later received a medal of distinction from the central authorities for \\"exemplary work during the rescue efforts of the Sichuan earthquake.\\" He was praised for the construction of permanent housing for locals in the aftermath of the earthquake, as well as the treatment of the water in a local lake which was affected by the earthquake. Tan's term in Mianyang has also been marred with rumours that his second wife, a television host, had business interests which benefitted from government contracts aimed at increasing green space in Mianyang. His wife was made an official in Beichuan County, one of the places hardest hit by the earthquake, shortly after the earthquake struck. She then worked for the provincial Red Cross. A Caijing investigation also concluded that Tan took bribes from local businessman Liu Han (); Tan was said to have received several million yuan in gifts during the wedding reception of his daughter. =Hainan= In March 2009, Tan was elevated to lead the Communist Party's provincial propaganda department in Hainan province. This was a promotion that elevated him from the prefecture level to a provincial- level leadership body. During a meeting of the Hainan government where Tan's transfer was announced, one of the provincial government leaders showered Tan with praise, remarking, \\"this marks a strengthening of talent in the Hainan provincial government.\\" He was elected as Vice-Governor of Hainan in January 2010. On July 8, 2014, it was announced that Tan was undergoing investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China for \\"serious violations of laws and regulations\\", in a case that was tied to the corruption investigation of Ji Wenlin, another provincial official in Hainan. According to state media, Tan's offenses included accepting bribes, extramarital relationships, and engaging in \\"lavish meals, karaoke, and other expensive pastimes.\\" Both Tan Li and Ji Wenlin had at one point worked under then-Sichuan Party Secretary Zhou Yongkang. One day after state media announced the investigation into Zhou, Tan was removed from office. Tan was expelled from the Communist Party in September 2014. On October 13, 2016 , Tan was sentenced to life in prison for guilty of bribery in Guangzhou People's Intermediate Court. Personal life Tan was twice married. His second wife worked as a television host for Mianyang Television.

Design, construction, and launch Welcome was built at Coquille, Oregon, in 1900 by S.H. McAdamsNewell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, Superior Publishing (1966), at page 61. The steamer was long, with a beam of and depth of hold of .Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1901). The overall size of the vessel was 30 gross and 21 registered tons. Power was furnished by twin steam engines, each driving a pitman arm connected to a crankpin on the sternwheel. Service and route  Welcome was intended to be used for passenger service on the Coquille River. The route on the Coquille ran from Bandon on the coast, upriver to the county sea, Coquille, and then to Myrtle Point, which was near the head of navigation. In 1901 only three steamers served on the river between Coquille and Myrtle Point, these were the propeller Reta (18 registered tons) the sternwheeler Echo (53 registered tons) and Welcome (21 registered tons).\\"Improvement of Coquille River, Oregon, Between Coquille and Myrtle Point\\", Corps of Engineers Report (1902), at pages 2365-66. Between these three vessels they hauled 1,554 tons of freight upriver and 2,834 tons downriver. Upriver, the biggest single item was general merchandise, 800 tons. Downriver was almost entirely agricultural products, with the biggest single item being 1,035 tons of milk. 10,187 passengers were carried up and downriver. Stranding and rescue On March 7, 1902, at 12:30 pm while en route to Bandon, Welcome became stranded on the north flats of the Coquille River during a very heavy squall, with the wind blowing at gale strength and a rough sea.\\"Annual Report of the United States Life-Saving Service\\" (1903), at pages 134-135. The vessel was immediately spotted by the personnel at the Coquille River Life-Saving Station, who boarded the steamer and then passed a line to the steamer Favorite. Favorite however was not able to haul Welcome off the bank, and so the life-savers returned to the life- saving station in the surfboat, where they obtained an anchor, hawser, and cables, then rowed back to where Welcome was stranded. They rigged the anchor to Welcome, and that night, when the tide was high, hove the vessel off the bank without damage. Because the master of the Welcome was unfamiliar with the route, and the night was very dark, the keeper of the life-saving station piloted Welcome down to Bandon. Disposition Welcome was stranded on January 11, 1907, at Myrtle Point and became a total loss.Marshall, Don, Oregon Shipwrecks, Binford and Mort, Portland, OR 1984, at page 46, Mills, Randall V., Sternwheelers Up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country, University of Nebraska (1947), page 203, The vessel broke its mooring lines during high water, drifted into trees, and was damaged beyond repair.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing - A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, Caxton Press, Caldwell, ID (1973), at page 204.

Rev. George Herbert Kinsolving The Right Reverend George Herbert Kinsolving (April 28, 1849 ‚Äì October 23, 1928) was the second bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas, serving from 1893 to 1928. He was succeeded by the Right Reverend Clinton Simon Quin. He came from a family of clergymen. His father Rev. Otis Americus Kinsolving (1822-1894), minister at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Middleburg, Virginia became an avid Confederate, especially supporting Mosby's Rangers although G.H. Kinsolving's brother joined the Richmond Howitzers light artillery. The family of his father's second wife likewise supported the Confederacy (her father Asa Rogers became a local militia general), and after her death from complications of childbirth, Rev. Otis Kinsolving was imprisoned for treason by occupying Union forces. The child that whose birth led to that death, Lucian Lee Kinsolving (1862-1929), later became the first missionary bishop of Brazil, and G.H. Kinsolving preached the sermon at the consecration ceremony attended by twelve bishops. His other half-brother by his father's second wife, Rev. Arthur Barksdale Kinsolving (1861-1961), also became known as an author and historian in Maryland. His half-brother by his father's third wife, Rev.

Later in 2012, the Narrative stated to AbsolutePunk, that they had begun writing and working on their second studio album. Recording sessions began on March 26, 2012. The band chose to record the album in a different way of the previous, recorded entirely in a closed studio. They spent one month recording the most part of the instrumentals, vocals and sounds elements and producing it, at an English cathedral barn built in 1900, in Upstate New York, Hunter. The recordings in the barn were finished in April 2012, after that the duo went to the studio Red Wire Audio in Brooklyn to finish the album tracking. The album was produced by Bryan Russell, who has produced the previous albums released by the band, and Justin Long. The band also worked with the music producer and mixer, Richard Flack, who has previously produced records for Florence and the Machine and Robbie Williams.

The band also worked with Sam Moses for the album mastering in Nashville, TN. Also the band stated that the album was delayed due to the \\"budgetary constraints of the independent group leding to a slowing and eventual end of the project\\".  Style and influences  To write and compose the musical style of the Golden Silence, the band took influences from folk artists such as Counting Crows, Arcade Fire, Bon Iver, Bruce Springsteen, Regina Spektor, Modest Mouse and Jimmy Eat World.

After leaving the barn, the Narrative released a B-side compilation, titled B-Sides and Seasides on April 4, 2012, to fund the album production with donation packages sold through their official website. These donation packages included from digital downloads to Skype performances, exclusive items and private acoustic shows.

One individual photoreceptor type can therefore not differentiate between a change in wavelength and a change in intensity. Thus the wavelength information can be extracted only by comparing the responses across different types of receptors. The principle of univariance was first described by W. A. H. Rushton (p. 4P). Both cone monochromats (those who only have 1 cone type) and rod monochromats (those with no cones) suffer from the principle of univariance.The principle of univariance can be seen in situations where a stimulus can vary in two dimensions, but a cell's response can vary in one. For example, a coloured light may vary in both wavelength and in luminance. However, the brain's cells can only vary in the rate at which action potentials are fired. Therefore, a cell tuned to red light may respond the same to a dim red light as to a bright yellow light. To avoid this, the response of multiple cells is compared.

The company serves as a broker and takes roughly 20% of each transaction booked through its site. As of September 2016 Rover.com was valued at $300 million.  History  The concept for Rover.com was initially presented at the Startup Weekend contest in Seattle, Washington in June 2011, and was the contest's first-place winner. Greg Gottesman, a managing director at Madrona Venture Group, was among the team of software developers and designers who proposed the idea of an ‚Äúonline matchmaking service connecting pet owners in need of pet care with individuals who might want to take care of a canine companion for a few days.‚Äù Gottesman shared the idea with Aaron Easterly, a 15-year tech veteran with a focus on online marketplaces. Easterly became CEO and Gottesman became a board member. Rover.com first began connecting pet owners and sitters in Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, then expanded to all 50 states in 2012. On March 29, 2017, Rover.com acquired DogVacay in an all-stock deal. At that time, it was reported that total bookings on the combined sites amounted to $150 million in 2016, of which they kept about 20% in commission fees. = Financing = Rover.com's first round of investment funding was secured in April 2012, led by Madrona Venture Group.

In November 2006, Zhang was promoted to become the head of the provincial Propaganda Department. In December 2011, Zhang was named the Communist Party Secretary of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province. In Kunming, Zhang was largely known for his extensive street renovation projects, which he said was part of a strategy to make Kunming more attractive to tourists. One of his 'pet projects' was the city's Beijing Road renovation project. In 2013, rumours began circulating in the city's political circles about Zhang possibly facing an investigation. In July 2014, Zhang was removed from office for \\"serious disciplinary violations\\". On July 16, 2014, Zhang was expelled from the Communist Party of China after the party investigation concluded that Zhang had \\"wasted government funds\\" and that he had \\"abused his power for personal gain.\\" He was demoted to the sub-division level non-leading civil service position (fuchuji). The investigation did not conclude that his actions broke the law, merely that they were \\"severe violations of party discipline\\", therefore he was not further prosecuted. Zhang's former superior, former Yunnan provincial party chief Bai Enpei, was also placed under investigation in 2014.

It has also appeared in New York, eastern Canada, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Portugal.  Structure  The BLMV genome is bipartite containing two segmented regions of linear, positive-sense, single stranded RNA. The entire genome of the virus is 14600 nucleotides long, and the RNA-1 has a partially sequenced region that is 7600 nucleotides long. The virus consists of a naked, icosahedral capsid that is 28 nm in diameter. The genome of the virus codes for both structural and non-structural proteins, and the lipids of this virus are unknown.  Strains of the Virus  There are currently three known strains of the Blueberry leaf mottle virus. The original strain (BLMV) infects highbush and lowbush varieties in Michigan and eastern Canada. A second strain (BLMV-NY) has only been reported in one case in New York and infected an American grapevine. The third strain was discovered in Bulgarian grapevines and is known as the grapevine Bulgarian latent nepovirus. Grapevines with this strain are asymptomatic.  Hosts  The primary host of BLMV is the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum). Other hosts include lowbush blueberry types (V. angustifolium and V. myrtilloides), hybrids of highbush and lowbush blueberry types (V. corymbosum x V.angutifolium), American grapevines (Vitis labrusca), and Bulgarian grapevines (Vitis vinifera).  Symptoms  Symptoms of BLMV include malformed, mottled leaves that are pale green in color and have smaller than healthy leaves. The leaves may also have transparent spots that are visible when they are held up to the light. Bushes may be stunted and if bushes are badly infected, they may show dieback of stems with little regrowth. Symptoms do not appear until three to four years after infection.http://migarden.msu.edu/uploads/files/e3048.pdf  Transmission  Unlike many nepoviruses, BLMV does not appear to have a nematode vector and is instead spread by honeybees during pollination via infected pollen. The virus can also be seedborne in seedlings of an infected bush although this is somewhat rare and has only happened in 1.5% of reported BLMV cases.  Prevention  There is no known treatment for BLMV and prevention is the best method of control. Blueberry bushes should be planted only if they are approved by legitimate virus-testing programs, especially in areas where the virus has been reported. Other blueberry bushes that have already been infected should be identified by ELISA and destroyed completely so that they do not grow back and risk infecting other bushes. It is also recommended, since honeybees spread the virus, that all honeybee hives should not be placed anywhere near infected bushes.

He has written a book, Beware the Night, which details many of his paranormal investigations; his accounts were later the basis of the film Deliver Us from Evil. Sarchie, in 2016, was featured in the film Hostage to the Devil, which detailed the life of Malachi Martin.  Personal life and ministry  Sarchie served eighteen years as a NYPD sergeant in the South Bronx precinct, and was a member of the Street Crime Unit working undercover stopping in-progress crimes. As such, Sarchie describes himself as a \\"committed Christian\\"; he possesses a relic of the True Cross. Ralph Sarchie, along with his partner Mark Stabinski, carry with them wooden Christian crosses and holy water when called to tackle \\"demonic infestation around the city.\\" He assists in Christian exorcisms. His career as a Catholic Christian demonologist has included regularly meeting with and accompanying Ed and Lorraine Warren on their cases. Sarchie states that demonic possession can be identified by signs \\"including unnatural strength, speaking in different languages, having knowledge of events that one would have no way of knowing, a woman speaking in a man‚Äôs voice and a person making animal sounds.\\" He states that he prays everyday and among these prayers are the Dominican rosary. When interviewed by TheBlaze, he stated that he has \\"never accepted a penny for his assistance\\" and has to fund travelling expenses himself when he takes on cases.  Books  = Beware the Night = In 2001, St. Martin's Press published Sarchie's book, Beware the Night (also titled Deliver Us from Evil), co-written by Lisa Collier Cool, about his experience as a NYPD cop and demonologist. Beware the Night synopsis: > \\"A seventeen-year NYPD veteran, Ralph Sarchie works out of the 46th Precinct > in New York's south Bronx. But it is his other job that he calls \\"the Work\\": > investigating cases of demonic possession and assisting in the exorcisms of > humanity's most ancient--and most dangerous--foes. Now he discloses for the > first time his investigation into incredible true crimes an inhuman evil > that were never explained, solved, or understood except by Sarchie and his > partner. Schooled in the rituals of exorcism, and an eyewitness to the > reality of demonic possession, Ralph Sarchie has documented a riveting > chronicle of the inexplicable that gives a new shape to the shadows in the > dark. In 'Beware the Night,' he takes readers into the very hierarchy of a > hell on earth to expose the grisly rituals of a Palo Mayombe priest; a young > girl whose innocence is violated by an incubus; a home invaded by the > malevolent spirit of a supposedly murdered nineteenth-century bride; the > dark side of a couple who were, literally, the neighbors from hell; and > more. Ralph Sarchie's NYPD revelations are a powerful and disturbing > documented link between the true-crime realities of life and the blood- > chilling ice-grip of a supernatural terror.\\"  Film  = Deliver Us from Evil = On July 2, 2014, Screen Gems/Sony Pictures released a full-length motion picture, Deliver Us from Evil, inspired by Sarchie's accounts. The film followed Sarchie (Eric Bana) into the paranormal investigations he immersed himself in, all the while taking care of his family and working the midnight-to-8:00 A.M. shift as a cop. However, not many of the events recounted in the book actually remain in the film, as most have been changed and re-imagined by the scriptwriters/producers of the script/film. The film drew mixed reviews and was a success at the box office. The film grossed $30.5 million domestically in the United States and $87.9 million worldwide. = The Demon Files = Sarchie hosted Destination America series The Demon Files which started airing from November 1, 2015.

It consists of marine dolomites and limestones. The formation dates to the Middle Cretaceous, spanning from the Aptian of the Early to the Cenomanian of the Late Cretaceous. The dolomites, dolomitic breccias and limestones of the formation have been deposited in a lagoonal to estuarine environment and contain many fossil fish, flora and rudists, typical reef-building organisms of the Cretaceous. The formation rests on top of the Santiago and San Ricardo Formations, and is overlain by the Campanian to Maastrichtian Ocozocoautla Formation. The thickness of a composite section of the formation amounts to .  Description  The Sierra Madre Formation was first formally described by Guti√©rrez Gil in 1956, but previously reported by other authors (B√∂se, 1905; Ver Wiebe, 1925; M√ºllerried, 1936; Imlay, 1944). The formation was studied in more detail and subdivided in several members (Chubb, 1959; S√°nchez-Montes de Oca, 1969; Zavala-Moreno, 1971; Castro-Mora et al., 1975; Michaud, 1987; Quezada-Mu√±et√≥n, 1987). A composed thickness of was suggested by Steele and Waite (1986) for the Sierra Madre Formation, subdivided into 21 lithofacies. The lowermost lithofacies corresponds to the stratigraphic level of El Espinal quarry, defined by Steele and Waite (1986) as dolomite and dolomitic breccia, located between from the base of the formation, which rests conformably on top of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous San Ricardo Formation. The top is covered unconformably by the Campanian to Maastrichtian Ocozocoautla Formation. The depositional environment is described as an environment with high oxygen concentration and high primary productivity with sporadic influence of strong waves and/or currents in a brackish marginal marine environment; shallow lagoon or estuary.  Fossil content  The formation preserves fossil fish, flora and marine invertebrates dating back to the Cretaceous period, ranging from the Aptian of the Early Cretaceous to the Cenomanian of the Late Cretaceous.Sierra Madre Formation, Chiapas at Fossilworks.orgEl Espinal Quarry at Fossilworks.org The fossils in El Espinal quarry were found in finely laminated orange clay layers interbedded with dolomitic limestone and interbedded with relatively thick layers of cream limestone that range from , with some layers showing ripples, desiccation cracks, algal mats, and flat-pebble conglomerates.

The company was founded in 2013 by Tyler Yohe.  History  Broken Crayon Games was founded as an subsidiary boutique publisher branch of Broken Crown Games, LLC. The idea to form the publishing branch came when their parent company, Broken Crown Games, received international press for their out-of-game content called, the Science Behind the Sci-Fi. With the increased spotlight from the indie gaming community Broken Crown owner, Tyler Yohe, was overwhelmed by other indie studios with requests for marketing and business suggestions. To provide that aid, Tyler founded Broken Crayon Games. The first to join the boutique publisher was local studio, Beauty of the Fall Productions. The studio had four released titles for iOS with minor sales. Through coordination with Broken Crayon, they two organizations re-released an Android port of the original titles in July 2013. After having successful results with the re-released Android ports, the pair worked together on a completely original title, Wizardous: An Apprentice's Betrayal. Beauty of the Fall Productions and Broken Crayon Games continue to produce titles together to this day. Since the original trial with Beauty of the Fall Productions, Broken Crayon Games has expanded their to collaboration to include numerous other independent studios.

She has a BA in Photographic Design (2000) from School of Design, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and MA Photography (2005) from Bergen National Academy of the Arts, Norway. Work Pang primarily works in photography, video art and installation art. Pang's works had widely been exhibited locally and internationally, and also been selected as part of the Asian Art Biennale (2007) at the National Museum of Fine Arts, Taichung, Taiwan and Hong Kong Art Biennale 2005, and as well been collected by the Macao Museum of Art. Fellowship In 2003, Pang was received a scholarship from The Ministry of Education and Research of Norway to her pursue master's degree study. Pang's video installation for the Hong Kong Art Biennale 2005 was titled \\"Distance = Time x Speed\\" and explores her journey as an artist from a young person in Hong Kong to her time as a graduate student in Norway. As part of the November 2005 opening of \\"Beyond: 2nd Guangzhou Triennial\\" at the Guangdong Museum of Art, Pang collaborated with professor of design Matthew Turner and the Asia Art Archive in organizing a one-day symposium entitled \\"Trading Places: Cultural Imaginaries of the Pearl River Delta.\\" In 2009, Pang received the Asian Cultural Council fellowship, supported by The Starr Foundation, to conduct research on community art and photography in the US. Projects Pang's time in the United States inspired her to try to strengthen the independent publishing scene in Hong Kong. Pang was one of the founders of KLACK Photography and Cultural Magazine, the first issue released in summer 2010. In 2011, Pang started the independent art publishing project Small Tune Press, which produces artist‚Äôs books and zines. Small Tune Press focuses on publishing photography, drawing, collage, conceptual work and poetry. In a 2018 interview, Pang said she was inspired to start Small Tune Press in order to create a way for lesser-known artists to distribute their work to the public. ‚ÄúIn building Small Tune Press, I consider forming alliances to be one of the most vital outcomes of this endeavor,‚Äù she said. Pang also credited her fellow artist Susanne B√ºrner, who she met when B√ºrner was in Hong Kong doing research, for encouraging her to found Small Tune Press. The first book the press published was B√ºrner's ‚ÄúVanishing Point: How to Disappear in China without a Trace,\\" which examines the different roles of people in modern Chinese society. In 2017, Pang has co-created a collective, Zine Coop, that promotes zine culture in Hong Kong by hosting production workshops. Pang also co-founded Queer Reads Library in 2018 with artist-curator Kaitlin Chan. Queer Reads Library is a mobile collection of internationally sourced queer publications and independently published zines. Pang's experiences in the world of independent publishing have lead her to become an outspoken voice for the need for a strong independent press in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. \\"Independent voices remain restricted and obstructed in many places in Asia under different cultural, social, and political circumstances,\\" she said in 2017.  Zine Coop and the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests  Hong Kong-based zines have also been an integral part of the conversation around how artists and other creatives are participating in the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Zine Coop, the collective co-founded by Pang, has published zines satirizing the state of sex education in Hong Kong as well as zines discussing mental health and society pressures. As a direct response to the Hong Kong protests, Zine Coop launched several exhibitions and events in support of the protestors. One of the most notable ones was the exhibition \\"Freedom-Hi\\" which traveled to 17 cities around the world and focused on illuminating Hong Kong's political crisis. ‚Äú[W]hat zines offer, especially for reading Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy movement, is a more sit-back reflective kind of reading experience. You are not only reading hard news, but also different perspectives on the movement and different ways of self-expression,\\" said Zine Coop member Ranee Ng.

It is a 100 MW solar plant spanning and hosting 392,158 solar modules. The project was constructed by the Government of Punjab, Pakistan in May 2015 with the cost of $131 million. Background and operation = History= The project of solar powered park was approved by Government of Punjab, Pakistan on August, 2013. In late 2013, the Canadian Solar Company, signed a contract with Punjab government, for setting up 500 MW solar powered park with $175 Million, however, it was not pursued for unknown reasons. The contract of Phase-1 construction, 100MW project, costing $215 million with $131.15 million as EPC cost and $73 million as O&M; cost was awarded to a Chinese company, TBEA Xinjiang SunOasis Co. Ltd. Although, the project was scheduled to be completed in March 2014, it was delayed by nine months due to slow procedural arrangements by Punjab government and was rescheduled to be completed in December 2014. To manage the political impact of the delay, a ground breaking ceremony was conducted in May 2014 by Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, with extended deadline of completion in December 2014. Chief Minister of Punjab, Shehbaz Sharif, showed his concerns over the slow progress of the project, he told the management of the project that \\"any delays in the project are unacceptable\\". The project was completed in March 2015 and was inaugurated on 5 May 2015 by Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif in a hefty ceremony at Bahawalpur. = Technical details of Phase-1 (100 MW project)= Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park is located in the desert area of Lal Sohanra, Cholistan, Bahawalpur. It is the largest solar plant in Pakistan. It produces 100 MW, spans , and hosts 392,158 solar modules. The project was constructed in 2015 at a total cost of $215 million, with major EPC cost of $131 Million, shared by the Government of Punjab, Pakistan and Bank of Punjab. The construction of the project was done by TBEA Xinjiang SunOasis Co. Ltd. The initial project plan included 1000 MW, as first phase of project 100 MW was installed. The Phase-1, a 100 MW site, is hosting 392,158 solar modules of 255 Wp each, 100 centralised inverters of 1 MW each, 100 transformers of 1 MVA each at 33kV. There are also 2 transformers of 100 MVA each at 132 kV in a 100 MVA substation. The electrical output is being connected to a 132kV transmission line that runs through the Solar Park. = Phase-II construction plans= The second phase of project started in September 2015 by issuance of a letter of Intent (LOI) to Zoenergy, a subsidiary of ZTE, Telecommunication giant of China. However, Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), immediately criticised the award of the contract without competitive bidding and completion of the entire process in just one week's time. The central contract cell of WAPDA narrated, \\"Entire deal is shrouded in mystery and would create legal and contractual problems for everyone.\\" Apparently, Zoenergy was not considered for the 100 MW, first phase of the project construction, attributing it as Telecommunication company. Opposition took the government to Supreme Court of Pakistan in November 2014, on violation of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PEPRA) rules and fast track award of the contract. Anwar Kamal, a legal expert, said that, \\"accepting high risk bank guarantees creating rights for the investor will haunt Punjab government in future. The federal bodies were totally ignored and Punjab government conducted the matter in non transparent way.\\" It was noted that during awarding of contract to Zoenergy, several renowned power firms were ignored and the contract was given to a telecommunication firm without any competitive bidding. Despite all the litigation, a $1.5 billion contract was awarded to Zonergy Company Ltd for 900 MW project to be completed in Phase 2 (up to 300 MW) and Phase 3 (up to 900 MW) with the aim of approaching planned 1000 MW. In June 2015, the Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif announced that 300 MW production will start from the end of 2015, and entire 1000 MW production will be commenced by 2016. To follow the operation closely, he appointed Ahad Cheema, a 20th grade officer, who was already working as director general of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), as executive officer of the project. In a follow up meeting in July 2015, Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif directed project stakeholders to expedite the work and complete the 300 MW production phase by end of 2015 and the entire 1000 MW by April 2016. However, Zonergy Company Ltd. was unable to complete any targets amid different problems and the project was not able to exceed the Phase-1 100 MW installation. =Interest by Turkish companies= In January 2017, a Turkish company called Zorlu Enerji also showed interest to develop 100 MW project in 6 months at the 1000 MW QASP site. In February 2018, Zorlu Enerji again showed their interest in similar venture; however, the project was not able to kick off for unknown reasons. Hurdles, conflicts and plans of privation = Operational hurdles = Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park was unable to produce affordable energy and expected output, due to several reasons: # Bahawalpur is desert terrain , having high dust count, therefore, the efficiency of panels were reduced by 40%. It required 30 people to clean panels with 15 days to restore the panels back to their full capacity, which reduced production of installed 100MW plant to below 18 MW. # Each of the 400,000 installed panels required one litre of water to clean. A 15 days cleaning cycle required 124 million litres of water (enough to sustain 9000 people) while rain in the Cholistan desert is rare and far between. Providing such huge amount of water in desert terrain, became a challenging and daunting task for management team. Besides, the manual cleaning methods allowed setting of dust before it was re-cleaned. # The temperature of Bahawalpur rises above 45 degrees celsius, which is much higher than the 25 degrees celsius required for efficient solar power production. # QASP produced too little power at too much cost, in fact it had the second highest per unit cost in Pakistan after the Nandipur Power Project. The upfront capital expenses (CAPEX) of $131.15 million ($1.31 million/MW) was very high like other solar projects; while unlike other solar plants it was unable to achieve balanced recurring operational expenses (OPEX) due to low power production against the expected 100 MW. Due to the aforementioned reasons, the project faced long-term operational hurdles and conflicts with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). Despite the fact that Balochistan is more suitable for solar power with more barren land and suitable dust count, Government of Punjab convinced the Prime Minister that Punjab is more suitable venue for solar power. Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif later accepted that producing 18.5 MW for Rs. 13.5 billion is an expensive deal. = Tariff conflicts with NEPRA = A MOU signed in July 2014 determined the tariff of Rs. 14 between Government of Punjab and China. Based on this, NEPRA granted astonishingly high tariff of Rs. 14 to QASP Pvt. Ltd, while the rest of the world enjoyed solar tariff of less than Rs. 4. For example, solar prices in India touched INR 2.42 with decrease in cost in solar production. Though the interest rate in Pakistan is much lower than India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico etc. and Pakistan offers entire foreign equity and no taxes; but still it has the highest solar tariff in the world. NEPRA in September 2016 tried to reduced the tariff from Rs. 14.5 per unit to Rs 9.25 per unit, maintaining that cost of solar production had reduced sharply in the last 4 years and besides it is much lower in other parts of the world. However, Zonergy threatened to withdraw from Phase-2 and Phase-3 of project , and asked the Chief Minister of Punjab to pressure NEPRA. After signaling to withdraw its commitment of 900 MW extension, she went into litigation over the matter. Finally, the scores were settled attributing subsidy contributed by Ministry of Water and Power; however, it added to existing circular debt and the remaining was transferred to consumers. In February 2017 Ministry of Water and Power accepted that Rs.100 billion is paid each year as subsidy in the power sector while Rs. 200 billion is paid by consumers as various surcharges. Nevertheless, several financial experts criticised the high solar tariff despite decrease in solar production costs. For example, Dr. Farrukh Saleem criticised the current Rs. 18 tariff of QASP and compared it with the Rewa Ultra Mega Solar in Madhya Pradesh (India), where the tariff is equivalent to Pakistani Rs. 5.19 only. The high production costs of the project, ongoing tariff conflicts between both sides and long term maintenance costs impeded extension aims and future investments. = Plans of privatisation = Initially planned to install 1000 MW, the project was later curtailed. The initial 100 MW plant was commissioned in May 2015, and was completed by TBEA Xinjiang SunOasis Co. Ltd. It was decided in June 2017 to privatise the solar park, due to 18 MW production against 100 MW capacity and its high maintenance costs. A major controversy broke in December 2017, when a company named Jahangir Siddiqui & Co Ltd (JSCL), owned by Ali Jehangir Siddiqui, the business partner and close friend of Sharif family, was pre-qualified to attain 100% equity stake in Quaid-e- Azam Solar Power (Private) Limited. It was also feared that entire tax exception awarded to privatization of the project is done to facilitate Ali Jehangir Siddiqui. Despite the criticism on awarding business partners for ownership of the project, Jahangir Siddiqui & Co. was invited in March 2018 to submit bid along with eight other companies. Although the bidding process was due to be completed in April 2018, the process was delayed because of a corruption probe by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) initiated by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, after heavy misappropriation was found in the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP)'s report. Controversies and criticism =Inefficient production at high cost = Quaid-e-Azam solar park produced too little and too expensive power. In spite of high upfront capital expenses (CAPEX) like other solar projects, it was unable to achieve balanced operating expenses (OPEX). With total of upfront $131.15 million ($1.31 million / MW) CAPEX it produced only 18 MW for installed 100 MW capacity. The low production was attributed to the dusty environment of Cholistan desert and unsuitable weather conditions. Chief minister of Punjab Shahbaz Shareef admitted that 18.5 MW at the cost of Rs. 13.5 billion is an expensive affair. Wind power would have been a better option if the project was meant to be installed in short time. For each installed MW of solar plant produce 17.5% as compared to 35% for wind, therefore, it would take 2 MW for $2.66 million to get the same for 1 MW of wind power for $2.1 million. The uplift tariff of NEPRA is also 32% more expensive i.e. 14% per cent for solar and 10.6% for wind. The Chief Minister also admitted that hydropower is the best option in terms of per unit cost with much higher yield. Hydropower with Rs. 13.5 billion would produce 90 MW instead of 18.5 MW with far less tariff. Financial analyst Farrukh Saleem wrote that solar energy generated in Pakistan had amongst the highest per unit costs. Although the global cost of production for solar energy declined sharply between 2012 and 2017, contractors are paid large sums. As an example, QASP produced electricity at a cost of Rs. 19.83/kWh,http://www.nepra.org.pk/Tariff/IPPs/002%20Solar%20IPPs/Quaid-e- Azam%20Solar/2018/TRF-303%20QASPL%20QTR%20apr- jun%20%2018%2002-05-2018%207050-52.PDF compared to Rs. 5.19/kWh for energy produced at Rewa Ultra Mega Solar in Madhya Pradesh, India. This is despite a low tax rate and a liberal foreign equity repatriation regime in Pakistan in contrast to India. According to Ministry of Water and Power the costs of the expensive tariff and the subsidies given to the project are borne by the consumers in the form of high surcharges. =Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) Inquiry report= In March 2018 the Auditor General of Pakistan published a shocking report of serious irregularities in the award of procurements and construction (EPC) contracts and operation and maintenance (O&M;) contracts: *The contractor with the lowest bid, M/S Chint, was not awarded the contract; instead it was given to TBEA without any plausible reason. This caused the national exchequer a loss of $19.345 million. * Violations of procurements were found in 2017 against Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PEPRA) rules. It was revealed that subcontracts were awarded to companies with dubious profiles in non transparent ways. *Mr. Rashid Majeed was a member of the technical and financial bid committee and favoured TBEA. Later he managed to obtain EPC and O&M; contracts triggering a conflict of interest. He also appointed himself as consultant Emeritus getting Rs. 82.737 million, in spite of him being a member of the Bank of Punjab, the lender of the Quaid-e-Azam solar park. *Serious misuse of vehicles, bonuses, and allowances in services and site reallocations was found among several heads of the company. Even the appointments of CEO, consultants, and excess payments and perks availed during the non transparent processes. *Excessive payments in Markups were paid, the letter of credit was opened in favour of the parent company, retention of equity funds in BOP and violation of several other procedures and regulations were observation during the course of investigations. =Environmental impact of the project= Quaid-e-Azam solar park is located in UNESCO declared biosphere reserve, Lal Suhanra National Park. The project affected critical biodiversity site having wildlife like Chinkara (Indian Gazelle), Caracal Cat and Houbara Bustard, due to increased human activity in arid regions and construction of new network for commercial activities. Due to desert terrain, it needed a liter of water to clean each 400,000 panels, requiring 124 million liters of water annually, enough to feed 9,000 people. The cleaning cycle is repeated after every 15 days; imposing major threats of water reservoirs. Another concern is about fate of millions of PV panels, since they have life of 25 years, hence leaving dump of silicon. The environmentalists and experts reflected their surprise that why Balochistan having lot of barren land, high solar profile and low dust count was not selected as a potential site. During construction of the project trees worth 100 thousand of rupees were disposed at cheap rates in the dark to open market without any auctioning. Forest department officials said that Vachellia nilotica kikar trees worth 100 thousand of rupees were sold illegally to acquire the site. =Probe of misappropriation/corruption= Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mian Saqib Nisar took notice of the ongoing corruption inquires for the Quaid-e-Azam solar project, and demanded reports of its monthly production and expenditure information. The case was followed again in May 2018, where the Chief Justice took strict notice on zero power generation in Quaid-e-Azam and Bikki plants. However, the case remained pending after the retirement of Saqib Nisar and no tangible results were produced. In June 2018, the National Accountability Bureau along with other power projects started an inquiry against Quaid-i-Azam Solar power project due to irregularities and alleged corruption in the contracts; it was also recommended to place its CEO Najam Shah on the executive control list (ECL). In June 2018, ex-CEO Ahad Cheema was summoned to court on 56 company cases, to present his views on the Quaid-i-Azam Solar power project. However, he was unable to give satisfactory answers.

He was one of the best French-trained two-year-olds of 1976 when he won four races including the Prix Robert Papin and Prix Morny, as well as finishing second in the Prix de la Salamandre. In the following year he won the Prix Djebel and finished second in both the 2000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois before being transferred to be trained in England. In October 1976 he recorded his greatest success when recording an upset win over a strong field in the Champion Stakes which led to his being rated the best three-year-old to race in the United Kingdom that year. He ran without success as a four-year-old and was retired to stud, where he had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Vitig√®s was a chestnut horse with a white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in France by Herv√© de la H√©ronni√®re. He was the best horse sired by Pha√´ton, an Irish-bred grey stallion best known for winning the Grand Prix de Paris in 1967. Vitig√®s' dam Val√©, won at least two races and produced several other winners including Virunga, who finished third behind Allez France and Dahlia in the Prix de Diane. As a granddaughter of the broodmare Calluna, Val√© was related to many other good winners including Athens Wood, Bolkonski, Dibidale (Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks), Tony Bin and Viva Pataca. As a yearling, Vitiges was sold for ‚Ç£72,000 and entered the ownership of Mrs Marc Laloum. The colt was sent into training with G√©rard Philippeau at Maisons-Laffitte in France. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= After finishing second on his debut, Vitiges won two minor races before being moved up in class to contest the Group One Prix Robert Papin over 1100 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 27 July. Ridden by G√©rard Rivases, he started at odds of 10.5/1 in a field of thirteen which included challengers from Italy, England and Germany. Racing down the centre of the course, he took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win by three lengths from the British-trained filly Western Jewel, with Policrock in third and Roan Star in fourth. Three weeks later, Vitiges started 7/5 favourite for the Group One Prix Morny over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse in which his main rival in the betting was the Fran√ßois Boutin-trained Manado, who had won the Prix Yacowlef by eight lengths on his only previous start. Vitiges took the lead soon after the start but was soon challenged by Manado and the two colts disputed the lead, before the latter swerved to the left and collided with the rail 400 metres from the finish. Vitiges increased his advantage in the closing stages and won by two and a half lengths from the filly Imogene. On 14 September, the colt started the 4/5 favourite for the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400 metres on soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse. He led from the start and went two lengths clear in the straight, but weakened in the closing stages and was beaten a length into second place by Manado. The Australian jockey Bill Pyers took over the ride on Vitiges when the colt contested France's premier race for two-year-olds, the Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 5 October. In a change of tactic, he was restrained in the early stages before moving forward on the final turn but was unable to maintain his challenge and finished fifth of the eleven runners behind Manado, one place ahead of the future Epsom Derby winner Empery. =1976: three-year-old season= Vitiges began his second season in the Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres at Longchamp on 4 April. He was in contention until half way but then tired badly on the soft ground and finished last of the nine runners more than twenty lengths behind the winner Youth. Five days later he was dropped back in distance for the 1400 metre Prix Djebel on good ground at Maisons-Laffitte in which he was matched against Manado for the third time. Manado started odds-on favourite but Vitiges, ridden a usual by Rivases, won by a length at odds of 5.2/1. On his next appearance Vitiges was sent to England for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket for which he started third favourite behind Wollow and Manado in a field of seventeen runners. He took the lead from the start and maintained his advantage before being overtaken by Wollow in the final quarter mile and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. Vitiges returned to England for his next race and was moved up in distance for the 197th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half lengths at Epsom Downs Racecourse. The colt went to the front and held the lead until two furlongs from the finish. He was overtaken by Relkino and Empery and weakened in the final furlong to finish sixth of the twenty-three runners behind Empery, Relkino, Oats, Hawkberry and Wollow. On 18 July, Vitiges started the 5.2/1 third favourite for the Prix Eug√®ne Adam over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse but finished sixth of the fourteen runners, five and a half lengths behind the winner Crow. The colt was dropped back in distance and matched against older horses for the first time in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville. The race resulted in a blanket finish, with the first seven horses crossing the finish line together and Vitiges dead heating for second with Radetzky a head behind Gravelines, just ahead of Manado, Ellora and Avaray. In September, Vitiges was dropped back even further in distance for the Prix de Seine-et-Oise over 1200 metres at Maisons- Laffitte. Racing against specialist sprinters, he started favourite but after leading for 1000 metres he was overtaken and finished fourth of the ten runners behind Kala Shikari, Raga Navarro and Mendip Man. The colt was then removed from Philippeau's stable and sent to be trained in England by Peter Walwyn at Seven Barrows near Lambourn in Berkshire. As soon as he arrived at Walwyn's stable, the colt was equipped with a softer bit which enabled him to be settled more effectively. In October, Vitiges, ridden by the first time by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery started a 22/1 outsider for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket. The eighteen-runner field was a strong one, including Crow, Wollow, Rose Bowl, Malacate, and Northern Treasure. The field split into two groups on either side of the wide Rowley mile straight, with Vitiges racing in the smaller group on the far side (the right side of the course from the jockeys' point of view). Vitiges' stable companion Red Regent led the far side group before being overtaken by Rose Bowl, with Vitiges making progress from the two furlong mark. In the final furlong it became apparent that the runners on the far side were well ahead of the stands-side group as Vitiges steadily wore down Rose Bowl. Vitiges took the lead in the final strides and beat Rose Bowl by a neck with Northern Treasure two and a half lengths back in third. =1977: four-year-old season= Vitiges remained in training with Walwyn as a four-year-old but never recovered his previous form in three races. He finished fourth behind the filly Heaven Knows in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket in April and then ran tenth of the twelve runners behind Arctic Tern in the Prix Ganay on 1 May. Later that month he was equipped with blinkers in the Clive Graham Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse but showed no improvement as he finished third behind Lucky Wednesday and Norfolk Air. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two- year-olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the French Free Handicap, Vitiges was rated the second best juvenile of the season, two pounds behind Manado. The independent Timeform organisation concurred, giving him a rating of 128, two pounds below Manado and one ahead of the top British colt Wollow. In 1976, the official handicappers of Britain and France again produced separate ratings. In the French handicap, Vitiges was rated the seventh best three-year-old colt behind Youth, Crow, Empery, Exceller, Malacate and Twig Moss. The British handicapper, however, rated Vitiges the best three-year-old of 1976, ahead of Pawneese, Wollow, Crow and Empery. Timeform gave him a rating of 132, placing him alongside Wollow and the sprinter Lochnager as the third best horse of the year behind Youth and Crow. In 1977 Timeform gave him a rating of 115 ¬ß, with the ¬ß (or \\"squiggle\\") indicating a horse who is \\"ungenerous, faint-hearted or a bit of a coward\\". Stud career In the autumn of 1976, it was announced that Vitiges had been syndicated at ¬£23,000 a share (giving him a theoretical value of ¬£960,000) and would begin his stallion career at the Someries Stud at Newmarket in 1978. In fact, he began his stud career earlier than expected, covering several mares at the end of his abbreviated 1977 season. He was exported to Japan in 1986. The most successful of his offspring was Moon Madness, who won ten races including the St Leger Stakes and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. His other good winners included New Bruce Prix de la C√¥te Normande and Tants Lingfield Oaks Trial.

He was best known for his term as the Communist Party Secretary of the cities of Anqing and Chuzhou. From 2013 to 2014 he served as the vice- chairman of the Anhui provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely ceremonial legislative consultation body. He was later investigated for corruption and indicted on criminal charges of bribery. Career Han was born and raised in Feixi County, Anhui. He graduated from Anhui Agricultural University. Shortly after the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution, Han worked in his hometown as a teacher at a local school. Han began working in January 1982 in the provincial agriculture and fisheries department. He joined the Communist Party of China in July 1984. In 1987, he entered the provincial government as a staffer of the General Office, and in 1991, he began working for the provincial agricultural economics commission. Han served as the Deputy Party Secretary of Chaohu from October 1994 to July 1996. In August 1999, Han was transferred laterally to Anqing, where he ascended to become the party chief in April 2003.

Hampson was born and raised in Liverpool, before studying in London and Toronto and finally settling in London. Hampson taught at Royal Holloway, University of London, from 1973, and was Professor of Modern Literature there from 2000. From 2016 to 2019, he was Distinguished Teaching and Research Fellow in the Department of English at Royal Holloway. He is currently Research Fellow at the Institute for English Studies, University of London; Emeritus Professor at Royal Holloway; and Visiting Professor at the University of Northumbria. For his contributions to two distinct areas ‚Äì contemporary innovative poetry and the international study of Joseph Conrad ‚Äì he is, without a shadow of a doubt, a 'legend'. Life and work Robert Gavin Hampson was born in Liverpool in 1948. He studied English literature at King's College London between 1967 and 1970 and was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship to complete a master's degree at University of Toronto. He then returned to King's College, London, in 1971 where he completed a PhD on Joseph Conrad. POETRY During the 1970s he co-edited the poetry magazine Alembic with Peter Barry and Ken Edwards and was a key figure in the British Poetry Revival. His poetry was published in Cid Corman's Origin, Alan Davies's 100 Posters, and in a range of other magazines. It was also included in the Arts Council's anthology, New Poetry 3 (1977). His work as one of the editors of Alembic has received attention in two books by Wolfgang Gortschacher - Little Magazine Profiles: The Little Magazines in Great Britain, 1939-1993 (University of Salzburg, 1993) and Contemporary Views on the Little Magazine Scene (Poetry Salzburg, 2000)- and, more recently, in an interview (with Ken Edwards) by Sophie Seita in the magazine mimeo mimeo (2014). This has now been republished as 'transatlantic axis of alembic' in Jacket2.jacket2.org/interviews/transatlantic-axis-alembic His best-known work is probably his early long-poem, Seaport (Pushtika, 1995; Shearsman, 2008), which has been written about by Peter Barry, Andrew Duncan, Amy Cutler, Neal Alexander and others. Barry's extended analysis of Seaport begins by noting its 'extensive use of \\"incorporated data\\" of various kinds', ranging from various literary sources (including works by Defoe, Melville, Hawthorne and Conrad) to 'historical accounts of the growth and development of the port, of the history of race relations in the city, newspaper accounts of local events and local guidebooks' (Contemporary British Poetry and the City, p.159). He concludes by describing this long poem as 'a large-scale vehicle of surprising flexibility which can accommodate the overtly political, the archival- historical and radically pared-down versions of poetry's more familiar affective modes' (Contemporary British Poetry and the City, p.162). Andrew Duncan similarly suggested that 'Seaport' was 'a major work, where the recovery of pure facts without explanatory annotation allows the build up of a new understanding on the large scale' (The Council of Heresy, p. 29). Hampson's poetry has gone through various stages. The early work explored open-field poetics and what Peter Barry has called 'content-specific' poetics (in 'Seaport'), but also treated text in 'How Nell Scored' (1976) and 'on the trail' (1976). He subsequently explored self-conscious narrative and montage in his Godard-inspired film poems 'one plus one' (1980) and 'handy narratives' (1985); and a phrasal poetics (derived from Lyotard's 'The Differend' and his own critical engagement with the work of Adrian Clarke) in 'a human measure' (1989) and 'unicorns: 7 studies in velocity' (1989) - and subsequent volumes. This part of his career is represented in Assembled Fugitives (2001); some of the critical engagement with Clarke is evidenced in his essay 'Producing the Unknown' in 'New British poetries' (1994); and Clarke, in turn, has discussed 'a human measure' and 'unicorns' in 'Robert Hampson and a Neo-Formalist Moment', his contribution to 'For Robert' (2017). More recent work by Hampson has been engaged in exploring the resources of the sonnet. His poetry has been translated into German, Italian and Rumanian. See, for example, Wolfgang Gortschacher & Ludwig Laher, So Also Ist Das: Eine Zweisprachige Anthologie Britischer Gegenswartslyrik (Haymon-Verlag, 2002), and the translation of the sequence 'Lou Mistrau' in the Italian journal Soglie (August 2014). In 2012, his collection Reworked Disasters (knivesforksandspoons press) was long-listed for the Forward Prize. In his comprehensive study of the sonnet in English, The Sonnet (Oxford University Press, 2019), Stephen Regan discusses Reworked Disasters in relation to sonnets by Ken Edwards and Tony Lopez as examples of the contemporary avant-garde sonnet. He describes Hampson's 'serious political focus on global warfare, imperialism, and torture' in this 'linguistically discontinuous' fourteen-sonnet sequence. (The Sonnet, p.382).Hampson's more recent work includes 'love's damage', which was published in the Surrey Poetry Festival Magazine (21.05.11), edited by Amy De'Ath and Jonty Tipladystatic1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/436447/12796874; 'sonnets 4 sophie' first published in Veer Vier (September 2013)epc.buffalo.edu/library/Veer-56-1014.pdf, while an explanation of colours was reviewed by Edmund Hardy and Melissa Flores-Borquez in Intercapillary Spacehttp://intercapillaryspace. blogspot.co.uk and out of sight (crater, 2012) and Liverpool (hugs &) kisses, his 2014 collaboration with Robert Sheppard, are reviewed on the 'other room' website.http://otherroom.org/tag/roberthampson More recently, he has contributed to Robert Sheppard's European Union of Imaginary Author's project through a collaboration with Sheppard. This collaboration is included in Robert Sheppard (ed.) Twitters for a Lark: Poetry of the European Union of Imaginary Authors (Shearsman, 2017). During his time as head of the Department of English, Hampson founded the MA in poetic practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, with Redell Olsen in 2002 and the MA in creative writing with Andrew Motion in 2003. With Helen Carr and others, he was instrumental in bringing about the regulation change which enabled the introduction of creative writing into the University of London PhD. He has regularly taught on the poetic practice pathway, and he was director of the MA in creative writing for 2016‚Äì17. Graduates of the creative writing programme whom he taught include the novelists Tahmima Anam, Adam O'Riordan, Anna Whitwham and Sarah Perry and the poets Robert Selby and Declan Ryan. Graduates of the poetic practice programme whom he taught include Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, Prudence Chamberlain, Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormonde, Jooyeon Park, Nisha Ramayya, Sophie Robinson, Karen Sandhu and Steven Willey. He has also made a significant contribution to innovative poetry in London as the organiser of events and conferences and as the convenor and curator of two important seminar series. In the 1970s he organised a short reading series, Future Events, at The White Swan in Covent Garden with Ken Edwards and Mike Dobbie. At the end of the 1970s, he and Erik Vonna-Michel organised three one-day 'Saturday Courses' at Lower Green Farm: Bob Cobbing, Allen Fisher and Eric Mottram were the subjects of the different days. (See Ken Edwards's account of Lower Green Farm in Clasp and in his memoir Wild Metrics.) In the 1980s, he organised two conferences on Contemporary innovative Poetry at the Centre for English Studies in the University of London Senate House, and, in the 1990s, he facilitated the six SVP Colloquia that took place there (organised by Lawrence Upton). In 1999, he was asked to take over the TALKS series that Bob Perelman had established at King's College, London, during Pereleman's year as a visiting professor there. Hilda Bronstein has given an account of the early years of the London TALKS series in How2http://www.asu.edu/pipercwcenter/how2journal The TALKS series continued for some years at King's under Hampson's direction and then moved to Birkbeck College, University of London, where Redell Olsen and Frances Presley were co- organisers with him. It was superseded by the Contemporary Innovative Poetry Research Seminar, which he runs with Amy Evans Bauer at the University of London Institute for English Studies. In 2004, he set up the Runnymede International Literary Festival in collaboration with Royal Holloway and Runnymede Borough Council. He has continued to be the Festival Director. More recently, the Festival transferred some of it activities to Central London as 'Runnymede in London' through collaboration with the Centre for Creative Collaboration (c4cc), which also provided the venue for Polyply, the event series run by Redell Olsen, Will Montgomery and Kristen Kreider. In 2010‚Äì11, he collaborated with the Palestinian visual artist, Leena Nammari, on a concertina book, The Long View, as part of the Beyond Text project.http://www.poetrybeyond text.org/hampson-namari During 2014, he curated an event series, Amid the Ruins, with Carrie Foulkes at the Daniel Blau Gallery, Hoxton Square, London.http://otherroom.org/tag/roberthampson In 2017, on the occasion of his retirement from full-time teaching, Redell Olsen edited For Robert: An Anthology (RHUL Poetics Research Centre / The Institute of the Electric Crinolines).https://institute of electric crinolines.org CONRAD CRITICISM AND SCHOLARSHIP He has also pursued a parallel career as a Conrad scholar and editor with three monographs on Joseph Conrad: Joseph Conrad: Betrayal and Identity (1992), Cross-Cultural Encounters in Joseph Conrad's Malay Fiction (2000) and Conrad's Secrets (2013). Conrad's Secrets received the first-place prize for the Adam Gillon Award (2015) from the Joseph Conrad Society of America for the best recent work on Joseph Conrad. In 2017, he received the Ian P. Watt Award from the Joseph Conrad Society of America for excellence in Conrad studies. Previous recipients of the award include Norman Sherry and J. Hillis Miller.josephconrad.org/News/news.html. He has subsequently been awarded the third-place prize for the Adam Gillon Award (2018) for the collection of essays, Conrad and Language (Edinburgh U. P. 2016), which he co-edited with Katherine Isobel Baxter. He was editor of The Conradian (1989‚Äì96) and co-edited Conrad and Theory with Andrew William Gibson (Rodopi, 1998). He also edited various Conrad texts ‚Äì Lord Jim (1986), Victory (1989), Heart of Darkness (1995) ‚Äì for Penguin books, as well as Rudyard Kipling's Something of Myself (1987) and Soldiers Three/ In Black & White (1993) and Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines (2000). His edition of Heart of Darkness for Penguin included the first accurate transcription of Conrad's 'Congo Diary' and was the first to use the 'Carte des routes de portage' (1894), which was supplied to Belgian State Officials for the journey up-river from Matadi, to annotate Conrad's account of the same journey, which he undertook four years earlier. He also edited Nostromo and co-edited (with Andrew Purssell), Ford Madox Ford's Parade's End and Conrad's Lingard Trilogy for Wordsworth. (A short lecture by him on Heart of Darkness is available on https://www.massolit.io/lecturers/119.) More recently, he co-edited (with Helen Chambers) Guy de Maupassant's \\"Mademoiselle Perle and other stories\\" (riverrun, 2020), a selection from the translations made by Elsie Martindale and Ada Galsworthy, which were first published in 1903 and 1904 respectively. Hampson was elected Chair of the Joseph Conrad Society(UK) in 2015. He was an adviser for Hanyut (film), a film by the prize-winning Malaysian director U-Wei Haji Saari, based on Conrad's first novel, Almayer's Folly.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbmostpzbA He also appears in the 2018 TCM documentary, El sueno imposible de David Lean, an exploration of David Lean's long-held plan to adapt Conrad's masterpiece Nostromo as a film and in Sladami Conrada (In the footsteps of Conrad) on Polish television. In 2019, the Polish television series Chuligan Literacki (Literary Hooligan) devoted two successive programmes to his work on Joseph Conrad. This series, on TVP Kultura, presented fifteen programmes on 'the most outstanding English writers, philosophers and historians', and included programmes on Quentin Skinner, Antony Beevor and others. The programmes are available on vod.tvp.pl/video/chuligan-literacki.roberthampson-cz-1,40566562. ACADEMIC SERVICE In addition, he has undertaken various forms of service to the academic community.

The English term 'city' hardly applies to any populated area in Greenland (although several places in Greenland are considered \\"cities\\"), as the most populated place is Nuuk with 14,501 inhabitants. In Greenland they distinguish two kinds of settled areas: by (Danish for 'town') and bygd (Danish for 'settlement'). The seat of each municipality is a by, whereas every other settlement in a municipality is a bygd. A bygd can have anything from one to about five hundred inhabitants. Many places have Danish names in addition to the Greenlandic names. The Danish name, when applicable, is shown in parentheses. The first list shows a ranked list of all towns with more than 1000 population.

He was selected in the fourth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft by the Houston Astros. Shortly before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball season, Ruiz was traded to the Atlanta Braves. He made his major league debut with the Braves during the 2016 season. Career Ruiz attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California. He played both baseball and football. Ruiz verbally committed to attend the University of Southern California (USC) as a 14-year-old freshman to play college baseball for the USC Trojans baseball team. As a junior, he was named The San Gabriel Valley Tribunes Baseball Player of the Year. Considered a potential first round pick in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft entering his senior season, he missed most of the year due to a blood clot in his right clavicle. =Houston Astros= Ruiz was drafted by the Houston Astros in the fourth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Astros for $1.85 million over playing college baseball at USC. He made his professional debut that season for the Gulf Coast Astros and also played for the Greeneville Astros of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. He finished his first season hitting .252/.336/.400 and one home run in 38 games. In 2013, Ruiz played for the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League. He played in 114 games and hit .260/.335/.430 with 12 home runs. Ruiz spent the 2014 season with the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League. After the regular season, the Astros assigned Ruiz to the Salt River Rafters of the Arizona Fall League. =Atlanta Braves= The Astros traded Ruiz, Andrew Thurman, and Mike Foltynewicz to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Evan Gattis and James Hoyt on January 14, 2015. He was assigned to the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern League, where he struggled. Despite inconsistent results in Ruiz's first year with the Braves organization, he was invited to spring training in 2016 and began the season with the Gwinnett Braves of the Class AAA International League. He hit for a .271 batting average and a .755 on-base plus slugging percentage at the Triple A level, to go along with ten home runs and 62 runs batted in. The Braves promoted Ruiz to the major leagues on September 17, 2016. The next day, he was announced as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning of a game against the Washington Nationals, but was unable to make a plate appearance before the contest was called due to rain. Ruiz tripled for his first major league hit on September 28, against Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Frank Herrmann. Before reporting to spring training in 2017, Ruiz sought help from Azusa Pacific University track coach Kevin Reid, who aided Ruiz in improving his agility and conditioning. Ruiz began the 2017 season with Gwinnett and was promoted to the major leagues on May 18. On May 20, 2017, Ruiz hit his first major league home run off Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer. Ruiz started the 2018 season at Gwinnett. =Baltimore Orioles= The Baltimore Orioles claimed Ruiz off waivers on December 10, 2018. On August 11, 2019, Ruiz hit his first career walk-off home run off Roberto Osuna of the Houston Astros. He finished the 2019 season with a .232 average, 12 home runs and 46 RBIs in 370 at bats.

He grew up in a farming family near Sarnia, Ontario, was involved in church planting in Saskatchewan, worked as a missionary in Mozambique, South Africa, and Burundi. After serving for many years as a Free Methodist Church missionary in Southern Africa, Haley and his family moved to Burundi in the African Great Lakes Region and initiated new church planting work. Haley was profoundly influenced by the writings of Roland Allen and the idea of the indigenous church principle in cross-cultural mission strategy.  Early life  John Wesley Haley was born in Bracebridge (Muskoka), Ontario on August 25, 1878. His family moved to Sombra, Ontario. In 1898, John Haley was converted at a Free Methodist camp meeting held on his father‚Äôs farm in Lambton County, Ontario. In 1900, he was appointed by the West Ontario Conference to assist Rev. W.H. Wilson in pioneering in Western Canada (Manitoba/Saskatchewan). In 1901, he was granted a local preacher‚Äôs license.  Career  Haley sailed for Africa in 1902 where he spent many years as a missionary in Mozambique (first called Portuguese East Africa) and South Africa. As previously arranged, Esther Jane (Jennie) Hamilton, who was born in Charlemont, Ontario, June 24, 1877, joined him in 1905 and they married on March 15, 1905 in Fairview, near Umzumbe, Natal, South Africa. On January 6, 1906, Their first child, Florence, was born in Durban, Natal, South Africa. For health and family reasons, the Haleys left Africa in 1909 and, following medical advise to get onto the land, took up \\"homesteading\\" in Saskatchewan on a section of land that was given them by the Canadian government. On October 22, 1910, their son Blake was born. In 1913, the Haley moved from Saskatchewan to take up a small church in Niagara Falls, Ontario. On August 24, 1914, Dorothy was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Holding up their return to Africa, the Haleys moved from Niagara Falls to Sarnia to care for Haley‚Äôs ailing mother and sister in September 1915. In 1915, Bishop Wilson T Hogue of the Free Methodist Church, in his massive History of the Free Methodist Church of North America,Hogue, Wilson T. http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006772006 spoke of Haley as one of the best missionaries in their movement In 1917, the Haleys returned to Fairview, Natal, South Africa, where they lived for about six years. July 7, 1919, Peace was born at Fairview, Natal, South Africa. In 1932, Haley made a preliminary trip to Burundi. Without a furlough, Haley moved to Burundi in November 1934, arriving May 2, 1935 at Muyebe, Burundi.Yrigoyen, Charles and Susan Warwick. Historical Dictionary of Methodism. Scarecrow Press, Langham, MD, 2005. On July 16, 1935, Jennie, Dorothy and Peace joined him at Muyebe. Dorothy‚Äôs responsibility was to provide teachers for the outschools. Peace dispensed medicine and advice in what became later known as the \\"Morning Glory Clinic.\\" Planning to retire in South Africa in the spring, John Wesley Haley died at his daughter's home in Cleveland, Ohio on January 26, 1951 at the age of 72 and was buried in Welland, Ontario.

This vessel should not be confused with a number of other craft of the same name operating at the same time in other parts of North America. Design and construction Dora was built at Randolph, Oregon in 1910 by the Herman Brothers Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W.

U.S. Treasury Dept., Statistics Bureau, Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1911), at page 166. The overall size of the vessel was 77 gross and 64 registered tons. Power was furnished by twin steam engines, each driving a pitman arm connected to a crankpin on the sternwheel, with 55 total indicated horsepower for both combined. Total required crew was shown as two. Dora was built for Russell Panter, who named the vessel after his daughter.King, Chuck, Kirk, Linda, and Prola, Carolyn, Myrtle Creek and Vicinity: 1893-1950, Arcadia 2014, at page 27. Panter was doing business as the Myrtle Point Transportation Company.\\"News of Nearby Towns -- Plans New Boat\\", Coos Bay Times, September 2, 1913. Service and route  Dora was intended to be used for passenger service on the Coquille River. Dora was placed on a route running from Bandon on the coast, to the county seat at Coquille and then upriver to Myrtle Point. Dora served this route in conjunction with the smaller sternwheeler, Myrtle, also owned by the Myrtle Point Transportation Company. Typical service included: * On Friday, November 14, 1913, Dora transported about 20 residents of Bandon members of the Sisters of Pythias to a sisterhood meeting at Myrtle Point, Oregon.\\"Pythian Sisters to Myrtle Point\\", Bandon Recorder, November 14, 1913, page 1, col. 4. * On Sunday, February 22, 1914, Dora transported several persons from Bandon to Prosper, Oregon to witness the launching of the sternwheeler Telegraph.\\"Myrtle Point Items\\", February 24, 1914, page 1, col. 2. Competition with rival vessels In 1915, Dora came into fierce competition with the gasoline launch Charm. There was a collision between Dora and Charm, and the captains of the vessels, Willard, of Dora, and Panter, of Charm, each claimed the collision was the other's fault.\\"Steamboat Controversy May Be Brought to Head\\", Semi- Weekly Bandon Recorder, January 29, 1915, page 1, col. 6. Following the collision, the crews of the two vessels exchanged intemperate words, and someone was said to have thrown a gaspipe through a window on one of the vessels, while it was also claimed that someone had heaved a can of coal oil at the Dora. Someone concerned about passenger safety contacted Sheriff Johnson, who in turn referred the matter to the Steamboat Inspection Service. The inspectors instructed captains Willard and Panter to each submit written reports of the incident. On February 3, 1915, following a two-day trial before inspectors Edwards and Fuller, the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service suspended, for 20 months each, the licenses of Captains Walter Panter and Allen Panter, as well as that of engineer Wm. Panter, all of the Myrtle Point Transportation Company, as well as the licenses of Capt. O. R. Willard and engineer Elmer Willard, both of the Coquille River Company.\\"Riverboat Men Get Vacations\\", Bandon Recorder, February 5, 1915, page 1, col. 6. Both the Panters and the Willards were barred from operating any vessel on the Coquille River or anywhere else. Loss of a crewman On November 29, 1918, it was reported that Earl Randall, of Dundee, Oregon, a crewman on Dora, had been lost overboard during his course of duty and drowned.\\"Twenty Years Ago\\", Coquille Valley Sentinel, November 24, 1938, page 4, col. 4. The incident occurred on the Coquille River near Riverton while the vessel was steaming towards Coquille. Randall was last seen walking through the engine room. The next thing that was noticed was his cries for help as he came up to the surface of the river from underwater. The vessel was reversed and a life ring was thrown, but it was too late. Randall's body was recovered two hours later. Salvage of Myrtle Dora abandoned, June 21, 1941. In February 1921, the small steamer Myrtle had sunk at a dock at Myrtle Point. On board Myrtle was a cargo consisting of most of a rail car load of canned carrots. Dora, then owned by the Panter family doing business as the Myrtle Point Transportation Company, was sent to Myrtle Point to aid in the salvage of Myrtle and the sunken vessel's cargo. Disposition Dora was abandoned in 1927 along the bank of the Coquille River on the ranch of Paris Ward, one of the shareholders in the Myrtle Point Transportation Company.Panter, William, \\"Early River Traffic on the Coquille,\\" Glancing Back (Pioneer Lore), at 16-19, Vol. I, No. 1, Coos-Curry Pioneer and Historical Association, 1971  See also  *Steamboats of the Coquille River  Notes   References * Historic Oregon Newspapers * Newell, Gordon R. ed., H.W.

The driver of the TER train was amongst those seriously injured. There were 170 passengers on the TGV and 70 on the TER train. Three of the injured were evacuated from the crash site by helicopter.

Secretary of State for Transport, Marine and Fisheries Fr√©d√©ric Cuvillier stated that signals were under maintenance at the time. Whether or not this was a causal factor in the accident would be part of the investigation. SNCF refuted suggestions that high temperatures had caused the TGV to suddenly slow. It is thought that the TER train received a green signal and had no warning of the TGV ahead until it came in sight. The TER train had been travelling at before the collision.

It was edited by Johan Kugelberg with Philippe Verm√©s and published in the United Kingdom by Four Corners Books in 2011. Background Posters in Paris in July 1968 The Atelier Populaire, who designed and printed the posters, were a group of Marxist artists and art students who occupied the √âcole des Beaux-Arts during with the wave of wildcat strikes in May 1968. Using a silk-screen printing press they produced thousands of posters at a time. They typically were printed on newssheet using a single colour, and use a simple iconography in which the factory represents the role of workers in society and the fist stands for solidarity and resistance (see right). They comment on topics including the freedom of the press (see also Censorship in France), colonialism (see also French colonial empire) and the status of immigrant workers (see also Immigration to France). The posters were also used to voice opposition to consumerism and were inspired by the Situationist International's critique of the spectacle and Georges Perec's 1965 novel Things: A Story of the Sixties. Though the posters display various styles, individual artists were never credited and each work was treated as the work of the collective. General assemblies were held to discuss and vote on the posters. In a 1969 book of the posters, the Atelier Populaire wrote \\"To use them for decorative purposes, to display them in bourgeois places of culture or to consider them as objects of aesthetic interest is to impair both their function and their effect.\\" Much of the imagery they created, including a poster of a truncheon-wielding riot policeman (right) has since achieved iconic status. The posters were rarely saved but were collected by Kugelberg who staged an exhibition at London's Hayward Gallery in 2008. The exhibition commemorated the 40th anniversary of the protests. Overview The book includes over 200 posters. As in the exhibition which preceded it, the posters in the book are accompanied by photographs taken by Verm√©s of the students, the production process and the protests, many of which were previously unpublished. The book also includes a foreword by Verm√©s, a founder of the Atelier Populaire; translations of first- hand accounts of students' and strikers' clashes with the police; manifestos and pamphlets; a pictorial index, a bibliography, and a thumbnail gallery of posters that were not reproduced full-size. Critical reception Writing in The Guardian, Justin McGuirk noted the continued relevance of \\"the spirit of '68\\" in the United Kingdom in the wake of the 2010 student protests, describing the book as \\"a beautiful volume\\". McGuirk questioned the absence of political design from the 2010 protests and occupations, as well as the commercial street art of Banksy and Shepard Fairey, and the contemporary popularity of the 1939 Keep Calm and Carry On poster. The Los Angeles Timess Liesl Bradner also argued for the book's relevance in 2012 after the Occupy movement and Time's naming \\"the protester\\" as its Person of the Year in 2011. Alex Bec of the art blog It's Nice That noted that despite the events of May 1968 having been well documented, \\"Beauty is in the Street blew everything before it out of the water.\\" F√≠acha O'Dubhda of Eye described the book as one \\"that immerses the reader in the process through which spontaneous design and production were used to document, illustrate and instigate\\" the events of May 1968.

Silkeborg Hovedg√•rd came back into private ownership in 1906 before it was acquired by Silkeborg Municipality in 1939. Exhibitions cover the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Viking Age. Silkeborg Hovedg√•rd is also home to the Tollund Man, one of the most well-preserved naturally mummified Pre-Roman Iron Age bog bodies found in Denmark.  Papirmuseet  Tollund Man The Paper Mill was once important to the whole nation as the source of paper for money bills manufactured at the mill until 1992. The Paper Mill was founded in 1844-1845 and is inseparable from the beginning of Silkeborg. Today you can visit the museum and try for yourself how to make paper. Blicheregnen At Blicheregnen, the permanent exhibitions tell about noted poet and parson Steen Steensen Blicher (1782‚Äì1848) and about country life in general during the 19th century. Blicher grew up in the parish next to the museum, and he was parson in Thorning from 1819 to 1825 where he wrote one of his most famous novels. Throughout the year there are different special exhibitions at the museum. The museum also tells the story about the end of the civil war in the 12th century, which took place nearby the museum at the Battle of Grathe Heath (Slaget p√• Grathe Hede) where one of the Danish kings was killed.

NUCA is affiliated to the National Conservative Party and the University of Nottingham Students' Union, in addition to the Nottingham Conservative Federation and East Midlands Area Council. The Honorary President is Rt. Hon. John Hayes MP PC FRSA. NUCA alumni include many prominent Conservative Party figures. Among them are five current Members of Parliament. On 2 November 2015, NUCA voted to disaffiliate from the Party's youth wing, Conservative Future, making it a fully independent association. Committee NUCA is run by its officers and committee, who are elected each year at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). NUCA's General Secretary is responsible for running the elections. The responsibilities of each role are set out in the NUCA Constitution. The current (2019/20) committee officers are: *President - Tyler Jordan Pringle *Treasurer - Connor Malone *Campaigns officer - Tom Mobbs Events NUCA events and activities vary considerably, depending on the president and committee, but all activities follow four main strands; Port and Policy; speaker meetings; campaigning; and social events. =Port & Policy= NUCA's most popular regular event is Port & Policy, in which a political parliamentary-style debate (chaired by the President) is accompanied by a few glasses of fine port. A typical Port & Policy debate will consist of three predetermined motions selected by the committee, each of which are debated for around 45 minutes with three short intervals. Port & Policy is normally held in The Great Hall, an impressive and historically significant part of Trent Building. Dress code is usually black tie, with occasional reversion to formal wear when alternate venues are used. Port & Policy's attendance has risen sharply in recent years, with over 80 attendees in the final Port & Policy of the 2015/16 academic year and over 90 for the 2017/2018 academic year. =Speaker Meetings= NUCA regularly hosts well known speakers including Cabinet Members and Members of Parliament such as Ken Clarkehttp://www.nottinghampost.com/questions-local- politicians/story-19980467-detail/story.html and Anna Soubry. NUCA also invites a number of speakers from Conservative think-tanks and campaign groups. =Campaigning= NUCA often campaigns in local and general elections in the constituency of Nottingham South. In response to the election of the controversial figure Malia Bouattia as President of the NUS, NUCA was heavily involved in the 2016 'No To NUS' campaign, which sought to disaffiliate The University of Nottingham from the NUS following evidence of institutional anti-semitism, racism and homophobia within the NUS. =Social Events= Social Events often include bar and pub crawls such as the annual Fox Hunt and Oktober Revolution. Traditionally, NUCA members are invited to join together for formal dinners every year, notably for the Christmas Annual Dinner and the Vice-President's Annual Dinner (it is customary for the Vice-President to invite a special guest to the latter). Other social events have included Wine & Cheese Evenings, informal dinners and drinks receptions.

Roepers (‚ÄúAlex‚Äù). Atlantic has 29 employees worldwide with offices in New York City and Tokyo. As of June 2019, the firm had $1.4 billion in assets under management. History Alexander J. Roepers founded Atlantic Investment Management in 1988. Atlantic manages concentrated long/short equity portfolios and employs fundamental analysis with a bottom-up stock picking approach to create its portfolios, conducting in-house research to make its investments. The firm often takes large stakes‚Äîup to 7% of the shares outstanding‚Äîin a small number of stocks. Atlantic investment funds include the Cambrian Fund, Cambrian Japan, AJR/Quest, Cambrian Global and Cambrian Europe. Atlantic‚Äôs largest fund, the Cambrian Fund, is a long-only activist fund that generally invests in only 6 or 7 securities. In 1992, Atlantic began the Cambrian strategy, investing in a concentrated portfolio of approximately six medium to low-tech industrial companies. In 1993, Roepers launched AJR International, an offshore hedge fund. The firm invests in various sectors including packaging, aerospace, pumps and valves, industrial materials, specialty chemicals, information-technology services and food companies. The firm looks for stocks between $1 billion and $30 billion in market cap, with high quality balance sheets and low debt expenses. Activist philosophy While Atlantic is widely considered to be an activist investor, Roepers has been called the gentlemen activist. Roepers leads Atlantic using a more subtle approach to engaging corporate management called Constructive Shareholder Activism, which involves making suggestions behind the scenes rather than in public. Leadership Alex Roepers is the Founder, President and Portfolio Manager of Atlantic Investment Management. He has been in the investment business for more than 25 years. Prior to founding Atlantic, Roepers worked for Dover Corporation as Director of Corporate Development and at Thyssen-Bornemisza Group, both multi-billion industrialized conglomerates.

In 2013, she became the first US service member to succeed in petitioning the Defense Department to publicly change her gender identification on all her military records. Early life Sandeen was born Stephen Mark Sandeen in Northridge, California. Her father is Jack Sandeen, a film and television costume designer. At age 14, Sandeen became aware of her own gender dysphoria, as she felt her developing body did not match her gender identity. Navy service Sandeen served as a fire controlman in the US Navy from 1980 to 2000. During her service, Sandeen primarily focused on the maintenance of equipment used in the aiming and firing of guns and missiles. She worked in bases throughout the Northern Hemisphere and served on four ships. She was discharged with a 100% disability rating (service-related). Gender transition In the late 1990s, Sandeen began seriously considering transitioning after she left the Navy. She started the process in February 2003 and officially took on the first name Autumn in July 2003. Sandeen has worked to change all official records - including those pertaining to her retirement pay and retirement services - to match her female gender identity. In 2011, she collaborated with the National Center for Transgender Equality to construct a methodology for transsexual veterans to change their gender identification in Veterans Administration databases. In 2012, she was issued a new birth certificate that acknowledged her female identity. The Department of Defense was the last governmental body that still recorded Sandeen's gender as male. Sandeen worked with OutServe- SLDN to determine the required documentation for changing one's gender in Department of Defense databases. Sandeen's change established a procedure for transgender veterans who have completed reassignment surgery to alter their gender identity on Pentagon records. She received a letter officially confirming her identification as female in Department of Defense records effective April 12, 2013. GLAAD hailed Sandeen as the first service member to publicly change her gender identification under the Department of Defense. Transgender activism Sandeen served as board member within the Transgender Advocacy and Services Center San Diego from 2006 to 2008. She was arrested twice in 2010 for handcuffing herself to the White House fence in protest of Don't Ask Don't Tell. Upon release, Sandeen spoke out about the transphobic mistreatment she experienced while in prison. Sandeen currently blogs for The Transadvocate. She lives in San Diego, California.

Mulkey (May 24, 1824 ‚Äì July 9, 1905) was an American attorney and judge from Kentucky. Mulkey worked a series of jobs until William J. Allen loaned him his law books in 1851 so that he could study. Two years later, Mulkey was admitted to the bar and practiced in Southern Illinois. He served a short term on an Illinois circuit court and then was elected to the Supreme Court of Illinois in 1879 for a nine-year term. Biography John H. Mulkey was born in Monroe County, Kentucky on May 24, 1824. He was the second son born to physician Isaac Mulkey and Abigail Ragin. The family moved to LaFayette, Kentucky when Mulkey was young. Upon reaching adulthood, Mulkey moved to nearby Hopkinsville, Kentucky to apprentice as a tailor. Mulkey then attended Bacon College, where he trained to become a teacher. He moved to Southern Illinois upon graduating, settling in Benton after a lengthy search. Mulkey taught there until 1847. In July 1847, Mulkey enlisted as a volunteer to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was mustered out when the conflict ended the next year.

He had special expertise in two areas, including colorectal cancer and colorectal surgery. He was credited as the founder of the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life.  Background and education  After serving three years as a United States Army surgeon, Dr. Klatt returned to school and became a colorectal specialist. He received his medical degree in 1968 from the University of Minnesota Medical School. Dr. Klatt completed his internship at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado, his residency at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington, and his fellowship at the University of Minnesota. He is a Fellow in the American College of Surgeons.  Relay For Life  In the mid-1980s, Dr. Klatt expressed interest in helping raise funds for his local American Cancer Society. He decided he would raise money by doing something he enjoyed‚Äîrunning marathons. In May 1985, Dr. Klatt circled the track for a total of more than 83 miles at Baker Stadium at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma for 24 hours. Friends and family donated $25 to run or walk certain lengths with him. That year, he raised $27,000. While he ran, nearly 300 friends, family, and patients watched as he ran and walked the track. While he was running, Dr. Klatt began making plans on how the event could be even bigger in future years. Throughout the next year, he, along with an event committee, developed plans for the City of Destiny Classic 24-Hour Run Against Cancer. In 1986, 19 teams took part in the first team relay event and raised $33,000. Since then, Dr. Klatt‚Äôs idea has turned into more than 5,200 Relay For Life events across the United States that have raised nearly $5 billion. The American Cancer Society also licenses twenty non-governmental cancer organizations in other countries to hold Relay For Life events.  Cancer diagnosis  In March 2012, Dr. Klatt was diagnosed with stomach cancer, and he participated that year in Relay For Life for the first time as a cancer survivor. When he was diagnosed, he received a number of supportive letters and e-mails from around the world, and he spoke during the opening ceremonies at the Relay For Life of Tacoma, Washington. He died August 3, 2014, at the age of 71 from heart failure after battling stomach cancer.  Awards and recognition  Dr. Klatt has been recognized by a number of organizations including the Tacoma Rotary Club No. 8 with their Community Service Award and St. Thomas University, his alma mater, with the Humanitarian Award. His high school alma mater, Stillwater Area High School in Stillwater, Minnesota, recognized him in 1995 with the Distinguished Alumni Award. Dr. Klatt was inducted into the Relay For Life Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2008, he was recognized with a Community Impact Award from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. He has also been honored with Patients‚Äô Choice Awards from PatientsChoice.org in 2009, 2012 and 2013. In 2013, Dr. Klatt and other Relay For Life volunteers in Tacoma were recognized in the Tacoma Hometown Heroes program with the Community Partnership Award for their 27 years of dedication to the Relay For Life movement.

The company was created by Andr√© Coyne and is a subsidiary of Tractebel. History The company was established by Andr√© Coyne in 1947 as Engineering Consultancy Andr√© Coyne et Jean Bellier (ACJB). Of the many projects the company designed, the Tignes Dam in France which was completed in 1952 which was followed by the Bin el Ouidane Dam in Morocco in 1953. In 1959, the Kariba Dam along the Zambia/Zimbabwe border was completed and the Malpasset Dam in France, which was completed in 1954, had a tragic failure. In the same year work was complete on two reactors at the Marcoule Nuclear Site in France along with the Yat√© Dam in New Caledonia. In 1960, the Serre-Pon√ßon Dam was completed and Andr√© Coyne died. Two years later ACJB became Coyne et Bellier. They continued to design dams that were completed to include their 100th dam, Jatiluhur Dam in Indonesia, Daniel-Johnson Dam in Canada (1968) and Tour Aurore office building in France (1970).

The platform allows users to chat, entertain, and perform on a Stage‚Äîlive microphone slots for up to 5 people, form and join large groups based on common interests, send instant messages and drop images and voice recordings into conversations. Launched under its original name of Palringo in 2006, the app has 80 million accounts worldwide and offers a range of games along with more than 380,000 groups, some of which have up to 2,500 members. Headquartered in London, WOLF has offices in Newcastle and London, UK, and Amman, Jordan. As of March 2015, the company had revenues of $14 million in 2014, up 100% from $7 million in 2013. The company has also been recognised by The Sunday Times Tech Track 100 2015, the measurement of the UK's fastest growing tech companies where it was placed 7th out of 100 companies. Palringo has also been shortlisted in the Innovation of a Business Model and Social & Entertainment categories of the prestigious 2015 Meffys awards. History The World‚Äôs Online Festival was founded as Palringo in Newcastle in 2006 by 21-year-old engineering student, Martin Rosinski, who developed it as a communications tool for his father's engineering company to help engineers resolve problems in the field. When problems were detected it enabled affected parties to communicate with each other. In August 2006, Northstar Ventures invested, a seed of ¬£650,000 being raised to help build a user base. In 2010, Palringo launched an enterprise version of the app, offering companies private group communication networks, with notable clients including Smartlogic and 3M. Previously, Palringo was also available on now- legacy platforms including Windows Mobile, Symbian OS, and BlackBerry OS.https://www.windowscentral.com/review-palringo-instant-messaging Re-brand from Palringo to The World‚Äôs Online Festival In February, 2020, Palringo officially re-branded to The World‚Äôs Online Festival (WOLF), with the release of version 10.1 for iOS and Android platforms. The catalyst for this re-brand was the burgeoning user-base creating audio-focused shows within the app. The app realigned itself in the digital space to brand itself as an \\"entertainment\\" application, positing its new direction as \\"an incredible user-created world filled with Group Chat, Live Audio Shows, Friendship and Entertainment\\". Expansion In August 2012, Palringo began a shift away from the B2B market towards the consumer community, where users were forming groups with particular interests, with a specific focus on games. The business model entails selling virtual products such decorative profile stickers, Bots and functional utilities. In May 2014, Palringo acquired Swedish games developer Free Lunch Design (FLD), who previously worked with Disney, Paramount and Marvel, with a view to integrating Palringo's instant messaging technology into community-orientated games. In September 2014, the company reiterated its strategy on combining games and instant messaging by focusing on adding gaming capabilities on top of an already existing messaging platform. In May 2015, Palringo continued to expand by acquiring Finnish chat games developer Tribe Studios, best known for its patented Dramagame technology, which it uses to develop multiplayer role-playing games. In late 2019, Palringo introduces Stages, a platform within its app that allowed up to five users to broadcast live audio within their chat group. Charity In 2013, the company launched a charitable initiative aimed at their users in the Gulf region during the month of Ramadan, which enabled users to donate Palringo credits through a special charity Bot. They raised over US$230,000 for Charity Right and Islamic Relief. During Ramadan in 2015, Palringo raised more than $300,000 from its gaming community to be split between Action Against Hunger and Islamic Relief Worldwide.

The shell is a smooth, gently expanding orthocone with straight transvers to oblique and slightly sinuous sutures. Some are dorso-ventrally flattened so as to be slightly depressed. The hyponomic sinus, through which the funnel projects, appears to be trilobate. The siphuncle begins orthochoanitic (segments straight tubular) and central, becoming cyrtochoatitic (segments inflated) and subcentral with growth. Endosiphuncular deposits tend to grow forward, normally completed annularly at the septal foremina (openings) before fusing ventrally. Cameral deposits are mural, and heavier ventrally and dorsally. Dolorthoceras is recognized as a pseudorthocerid, nautiloid cephalopods that resemble but are not true orthocerids. It is assigned to the family Spyroceratidae along with such genera as Spyroceras, Adnatoceras, and Euloxoceras. Orientation during life was horizontal, as indicated by the cameral and endosiphuncular deposits. The animal may have been somewhat squid-like morphologically, but its behavior was probably not at all squid-like. It was most likely an ambush predator lying in wait here and there on the shallow sea bottom. References * Walter C.
